Joe Kennedy formally announces US Senate campaign", "language": "en", "text": "U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy III formally declared his candidacy for the U.S. Senate on Saturday, becoming the first member of the Kennedy political dynasty to bid for the upper chamber of Congress since Edward M. Kennedy in 1962.\n\nThe Massachusetts Democrat spoke to supporters gathered in a community center during a kickoff event in East Boston, where the Kennedy clan first settled after arriving from Ireland well over a century ago.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has forced a long overdue reckoning in America, and how we respond will say everything about who we are,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWe have to take on the broken system that gave rise to him in the first place \u2014 the outdated structures and old rules, the everyday oppressions and injustices that hold our people back.\u201d\n\nJoe Kennedy is a grandson of Robert F. Kennedy, who was attorney general in his own brother John F. Kennedy\u2019s White House and was a senator running for the Democratic presidential nomination when he was assassinated in 1968. JFK was felled by an assassin\u2019s bullet five years earlier, in 1963.\n\nThe 38-year-old Joe Kennedy will face 73-year-old incumbent Sen. Edward Markey in next year\u2019s Democratic primary.\n\nAsked how he differs from Markey, Kennedy ticked off a series of issues he supports including getting political action committee money out of politics, creating term limits for Supreme Court justices and abolishing the Electoral College. But he declined to criticize Markey directly.\n\n\u201cSenator Markey is a good man,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is going to be a tough race.\u201d\n\nMarkey on Saturday challenged those running against him, including Kennedy, to a climate change debate in November. Markey sees the fight against climate change and his push for the Green New Deal as signature issues in his re-election campaign.\n\n\u201cI was very disappointed at the Democratic National Committee\u2019s refusal to hold a debate on climate change for our presidential candidates,\u201d Markey said in a video released Saturday morning. \u201cSo today I\u2019m challenging Congressman Joe Kennedy, Shannon Liss-Riordan and Steve Pemberton to a climate change debate, and to do it very soon.\u201d\n\nLiss-Riordan, a workers\u2019 rights lawyer, and Pemberton, a former senior executive at Walgreens, are also challenging Markey.\n\nSome Democratic activists have said they\u2019re worried that a Senate primary between two high-profile Democrats could drain money and resources away from the party\u2019s top priority: defeating President Donald Trump.\n\nKennedy brushed aside those concerns.\n\n\u201cEngaging more people in that process, bringing more voices to the table, fighting back against that \u2014 how is that a bad thing?\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cPeople that are trying to say that this is going to divert resources \u2014 I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case.\u201d\n\nJoe Kennedy\u2019s father, Joseph Kennedy II, also served in Congress and attended the kickoff event. Others Kennedy family members elected to office include former U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy II and Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, who served two terms as Maryland\u2019s lieutenant governor.\n\nFirst elected to Congress in 2012, Kennedy has tried to position himself as more of a pragmatist than those on the left of his party.\n\nNevertheless, Kennedy has adopted many of the causes driving the party\u2019s liberal wing. He has called for Congress to initiate impeachment efforts against Trump and has backed a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d bill in the House. He has also said he supports the Green New Deal initiative to combat climate change, something Markey is championing along with Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York \u2014 who has endorsed Markey.\n\nGiven his political pedigree , Kennedy has been seen as a rising star in the party. In 2018, he was tapped to deliver the Democratic response to Trump\u2019s State of the Union address.\n\nA Kennedy-Markey contest will put more than a few high-profile Democrats in an awkward position, most notably Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the White House hopeful from Massachusetts.\n\nWarren has worked with Markey in the Senate and taught Kennedy at Harvard Law School. She formally endorsed Markey before Kennedy floated the idea of a challenge to Markey.\n\nMarkey, who joined thousands of young climate change activists who rallied in Boston on Friday as part of a global, youth-led day of environmental action, has the backing of many environmental activists.\n\nOne of those groups \u2014 Environment Massachusetts \u2014 has vowed to raise $5 million to help Markey win re-election.\n\n\u201cWe are lucky to have one of the nation\u2019s strongest climate champions, Ed Markey, representing Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate,\u201d Ben Hellerstein, state director for Environment Massachusetts, said in a prepared statement, explaining that voters need to understand Markey\u2019s record on renewable energy, clean water, clean air and the protection of public lands.", "description": "U.S. Rep.
