The position gave him sweeping power to investigate Mr. Trump and his administration \u2014 and he used it.\n\nHe sparred with Mr. Trump in the most public of ways. In February, he summoned the president\u2019s former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, to testify about hush money payments to women who claimed to have had an affair with Mr. Trump; Mr. Cohen denounced Mr. Trump as a \u201cracist\u201d and a \u201ccon man.\u201d And he issued subpoenas for Mr. Trump\u2019s financial records; Mr. Trump responded by suing him, prompting him to call the president\u2019s effort to block congressional inquiries \u201cfar worse than Watergate.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with The Times in May, Mr. Cummings was asked what message he would like to send to the president.\n\n\u201cI want to send a message that we have one life to live, Mr. President,\u201d he replied. \u201cThis is no dress rehearsal. And that the American people simply want to live their lives without fear of their leaders. And we, as leaders, have a duty and a responsibility to keep our promise to them when we ran for office and won \u2014 and that is to make their lives better. While we\u2019re all on this earth, that\u2019s my message.\u201d", "description": "A son of sharecroppers, he fought tirelessly for his hometown, Baltimore, and became a key figure in the impeachment investigation of President Trump.", "authors": ["Sheryl Gay Stolberg", "David Stout"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/23/obituaries/00Cummings1-sub/00Cummings1-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
