Japan steel group head: weaker global steel output shows world economy in slowdown TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan Iron and Steel Federation Chairman Yoshihisa Kitano said on Tuesday that a year-on-year fall in global crude steel output in September, which was the first drop in 41 months, underlined a slowdown in the world economy. Global crude steel output in September fell 0.3% from a year earlier to 151.5 million tonnes, the first decline since April 2016. Kitano, who is also president of JFE Steel, a unit of JFE Holdings (T: ), also told a news conference that higher steel exports from India and Russia to ASEAN, reflecting a slower economy in Europe and India, are weighing on Asian steel markets.\n\nJapan steel group head: weaker global steel output shows world economy in slowdown", "description": "Japan steel group head: weaker global steel output shows world economy in slowdown", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA7D094_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
