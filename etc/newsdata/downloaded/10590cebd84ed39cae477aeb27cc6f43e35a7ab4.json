What is most disturbing is that [the attack was] on a prison. To hit such a building is shocking and saddening \u2013 prisoners are protected by international law.\u201d\n\nRauchenstein said more than 100 people were estimated to be dead and at least 40 survivors were being treated for their injuries in hospitals in the city, south of the capital, Sana\u2019a.\n\nQuick guide The Yemen conflict Show Hide How long has the war been going on? Yemen has been troubled by civil wars for decades, but the current conflict intensified in March 2015 when a Saudi-led coalition intervened on behalf of the internationally recognised government against Houthi rebels aligned with the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh. The war is widely regarded as having turned a poor country into a humanitarian catastrophe. Riyadh expected its air power, backed by regional coalition including the United Arab Emirates, could defeat the Houthi insurgency in a matter of months. Instead some reports suggest nearly 100,000 people have died. Others put the death toll much lower, but fighting this year alone has displaced 250,000 people. There are more than 30 active front lines. A total of 80% of the population \u2013 more than 24 million people \u2013 need assistance and protection, including 10 million who rely on food aid to survive. What is the cause of the war? Its roots lie in the Arab spring. Pro-democracy protesters took to the streets in a bid to force the president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to end his 33-year rule. He responded with economic concessions but refused to resign. By March 2011, tensions on the streets of the capital city, Sana\u2019a, resulted in protesters dying at the hands of the military. Following an internationally brokered deal, there was a transfer of power in November to the vice-president, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, paving the way for elections in February 2012 \u2013 in which he was the only candidate to lead a transitional government. Hadi\u2019s attempts at constitutional and budget reforms were rejected by Houthi rebels from the north. The Houthis belong to a small branch of Shia Muslims known as Zaydis. They captured the capital, forcing Hadi to flee eventually to Riyadh. What has happened to the peace process? The UN brokered an agreement in Stockholm in December 2018 to demilitarise the Red Sea city of Hodeidah, and after five months of tortuous talks a small part of the agreement has been implemented on the ground. The Houthis had promised a two-phase redeployment out of the city, and agreed that an alternative force \u2013 poorly defined in the Stockholm agreement \u2013 would take over security in the areas they vacated. But talks between the Houthis and the UAE-backed government forces stalled over the details. Faced by an impasse, the UN sanctioned a unilateral Houthi withdrawal from the three main ports on Yemen\u2019s Red Sea coast \u2013 Hodeidah, Ras Issa and Saleef. The Yemeni government described the withdrawal as a sham, saying the Houthis had merely rebadged their fighters as coastguards. They pressed for the resignation of Martin Griffiths, the UN special envoy for Yemen. Not everyone in the Yemen government agreed with this analysis and the foreign minister quit. No progress has been made on the second phase of redeployment, or the exchange of political prisoners. Griffiths is now trying to secure enough progress in Hodeidah to get off this hook and say the time is ripe for wider political talks on a transitional government to be held in Bonn.

The coalition has been blacklisted by the UN for the killing of children, while Saudi Arabia and its allies accuse the Houthis of using civilians as human shields in densely populated areas.\n\nBefore the ICRC\u2019s comments, the coalition had insisted the strike was conducted against \u201ca military compound which was a legitimate military target\u201d.\n\nIt said secondary explosions indicated the building was used to store weapons and that the Houthis were masking its identity by \u201cclaiming it was a secret prison\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is a traditional Houthi tactic and a violation of the laws of armed conflict. This site was not registered with the United Nations [and] was not on the no-strike list,\u201d said a coalition spokesman, Col Turki Al-Malk.\n\nThe coalition earlier said that it \u201ctook all precautionary measures to protect civilians\u201d, but the Houthi television channel Almasirah said dozens of people had been killed and wounded in seven airstrikes that hit the building.", "description": "Saudi-led military coalition claimed it targeted a military storage facility run by Houthi rebels", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse", "Anna Stavrianakis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cdca2b04de1a6c9a9b5a66fd4c925ad62c67a42/0_96_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=84b291904ff096efa61b28b3e5284ada"}
