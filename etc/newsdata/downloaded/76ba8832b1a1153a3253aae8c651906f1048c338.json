Fiat shares rose 8% in Milan and PSA gained 6%.\n\nIn Asia, the Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.5%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 gauge dropped 0.6%.\n\nStock futures linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average drifted down 0.1%. Investors are largely holding off from making major moves until the conclusion of the Fed's monetary policy meeting later in the day, said Daniel Lacalle, chief economist and chief investment officer at Madrid-based investment firm Tressis.\n\n\"With the two main negative catalysts in the mind of market participants -- Brexit and the U.S.-China trade war -- having been not resolved, but at least showing some light at the end of the tunnel, then monetary policy becomes the key factor,\" he said.\n\nThe central bank is widely expected to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point after markets close. Key data during the day will also give investors and policy makers additional clues on the state of the economy.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 30, 2019 05:38 ET (09:38 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
