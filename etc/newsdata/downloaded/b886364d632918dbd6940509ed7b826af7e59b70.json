A partial answer is that the media are to blame. Back in 1993, a cover story in the Nation identified the gay rights cause as the summit and keystone of the culture war: All the crosscurrents of present-day liberation struggles are subsumed in the gay struggle. The gay moment is in some ways similar to the moment that other communities have experienced in the nation\u2019s past, but it is also something more, because sexual identity is in crisis throughout the population, and gay people\u2014at once the most conspicuous subjects and objects of the crisis\u2014have been forced to invent a complete cosmology to grasp it. No one says the changes will come easily. But it\u2019s just possible that a small and despised sexual minority will change America forever.\n\nWe have gone beyond gay people to allow transgender people \u2014 fewer than one percent of the population \u2014 to change America forever.\n\nProgressives! They make a desert and call it peace. They carve a gash and call it a vagina. They make us all insane, and call the sane crazy.\n\nIf you want to save yourself and your children from this doom, turn your back on it now. Let the dead bury their dead. Let our finest surgeons gouge holes into our mentally ill young people, and call them heroes.\n\nWhat about the Hippocratic Oath? Here you have someone declaring on the pages of The New York Times that the surgery he is about to have will not make him happier, and in fact may drive him to suicide. But he doesn\u2019t care. He wants that he wants. In a just order, those surgeons would be charged with a crime if they go through with this. Desire is the only criterion of health, is that where we are now? What if someone desires to have their legs amputated? Or to commit suicide? Where are the limits?\n\nNihilists. We are nothing but nihilists. We are wicked and deserve to be judged.\n\nUPDATE: From Andrea Long Chu\u2019s Go Fund Me appeal for surgery:\n\nTransition is expensive. I\u2019m lucky enough to have insurance that covers hormones and (most of) vaginoplasty, which I am getting in November. Everything else, including facial feminization surgery, hip augmentation surgery, vocal surgery, is considered \u201ccosmetic,\u201d and therefore insurance won\u2019t cover it. That makes paying out of pocket the only option. I live on a stipend from NYU, where I\u2019m a doctoral student, plus money I make writing freelance. I\u2019m hoping to sell a trade book in the next year, but that remains to be seen, and even if it\u2019s a good deal it may not free up the funds necessary for my surgeries. Dysphoria can be hard to describe. I\u2019ve said elsewhere it feels like heartbreak. I like to talk a big talk about how all transition-related surgeries are cosmetic, and they are\u2014no one wants to transition into an ugly person\u2014but it\u2019s also true that without any of these surgeries my suicide risk is much, much higher.\n\nGive me money for surgery or I might kill myself. Or, according to me in The New York Times, give me money for surgery and I might kill myself anyway. It\u2019s my right!\n\nUPDATE.2: Transgender columnist at the NYT miffed that Chu is off-Narrative:\n\nIt is always good to have diverse trans voices on the page. I love that. But calling the business \u201ca wound\u201d instead of the gooshy miracle it is? Emphasizing misery and suffering and self-loathing? Is that what is most needed to be shouted into the megaphone at this perilous hour? \u2014 Jennifer Finney Boylan ?

This is the kind of thing they\u2019re talking about at one of America\u2019s great universities. The paper is titled \u201cDid Sissy Porn Make Me Trans?\u201d There are no images, but don\u2019t click through to it and start reading unless you are prepared to go to an extremely dark place. I almost didn\u2019t post this here, but after thinking about it, I concluded that it\u2019s actually vitally important to know.\n\nI\u2019m going to summarize the paper for those who don\u2019t want to read it. Again, I cannot caution you strongly enough about its content, and the pornographic images Chu describes in detail in the paper.\n\nThe paper\u2019s title comes from a comment Chu saw on an online forum. \u201cSissy porn,\u201d we learn from the paper, is a genre in which submissive men are forced to have sex with other men, in such a way that their masculinity is forcibly taken from them. Chu says this genre is also called \u201cforced feminization porn.\u201d Chu says that sissy porn explicitly intends to turn male viewers into transsexuals, in part by \u201cinstruct[ing] them to understand their addiction to the genre as constitutive of their own feminization.\u201d Chu writes:\n\nNow Jon would hardly be the first closeted trans woman whose gender dysphoria felt like porn addiction. Indeed, the internet is full of women like this, if you know where to look. The phenomenon is common enough, in fact, to have given rise to an entire subgenre of anxiety fielding on the popular discussion website Reddit. In typical post from 2014, titled \u201cDid sissy porn make me trans or was I trans all along?,\u201d one user writes: \u201cAbout 3 years ago, I discovered sissy hypno videos [that\u2019s \u201chypno\u201d like short for \u201chypnotism\u201d], which in a nutshell are flashing subjective images telling you to wear panties, be girly\u2026 and even take hormones. I became completely obsessed with these videos\u2026.\u201d\n\nThis person is now \u201c95% sure she is trans,\u201d writes Chu.\n\nNow, imagine a confused 12-year-old boy \u2014 perhaps one experiencing same-sex desires \u2014 finding sissy porn on his smartphone, and giving himself over to it. It\u2019s only a few clicks away.\n\nChu goes on to talk about the dynamics of sissy porn. Here\u2019s is a key portion, one I can quote here\n\nSissyhood is not the obliteration of subjectivity, but its diminishment. Sissies have selves, in other words, but these selves are simplified, emptied, dumb. The technical term for this is bimboification. Numerous captions instruct spectators to submit themselves to hypnosis, brainwashing, brain-melting, and other techniques for scooping out intelligence.\n\nChu describes, unprintably, that the porn video\u2019s explicit instructions order the viewer to surrender his entire to the sexually dominant male\u2019s desires. The act of sexual submission is not only castration, and the willed destruction of the submissive\u2019s masculinity, it is \u2014 this is crucial \u2014 also the willed destruction of personhood. Of sexualizing the desire for obliteration.\n\nWhat Chu describes here is the process of demonic possession. If that is what is in Andrea Long Chu\u2019s head, no wonder he is depressed and suicidal. This is profoundly evil stuff.\n\nUPDATE.4: Read this comment. Do you let your kid have a smartphone and/or unsupervised Internet access? You might want to rethink that:\n\nThe third update really struck a cord with me. I am familiar with sissy porn, having discovered it in high school, and it\u2019s much broader than what Chu is referring to. Some background on me: I am a millennial, I was raised Catholic, and I first discovered Internet porn at a friend\u2019s house when I was 12 years old. When I was in high school and we first got Internet access at home, I used it to look for porn when no one was around. In the first few years, I had pretty typical straight teenage boy interests when it came to porn. Having been poorly formed in male-female dynamics, however, I was very interested in having power over women, and this led me to search for hypnosis. Since this was a very small niche back then (I imagine there\u2019s a large catalog for every fetish out there now), I absorbed whatever material I could find, and within a few months, this led me to the site of a woman who specialized in hypnotizing men and making them think they were women. Although the latter part just seemed gross, as I had no interest in being a woman, something about the power exchange appealed to me, even though it never did before. I have a theory that this is a pattern for frequent porn users: they may initially look for other things, but with enough exposure, they desire to be a passive sexual participant since it involves less effort on their part. Despite the feminization aspect, I kept going down this rabbit hole as the thought of being the submissive one was appealing. So I did my best to avoid the sissy stuff at first, reading stories, downloading audios, and later watching videos where women claimed to hypnotize men (there is a whole cottage industry of female hypnotists who record audios and videos for this purpose, which I would not encourage you or your readers to investigate). As much as I tried to avoid it, though, the sissy audios and videos were hard to miss. There was clearly a market for it since so much was being produced, and I would occasionally partake when it was what I could find for free. Eventually, I didn\u2019t care what they asked me to do in these recordings. Being under the power of a woman was what was appealing. By the time I reached my 20s, I was in deep. Later in my 20s, I also discovered the free streaming porn sites, and I was eager to see what content I could find on them. I\u2019d just throw in a few hypnosis key words in my search, and the sissy hypno videos that Chu wrote about started popping up. In fact, they seemed to be the bulk of the hypnosis themed content. I clicked a few of them, since I couldn\u2019t find much else. They\u2019d usually feature transsexual images or video clips with words popping up suggesting that the viewer engage in female grooming or sexual behavior. The audio for these was either airy pop songs, the female hypnotists I\u2019d discovered before, moaning noises, or some combination of the above. The discovery of these videos led me to reflect on how big my problem had become. From high school through my 20s, I\u2019d gone from looking at pictures of naked women to watching videos of women hypnotizing men or abusing them. And you\u2019d better believe there was some transsexual porn in there too \u2013 I doubt many who look at what I looked at don\u2019t eventually come around to seeking transsexual porn, too. On the non-porn side of life, I had no ability to attract women or get a girlfriend, probably because porn had convinced me to be passive and wait for them to come to me. With no success with women as a man, transitioning seemed like it might give me a shot at happiness and sexual prospects. I began browsing transgender forums and reading their literature and web comics. I looked into what it would take for me to start hormone replacement therapy. If it weren\u2019t for my Catholic upbringing and the crazy advice they gave on these forums (lie to therapists, separate yourself from family and friends who don\u2019t respect your decision, etc.), I might have made an irreversible mistake. Although most transgender forums deny that sissy porn has any impact on their decision to transition, there are places where they are a little more forthcoming: 4chan and similar anonymous style message boards. While it\u2019s hard to tell who\u2019s telling the truth and who isn\u2019t on these boards, an awful lot of them feature transsexual/sissy porn and are frequented by posters who claim to be transsexual themselves. There\u2019s one in particular designed for lonely un(der)employed young men where threads regularly appear suggesting that they look for transsexual girlfriends or become transsexual themselves, often offering advice on how to get started. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s making all of this stuff, but with all the videos and message board posts, there is an awful lot of content being produced that seems to be designed to reach lonely young men and recruit them into the ranks of the transsexual community. Content doesn\u2019t make itself. Someone is putting a lot of effort into this. There are so many of these sissy hypnosis videos, and those take time to edit. And on 4chan and similar forums, posts disappear quickly. To keep appearing near the top, people have to start new threads, which we\u2019re not dealing with a few actors who made some videos and retired \u2013 some people are still at work trying to recruit young men who are addicted to porn and feel like they have nothing going for them. Who these actors are and what they want, I cannot say. I am fortunate that I rediscovered my faith in adulthood and got my act together. I have since married and am raising children with my wife. However, it still haunts me to think how differently things may have gone for me, and I pray regularly for boys and young men who took the other path or face a temptation to that path. I did not feel any predisposition to homosexuality or gender confusion, and yet it almost ensnared me.", "description": "", "authors": ["Rod Dreher"], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-24-at-4.41.42-PM.png", "published_at": "2018-11-24"}
