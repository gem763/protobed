Some days we get frustrated and feel overwhelmed, but today we did what was best for a child.\"\n\nA food pantry was formed after her story went viral and Lopez and Rodriguez stepped up.\n\nOn Wednesday Lopez posted a video on her official Instagram account which showed her and Rodriguez Facetiming with Goins and some students.\n\nLopez told the group her mother was a teacher and talked about how moved she and Rodriguez were before announcing that they would be sending the school a year's worth of food from a company they are part owners of, Tiller & Hatch.\n\n\"When we heard about the students and amazing teachers at Jacksboro Elementary in Tennessee, we knew we had to help,\" Lopez wrote in the caption of the video she posted. \"We heard teachers were helping students bring home food when they didn't have enough. When we saw this story, it brought tears not just to my eyes, but Alex's as well!\"\n\nLopez went on to write \"This is why being a business owner, and having actual ownership in companies (not licensing), is so important to me and Alex, especially as Latinos.\"\n\n\"We are happy to be in business with partners who also believe no child should EVER have to go to sleep hungry,\" she wrote. \"Everyone should have access to delicious, nutritious food. This was my favorite moment of the month and it's one of the best things we've been able to do.\"", "description": "Students at Jacksboro Elementary School will have food to eat for the next year thanks to Jennifer Lopez and her fianc\u00e9 Alex Rodriguez.", "authors": ["Lisa Respers France"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181128124213-alex-rodriguez-and-jennifer-lopez-2-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
