REID\n\nPresident & CEO\n\nForward-Looking Statements. This news release contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws. These statements relate to future events or the Company\u2019s future performance and are based upon the Company\u2019s internal assumptions and expectations. All statements other than statements of present or historical fact are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are often, but not always, identified by the use of any of the words \u201cexpect\u201d, \u201canticipate\u201d, \u201ccontinue\u201d, \u201cestimate\u201d, \u201cmay\u201d, \u201cwill\u201d, \u201cshould\u201d, \u201cbelieve\u201d, \"intends\u201d, \u201cforecast\u201d, \u201cplans\u201d, \u201cguidance\u201d, \u201cbudget\u201d and similar expressions.\n\nMore particularly and without limitation, this release contains forward-looking statements and information relating to the use of proceeds from the Offerings; the completion of the Recapitalization Transaction and the timing thereof; the Company\u2019s future drilling and development plans; the Company\u2019s future business plans and strategy; the Company\u2019s future liquidity and financial capacity; and anticipated results from the Recapitalization Transaction. The forward-looking statements and information contained in this release are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by Delphi. The following are certain material assumptions on which the forward-looking statements and information contained in this release are based: satisfaction of all conditions to completion of the Offerings and the Recapitalization Transaction; the timely receipt of required regulatory, shareholder, noteholder, lender and other approvals; that no event will occur that would trigger termination rights in respect of the Recapitalization Transaction; the stability of the global and national economic environment, the stability of and commercial acceptability of tax, royalty and regulatory regimes applicable to Delphi, exploitation and development activities being consistent with management\u2019s expectations, production levels of Delphi being consistent with management\u2019s expectations, the absence of significant project delays, the stability of oil and gas prices, the absence of significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates, the stability of costs of oil and gas development and production in Western Canada, including operating costs, the timing and size of development plans and capital expenditures, availability of third party infrastructure for transportation, processing or marketing of oil and natural gas volumes, prices and availability of oilfield services and equipment being consistent with management\u2019s expectations, the availability of, and competition for, among other things, pipeline capacity, skilled personnel and drilling and related services and equipment, results of development and exploitation activities that are consistent with management\u2019s expectations, weather affecting Delphi\u2019s ability to develop and produce as expected, contracted parties providing goods and services on the agreed timeframes, Delphi\u2019s ability to manage environmental risks and hazards and the cost of complying with environmental regulations, the accuracy of operating cost estimates, the accurate estimation of oil and gas reserves, future exploitation, development and production results and Delphi\u2019s ability to market oil and natural gas successfully to current and new customers. Additionally, estimates as to expected average annual production rates assume that no unexpected outages occur in the infrastructure that the Company relies on to produce its wells, that existing wells continue to meet production expectations and any future wells scheduled to come on in the coming year meet timing and production expectations.\n\nCommodity prices used in the determination of forecast revenues are based upon general economic conditions, commodity supply and demand forecasts and publicly available price forecasts. The Company continually monitors its forecast assumptions to ensure the stakeholders are informed of material variances from previously communicated expectations.\n\nAlthough the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements and information are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct and such forward-looking statements should not be unduly relied upon. Since forward-looking statements and information address future events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Delphi\u2019s actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements and, accordingly, no assurance can be given that any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will transpire or occur, or if any of them do so, what benefits Delphi will derive therefrom. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should assumptions underlying forward-looking statements prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks. These include, but are not limited to, the risks associated with the oil and gas industry in general such as operational risks in development, exploration and production, delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures, the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to production rates, costs and expenses, commodity price and exchange rate fluctuations, marketing and transportation, environmental risks, competition from others for scarce resources, the ability to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources, changes in governmental regulation of the oil and gas industry and changes in tax, royalty and environmental legislation. Additional information on these and other factors that could affect the Company\u2019s operations or financial results are included in the Company\u2019s most recent Annual Information Form and other reports on file with the applicable securities regulatory authorities and may be accessed through the SEDAR website ( www.sedar.com ).\n\nReaders are cautioned that the foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. Furthermore, the forward-looking statements contained in this release are made as of the date of this release for the purpose of providing the readers with the Company\u2019s expectations for the coming year. The forward-looking statements and information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Delphi undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements or information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless so required by applicable securities laws. The forward-looking statements contained in this release are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.", "description": "", "authors": ["Delphi Energy Corporation"], "top_image": "http://www.globenewswire.com/Attachment/LogoDisplay/441951?filename=441951.jpg&size=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
