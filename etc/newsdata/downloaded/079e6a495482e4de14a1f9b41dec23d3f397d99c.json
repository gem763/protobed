The blockade of Iran will break.\"\n\n- Going 'soft?' -\n\nIf Tehran sees optimism in Bolton's ouster, some hawkish US lawmakers warned that easing the squeeze on Iran would be an enormous mistake, enabling Europe to, in Senator Ted Cruz's words, \"send an economic lifeline to the Ayatollah.\"\n\nCruz tweeted that he hoped Bolton's departure \"does not mean that the deep-state forces at State and Treasury -- who have been fighting tooth and nail to preserve the Obama Iran nuclear deal -- have finally convinced the president to go soft on Iran.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration announced new terrorist designations against leaders or operatives of organizations with close ties to Tehran, among them Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force and Hezbollah.\n\nThe US also designated leaders of groups within the Islamic State and Al-Qaeda, and the operational arm of Hamas.\n\n\"You know we've done more sanctions on Iran than anybody, and it's absolutely working,\" Mnuchin said.\n\nTensions have been escalating between Iran and the United States since May last year, when Trump pulled out of the 2015 nuclear accord with Tehran and began reimposing sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy.\n\nOn Tuesday, Washington joined Israel in accusing Iran of new deceptions about its nuclear program, a move that further strained European-led attempts to salvage a multinational deal.\n\nIran denounced the accusations leveled on Monday by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said that the clerical regime operated a previously undisclosed site aimed at developing nuclear weapons but destroyed it after it was detected.\n\nPompeo, without directly referencing Netanyahu, urged Iran to comply with the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\n\"The Iranian regime's lack of full cooperation with @iaeaorg raises questions about possible undeclared nuclear material or activities,\" Pompeo tweeted.\n\n\"The world won't fall for it. We will deny the regime all paths to a nuclear weapon.\"\n\nA potential summit between Trump and the Iranian leadership sparked interest from the mogul-turned-president, but it is adamantly opposed by Netanyahu, who faces elections next week and sees Iran as an existential threat.\n\nIn a live television address, Netanyahu showed pictures of an alleged site near Abadeh, south of Isfahan, where he said Iran conducted experiments to develop nuclear weapons.\n\nNetanyahu said Israel found out about the site during a daring raid into Tehran and that the regime demolished the site sometime between late June and late July after realizing that Israel was aware.", "description": "Two of Donald Trump's top lieutenants said Tuesday he is ready to meet his Iranian counterpart without preconditions after the US president sacked his hawkish national security advisor, while insisting there will be no easing of pressure on Tehran.
