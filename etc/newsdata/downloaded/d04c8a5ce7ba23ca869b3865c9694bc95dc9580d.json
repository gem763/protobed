Is that I think that it was poor judgment because I don\u2019t believe now, when I look back on it \u2014 I know that there was \u2014 did nothing wrong at all,\u201d he told ABC News in an exclusive interview.\n\n\u201cHowever, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is \u2026 a swamp in \u2014 in \u2014 in many ways? Yeah.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper runs interference for the Democrats, claims that Trump \u201cfalsely\u201d accused Biden of corruption Biden responds by lying, falsely claims that he never talk to his son about business. Even his son said that he did. pic.twitter.com/jxeVoHTSIU \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) October 16, 2019\n\n\u201cFalsely accused of doing something wrong\u201d journo Anderson Cooper says to Joe Biden about Hunter Biden This after every Democrat on stage asserts that Trump has clearly and unambiguously committed enough crimes to go to prison for life, and no usage of \u201calleged\u201d Seems fair \u2014 Buck Sexton (@BuckSexton) October 16, 2019\n\nAnderson Cooper really just said Trump FALSELY accused Hunter Biden of wrongdoing. Cooper, your bias is showing. #DemDebate \u2014 Jessica Fletcher (@heckyessica) October 16, 2019\n\nAnderson Cooper and Joe Biden both falsely state that Hunter Biden did nothing wrong. Taking $50k/month from a Ukrainian company that is paying you only for access to the Vice President (your dad), is wrong. \u2014 Tim Carney (@TPCarney) October 16, 2019\n\nPoor Anderson Cooper \"pooted in public\" when he asserted that Biden was \"falsely\" accused\u2026I'm surprised Cooper didn't start crying as to how much he loved Biden and hated @realDonaldTrump . He validated the @JamesOKeefeIII and @Project_Veritas revelation! \u2014 Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) October 16, 2019\n\nAnderson Cooper prefaces his question: \"VP Biden, you have been falsely accused by Trump of Ukrainian corruption\u2026\" EYEROLL.
