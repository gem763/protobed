Sheffield\u2019s sturdy defence\n\nThe home side gave an impressive defensive display, staying stout despite conceding 73% possession to the visitors in the first period.\n\nWhen faced with Liverpool\u2019s attack, the Blades dropped back quickly and utilising a solid shape kept the league leaders at bay.\n\n2. Slightly sloppy Liverpool\n\nThis match was the first since the January meeting with Brighton in which the Reds didn\u2019t hit the target in the first half despite seven attempts.\n\nLiverpool were flustered with the winner down to a horrendous error from Henderson rather than Liverpool skill.\n\nThat said, they won which was all that mattered.\n\n3. United on the counter\n\nDespite the final result being in Liverpool\u2019s favour, the scoreline did not represent the play of the two sides with the Blades very much holding their own.\n\nAs well as defending well throughout, United countered well using a long ball down the left hand in particular to find space to attack.\n\nThe Blades missed chances of their own (PA)\n\n4. Van Dijk shows his cool\n\nLiverpool were lucky to not concede, showing lacklustre defence when faced with strength in the Sheffield United attack. The only exception was from Van Dijk, who once again was the perfect example of calm amidst the chaos around him.\n\nIf Liverpool want their winning streak to continue they\u2019ll have to tighten up.\n\n5. Blades need more cutting edge\n\nUnited played well, holding their own against the Premier League leaders, but when they created chances, the home side let numerous opportunities get away from them.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Blades are new to the Premier League, and if they want to succeed within it need to take chances when they are offered to them.", "description": "Liverpool met Sheffield United at Bramall Lane and extended their lead at the top of the Premier League with a 16th successive win.The Reds managed to scrape a victory over the home side, with Dean Henderson\u2019s howler proving crucial as Georginio Wijnaldum\u2019s strike squirmed its way in.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TEPfNFbgeLHx3p2CbFpOVQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEwNTI7aD03MDI-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YezY5.oXl3ivKlRCeauxwg--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/e6d8b2142b4353b94a7bfcd73e742a4a", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
