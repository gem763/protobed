That\u2019s up from 36% at the start of the year and triple the level in June 2013.\n\n\u201cIt lets him monetize a large share of his wealth without foregoing influence over the firm,\u201d said Michael Puleo, assistant professor of finance at Fairfield University\u2019s Dolan School of Business in Connecticut. \u201cBut there\u2019s an elevation of crash risk. If the share price falls low enough, he could get a margin call and that could be pretty costly.\u201d\n\nThe structure highlights the extent of Son\u2019s exposure to SoftBank and its $100 billion Vision Fund. Shares in the Japanese conglomerate have been rocked recently by the postponement of WeWork\u2019s initial public offering. The delay came after the office-rental unicorn was being marketed at a steep discount to the $47 billion figure that the Tokyo-based conglomerate invested at earlier this year. That\u2019s spooked investors, who sent SoftBank\u2019s shares down 5% at one point this week as the listing unraveled, knocking $770 million off Son\u2019s net worth. The stock has still advanced roughly 27% this year.\n\nSon, 62, also has leveraged his stake in the Vision Fund, which invests in tech startups. That boosts his returns if things go well, with outsized losses if they don\u2019t. Uber Technologies (NYSE: ) Inc.\u2019s falling market capitalization and WeWork\u2019s travails are set to dent the 62% return on the fund that SoftBank reported through March.\n\n\u201cThere is a danger in companies where the founder calls all the shots regardless of whether there are loans,\u201d said Robert Pozen, a senior lecturer with the MIT Sloan School of Management in Boston. \u201cAnd when founders borrow a lot against their shares, they might be more tempted to make riskier decisions,\u201d he said, adding that borrowing against 5% of one\u2019s stake is usually considered reasonable.\n\nPay Out\n\nSoftBank\u2019s compensation plan also involves a lot of debt. Son loaned himself around $3 billion to invest in the first Vision Fund, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the information isn\u2019t public. Using loans for a private investment compounds Son\u2019s risk because he would be less able to bail himself out if things go south, Pozen said.\n\nThe loan was swapped for equity in the fund and will generate profits when deals make money -- and losses when they don\u2019t. Vision Fund employees, including high-profile bankers and investors, receive base salaries and bonuses, but only get payouts when profits are booked.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much of this compensation will be reported in SoftBank\u2019s next annual report. Son\u2019s pledged shares, which currently have a market value of $9 billion, are excluded from his net worth calculation by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. SoftBank spokeswoman Hiroe Kotera declined to comment.\n\nSoftBank is planning to lend as much as $20 billion to its employees to buy stakes in a second venture capital fund, the people said. Son may account for over half of the employee investment pool, they said.\n\nEllison, Musk\n\nPledged shares have become an increasingly common way for founders to unlock the value of a stake without selling shares. Larry Ellison has a history of pledging Oracle Corp (NYSE: ). stock to fund a lavish lifestyle, which includes trophy properties, America\u2019s Cup teams and the Indian Wells tennis tournament. About 27% of his Oracle shares -- worth more than $16 billion -- are currently pledged. Elon Musk has pledged about 40% of his stake in Tesla (NASDAQ: ) Inc., according to a May 2019 filing.\n\nStill, the move comes with risks. \u201cIf the price of our common stock were to decline substantially, Mr. Musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of Tesla common stock to satisfy his loan obligations if he could not do so through other means. Any such sales could cause the price of our common stock to decline further,\u201d Tesla warns in a filing.\n\nThe risk-loving Son, who saw $70 billion wiped from his fortune in the dot-com crash, is unlikely to be fazed. He told shareholders at the company\u2019s June meeting that SoftBank\u2019s investment portfolio could grow 33-fold to 200 trillion yen ($1.8 trillion) in 20 years.", "description": "SoftBank Founder\u2019s Empire Is\u00a0Vulnerable to WeWork Woes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picb538395f0ef577b014522e25dd234280.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
