In other words, you\u2019re a Thomas Harris bad guy, and in this book, the author\u2019s first novel in 13 years, your name is Hans-Peter Schnieder.\n\nYou know that hidden somewhere in or near a mansion on Miami\u2019s Biscayne Bay are stacks of gold bars worth $25 million to $30 million. And because you are bad to the bone, you don\u2019t care what you have to do \u2014 or to whom you have to do it \u2014 to get the hidden treasure.\n\nThe house is empty; rented from time to time to people who make horror movies, and it\u2019s filled with scary film props. The only occupant is the caretaker, a local girl named Cari Mora who sleeps there each night (because of an insurance requirement) and at times prepares food for the crews to eat.\n\nCari may look like a clueless, sweet young thing, but in fact she\u2019s the opposite. Cari is a hardened survivor of the terror in her home country of Colombia, which she fled, and where she, as a child soldier had learned to stitch up the wounds of the injured. She\u2019d like to be a veterinarian, but if she registers in a proper school in Florida, ICE will have her name and she\u2019ll be deported \u2014 or jailed. So, in addition to working at a shelter for injured birds and small animals, she takes any kind of odd job that pays. And caretaker of a house filled with horror film props is definitely an odd job.\n\nBut what Hans-Peter knows and Cari doesn\u2019t is that somewhere in or under or near the mansion lie the golden bars. He\u2019s going to sneak into the house, and if he encounters Cari and has to kill her, so be it. Or, if he decides to take her captive, he can sell her to his customers who are almost as creepy and evil as he is. Selling young women \u2014 or parts of them \u2014 is his main line of work. And if he has some of a human body left over, he gets rid of it by using his portable cremation machine \u2014 a classic Thomas Harris touch.\n\n\u201cHans-Peter was very proud of his liquid cremation machine. He\u2019d had to pay a premium for it, as liquid cremation was becoming all the rage with ecology enthusiasts eager to avoid the carbon footprint of cremation by fire. The liquid method left no carbon footprint, or print of any kind. If a girl did not work out, Hans-Peter could just pour her down the loo in liquid form \u2014 and with no harmful effect on the groundwater.\u201d\n\nDuring the day, Hans-Peter has a small crew digging up the basement of the mansion, but while they are at it, a gardener hired by the house\u2019s current owner discovers a sink hole near the sea wall. Looking down into it, he sees what Hans-Peter and his bad guys are searching for: \u201cA shiny cube larger than a refrigerator stood at the far end of the cave, almost flush against the foundation of the house \u2026 Beside the cube, at water\u2019s edge, were a human skull and the back half of a dog.\u201d\n\nHans-Peter sends a diver into the cave to size up the cube. The diver reports, \u201cIt\u2019s a box taller than it is wide \u2026 Size of a refrigerator. Bigger, like a deli refrigerator.\u201d\n\nWhat they don\u2019t know, but do suspect is that the cube is booby-trapped to prevent entry by \u201cunauthorized persons.\u201d In fact, Mr. Harris tells us, \u201c\u2026 the cube is wired with enough explosives to obliterate anyone who tries to crack it open.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s the plot, the resolution of which takes up the remainder of the book in which the author displays his characteristic inventiveness in a variety of ways. But wait, Mr. Harris has always insisted that he doesn\u2019t make up anything. In May, an interviewer wrote, \u201cOne widespread myth is that prying reporters kept trying to figure out where his twisted ideas came from, [and] \u201cAcquaintances do sometimes ask how he dreams up such lurid stories. When I asked how he replies, Harris stared at me as if the answer should be obvious. \u2018I respond that I don\u2019t make anything up. So look around you,\u2019 he says. \u2018Because everything has happened.\u2019\u201d\n\nThomas Harris may have taken time off \u2014 a baker\u2019s dozen years \u2014 from writing novels, but it certainly doesn\u2019t show. His dialogue is as crisp and fast moving as ever, and you definitely \u201csee\u201d his setting. You also find yourself rooting for the good guys and hoping the bad ones get what they deserve.\n\n\u201cCari Mora\u201d is an excellent novel for a chilly fall night, like maybe Halloween.\n\n\u2022 John Greenya, a Washington writer and critic, is the author of \u201cGorsuch: The Judge Who Speaks For Himself\u201d (Simon and Schuster, 2018).\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nCARI MORA\n\nBy Thomas Harris\n\nGrand Central Publishing, $29, 320 pages\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
