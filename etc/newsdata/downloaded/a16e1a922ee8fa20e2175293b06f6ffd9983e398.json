Some also experienced vomiting and diarrhoea. Symptoms worsened over a period of days or weeks before admission to hospital.\n\nThe outbreak has led to fears that vapers in the UK could also be affected. However, Martin Dockrell, head of Tobacco Control at Public Health England, drew a distinction between vaping in the US and the UK. He said reports suggested that most cases in the US had been linked to people using illicit vaping fluid, bought on the streets or homemade, some containing cannabis products, like THC, or synthetic cannabinoids, like spice.\n\n\u201cUnlike the US, all e-cigarette products in the UK are tightly regulated for quality and safety by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and they operate the yellow card scheme, encouraging vapers to report any bad experiences,\u201d he said.\n\nDeborah Arnott, the chief executive of the health charity Action on Smoking and Health, said that to date no serious side-effects had been reported in the UK. \u201cIn Britain, you can check on the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) website whether the product you\u2019re using has been notified and can be legally sold.\u201d\n\nThis point was backed by Prof Linda Bauld, a public health expert at Edinburgh University. \u201cIt seems highly unlikely that widely available nicotine-containing vaping products, particularly of the type regulated in Europe, are causing these cases,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the evidence to date suggests that illicit marijuana vaping products (THC oils) are the cause. In particular, a compound called tocopherol acetate may be the culprit.\u201d\n\nPaul Aveyard, a professor of behavioural medicine at the University of Oxford, said: \u201cThese cases are worrying and need investigating but advice from all official bodies in the UK is that it is always preferable to vape than to smoke. These reports should not change that advice.\u201d", "description": "Outbreak of respiratory disease in the US, where five people have died, is blamed on lax controls and illicit fluid", "authors": ["Jamie Doward", "Robin Mckie"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f22d85857fad0e91fd66c39a4d0a0f845d8dc61/87_173_2768_1661/master/2768.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=49bdfefca39c67ae0324ad27067734da", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
