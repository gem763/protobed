At least five out of nine votes are required for passage.\n\n\"The state of California and the state of New York have passed natural hair non-discrimination laws covering all of their residents, and this year the New York City Commission on Human Rights issued new guidelines protecting residents from this type of discrimination,\" said Jon Harmon, legislative director for Seelbach. \"Cincinnati is proud to be among the very first cities in America to codify a ban on this discrimination with a vote of council.\"\n\nKamara Douglas, Seelbach's administrative and community affairs director, played a key role in spearheading the proposed legislation.\n\n\"From my kinks to my coils, I have grown to love my natural hair,\" said Douglas. \"Unfortunately, we live in a world where some institutions don't think natural hair is professional or becoming. Not only is this demeaning, but it can also affect an individual's sense of identity. The natural hair ordinance is so important for people of color and passage of this law reflects Cincinnati\u2019s embrace of all members of its community.\"", "description": "Cincinnati is slated to become the next city to ban discrimination against natural hair.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/natural-hair-rf-gty-ml-190628_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
