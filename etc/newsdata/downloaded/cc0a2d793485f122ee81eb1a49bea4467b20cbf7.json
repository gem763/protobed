It could be that you\u2019re purposefully choosing worrying over relaxing According to a theory developed in 2011, people may intentionally make themselves anxious as a way to avoid the letdown they might get if something bad were to happen.\n\nAnxious all the time? You could be purposefully resisting relaxation. ~\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling the weight of the world and just don't know how to get on top of your anxiety, the answer may be simple, a new study by Penn researchers suggests.\n\nWhile relaxation techniques are great for the body and mind and usually help with stress management, they could have the opposite effect for some people.\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Affective Disorders, notes that people who are more sensitive to shifts in negative emotion \u2013 quickly moving from a relaxed state to a state of fear, for example \u2013 are more likely to feel anxious while being led through relaxation exercises.\n\nResisting relaxation and continuing worrying is likely because people may want to avoid a large jump in anxiety if something bad were to happen.\n\nThe causes of anxiety, or why some people are more susceptible than others, aren\u2019t clear, although genes are thought to be a factor. While it\u2019s normal for people to feel anxious, the anxiety can become extreme and lead to psychological symptoms such as feelings of losing control, fainting, or dying.\n\nThe study\n\nRelaxation-induced anxiety (RIA) is a phenomenon that occurs when people experience anxiety as a result of trying to relax, but Michelle Newman, professor of psychology, said the results can actually benefit people who experience this.\n\n\u201cPeople may be staying anxious to prevent a large shift in anxiety, but it\u2019s actually healthier to let yourself experience those shifts.\n\n\u201cThe more you do it, the more you realise you can do it,\u201d Newman said.\n\nThe researchers recruited 96 college students for the study. Participants included:\n\n32 people with generalised anxiety disorder\n\n34 people with major depressive disorder\n\n30 controls with neither disorder\n\nParticipants were led through two relaxation techniques and after analysing the data, it was found that those with generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) were more likely to be sensitive to sharp spikes in emotion, such as going from feeling relaxed to feeling scared or stressed. Those with major depressive disorder displayed similar results, although theirs were not as strong.\n\n\u2018Live in the moment\u2019\n\nInterventions such as mindfulness training can help people \u2018let go and live in the moment\u2019, added Newman.\n\nThe specific cause of RIA remains unknown, but Newman developed a theory back in 2011, explaining how the two concepts may be connected:\n\n\u201cThe theory revolves around the idea that people may make themselves anxious intentionally as a way to avoid the letdown they might get if something bad were to happen.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t actually helpful and just makes you more miserable. But, because most of the things we worry about don\u2019t end up happening, what\u2019s reinforced in the brain is, \u2018I worried and it didn\u2019t happen, so I should continue worrying,'\u201d explained Newman.\n\nHanjoo Kim, a graduate student in psychology, hopes the results may help clinicians provide better care for people suffering from anxiety.\n\n\u201cOur findings will hopefully serve as a cornerstone for providing better care for these populations.\n\n\u201cMeasuring relaxation-induced anxiety and implementing exposure techniques targeting the desensitisation of negative contrast sensitivity may help patients reduce this anxiety,\" Kim said.\n\nIt would also be important to look at relaxation-induced anxiety in other disorders, including panic disorder and persistent mild depression, Kim added.\n\nImage: iStock", "description": "According to a theory developed in 2011, people may intentionally make themselves anxious as a way to avoid the letdown they might get if something bad were to happen.", "authors": ["Zakiyah Ebrahim"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9447/fb829485aa6f4a7fa22f6f1ccbcd9a60.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
