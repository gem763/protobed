Football Outsiders' DVOA projections had the Raiders at 7.2 wins before the split with Brown; it'll be more difficult to hit that mark with Brown, one of the best receivers in the NFL, not playing for Oakland in 2019.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nRaiders were going to go 6-10 with Brown being targeted 175 times. Now that would be a success. Hope Hunter Renfrow is capable of going over the middle 20 times a game. \u2014 Dieter Kurtenbach (@dieter) September 7, 2019\n\nSo the Bears could've reasonably projected the 2020 second-round pick they got from Oakland in the Mack trade would be, at the very least, in the top 45. It's not unreasonable to think that selection will be a little higher now, at least in the first 40 picks, if not closer to the mid-30's if things really go off the rails before the Raiders move to Las Vegas.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso, in light of the Houston Texans' trade to acquire good-not-elite left tackle Laremy Tunsil, it feels even more incredible that Ryan Pace was able to snag a 2020 second-round pick in acquiring Mack last year. The Texans gave up two first-round picks - as the Bears did - as well as a second-rounder to acquire Tunsil (who they have not yet signed to a long-term extension). The highest pick the Texans got back from the Miami Dolphins was a 2020 fourth-rounder.\n\nAnyways, the Bears will have these picks in the 2020 NFL Draft:\n\nRound 2 (from Oakland)\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 6 (from Eagles - could be a fifth-rounder if Jordan Howard hits certain performance benchmarks)\n\nRound 6\n\nRound 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese picks will be hugely important if Pace is able to keep the Bears' Super Bowl window open with cheap, effective talent (of course, the most important thing: Good quarterback play). Perhaps the draft-aggressive Pace can identify a player he and Nagy like with that Raiders pick, then trade down with his other second-rounder to accumulate more mid-round selections.\n\nAnd it'll be a lot easier to do that if the Raiders pick is somewhere in the 30's.\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!\n\nCould Antonio Brown help the Bears get a higher draft pick in 2020? originally appeared on NBC Sports Chicago", "description": "The Oakland Raiders' second-round pick the Bears have in 2020's NFL Draft is looking a lot better after Antonio Brown was released Saturday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VMNe.yWfuaXaZNix62uA5A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD02ODIuNjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Ng--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/O6AIEz.2WoGwY0421PTnEQ--~B/aD0xMTc2O3c9MjIwNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnchicago.com/a23d501713fba50e8746177fb497bbb1", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
