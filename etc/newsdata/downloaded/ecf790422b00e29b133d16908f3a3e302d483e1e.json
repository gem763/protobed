(Julie Feldmeier/The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\nWhen people get shot and killed in D.C., the stories we hear about them often start with how their lives ended.\n\nMaybe they were standing in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nMaybe they were defending someone, or forcing someone else to do so.\n\nMaybe they were trying to turn their lives around and their pasts caught up to them.\n\nMaybe they were innocent. Maybe they were the antagonist. Maybe all they wanted was ice cream.\n\nNo matter why they were shot, their final moments are usually what we remember about them because that is what is talked about in the hours and days after their deaths by law enforcement officials, witnesses and relatives who are raw in their grief, trying to grasp how someone who occupied so much space in their lives yesterday won\u2019t be there to fill it tomorrow.\n\n\n\nSemaj Alsobrooks shown here at the age of 9 with his mom, Aniedrea Galloway. (Julie Feldmeier/The Washington Post)\n\nReporters across the country have become all-too-skilled at writing these stories and the public all-too-used to reading them.\n\nAnd yet, no matter how many gun violence deaths we catalogue in our minds in morbid shorthand \u2014 shot 17 times in a stairwell, struck by bullet while waiting at a traffic light, killed after going to McDonald\u2019s \u2014 nothing seems to change. Look at the District. After 10-year-old Makiyah Wilson was killed, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser declared \u201cEnough is enough\u201d \u2014 and yet, we are still standing in the same place we were then. Illegal guns are still too easy to get. Bullets are still scarring school walls. And people are still dying before they should.\n\n[\u2018What have we become:\u2019 Bryce Harper\u2019s win, a 10-year-old\u2019s murder and a city\u2019s contradictions]\n\nOn Wednesday, the city saw its 117th homicide of 2019. I\u2019m going to tell you about the man who claimed that spot, Semaj Alsobrooks, but this time, I want to try something different. I don\u2019t want to start at the end.\n\nI want to start with a moment in his life that was filled with hope and promise and a wrinkled shirt.\n\nI want to start with a photo of him when he was 9 years old.\n\nIn it, Semaj wears a white short-sleeve shirt with a collar. He stands in front of a wall, and he smiles with his mouth and eyes.\n\nThe picture was taken by Julie Feldmeier, who worked as an assistant to my fellow Washington Post columnist John Kelly.\n\nShe interviewed Alsobrooks and his mother, Aniedrea Galloway, for a column that ran June 28, 2006.\n\nThe piece detailed how Galloway paid off a $40,000 debt while raising two sons on her own and working toward a degree in early child development from the University of the District of Columbia. It described how, in an effort to give Semaj the best education possible, she drove him each day from their home in Southeast Washington to a school in Northwest.\n\nIt also asked readers to contribute money to help children like Semaj attend camp.\n\nHere are the first four paragraphs:\n\nIf this soon-to-be Moss Hollow camper becomes a star, my assistant, Julia Feldmeier, will be able to say she knew him when.\n\nSemaj Alsobrooks has long eyelashes. Very long, and very thick. The kind of lashes women covet, which is why, when his female classmates once pointed this out, he promptly cut those lashes.\n\nSemaj, 9, is no girlie-man. He\u2019s a tough kid \u2014 \u201cvery smart, but stubborn,\u201d says his mom, Aniedrea Galloway.\n\nAnd ambitious. He wants to be a rapper, a movie star or \u2014 cue the long lashes \u2014 a model. Pipe dreams for most, but his is a family that believes in the impossible.\n\nThe headline of the column: \u201cIn This Family, Dreams Become Reality.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Semaj\u2019s name again appeared in a Washington Post story. This time, under the headline, \u201cMan fatally shot, another wounded in Northeast Washington.\u201d\n\nI wish I could tell you how his life leaped from the first to the second headline. Or maybe it didn\u2019t leap. Maybe it crawled. Maybe it climbed and then fell.\n\nI tried to reach his relatives, in hope that they could fill in those years, but I did not hear back from them. A public records search and a look at social media posts about him hint at a complicated life. They show a man who has faced criminal charges but who also wore matching Christmas pajamas with his family, took trips with his mom and got married a year ago.\n\nThey show a 22-year-old with the same eyes as that 9-year-old who is described in that column as \u201cso Hollywood\u201d before these lines:\n\nHe looks up, lashes almost touching his brow, eyes twinkling. \u201cWanna be my agent?\u201d\n\nIt is hard to look at that old photo of Semaj and not see both what was lost and what could be. Every time I glance at it, I think about the 9-year-old black boys who are living right now in some of the District\u2019s roughest neighborhoods, and question what chances we have given them to survive and thrive.\n\n[Students said they felt unsafe going to and from school. Now, D.C. offers \u2018safe spots.\u2019]\n\nHow many illegal guns are in their neighborhoods? What pressure do they face to hold one, or aim one at someone?\n\nHow many are smiling, looking as if they are standing on promising ground, and will later end up in a police news release?\n\n\u201cUntil all life is clearly valued, no life is really valuable,\u201d David Bowers, the founder of a group called No Murders D.C. says when I call him to talk about Semaj. Black males are disproportionately the victims and the perpetrators of gun violence in the District, he points out, and that won\u2019t change until the solutions and interventions are \u201cvisible,\u201d \u201cwell funded,\u201d \u201cwell supported\u201d and \u201clong term.\u201d\n\nCity officials and citizens both have to make that a priority, he says. \u201cEveryone ought to be thinking, \u2018What is my part to play to make sure not one life is lost?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe alternative, of course, is we could just keep piling up endings.\n\nD.C. police have not released much information about the shooting, but the incident report provides some details about what officers saw when they arrived on East Capitol Street just before midnight. They discovered two people had been shot. One man was taken to a hospital and admitted in stable condition. Semaj was found on the roadway, not breathing.\n\n\u201cAfter lifesaving efforts proved futile,\u201d the report reads, he was pronounced dead an 12:42 a.m.\n\nLying on a road, shot and unconscious. That\u2019s how Semaj\u2019s story ends.", "description": "With gun violence victims, we too often remember only their final moments.", "authors": ["Theresa Vargas", "Local Columnist Who Previously Wrote For The Local Enterprise Team About Poverty", "Race", "People With Disabilities.", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/cZGyhEsi-kpKgK909snddTb_QcA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TDGC55WQ4EI6TB72QUA2IVWAAM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
