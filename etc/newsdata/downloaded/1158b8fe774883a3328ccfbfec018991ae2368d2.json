For two months they\u2019ve been bailing out of mutual funds and ETFs, taking cover from what has been a stomach-wrenching stretch of volatility and uncertainty about the stability of the global economy.\n\nThe fact remains, however, that emerging market stocks continue to be an important asset class for investors who want to maintain a diversified long-term portfolio. That\u2019s investing 101. But how should investors reconcile that basic lesson with their impulse to flee and wait for calmer times?\n\nRather than closing out emerging markets in your portfolio, consider trimming exposure somewhat\u2014there\u2019s good reason to keep a foot in the door, says James Donald, head of emerging markets for Lazard Asset Management in New York.\n\n\u201cIn emerging markets, you have 20% to 30% discounts in stock price-to-earnings valuations compared to developed markets, and profitability that is not far away from developed markets,\u201d Donald says. \u201cIt is complicated, no question, but we think it\u2019s a relatively attractive time to be in emerging markets.\u201d\n\nThink Long Term\n\nEmerging markets stocks started out strong this year, posting double-digit increases through April. But that\u2019s when trade tensions flared up between the U.S. and China, threatening to slow world economic growth, and markets began gyrating wildly and losing ground.\n\nEmerging markets are particularly sensitive to trade tensions because they are highly dependent on growth in the world economy. \u201cEmerging markets tend to do well when trade is expanding,\u201d Donald says. \u201cAnd investors are anxious that trade will not be expanding\u2014that it will be contracting.\u201d\n\nAnd there are other uncertainties, such as the strength of the U.S. dollar, which was already putting strain on emerging markets heading into the trade war. Emerging markets generally don\u2019t do well when the dollar is strong. While the dollar has eased somewhat, it\u2019s uncertain how big a factor it will be in the months ahead, Donald says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit hard to tell because half the time [President Donald] Trump is talking about how great the U.S. economy is and how strong the dollar is, and half the time he seems to want to depress the value of the dollar,\u201d Donald says.\n\nWhile it\u2019s easy to get elbow-deep in all of the factors impacting the market in the short term, investors shouldn\u2019t lose sight of the fact that emerging markets play an important role in a long-term diversified portfolio.\n\nWhile the asset class has been underperforming for almost a decade, \u201cif you look at history, you don\u2019t have constant underperformance. You have periods of underperformance followed by periods of outperformance,\u201d Donald says.\n\n\u201cTwenty years ago, people were extremely gloomy about emerging markets and a lot of people said, \u2018This is where you have a lot of volatility and no return,\u2019\u201d Donald says. \u201cThe next 10 years was a period where you got much better returns.\u201d\n\nAssuming the U.S. and China can settle a comprehensive trade deal, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all if we\u2019re not far from a period where emerging markets start becoming an outperforming asset class.\u201d\n\nAvoid Trouble Spots\n\nIn the meantime, select stock picking is important, both geographically and across sectors. There are a number of trouble spots best avoided, Donald says.\n\nFor example, last week, just weeks before a general election, Standard & Poor\u2019s slashed Argentina\u2019s long-term credit rating by three notches, pushing the country further toward a financial crisis. South Africa\u2019s economy has yet to regain firm footing under President Cyril Ramaphosa, who took office in February last year. And Mexico \u201cis a bit of a concern,\u201d Donald says, citing uncertainties about the country\u2019s new president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.\n\nOn the positive side, however, there are a number of countries that inspire confidence, including India and Indonesia, where there are signs of infrastructure investments not unlike China\u2019s some 20 to 25 years ago. And Eastern European countries have seen banking industry growth and credit growth, Donald says.\n\nBroadly speaking, the most successful sector in emerging markets lately has been internet-related technology companies based in China, Korea, and Taiwan, while there\u2019s also been some strong performance in consumer staples and healthcare stocks, Donald says.\n\nThese areas tend to have high valuations, while the more economically sensitive sectors such as financials, industrials, and energy are quite cheap.\n\n\u201cIf the world economy stabilizes and we avoid global recession, there\u2019s reason to believe some more economically sensitive areas that are depressed could do significantly better,\u201d Donald says. \u201cThe financial position of a lot of these companies is pretty good\u2014we\u2019ve seen quite an improvement in balance sheets as a result of companies making profits and paying dividends.\u201d\n\nWhile the three sectors\u2014financials, industrials and energy\u2014are the ones to watch, \u201cwe look at things very much stock by stock\u2014it\u2019s a bit like finding a needle in a haystack,\u201d Donald says.\n\nExtreme volatility is likely to continue in emerging markets for some time. The key is to keep a long term view and remember that the asset class can also perform very differently than the U.S. and developed markets when current scenarios are flipped\u2014when today\u2019s stronger markets weaken, emerging markets could be the asset class that buoys your portfolio\u2019s performance.", "description": "Lazard Asset Management\u2019s James Donald on why it\u2019s important to keep a foot in the door, even in turbulent times", "authors": ["Karen Hube"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-103554/social"}
