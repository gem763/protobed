Every driver is different. Some are smart and aggressive and some are silly with it.\n\n\u2018From experience of racing with them you give them more space while with others you don\u2019t need to. If you come together with Max, you give him extra space. He\u2019s a magnet for those kinds of things.\n\n\u2018At some point I thought I\u2019d get torpedoed by him.\u2019 Sebastian Vettel, who finished second in Mexico, agreed with Hamilton, saying: \u2018Just copy and paste, it\u2019s true.\u2019 Hamilton and Verstappen went wheel to wheel on the first lap, with Verstappen forcing the Brit on to the grass to avoid serious damage.\n\nVerstappen later clashed with Bottas, puncturing one of his own tires before fighting his way back to finish sixth.\n\nThe scrap for the title now goes to Austin, Texas, this Sunday with Hamilton only needing to come eighth to be certain of claiming his sixth championship success over his remaining nominal rival, Bottas.\n\nMade the most of my race after an initial setback. Considering the circumstances it was still a good race. This just wasn\u2019t our weekend, but we will bounce back in USA #KeepPushing #MexicoGP \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddfd pic.twitter.com/UR6mFtpYy7 \u2014 Max Verstappen (@Max33Verstappen) October 27, 2019\n\nHamilton won the Mexican Grand Prix on Sunday but will have to wait to confirm his six title", "description": "JONATHAN MCEVOY IN MEXICO CITY: Max Verstappen has been singled out as Formula One's 'silly' dangerman after his gung-ho approach in last weekend's Mexican Grand Prix.", "authors": ["Jonathan Mcevoy For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/16/20288524-0-image-a-28_1572281619019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
