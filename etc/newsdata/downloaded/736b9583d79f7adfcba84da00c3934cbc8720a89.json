He still owes us 20 000 RMB (about R42 000). Bring it to us, or you\u2019ll never see him again,\u201d the text message read.\n\nMs Huang said she was concerned about her husband\u2019s wellbeing but didn\u2019t immediately pay the ransom, believing it could be a scam.\n\nIn screenshots of the conversation, the distressed wife asks: \u201cLet me see him and I\u2019ll pay you. If I can\u2019t see him, how do I know whether he\u2019s dead or alive?\u201d\n\nShe waited two full days until more messages arrived, this time accompanied by images appearing to show Mr Huang\u2019s hands and feet bound, and his mouth gagged.\n\nBut after intensive investigating, authorities found that the man\u2019s kidnapping was a hoax and he had, in fact, stayed at a hotel when he was supposedly kidnapped.\n\n\n\nCCTV images also showed the man walking freely and not being held against his will.\n\nWhen police finally tracked Mr Haung down, he confessed to deceiving his wife so she\u2019d send him money to pay off debt.\n\nThe man was sentenced to 10 days in prison and fined 500 RMB (about R1 000) for a public order offense.\n\nSource: Magazine Features", "description": "A man sent heart-rending images of himself after he faked his own kidnapping.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9437/da4e97a347f94675a5094015c8646aba.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
