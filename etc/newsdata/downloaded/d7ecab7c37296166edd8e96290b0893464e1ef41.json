Much of this work is physically taxing, and has further-reaching impacts as well, taking a toll on relationships and, in the case of child care, women\u2019s earning potential.\n\nMost men have not been sent the message\u2014by their parents, by their peers, by society\u2014that housework is their responsibility. That\u2019s a possible explanation for why, even though American men have a half hour more free time each day than American women, they still do less housework.\n\nMany women are consistently frustrated by how the burden of housework gets divvied up. \u201cIt\u2019s always me asking him and him somehow doing me a \u2018favor\u2019 by agreeing to do this for me. Not for him, not for the house\u2014for me,\u201d says Shay Raviv, a 30-year-old design researcher in the Netherlands. \u201cHe says, \u2018You\u2019re always telling me what to do,\u2019 and then I say, \u2018But if I don\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t get done.\u2019 I\u2019m tired of it.\u201d Indeed, all of the (straight) women I interviewed for this article said that their partners didn\u2019t seem to notice or mind as much as they did when their home was unclean or untidy; the women therefore took the lead on domestic work, while their partners needed to be cajoled into doing it. A wage like the one my husband paid me could be one way to avoid that dynamic.\n\nThe idea that domestic work should be compensated has historical precedent: In 1898, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, an American writer and feminist, wrote Women and Economics, arguing that caregiving should be done by paid specialists (both men and women), to make it accessible to everyone, rather than only those with a mother or wife at their disposal.\n\nAlmost a century later, in the 1970s, an Italian movement called Wages for Housework made its way to the United States. The movement petitioned the government to pay women for domestic work, arguing that it was central to the economy: How, without mothers and wives, would male workers make it out of the house, fed and ready for work?\n\nOf course, the government was unmoved, and Wages for Housework eventually fizzled out. If any countries had adopted its proposal, their economies would look a lot different. For instance, the British government estimated that its residents performed \u00a31.24 trillion worth of domestic work in 2016\u2014roughly 63 percent of the United Kingdom\u2019s GDP that year.\n\nInstead, the idea of paying women for housework was overshadowed by a brand of feminism that urged women to seek liberation in work outside the home. These modern-day feminists might point out that a salary for housework risks further cementing it as \u201cwomen\u2019s work,\u201d and even obliging them to do more of it.\n\nThere are more practical concerns as well. Most notably: Who would pay? I happened to live with a partner who could afford to pay me for five or so hours a week. But this is a luxury, and not one that could likely become policy.", "description": "We wanted to address a systemic, gendered imbalance.
