Delta will also invest $350 million to help the Santiago-based airline unwind ties with American\u2019s Oneworld alliance. Chile\u2019s Supreme Court blocked the country from inclusion in Latam\u2019s proposed venture with American in May.\n\nDelta\u2019s agreement furthers the carrier\u2019s ambitions to expand internationally by buying pieces of foreign airlines, adding Latam to a list of partners that includes Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd., Air France-KLM and Korean Air Lines Co. Delta also owns a large stake in Grupo Aeromexico SAB, so the tie-up with Latam will fill out its network throughout Latin America.\n\n\u201cThe deal is likely to turn Delta into the largest U.S. airline to the region,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst George Ferguson said in a report. \u201cA strong balance sheet and cash flow allows Delta to draw a key American Airlines partner into an alliance, even as it supports Latam\u2019s stock price by buying at almost an 80% premium.\u201d\n\nFor American, which is currently the largest U.S. carrier on Latin American routes, the \u201closs of its Latam partnership to Delta is a significant blow that likely leads to dramatically reduced share in a vital market,\u201d Ferguson said.\n\nDelta will exit its 9% stake in Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA, a Brazilian carrier. Gol\u2019s American depositary receipts tumbled 9.4% to $14.90 after the close of regular trading in New York. Latam\u2019s ADRs surged 47% $13.23. Delta was little changed.\n\nThe Delta flight-sharing agreement accounts for only 0.3% of Gol\u2019s total revenue, a spokesman for the Brazilian company wrote in an email. The two airlines will honor all tickets acquired through the agreement, he said.\n\nGrowth Opportunities\n\nDelta and Latam will pursue a joint-business arrangement covering Brazil, the region\u2019s top travel market, and three countries that have open skies agreements with the U.S.: Chile, Colombia and Peru. Argentina would eventually be included if a pending open-skies deal with the U.S. is approved, the Atlanta-based airline said.\n\n\u201cWe immediately saw a lot of opportunities together for growth,\u201d Delta Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said in an interview. \u201cThis is a big change for Latam as they unplug from American and Oneworld.\u201d\n\nAmerican attributed Latam\u2019s decision to the court ruling. Chile\u2019s National Economic Prosecutor had filed a petition to block Latam\u2019s joint business deal with American on the grounds that it affected competition. Chile\u2019s tour operators association, Achet, had alleged that the agreements were effectively price collusion.\n\n\u2018Negative Ruling\u2019\n\n\u201cGiven the recent negative ruling by the Chilean Supreme Court, which would have significantly reduced the benefits of our partnership since Chile was not approved as a part of the potential joint business arrangement, we understand Latam\u2019s decision to partner with a U.S. carrier that isn\u2019t burdened by the ruling,\u201d American said in a statement.\n\nIn April, American and Latam began seeking regulatory approvals for a deal that would allow them to jointly market and operate flights between the U.S. and six South American countries. The Fort Worth, Texas-based company said the end of its plans with Latam wouldn\u2019t have a major financial impact.\n\nDelta\u2019s talks with Latam began with \u201ca third-party introduction,\u201d Bastian said. Delta will buy its stake in Latam through a public tender offer at $16 a share, funded mainly with newly issued debt and available cash. Brazil is Latam\u2019s largest market, accounting for 30% of the company\u2019s overall business, Bastian said.\n\nA350 Jets\n\nAs part of the deal, Delta will acquire four Airbus SE A350 jetliners in Latam\u2019s long-haul fleet, plus 10 more scheduled for delivery through 2025. Latam will keep flying eight A350s already in its fleet.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been considering our options to grow that fleet as well and so this is an opportunity for us to grow the fleet sooner than we were anticipating,\u201d Bastian said.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Delta Air Lines Inc. is dramatically expanding its South American footprint, agreeing to a $2.25 billion deal with Latam Airlines Group SA after a similar arrangement between the Chilean company and American Airlines Group Inc. ran into legal trouble.The pact calls for Delta to pay $1.9", "authors": ["Justin Bachman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Kc2HnC8HZdsyYJGwx2hNcA--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MTk5OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/2e8b1ddedd3955ca016024f59e009dcd", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
