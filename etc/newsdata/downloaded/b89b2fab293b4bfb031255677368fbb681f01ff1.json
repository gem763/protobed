(Mark Wilson/Getty Images)\n\nHispanic Heritage Month, from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15, should be an important moment to reflect upon the history and experiences of Latinos and Latin Americans in the United States, and to explore the wide-ranging nature of Latino communities past and present. When the annual celebration was conceived in 1968, it was meant to draw attention to the needs of Hispanic communities, to honor the long history of Hispanics in the United States, and to strengthen ties between the United States and the Latin American countries from which many Hispanics or their families had emigrated.\n\nBut over the years, the season has more often served as a month-long opportunity for politicians, many university leaders and corporate executives to wax blas\u00e9 about diversity and multiculturalism in ways that allow them to return to business as usual for the remaining 11 months of the year.\n\nThis year President Trump followed a well-established script \u2014 offering praise for the \u201coutstanding men and women of Hispanic heritage who ha[ve] excelled in every dimension of American society, and helped to build our community into the greatest nation the world has ever seen.\u201d He drew attention to the Hispanics who \u201cbravely serve in our Armed Forces\u201d while criticizing immigrant \u201cgang members\u201d and \u201cbad hombres.\u201d\n\nWhile historians have made great strides since 1968 in documenting and analyzing the most complex aspects of the Latino past, Democrats and Republicans still too often spout cliches about Hispanics\u2019 honor, patriotism, traditional family values, religious devotion and work ethic. Presidents have long offered grand pronouncements that acknowledge the military service of Hispanics in World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War and every war since. The current administration is not alone in offering dull hagiographies, Pan American snacks and paeans to Hispanic \u201cservice\u201d to the nation.\n\nThis emphasis on Hispanic service is nothing short of bad history. Of course, Hispanics have enrolled in the military and Border Patrol in very high numbers; they have given their lives in wars and foreign conflicts; they have led countless businesses and labor unions; they have voted and served as elected officials for more than 200 years; and they\u2019ve shaped schools and key American institutions since the 19th century.\n\nBut \u201cservice\u201d suggests Hispanic subservience and deference, not leadership or creativity. The truth is that Latinos have not simply served the United States. They have animated, expanded, shaped and reimagined the nation and the world. Their histories have been varied, sometimes contradictory, and often hard to categorize. Latinos have been patriots and anarchists, anti-racists and bigots, labor unionists and corporate executives, militarists and pacifists, Democrats and Republicans, and everything in between. Hispanic Heritage Month is over 50 years old and is mature enough to handle some complexity.\n\nTo begin honoring the Hispanic heritage of the United States, then, is to recognize these complex histories and to pull back from empty statements like, \u201cWe Love Our Hispanics.\u201d It\u2019s nice to be celebrated, but it would be even better to spend energy wrestling with the contradictory histories that more than anything else make us Americans, and not only during this month.\n\nHispanic Heritage Month has become a spectacle of electoral politics, corporate marketing, and academic promotions of diversity and inclusion, but it wasn\u2019t always this way. To understand the transformation in the meaning and practice of Hispanic Heritage Month, we need to understand the history of the celebration itself, and the histories of the Latino and immigrant communities that had demanded recognition a century before the celebration\u2019s inauguration.\n\nBeginning in the 19th century, native-born and immigrant communities with ties to Latin America pushed for greater representation of their histories in schools, newspapers, holidays, parades and other venues. New Yorkers, Texans and Californians connected their civil rights struggles and community building to representations of the past. They demanded a more accurate accounting of American history, one that acknowledged members of different Hispanic communities as central actors, how Hispanic and indigenous peoples had lived in the United States for centuries before northern Europeans arrived and how the history of their communities in the United States depended on the imperial expansions of Spain and the United States in Latin America.\n\nLocal and state representatives learned that it was important to show up to community celebrations if they wanted to secure Latino support. By the 1960s, national politicians eager to swing the \u201cHispanic vote\u201d appealed to those communities\u2019 sense of history by delivering speeches and appearing for photo ops at community parades and on the national holidays of the United States and various Latin American countries.\n\nThe Hispanic population was growing, and more Hispanics were attending college, running for office, starting businesses and becoming middle-class consumers. Companies and businesses discovered that marketing to the Hispanic community could bring in the big bucks. Hispanics (and politicians and businesses and universities) came to believe that these constituents and clients could no longer be ignored.\n\nFollowing the introduction of resolutions by congressmen from states where the majority of Hispanics lived \u2014 only one of those lawmakers, Rep. Edward Roybal of California, was Hispanic \u2014 President Lyndon B. Johnson inaugurated Hispanic Heritage Week, largely as a response to criticism from Hispanics that he had not fulfilled his 1964 campaign promises to them.\n\nThereafter, presidents Richard M. Nixon, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter signed proclamations every September, designating the week that included Sept. 15 and Sept. 16 \u2014 the anniversaries of the independence from Spain of several Latin American countries \u2014 as Hispanic Heritage Week. President Ronald Reagan then outdid his predecessors, extending the commemoration from a week to a month in 1988.\n\nIn their presidential speeches during Hispanic Heritage Month, George H.W. Bush celebrated Latinos\u2019 commitment to \u201cfaith and family, hard work and individual responsibility,\u201d while Bill Clinton noted how \u201cthe traditions that Americans hold so dear\u201d align with \u201cHispanic American values.\u201d Barack Obama emphasized that Latinos \u201cshow the same grit and determination that have carried us forward for centuries.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s recent pronouncements about Hispanics\u2019 \u201cdrive,\u201d \u201cfaith\u201d and \u201ccontributions,\u201d like his trite praise of Hall of Fame pitcher Mariano Rivera and Hispanic Border Patrol agents, simply echo old cliches. His tributes are even less likely than those of previous presidents to win him support from Latinos. Just days after the White House\u2019s Hispanic Heritage Month event, after all, we learned that this president had suggested shooting unwanted border-crossers from Latin America.\n\nOur elected officials, and not only Trump, can do more than eat taco bowls and speak of their love for Hispanic culture. Instead, they can celebrate the work of community leaders and of smart public historians and museum curators who have long told important truths about America\u2019s past. They can consider how Hispanic Heritage events relate to Latin America\u2019s many independence holidays in September and October, in which communities in the United States celebrate their families\u2019 national origins \u2014 just as we do every July 4 \u2014 and not just \u201cbeing Hispanic.\u201d\n\nThey can read a history book or two. They can invite debate about the tensions and synergies between Hispanic Heritage Month programs and the ways that we discuss Oct. 14, intended to bookend the month as both Columbus Day and indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day. They can teach histories that foreground Afro-Latino communities and force difficult reckonings with hemispheric racism.\n\nWe need more than platitudes about Hispanic contributions and values. We need to recognize that Latino history is American history and that the history we tell matters for how we engage one another in the present.", "description": "The season has more often served as a month-long opportunity for politicians, university leaders, and corporate executives to wax blas\u00e9 about diversity and multiculturalism, while returning to business as usual for the remaining eleven months of the year.", "authors": ["Geraldo Cadava", "Stephen Pitti", "October At Am", "Geraldo Cadava Is Writing A Book About The History Of Conservatism Among Hispanics", "Forthcoming In Ecco.", "Stephen Pitti Is A Professor Of History", "American Studies At Yale University", "Where He Directs The Center For The Study Of Race", "Indigeneity", "Transnational Migration."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/s77ZnlUT4zvzWYWu1xwwrvhz5zY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/44BUKPHBQUI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
