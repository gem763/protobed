The Lions lost because they couldn\u2019t stop Dalvin Cook, Stefon Diggs, Kirk Cousins and the rest of the Minnesota offense. The Vikings rolled up 503 yards in their 42-30 victory Sunday, handing Detroit its third straight loss.\n\nThe Lions were on the wrong end of some questionable calls late in their 23-22 loss at Green Bay on Monday night. Their fans came ready to vent their frustration against Minnesota, but quarterback Matthew Stafford said that reaction didn\u2019t affect the players much.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have any effect on me, I don\u2019t think it does on the guys on our team,\u201d Stafford said. \u201cYou can ask the refs if it affects them, I don\u2019t know, but I think they\u2019re pretty used to it, probably, too. We\u2019ve just got to go play the game. I understand people are upset at certain times for whatever reason, but for us, what we can control is scoring, not letting them score - and we didn\u2019t do a good enough job of that today.\u201d\n\nStafford become the fastest quarterback to reach 40,000 yards passing, eclipsing the mark in his 147th game. He threw four touchdown passes, all to Marvin Jones, but the Lions allowed easily their highest point total of the season.\n\nCook ran for 142 yards, and Cousins threw for 337 and four touchdowns. A 66-yard pass to Diggs set up a late insurance touchdown that helped seal the victory.\n\nDetroit was unbeaten through three games before this current losing streak. The Lions lost a close game at home to Kansas City - no shame in that - and then fell on the road in controversial fashion to the Packers. In this game, they were simply outplayed.\n\nThe defense in particular had problems. Cousins wasn\u2019t sacked a single time, and Cook was terrific.\n\nDetroit defensive end Trey Flowers was asked if he thought the Lions would play angrier, given the nature of their loss to Green Bay.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really stand on emotions. You stand on fundamentals and hard work,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, whether emotions were high or low today, it all goes back to the fundamentals that you prepare with. It all goes back to the technique and things like that. It\u2019s just one of those deals that whatever happened last week, you can\u2019t let it carry over to today, whether that\u2019s anger or sorrow.\u201d\n\nThe Lions were feisty at the end, when there was some pushing and shoving as Minnesota tried to kneel out the clock, but by then it was much too late. If Detroit tried at all to use the loss to the Packers as fuel, it didn\u2019t seem to matter much.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the frustration or really the emotion of playing the game is ever wiped out. I think the emotion gets carried through this game from year to year, play to play, week to week, decade to decade, if you\u2019re in it that long,\u201d Lions coach Matt Patricia said. \u201cBut from a rally cry or anything like that, you just want to make sure that you\u2019re not focusing on or paying too much attention to the wrong thing.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Noah Trister at https://twitter.com/noahtrister\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The fans in Detroit booed the officials during the opening coin toss, then again when the game's first flag was thrown.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Noah Trister"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
