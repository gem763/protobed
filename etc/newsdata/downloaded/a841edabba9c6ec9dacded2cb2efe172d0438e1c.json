There were only partial operations during the weekend and limited services through the start of the week.\n\nThe widening political sensitivities involved have been highlighted by a growing row after an executive of the U.S. National Basketball Association (NBA) team the Houston Rockets backed the protests.\n\nOne-time U.S. presidential candidate and former First Lady Hillary Clinton and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver have both since weighed in to the controversy, drawing the ire of Chinese state media.\n\nClinton said on her official Twitter account on Wednesday: \"Every American has the right to voice their support for democracy and human rights for Hong Kong. Full stop.\"\n\nSilver spoke up for freedom of speech, saying it was not up to the NBA to regulate what players, employees and team owners said. Chinese state media responded on Wednesday by accusing the NBA of endorsing violence and peddling a \"secessionist pipe dream\".
