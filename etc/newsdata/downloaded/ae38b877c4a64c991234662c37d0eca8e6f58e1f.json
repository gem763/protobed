Hello Bello\n\nIt's not uncommon for people who have trouble falling asleep to take melatonin supplements. Research has shown that they may help promote sleep.\n\nIn addition to melatonin, Hello Bello Sleep Well gummies have three other key ingredients (chamomile, lemon balm, and passionflower), which many doctors recommend as natural sleep remedies.\n\nnatural sleep remedies. I tired the Sleep Well gummies and found that they helped me fall asleep in half my usual time and without the huge wave of exhaustion I experience with drugstore melatonin.\n\nExperiencing that instant comatose state as soon as my head hits the pillow is sadly something I've rarely experienced. Falling asleep has always been difficult for me.\n\nSome might blame it on bad habits, like treating my bed like a couch to lounge on during the day or scrolling through my phone as I lie in bed. Whatever the reason may be, I've spent as much as two hours fighting to enter dreamland.\n\nOn average, it takes me about an hour and a half to fall asleep once I crawl into bed (which usually isn't until 11 p.m.). After working all day, exercising in the evening, eating dinner, and prepping for the next day, I feel the need to unwind before I go to sleep. For me, that means mindlessly scrolling through my phone while in bed. I know this is a bad habit, especially for those who struggle with insomnia, so I do try to limit myself. But even after I put my phone down, I'm still left tossing and turning as the minutes tick by and sleep eludes me.\n\nAbout a month ago, I saw a bright yellow Hello Bello box on the Insider Picks' product table. Inside were 10 colorful bottles of vitamin gummies. I scanned each bottle until my eyes stopped on the words \"Sleep Well.\" Hmm, that's something I haven't done in the past couple of weeks, I thought to myself. So I grabbed the bottle and figured I would give the Hello Bello Sleep Well gummies a try.\n\nWhat are they?\n\nSleep Well gummies are formulated with four main ingredients: melatonin, chamomile, lemon balm, and passionflower, all of which are considered natural sleep aids. When taken properly, they may help you fall asleep and rest better through the night. The star ingredient here is melatonin, which is a hormone produced by our bodies that helps sync our internal clocks with the beginning and end of the day. Research has shown that taking melatonin supplements may help promote sleep. Ideally, our bodies will produce enough of it to help us drift off at night and stay asleep, but sometimes sleep disorders, stress, jet lag, you name it, can get in the way of achieving the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep. While the other three main ingredients (chamomile, lemon balm, and passionflower) aren't clinically proven to treat insomnia, they're the same ingredients found in popular nighttime sleep teas. Many doctors recommend them as natural sleep remedies as well. The gummies themselves are vegan and do not contain artificial colors or flavors; common allergens like wheat, gluten, eggs, and peanuts; or high fructose corn syrup. Each bottle contains 75 gummies or 37.5 doses (two gummies per dose).

They taste just like fruit snacks, so if you have small children in your home, definitely keep these on the top shelf.\n\nThe packaging says one dose consists of two gummies, but it doesn't mention when they should be taken. I reached out to the company for a suggested time frame, and they recommended taking two gummies a half-hour before bed.\n\nWith that in mind, I took my dose and went about my usual routine of packing my next day's lunch and washing up. Coincidentally, I finished up about 30 minutes later and found that the Hello Bello Sleep Well gummies had already started to kick in. My eyes felt heavy, and my mind was focused on sleep rather than the million and one things I'd done that day.\n\nAs I grabbed my phone to do my usual social media sweep, I realized I didn't actually feel the need to mindlessly scroll. I did it anyway out of pure habit, but after 15 minutes, I was actually nodding off with my phone in my hand. All in all, the amount of time that passed from when I took the Sleep Well gummies until I fell asleep was about 45 minutes \u2014 and before midnight no less.\n\nI've taken over-the-counter melatonin supplements before, and they worked for me. But after taking them, I was always smacked by a wave of extreme exhaustion that forced me to sleep. The Sleep Well gummies didn't produce this effect, and I speculate the added botanicals may make the difference here. Once the gummies started to work, I felt more relaxed and able to decompress before a wave of drowsiness slowly came over me. It was a much more calming experience, and I got a good night's sleep.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nI don't take the Sleep Well gummies every night because I don't want to rely on a sleep aid (though you're unlikely to become dependent on melatonin). I do use them from time to time though. If I have to get up earlier than normal the next day, I'll take the recommended dose 30 minutes before bed to ensure I can get a solid seven hours of sleep. I have also taken them after a long, busy day to unwind before bed.\n\nIf you're someone who has trouble sleeping and needs help every once in a while, the Hello Bello Sleep Well gummies are a great product to try.
