I was in bed for three days.\n\n\u2018I believed I had the flu and I was treating myself with over the counter medication. I suffered all of the symptoms of TSS but I confused it for the flu \u2013 nausea and diarrhoea, dizziness, achey muscles.\n\nA vaginal swab led to the discovery of toxic shock syndrome and septic shock as a result (Picture: Greta Zarate /SWNS.COM)\n\n\u2018The only thing I didn\u2019t get was a rash which is often a symptom of it.\n\n\u2018But I was getting sicker and sicker. My fever was so high, I was shaky and weak.\n\n\u2018I was scared and extremely ill. I had a serious pain in my side because my spleen was swollen from trying to fight the infection.\n\n\u2018The only doctors they hadn\u2019t consulted was gynaecology and it was a blessing that one of the nurses thought that it might be toxic shock because I had my period. She put two and two together.\n\n\u2018They discovered it was a staph infection in my blood after taking a vaginal swab and it stemmed from microscopic cuts in my vagina from a tampon.\u2019\n\nGreta was admitted to Onslow Memorial Hospital in Jacksonville on February 3 this year, where a line was inserted into her chest to administer antibiotics, fluids and morphine to fight the infection and manage her pain.\n\nGreta spent 11 days in hospital and needed a blood transfusion (Picture: Greta Zarate /SWNS.COM)\n\nShe underwent a blood transfusion to help restore her body\u2019s red blood cells and to prevent the further spread of the infection throughout her bloodstream.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGreta was told that if she had waited another day to go to hospital, she could have lost a limb \u2013 or her life.\n\nThe mum wants to share her story because many people believe toxic shock syndrome is only caused by leaving a tampon in for too long \u2013 when in fact using \u2018super\u2019 tampons when they\u2019re not necessary can allow bacteria to enter the body through microscopic abrasions.\n\nGreta said: \u2018There\u2019s a misconception about toxic shock syndrome and tampons.. There\u2019s an idea that a tampon that\u2019s been inside you for a long period of time causes this.\n\n\u2018I never knew that the size of the tampon should move with your flow. Like super tampons should only be for really heavy days, regular for normal days, and light for the end of your flow.\n\n\u2018When you pull a dry tampon out of your body, it actually leaves tiny scrapes on your vaginal wall which allow bacteria to enter your bloodstream and that\u2019s what happened to me.\n\n\u2018I change my tampon every time I use the bathroom, so I knew it wasn\u2019t because I had left it in there for a long, long time.\u2019\n\nGreta has made a full recovery but no longer uses tampons.\n\nHer brush with death prompted her to undergo a genetic test for the BRCA2 gene, which increases a woman\u2019s risk of developing ovarian and breast cancer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGreta said: \u2018My sister was 26 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer and I always planned to get the test but life got in the way.\n\n\u2018I have my blood tested regularly now to make sure I don\u2019t get sick again and my doctor asked if I might want to take the test so I did.\n\n\u2018I do have the gene so now I am preparing for preventative surgeries.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m having a hysterectomy at the end of the year and a mastectomy in February.\n\n\u2018Going through toxic shock made everything clearer for me.\n\n\u2018I want to be around for my children for a long time. These preventative surgeries will reduce my risk of developing cancer and that\u2019s my main priority.\u2019\n\nWhat is Toxic Shock Syndrome? TSS (Toxic Shock Syndrome) is very rare condition caused by toxins getting into the blood stream and releasing dangerous toxins. It can affect anyone of any age but is most frequently associated with tampon use in young women. It can be fatal but it caught early it is treatable with antibiotics. The causes of TSS TSS is caused by bacteria called Staphylococcus. It usually lives harmlessly on the surface of the skin and but if it gets into the blood stream it can release toxins that can disturb the function of vital organs. How to prevent TSS According to the NHS:\n\n\u2013 choose a tampon with the lowest absorbency suitable for your menstrual flow\n\n\u2013 swap tampons for a sanitary towel or panty liner during your period\n\n\u2013 wash your hands before and after inserting a tampon\n\n\u2013 change tampons regularly never insert more than one tampon at a time\n\n\u2013 insert a new tampon first thing before going to bed and change it first thing in the morning\n\nMORE: This seven-year-old year old rapper is killing the game\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Not my cup of pee: Civil servant fired for urinating in kettle\n\nMORE: The 2020 Michelin guide: 7 newly-starred restaurants to try in the UK\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Greta Zarate was rushed to hospital following flu-like symptoms while she was on her period.", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_89092145_1570686186.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
