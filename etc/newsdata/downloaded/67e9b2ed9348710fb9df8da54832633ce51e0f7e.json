LOUIS (AP) - Dakota Hudson is a big fan of Marcell Ozuna\u2019s arm.\n\nOzuna drove in four runs and threw out a runner at home plate from left field, leading the St. Louis Cardinals over the Washington Nationals 4-2 on Monday night.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the second one he\u2019s had for me this year,\u201d Hudson said of Ozuna\u2019s assist to the plate. \u201cHe\u2019s looking really good. He threw a perfect one in there to save a run.\u201d\n\nSt. Louis maintained a two-game NL Central lead over the second-place Chicago Cubs, who closed within a half-game of the Nationals for the top NL wild card\n\nNationals manager Dave Martinez missed the game following a heart procedure in Washington, and bench coach Chip Hale was in charge of the dugout.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll give us a call after the game if he\u2019s up,\u201d Hale said. \u201cI know he\u2019s been through a battery of tests. Hopefully he\u2019s feeling good.\u201d\n\nOzuna hit a two-run homer in the first off Stephen Strasburg, who walked Dexter Fowler leading off.\n\n\u201cI was in the same division as him and I faced him a lot,\u201d Ozuna said. \u201cI know this guy. I know what I can handle to get a good at-bat.\u201d\n\nOzuna has faced Strasburg 41 times and has 12 hits, including three home runs and six RBIs.\n\n\u201cI figured based on his numbers that Ozuna would have a good night, but I feel that way every night about him,\u201d St. Louis manager Mike Shildt said. \u201cIt was a nice, nice job by him all the way around tonight. I\u2019m pleased with the homer and two-run but the throw, he\u2019s put a lot of time, effort and energy in his arm. He is sincere about being a complete player.\u201d\n\nWashington tied the score 2-2 on V\u00edctor Robles\u2019 RBI single in the fourth and Anthony Rendon\u2019s 34th homer leading off the sixth. Ozuna charged on Robles\u2019 hit and made a one-hop throw to catcher Yadier Molina, who tagged out Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera trying to score from second.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting my rhythm back,\u201d Ozuna said. \u201cI\u2019m almost there.\u201d\n\nSean Doolittle (6-5) walked Fowler with one out in the seventh, Hunter Strickland walked Paul Goldschmidt with two outs and Ozuna doubled just inside the left-field line, just the second hit in 11 at-bats for the Cardinals with runners in scoring position.\n\n\u201cHe just missed with his pitch,\u201d Hale said. \u201cHe just sort of pulled it across the plate, and Ozuna did a nice job.\u201d\n\nHudson (16-7) won for the sixth time in seven starts, giving up two runs and five hits in seven innings.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have very much tonight,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cThe ball was moving a lot, but I didn\u2019t have the best command. I had to battle with what I had.\u201d\n\nJohn Brebbia, Andrew Miller and Mart\u00ednez followed with perfect relief. One day after he was released from a hospital following respiratory problems caused by asthma and allergies, Martinez needed just two pitches to retired Ryan Zimmerman on a flyout for his 20th save in 23 chances.\n\n\u201cI told them I had two innings in me because right now, I feel good. I needed just two pitches,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cI\u2019m focused to compete. I was happy to get out there. They need me. I\u2019m ready for tomorrow and the next day.\u201d\n\nStrasburg gave up two runs, three hits and four walks in five innings, his shortest outing since Aug. 3. He is 3-2 in his last nine outings after winning seven straight starts in late June and July, leaving his record at 17-6.\n\nHOLD ON\n\nMiller tied his season best with his 27th hold.\n\nBASE BURGLERS\n\nMolina, Kolten Wong, Tommy Edman and Dexter Fowler all stole second base, raising the Cardinals\u2018 NL-leading total to 109.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNationals: LHP Patrick Corbin (12-7, 3.20) is 1-2 with a 4.89 ERA against the Cardinals. His lone win came in 2016 when he pitched for Arizona.\n\nCardinals: RHP Miles Mikolas (9-13, 4.28) beat the Nationals 5-1 on May 1 when matched against Max Scherzer.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Dakota Hudson is a big fan of Marcell Ozuna's arm.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Warren Mayes"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/nationals_cardinals_baseball_66483_c0-213-5103-3188_s1770x1032.jpg?9da276ccda780477c5f4ccdeea53e45d7dd5b7ea", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
