And it doesn\u2019t even come back if you quit and log back in.\n\nFallout 76 was already infamous for the volume and seriousness of its bugs but that was when it was just a standalone game. Having to pay an expensive subscription just to discover even more problems is probably not what most fans were hoping for \u2013 even if they secretly expected it.\n\nThe dream of Fallout 1st don\u2019t seem to match the reality\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Fallout 76 gets \u00a3100 a year subscription service called Fallout 1st\n\nMORE: Fallout 76 power armour helmet recall as 20,000 pose health risk\n\nMORE: Fallout 76 gets human NPCs, battle royale mode, and free trial", "description": "Fans have discovered that despite exorbitant costs the new premium subscription service for Fallout 76 doesn\u2019t do what it says on the tin.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/WCCFfallout7639-3452_1571932269.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
