He dishes it out a lot so the boys would be more than happy if he has to pay it.\"\n\nMarler continued to remonstrate with Owens as he left the pitch to take his place on the bench.\n\nEngland dominated the early skirmishes in Yokohama, with Tuilagi crashing over for the opening try after just 96 seconds -- setting the All Blacks on their way to their first World Cup defeat in 12 years.\n\nHowever, New Zealand's players and coaches dismissed the significance of the haka challenge, while Springboks head coach Rassie Erasmus said: \"I don't think it was disrespectful... I wouldn't make a big issue about it, but it's not for me to decide.\"\n\nWorld Rugby's decision to fine England opens the governing body to accusations of hypocrisy, however, after trumpeting England's response to the haka with a video post that was widely viewed online.\n\nThe clip on World Rugby's YouTube channel, entitled \"England's incredible response to intense New Zealand haka\", has racked up more than four million views.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "England have been fined for crossing the halfway line during New Zealand's haka after they formed a provocative V-shaped formation at last weekend's World Cup semi-final in Yokohama, tournament organisers said Wednesday.
