William McRaven, who led the operation that killed Usama bin Laden. \u201c[I]f this president doesn\u2019t demonstrate the leadership that America needs, both domestically and abroad, then it is time for a new person in the Oval Office \u2014 Republican, Democrat or independent \u2014 the sooner, the better,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe fate of our Republic depends upon it.\u201d\n\nREP. PAUL GOSAR: TRUMP WAS RIGHT TO WITHDRAW TROOPS FROM SYRIA \u2013 WE SHOULD PROTECT US BORDERS INSTEAD\n\nIn the essay, McRaven described a recent encounter with troops. He wrote, \u201cThe America that they believed in was under attack, not from without, but from within\u2026These men and women, of all political persuasions, have seen the assaults on our institutions. \u2026 They have seen our leaders stand beside despots and strongmen, preferring their government narrative to our own. They have seen us abandon our allies and have heard the shouts of betrayal from the battlefield. \u2026\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cWe are the most powerful nation in the world because we try to be the good guys. \u2026 If our promises are meaningless, how will our allies ever trust us? If we can\u2019t have faith in our nation\u2019s principles, why would the men and women of this nation join the military? And if they don\u2019t join, who will protect us? If we are not the champions of the good and the right, then who will follow us? And if no one follows us \u2014 where will the world end up?\u201d\n\nEven Republicans are starting to recognize that Trump isn\u2019t putting the interests of the United States first.\n\nOn Friday, Rep. Francis Rooney, R.-Fla., who represents a 59 percent Trump district, stated after Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney seemed to admit there was a quid pro quo with Ukraine, \u201cI didn\u2019t take this job to keep it. I took this job to do the right thing at all times \u2014 the right thing. \u2026 I\u2019ll be looking at my children a lot longer than I\u2019m looking to anybody in this building.\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019ve been real mindful of the fact that during Watergate, all the people I knew said, \u2018Oh, they\u2019re just abusing Nixon, and it\u2019s a witch hunt.\u2019 Turns out it wasn\u2019t a witch hunt. It was really bad.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Rooney announced he will not run for reelection.\n\nSo what happened to provoke Pelosi, McRaven and Rooney?\n\nWell, Christmas came early to the Kremlin thanks to Donald Trump \u2026 and a lot of gifts were delivered in the last two weeks alone.\n\nFirst, Trump gave approval to Turkey to invade Syria. That means Russia can operate with impunity in Syria. With Trump\u2019s capitulation, Russia is positioning itself as the power to trust in the region. That\u2019s why the Kurds, who fought and beat ISIS on our behalf, and who Trump betrayed are now trying to make a deal with Putin. In the meantime, Turkey is committing genocide against the Kurds and no one stopping them. Until the pause announced last week, Innocent men, women, and children were being slaughtered.\n\nEven Republicans are starting to recognize that Trump isn\u2019t putting the interests of the United States first.\n\nThese attacks have prompted renewed talk of banishing Turkey from NATO, which could break up the alliance \u2013 a longtime goal of Putin\u2019s. In fact, Erdogan meets with Putin this week. Normally, the United States would lead the effort to remove Turkey but Trump won\u2019t do it. Adding insult to injury, Trump has invited Erdogan to Washington in November. A war criminal in the White House is something every American should agree is unacceptable and outrageous.\n\nSecond, remember at the United Nations when Trump urged Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to \u201cget together and solve your problem\u201d with Putin? Well, Zelensky appears ready to sign a deal over eastern Ukraine largely on Putin\u2019s terms. Clearly, Zelensky\u2019s hand has been forced as Ukraine lost the backing of the United States, as evidenced by Trump\u2019s reported withholding of aid in exchange for detrimental information on his political opponent Joe Biden. The potential Ukraine-Russia deal has also led to protests in the streets of Ukraine, furthering Putin\u2019s goal of unrest and instability in this region.\n\nThird, Trump wants to bring Putin into the G-7 fold. Russia was banned from the group for annexing Crimea. Trump will use the next meeting, which he will host, to insist Putin be readmitted, despite even more egregious behavior since the annexation. Even if Putin is denied admission, he\u2019s already reaped the benefits of having the United States advocating for him and against our allies \u2026 again.\n\nLast, but not least, it was also announced the United States and Russia will hold joint cyber exercises. Just in time for the 2020 election and only 105 days until the Iowa caucuses. After blatantly interfering in our elections in 2016, and with apparently nothing to stop them in 2020, what could possibly go wrong? Help Trump? Hurt Trump\u2019s opponents or potential Democratic nominee? Sound familiar?\n\nWhy? Why is Trump doing everything he can to make Putin happy? Does the president want Putin interfering in another U.S. election, essentially helping Trump? Is Putin putting pressure on Trump? Does Putin think Trump will be impeached and removed from office so he\u2019s getting what he wants now?\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThe answers to these questions and more will likely be revealed during the impeachment inquiry. Those answers will also force us to face one of the biggest tests of our democracy -- and failure isn\u2019t an option.\n\nIn the meantime, Christmas has come early to the Kremlin and Russia is celebrating at our expense.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM MARY ANNE MARSH", "description": "\u201cAll roads lead to Putin,\u201d Nancy Pelosi stated in her dramatic confrontation with Trump at the White House.", "authors": ["Mary Anne Marsh"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/20/694940094001_6096257702001_6096254581001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
