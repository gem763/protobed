U.S. stocks had a mixed performance on Tuesday. Treasury yields recovered, momentum stocks sold off, and value stocks rose. Apple stock (ticker: AAPL) ended flat after the company announced its new iPhone 11. Ford Motor stock (F) tumbled after credit-ratings firm Moody\u2019s downgraded the auto maker\u2019s bonds to junk status. Uber Technologies (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) jumped despite a pending California bill that would classify ride-share drivers as employees. The initial public offering of WeWork\u2019s parent company is in question after the valuation was slashed and its biggest outside investor raised concerns. In today\u2019s After the Bell, we...\n\nwatch Treasury yields continue to rise from last week\u2019s cycle low;\n\nexplore the impact of a changing sentiment on different market corners;\n\nand explain why a California bill might catch the ride-sharing giants in a jam.\n\nDiverging Trend\n\nAll three major indexes ended little changed from Monday, but performance across the different market corners diverged significantly. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 73.92 points, or 0.28%, to close at 26,909.43. The S&P 500 edged up 0.96 points, or 0.03%, to finish at 2979.39, and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 3.28 points, or 0.04%, to close at 8084.16.\n\nAs headlines about the U.S.-China trade war wind down, and the two sides prepare for the next round of negotiations in October, investors\u2019 fears seem to have subsided, as well.\n\nAfter falling sharply throughout August, yields on 10-year Treasury notes started to show signs of a rebound from last week, increasing 25 basis points to 1.706% this Tuesday from the all-time low of 1.461% last Tuesday. Both the 10-year and 30-year Treasury yields have hit one-month highs; prices and yields move in the opposite directions.\n\nA recovering sentiment and rising bond yields have had different impacts on different market corners. Bank stocks, whose revenue and profitability rely on interest rates on loans, continued their weeklong rally on Tuesday, with the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) rising 1.7% at close. On the other hand, the real-estate investment trust stocks in the S&P 500 tumbled 1.5%. The sector is traditionally considered \u201cbond proxy\u201d due to its high dividend payment. As bond yields go up, it appears less attractive for income seekers.\n\nEditor's Choice\n\nThe sudden shift in sentiment has also caused some pain in momentum stocks, which were once the market\u2019s best performers, while boosting value stocks, which have underperformed for almost a decade. At the same time, the price of gold retreated to $1,496.20 per ounce on Tuesday from its seven-year high of $1,560.40 last week. Still, some analysts believe the precious metal can soar all the way to $2,000 per ounce, and post new cyclical highs at some point in the next year or two,\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that California Democrats are poised to pass a landmark legislation that would classify some contract workers as employees, which would entitle them to benefits such as a minimum hourly wage and workers\u2019 compensation. The bill would apply to workers in many industries from truck drivers to music workers, but two Silicon Valley companies\u2014ride-sharing giants Uber and Lyft\u2014would likely be affected the most.\n\nBoth companies\u2019 business models rely on large pools of contractors, and they have spent much of the year pushing back on the bill. Uber and Lyft claim the bill would introduce additional costs to passengers and take away the job flexibility most drivers desire. Their effort has failed against opposition from labor unions and a large Democratic majority in Sacramento. The bill, if passed, will take effect next January.\n\nUber and Lyft both went public this year, and their stock performances haven\u2019t been ideal. Still, the two stocks jumped 3.9% and 2.4%, respectively, on Tuesday as investors largely shrugged off the news that\u2019s already been in play for months.\n\nWrite to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.com", "description": "Stocks had a mixed performance on Tuesday.
