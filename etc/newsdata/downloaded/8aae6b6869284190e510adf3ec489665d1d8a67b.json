As well as ESPN, it is also the parent company of television giant ABC.\n\n\"Every deal that we're negotiating right now we are looking at how do we acquire rights, not just for the linear package but for ESPN+,\" ESPN president Jimmy Pitaro told Bloomberg in May.\n\nWarnerMedia is also a sporting heavyweight and has already secured the digital rights to several events, including college basketball, which is massively popular in the United States.\n\nEven if Disney and WarnerMedia offer sports with their online video services, they are unlikely to make all of their content available on a streaming platform, industry analysts say.\n\nThat's because traditional television, despite a decline in viewers, is by far still their main source of income owing to cable subscriptions and advertising.\n\nThere is also a technical reason for the cautious approach.\n\nTechnical glitches have impacted the screening of some sports. An ESPN live stream of a 2014 soccer World Cup match between the USA and Germany crashed due to high demand.\n\nMore and more organizations have their own streaming offers, available almost anywhere in the world, including NBA League Pass which allows users to watch all games, live and on-demand.\n\nWith several broadcasters bidding for rights and with fans having to buy a variety of packages in order to watch their favorite sports, Oklahoma State professor McGuire is certain of one thing.\n\n\"It will continue getting more and more expensive in the coming years,\" he said.\n\nAgence France - Presse", "description": "Streaming services have long focused on series and movies, but as online TV competition heats up, live sports - historically a bit player on these platforms - could change the game.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/30/5db8ea1aa310cf3e97a38166.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
