The venture capital firm had previously raised $75 million from investors including Desjardins and the Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec. (The Logic)\n\nTalking point: This is a relatively cheap way for iA Financial to get access to Luge startups, which have the potential to make its business\u2014and the $187 billion it currently has in assets under management\u2014more efficient. Rival insurance firm Power Financial, for example, has invested hundreds of millions in fintech startups, including robo-adviser Wealthsimple. IA\u2019s bet is lower risk, but also lower reward. It\u2019ll own a fraction of potential new investments. For Luge Capital, the injection of new money comes as it\u2019s competing in the increasingly crowded space of early-stage fintech financing. In September, Information Venture Partners raised a $96-million fund focused partially on early-stage fintech.", "description": "", "authors": ["Zane Schwartz"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
