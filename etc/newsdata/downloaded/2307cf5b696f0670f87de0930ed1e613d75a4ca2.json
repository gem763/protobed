Former Ukrainian prosecutor general Victor Shokin was conducting an investigation of the company, but was himself accused of corruption and fired in 2016 after Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government at the behest of U.S. and European Union officials.\n\nTrump and Giuliani have alleged a conflict of interest between the former vice president and his son.\n\nHouse Democrats are currently conducting an impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s own dealings in Ukraine.\n\nIn a July phone conversation, Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the allegations against the Bidens. One week earlier Trump had ordered a halt to a military aid package destined for Ukraine and approved by Congress. The timing has led Democrats to raise the suspicion that Trump used the aid package to pressure Ukraine to conduct an investigation damaging to a political rival.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich told Congress on Friday that President Trump pushed the State Department to remove her from office after his lawyer Rudy Giuliani repeatedly accused her of protecting Joe Biden's interests in Ukraine.In her testimony, Yovanovich speculated that Giuliani", "authors": ["Zachary Evans"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/iHUL5_xqParS9cvjHb2G0w--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/0e4e72e4039a905937c87c1f3313b493", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
