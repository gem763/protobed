They had hoped to vote on the bill on Wednesday. They accuse the government of deliberately trying to sabotage the EU trade deal.\n\n\u201cOver the past two weeks Ukraine\u2019s opposition has submitted four different draft laws to enable Yulia Tymoshenko to seek medical treatment abroad. But the Party of Regions has not agreed on any of them,\u201d said Arseniy Yatsenyuk, leader of the Batkivschina opposition party.\n\nRussia strongly opposes the EU trade deal \u2013 it wants a Moscow-based customs union and has threatened counter-measures.\n\nSome think President Victor Yanukovich may be cooling on his official pro-EU stance, but his party denies the trade deal is dead.\n\n\u201cIf to be honest the Vilnius Summit were held tomorrow we would vote today. But the summit will be held on November 28,\u201d said Party of Regions MP Volodymyr Makeenko.\n\nThe ruling party blames the opposition for refusing to co-operate on talks.\n\nYulia Tymoshenko is serving a seven year jail term for abuse of office after a trial the EU says was political.\n\nThe former prime minister is suffering from chronic back pain.\n\nA criminal action brought against her lawyer has further soured the atmosphere.\n\nBut one of the EU envoys, the former Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski still holds out hope:\n\n\u201cThe Parliamentary working group is now working on the draft law that will enable Mrs Tymoshenko to go for treatment abroad. And we hope that all the issues and misunderstandings will be solved before the new parliamentary session next Tuesday November 19,\u201d he said.\n\nWith the Vilnius summit only two weeks away, the envoys\u2019 shuttle diplomacy continues.\n\nSummit host Lithuania said there would be no success unless Ukraine produced \u201cresults\u201d.\n\nGermany has warned that time is running out for Kyiv to settle Tymoshenko\u2019s case.", "description": "EU envoys are to visit Ukraine again next week in a last-ditch effort to break the deadlock over the case of jailed opposition leader Yulia", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/archive/1000x563_archive.jpg", "published_at": "2013-11-13"}
