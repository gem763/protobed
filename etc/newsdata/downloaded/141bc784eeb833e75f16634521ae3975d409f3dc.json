It's a classic RPG that's aiming for release in April 2021 across PC, all consoles and mobiles, with a hook that revolves around the philosophical approach of the player character.\n\nAs you play through, your questing choices and dialogue options will affect your philosophy, which in turn feeds back into the choices you can make in the things you do and say.\n\nCompanions, a broken wasteland, turn-based combat personality-based choices that remind me of Fallout and classic computer RPGs, and Aussie accents that haven't gone all Crocodile Dundee to appeal to Americans.
