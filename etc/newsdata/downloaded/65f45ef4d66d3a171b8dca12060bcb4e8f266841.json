They\u2019ve already been rumbled by Tim, Woody & Ella!\" said one.\n\n\"These pair are the epitome of cringe! \"I think we're getting away with this you know\" not with Sherlock Tim and Dr Watson Woody on your case!\" said another.\n\n\"Jack and Beth are the biggest pair of chumps going. Can't wait for Detective Tim to see right through 'Joyce'\" said a third.\n\n\"Tim asking that question got them on their toes a bit, hopefully he will figure them out tomorrow night...\" added a fourth.\n\nTim even wondered whether seemingly popular Joyce would replace him in the game, as the other players could only want one older player.\n\nMeanwhile Ella and Brooke bonded over the double blocking and slammed Jack for his flirty behaviour, sliding into both Brooke and Georgina's DMs.\n\nThey also discussed receiving x-rated pictures and were both roaring with laughter during their saucy conversation.\n\n\"If I had a penny for every d*** pic i received I wouldn't need the prize money!\" exclaimed Brooke.\n\nBeth and Jack had been voted the bottom two in the ratings, meaning they were immediately blocked from the game.\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nWhile Woody and Ella were named the new influencers, they didn't actually have to choose anyone to leave with catfish Beth and fellow newcomer Jack chosen in the recent vote.\n\nThe players were told that their former neighbours would be meeting before they left the show for good, with Beth and Jack then preparing themselves for the meeting.\n\nAs Beth and Jack met for the first time after flirting via a private chat, he was stunned to learn she wasn't the girl in her photos.\n\nBeth claimed she wanted to be the \"girl next door\" and have people get to know her for her personality, and not her looks.\n\nThe Circle airs all week at 10pm on Channel 4, except for Saturdays.", "description": "Tim could be on to Jack and Beth as their mask slips when pretending to be player 'Joyce' on The Circle", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Channel"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20533967.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_THE-CIRCLE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
