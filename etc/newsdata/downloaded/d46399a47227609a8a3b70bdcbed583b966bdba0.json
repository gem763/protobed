REUTERS/Thomas Peter/File Photo\n\nLower-level U.S. and Chinese officials are expected to meet within days in Washington ahead of talks between top trade negotiators in early October, seeking to ease a dispute that for more than a year has rattled financial markets and fueled fears of a global recession.\n\nTop-level negotiators last met face-to-face in China in July.\n\nWashington is pressing China for an end to policies and practices including industrial subsidies and forced technology transfer. Meeting those demands would require structural change that it is unclear China would be willing to undertake.\n\nThe trade war is impacting the global economy. The International Monetary Fund on Thursday forecast that U.S. and Chinese tit-for-tat tariffs could reduce global GDP in 2020 by 0.8% and trigger more losses afterward.\n\nGlobal stocks rose on Thursday after both sides made concessions ahead of the talks. On Thursday, China importers bought at least 10 cargoes, or 600,000 tonnes, of U.S. soybeans for October-December shipment, the country\u2019s most significant purchases since at least June, U.S. traders with direct knowledge of the deals said.\n\nThat came after U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday delayed an increase in tariffs on Chinese goods by two weeks and China exempted some U.S. drugs and other goods from tariffs.\n\nWhile welcoming China\u2019s overtures, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin sought to temper optimism in markets that the gestures might lead to a trade deal. He told CNBC that Trump was prepared to keep or even raise tariffs on Chinese imports and that Beijing had asked for more concessions beyond the removal of tariffs.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that China was seeking to narrow the scope of negotiations to trade matters by excluding national security issues.\n\nAGRICULTURAL GOODS\n\nThe soybean purchases sent benchmark prices of the commodity, of which China is the top buyer, soaring. They were the largest by private Chinese importers since Beijing raised import tariffs on the U.S. oilseed by 25% in July 2018 in retaliation for U.S. duties on Chinese goods. Duties were raised an additional 5% this month.\n\nU.S. farmers, a core component of Trump\u2019s political base, have been among the hardest hit by the tariff battle that began more than a year ago and has escalated in recent weeks.\n\nWe \u201cexpect and we want them to buy agriculture. We view that as a personal attack on our farmers. They need our agriculture, and they\u2019ve always bought our agriculture. So, this isn\u2019t about just selling them soybeans, but we want to sell them soybeans,\u201d Mnuchin said.\n\nEarlier in the day in Beijing, Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said Chinese firms have started to inquire about prices for U.S. farm goods. He also said that China welcomed the U.S. delay to its scheduled tariff hike on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods.\n\n\u201c(China) hopes both sides would continue to meet each other half way and adopt concrete actions to create favorable conditions for negotiations,\u201d Gao told a briefing, noting that possible purchases included pork and soybeans, both of which are still subject to hefty Chinese duties.\n\nChina has bought U.S. pork despite tariffs of 62% in place since last year because huge numbers of pigs have been culled across the country as Beijing struggles to contain an outbreak of African swine fever. The world\u2019s biggest pork consumer has hiked imports to make up the shortfall.\n\nChina said it would reduce purchases of U.S. farm products in August after Trump vowed to impose new tariffs on around $300 billion of Chinese goods, dimming prospects of a deal.\n\nOn Wednesday, the United States agreed to delay increasing tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports from Oct. 1 to Oct. 15. The tariffs on those goods were set to increase to 30% from 25%.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. dollar and China yuan notes are seen in this picture illustration June 2, 2017.

But I don\u2019t think anything\u2019s changed on the fundamentals, and once they get back to the table, they\u2019ll discover that.\u201d", "description": "The United States on Thursday welcomed China's renewed purchases of U.S. farm goods while maintaining the threat of U.S. tariff hikes as the world's two largest economies prepared the ground for talks aimed at breaking the logjam in their trade war.", "authors": ["Stella Qiu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429041344&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0UU", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
