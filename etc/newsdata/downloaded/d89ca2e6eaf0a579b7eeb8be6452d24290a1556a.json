In fact, a very different one is raging behind the scenes at Westminster \u2013 what should happen first, a general election or Final Say referendum?\n\nThe answer could decide the final chapter of the Brexit saga. Until this week, the widespread assumption was an election, probably in late November. But in recent days, I\u2019ve been struck by the growing opposition to an election among Labour MPs, and the growing fears among ministers that Jeremy Corbyn will deny Boris Johnson one.\n\nFor an election to be called without the government first being brought down, the support of two-thirds of MPs is needed under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. The assumption was that Johnson would get the numbers because Labour would give the go-ahead once a crash-out on 31 October had been avoided.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAnd Corbyn still wants an early election. \u201cHis instincts are telling him \u2018just go for it\u2019 and he will trust his instincts,\u201d said one MP close to him. But there are wobbles at the highest level of the Labour Party. A good rule of politics is not to give your enemy what they want, and who desperately wants an election more than anyone? Johnson. If Labour denied him, he would head a \u201czombie government\u201d, limping on with a majority of minus 45, unable to pass legislation, a Queen\u2019s Speech or a budget.\n\nOne minister admitted to me: \u201cI fear Corbyn will pull the plug and keep us waiting until next spring. For every extra week we stayed in power, we would lose public support.\u201d Another Tory source predicted an election on the date scheduled under the act before Theresa May called her ill-fated 2017 contest \u2013 five years after the May 2015 election.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The club will lose their membership at midnight if they don't find a buyer or prove that they have the means to pay off their debts PA\n\nLabour officials admit it would be easier to \u201cget our vote out\u201d in a spring election than in a winter one. They see the attraction of letting the prime minister \u201cstew in his own juice\u201d. For many Labour MPs, there\u2019s a more prosaic reason to delay: they fear they would lose their seats in a \u201cBrexit election\u201d dominated by one big figure \u2013 Johnson. \u201cWe could be slaughtered,\u201d one said. They fear Labour\u2019s fence-sitting Brexit policy is unsellable on the doorstep.\n\nThe shadow cabinet will discuss election timing next week. Senior frontbenchers, including John McDonnell, Sir Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry, see the merits of a referendum before an election, which could then be fought on much more friendly territory for Labour \u2013 austerity and inequality, for example.\n\nLegislation for a Final Say referendum was defeated by 12 votes in April but is now coming down the track again. Another vote could happen at the special Commons sitting next Saturday. \u201cA commons majority is emerging,\u201d said one leading supporter. That would require a coalition of Labour, other opposition parties and \u2013 the crucial difference \u2013 some of the former Tories who lost the whip for opposing no deal.\n\nA referendum would resolve Brexit cleanly; an election could easily result in another hung parliament, so we could be back to square one. Johnson could win an election on 35 per cent of the vote, hardly an endorsement of his Brexit strategy. Many people would vote on other issues.\n\nThe case for a referendum does not depend on Johnson securing a Brexit deal in the revitalised negotiations underway in Brussels. If he gets one, there would be a good chance of MPs making it conditional on a confirmatory referendum \u2013 offering the public a choice between the deal and Remain. If he does not, supporters of a people\u2019s vote might propose a confirmatory referendum on May\u2019s withdrawal agreement, with Remain the other option.\n\nThis is not as mad as it sounds. An amended version of May\u2019s agreement, with safeguards on workers\u2019 rights, health and safety and the environment, was never put to a parliamentary vote. It would potentially win more Labour support than Johnson\u2019s deal, which does not offer such reassurances.\n\nThe Commons voting to back a referendum would be only the start of the process. It would take six months to hold one, demanding a longer extension of the UK\u2019s EU membership than the three months proposed by the Benn Act. It would require government legislation. That in turn would require Johnson to swallow a six-month delay to stay in power and argue for his deal in a referendum; if he refused, he would have to be ousted in a vote of no confidence, and an agreement then reached on a caretaker prime minister \u2013 something that has so far eluded opposition parties.\n\nIt would also require Corbyn to cool his natural desire for an early election. But patience might be rewarded: with the Brexit war finally resolved, voters might just trust Labour with the peace \u2013 as they did in 1945.", "description": "We might expect the debate among MPs to be simple: deal or no deal.
