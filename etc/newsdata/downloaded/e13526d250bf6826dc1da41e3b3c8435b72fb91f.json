There\u2019s a stereotype around how tech people dress, and it has no room for a woman like Kinjil Mathur, the Chief Marketing Officer at Squarespace, who regularly shows up to work in a mix of sleek, monochromatic pieces by the likes of Isabel Marant, Chanel, and Reformation.\n\nMathur is happy to defy expectations. Born in Texas, she did a tour of the fashion world before landing in tech, working at Neiman Marcus and Conde Nast and then spending five years at Saks Fifth Avenue, where she became Vice President of Digital Marketing. Following Saks, Mathur hopped over to Foursquare before reaching Squarespace. In addition to her day job, she also serves as an executive committee member on the CFDA Fashion Trust and holds a board position on Ellevest, a startup focused on helping women invest.\n\nThe Cut caught up with Mathur at the sleek Squarespace offices. There, she talked about how her version of a work uniform, the way her style has evolved, and why she never worries about spills.\n\nPhoto: Gabriela Herman\n\nOn her everyday shoes: I\u2019m trying to simplify my life wherever I can, so whatever I wear has to handle the walk to work and the stairs between Squarespace floors, plus transition seamlessly to post-work events. That means I\u2019ll wear something with 2-inch block heel or an ankle boots. My favorites are from Chanel, Dior and Isabel Marant.\n\nOn going out after work: Six months ago I became a mama to Ceyone, my beautiful baby boy. So, these days I make it a point to be home for his bedtime. It\u2019s nice to take a breather, spend some quality time with my family. Plus there\u2019s the added bonus of being able to change and freshen up before heading out to the next event. It also allows for me to get a little more playful in my look with pieces that don\u2019t make sense for the office like a Brock Collection dress or some Johanna Ortiz wide leg pants.\n\nOn what she wears to important meetings: I try not to overthink what I\u2019m wearing. I\u2019ve adopted a personal guideline for workday dressing that includes a monochrome palette\u2014 I\u2019m almost always in all white or all black. It simplifies the getting dressed process and frees up more time for meeting prep in the morning. I like brands like Sacai, Comme des Gar\u00e7ons and Helmut Lang \u2013 they have interesting separates but they don\u2019t distract from what I\u2019m saying. And as for staining my white clothes? I swear by being fearless and just going for it \u2013 spills really don\u2019t happen unless you\u2019re worrying about it.\n\nOn style in the tech space: While I work for a tech company, one of our core values is \u201cDesign is not a Luxury\u201d and you can see that in everything, down to our office space. We pay attention to detail and aesthetics and the environment is filled with people who have a deep appreciation for design. That means there\u2019s a lot of great personal style, so luckily I don\u2019t feel as though I\u2019ve had to alter my fashion choices to assimilate into a stereotypical tech environment.\n\nOn who she dresses for: I\u2019m an early riser, so by the time I\u2019m leaving home, I\u2019ve had enough time (and caffeine!) to determine what mood I need to set for myself to seize the day. What I wear has a big influence over how I feel. For example, if I have a day packed with creative thinking, I\u2019ll most likely wear something from a brand that inspires me, like Jacquemus.\n\nOn how her style has evolved: When I worked at Saks, I got a first look at the upcoming collections in market meetings, or directly from our merchant teams. I was working on editorial calendars that were a full season out, and planning campaigns on the top fashion trends. Since I was immersed in fashion all day, it was hard not to obsess over new trends and pre-order pieces in advance.\n\nNowadays, I\u2019m less focused on trends simply because I\u2019m not surrounded by them all day. I\u2019m much more about editing my seasonal wardrobe down to a few staples. However, I still love discovering new designers and I\u2019m currently loving Khaite, Staud, and Markarian.\n\nOn her work uniform: You can\u2019t go wrong with black pants and a white button down. I\u2019ll wear that with my hair pulled back in a low bun and gold hoop earrings. My favorite trousers are by Isabel Marant and 3.1 Phillip Lim, while my top shirts are by Saint Laurent and Reformation.\n\nOn the last three things she bought: A sleek Hunting Season bag, a dress by Hong Kong designer Anais Jourden, and a simple The Line by K turtleneck.\n\nOn the one item that gives her the most confidence: If I want to look especially impressive, I can never go wrong with a Chanel black jacket and a personalized gold necklace with my son\u2019s name\u2014Ceyone.\n\nKinjil wears Chanel boots, $TK available at TK.\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.", "description": "In the latest In Her Shoes we talk to Kinjil Mathur, Chief Marketing Officer at Squarespace.
