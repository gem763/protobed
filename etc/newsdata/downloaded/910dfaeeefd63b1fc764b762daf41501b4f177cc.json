(Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)\n\nOn a wet Sunday afternoon, two distinctly different scenes played out on the brick-paved sidewalks of this historic county seat \u2014 both tinged, and in some moments, dominated, by the rhetoric of Washington politics.\n\nLocals joined with visitors from the nation\u2019s capital and its closer-in suburbs to stage dueling rallies for and against Frederick County Sheriff Chuck Jenkins (R), who was recently sued for allegedly racially profiling a Latina grandmother and criticized for canceling a public meeting on his department\u2019s partnership with federal immigration agents \u2014 a program known as 287(g).\n\nAbout 200 opponents of the sheriff\u2019s actions gathered with homemade pupusas, a Mariachi band and a Democratic congressman who offered aphorisms from the Founding Fathers. A few blocks away, a similar number of Jenkins supporters hoisted American flags of every size and offered booming chants of \u201cUSA! USA! USA!\u201d\n\n\n\nA mariachi band entertains the crowd at a rally in support of immigrants and against the 287(g) program in Frederick. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)\n\nThe demonstrations, in a fast-changing city of 71,000 about 50 miles from Washington, were the latest example of local jurisdictions clashing over whether to cooperate with federal immigration agencies as the Trump administration diverts billions to fund a border wall and slashes the cap on refugees.\n\n\u201cPeople are having a visceral reaction to the divisiveness of the nation,\u201d Frederick County Council President M.C. Keegan-Ayer (D) said last week. \u201cIt\u2019s tearing our county apart.\u201d\n\nIn Baker\u2019s Park, surrounded by yellow police tape and more than two dozen officers, protesters praised the agreement forged by Jenkins 11 years ago, which allows federal agencies to call on local law enforcement officials to enforce immigration-related orders. The program has led to the deportation of more than 1,500 Frederick residents, authorities say, the vast majority undocumented.\n\nSpeakers included Thomas Homan, former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Dan Stein, president of the Washington-based Federation for American Immigration Reform, which supports President Trump\u2019s immigration polices and has been designated as a hate group with links to white supremacists by the Southern Poverty Law Center. There were also women who said their family members had been killed in car accidents caused by undocumented immigrants.\n\nHoman, who received a rock star\u2019s reception as he jogged onto the stage, mentioned Trump more than a dozen times during his speech, nearly always to applause and whistles from the crowd. He praised Jenkins, criticized the hands-off immigration policies of more liberal jurisdictions and said attacks on 287(g) programs are \u201ca pushback against ICE officers who are constantly being vilified by politicians.\u201d\n\n\n\nA sign at the rally in support of the 287(g) program and the policies of Sheriff Chuck Jenkins. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)\n\nWalking distance away, the RISE Coalition of Western Maryland, in conjunction with the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland, hosted a \u201cunity rally,\u201d with the aim of \u201ccelebrating [the] immigrant community.\u201d The crowd listened first to local musicians, then to activists from Frederick and beyond.\n\n\u201cHello Frederick \u2014 the real Frederick County,\u201d said Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), whose district includes parts of the county, but is anchored in more liberal Montgomery. \u201cWe are a people of immigrants. That\u2019s who we are.\u201d\n\nThe protests mark a boiling point in a politically tense year for Frederick County, a growing jurisdiction that was once a Republican stronghold but has recently turned more blue. Trump narrowly won the county in 2016. Two years later, Attorney General Brian E. Frosh and U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin, both Democrats, edged ahead of their Republican opponents, and the county council won a Democratic majority.\n\nAnd while Jenkins (R) successfully fended off Democratic challenger Karl Bickel, the sheriff won with less than 52 percent of the vote, compared with 63 percent in 2014 against the same candidate. Jenkins\u2019 commitment to 287(g), which allows local jails to screen inmates for immigration violations, was a flash point during last year\u2019s election.\n\n\n\nOlga Schrichte, 69, left, and Stefan Schrichte, 63, of Frederick, at a rally in support of immigrants and against the 287(g) program. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)\n\nIn May this year, Jenkins canceled an annual public forum on the program, arguing that attendees in the past had become \u201cdisorderly\u201d and \u201cdisruptive,\u201d the Frederick News-Post reported. RISE filed a complaint to a state board calling for the meeting to be reinstated.\n\nThe group, represented by the ACLU, also sued the sheriff\u2019s office in July, alleging that officers racially profiled Sara Medrano, an undocumented resident who was stopped by police for an alleged broken taillight while driving her daughter and two grandchildren.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Medrano was questioned about her immigration status and detained for more than an hour, while the officers reportedly attempted to contact ICE. Medrano, who was later allowed to return home, says neither taillight on her vehicle was broken.\n\n\u201cThe discriminatory behavior that Ms. Medrano experienced is not an isolated event,\u201d the lawsuit states, citing several other alleged instances of Frederick residents being detained \u201cwithout reasonable suspicion or probable cause.\u201d\n\nIn August, the county council voted to audit the cooperation between the sheriff\u2019s office and ICE, with the aim of examining the cost of their collaboration to taxpayers. Keegan-Ayer, the council president, said the audit is routine, noting that it received bipartisan support in the council. But Jenkins disagreed.\n\n\u201cThe audit is entirely unnecessary,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe county council and county executive \u2026 have chosen to listen to a minority of opposition who don\u2019t trust me, don\u2019t like me.\u201d\n\n\n\nJenkins testifies in September at a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing on the use of ICE detention. (Jose Luis Magana/AP)\n\nAdding fuel to the fire are accusations of \u201coutside influence.\u201d\n\nRISE coordinator Juliana Downey said the group decided to organize its rally when members saw the anti-immigrant organization Help Save Maryland, which is based in neighboring Montgomery, seeking support for Jenkins on Facebook.\n\nJenkins \u2014 who was listed as a speaker for an immigration-related protest co-organized by Help Save Maryland last month, but did not attend \u2014 denied any involvement in the planning of Sunday\u2019s rally to support him. Homan, however, said while speaking that Jenkins personally asked him to attend.\n\nThe permit for the event says it was being hosted by the Republican Club of Frederick County, but current club president Marie Fischer said the group is not behind the rally and that former president Mark Schaff filed the application under the club\u2019s name. (Schaff confirmed this.) The club\u2019s board decided not to endorse the event because they felt the speakers\u2019 list lacked racial diversity, said Fischer, who is black.\n\nDowney accused Republicans of trying to dodge responsibility for \u201cbringing outside white supremacists into the county.\u201d\n\nLocal officials say they have concerns that parties on both sides are being influenced by external groups, but Sergio Espa\u00f1a, the director of engagement and mobilization at the ACLU of Maryland, said RISE reached out to them, not the other way around.\n\n\u201cThe new generation of Frederick residents have more access to information and to other communities,\u201d Espa\u00f1a said. \u201cThey are the folks leading this.\u201d\n\n\n\nProponents and opponents to a bill designating legal funding for undocumented residents at a 2018 council meeting in Montgomery County. (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\nLocal governments in Prince George\u2019s, Fairfax and Montgomery counties recently have curtailed their cooperation with ICE, which already was far more limited than what the 287(g) program entails. In Frederick, any change in cooperation would be up to Jenkins.\n\nBoth Keegan-Ayer, the council president, and County Executive Jan Gardner (D) declined to state whether they supported the 287(g) program. They said last week that they would not be attending either rally this Sunday, citing family commitments.\n\n\u201cOur immigration system is broken,\u201d Keegan-Ayer said. \u201cWe need to fix it, but that\u2019s not something we can do at a local level.\u201d\n\nGardner said: \u201cThis is a very complicated issue and a lot of it is beyond my authority.\u201d She added that residents with strong views should approach members of Congress or Jenkins himself.\n\nThe sheriff showed no sign of budging.\n\n\u201cListen, they can apply all the pressure they choose to apply,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cAs long as I\u2019m in the position, I won\u2019t change my mind \u2026 I\u2019m planting my flag on this hill.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nFrederick County Sheriff Chuck Jenkins is loathed and loved after Down syndrome death\n\nLegal funding for immigrants in detention: A debate that divided this wealthy Md. suburb returns\n\nNo cooperation with ICE: Montgomery\u2019s new ban is strongest in D.C. region\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Tensions are rising in Frederick over local and national immigration enforcement.", "authors": ["Rebecca Tan", "Local Reporter", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/r9EzLKkh7FWGpkpL09AN051LV0o=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SDPXDLXIPUI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
