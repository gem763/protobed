Among his findings:\n\nHow the blaze started\n\nThe Grenfell tragedy started with an electrical fault in the fridge-freezer of Flat 16, occupied by Behailu Kebede, pictured here leaving his flat on the day of the fire. The report said that Kebede was not responsible for what followed\n\nThe Grenfell tragedy started with an electrical fault in the fridge-freezer of Flat 16, but its occupant Behailu Kebede was not to blame, the report says.\n\nSir Martin said it was more important to establish \u2018how the failure of a common domestic appliance could have such disastrous consequences\u2019.\n\n\u2018Inadequate\u2019 fire planning\n\nThe firefighters who repeatedly ran into the burning building were praised for their \u2018extraordinary bravery and selfless devotion to duty\u2019.\n\nBut they were let down by having no training for a fire of such magnitude.\n\nSir Martin said: \u2018The London Fire Brigade\u2019s preparation and planning for a fire such as that at Grenfell Tower was gravely inadequate.\u2019 Officers were faced \u2018with a situation for which they had not properly been prepared\u2019, and commanders had \u2018no training\u2019 on the dangers associated with combustible cladding.\n\nNor did they have any training on how to recognise the need for an evacuation of a high-rise block \u2013 let alone mount one. Sir Martin said there was simply \u2018no contingency plan\u2019 for evacuation.\n\nThe fire service\u2019s database on large London buildings was \u2018many years out of date\u2019 and contained \u2018almost no information of use\u2019.\n\nSafety design flaws\n\nFirefighters spray water onto the Grenfell Tower block which was destroyed in a disastrous fire, in north Kensington, West London, Britain June 16, 2017\n\nThis picture of the Grenfell Tower six months after the blaze shows the damage to the external building. There was a catastrophic failure of \u2018compartmentation\u2019 \u2013 the safety design that supposedly stops fires spreading from flat to flat. The tower\u2019s outside walls failed to comply with building regulations. There was \u2018compelling evidence\u2019 that the walls did not \u2018adequately resist the spread of fire \u2013 on the contrary, they actively promoted it\u2019\n\nFlames and smoke billow as firefighters deal with a serious fire in the Grenfell Tower apartment block at Latimer Road in West London, Britain June 14, 2017\n\nThere was a catastrophic failure of \u2018compartmentation\u2019 \u2013 the safety design that supposedly stops fires spreading from flat to flat.\n\nHad compartmentation worked, it would have contained the blaze in the first flat until firefighters could put it out, enabling occupants elsewhere to \u2018stay put\u2019.\n\nThe \u2018rapid\u2019 failure of compartmentation meant the intensity of the heat shattered glass windows. Kitchen extractor fans were deformed and dislodged, giving the flames a deadly pathway. Fire doors at the front of flats failed in their job, filling lobbies with smoke.\n\nStay-put strategy\n\nLives were probably lost because crews and 999 operators wasted \u2018the best part of an hour\u2019 telling the block\u2019s occupants to \u2018stay put\u2019 in their flats \u2013 before realising the blaze was wildly out of control, the report says.\n\nIncident commanders failed to recognise that compartmentation had failed and a full evacuation may have been necessary. They never gained control.\n\nSir Martin says of the stay-put strategy: \u2018Once it was clear that the fire was out of control and that compartmentation had failed, a decision should have been taken to organise the evacuation.\n\nThat decision should have been made between 1.30am and 1.50am and would be likely to have resulted in fewer fatalities.\u2019\n\nHe said \u2018the best part of an hour was lost\u2019 before the stay-put advice was revoked at 2.47am.\n\nPictured are the ashened lifts inside the Grenfell tower. Lives were probably lost because crews and 999 operators wasted \u2018the best part of an hour\u2019 telling the block\u2019s occupants to \u2018stay put\u2019 in their flats \u2013 before realising the blaze was wildly out of control, the report says\n\nComms shortfalls\n\nMany physical and electronic communication systems did not work properly on the night of the fire. Information sharing between the control room and the commanders on the ground was \u2018improvised, uncertain and prone to error\u2019.\n\nCrucial information about the spread and extent of the fire was not shared by senior officers at the scene \u2013 and they were not kept abreast of vital information that was coming in to the 999 centre from stricken residents.\n\nControl room staff swamped by 999 calls\n\nControl room operators were in the \u2018invidious\u2019 position of being outnumbered by an unprecedented number of 999 calls on the night and \u2018responded with great courage and dedication in the most harrowing of circumstances\u2019, said Sir Martin.\n\nEmotional Kensington firemen join bereaved family members including the parents and sister of Jessica Urbano, at the tribute wall near to Grenfell Tower in West London for a minutes' silence\n\nDaily Mail front page June 15, 2017 - Grenfell Tower FireFalling burning debris at the scene of a huge fire at Grenfell tower block in White City, London\n\nControl room staff \u2018undoubtedly saved lives\u2019, but their operation was beset by \u2018shortcomings in practice, policy and training\u2019. Call handlers did not always obtain necessary details from those inside Grenfell, such as their flat numbers. Others did not know when to tell residents to evacuate.\n\nMistakes at a similar blaze were repeated\n\nDamningly, the report says lessons had not been learnt from the Lakanal House fire of 2009. Three women and three children died in that high-rise blaze in Camberwell, South London which bore many similar traits.\n\nSir Martin said: \u2018Mistakes made in responding to the Lakanal House fire were repeated.\u2019\n\nHe said 999 operators were \u2018not aware of the danger of assuming that crews would always reach callers\u2019.\n\nCladding failures\n\nOutgoing fire chief Dany Cotton was criticised for her evidence to the inquiry in September last year\n\nThe tower\u2019s outside walls failed to comply with building regulations. There was \u2018compelling evidence\u2019 that the walls did not \u2018adequately resist the spread of fire \u2013 on the contrary, they actively promoted it.\u2019\n\nDany Cotton\n\nOutgoing fire chief Dany Cotton was criticised for her evidence to the inquiry in September last year. Sir Martin suggested her attitude meant the brigade was at risk of failing to learn the lessons from Grenfell.\n\nHe also highlighted her apparent lack of curiosity on arriving at the scene when told the stay-put advice had been abandoned.\n\nSir Martin wrote: \u2018Quite apart from its remarkable insensitivity to the families of the deceased and to those who escaped from their burning homes with their lives, the Commissioner\u2019s evidence that she would not change anything about the response, even with hindsight, only serves to demonstrate that the LFB is an institution at risk of not learning the lessons of the fire.\u2019", "description": "The London Fire Brigade was plagued with 'institutional failures' and its preparation for a Grenfell-style inferno was 'gravely inadequate', the retired judge found.", "authors": ["Daily Mail Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/22/20350428-0-image-a-16_1572387744551.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
