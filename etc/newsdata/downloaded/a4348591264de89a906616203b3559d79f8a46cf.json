During the Democrat debate Tuesday night, the Washington Post ran a story that Sanders will be endorsed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Saturday.\n\nIt isn\u2019t really a big surprise, though, because AOC worked on Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign. She has not hidden her admiration of Sanders as she serves in the House of Representatives. As the WaPo article points out, \u201cshe was recruited to run for Congress in 2018 by Justice Democrats, a group that grew out of the Sanders campaign.\u201d Sanders was the first Democrat presidential candidate who endorsed her Green New Deal.\n\nSanders is scheduled to have a campaign rally on Saturday in Queens. The purpose is for him to get back on the campaign trail and prove he\u2019s healthy enough to continue on in the race after suffering a heart attack. What better way to make a splash than to promise a \u201cspecial guest\u201d and then tease the upcoming endorsement of AOC? He took the opportunity to do so when he was asked about his health during the debate.\n\nAsked about his health directly at the debate on Tuesday night, Mr. Sanders nodded to the rally and to the \u201cspecial guest.\u201d \u201cLet me invite you all to a major rally we\u2019re having in Queens,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a special guest at that event, and we are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country.\u201d He also said, \u201cI\u2019m feeling great.\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign is billing the New York rally as his official return to the campaign trail. It had toyed with holding the rally in Prospect Park in Brooklyn, according to an aide, but settled on a park in Queens, with a backdrop of the Manhattan skyline.\n\nAnd just like that Rep. Ilhan Omar jumped in and stole AOC\u2019s thunder. She announced her endorsement of Bernie Sanders for president, too. She didn\u2019t bother waiting for Saturday\u2019s rally. She and Bernie had a little love fest on Twitter.\n\n.@IlhanMN is a leader of strength and courage. She won't back down from a fight with billionaires and the world\u2019s most powerful corporations to transform our country so it works for all of us. Together we will build a multiracial working class coalition to win the White House. https://t.co/fQ6p9sLwle \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) October 16, 2019\n\nOmar and Sanders are teaming up for universal school meals. Just put \u201cuniversal\u201d in front of anything and it flies for Socialists.\n\nIt's true! @SenSanders and I just introduced sweeping legislation to make school meals universal. In the richest country in the world, no child should go to school hungry. https://t.co/NxTa34oSxw \u2014 Rep. Ilhan Omar (@Ilhan) October 15, 2019\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more. Rep. Rashida Tlaib doesn\u2019t intend to let the moment pass without tagging along. She\u2019s endorsing Bernie, too. The three members of The Squad will all be in New York to endorse Bernie at his \u201cBernie\u2019s Back\u201d rally. All that is missing now is for Rep. Ayanna Pressley to join in to make The Squad\u2019s move complete.\n\nRoughly half an hour after the Post\u2019s report was released, CNN politics reporter Greg Krieg revealed that congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib will also be endorsing Sanders in New York on Saturday. The \u201cBernie\u2019s Back\u201d Saturday rally will be held in Queens, near Ocasio-Cortez\u2019 congressional district and hometown, according to the Post.\n\nNot to point to the obvious, but I will. It will be quite a spectacle to see Bernie Sanders, a Jew, standing alongside the three most publicly anti-Semitic congresswomen on stage, basking in the glow of their endorsements.\n\nThis is a blow to Elizabeth Warren, nonetheless. Last month Warren captured the endorsement of the Working Families Party. This was a big deal because they endorsed Bernie in 2016. Many of his supporters were not happy about that announcement.\n\nPresidential endorsements from the congresswomen, both members of the group of first-term Democratic women of color known as \u201cthe squad,\u201d were highly coveted. In addition to being among the country\u2019s most prominent progressives, they have also become some of President Trump\u2019s favorite foils. Last month, Ms. Warren won the endorsement of the Working Families Party, a progressive group that endorsed Mr. Sanders during the last presidential cycle. The endorsement was a boon to Ms. Warren\u2019s candidacy as she aimed to position herself as Mr. Biden\u2019s main rival and the standard-bearer for the progressive left. But it also unnerved supporters of Mr. Sanders, who criticized the endorsement process.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that within the party of special interests, three young-ish women are choosing to endorse an old white man instead of a 70-year-old white woman. The trio is comprised of a Latina American, Palestinian-American, and a Somali refugee. If Pressley joins, she would allow Bernie to run the table as she would be an African-American face with her endorsement.\n\nI await the cries of racism and sexism. Remember when Hillary was running in 2016 and Madeleine Albright said there\u2019s a special place in hell for women who don\u2019t support other women? Elizabeth is on the rise. Biden is fading and Bernie is trying to stop his free fall, especially after his heart attack. We\u2019ll see if this merry band of socialists helps him.", "description": "Socialists hang together", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AOC-laugh.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
