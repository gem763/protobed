Johnson said, citing people\u2019s experiences this past summer, while introducing the bill. \u201cConsumers deserve full transparency when making their travel plans. They should be able to enjoy their vacations without being ripped off and financially burdened with almost twice as much as the room that had been advertised,\u201d she added.\n\nSome economists and consumer advocates note that resort fees allow the hotels to grab your attention by offering deceptively low or \u201cteaser\u201d nightly rates. Secondly, they make it harder and more time consuming to shop around for deals: You may have to click through several web pages to find the true cost of each room. Thirdly, the inattentive traveler often misses them.\n\nResort fees are typically not optional. Mandatory hotel fees increased 11% over the 12 months to July 2018 and the number of hotels including such fees increased by 14% over the same period, according to data from ResortFeeChecker.com, a website that tracks these fees.\n\nSee also: Booking.com is cracking down on \u2018resort fees\u2019 rarely included in hotel room rates\n\nThe industry\u2019s trade group defended the fees. \u201cWhen resort fees are applied, they are clearly and prominently displayed by hotel websites prior to the end of the booking process, in accordance with guidance issued by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission,\u201d Brian Crawford, the association\u2019s executive vice president of government affairs, commented in a printed statement.\n\n\u201cHotels strive to create memorable experiences for all guests,\u201d he said. \u201cAll online lodging advertisers, including third-party online travel agencies and short-term rental platforms, should be held to the same standards of transparency,\u201d he added.\n\nThe American Gaming Association, which represents casinos, said the industry adheres to federal guidelines. \u201cThe Federal Trade Commission closely examined pricing disclosure practices in 2012 and issued thoughtful guidance that has benefited travelers, brought additional transparency to the marketplace, and has the full backing of the casino-resort industry,\u201d said Chris Cylke, the senior vice president of government relations, in another written statement.\n\nMembers, he added, offer \u201cprominent, clear, and repeated disclosure of resort fees throughout the booking process with all fees included in the total price.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Marriott facing lawsuit over \u2018deceptive\u2019 resort fees that allegedly harm consumers\n\nConsumer advocates say resort fees are still unclear to many travelers. If, for example, a hotel room is advertised on a website for \u201c$299 a night,\u201d but there is a mandatory $50 \u201cresort fee\u201d in addition, they say the advertised rate should be $349.\n\nA Saturday night at the famous Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas next month will cost $429, the hotel\u2019s website says. That does not include a $51.02 resort fee, which would bring the actual cost to $536 a night. (MGM Resorts MGM, -1.94% , which owns the hotel, declined to comment.)\n\nThe InterContinential New York Barclay in Manhattan charges a $34.43 resort fee on top of its nightly rate, which recently was $288. (IHG Hotels did not immediately respond to requests for comment.)\n\nThe hotel industry employs 221 lobbyists in Washington, according to the independent Center for Responsive Politics. In 2016, the last presidential election year, campaign donations from the hotel and casino industries ($26 million and $38 million, respectively) were about as much as the donations from defense contractors ($31 million). The lobbyists employed (221 and 299) compare with 625 lobbyists employed by defense contractors, and 205 employed by the airlines.\n\nLast year, travel writer Christopher Elliott cited a report by ResortFeeChecker.com noting that resort fees appear to be more popular in some states.\n\n\u201cFlorida is the unofficial home of the hotel resort fee, with the Sunshine State having the top two cities and four in the top 10. Las Vegas, Honolulu, and New York also have high resort fees,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe most dramatic growth of resort fees took place in the Big Apple, where the number of hotels doubled from last year.\n\n\u201cThat kind of consumer deception, referred to as \u2019drip\u2019 pricing, was nearly outlawed by the Federal Trade Commission a few years ago,\u201d Elliott wrote. \u201cInstead, the government backed down after the presidential election. Meanwhile, the Australian government took the lead in consumer-friendly pricing regulations, requiring that the price you\u2019re quoted is the price you pay.\u201d", "description": "Congress takes aim at the controversial fees, which still take some travelers by surprise.", "authors": ["Brett Arends"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HI517_GuyByP_ZG_20190430103051.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
