Democrat Al Gore became a leading advocate for climate action. McCain\u2019s running mate, Sarah Palin, has made perhaps the biggest recent splash as a conservative media sensation who helped stoke a base that ultimately embraced Trump.\n\nA former aide to Clinton in 2016 went as far as to say many people think she deserves to be on the national stage.\n\n\u201cThere are people who believe she won \u2014 or should have won,\u201d Karen Finney said in the AP article.\n\nFinney said Clinton \u201cis in her own category\u201d and a \u201cglobal figure.\u201d\n\nBut some people aren\u2019t as thrilled with Clinton\u2019s meddling in the 2020 election, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) who didn\u2019t get the Democrat nomination in 2016 but hopes to this election cycle. Sanders shamed Clinton on her recent remarks about Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) being a Russian favorite.\n\nTulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country. People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset. \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) October 21, 2019\n\n\u201cTulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country,\u201d Sanders tweeted on Monday. \u201cPeople can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset.\u201d\n\n\u201cGabbard retorted by calling Clinton \u201cthe queen of warmongers \u2026 and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long,\u201d AP reported.\n\nLarry Cohen, who is a Sanders supporter, praised and then warned Clinton in the AP report.\n\nHillary \u201cput a lifetime into the Democratic Party. She deserves to be heard,\u201d said Cohen, who is also on the Democratic National Committee. \u201cIn this senior leader role she has \u2026 it\u2019s her job to embrace the range of politics within the party and not polarize within it.\u201d\n\nAP reported:\n\nHer scuffle with Gabbard and other recent headlines she\u2019s driven demonstrate that the 71-year-old remains a political lightning rod, just as she\u2019s been through much of the last three decades. The dynamics raise questions about how Clinton and her party can best leverage her strengths and navigate her weaknesses through next November.\n\nNick Merrill, a Clinton spokesman, defended his boss in the AP report.\n\n\u201cThe short of it is that she\u2019s on a book tour and is feeling unconstrained about speaking her mind,\u201d Merrill said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to over-ascribe a strategy about every word she utters, but it\u2019s as simple as that. She\u2019s out there telling the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinney predicts Clinton \u2018will be out on the trail in 2020,\u2019 if not for the nominee, then for \u2018any of the record number of women who will be running\u2019 for other offices,\u201d AP reported.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "Hillary Clinton is wading into the 2020 election and a former aide from her 2016 campaign said she deserves to be on the national stage.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/hillary-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
