But what\u2019s different today is that these brutal crackdowns are being passively accepted and perhaps even tacitly encouraged by the president of the United States,\" Sulzberger wrote in a column in the paper published Tuesday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"To give you a sense of what this retreat looks like on the ground, let me tell you a story I\u2019ve never shared publicly before,\" he added, sharing the story of Declan Walsh, an Irish national employed by the Times in Egypt.\n\n\"Two years ago, we got a call from a United States government official warning us of the imminent arrest of a New York Times reporter based in Egypt named Declan Walsh. Though the news was alarming, the call was actually fairly standard. Over the years, we\u2019ve received countless such warnings from American diplomats, military leaders and national security officials,\" he wrote\n\n\"But this particular call took a surprising and distressing turn. We learned the official was passing along this warning without the knowledge or permission of the Trump administration,\" Sulzberger added. \"Rather than trying to stop the Egyptian government or assist the reporter, the official believed, the Trump administration intended to sit on the information and let the arrest be carried out. The official feared being punished for even alerting us to the danger.\"\n\nSulzberger said that the Times was forced to contact Irish diplomats instead, who quickly arrived to Walsh\u2019s home and ushered him to a plane before an arrest could be made.\n\n\u201cThose of us leading The Times find it hard not to worry, knowing we have colleagues on the ground where war is raging, disease is spreading and conditions deteriorating,\u201d Sulzberger continued. \u201cBut we\u2019ve long taken comfort in knowing that in addition to all our own preparations and all our own safeguards, there has always been another, critical safety net: the United States government, the world\u2019s greatest champion of the free press. Over the last few years, however, something has dramatically changed.\u201d\n\nSulzberger, 39, who took over as Times publisher from his father, Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., in Dec. 2017, has had several public clashes with Trump in recent months.\n\nLast week, Trump ripped the Times repeatedly over a report regarding new allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh Brett Michael KavanaughTrump goes after New York Times, Washington Post: 'They have gone totally CRAZY!!!!' Trump decries whistleblower story as 'another media disaster' The Hill's Morning Report \u2014 Trump's new controversy MORE. The paper's handling of the story, which initially omitted the fact that a new Kavanaugh accuser involved in an alleged incident at Yale more than 30 years ago did not speak to the Times and that her friends say she does not recall it, was also criticized by several news organizations, including The Washington Post, CNN and USA Today.\n\n\"The New York Times is now blaming an editor for the horrible mistake they made in trying to destroy or influence Justice Brett Kavanaugh. It wasn\u2019t the editor, the Times knew everything. They are sick and desperate, losing in so many ways!\" Trump tweeted to his more than 64 million followers.\n\nIn the new op-ed, Sulzberger noted Trump has used the phrase \u201cfake news\u201d more than 600 times on Twitter.\n\n\u201cThe United States has done more than any other country to popularize the idea of free expression and to champion the rights of the free press. The time has come for us to fight for those ideals again,\" Sulzberger concludes.\n\nThe Hill has reached out to the White House for comment.", "description": "New York Times publisher A.G.
