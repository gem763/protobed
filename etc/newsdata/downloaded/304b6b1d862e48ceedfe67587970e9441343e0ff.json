But, of course, happiness doesn\u2019t always follow logic\n\nFormula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton declared rather dramatically on social media this week that he \u2018feels like giving up on everything\u2019.\n\nHe was down in the dumps because \u2018the world is such a mess and people don\u2019t seem to care\u2019.\n\nSuch a sentiment will strike a chord with many of us. Life is a struggle at times even before you start worrying about global poverty, climate change, Brexit, Trump, Syria etc.\n\nBut if a young, healthy, talented multi-millionaire sports idol like Hamilton finds it tough, then it\u2019s even harder for the rest of us.\n\nIt is why it\u2019s worth reminding ourselves that, in reality, life now has never been better. We\u2019re living longer, we can cure or manage diseases that a generation ago were killers, there\u2019s less poverty, we have more food and are better educated than ever before.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to be cheerful. But, of course, happiness doesn\u2019t always follow logic.\n\nThis week we learned what really does make us happy, following the publication of a new study which looked at levels of happiness by analysing millions of documents, books and newspapers going back to 1820.\n\nThe research found that spikes in happiness were sometimes fuelled by increases in income, but in general a big rise was needed to have any noticeable impact. Instead, key increases in happiness tended to coincide with other factors, such as raised levels of hope.\n\nSomewhat counter-intuitively, happiness was surprisingly high during the war years. Yes, people were suffering incredible hardship, stress and the absence or loss of loved ones, but they also felt a tremendous sense of camaraderie and community.\n\nA similar spike in happiness was noted in the Fifties despite the deprivation and grimness of the post-war period. The researchers have put this down to a feeling of hope and collective optimism that we\u2019d come through the worst and now anything was possible.\n\nBy 1978, the nation\u2019s happiness levels had plummeted. Widespread industrial action during the Winter of Discontent contributed to feelings of disappointment and frustration that the aspirations of the Fifties hadn\u2019t been realised \u2014 and this despite the fact income levels were broadly the highest they had ever been.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say economics don\u2019t impact our happiness levels. During periods of economic instability we know there are higher rates of alcoholism and suicide.\n\nBut the key thing to appreciate is that generally our feelings of contentment are not rising at the same rate as our levels of affluence. Numerous studies have shown that what we require for genuine happiness is really quite minimal: enough to eat and drink, somewhere to live, a purpose to life and family and/or friends.\n\nOn an individual level, we know money and status correlate poorly with levels of happiness. It\u2019s not \u2018stuff\u2019 that makes us happy.\n\nFor many years until she died, I used to visit an elderly nun who had once taught me. She had dedicated her life to helping others for more than 60 years.\n\nShe had no possessions, not a single thing of her own. Instead, she lived in a community of sisters and shared everything. She was one of the happiest people I have ever known.\n\nAnd during my time working in palliative care, I never heard anyone on their death bed bemoan their lack of wealth or possessions. But many did wish they\u2019d spent more time with their loved ones \u2014 that\u2019s a valuable life lesson I\u2019ve never forgotten.\n\nEarlier this week, the Mail ran an interview with Alexandra Adams, a 25-year-old medical student set to become the UK\u2019s first blind and deaf doctor.\n\nIt was an awe-inspiring story. Medical school is tough enough, but for Alexandra to manage it with her disabilities \u2014 and having overcome serious gastro-intestinal problems \u2014 puts our everyday grumbles into perspective. Her grit also proves that not all twentysomethings are entitled \u2018snowflakes\u2019. Having overcome such adversity, I think she\u2019ll make a wonderful, empathetic doctor. I wish her all the best in her career.\n\nAlexandra Adams, a 25-year-old medical student set to become the UK\u2019s first blind and deaf doctor\n\nDr Max prescribes...Married to Alzheimer's: A life less ordinary with Tony Booth\n\nActor Tony Booth, father of Cherie Blair, died from Alzheimer\u2019s two years ago and this is a searingly honest account of what it is like caring for someone with dementia. His widow Steph details the frustrations of getting a diagnosis and her fight for proper care and support, which will resonate with the many readers who have written to me. The last chapter, Things I Wish I\u2019d Known, gives some of the best advice to carers I\u2019ve ever read.\n\nPublished by Rider Books, \u00a312.99.\n\nHow to drain the 'food swamps'\n\nDamning research by Unicef has highlighted how hundreds of takeaway shops are turning deprived parts of the UK into \u2018food swamps\u2019, where residents don\u2019t have easy access to fresh, healthy food.\n\nThis is backed up by research that shows children from poor areas are twice as likely to be obese. I\u2019ve seen this for myself when working in a drug addiction clinic in a deprived area of London.\n\nIn an attempt to treat our patients holistically, we started a cookery course. Several weeks in, one of them said that while he liked the idea of eating healthy, home-cooked food, he could not find any of the vegetables required for the recipes in his local shops.\n\nI didn\u2019t believe him, so investigated the shops on the estate where he lived. I was shocked to find there were five takeaways but not one shop selling vegetables.\n\nYes, fresh fruit and vegetables are cheaper than fast food, but only if you can buy them easily\n\nYes, fresh fruit and vegetables are cheaper than fast food, but only if you can buy them easily. There\u2019s a simple solution: councils should limit the number of takeaways in an area and offer subsidised rates to grocers or shops that sell fruit and vegetables.\n\nDon't be scared of these vital NHS tests\n\nUptake of NHS screening, particularly for breast, cervical and bowel cancer, is at an all time low in the UK.\n\nMaking screening more accessible \u2014 lunchtime or weekend appointments, for example \u2014 has been suggested as a way to boost attendance rates.\n\nI welcome such initiatives, but wonder why people in Britain have become so complacent about their health that they won\u2019t bother attending an appointment that could save their lives.\n\nWhy isn\u2019t the population taking advantage of the free tests on offer to diagnose cancer at an early stage?\n\nVarious reasons have been put forward: women are ashamed because they don\u2019t look like their Instagram idols or are anxious about seeing a male doctor; people are frightened of the discomfort or fear of bad news.\n\nThese are pathetic excuses. While medicine is a victim of its own success \u2014 too many believe that a drug or an operation will cure them \u2014 it\u2019s time people started taking responsibility for their health.\n\nIf you are invited for screening, book an appointment. You won\u2019t regret it and it could be life-saving.\n\nMassage and exercise can be more effective than anti-psychotic medication in treating agitation and aggression in dementia patients, according to a fascinating study in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nI\u2019m keen on alternative solutions to the \u2018chemical cosh\u2019 used to sedate such patients. Over the years, I\u2019ve frequently been asked to see patients with \u2018challenging\u2019 behaviour in nursing homes. The over-stretched staff usually wanted a drug solution to the problem. However, this type of medication increases risk of confusion, strokes and falls.\n\nTime and again, I\u2019d discover there was an underlying reason for the agitation \u2014 a tooth abscess, constipation or bed sores. What they needed was pain relief and medical care.\n\nA study by King\u2019s College London some years ago found that even paracetamol was more effective in treating agitation and distress than anti-psychotics. I put it to the test and was astounded. One lady responded so well after taking paracetamol that I stopped her anti-psychotic medication.\n\nSo a cheap painkiller became my first line of treatment for agitation. I\u2019d also like to see massage and exercise prescribed in the same way.", "description": "DR MAX THE MIND DOCTOR: Formula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton declared rather dramatically on social media this week that he 'feels like giving up on everything'.", "authors": ["Dr Max Pemberton For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/00/19907854-0-image-a-93_1571442895543.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
