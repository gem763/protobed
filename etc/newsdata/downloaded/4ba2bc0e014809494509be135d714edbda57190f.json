If you like old-fashioned incandescent light bulbs, you can keep buying them. The Energy Department on Wednesday extended the lifespan of incandescents, which the Obama Administration in its twilight sought to extinguish.\n\nAmong Congress\u2019s dimmer ideas was to create lighting efficiency standards in 2007 that effectively mandated the phase-out of incandescent bulbs. Americans were told higher-efficiency bulbs would save them thousands of dollars and reduce the nation\u2019s carbon emissions. Where have you heard this before?\n\nConventional incandescents have already been supplanted by higher efficiency \u201chalogen\u201d bulbs that are virtually indistinguishable. But the Obama Administration in its waning days sought to ban halogens too and extend efficiency standards to certain incandescent lamps that were exempted by Congress.\n\nThe Trump Administration is proposing to rescind the Obama regulations. \u201cMore stringent standards are not economically justified,\u201d the Energy Department concludes.\n\nWhile high-efficiency lights like LEDs can reduce energy costs, their up-front costs are higher. Depending on the light fixture, consumers may not make up the purchase price for years if at all. The Energy Department calculates that the payback period for halogen infrared lights (which are more efficient than regular halogens) is three times longer than the product life.\n\nThe Trump Administration will allow consumers to do their own cost-benefit analysis including the functional and aesthetic trade-offs. A homeowner in New York where electric costs are among the highest in the country and utilities subsidize efficiency improvements may make a different choice than a renter in Dallas.\n\nLiberal groups are predictably howling that this lighter regulatory touch will increase carbon emissions. But many consumers will probably still replace incandescents with LEDs as they become less expensive and more functional. The price of a 40-watt LED bulb has decreased to $2 from $50 in 2011 as the technology has improved. Consumers can now also adjust the brightness and color of LEDs.\n\nEven the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, which supports giving consumers a choice, says this \u201cwill not impact the market\u2019s continuing, rapid adoption of energy-saving lighting.\u201d At least the Trump Administration is letting there be choice.", "description": "The Energy Department will now allow you to choose your lighting.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104419/social", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
