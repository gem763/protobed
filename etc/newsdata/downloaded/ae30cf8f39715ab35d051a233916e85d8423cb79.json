Whereas in \u2018Goodfellas,\u2019 the first line is, \u2018I always wanted to be a gangster.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe story is told through Wu\u2019s character, who begins working at a club out of economic necessity, only to realize that stripping has its own financial hierarchy. Dancers are often at the bottom; club managers, security and D.J.s can all take a cut. The drug-and-fraud scheme that Lopez\u2019s Ramona concocts \u2014 and the leg-up she offers as a friend \u2014 is a lifeline, especially in the wake of the recession, when the status the women have precariously reached tumbles down. The movie, said Wu, focuses on \u201cthe societal structures they have grown up in and the backgrounds that have given them very few choices of how to survive and flourish in this world.\u201d\n\nAuthenticity mattered. Scafaria and her cast made many visits to strip clubs, and had a stripper as an expert and comfort consultant on set. \u201cShe would say little things like, \u2018The guys say \u201cplease\u201d a lot more,\u2019\u201d Scafaria reported. They shot in an actual club, Show Palace in Long Island City, Queens, where, after an open call, they cast several real-life dancers and a manager.\n\nLopez and Wu committed themselves to the moves, installing stripper poles in their homes to train. Even for Lopez, a lifelong dancer, it was jolting. \u201cI was incredibly nervous,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to be up there, and I had to kind of bare myself \u2014 my soul and my physical body \u2014 in a way that I hadn\u2019t in any other movie.\u201d", "description": "With casting that matched Jennifer Lopez and Constance Wu with Cardi B and Lizzo, the movie is being rushed to theaters. In the guise of a stripper tale, it still takes time to focus on women\u2019s lives.", "authors": ["Melena Ryzik"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/08/arts/08hustlers1/08hustlers1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
