Many observers noted that for viewers watching at home, their exact message was muffled and difficult to discern.\n\nA protester is removed after interrupting the Democratic presidential primary debate in Houston.

Phillip/AP) More\n\nPeople in the room noted that the protesters were urging protection for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), an Obama-era policy that shielded so-called Dreamers from deportation. Trump has repeatedly called the legality of DACA into question, including in a tweet last week.\n\nEarlier in the debate, moderator and Univision anchor Jorge Ramos pressed Biden on deportations during the Obama administration. \u201cAre you prepared to say tonight that you and President Obama made a mistake about deportations. Why should Latinos trust you?\u201d Ramos asked.\n\n\u201cWhat Latinos should look at is comparing [Obama] to the president we have is outrageous,\u201d Biden replied. \u201cWe didn\u2019t lock people up in cages, we didn\u2019t separate families. We didn\u2019t do all of those things.\u201d\n\nThey said, \u201cWe are DACA recipients. Our lives are at risk.\u201d \u2014 Jess Davidson (@DavidsonJess22) September 13, 2019\n\nThe Associated Press fact check deemed Biden\u2019s comment \u201cwrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe \u2018cages\u2019 \u2014 chain-link enclosures inside border facilities where migrants have been temporarily housed, separated by sex and age \u2014 were built and used by the Obama administration,\u201d the AP noted. \u201cThe Trump administration has been using the same facilities as the Obama administration.\u201d\n\nBiden went on to tout the DACA program, which Obama enacted by executive order in 2012.\n\n\u201cNo. 2,\u201d he said, \u201cthis a president who came along with a DACA program. No one had ever done that before.\u201d\n\nRamo said Biden didn\u2019t answer the question. \u201cDid you make a mistake with those deportations?\u201d he reiterated.\n\n\u201cThe president did the best that was able to be done at the time,\u201d Biden responded.\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Protestors interrupted one of the final segments in Thursday night\u2019s Democratic presidential primary debates as ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos asked former Vice President Joe Biden and his fellow candidates a final question on the \u201cmost significant professional setback\u201d they\u2019ve faced.", "authors": ["Kadia Tubman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Y8z9TnvPsazSkCF1iC3CXQ--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/34f0a870-d5d8-11e9-9ebf-6ab0ce499a3d", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
