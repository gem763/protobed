Louise Jasper/Handout via REUTERS\n\nIn a joint declaration, climate scientists, physicists, biologists, engineers and others from at least 20 countries broke with the caution traditionally associated with academia to side with peaceful protesters courting arrest from Amsterdam to Melbourne.\n\nWearing white laboratory coats to symbolize their research credentials, a group of about 20 of the signatories gathered on Saturday to read out the text outside London\u2019s century-old Science Museum in the city\u2019s upmarket Kensington district.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the continued governmental inaction over the climate and ecological crisis now justifies peaceful and non-violent protest and direct action, even if this goes beyond the bounds of the current law,\u201d said Emily Grossman, a science broadcaster with a PhD in molecular biology. She read the declaration on behalf of the group.\n\n\u201cWe therefore support those who are rising up peacefully against governments around the world that are failing to act proportionately to the scale of the crisis,\u201d she said.\n\nThe declaration was coordinated by a group of scientists who support Extinction Rebellion, a civil disobedience campaign that formed in Britain a year ago and has since sparked offshoots in dozens of countries.\n\nThe group launched a fresh wave of international actions on Monday, aiming to get governments to address an ecological crisis caused by climate change and accelerating extinctions of plant and animal species.\n\nA total of 1,307 volunteers had since been arrested at various protests in London by 2030 GMT on Saturday, Extinction Rebellion said. A further 1,463 volunteers have been arrested in the past week in another 20 cities, including Brussels, Amsterdam, New York, Sydney and Toronto, according to the group\u2019s tally. More protests in this latest wave are due in the coming days.\n\nWhile many scientists have shunned overt political debate, fearing that being perceived as activists might undermine their claims to objectivity, the 395 academics who had signed the declaration by 1100 GMT on Sunday chose to defy convention.\n\n\u201cThe urgency of the crisis is now so great that many scientists feel, as humans, that we now have a moral duty to take radical action,\u201d Grossman told Reuters.\n\nOther signatories included several scientists who contributed to the U.N.-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which has produced a series of reports underscoring the urgency of dramatic cuts in carbon emissions.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t allow the role of scientists to be to just write papers and publish them in obscure journals and hope somehow that somebody out there will pay attention,\u201d Julia Steinberger, an ecological economist at the University of Leeds and a lead IPCC author, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cWe need to be rethinking the role of the scientist and engage with how social change happens at a massive and urgent scale,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow science as usual.\u201d\n\nExtinction Rebellion\u2019s flag is a stylized symbol of an hourglass in a circle, and its disruptive tactics include peacefully occupying bridges and roads.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe group has electrified supporters who said they had despaired at the failure of conventional campaigning to spur action. But its success in paralyzing parts of London has also angered critics who complained the movement has inconvenienced thousands of people and diverted police resources.\n\nExtinction Rebellion is aligned with a school strike movement inspired by Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg, which mobilized millions of young people on Sept. 20. It hopes the scientists\u2019 support for the urgency of its message and its embrace of civil disobedience will bolster its legitimacy and draw more volunteers.\n\nThe group said more than half the signatories of the declaration are experts in the fields of climate science and the loss of wildlife. Although British universities and institutes were well represented, signatories also worked in countries including the United States, Australia, Spain and France.", "description": "Almost 400 scientists have endorsed a civil disobedience campaign aimed at forcing governments to take rapid action to tackle climate change, warning that failure could inflict \"incalculable human suffering.\"", "authors": ["Matthew Green", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440410570&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C0I0", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
