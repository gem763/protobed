I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s right but we will go ahead and of course parliament will come back.\u201d\n\nSpeaker John Bercow told reporters the House of Commons would resume its business at 11:30 a.m. local time on Wednesday.\n\nEarlier Brenda Hale, the court\u2019s most senior judge and de facto chairwoman, said the court was bound to conclude the prime minister's advice to Queen Elizabeth II to prorogue parliament \"was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification.\"\n\nThe ruling comes following a three-day hearing at which two appeals were heard.\n\nThe ruling went much further than observers had expected and is a severe blow to Johnson and his team. However, a No. 10 spokesperson said the prime minister would not resign, though added Johnson would fly back from the U.S. Tuesday night after addressing the UN rather than on Wednesday, as planned. He will speak to his Cabinet by phone from New York, the spokesperson said.\n\nThe ruling means parliamentarians will have more opportunity to scrutinize ministers over the government's Brexit plans in the run-up to the U.K.'s current leave date of October 31 but does not in itself change the current timeline. That scrutiny had been curtailed by Johnson's decision to suspend the legislature, prompting howls of protest from opposition MPs and some on his own benches.\n\n\"This court has already concluded that the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect,\" said Hale. \"This means that when the Royal Commissioners walked into the House of Lords it was as if they walked in with a blank sheet of paper. The prorogation was also void and of no effect. Parliament has not been prorogued.\" She stressed that the judgment was unanimous among the 11 judges.\n\nAnnouncing the news to his party's annual conference in Brighton, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the court had decided Johnson \"acted wrongly\" in suspending parliament. \"It demonstrates a contempt for democracy and an abuse of power by him and the Supreme Court therefore passes the baton to the speaker to recall parliament,\" he said.\n\nThe Labour leader moved his speech to his party's annual gathering forward so that opposition MPs could travel back to London to take their seats in the House of Commons. The Conservative conference, due to go ahead next week, is expected to continue as planned, according to a U.K. government official.\n\nSpeaking outside the Supreme Court, Scottish National Party MP Joanna Cherry, who brought one of the cases that judges were ruling on, called the judgment, \"an absolutely momentous decision. The Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that parliament has not been prorogued.\n\n\"This is a huge victory for the rule of law and for democracy,\" she added.\n\nAmber Rudd, the former work and pensions secretary who resigned earlier this month over Johnson\u2019s actions, said the Cabinet had not been shown the legal advice about the suspension, despite personal assurances from the prime minister. \u201cThis is an astonishing moment and I regret that the PM, who entered office with such goodwill, went down this route,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nDelivering the verdict, Hale said the court had decided that judges could rule on the lawfulness of the prime minister\u2019s advice to Queen Elizabeth II given it had \"exercised a supervisory jurisdiction over the lawfulness of acts of the government for centuries.\"\n\nU.K. parliamentary sovereignty would be \"undermined\" if the executive could prevent parliament from exercising its power to make laws \"for as long as it pleased,\" she said.\n\n\"Given this verdict, parliament should be sitting so that we can continue to question the Conservative government on their disastrous Brexit plans\" \u2014 Jo Swinson, Liberal Democrat leader\n\n\"If the prorogation has the effect of frustrating or preventing, without reasonable justification, the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions as a legislature and as the body responsible for the supervision of the executive,\" the decision to advise the monarch to suspend would be \"unlawful,\" she said.\n\nHale said the prorogation had prevented parliament from carrying out its constitutional role for five out of the possible eight weeks between the end of the summer recess and Brexit day on October 31.\n\n\"Proroguing parliament is quite different from parliament going into recess,\" Hale said in her verdict.\n\nThe ruling comes following a three-day hearing at which two appeals were heard: One from campaigner and businesswoman Gina Miller, the second from the government.\n\nMiller was appealing against the English High Court's decision that the suspension was \"purely political\" and not a matter for the courts.\n\nThe government was appealing against the ruling by Scotland's Court of Session, its highest civil court, that the prorogation was \"unlawful\" and had been used to \"stymie\" parliament. The challenge in the Scottish court was brought by a cross-party group of MPs and peers.\n\nLiberal Democrat Leader Jo Swinson, who favors canceling Brexit by revoking Article 50, said Johnson had \u201cagain proven he is not fit to be prime minister.\u201d\n\n\"Given this verdict, parliament should be sitting so that we can continue to question the Conservative government on their disastrous Brexit plans,\u201d she added.\n\nMiller called the result \"a win for parliament sovereignty, the separation of power and the independence of our courts.\"\n\n\"MPs should turn up for work tomorrow and get on with scrutinizing this government,\" she said.\n\nBrexit Party leader Nigel Farage called for the prime minister\u2019s top adviser Dominic Cummings to go. \u201cThe calling of a Queen's Speech and prorogation is the worst political decision ever,\u201d he tweeted.", "description": "\u2018The prorogation was also void and of no effect.
