While it was a much-lauded step for the agency, the milestone also left many wondering why it took so long.\n\nThe answer is different depending on who you ask. During the event, one NASA official insinuated that a woman\u2019s physique makes it difficult to perform spacewalks, which is why more men have traditionally done spacewalks. \u201cThere are some physical reasons that make it harder sometimes for women to do spacewalks,\u201d Ken Bowersox, the acting associate administrator for human exploration at NASA and a former astronaut, said during a press conference on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like playing in the NBA. You know, I\u2019m too short to play in the NBA, and sometimes physical characteristics make a difference in certain activities. And spacewalks are one of those areas where just how your body is built in shape, it makes a difference in how well you can work a suit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese repairs and tasks can be performed by anyone in the astronaut corps, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\nOthers disagree, arguing that height and size don\u2019t matter when you\u2019re in space. In a microgravity environment, the right skills involve meticulous movements and the ability to twist oneself in the proper direction, regardless of physique. The one time a person\u2019s size really does come into play is if they do not have the right suit to accommodate their body.\n\nSpacesuit design has long been biased toward men\u2019s physiques, both due to technological constraints and the fact that NASA preferred male astronauts throughout most of its lifetime. \u201cThese repairs and tasks can be performed by anyone in the astronaut corps, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Dava Newman, the former NASA deputy administrator who is working on a new spacesuit design at MIT, tells The Verge. \u201cThat is if they\u2019re in the right suit.\u201d\n\nThe spacesuits that astronauts work in today are masterful feats of engineering. In essence, these ensembles are spaceships made in the shape of a human body, providing a tiny bubble of Earth\u2019s atmosphere around a person while in space. \u201cA spacesuit has to basically have all the functionality of a spacecraft with as little excess volume as possible, so the crew member can operate within the suit,\u201d Daniel Burbank, a former astronaut and senior technical fellow at Collins Aerospace, which helped to design the suits on the International Space Station, tells The Verge.\n\nOperating one of these suits is tough. A suit needs to be flexible, so that the person wearing the outfit can move their limbs and do the tasks at hand. But at the same time, a suit must be relatively strong to contain the pressurized gas inside it and protect the wearer from the vacuum of space. Most suits are pressurized to around 4 psi with extra oxygen inside. It\u2019s less than one-third the pressure of sea level here on Earth, about 14.7 psi, which would be impossible to move inside a suit.\n\nBut even being able to move against gas pressured to 4 psi does require a certain amount of strength. \u201cWe humans cannot operate on a lower pressure,\u201d Pablo de Le\u00f3n, professor of space studies at the University of North Dakota, where he specializes in spacesuit technology, tells The Verge. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you can say, \u2018well I\u2019ll build a spacesuit where you don\u2019t need any physical effort at all and you\u2019ll be able to operate it.\u2019 You just can\u2019t.\u201d However, the strength required to move within a spacesuit is something that every astronaut trains for, regardless of gender. \u201cThe training is very rigorous so anyone who\u2019s selected in the astronaut corps has what it takes to perform spacewalks,\u201d says Newman. \u201cThe physique is not the issue; they have the capabilities in terms of athletic performance.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe humans cannot operate on a lower pressure.\u201d\n\nNASA\u2019s Bowersox also suggested on Friday that taller people are somehow more capable of doing spacewalks than others, which is why so few women have done them. \u201cWell, there are some things that, you know, if you look at just statistics, women are probably a little bit smaller than men,\u201d said Bowersox. \u201cIt\u2019s a very subtle thing, and you\u2019ll have a larger selection of men with certain amount of strength.\u201d Bowersox also noted that taller people have had easier times during spacewalks, such as repairing the Hubble Space Telescope in orbit around Earth, because they have an easier time reaching around things and getting into crevices. \u201cIf you look at some of the Hubble repair missions and things like that, there\u2019s always a tall person or a tall man or two on the crew,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Newman also disagrees with this assessment, noting there are a wide variety of tasks that need to be accomplished when performing spacewalks, some that are better for smaller people and some that are better for taller ones. \u201cThere are a lot of tight places in a Hubble repair, so actually a smaller person has some advantages in terms of getting into some tight spaces and some tight repairs,\u201d says Newman. \u201cOf course, if you need a large arm-length across and that might be, you know, you might want the crew member that has the largest span. So there\u2019s a lot of tasks to do, but definitely universally no one is... disadvantage.\u201d Newman cites the success of former NASA astronaut Kathryn Thornton, for instance, who was the smallest astronaut to repair the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nPerhaps the fundamental flaw that has hindered women\u2019s abilities to perform spacewalks is a lack of suits that fit them. The current spacesuits on board the ISS were designed in the 1970s, and have stayed more or less the same ever since. The nucleus of each suit is an outer shell that fits around a person\u2019s torso, which holds an electronic box that controls all of the suit\u2019s systems. All the other parts \u2014 like arms, legs, and backpacks \u2014 attach to this shell. And the size of the shell dictates who can wear it.\n\nWhen NASA was deciding which size torsos to make, the agency opted against creating smalls and even extra-smalls. Last week, Bowersox argued that creating a suit that\u2019s bigger makes it easier to maneuver, however Burbank said that technological limitations of the \u201870s were more to blame. The original design of the suits\u2019 control systems were bulky, and weren\u2019t immediately compatible with a smaller torso. \u201cIf you shrink the suit smaller and smaller, you eventually get to the point where that display and control module, which cannot be changed in size, eventually expands across the shoulder width for the crew member,\u201d says Burbank of Collins Aerospace. \u201cSo it would have required a fairly significant redesign to accommodate the smallest of the crew members.\u201d\n\nRather than spend the money to redesign the control module and suits, NASA decided to design the suits bigger \u2014 a decision that was made easier by the fact that most of the astronauts at the time were men and probably taller than the average human. The lack of small-sized suits has had repercussions ever since, precluding some women from participating in spacewalks altogether. Despite last week\u2019s milestone, only 15 women have ever performed spacewalks, compared to more than 200 men.\n\n\u201csometimes the effects of those decisions made back in the \u201870s carry over for decades to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe astronaut population did look a little bit different back then,\u201d Jessica Meir, who participated in the first all-female spacewalk, said in response to a question from The Verge during a press conference. \u201cI think that when people try to understand why we have the system we have \u2014 when you have technology that was developed and hardware that takes a long time to be proven and tested and make its way to spaceflight \u2014 sometimes the effects of those decisions made back in the \u201870s carry over for decades to come.\u201d\n\nNASA is trying to fix its past blunders. Last week, the space agency unveiled a new spacesuit that its astronauts will wear if they land on the surface of the Moon. And thanks to more modular sizing and adjustable shoulder bearings, the suit can supposedly accommodate a large range of body types, \u201cfrom the first percentile female to the 99th percentile male,\u201d according to NASA\u2019s spacesuit designer, Amy Ross. Such a suit will be crucial if NASA plans to land the first woman on the Moon within the next five years, as the agency has repeatedly claimed.\n\nThese suits are still your standard air-pressurized suits, which Newman describes as engineering marvels, but still really hard to move in. That\u2019s why she has been researching a new type of spacesuit altogether, one that provides the necessary atmospheric pressure not with air, but by pressing down on the person\u2019s skin. With the right materials and patterns, the suit would adhere to the wearer\u2019s body, compressing the skin and allowing the person to function normally. The technologies needed to turn this concept into reality haven\u2019t been mature up until now, but if Newman can perfect her prototype, she claims she can cut the weight of a spacesuit almost in half, making it easier for many different types of people to wear.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different design approach fundamentally. Rather than shrinking spacecraft around someone, it\u2019s saying \u2018Oh here\u2019s what the human does and how do we design a suit around the human capabilities?\u2019\u201d says Newman.\n\nWhile these kinds of suits are still many years away from seeing space, Newman makes the argument that it\u2019s our design choices that matter in the end, as they ultimately influence which people can or cannot do things in space. Blaming a person\u2019s physique or gender is the easy way out. \u201cIt\u2019s all an excuse,\u201d says Newman. \u201cMen are definitely not inherently better. We have evidence \u2014 it\u2019s a small numbers because we only have a few females \u2014 but we have no statistical difference in the performance of astronauts between men and women. We just don\u2019t have very many women because we don\u2019t have many suits that fit them.\u201d", "description": "On Friday, NASA celebrated a monumental first in its 61 years of history: a spacewalk performed by two women astronauts \u2014 without any men suited up alongside them.
