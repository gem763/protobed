Media showing sex acts, exposed genitals, and \u201cfemale-presenting\u201d nipples will be hidden.\n\nAll posts that are currently flagged as explicit are now being hidden from view, according to Tumblr, and that includes posts that users are in the process of appealing. In addition to what\u2019s already gone, more adult content is going to be flagged in coming weeks, Tumblr says, and it hopes that the automated tools will be more accurate at picking out what counts as explicit.\n\nTumblr announced the ban on December 3rd to immediate backlash. Users began to mourn the site\u2019s diverse sex positive communities and massive archives of explicit content. Some began to share a guide posted to Github for exporting Tumblr blogs on Windows, while others wrote eulogies for the site.\n\nTumblr is acknowledging users\u2019 reactions while not changing the policies\n\nIn a blog post that went up today, Tumblr apologized to users: \u201cWe are sorry that this has not been an easy transition and we know we can do a better job of explaining what we\u2019re doing.\u201d It said the change would be a slow process that involves \u201cflagging tens of billions of GIFs, videos, and photos.\u201d\n\nMany users also criticized Tumblr\u2019s decision to consider \u201cfemale-presenting nipples\u201d as explicit, while male-presenting nipples were still okay. Some pointed out that in the case of non-binary, genderfluid, or trans individuals, it would be confusing where the line would be drawn on whose nipples would be considered explicit. In its blog post today, Tumblr has added the caveat, \u201cyeah, we know you hate this term,\u201d but maintained the language and distinction.\n\nAfter Tumblr initially announced the ban, users immediately began to see innocuous posts of turtles, dogs, and dolls all flagged as explicit. Photos containing a bit of skin in leather tights or cleavage such as in a Fashion Week show were also flagged, despite not fitting Tumblr\u2019s definition of adult content. Whether these posts are hidden from view today depends on whether users\u2019 appeals were processed in time.\n\n\u201cWe understand and agree that there have been too many wrongfully flagged posts since we announced the policy change,\u201d says Tumblr. But if users don\u2019t appeal their posts, then they\u2019re out of luck. That could also be a problem for popular older accounts, which may not have anyone monitoring them to appeal the overly aggressive moderation.\n\nFlagged content will be hidden, but not deleted, Tumblr emphasized. That will allow posts to be appealed even after they\u2019re removed from public view.\n\nThis is explicit content.

It also reassures bloggers that \u201call appeals will be sent to a real, live human who can make the appropriate call.\u201d\n\nMore clarity was given on Tumblr\u2019s nipple ban, with Tumblr saying nipples would be allowed in depictions of gender-confirmation surgery, breastfeeding, post-mastectomy surgery, and other health-related situations. Nudity in politics, sculptures, and illustrations are likewise allowed. But users will still need to appeal if their posts are misclassified, or they\u2019ll remain hidden.", "description": "Tumblr\u2019s ban on adult content is now in effect and users will begin to see explicit posts disappear from public view.
