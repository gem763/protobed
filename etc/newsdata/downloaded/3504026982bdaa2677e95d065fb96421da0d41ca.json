(Charles Krupa/AP)\n\nHarvard University accepted about $9 million in donations from financier Jeffrey Epstein between 1998 and 2007, according to results of an investigation released Thursday evening by the school\u2019s president.\n\nIn a letter to the campus, Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow said the school rejected a donation offered by Epstein after 2008, the year when Epstein was convicted on sex charges. Bacow wrote that the review has not found gifts accepted after Epstein\u2019s conviction.\n\nHarvard University has been investigating the extent and nature of gifts from Epstein and will redirect some of the money that has not been spent to organizations helping victims of trafficking and sexual assault, Bacow said.\n\n\u201cThe issue of the gifts given to institutions by donors at Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s suggestion, is also one that has emerged in recent days,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand we are looking into this as part of our ongoing review.\u201d\n\n[MIT Media Lab director resigns after new report on hidden ties to Jeffrey Epstein]\n\nOn Thursday, MIT President L. Rafael Reif revealed that senior members of that school\u2019s administration were aware of gifts from Epstein after the financier\u2019s conviction in 2008 and sought to ensure those gifts were anonymous.\n\nEpstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to two felony offenses, including procuring a person under 18 for prostitution. Epstein was arrested in July on new federal charges of sexually abusing dozens of girls in the early 2000s. In August, he was found dead while in federal custody.\n\nThe revelations prompted renewed scrutiny of Epstein\u2019s philanthropy and the sometimes complicated relationships between donors and institutions\n\n[Epstein\u2019s donations to universities reveal a painful truth about philanthropy]\n\nHarvard\u2019s decentralization makes a review more complicated than it would be at some other institutions, Bacow wrote.\n\nMost of the gifts from Epstein were designated for current use on research and education and were spent years ago, Bacow wrote.\n\nThe largest gift, $6.5 million, was given in 2003 for the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics and spent by 2007, according to the university.\n\n[Senior officials at MIT \u2014 including the university\u2019s president \u2014 knew about Epstein donations]\n\nThe ongoing review identified a current-use fund and a gift to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences with an unspent balance of $186,000, Bacow noted, and university officials have decided to donate that amount to funds benefiting victims of trafficking and sexual assault.\n\n\u201cThis is an unusual step for the University,\u201d Bacow wrote, \u201cbut we have decided it is the proper course of action under the circumstances of Epstein\u2019s egregiously repugnant crimes.\u201d\n\nBacow also noted that Stephen Kosslyn, a former faculty member who had benefited from donations from Epstein, designated Epstein as a visiting fellow in the Department of Psychology in 2005, and that they were working to learn more about that appointment.\n\nKosslyn did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cEpstein\u2019s behavior, not just at Harvard, but elsewhere, raises significant questions about how institutions like ours review and vet donors,\u201d Bacow wrote. He said he would convene a group at Harvard to consider how to prevent such situations, and expressed hope that peer institutions could collaborate on solutions.\n\n\u201cJeffrey Epstein\u2019s crimes were repulsive and reprehensible. I profoundly regret Harvard\u2019s past association with him. Conduct such as his has no place in our society. We act today in recognition of that fact \u2026\n\n\u201cHarvard is not perfect, but you have my commitment as president that we will always strive to be better.\u201d", "description": "The university accepted about $9 million in donations from financier Jeffrey Epstein between 1998 and 2007, according to results of an investigation released Thursday evening.", "authors": ["Susan Svrluga", "Reporter Covering Higher Education For The Grade Point Blog", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ziYM7aI6D3S9rZWHp-8yab522m4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UZW5LQESDEI6TFLKRDBJDK24HA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
