The Labour leader is facing a revolt among MPs and senior shadow cabinet figures if he tries to whip them into backing an early election, which requires the support of two-thirds of MPs.\n\nBoris Johnson has goaded Jeremy Corbyn to 'man up' and back a pre-Christmas election \u2013 as Labour descended into civil war over an early poll (Pictured: Mr Johnson at Middleton Primary School)\n\nDowning Street aides said a vote would be tabled 'every day' next week to try to humiliate the Labour leader.\n\nOn a visit to a hospital in Milton Keynes, Mr Johnson said Labour was 'split from top to bottom' on the issue.\n\nHe said: 'We have got Momentum, who are the communists who back part of the Jeremy Corbyn enterprise, saying they want an election. Then you have got loads of MPs led by guys like Keir Starmer and Tom Watson who don't seem to want an election.\n\n'And as far as I can see, at the moment the Labour Party is split from top to bottom, and they can't work out whether or not they're in favour of an election \u2013 which is the thing they're supposed to be campaigning for, for the last three-and-a-half years.' He taunted: 'Man up, let's have an election.'\n\nThe election row raged in Westminster as:\n\nEU leaders failed to agree a Brexit delay, with French president Emmanuel Macron holding out for a short extension to Article 50;\n\nOpposition MPs and ex-Tory rebels plotted to bring back the PM's withdrawal agreement next week, or Theresa May's deal, without government agreement;\n\nDowning Street aides planned a major law and order push as part of an 'ambitious' domestic agenda, only hours after suggesting the Government could go on strike;\n\nSenior government sources predicted that Parliament would pass a 'Benn Act 2' and force a second Brexit delay beyond the end of January if there is not an election in December.\n\nOn Thursday night, Mr Johnson threw down the gauntlet to Mr Corbyn, saying he would give MPs extra time to pass his Brexit deal if MPs voted for an election.\n\nBackbench Labour MPs are viscerally opposed to an early election, fearing a brutal judgment at the hands of Leave voters. Senior Labour figures are understood to be furious at Mr Corbyn after they believed he had agreed to formally reject the election on Wednesday \u2013 but he failed to do so.\n\nOn a visit to a hospital in Milton Keynes, Mr Johnson said Labour was 'split from top to bottom'\n\nAfter EU ambassadors met in Brussels yesterday, 26 countries backed a three-month delay but Mr Macron dug in his heels.\n\nNo10 officials believe the EU will eventually agree to an extension next week with a No Deal exit looming on Halloween. Appearing on ITV's This Morning, Mr Corbyn insisted: 'I've said all along \u2013 take No Deal off the table, and we'll have the election.'\n\nHe said the December 12 date was 'really odd for many reasons'.\n\nMr Corbyn added: 'It's so near to Christmas, it's after universities have ended their terms.'\n\nHowever, he floated the idea of an earlier election. Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott insisted the party was 'prepared'.\n\nLabour MPs and Tory rebels led by Sir Oliver Letwin could seize control of the Commons next week to bring back Mr Johnson's deal \u2013 or even Theresa May's \u2013 and force the Commons to debate Brexit again.\n\nThey floated the idea with Speaker John Bercow this week \u2013 who did not rule it out. If a Brexit Bill reappears it could open the door to the legislation being amended with a customs union or a second referendum.\n\nIn a TV interview, Mr Corbyn claimed the proposed election date was 'odd' \u2013 then suggested he could agree to one a week earlier\n\nOne senior government source said if no election is agreed next week, it would mean not one but two Brexit delays, as there would not be enough time for another election before the predicted January 31 deadline.\n\nMr Johnson is now set to fast-track his law and order agenda after walking away from plans to go on 'strike' if he cannot get a Christmas election.\n\nThe PM is expected to bring sentencing reforms before the Commons ahead of Christmas.\n\nOne ally said they would 'dare Jeremy Corbyn to vote against locking up criminals for longer'. Meanwhile, Scottish Nationalists have denied wanting an early election to avoid it clashing with the trial of the party's former leader Alex Salmond.\n\nMr Salmond faces trial in the New Year over two counts of attempted rape, nine of sexual assault, two of indecent assault and one breach of the peace.\n\nIan Blackford, the SNP leader in Westminster, said it was 'not' a concern, adding: 'Let's have the election as early as possible.'", "description": "The Prime Minister issued the blunt challenge after Jeremy Corbyn came up with a string of excuses for refusing to agree to a snap election on December 12 to resolve the Brexit 'nightmare'.", "authors": ["Jack Doyle", "Larisa Brown For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/01/20203602-0-image-a-19_1572049688229.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
