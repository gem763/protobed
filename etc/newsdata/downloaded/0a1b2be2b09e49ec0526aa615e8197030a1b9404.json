The loss of trade, investment and technical knowledge plus a further fall in the pound will prolong Britain\u2019s low rate of growth until at least 2022.\n\nQ&A What is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)? Show Hide The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is an intergovernmental organisation formed in 1961 to work on global trade and the world economy. It has 36 member countries. Based in Paris, the OECD is best known for the regular economic reports and data it publishes, and for the PISA rankings, which compare academic achievement across nations. It also gathers and publishes large amount of international economic data. Often disparagingly referred to as \u201ca club of rich countries\u201d by the Economist magazine, the organisation has its origins in the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation, set up to administer the post-war Marshall plan for European economic recovery.\n\nLaurence Boone, the OECD\u2019s chief economist, said an agreement to smooth Britain\u2019s exit was important to protect businesses and the economy.\n\n\u201cThe best thing is to avoid a no-deal Brexit and to stay closely aligned to the EU as possible,\u201d she said.\n\nBoone said she was concerned that after two years of heightened uncertainty created by tit-for-tat tariff wars and the Brexit negotiations, the depressed state of the global economy risked becoming permanent.\n\n\u201cThe concern is that with high levels of uncertainty going on for so long that we run the risk of low levels of trade and investment becoming entrenched. And that would leave countries even more exposed to a financial shock,\u201d she said.\n\nGlobal economic growth has peaked, warns OECD Read more\n\nGlobal investment fell to 1% in the second quarter of the year and world trade dropped from an annual rate of expansion of 6% in 2016 to 0.5%[check] in the second quarter.\n\nBoone said the situation was likely to worsen next year if major trading nations, including the US and China, continued to expand the number of goods subject to higher import tariffs.\n\nThe OECD said it expected the UK\u2019s rate of GDP growth to fall to 0.9% from 1%this year, down 0.2 percentage points from its May forecast.\n\nBut she said the UK would experience a contraction with knock-on effect to employment and investment in 2020 without a Brexit deal, though it was difficult to estimate the full extent of the shock without knowing how the Bank of England and the government would react.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nAcross the 19-member eurozone, growth will drop 0.1 percentage points to 1.1%. The US will continue to grow at the fastest rate among developed nations and stave off threats of an imminent recession, though GDP growth is expected to fall from 2.4% this year to 2% next year, the OECD said.\n\nIn May, the OECD said the global economy had stabilised after a rough year marred by trade wars, volatile financial markets and rising il prices. But the gloomier picture painted this week by the OECD reveals a global economy set on downward trend.\n\nBoone urged developed nations to open their wallets to boost infrastructure spending to stave off slowing growth and improve tax incentives for firms to expand and create jobs.\n\nShe praised the Dutch government for outlining a package of measures this week worth 1% of GDP that included extra cash for affordable housing, funds to boost a range of infrastructure projects and plans to replace gas production with renewable energy.", "description": "Respected club forecasts 2020 recession in Britain with EU economy dented by just 0.6%", "authors": ["Phillip Inman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e425c12a8176c51c3c396da0c7a9c13314295b2/0_240_4848_2909/master/4848.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=af666a8778e4c3ad75e76ebf13a2854d", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
