Our #MackinacIsland has been a car free haven forever, a piece of history frozen in time. Tell anyone from MI @VP just drove not 1 but 8 CARS on this island & watch their blood boil. #PureMichigan https://t.co/cjfXcygdzO \u2014 Julia Pulver, RN (@VotePulver) September 22, 2019\n\nRep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan is particularly upset:\n\nDisgusting. I am in such disbelief that this was allowed to happen. This Administration doesn't care about the law (you know, the U.S. Constitution), so it shouldn't surprise me so much that they don't care about our history or traditions. #MackinacIsland https://t.co/jvyMBCakrG \u2014 Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) September 22, 2019\n\nAnd:\n\nBanned for a century people, and here comes the Trump Administration trampling all over it, like they do the U.S. Constitution. This video of the cars driving on our beautiful #MackinacIsland makes my stomach turn. https://t.co/D8yvHN2Xr0 \u2014 Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) September 22, 2019\n\n\u201cProfoundly stupid\u201d story sums it up nicely:\n\nHi, I\u2019m from Northern Michigan and I find this manufactured outrage profoundly stupid. https://t.co/tQqbJfiQRy \u2014 Amelia (@AmeliaHammy) September 22, 2019\n\nCritics are saying Gerald Ford didn\u2019t bring a motorcade with him in 1975:\n\nGerald Ford, 1975, Mackinac Island pic.twitter.com/vSPaw9OMN5 \u2014 Thomas Nigel (@TNigel57) September 21, 2019\n\nBut as the Detroit Free-Press points out, this is not 1975:\n\nAmong the things that have changed since Ford\u2019s visit are the attempt to assassinate him by Lynette \u201cSqueaky\u201d Fromme later that year, the 1981 attempt by John Hinckley Jr. to assassinate President Ronald Reagan, and the 9-11 terror attacks.\n\nPence has been to Mackinac Island before, we we assume this was a security precaution and not because his office didn\u2019t know about the ban or anything like that:\n\nRemember last time a President rode around in a vehicle with no roof? His name was John F. Kennedy. The Vice President will not ride in a carriage because it\u2019s against protocol and dangerous. We will not let our VP be in danger because snowflakes think he shouldn\u2019t ride in a car \u2014 Beau LaFave (@BeauMattLaFave) September 21, 2019\n\nAlso, there are official cars on the island. It\u2019s not totally car-free:\n\nSeriously? There are literally cars on the island all the time. It isn't this snowflake place that faints over the sight of a vehicle. The Secret Service made the call. Why can't Pence visit supporters, wherever they are? \u2014 janet kay (@janetkay2012) September 22, 2019\n\nYou realize that law enforcement has cars and other motorized equipment? And once tourist season is over, lots of other cars/trucks/vans come on the island? But sure, go with this. The Secret Service made the call, not Pence. \u2014 janet kay (@janetkay2012) September 22, 2019\n\nAnd we\u2019ll note that the island is being considered as host for the next G7 summit. Did they think the leaders of all those countries would just get around in horse-drawn buggies?\n\nGrand Hotel, home of the Mackinac Policy Conference, was on the short list for the 2020 G7 Summit. VP Mike Pence is expected to visit @GrandHotelMI next week for the 33rd Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference.
