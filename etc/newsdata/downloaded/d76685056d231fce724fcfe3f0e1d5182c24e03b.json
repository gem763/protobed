This can be a detestable party, yet in its next breath the most uplifting, a soaring then plummeting rollercoaster to observe.\n\nAdmirable visions of all that could be under a Labour government were spelled out in John McDonnell\u2019s radical stream of policies to make bad working lives better. Some working conditions have reverted to brutish pre-union days: the care workers, delivery drivers, warehouse pickers, overworked and underpaid. Ken Loach\u2019s latest harrowing horror movie, Sorry We Missed You, previewed here, is a heartrending depiction of the working wrongs that McDonnell addresses. Shorter working hours and better pay are only part of Labour\u2019s intent to shift the share of income, power and wealth at least back to where it was 40 years ago. Labour\u2019s Green New Deal is a double win, decarbonising energy, insulating homes and bringing green industries to areas in most need of good jobs. From speech to speech, on offer are remedies for the decade of stagnant wages.\n\nBut all this jostles with a self-destructive madness strewing obstacles in its way. Brexit chaos is emblematic of Labour\u2019s failure to focus ferociously on winning. Sometimes the leader and his coterie look as if taking real power comes second to sectarian, internal petty party victories.\n\nMany looked on aghast as Corbyn made the vote a loyalty test: either vote remain, or back your leader, which they did\n\nFor all those yearning for a Labour victory, this year\u2019s conference is a pretty miserable experience. Paranoid determination to cleanse any traces of \u201cBlairism\u201d suggests a party in the grip of panic, not self-confident soon-to-be victors. The plot against Tom Watson was a dismal start. Labour students harmlessly selling printed copies of speeches, as they always do, tell of being shouted at: they have been summarily abolished as insufficiently leader-loyal. Trigger ballots for MPs stir local strife, distracting them from pre-election canvassing, door-knocking local members instead. Fixing slates for internal elections is an undemocratic affront, while failure to stamp out antisemitism is incomprehensible to most: some union interference reeks of an old poison. Obsession here with what would follow a Jeremy Corbyn defeat is in itself a recipe for that defeat.\n\nYet all that is only one side of this high-and-low party. Attending the conference is a good annual reminder of the sheer decency of local Labour people toiling for what they passionately believe \u2013 public servants, volunteers, carers, teachers, union reps and food bank organisers who are the backbone of communities and the party\u2019s backbone, as ever. They bring stories of what a decade of cuts has done to their neighbourhoods, their experience of the effect of benefit cuts and services stripped bare, reminders of how severe austerity has been. They look on the state of the party mostly with despair, whispering fears that Labour in its present state may lose.\n\nMostly remainers, they see local members and voters fleeing to the Greens and Liberal Democrats. Many looked on aghast as Corbyn manoeuvred himself into a lose-lose trap by making the vote over Brexit policy a loyalty test: either the conference voted remain, which would be a slap in the face to his leadership, or else they voted to back their leader. That\u2019s what they did, against the overwhelming wishes of Labour voters and greatly risking the next election.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Attending the conference is a good annual reminder of the sheer decency of local Labour people toiling for what they passionately believe.\u2019 Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Reuters\n\nMost know the truth of the YouGov poll for the People\u2019s Vote campaign that found 72% of Labour leavers said they would definitely not vote Tory and 48% would not vote for the Brexit party. But only 14% of Labour remain voters said they would definitely not vote Lib Dem. Fear of Labour losing millions of voters to leave parties is exaggerated; the greater risk is losing remain votes to the Lib Dems and the Greens.\n\nThe spitting attacks on Lib Dems in every speech here won\u2019t stop that flight. Better by far to look at the facts: Labour\u2019s best hope of beating off Boris Johnson is by uniting parties in revulsion against the prospect of five years of his government. Tactical voting by anti-Tory forces requires less mutual enmity from both Jo Swinson and Labour, urging their voters to follow advice that will be widely disseminated in the 100 key marginals by a People\u2019s Vote vote-swap campaign. That could deny the Tories as many as 60 seats. That would make Labour the largest party, to some degree sustained by Lib Dems, SNP, Greens and others.\n\nThis election will transform Britain \u2013 its impact will last decades | Tom Kibasi Read more\n\nThat\u2019s the prize. Johnson ought to be the most beatable proposition Labour has ever faced, banishing some of his party\u2019s best people, ignoring the climate crisis and threatening to abolish all the \u201cnannying\u201d regulations he always mocked. He will promise tempting tax cuts plus lavish spending, a fantasy financier. Labour will offer far greater spending, but with tax rises for which they need to make a strong case. Lose the election this time and the case for tax not as a burden but as a price for civilisation will be lost for a long while. That\u2019s why Labour\u2019s manifesto has to be a watertight and best-costed case for repairing the decade of damage.\n\nBrexit is only a manifestation of Labour\u2019s woes, a party in transition. Trying to hold on to former Labour voters, now Brexiters, is a backward-looking cause. Labour has become far more progressive than it was, in tune with changing times and a younger generation \u2013 socially liberal, feminist, multicultural, pro-LGBT, open, internationalist and deeply determined to confront the climate crisis. That\u2019s where most of its support now lies, where the future lies, why its supporters are remainers. That\u2019s why its leadership has made a grave mistake in demanding the party stays firmly rooted on the fence.\n\n\u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist", "description": "The vote against remain at party conference will bitterly disappoint members, says Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee", "authors": ["Polly Toynbee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3e8b35b8099c476a64f0c60ae72e22879e4c51a/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=680b260b20d38733973d418209961718", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
