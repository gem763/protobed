He worked hard. Got a lot of respect for my brother. Obviously, disappointed for him getting fired.\n\n\u201cMy dad's been fired. I've been fired. Jay's been fired and ... welcome to the club, bro.\u201d\n\nJay Gruden was in the middle of his sixth season with the Redskins. Washington had only been to the playoffs one time during Gruden's tenure and never won more than nine games in the regular season.\n\nWashington was 4-12 during Gruden's first season before improving to 9-7 in 2015 and 8-7-1 in 2016. But the team appeared to be moving backward the past two years, finishing 7-9 in each season before the nightmare start to 2019.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO 49ERS' DJ JONES PROPOSES TO GIRLFRIEND BEFORE BLOWOUT WIN OVER THE CLEVELAND BROWNS\n\nAfter Sunday\u2019s loss to the New England Patriots, Gruden offered some gallows humor when addressing his job security.\n\n\u201cIf the key works on Monday, I\u2019ll keep working,\u201d he told reporters, according to The Washington Post.\n\nA stinging critique of the team's coaching from veteran running back Adrian Peterson in the aftermath of Sunday's loss also indicated Gruden's departure was probably coming sooner rather than later.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that something has to change,\u201d Peterson told The Post. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing you do know, because we are 0-5. We haven\u2019t won. We haven\u2019t been productive as an offense.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nHe added: \u201cYou got to go back to the drawing board and say, \u2018Okay, as a coaching staff...what can we do better to put our players in better position to be productive as an offense, to be better as a defense?\u2019 It\u2019s their job to do that. We 0-5. What we\u2019ve been doing, obviously, isn\u2019t working.\u201d\n\nAssistant head coach Bill Callahan, who succeeded Jon Gruden as Raiders coach in 2002, was named interim head coach of the Redskins.", "description": "Oakland Raiders head coach Jon Gruden expressed disappointment Tuesday when talking about his younger brother\u2019s firing from the Washington Redskins in the middle of his sixth season.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
