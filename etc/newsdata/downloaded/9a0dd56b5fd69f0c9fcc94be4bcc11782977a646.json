So I decided to draw it!\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe inspo from Google, however, stemmed an amazing design, which was created using a \u00a32.35 ruler and some Homebase tester pots at \u00a35 each.\n\nSonia started off by drawing out her design (Picture: Sonia Sibley)\n\nAs Sonia began to draw the outline, she says sh was \u2018scared at how it would turn out\u2019.\n\nHer hard work \u2013 done during the day when Vinny was at school with Sonia working nights \u2013 paid off, though, and the finish looks amazing.\n\nFor there, it was all about the added extras.\n\nThe finished paintwork (Picture: Sonia Sibley)\n\n\u2018I bought the bedding and rug off eBay for \u00a321 and got the cushions from a reuse centre for \u00a32,\u2019 says Sonia.\n\n\u2018I then got his lamp, throw, lampshade and plant for \u00a324 at B&M, and his clothes rack was \u00a312 from Screwfix to put all his fancy dress items on.\u2019\n\nSome bargain Batman items finished off the look (Picture: Sonia Sibley)\n\nThat total is actually \u00a366.35, which is a steal given how much fun Vinny will be having in his brand new abode.\n\nSonia is still modest, though She says: \u2018I know it\u2019s not perfect but it was cheap and every time he now goes into his room he will always know that mummy drew his Batman and it was done with love.\n\n\u2018When Vinnie first saw the room he literally lit up the room with his smile and said \u2018Mummy, I love it and I love you\u2019.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what\u2019s Sonia\u2019s top tip?.. \u2018If you draw something in your mind and it looks good then go for it, as you have nothing to lose!\n\n\u2018Why spend lots of money when you can do things with time and love?\u2019\n\nMORE: What I Own: Jade, a 26-year-old blogger who saved a \u00a327,000 deposit for a two-bedroom flat in Harlow\n\nMORE: Ikea is hosting a Christmas buffet in December and yes, there will be meatballs\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "This UK mum redecorated her son's room, in an amazing Batman transformation that only cost her \u00a366 in total.", "authors": ["Jessica Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_90676029_1571502235.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
