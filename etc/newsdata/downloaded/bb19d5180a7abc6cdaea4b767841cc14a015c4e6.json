(AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe Islamic State released an audio recording Monday that purportedly features its fugitive leader exhorting followers to carry out attacks where they can, striking security forces and storming prisons and camps where the militant group\u2019s adherents now languish.\n\nIn the half-hour recording, released by the group\u2019s al-Furqan media wing, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi praised what he described as \u201cdaily operations\u201d across \u201cdifferent fronts\u201d spanning the Middle East, Africa and Asia. The provenance of the recording is not known, though its authenticity was not immediately questioned.\n\nSince losing control of its self-proclaimed caliphate, which spanned parts of Syria and Iraq, the Islamic State has slipped back to its guerrilla roots: Sleeper cells lie low and strike when they can. Crude bombs target security forces. Places of worship are singled out for mass-casualty attacks.\n\nBaghdadi is one of the world\u2019s most wanted men, having eluded a global coalition of states for more than five years and inspiring attacks around the globe. The United States is offering $25 million for credible information about his whereabouts.\n\nIn the audio recording, Baghdadi urged supporters to \u201cteach\u201d Muslims about the Islamic State\u2019s struggle and not to forget the followers who held out until the caliphate\u2019s final weeks, before U.S.-backed forces trucked them to detention facilities and displacement camps.\n\n\u201cAs for the worst and most important matter \u2014 the prisons, the prisons, oh soldiers of the caliphate,\u201d Baghdadi said. \u201cYour brothers and sisters, do your utmost to free them and tear down the walls restricting them.\u201d\n\nTens of thousands of foreigners traveled to Iraq and Syria at the caliphate\u2019s height, featuring prominently in the group\u2019s propaganda as international fighters rolled into its territory. Thousands of the men are now in the custody of Iraqi authorities or U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in Syria.\n\nTens of thousands more Syrian, Iraqi and third-country nationals are also penned into Syria\u2019s sprawling northeastern displacement camp of al-Hol.\n\n\u201cDo not hesitate to pay ransom if you cannot free them by force, and attack their butchers,\u201d Baghdadi said.\n\nThat focus on captives was consistent with the Islamic State\u2019s long-standing attempts to cast itself as a protector of oppressed Sunni Muslims, experts said.\n\n\u201cReleasing prisoners has always been a focus of ISIS throughout its history, for two reasons,\u201d said Hassan Hassan, an expert on the group at the Washington-based Center for Global Policy. \u201cOne is that these are loyal and die-hard fighters. Another is to emphasize how the group will care about its members even when they\u2019re captured, and that it won\u2019t abandon them.\u201d\n\nIn Iraq, prison conditions are deteriorating after facilities were flooded by more than 17,000 men and women charged with terrorism offenses, according to judicial records.\n\nHundreds have been sentenced to death.\n\nCamps such as al-Hol in Syria have also become a cauldron of anger and frustration. Aid workers and security officials say that the camp\u2019s most radical elements are policing the behavior of others there, punishing women who break the group\u2019s strict social code and attacking security guards on patrol.\n\nOn Monday, the International Rescue Committee described child mortality rates there as \u201cstaggering,\u201d saying that at least 339 children had died there since December. Many are under 5 and had known no life outside the Islamic State.\n\nSpeeches by Baghdadi have been rare for most of the Islamic State\u2019s five-year existence. A video released in April provided the first visual proof in years that the group\u2019s \u201ccaliph\u201d was alive, after repeated rumors that he had been wounded or killed by U.S. airstrikes.\n\nAlthough the group no longer has the revenue or power that came with a sweeping self-declared state, it now counts on dozens of smaller franchises to continue its legacy. On Monday\u2019s recording, Baghdadi listed them: \u201cFrom [Afghanistan] to Iraq to Yemen, to Somalia to western and central Africa, eastern Asia, northern Africa,\u201d he said. \u201cSacrifice your lives if you have to.\n\n\u201cRevenge the torture.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAt a sprawling tent camp in Syria, ISIS women impose a brutal rule\n\nHundreds of Islamic State militants are slipping back into Iraq. Their fight isn\u2019t over.\n\nThe \u2018caliphate\u2019 is no more. But the Islamic State isn\u2019t finished yet.\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "\u201cRelease your brothers,\u201d the fugitive Islamic State leader says in the 30-minute audio recording.", "authors": ["Louisa Loveluck", "Reporter In The Washington Post'S Beirut Bureau", "Focusing On Syria.", "Mustafa Salim", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/y7plCztKVvMOtO2Bi-yRCjf1vVI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LF65NLGYXYI6TJUIGA3JH62LBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
