We despise the ideology, we despise the activity, but we never despise the individual.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis introduction to white supremacy coincided with a passion for punk music gained while studying at a British boarding school where they \u2018beat the grades into him\u2019.\n\nA disciplinarian education and walking in on his father with another woman at 11 made him feel \u2018betrayed\u2019 by all the authority figures in his life.\n\nToddler suffered fatal sexual assault after mother left her in motel room with friend\n\nHe added: \u2018The anger and defiance of the punk scene matched what I was feeling inside.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve never felt so powerless as when I was getting caned in the office. I moved on to bands like Skrewdriver with decidedly racist music.\u201d\n\nTony later became best friends with a pair of skinheads who spotted him waiting in his Dr Martens boots outside a Black Flag concert in Vancouver.\n\nHe embraced their lifestyle of street violence, and at 17, he joined his thug friends throwing stones at a gay man.\n\nKnowing Vancouver\u2019s aquatic centre was a popular spot for men looking for sex, they sat drinking on a bench nearby throwing empty beer cans at passers-by.\n\nHe embraced the bomber jacket and combat trousers look as he got more and more involved with the skinhead movement (Picture: SWNS)\n\nOne told them to get lost and the group chased him through a car park and into a construction site.\n\nUnable to teach the man, the group \u2018picked up stones and skipped them into the darkness\u2019, listening to their target \u2018scream out in pain\u2019 with every third or fourth stone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTony became the leader of the White Aryan Resistance in Canada at the age of 20 and wholeheartedly embraced its racist manifesto.\n\nBaby among six killed during Syrian mortar fire on Turkish border towns\n\nIt was the country\u2019s largest skinhead movement, with 13 chapters and hundreds of members.\n\nHe says it was a \u2018very white revolutionary group\u2019 which stockpiled weapons and wanted to establish a \u2018whites-only homeland with the repatriation of all non-whites from Canada\u2019.\n\nTony added: \u2018I believed the source of Canada\u2019s racial problems was being orchestrated by a cabal of international jews. Anti-Semitism was at the forefront of the ideology.\u2019\n\nThe movement gave Tony a sense of purpose and belonging with a group of friends who would back him up.\n\nHe added: \u2018We drank heavily, we got into fights all the time. I had guys behind me that would bleed for me. There was an excitement and an adrenaline rush.\u2019\n\nBy 1990 he traded his black combat pants, bomber jackets and black boots for a suit and a tie.\n\nTony, 52, with fiancee Rhiannon, 39, who he met after ditching his neo-Nazi ideology (Picture: SWNS)\n\nHe changed his look for interviews and television appearances to create a broader attraction and make the message \u2018seem more respectable\u2019.\n\nIn 1991 Tony set up a neo-Nazi hotline called Canadian Liberty Net, which spewed out automatic racist messages.\n\nUsers could press numbers for different phrases about immigration, Jews and non-white people.\n\nThe voicemail system was prosecuted twice for spreading hate speech.\n\nBut undeterred by a court injunction to shut the phone line down, he moved it to Washington state instead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was sentenced to three months in prison but only ended up serving two days in jail.\n\nHaving two children with a skinhead he met through the movement proved to be a turning point for Tony.\n\nThe birth of the couple\u2019s daughter Christina, now 28, in 1991 and his son, Pearse, now 27, a year later made him reevaluate his white supremacist beliefs.\n\nHe added: \u2018Being in the delivery room, holding this fragile baby girl and watching as she opened her eyes for the first time changed me.\n\n\u2018I was responsible for this person and with the life I was leading I thought I would be dead or in jail as a white revolutionary by the time I was 30.\n\nTony raised the children as a single parent and left the White Aryan Resistance in 1998.\n\nBy the early 2000s he started to feel more at ease with the idea of mixing with people of other other ethnicities.\n\nThe happy couple plan to tie the knot in 2021 (Picture: SWNS)\n\nHe said: \u2018If I was with a group of people and one of them wasn\u2019t white, it wasn\u2019t a big deal to me.\n\n\u2018The more time I spent away from white supremacists, the racist beliefs died on the vine.\u2019\n\nHe said most skinheads succumb to addition when they cut ties with a white power group and is thankful he left the group in a healthy way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTony added: \u2018One of the hardest parts when we join an extremist group is to separate from our friends and family.\n\n\u2018Then we have to separate again when we leave and we are in the void \u2013 with no social circle at all.\n\n\u2018The loneliness of the void can often seem more painful than the dysfunction of the group.\n\n\u2018Most white supremacists I knew have left the movement but they have gone into addiction or violent criminal lifestyles.\u2019\n\nPower-crazed white wannabe cop killed black shopper for using disabled parking spot\n\nIn 2004 Tony became a financial adviser and started attending personal growth workshops, one of which he met his fiancee Rhiannon at in 2012.\n\nAs he walked to road towards a normal life, Tony attended therapy sessions with a counselor who happened to be Jewish.\n\nHe found it \u2018incredibly powerful\u2019 how he \u2018once advocated for the annihilation of him and his people\u2019 but received compassion in return.\n\nTony co-founded Life After Hate in 2010, which was originally a website for people to share stories about leaving extremist groups.\n\nTony speaking at an event as co-founder of Life After Hate (Picture: SWNS)\n\nBut it soon evolved into an outreach service for individuals cutting ties with hate groups or their concerned family members and loved ones.\n\nHe believes it has helped more than 400 people disengage with extremist groups.\n\nTony said: \u2018We have trained counsellors. We try to listen to these people who often have legitimate grievances which have never been listened to.\n\n\u2018We create a non-judgemental space where a person can be vulnerable. By listening, it doesn\u2019t mean that we accept their views.\u2019\n\nHe said 300 people contacted Life After Hate in the aftermath of the Charlottesville white supremacy rally, which resulted in the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer.\n\nHe has written a book, A Cure for Hate, about his journey from from white supremacy to helping people escape its clutches.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
