She took the rare step of testifying in her own defence during her trial, tearfully expressing regret for shooting Jean but saying she had believed her life was in danger when she pulled the trigger.\n\n\"I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. I have to live with this every single day,\" Guyger told the jury of eight women and four men.\n\nIn cross-examination, Assistant District Attorney Jason Hermus asked her, \"When you shot him twice, you intended to kill him, didn't you?\"\n\n\"I did,\" Guyger responded, in a calm voice.\n\nProsecutors also argued that Guyger did little to help Jean even after realising her mistake, calling the 911 emergency phone number for an ambulance but not administering first aid.\n\nHermus also told the jury that Guyger missed blatant clues that she was not in her own apartment - including the smell of marijuana smoke - because she was distracted after a 16-minute phone conversation on her commute with her former police partner. Guyger testified that the call was related to work.\n\nAfter the shooting, many said the incident represented another case of a white officer shooting an unarmed black man.\n\nIn her testimony, Guyger told jurors that the shooting \"is not about hate; it's about being scared.\"\n\nNeither prosecutors nor the defence focused on race during the trial.", "description": "Amber Guyger, a white ex-officer, accidentally walked into her neighbour's home and shot him dead as he ate ice cream.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/1/0f1bf02b66e64adb875fcdc10c98102f_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
