Facebook (NASDAQ: ) has launched a public-relations offensive that has sought to put policy makers at ease.\n\nA key concern from some regulators is that Facebook\u2019s ambition would threaten a core government function: monetary policy. The response from central banks has varied from active engagement as in the case of Singapore, to China considering its own equivalent.\n\n\u201cEurope already has enough trouble keeping its own currency stable,\u201d said Patrick Heusser, senior trader at digital assets brokerage firm Crypto Broker AG in Zurich. \u201cEuro-area governments see stablecoins like Libra as a big threat to the stability of the euro because the economically weaker countries in the euro area might have some citizens who believe that it is better to have their money in a stablecoin.\u201d\n\nEuropean Central Bank policy maker Benoit Coeure on Tuesday backed Bank of England Governor Mark Carney\u2019s call for work on an international central-bank digital currency, saying that private stablecoins could challenge the global primacy of the dollar.\n\nDavid Marcus, the Facebook (NASDAQ: ) executive leading the project, posted a series of tweets this week on the same day members of the Libra Association met with regulators convened by a G-7 working group in Switzerland. He argued that creating Libra isn\u2019t the digital equivalent of printing U.S. dollars or minting new euros. The simple existence of Libra, he says, doesn\u2019t create new value.\n\nAmong regulators\u2019 other questions is that the new digital currency will be used by smugglers, drug dealers and terrorists. Another is that the social media giant, which has run afoul of regulators over user data in the past, should not be trusted to handle sensitive financial information. Facebook (NASDAQ: ) has said repeatedly it would be just one of many companies managing the new currency.\n\nTo contact the authors of this story: Raymond Colitt in Berlin at rcolitt@bloomberg.netAlastair Marsh in London at amarsh25@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Hertling at jhertling@bloomberg.net\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "Facebook\u2019s Troubles in Europe Mount as Germany Opposes\u00a0Libra", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picae99ff2ae686e6973d1ca53f92738f1a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
