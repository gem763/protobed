(AP) - Scott Parel shot his second straight 6-under 66 on Saturday for a share of the lead with Tommy Tolles in the Dominion Energy Charity Classic, the first of three tournaments in the PGA Tour Champions\u2019 Charles Schwab Cup playoffs.\n\nParel rebounded from a bogey on the par-4 15th with birdies on the par-5 16th and 18th at The Country Club of Virginia\u2019s James River Course. He won twice last season on the 50-and-over tour.\n\n\u201cThis week, I decided I wasn\u2019t thinking about results at all and I\u2019m just trying to shoot - actually what I\u2019m trying to do is shoot in the 60s every day,\u201d Parel said. \u201cThen if I play better than that and it\u2019s good enough to win, great, and if not, great. I don\u2019t want to put so much pressure on myself to try to win. I\u2019m just going to play the best I can.\u201d\n\nTolles, the first-round leader, shot a 67. He also birdied 16 and 18 after dropping a stroke on 15.\n\n\u201cI really kept the momentum going for the front nine and then the back nine, I showed up,\u201d Tolles said. \u201cI really lost the speed of the greens. I had a very, very simple birdie putt on 10 and I left it 2 feet short. Then on almost every putt from then on out or whatever, I couldn\u2019t get the speed right. I was missing a lot of them. I was either leaving them short or I was powering through the break. But as far as the way I struck the ball, I\u2019m very pleased.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s winless in three seasons on tour and entered the week 59th in the Charles Schwab Cup standings, with the top 54 advancing to the Invesco QQQ Championship on Nov. 1-3 in Thousand Oaks, California.\n\nColin Montgomerie was a stroke back at 11 under after a 67.\n\nBernhard Langer (65), Miguel Angel Jimenez (68) and Retief Goosen (68) were 9 under.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Scott Parel shot his second straight 6-under 66 on Saturday for a share of the lead with Tommy Tolles in the Dominion Energy Charity Classic, the first of three tournaments in the PGA Tour Champions' Charles Schwab Cup playoffs.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
