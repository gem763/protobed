Among them: Don\u2019t retire. And if you must, retire much later than age 65.\n\nIn the interview he explained that the retirement age in Japan was set at 65 years old back when the average life expectancy was 68. Now, people are living much longer \u2013 the average life expectancy in Japan as of 2015 was almost 84 years \u2013 and so they should be retiring much later in life too.\n\nUntil a few months before his death on July 18 in Tokyo, The New York Times reports, Hinohara continued to treat patients, kept an appointment book with space for five more years, and worked up to 18 hours a day. He was 105 years old.\n\n\u201cHe believed that life is all about contribution, so he had this incredible drive to help people, to wake up early in the morning and do something wonderful for other people,\u201d Kawaguchi, who considered Hinohara her mentor, told the BBC. \u201cThis is what was driving him and what kept him living.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe always had today\u2019s goals, tomorrow\u2019s, and the next five years\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\nHinohara\u2019s other guidelines for living well included:\n\nWorry less about eating well or getting more sleep, and have fun. \u201cWe all remember how as children, when we were having fun, we often forgot to eat or sleep. I believe that we can keep that attitude as adults, too. It\u2019s best not to tire the body with too many rules such as lunchtime and bedtime.\u201d\n\nIf you want to live long, don\u2019t be overweight. \u201cFor breakfast I drink coffee, a glass of milk, and some orange juice with a tablespoon of olive oil in it. Olive oil is great for the arteries and keeps my skin healthy. Lunch is milk and a few cookies, or nothing when I am too busy to eat. I never get hungry because I focus on my work. Dinner is veggies, a bit of fish and rice, and, twice a week, 100 grams of lean meat.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t blindly follow what your doctor says. \u201cWhen a doctor recommends you take a test or have some surgery, ask whether the doctor would suggest that his or her spouse or children go through such a procedure. Contrary to popular belief, doctors can\u2019t cure everyone. So why cause unnecessary pain with surgery? I think music and animal therapy can help more than most doctors imagine.\u201d\n\nTo conquer pain, have fun. \u201cPain is mysterious, and having fun is the best way to forget it. If a child has a toothache, and you start playing a game together, he or she immediately forgets the pain. Hospitals must cater to the basic need of patients: We all want to have fun. At St. Luke\u2019s we have music and animal therapies, and art classes.\u201d\n\nAlways take the stairs and carry your own belongings. \u201cI take two stairs at a time, to get my muscles moving.\u201d", "description": "Business Insider - Until a few months before his death at 105, longevity expert Dr. Shigeaki Hinohara worked 18 hours a day..
