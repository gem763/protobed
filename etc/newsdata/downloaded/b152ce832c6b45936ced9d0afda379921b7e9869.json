However, when confronted with this, Kathrada noted: \u201cI don\u2019t think I have ever been a mentor to anyone. I don\u2019t know the man personally,\u201d wrote Bell at the time.\n\nPapers filed in the Cape Town high court on Friday, without going into finer detail, highlight five issues as problematic. These include Surv\u00e9's \"personal relationships\" with Mandela and Kathrada, his role in assisting national and international sporting teams and that he trained as a mahout elephant handler.\n\nIt further states that the accusations and statements carry the \"sting of being disparaging\" and additionally that Surv\u00e9 is \"vain, arrogant and narcissistic\".\n\nAs a result of the article, Surv\u00e9 has \"been damaged in his good name, reputation and standing in the media industry and has suffered damages to the amount of R100m\", the court papers read.\n\n\"I stand by everything I have written,\" Bell told Fin24.\n\nHe said Surv\u00e9 was given the right of reply, but did not respond to detailed questions.\n\nMedia24 will defend the lawsuit.\n\nSurv\u00e9 was not immediately available when called for comment.\n\nRecently, Surv\u00e9 gave testimony before the commission of inquiry into the Public Investment Corporation and its governance involving a controversial investment into AYO Technology Solutions.\n\n\n\nSurv\u00e9's investments came under scrutiny after AYO listed on the JSE in December 2017, with the PIC subscribing to all its available shares for R4.3bn. Sekunjalo holds a 30% stake in AYO via its subsidiary African Equity Empowerment Investments.\n\n*Fin24 is part of 24.com, a division of Media24.", "description": "Dr Iqbal Surv\u00e9 is seeking R100m in damages relating to an article that his lawyers said portrayed him as \"dishonest and a liar\" to boost his \"status and stature\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7223/e969efdad1374f39b68b98cd35df3bca.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-30"}
