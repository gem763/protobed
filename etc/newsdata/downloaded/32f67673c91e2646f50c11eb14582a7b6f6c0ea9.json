(Gage Skidmore)\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg released a campaign ad Monday evening taking aim at Medicare for All, the public health insurance proposal favored by several rival 2020 candidates, and proposing his alternative, \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It.\u201d\n\nThe South Bend, Indiana mayor\u2019s minute-long video, titled \u201cMakes More Sense,\u201d features several political reporters and analysts praising his plan and juxtaposing it with Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All, which would require that roughly 160 million Americans\u2019 surrender their private insurance.\n\n\u201cBernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren believe that we have to force ourselves into Medicare for All, where private insurance is abolished, there are 160 million Americans to get their insurance from their employer,\u201d CNN analyst Joe Lockhart says in a clip included in the ad.\n\nButtigieg is \u201ctrying to focus on choice not infringing on people\u2019s freedom to make that decision voluntarily,\u201d NBC reporter Josh Lederman says in another segment.\n\n\u201cMedicare for All Who Want It is different than Medicare for All because this gives Americans a choice,\u201d Buttigieg said in an additional video that was released concurrent with the ad and explains his proposal. \u201cIf you prefer a public plan like Medicare, like I think most Americans will, you can choose it. But if you prefer to keep your private insurance, you can.\u201d\n\nMedicare for All Who Want It will be a \u201cpublic insurance alternative for everyone, no matter their income\u201d with the goal of making health care \u201cfar more affordable,\u201d according to the explanatory video.\n\nButtigieg also vowed to release a \u201cpolicy series\u201d over the next several months to diagnose problems in the country\u2019s health care system, which is \u201ctoo expensive, too complicated, and too frustrating.\u201d\n\n\u201cI trust Americans to make our own decisions regarding the type of health care that makes the most sense for each of us and our families,\u201d the mayor said.\n\nButtigieg\u2019s ad comes hours before he is set to face off against Warren, Sanders, and other fellow contenders for the Democratic 2020 presidential nomination during Tuesday night\u2019s debate in Ohio hosted by CNN and the New York Times.", "description": "Pete Buttigieg released a campaign ad Monday evening taking aim at Medicare for All, and proposing his alternative, \"Medicare for All Who Want It.\"", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Katherine Timpf", "John Hirschauer", "Andrew C.
