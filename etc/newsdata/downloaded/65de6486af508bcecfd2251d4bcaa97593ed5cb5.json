She will continue working alongside Mr. Knight, the company\u2019s CFO for nearly 16 years, before she takes over as Union Pacific\u2019s new finance chief on Jan. 1.\n\nJennifer Hamann was appointed chief financial officer of Union Pacific Corp. on Thursday.

Net income rose to $1.6 billion during the quarter, up from $1.5 billion in the second quarter of 2018.\n\nUnder its \u201cUnified Plan 2020\u201d operating strategy, Union Pacific closed some hump yards, where freight trains are broken down into separate cars, reassembled and sent to their next destination, as well as expanded train lengths, Ms. Hamann said in an interview Friday.\n\n\u201cWe are going across our network to make [a] detailed analysis,\u201d she said, adding that the company is continuing to look for opportunities to rationalize. Union Pacific idled about 2,300 locomotives as part of the transition plan and is using fewer freight cars to move goods.\n\nMs. Hamann said she is focused on executing against the plan, which is set to help achieve an operating ratio of 55%\u2014an important financial metric describing a company\u2019s operating expenses as a percentage of revenue\u2014and deliver a more reliable service to its customers.\n\n\u201cWe see limited deviation from current initiatives championed by [Rob] Knight, including the push for a 55% operating ratio,\u201d Brian Ossenbeck, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. wrote in a note to clients.\n\nDuring his tenure as CFO, Mr. Knight said he worked on bringing that ratio down. It stood at 87% when he took over as CFO in 2004, the worst in the railroad industry, he said.\n\nIn the second quarter ended June 30, Union Pacific\u2019s operating ratio was 59.6%, an improvement of 3.4 percentage points compared with the prior year period.\n\nBefore the launch of Unified Plan in October 2018, Union Pacific in May 2018 announced changes to its capital structure by increasing its targeted ratio between net debt and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to 2.7 times, up from its historic average of around two times, according to Mr. Knight.\n\nThe company also plans to buy back $20 billion of its own stock through 2020.\n\nMs. Hamann is inheriting a team of around 500 finance staff from Mr. Knight. During the coming months, Ms. Hamann, a former auditor, said she would spend time familiarizing herself with Union Pacific\u2019s accounting group, its real-estate assets and its tax department.\n\n\u201cThe move was not unexpected as Mr. Knight had talked openly about reaching the tail end of his career over the last two years,\u201d Citigroup Inc. analyst Christian Wetherbee wrote in a note to clients. \u201cWe view incoming CFO Jennifer Hamann as a clearly planned successor,\u201d Mr. Wetherbee said.\n\nWrite to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com", "description": "Jennifer Hamann was appointed chief financial officer of the Omaha, Neb.-based railroad on Thursday, succeeding Union Pacific\u2019s longtime finance chief, Rob Knight, who will be retiring at the end of the year.", "authors": ["Nina Trentmann", "Nina.Trentmann Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-111880/social", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
