That\u2019s because natural formulas lack aluminum, the ingredient in conventional antiperspirants that plugs up sweat glands. Aluminum isn\u2019t necessarily harmful \u2014 regarding its rumored link to cancer, the American Cancer Society states, \u201cThere are no strong epidemiologic studies in the medical literature that link breast cancer risk and antiperspirant use, and very little scientific evidence to support this claim.\u201d But many still opt for natural deodorants since, as Doree Shafrir, writer and co-host of the podcast Forever35, explains, they \u201cdon\u2019t block your pores and prevent your body from sweating, they allow \u2018good\u2019 bacteria to flourish so that you eventually become less stinky than before.\u201d In fact, Follain founder and CEO Tara Foley says deodorant is one of the top-selling categories at her shop: \u201cIt\u2019s a place where a lot of people start their clean-beauty journeys.\u201d\n\nWhich brings us to the second most important thing about natural deodorant: Finding one that works for you is a very personal process that will likely involve a fair bit of trial and error. One person\u2019s favorite natural deodorant might not work for someone with more sensitive skin, or a heavier sweater. Many natural deodorants rely on baking soda to absorb moisture, for example, but too much baking soda can cause skin irritation in some people. Since there are lots of factors to consider (do you want a charcoal-based deodorant or one with arrowroot powder? A gel or a cream?), we polled a handful of clean beauty experts to recommend the best for all types of sweaters.\n\nBest overall natural deodorant\n\nUrsa Major Hoppin\u2019 Fresh Deodorant While some natural deodorants can have a gritty feel, Ursa Major has a smooth, gel-like consistency that glides on the skin like a conventional deodorant. Its easy-to-use stick, sweat-absorbing ingredients, and clean, unisex scent makes it a favorite of three of our experts. Jacqueline Jones, natural-beauty writer at the Beauty Proof, calls it a \u201cgame changer\u201d in comparison to other natural deodorants she\u2019s tried that were messy, stain-producing, and otherwise ineffective, and says, \u201cno matter what the weather\u2019s like or how crazy my day gets, the Hoppin\u2019 Fresh deodorant gets the job done without screaming \u2018dirty hippie.\u2019\u201d It offers \u201clong-lasting protection with a pleasing aroma \u2014 peppermint, eucalyptus, and rosemary \u2014 using kaolin [clay], baking soda, and saccharomyces [odor-fighting enzymes] to soak up sweat and bacteria,\u201d according to Oakjoo Lee, merchandising and planning manager for skin care at Credo Beauty, who says it\u2019s especially popular among male customers. It\u2019s also a top seller at Follain, and Foley raves about its earthy, pinewood smell. $18 at Amazon Buy $18 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest extra-strength natural deodorants\n\nLoveFresh Super Strength Deodorant With a double dose of baking soda to keep you dry, this powerful deodorant is Foley\u2019s pick for heavy sweaters. It\u2019s formulated with arrowroot powder, another natural ingredient that helps soak up moisture. She says it\u2019s the best for odor and sweat protection, so it might be one to consider if you\u2019re hesitant about making the switch to a natural deodorant. $24 at Amazon Buy $24 at Follain Buy\n\nMilk + Honey Lavender Tea Tree Extra Strength Deodorant No. 09 As Shafrir says, \u201cThe adjustment period when you switch from using an antiperspirant to a natural deodorant can be rough \u2014 on both yourself and the people around you.\u201d For another option that best mimics an antiperspirant, she likes the extra-strength natural deodorant from Milk + Honey. She says this formula, from the Austin-based brand (that has advertised on her podcast), like LoveFresh, \u201chas arrowroot powder for maximum absorption.\u201d $20 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nBest-smelling natural deodorant\n\nAgent Nateur Holi(man) No 5 Deodorant Without synthetic fragrances, natural deodorants usually get their scents from essential oils, which smell very differently than baby powder\u2013esque traditional deodorants. CAP Beauty co-founders Cindy DiPrima and Kerrilynn Pamer agree that Agent Nateur\u2019s unisex deodorant smells the best of the bunch, with a sophisticated scent that\u2019s far from crunchy. DiParma told us: \u201cThe scent profile is simply gorgeous. With notes of vetiver, sandalwood, cedarwood, and rose, it\u2019s warming, sultry, heart-opening, and most importantly, subtle.\u201d Pamer, who is also CEO of CAP, calls it \u201cmusky, sexy \u2026 complex, and intoxicating.\u201d $21 at Dermstore Buy\n\nBest baking soda\u2013free natural deodorants\n\nMegababe Rosy Pits Daily Deodorant Although baking soda keeps wetness and moisture at bay, it can also be very irritating to some people, sometimes to the point that it turns them off from natural deodorant entirely. Dermatologist Cybele Fishman explains, \u201cBaking soda is highly alkaline, and often causes irritant dermatitis in armpits. I am seeing so many armpit rashes since so many people are changing to natural deodorants, and when we check, there is usually baking soda in them, and when they stop using it, the rash goes away.\u201d As an alternative, she suggests baking soda\u2013free deodorants, and this rose-scented one comes highly recommended by Lara Kaiser, of Shen Beauty. \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing I don\u2019t like about it,\u201d says Kaiser, who found that other natural deodorants were either too greasy or left oily stains on her shirts. She likes that it \u201clasts forever,\u201d describing how one tube lasts her a year even with daily use. Several of our friends at the Cut are fans as well. $18 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nCorpus Third Rose Natural Deodorant Sustainably made and baking soda\u2013free, Corpus deodorant is also popular at Shen Beauty according to Kaiser, who loves the subtly elegant scents. \u201cA lot of my clients have been rebuying,\u201d she says. Lee agrees that it\u2019s \u201csuper chic and sleek\u201d and describes how the \u201clong-lasting water-based formula\u201d contains \u201cnaturally derived enzymes and plant extracts\u201d like rose, mandarin, and cedar root to neutralize body odor. $22 at Credo Beauty Buy $22 at Shen Beauty Buy\n\nBest magnesium-based natural deodorant\n\nBrothers Artisan Oil Magnesium Deodorant - Eucalyptus & Lime Magnesium is another baking-soda alternative that\u2019s more gentle on the skin and still effective for killing odor-causing bacteria. Last year, Jackie Johnson, host of the natural-beauty podcast Natch Beaut, judged natural deodorants at last year\u2019s Indie Beauty Expo and awarded the first-place prize to Brothers Artisan Oil\u2019s magnesium-based deodorant. \u201cIt works extremely well,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re a stink queen, this will cut that for you.\u201d It comes in a handful of scents, but Johnson\u2019s favorite is eucalyptus and lime, which she calls \u201creally light and refreshing, and not overpowering.\u201d It kept her stink-free during a sweaty workout class, but she does add that, like with any natural deodorant, you might have to reapply throughout the day. \u201cGet comfortable with reapplication,\u201d she advises. $24 at Amazon Buy $24 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest (less expensive) magnesium-based natural deodorant\n\nSchmidt's Jasmine Tea Sensitive Skin Deodorant Schmidt\u2019s is one of the biggest names in the natural-deodorant scene (actress and comedian Ana Gasteyer calls it \u201ca unicorn product\u201d), and their sensitive-skin formula replaces baking soda with magnesium. Even though she\u2019s not sensitive to baking soda, Johnson prefers the magnesium versions. \u201cI just think they work better, and I also think the scents are more exciting,\u201d she says. Along with the jasmine-tea scent, she says the rose and black pepper and coconut-pineapple varieties are \u201con point.\u201d $10 at Amazon Buy $8 at Target Buy\n\nBest natural deodorants with charcoal\n\nKaia Naturals The Takesumi Detox Charcoal Deodorant Sakura Blossom As Johnson says, \u201cCharcoal is a hot ingredient,\u201d and some natural-deodorant fans claim it helps ease the transition from using antiperspirants. The hosts of another beauty podcast, Breaking Beauty, gifted her this Takesumi deodorant and told her it\u2019s \u201camazing\u201d for making the switch. \u201cIt draws out toxins from your pores and has an easy glide-on application without white marks,\u201d says Lee, who loves how it goes on clear. \u201cThe scent is beautiful, too,\u201d she adds. $22 at Credo Beauty Buy\n\nRoutine Superstar Deodorant Cream Combined with other powerful ingredients like baking soda, magnesium, and kaolin clay, activated charcoal makes this cream deodorant a strong stink-blocker. \u201cIt provides long-lasting protection and most importantly, it works really well, and the protection it offers is very close to a conventional formula,\u201d according to Lee. Credo co-founder and COO Annie Jackson agrees that \u201cthe charcoal and magnesium in it are supereffective and a little goes a long way.\u201d The only downside is that it\u2019s a cream you have to apply with your fingers, a style once common among natural deodorants that has mostly been replaced by tubes. $30 at Amazon Buy $30 at Credo Beauty Buy\n\nBest natural deodorant cream\n\nSoapwalla Organic Vegan Deodorant Cream $16 (was $19, now 16% off) Despite the rise in tube deodorants, Foley says there\u2019s still a market for cream deodorants in pots. Because natural deodorant often has a balmlike consistency, she explains, rubbing it in helps it absorb deeper into the skin. If you want to give it a try, she says the Soapwalla deodorant is very effective since it \u201ccontains a lot of baking soda, [and] a lot of tea-tree oil,\u201d which is naturally antimicrobial. In an ode to Soapwalla, writer Alice Gregory told us it has \u201cthe efficacy of substances usually formulated for the military.\u201d $16 at Amazon Buy $16 at Follain Buy\n\nBest sweat-activated natural deodorant\n\nType:A Deodorant - The Visionary \u201cSweat-activated\u201d has long been a buzzword in conventional deodorant marketing, with products promising to fire up their sweat-busting power when you need it most, and Type:A brings the concept to the natural-deodorant world. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to smell it or notice it until you start sweating, then you\u2019re gonna smell the scent of the deodorant,\u201d says Foley. Their deodorants, which come in scents like citrus and ocean mint, are packaged in squeezable tubes that you apply directly to the armpit. Lee likes that it \u201cabsorbs instantly and leaves the skin soft.\u201d $14 at Amazon Buy $10 at Follain Buy\n\nBest natural deodorant bar\n\nEthique Eco-Friendly Glow-Solid Deodorant, Lavender & Vanilla Another of Johnson\u2019s favorite from the Indie Beauty Expo (she named it first runner-up), is this natural deodorant bar. Like all the products from Ethique, a woman-owned New Zealand\u2013based brand, it\u2019s totally free of plastic packaging. \u201cIt comes with a little bit of wax paper, and you can hold it in your fingers and rub it on your armpits just like you would a stick of deodorant,\u201d says Johnson. Unlike other solid or crystal deodorants (which experts agree have fallen out of favor thanks to more convenient, newer styles), there\u2019s no need to wet or warm up the bar before applying. Johnson finds the lavender and vanilla scent pleasingly subtle \u201cbut it really helps with odor and sweating.\u201d $18 at Amazon Buy $18 at Amazon Buy\n\nAnd the natural deodorant Strategist editors love\n\nReal Purity Roll-On Deodorant We\u2019d be remiss not to mention this roll-on deodorant from Real Purity, which sparked somewhat of a craze among the Strategist team when editor Alexis Swerdloff reported that she had stopped sweating (along with a handful of her friends) after trying it. One editor after another bought it and reported the same, so we had to investigate. Dermatologists we spoke with suspect the vegetable glycerin in Real Purity absorbs moisture, contributing to the dry feeling. Actress Aubrey Plaza is also a fan: \u201cJudy Greer recommended this to me. She told me it\u2019s the only one that works, and it\u2019s true. I don\u2019t have to reapply. It\u2019s all-natural. It\u2019s light and smells good.\u201d $12 at Amazon Buy $12 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
