Even when it felt impossible, I chose to work harder.\"\n\nThe mom of three posed in front of her house wearing a black bell-sleeved midi dress, cinched her newly-whittled waist with this black laser-cut belt.\n\nSince welcoming her littlest one, Birdie Mae, on March 19, Jessica has only posted a handful of full-body photos. But during the pregnancy, she wasn't shy about showing off her rapidly-growing belly: \"Jess-tation,\" she captioned a bikini photo taken just days before she went into labor.\n\nShe also posted snaps of her ultra-swollen feet and even one of a toilet she accidentally broke. \"Warning... don't lean back on the toilet while pregnant!\" she good-naturedly captioned the image.\n\nJessica and her husband, Eric, are also parents to 6-year-old Ace and 7-year-old Maxwell.\n\n\"I pray in every lifetime I find you and we re-create the beauty of what we have again and again,\" Jessica wrote to her husband on his 40th birthday earlier this month.", "description": "During her third pregnancy, Jessica Simpson 'tipped the scales at 240,' but she's spent the last six months getting back on track.", "authors": ["Jennifer Kline"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/V8kbW8lWS4iJ8hdRLtkagA--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1028x675/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/6741c840-defc-11e9-bebe-ce4bd0d8d955", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
