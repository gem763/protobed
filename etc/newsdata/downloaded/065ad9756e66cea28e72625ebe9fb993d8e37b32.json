This was also the home where Lee committed his last murder in January 1994, that of his sister-in-law, whom he raped before strangling her to death. He was convicted and given a life sentence for that crime.While Lee\u2019s confession may lead to the resolution of these cold cases in Cheongju, it also rocked the single case that police had closed during the 80s murder spree.A 22-year-old man surnamed Yoon was convicted of strangling a 13-year-old girl to death in Hwaseong in 1988, which police said was a copycat case of the nine other murders.He was sentenced to life in prison, though he continued to maintain his innocence. He was released on parole around 2009.At the time of the murder, police pinned Yoon as the likely murderer due to his confession - which he later claimed was forced through torture by police - and forensic tests matching pubic hair found at the crime scene to his.Retired police officers who were responsible for nabbing Yoon continue to insist their methods were reliable and are accusing Lee of lying about this particular murder.None of the new DNA evidence has linked Lee to this case, and police are investigating the reliability of his claim.Police added that they are continuing to verify the veracity of Lee\u2019s remaining murder claims, as well as the 30 or so counts of rape and attempted rape he admitted to in his confession.BY SHIM KYU-SEOK [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
