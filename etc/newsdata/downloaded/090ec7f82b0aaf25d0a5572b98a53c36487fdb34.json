The figure beat the $363 million expected by analysts in a company-gathered consensus.\n\nProfit fell as the company reduced by $80 million the value of large projects in the Power Grids business it is selling to Japan's Hitachi. ABB's revenue fell 3% to $6.9 billion from $7.1 billion, the company said, slightly missing the $6.94 billion expected by analysts.\n\nThe company's results were also hit as ABB trimmed the value of a project to build a power plant in South Africa, taking a bite out of orders, revenues and earnings at its industrial automation division.\n\nChief Executive Peter Voser described the results as \"robust\" as the company faced \"weaker macroeconomic conditions impacting some of our customer markets, above all robotics and automation.\"\n\nABB, whose products are used in factories, electrification projects and transport schemes, said macro economic conditions remained mixed in Europe and China, while the conditions had weakened in the United States.\n\nIts robotics business continued to struggle with orders down 16% as customers in the automotive industry held off buying new machinery. Total U.S. orders fell 1%, while orders for China fell 7%.\n\nDuring the third quarter China's economic growth slowed as the trade war with the U.S. hit factory production in the world's second biggest economy.", "description": "Order intake turned negative in the United States, ABB said, while the downturn in China accelerated.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104296614-GettyImages-123126855.jpg?v=1532563906", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
