Those who think they can make Turkey turn back with these threats are gravely mistaken,\u201d Erdogan said in a televised speech.\n\nFrance and Germany said Saturday that they were suspending arms exports to Turkey over its offensive in Syria against the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG).\n\nTurkey sees the YPG as a terrorist off-shoot of Kurdish rebels in its own territory, but Western powers used the Kurds as the main ground force against the Islamic State group.\n\nErdogan said he spoke with German Chancellor Angela Merkel by phone on Wednesday and raised the issue of the arms embargo.\n\n\u201cI told her to explain it to me. Are we really allies at the heart of NATO, or has the terrorist group (the YPG) been accepted into NATO without my being informed?\u201d he said.\n\nHe also rejected the idea of any mediation between Turkey and the YPG.\n\n\u201cWhen did you see a state sit at the same table with a terror group?\u201d he said.\n\nErdogan said the Turkish military and its Syrian proxies now controlled the border town of Ras al-Ain, while Tal Abyad was being besieged from two directions.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Sunday that threats of sanctions and arms embargoes by Western powers would not stop Turkey's military offensive against Kurdish militants in Syria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/erdogan1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
