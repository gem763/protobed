A public defender entered his pleas for him.\n\nSmith faces charges of murder, sexual assault and evidence tampering in the death of 30-year-old Kathleen Henry.\n\nHer body was found near the highway south of Anchorage Oct. 2. A few days earlier, a woman walking in Anchorage found a memory card titled, \"Homicide at midtown Marriott.\" Police say they found 39 photos and 12 videos on the card. The videos show a man beating and strangling a woman, telling her to die and laughing.\n\nThe man's accent on the tapes helped lead police to Smith, who is from South Africa.", "description": "A man accused of documenting the killing of a woman on a camera memory card has pleaded not guilty.
