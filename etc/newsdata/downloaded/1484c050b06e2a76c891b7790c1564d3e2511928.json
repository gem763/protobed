However, the flu vaccine this year will not be available in nasal spray form anywhere in the country, which means children will have to get a shot.\n\n\"We'll support you through it if you come to one of our clinics,\" said Etches. \"Our nurses are very good at calming children.\"\n\nWidespread vaccine delays\n\nOntario has been grappling with distribution delays for the vaccine, which means some people will have to wait a little longer to get their shot.\n\n\n\nAccording to the province, the issue stems from the World Health Organization taking longer to identify the common influenza strains circulating this year.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the province's busiest children's hospital said it's preparing for heavy patient loads as a result of the pressures to emergency services that the flu season brings.\n\n\n\nIn fact, CHEO said it's not ruling out the possibility of sending some young patients to other hospitals for treatment.", "description": "Dr. Vera Etches, Ottawa's medical officer of health, says three recent lab-confirmed influenza cases mean it's a 'great time' for people to book that flu shot appointment.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5336258.1572040384!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/vera-etches.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
