When you need electricity, let the weights drop down the hole and use the motion to generate power. When you want to store electricity, haul the weights back up to the top again.\n\nSuch a system could be used to store power from renewable sources \u2013 such as solar farms \u2013 for later use, the company says.\n\nIt could also be used to guard an electricity grid from sudden spikes in demand, or an unexpected outage at a major generator. Giant lithium-ion batteries are currently favoured for such applications, but one study suggests a gravity system would cost about half as much as such batteries, while being able to deliver electricity quickly, with full power kicking in within one second.\n\nThat makes such a system potentially attractive in places with lots of sun and a need to guard against unexpected trouble from base-load generators.\n\nIt is also, theoretically, attractive in places that have really deep holes in the ground \u2013 many of the deepest in the world, in fact \u2013 and where those holes are being abandoned.\n\nGravitricity is already in talks with mines in and around Europe, as well as in South Africa, though it has not said which companies it is dealing with, or how soon it expects to have a commercial installation operational. But the company intends to start scaling up from demonstration models in 2020, and has raised nearly 90% of a R4.6 million crowd-funding target to build a 250 kilowatt unit soon.\n\nThis is how Gravitricity plans to turn disused mine shafts into giant backup batteries for electricity grids.\n\n", "description": "Gravitricity's electricity-storage plan relies on weights, winches \u2013\u00a0and really deep holes nobody needs anymore, something South Africa is not short of.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9502/2b0553dca6bb43d9bc8237a4b587875f.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
