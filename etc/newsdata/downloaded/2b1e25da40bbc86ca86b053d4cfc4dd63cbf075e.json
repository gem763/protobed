It was designed to gradually increase the minimum wage for the city\u2019s tipped employees to the same rate for non-tipped workers, whose minimum is slated to reach $15 an hour next July under a local law enacted in 2016. But not all tipped workers, who are paid a minimum of $3.89 an hour now, supported the increase, creating an unexpected schism that led the D.C. City Council to repeal the initiative.\n\n\u201cI still have a hard time getting by on the minimum wage,\u201d said Samantha Cusumano, a D.C. barista. \u201cI get why the servers and bartenders are against this, but they\u2019re forgetting it affects a lot of other people.\u201d\n\nOn one side were those who opposed the repeal, and on the other were servers and others who feared that the increased wage would lower the amount they made in tips, as well as raise costs for restaurants. Some district servers organized to voice their concerns, launching the campaign \u201cSave Our Tips\u201d before the June 2018 vote.\n\nThe more than 2,000 restaurants in Washington employ over 55,000 people \u2014 D.C.\u2019s third-largest group of employees in the private sector. Restaurant owners contend that changes like I-77 will increase their labor costs to a point that could demolish their bottom line.\n\n\u201cThe biggest takeaway over the debate of Initiative 77 is that this really is a bipartisan issue,\u201d said Michael Saltsman of the Employment Policies Institute, a fiscally conservative think tank. He argued that this new financial pressure would force restaurants to close their doors completely or embrace automated technologies \u2014 like tablet computers for ordering \u2014 to reduce labor costs.\n\nA July poll by the Pew Research Center found that two-thirds of Americans favored raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. That same month, the House of Representatives, which flipped to Democratic control after the 2018 midterm elections, passed the Raise the Wage Act to bring the federal minimum wage to $15. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, has publicly said he won\u2019t bring the bill to the floor of his chamber.\n\nComplicating the policy debate is the rising cost of living. The average cost of living in D.C. is 39 percent higher than the national average , making it almost impossible for some tipped workers to earn a living.\n\n\u201cThings change so fast around here,\u201d said Dia King, who relies on tips as a valet driver at an upscale hotel in downtown Washington. \u201cThere\u2019s always something new and interesting and fun to do in D.C. But not all of us can afford it.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/dc/aa/597175614d7384431ce64c4ee709/min-wage.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
