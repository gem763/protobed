Permission came only after other European Union countries agreed to take in some of the asylum seekers on board.\n\nMr. Salvini often let ships dock only after EU countries promised to handle asylum claims.\n\nNongovernmental organizations that rescue asylum seekers from Africa from often unseaworthy boats in the Mediterranean say they face continuing pressure and uncertainty about where they can bring migrants to safety.\n\n\u201cHaving to wait several days to several weeks is not tolerable. We urge for European states to establish an effective, coordinated and predictable mechanism guaranteeing safe ports of disembarkation for people rescued at sea,\u201d Nicola Stalla, search and rescue coordinator on board the Ocean Viking, said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nThe new government is trying to follow a prudent path, said Matteo Villa, a researcher on Mediterranean migration at foreign-affairs think tank ISPI in Milan. \u201cIt wants to show migration right now can be managed, without harsh tones and actions, but it doesn\u2019t want to appear too soft to voters, and it\u2019s pushing for the direct involvement of other European countries.\u201d\n\nItaly is trying to get away from case-by-cass negotiations over which EU countries will take in the asylum seekers and set up a system for dealing with the rescued migrants.\n\nRome has held talks with Berlin, Paris and EU authorities in Brussels in a quest to reach an automatic formula for distributing the migrants among a group of EU countries that agree to participate.\n\nPrevious attempts to automatically distribute Mediterranean migrants around the EU, to reduce the pressure on front-line countries such as Italy, have come to little.\n\nThe 5 Star-Democrat coalition came into power this month after Mr. Salvini brought down his own governing coalition with the 5 Star in August.\n\nMr. Salvini tried to trigger snap elections, which opinion polls indicated he could win. But the 5 Star Movement didn\u2019t want elections at a time when it is doing badly in opinion polls, so it formed a new parliamentary majority with its longtime rivals, the Democrats.\n\nPrime Minister Giuseppe Conte, a nonparty law professor close to the 5 Star, kept his job. It isn\u2019t clear how long the surprise alliance between the mainstream Democrats and the populist 5 Star will survive.\n\nOfficials in both parties say they know they have to deliver results, on immigration and on Italy\u2019s stagnant economy, if they are to avoid losing to Mr. Salvini whenever Italy next holds elections.\n\nWrite to Giovanni Legorano at giovanni.legorano@wsj.com", "description": "Italy allowed a charity ship to bring 82 migrants rescued in the Mediterranean to its shores, in the first test of how the new left-leaning government will handle the divisive issue of migration from Africa.", "authors": ["Giovanni Legorano", "Giovanni.Legorano Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107238/social", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
