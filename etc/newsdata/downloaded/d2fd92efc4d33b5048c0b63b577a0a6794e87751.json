Generally, an ACL for a basketball player is a full-year recovery, and if it\u2019s a full year for Klay, that puts them out for the season. \u201cWe\u2019ve kind of left the door open in case the rehab goes perfectly and the doctors say he can go. But the reality is, on April 1, that\u2019s the nine-month mark. \u2026 April versus nine months post-op for an ACL.\n\nI don\u2019t know when Thompson will return. Kerr doesn\u2019t know when Thompson will return, though Kerr has for information than me. Each injury recovery is unique, and Thompson will heal in his own time.\n\nStill, this is a FAR more reasonable expectation than most prognostications for Thompson. There was a lot of wishful thinking tied into the idea he\u2019d return sooner, usually accompanied by a narrative about him sparking the Warriors to a deep playoff run with Stephen Curry and Draymond Green. ACL tears nearly always sideline players longer than that.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost teams also give high-end estimates for injury absences. That delays potentially distracting questions and makes the player look good if he returns sooner than the announced projection. Golden State might have learned its lesson after doing the opposite with Kevin Durant last postseason.\n\nBut this also sounds more realistic than anything previously coming from the Warriors about Thompson\u2019s injury.", "description": "Warriors general manager Bob Myers and Klay Thompson himself both said Thompson would be out until at least the the All-Star break.", "authors": ["Dan Feldman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/WaCQC3BmGztGQi9csAv3KA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTc5MjtoPTQ0OA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SoMcMyBGJseMCPaxX5tDIA--~B/aD0yMjQ7dz0zOTY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/2f84caef93633f2bf1e4c3b1d89cac25", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
