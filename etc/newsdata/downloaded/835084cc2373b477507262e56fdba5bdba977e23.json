A separate group of demonstrators also burned a ballot box in the middle of the street in the southern city of Tarija.\n\nThree people were reported injured during the clashes, which remain ongoing across nine cities. Morales has called a state of emergency across the country.\n\nSuspicions of vote manipulation emerged on Sunday after the official electoral board, Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE), suddenly halted an electronic quick count for 24 hours as it showed Morales and his opponent Carlos Mesa were likely headed to second round run-off, with 84 percent of the votes tallied.\n\nViolent protests have erupted in at least nine cities in Bolivia, amid ongoing confusion about the result of Sunday's presidential election [Tap to expand] https://t.co/ZGn6Wq4n9S pic.twitter.com/4QrK6tkMfp \u2014 BBC News (World) (@BBCWorld) October 22, 2019\n\nAfter counting resumed, Morales suddenly held a ten-point lead, sparking suspicion from opponents and international election observers about such an irregularity. He has since gone on to claim victory and plans to stay on as leader after nearly 14 years in power.\n\nOpposition candidate Carlos Mesa, who himself comes from the left-wing but anti-Morales party known as the Revolutionary Left Front, joined protesters on Tuesday to demand the restoration of democracy crowds chanted: \u201cNo dictatorship. Yes to democracy. We are not afraid.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, a few meters from us, an enormous fraud is being committed to make us think there won\u2019t be a second-round vote,\u201d Mesa told crowds in reference to the electoral board. \u201cThey\u2019re lying to the country and turning their backs on your vote!\u201d\n\nA mysteriously delayed vote count in Bolivia's presidential election has sparked protests and accusations of fraud.

On Tuesday, Morales met with a delegation of OAS members and European Union officials to discuss the results.\n\n\u201cWe had a very productive meeting with observers, diplomatic delegations and the European Union and the OAS to listen and respond to their concerns,\u201d he wrote on Twitter following the meeting. \u201cWe reiterate the invitation for you to exercise the entire vote calculation process, minute by minute, with all the guarantees.\u201d\n\nTuvimos una reuni\u00f3n muy productiva con observadores, delegaciones diplom\u00e1ticas y de la Uni\u00f3n Europea y la OEA para escuchar y responder a sus preocupaciones. Les reiteramos la invitaci\u00f3n a que fiscalicen todo el proceso de c\u00f3mputo de votos, acta por acta, con todas las garant\u00edas. pic.twitter.com/a1md12HFpE \u2014 Evo Morales Ayma (@evoespueblo) October 22, 2019\n\nThe protests are reminiscent of a similar power struggle taking place in Venezuela, where millions of people have taken to the streets in recent years to protest against the ruling socialist regime. Dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro successfully rigged last year\u2019s presidential elections to stay in power, using the military to keep legitimate President Juan Guaid\u00f3 from being able to exercise his power. A committed socialist and anti-imperialist, Morales maintains strong relations with the Maduro regime, as well as other authoritarian dictatorships including Cuba, Iran, and China.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Anti-socialist protesters in Bolivia set fire to the country's electoral commission headquarters after far-left Evo Morales claimed victory.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/bolivia-protest-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
