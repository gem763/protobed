Of that, 135 billion riyals is earmarked for investment in the logistics sector.\n\nUnder its ambitious reform strategy, the kingdom plans to have the private sector operate much of its transport infrastructure, including airports and sea ports, with the government keeping a role as regulator.\n\nDetails of what the government plans to offer investors in al-Khomra were not disclosed, but the Saudi Ports Authority said the zone would offer opportunities to investors on a lease basis.\n\n\u201cInvestment in the logistics zone in al-Khomra and other ports will total 7 billion Saudi riyals,\u201d said Saad al-Khalb, president of the Saudi Ports Authority, without giving further details.\n\nAl-Khomra joins other logisitics zones in the kingdom - the King Abdullah Economic City north of Jeddah has its own port and offers logisicts investments and NEOM, a mega project announced in 2017, has plans for a logistics zone.\n\nOver a decade ago, Saudi government spent $30 billion to build six economic cities across the kingdom to diversify the economy, create jobs for young Saudis and attract foreign investment, though many of the projects have failed to achieve expected results.\n\nAfter decades of spending on development projects, the government has made attracting greater foreign investment a cornerstone of its Vision 2030 plan.\n\nBut foreign investment has failed to live up to the government\u2019s ambitions, especially after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the hands of Saudi agents in October 2018 strained ties with Western allies.", "description": "Saudi Arabia launched on Sunday a new logistics zone open to private investors in the Red Sea port city of Jeddah, as part of a wider industrial initiative to diversify the economy away from oil and create jobs for Saudis.", "authors": ["Marwa Rashad", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
