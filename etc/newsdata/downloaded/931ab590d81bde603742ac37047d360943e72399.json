He had scored 38 times for Liverpool since the start of the previous season and six months earlier, his goal had ended Spain\u2019s 44-year wait to win an international tournament. And yet, he was uncertain whether he belonged in the same room as the finest footballers on the planet.\n\n\u201cI could not believe I was nominated,\u201d he told Simon Hughes in his book Ring of Fire: Liverpool Into The 21st Century, describing his \u201cshock\u201d that he was deemed important enough to be travelling by private jet. His club captain and friend Steven Gerrard reassured him, insisting that he deserved to win the award. Torres remembered Gerrard\u2019s words, even if he did not quite believe them, adding: \u201cHe told me that like he really thought it.\u201d\n\nCall it imposter syndrome, a Jonah complex or a simple lack of self-esteem \u2013 perhaps any attempt at interpretation is an exercise in cod psychology \u2013 but at the very least, that episode offers us a window on how Torres saw himself when at the absolute peak of his powers. Even then, as a fresh-faced, befreckled goal-scoring phenomenon, he felt unworthy of the acclaim which his performances attracted.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nTorres was not naturally drawn to football. His interest in the game only came about by watching anime series Captain Tsubasa \u2013 titled Oliver y Benji in Spain \u2013 and he has said he only started playing because his brother Israel \u201cforced him\u201d. Even his affection for Atletico Madrid came relatively late. He attended his first game \u2013 a 1-1 draw against Compostela \u2013 with his grandfather Eulalio in 1995, not long before his 11th birthday.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t hooked when I left the stadium,\u201d he admits in his autobiography, recalling that first night at the Vicente Calderon. \u201cIt was cold, there wasn\u2019t much excitement and the flat atmosphere in the stands didn\u2019t help.\u201d But only six years later, he was the club\u2019s greatest hope while at their lowest ebb. With Atletico struggling to recover from relegation to the Segunda Division, Spain\u2019s second tier, Torres was fast-tracked into the first team to placate supporters. The press described as a prodigy, a folk hero, a native son and a messiah. He was 17.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 100-61: Century countdown Show all 41 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

We will be revealing 20 players per day, with the overall winner announced on Friday. 2/41 100. Yaya Toure A brilliant midfielder who had everything: skill, tenacity, power, goals, energy. His defensive capabilities brought him to the fore at Barcelona before his attacking prowess made him such a weapon for Manchester City. He won two Ligas, three Premier Leagues, one Champions League, captained Ivory Coast to the Africa Cup of Nations and was African Player of the Year four times. LO Getty Images 3/41 99. Harry Kane His raw statistics are simply phenomenal. 130 Premier League goals for Tottenham Hotspur, in just 186 appearances. 27 in 42 for England. Twice a Premier League Golden Boot winner. A World Cup Golden Boot winner. Tottenham\u2019s talisman. England\u2019s captain. And still just 26 years old. In 10 years\u2019 time, expect to see Kane in the top 20 of a similar list. LB Getty Images 4/41 98. Daniele De Rossi A ferociously competitive and combative midfield hard man, who made over 600 appearances for his beloved Roma and over 100 for his national team. A complete midfielder, who could in one passage of play win the ball, race forward and either release a team-mate with a pinpoint pass or score himself. And do not be fooled by his combustible reputation: in 2016, he placed his treasured World Cup winner's medal in the coffin of Pietro Lombardi, Italy\u2019s kit man at the tournament. LB AFP/Getty Images 5/41 97. Bastian Schweinsteiger The meticulous German orchestrated Bayern Munich's midfield to eight Bundesliga titles and a Champions League, making over 500 appearances for the club. He was also one of the leaders in Germany's 2014 World Cup-winning campaign and carried an aura in the centre of the pitch few players can claim to have replicated. TK Bongarts/Getty Images 6/41 96. Vincent Kompany It\u2019s difficult to define his importance to both Manchester City and Belgium but it\u2019s safe to say he was one of the most important players of a generation. There may well be a handful of technically better centre-backs but his intangibles were vital to the culture at club and country where there was not a legacy of winning previously. JR Getty Images 7/41 95. Karim Benzema One of the few strikers on this list who can truly claim to be the complete forward, able to play wide or central, deep linking play or on the shoulder of the last defender, with the ability to sniff out scrappy goals and score beauties too. His medal haul speaks for itself, and he is approaching 300 career goals. But for his strained relationship with the French national team, he would have scored even more. LO Getty Images 8/41 94. Sol Campbell The heartbeat of Arsenal's defence in the Invincibles season, a double-winner in 2002 and a mainstay of the England team for almost a decade, Campbell is one of the defining defensive figures of the Premier League era. TK AFP/Getty Images 9/41 93. Pepe One of the great villains of the game but a nasty, hard centre-back that would be very high on any great striker\u2019s list of defenders he least wanted to play against. While his grit and determination stand out, nobody lasts a decade at the Bernabeu without possessing exceptional quality, with three La Liga titles (which has eluded the club since his departure) and as many Champions Leagues, Zinedine Zidane would be wise to acquire a similar player now. JR Getty Images 10/41 92. Edwin van der Sar The four-time Premier League winner made over 300 appearances in England and made an enduring habit of thriving under pressure, winning the man-of-the-match award in Manchester United's Champions League final victory in 2008. TK Getty Images 11/41 91. Arturo Vidal Only the finest players in the world enjoy long and fruitful stints at clubs such as Juventus, Bayern Munich and Barcelona. Il Guerriero has matured into a splendid holding midfielder, aggressive and dominant in the middle of the pitch but equally as effective arriving late into the box to complete attacks. A hero in his native Chile, for his role in the 2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica victory. LB Bongarts/Getty Images 12/41 90. Angel di Maria A key player in the glorious Real Madrid side that won La Liga in 2011/12 and the Champions League two seasons later. Widely considered a flop when he left Manchester United after only one miserable season, but the Argentine completely reinvented himself at Paris Saint-Germain, the starring attraction in one of the most expensive squads ever assembled, containing the likes of Neymar, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Edinson Cavani. LB AFP/Getty Images 13/41 89. Diego Forlan A figure of fun in his early Premier League days at Manchester United, Forlan went on to have the last laugh with a stellar career both internationally with Uruguay and in Spain, where he racked up goals for Villarreal and Atletico Madrid, twice winning the European Golden Shoe. LO AFP/Getty Images 14/41 88. Radamel Falcao In his pomp Falcao was probably the best striker on the planet. In a prolific four-year spell playing for Porto and Atletico Madrid he scored 142 goals in 178 games, and had injuries not hindered his career there is little doubt that Colombia's record scorer would be much higher up this list. LO Getty Images 15/41 87. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang Has excelled in a thoroughly mediocre Arsenal side for two seasons now, scoring at a rate better than a goal every other game in a side that has struggled since the departure of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. But it is primarily for his achievements at Borussia Dortmund that he makes this list. He scored close to 150 Bundesliga goals for that wonderfully attacking team \u2013 including 31 in one season \u2013 winning the Bundesliga Player of the Year and Top Goalscorer awards. There have been few strikers as rapid or as decisive in front of goal in the last two decades. LB Bongarts/Getty Images 16/41 86. Robin Van Persie One of the best left foots in Premier League history graced two of its most revered clubs, becoming a star at both Arsenal and Manchester United. The Dutchman had a penchant for the spectacular but suffered with injuries, and it is a sign of what could have been that in the two Premier League seasons he played more than 30 games, he won the Golden Boot in both. LO Getty Images 17/41 85. Carlos Tevez A real pest of a striker who thrived in the hottest atmospheres and regularly overcame adversity. He scored plenty too, 116 league goals in eight seasons with United, City and Juventus (who probably all enjoyed prime Tevez), but it was the way he would trigger his teammates by forcing the first mistake or sparking counterattacks that really made him such an invaluable player. JR Getty Images 18/41 84. Gaizka Mendieta The midfield maestro could control games and decide them too, and was at the heart of the brilliant Valencia team which reached back-to-back Champions League finals in 2000 and 2001. He became one of the most expensive players of all time when he switched to Lazio, but he would never again reach the heights that made him a legend at the Mestalla. LO Getty Images 19/41 83. Virgil van Dijk The defensive talisman cast a spell of leadership over Liverpool's 2019 Champions League-winning side and went the entire campaign without being dribbled past. Few defenders have carried such an overarching influence on any side in recent memory. TK Getty Images 20/41 82. Hernan Crespo One of the finest finishers of a generation but perhaps his best quality was his movement; particularly in the box, where nobody was more lethal at finding a yard of space and punishing opponents. Strong and an aerial threat, he was perhaps unfortunate to follow Gabriel Batistuta with Argentina, otherwise he would have been appreciated even more. Certainly as talented as Sergio Aguero and with perhaps more composure in the biggest occasions - an underrated player. JR AFP/Getty Images 21/41 81. Rio Ferdinand A gem of a centre-back, who was perhaps ahead of his time, right now he would be even more valuable due to his versatility to thrive under any manager, no matter the philosophy or style of play. Became a real winner and leader at United and formed one of the greatest partnerships in international football history alongside John Terry with England - who should have obviously achieved much more with such an outstanding foundation to their team. JR Getty Images 22/41 80. Toni Kroos A metronome in the middle, one of the finer passers in the world of football and the beating heart of a number of very successful sides, not least the World Cup winning Germany side of 2014. Four Champions League crowns as a key cog for Bayern Munich and Real Madrid underline his quality, but if you are to criticise it is that there have always seemed to be others doing more around him. HLC Getty Images 23/41 79. Juan Roman Riquelme A traditional No 10 who was unhelpfully branded the \u2018new Maradona\u2019 when he began setting the Primeira Division alight with Boca Juniors. His \u00a310m move to Barcelona in 2002 did not exactly go as planned \u2013 with another talented Argentine poised to write himself into club folklore instead \u2013 but Riquelme made a success of himself in Spain with Villarreal under Manuel Pellegrini. A true artist who shone in an advanced playmaker role, before dropping deeper into midfield as his ageing legs lost their pace. LB Getty Images 24/41 78. Thomas Muller Muller has popped up with important goals for Bayern Munich and Germany throughout his career. The gangly forward has scored nearly 250 goals combined for club and country, which has helped Bayern to eight Bundesliga titles and a single Champions League and Club World Cup. Muller will not be the last player to excel with Bayern and Germany, but he may well be the last sort of his type of player, placing the importance of timing and occupying space above all else in the game. KV Bongarts/Getty Images 25/41 77. Mohamed Salah The \u2018Egyptian king\u2019 has turned into one of the most feared forwards in world football since joining Liverpool from Roma in 2017. After a torrid time at Chelsea, Salah\u2019s second spell in England brought about a Premier League history as he netted a record 32 goals in 36 league games. The outright Premier League top scorer in 2018 and the joint winner last season, no longer is anyone laughing at the \u00a335m Liverpool paid for him over two years ago. KV Getty Images 26/41 76. Diego Godin The kind of defender every one wants on their team on one wants to come up against. Godin is tough, utterly committed and completely fearless, and at the peak of his powers when Atletico Madrid won La Liga he was probably the best defender around. LO AFP/Getty Images 27/41 75. David Silva A midfield maestro capable of playing the game at his pace; speeding up and slowing down while painting a picture amid the frantic action in Premier League games. Silva has never been flustered and can always be relied upon to stand up in the most opportune moments, a cornerstone of the Manchester City era and a candidate for their best ever player, despite the money lavished on various other superstars. JR Getty Images 28/41 74. Eden Hazard Such quality in tight spaces and an almost unrivalled ability to dribble at pace, Hazard is capable of true magic, with his best Premier League seasons propelling Chelsea to two titles, and earning . There have been more fallow years, of course, but at his best Hazard has been magnificent, including in helping Lille to Ligue 1 glory in 2010-11. HLC Getty Images 29/41 73. Cesc Fabregas The fulcrum of Arsene Wenger\u2019s side following Arsenal\u2019s move to the Emirates Stadium, Fabregas combined vision with genuine goalscoring ability to establish himself as one of the world\u2019s most well-rounded and exciting midfielders. Trophies commensurate to the playmaker\u2019s ability to precisely pick out forwards\u2019 runs more often that not did not come in north London, but two Premier League titles with Chelsea after his dream move to Barcelona failed to live up to expectation were just rewards for the midfielder. Nevertheless, he still won La Liga and the Copa del Rey while in Spain, and was part of the squads that won the 2008 and 2012 Euros as well as the 2010 World Cup. KV Getty Images 30/41 72. Deco A player at home in any era who blossomed under Jose Mourinho not once but twice. At home at No 10 Deco effortlessly controlled games for Porto and latterly Chelsea as a key cog in two of the Special One's greatest sides. BB Getty Images 31/41 71. Lilian Thuram Enjoyed the best years of his storied career right at the very start of the 21st century, after he moved from Parma to Juventus in a double transfer, along with Gianluigi Buffon. Went on to form a formidable defensive partnership with Igor Tudor as well as Fabio Cannavaro, before a late career swansong at Barcelona. He also won the European Championship with France in 2000. An imperious defender, who now works tirelessly fighting against racism in football and society. LB AFP/Getty Images 32/41 70. Nemanja Vidic Warrior. Tough as any Premier League centre-half, totemic at times and a pillar of consistency for Manchester United. Indomitable in the air, his partnership with Rio Ferdinand is perhaps the best English football has seen this century, contrasting in styles but with an innate understanding of each others\u2019 abilities. Superb leader to boot. HLC Getty Images 33/41 69. Marcelo The Brazilian is well renowned as one of the best attacking fullbacks in world football, and has been one of Real Madrid\u2019s most consistent performers for a number of years. Arriving at the Santiago Bernabeu as a nervous 19-year-old, Marcelo has lived up to his reputation as Roberto Carlos\u2019 successor at both club and international level, as likely to whip a cross in as he is to audaciously hammer one in from outside the penalty area. Often sporting a smile off the field, Marcelo\u2019s trophy record makes for pleasant reading having experienced four consecutive Champions League victories as well as four La Liga and Club World Cup titles. KV AFP/Getty Images 34/41 68. Ryan Giggs While it can be argued his most captivating moments came before the turn of the millennium, Giggs\u2019 longevity was remarkable, never truly fading from the first team at Old Trafford as the brighter sparks came and went. Evolved as football evolved, from teenage tearaway to cultured crosser as the legs slowed. Seven post-2000 Premier League titles, a PFA Player of the Year award and the 2009 Sports Personality of the Year. HLC Getty Images 35/41 67. Antoine Griezmann A very modern forward, adept anywhere across the offensive line and a true team player, always ready to defend from the front. But it is ultimately for his ability in front of goal that he secures his place on this list. A revelation at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and as equally important to the world champions: Griezmann was the top goal scorer as France finished as runners-up at Eurp 2016 before playing a starring role in their triumph two years later in Moscow. LB Getty Images 36/41 66. Clarence Seedorf Seedorf enjoyed great longevity throughout his career divided into two decades. The latter of which, spent in Italy, easily earns his place here after gliding across the pitch for AC Milan, shining bright in Carlo Ancelotti's diamond to collect two Champions League titles - clinching four in total and becoming the only player to win the competition with three different sides. JR AFP/Getty Images 37/41 65. Wesley Sneijder Sneijder won league titles in Spain, Italy, Turkey and his native Netherlands, as well as the Champions League with Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan, and built a stellar international career to become the most capped Dutch player of all time. But the lasting memory is simply of his natural grace on the pitch, gliding over the field before bursting into life to change any game in an instant. LO Getty Images 38/41 64. Gabriel Batistuta A great goalscorer and a scorer of great goals, Batistuta is one of the best strikers ever to have graced Italian football. He remains Fiorentina's top Serie A goalscorer, having spent the majority of his career in Florence before moving to Roma where he finally clinched the title. He is the only footballer ever to have scored a hat-trick at two separate World Cups. LO Getty Images 39/41 63. Fernando Torres A captain of Atletico at 18 El Nino was destined for greatness ever since his formative years. While he may never have hit those heights for long enough his Liverpool career where he tortured the very best, notably Nemanja Vidic at Old Trafford, saw him comfortably become the most feared No 9 on the planet. Add in a world crown and two European titles and you have a player who more than earns his place here. BB Getty Images 40/41 62. Ruud Van Nistelrooy Perhaps the most natural poacher in the countdown, Van Nistelrooy ended his career with better than a goal every two games and churned out far more through his peak years with PSV, Manchester United and Real Madrid. Most notable was his brilliance at the highest level, three times finishing a season as the Champions League's top scorer. Disputes with Dutch managers hindered an international career that might have propelled him higher up this list. LO AFP/Getty Images 41/41 61. Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 Few on this list can say they redefined their position but the little French magician did just that. The Makelele role will go down in the annals for any player with any defensive nous whatsoever, but few since have boasted the football intelligence and positional discipline of the man who coined its name. A player far beyond his era. BB Bongarts/Getty Images 1/41 The Century countdown This week, The Independent is counting down the 100 greatest players of the 21st century.

There have been more fallow years, of course, but at his best Hazard has been magnificent, including in helping Lille to Ligue 1 glory in 2010-11. HLC Getty Images 29/41 73. Cesc Fabregas The fulcrum of Arsene Wenger\u2019s side following Arsenal\u2019s move to the Emirates Stadium, Fabregas combined vision with genuine goalscoring ability to establish himself as one of the world\u2019s most well-rounded and exciting midfielders. Trophies commensurate to the playmaker\u2019s ability to precisely pick out forwards\u2019 runs more often that not did not come in north London, but two Premier League titles with Chelsea after his dream move to Barcelona failed to live up to expectation were just rewards for the midfielder. Nevertheless, he still won La Liga and the Copa del Rey while in Spain, and was part of the squads that won the 2008 and 2012 Euros as well as the 2010 World Cup. KV Getty Images 30/41 72. Deco A player at home in any era who blossomed under Jose Mourinho not once but twice. At home at No 10 Deco effortlessly controlled games for Porto and latterly Chelsea as a key cog in two of the Special One's greatest sides. BB Getty Images 31/41 71. Lilian Thuram Enjoyed the best years of his storied career right at the very start of the 21st century, after he moved from Parma to Juventus in a double transfer, along with Gianluigi Buffon. Went on to form a formidable defensive partnership with Igor Tudor as well as Fabio Cannavaro, before a late career swansong at Barcelona. He also won the European Championship with France in 2000. An imperious defender, who now works tirelessly fighting against racism in football and society. LB AFP/Getty Images 32/41 70. Nemanja Vidic Warrior. Tough as any Premier League centre-half, totemic at times and a pillar of consistency for Manchester United. Indomitable in the air, his partnership with Rio Ferdinand is perhaps the best English football has seen this century, contrasting in styles but with an innate understanding of each others\u2019 abilities. Superb leader to boot. HLC Getty Images 33/41 69. Marcelo The Brazilian is well renowned as one of the best attacking fullbacks in world football, and has been one of Real Madrid\u2019s most consistent performers for a number of years. Arriving at the Santiago Bernabeu as a nervous 19-year-old, Marcelo has lived up to his reputation as Roberto Carlos\u2019 successor at both club and international level, as likely to whip a cross in as he is to audaciously hammer one in from outside the penalty area. Often sporting a smile off the field, Marcelo\u2019s trophy record makes for pleasant reading having experienced four consecutive Champions League victories as well as four La Liga and Club World Cup titles. KV AFP/Getty Images 34/41 68. Ryan Giggs While it can be argued his most captivating moments came before the turn of the millennium, Giggs\u2019 longevity was remarkable, never truly fading from the first team at Old Trafford as the brighter sparks came and went. Evolved as football evolved, from teenage tearaway to cultured crosser as the legs slowed. Seven post-2000 Premier League titles, a PFA Player of the Year award and the 2009 Sports Personality of the Year. HLC Getty Images 35/41 67. Antoine Griezmann A very modern forward, adept anywhere across the offensive line and a true team player, always ready to defend from the front. But it is ultimately for his ability in front of goal that he secures his place on this list. A revelation at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and as equally important to the world champions: Griezmann was the top goal scorer as France finished as runners-up at Eurp 2016 before playing a starring role in their triumph two years later in Moscow. LB Getty Images 36/41 66. Clarence Seedorf Seedorf enjoyed great longevity throughout his career divided into two decades. The latter of which, spent in Italy, easily earns his place here after gliding across the pitch for AC Milan, shining bright in Carlo Ancelotti's diamond to collect two Champions League titles - clinching four in total and becoming the only player to win the competition with three different sides. JR AFP/Getty Images 37/41 65. Wesley Sneijder Sneijder won league titles in Spain, Italy, Turkey and his native Netherlands, as well as the Champions League with Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan, and built a stellar international career to become the most capped Dutch player of all time. But the lasting memory is simply of his natural grace on the pitch, gliding over the field before bursting into life to change any game in an instant. LO Getty Images 38/41 64. Gabriel Batistuta A great goalscorer and a scorer of great goals, Batistuta is one of the best strikers ever to have graced Italian football. He remains Fiorentina's top Serie A goalscorer, having spent the majority of his career in Florence before moving to Roma where he finally clinched the title. He is the only footballer ever to have scored a hat-trick at two separate World Cups. LO Getty Images 39/41 63. Fernando Torres A captain of Atletico at 18 El Nino was destined for greatness ever since his formative years. While he may never have hit those heights for long enough his Liverpool career where he tortured the very best, notably Nemanja Vidic at Old Trafford, saw him comfortably become the most feared No 9 on the planet. Add in a world crown and two European titles and you have a player who more than earns his place here. BB Getty Images 40/41 62. Ruud Van Nistelrooy Perhaps the most natural poacher in the countdown, Van Nistelrooy ended his career with better than a goal every two games and churned out far more through his peak years with PSV, Manchester United and Real Madrid. Most notable was his brilliance at the highest level, three times finishing a season as the Champions League's top scorer. Disputes with Dutch managers hindered an international career that might have propelled him higher up this list. LO AFP/Getty Images 41/41 61. Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 Few on this list can say they redefined their position but the little French magician did just that. The Makelele role will go down in the annals for any player with any defensive nous whatsoever, but few since have boasted the football intelligence and positional discipline of the man who coined its name. A player far beyond his era. BB Bongarts/Getty Images\n\nOnce he had helped Atletico return to the top flight, Torres was named the club\u2019s youngest-ever captain. Aged 19, he has said it was a responsibility he \u201cshould never have taken on so young\u201d. He struggled to command authority over his elders, instead leaning heavily on the experience of team-mate Carlos Aguilera, but this added burden did not stop him from scoring in double figures every season at the Vicente Calderon. He stayed for seven in total, far longer than many fans expected.\n\nThen came Liverpool, where Torres\u2019 career cleaved into two distinct halves. The first is filled with goals like that against Marseille at the Stade Velodrome in late 2007, which incorporated every aspect of his supreme ability as a all-round centre-forward. There is the first touch which leaves Lorik Cana for dead, the shift of weight which flummoxes Julien Rodriguez, the low finish which evades Gael Givet\u2019s attempt at a sliding tackle, then the joyous boyish skip as he watches the ball run into the far corner.\n\nIt is a brilliant individual goal, not dissimilar from his first for Liverpool against Chelsea a few months earlier or one at Derby County a couple of weeks later. From a technical perspective, it is possibly the best of all those he scored during his time at Anfield, but one that the player is not overly fond of. \u201cIndividual goals are often the most striking and skilful,\u201d Torres said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think they\u2019re the most beautiful.\u201d Again, the reluctant superstar was playing down his own brilliance.\n\nIf this first part of Torres\u2019 career is why he is in this list, the second is why he is less than halfway up it. He had already suffered persistent hamstring injuries in the spring of 2010 when he decided to undergo surgery on a knee injury in an attempt to be fit for the World Cup. He rushed back, struggled for form, was dropped by Vicente del Bosque after the quarter-finals and then suffered yet another injury in extra time during the final.\n\nFrom thereon, things were never quite the same. Torres\u2019 struggles to rediscover form and his anxiety to win trophies while still in his prime combined with the disastrous ownership of Tom Hicks and George Gillett to produce a messy Anfield divorce. The takeover by Fenway Sports Group in October 2010 could not salvage the situation and it was reported in January that Torres had effectively handed in a transfer request. His own version of events is different. He wanted assurances from senior figures at Anfield that he was part of the club\u2019s future but received none. He felt unwanted.\n\nIf that seems hard to believe, it at least chimes with a player who did not always fully appreciate his own talents or how much those talents were appreciated. It is also supported by comments from FSG\u2019s former general counsel, Edward Weiss, who would suggest that Liverpool\u2019s new owners considered Torres to be past his best. Weiss was speaking in 2016. His remarks may have been pure hindsight. But if FSG did see a player in decline, they were right to.\n\nThe acrimonious \u00a350m move to Chelsea followed. A modest record of 45 goals in 172 appearances masks a collapse which saw Torres go from that blonde streak of goal-scoring menace and intent to a hollow, forlorn figure, ill-suited to the system and style of play around him, with his head hung low and shoulders buckling under the weight of expectation. It is rare for a player\u2019s misfortunes to be met with anything other than mockery in modern football, and Torres did not escape ridicule by any means, but there was also a genuine sadness about the speed and scale of his decline.\n\nThe bitterness and rancour he inspired on Merseyside after his departure seemed to affect him more than anything else. He still had a great affection for the club, the fans and his time there. In 2014, as if to confirm he was no longer the dead-eyed sharpshooter he once was, he appeared to decide against scoring Chelsea's second goal at Anfield in the famous win which scuppered Liverpool's title challenge. If it was intended as an olive branch, it worked. When he returned for Steven Gerrard's testimonial a year later, the crowd sang his old song again.\n\nIt would be wrong to suggest Torres\u2019 post-2011 career passed without merit or achievement. He won much of his career silverware during those later years. He was named the top scorer at Euro 2012, albeit with only three goals and on a tie-break. He lifted his first trophy with Atletico in his penultimate game for the club. Ask Chelsea supporters, meanwhile, and they will forgive his underwhelming returns for the one goal that mattered most: at the Camp Nou, to book their place in that year\u2019s Champions League final.\n\nWatch the goal back and it is vintage Torres, right from the touch which plucks a long, aimless defensive clearance out from the sky. For a player whose confidence and mentality were persistently questioned, he approaches the 50-yard dash towards Victor Valdes\u2019 goal without a hint of hesitation. Once there, there is the familiar shift in balance, allowing him to round the goalkeeper and finish. It may well be his club career\u2019s finest moment.\n\nHe announced his retirement from football in June, having spent his final season playing with Sagan Tosu in Japan, the home of Captain Tsubasa. The previous summer, he had said goodbye to Atletico and to European football, signing off in typically self-effacing fashion with the words: \u201cThanks for so much and sorry for [giving] so little.\u201d\n\nIt felt like an unnecessarily modest farewell. Not only had Torres just won the Europa League with Atleti, but the money generated from his sale had kick-started a golden era in the club's history. This was a player who had won the World Cup and two European Championships for his country, as well as a Champions League title abroad. He had become a legendary figure at Atletico and was once similarly idolised on Merseyside. He was briefly considered as one of the best in the world, behind only Messi and Ronaldo. But when you remember the player that Torres once was, it is hard not to agree that he could have been so much more.", "description": "Back in 2008, Fernando Torres became the first player to finish third behind both Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo in their era of Ballon d\u2019Or dominance. He had scored 38 times for Liverpool since the start of the previous season and six months earlier, his goal had ended Spain\u2019s 44-year wait to win an international tournament. And yet, he was uncertain whether he belonged", "authors": ["Mark Critchley"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/15/09/fernando-torres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
