Lynch did not respond to The Daily Beast's request for comment, and nor did representatives for Harry and Meghan and the Royal Family.\n\nIn an explosive, recent ITV documentary, later shown on ABC in the United States, Meghan said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard\u2026 I had no idea\u2014which probably sounds difficult to understand here\u2014but when I first met my now-husband, my friends were really happy because I was so happy, but my British friends said to me, \u2018I\u2019m sure he\u2019s great. But you shouldn\u2019t do it because the British tabloids will destroy your life.\u2019 And I very naively\u2014I\u2019m American, we don\u2019t have that there\u2014said, \u2018What are you talking about? That doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u2019 I didn\u2019t get it. So, it\u2019s been complicated.\u201d\n\n\u201c We share an understanding of the abuse and intimidation which is now so often used as a means of disparaging women in public office from getting on with our very important work \u201d\n\n\u201cNot many people have asked if I\u2019m OK, but it\u2019s a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes,\u201d she added.\n\nWhen interviewer Tom Bradby asked Meghan if that meant she wasn\u2019t OK, she replied, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nI thought it would be fair,\u201d Meghan added. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the part that\u2019s really hard to reconcile.\u201d\n\nAlthough they have a different kind of public life, the female MPs state in their letter, \u201cwe share an understanding of the abuse and intimidation which is now so often used as a means of disparaging women in public office from getting on with our very important work.\u201d\n\nThe media, the letter states, should know the difference between a story in the national interest and one which seeks \u201cto tear a woman down for no apparent reason.\u201d\n\nThe women say they will use the means at their disposal to ensure the media respects the Duchess\u2019 right to privacy, and that the stories about her are respectful and true.", "description": "72 British female MPs back Meghan taking a stand against the \u201cdistasteful and misleading nature\u201d of tabloid stories, and condemn the \u201ccolonial undertones\u201d in some coverage.", "authors": ["Tim Teeman", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2250,w_4000,x_0,y_273/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572373910/GettyImages-1172694900_oal5hk", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
