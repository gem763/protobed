The MMR immunization is a very effective measure to protect yourself and to prevent the unintentional spread of this potentially serious infection to others.'", "description": "Los Angeles health officials warned Tuesday that a person with measles visited Disneyland and an area Starbucks on October 16, potentially exposing some 44,000 park-goers to the viral infection.", "authors": ["Natalie Rahhal Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/15/20086522-0-image-a-11_1571840818971.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
