While there are always indications both positive and negative for the economic forecast, there are political motivations for those emphasizing a possible downturn.\n\nKimberly Amadeo, writing in The Balance, reports that, \u201cThe U.S. economic outlook is healthy according to the key economic indicators\u2026There isn\u2019t too much inflation or deflation. That\u2019s a Goldilocks economy.\u201d\n\nUnemployment is at near-record lows. Unemployment for African Americans is at record lows. The growth in jobs in industries such as manufacturing have been astounding.\n\nAs noted in Forbes, In the final 26 months of Obama\u2019s presidency, manufacturing employment increased barely 0.8%. In President Trump\u2019s first 26 months, it grew 3.9% -- that's 399% more jobs than Obama\u2019s record.\n\nIn another area, mining, even labor leaders have praised Trump for his success. In an interview with The Hill Cecil Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers of America, it was noted that \u201cAccording to a 2018 report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, an estimated 2,000 new coal jobs were created during Trump\u2019s first year in office\u201d and the once nose-diving labor picture there has finally stabilized.\u201d\n\nWage growth across the board continues to be a positive note.\n\nThe economy is considered to be in the best condition in the past 19 years, with the highest confidence rating in the past 14.\n\nThe significant threat to the economy from China\u2019s rapacious policies of restricted access to its markets, intellectual property theft, dumping and other practices long ignored by Washington, is finally being addressed by the White House. While this could result in some substantive temporary issues, the long-term result will be a significant boost for the U.S. economy.\n\nStephen Moore stated in a Heritage Foundation/Washington Times study that \u201cBeijing\u2019s abusive trade practices and theft of U.S. intellectual property ($300 billion stolen per year), are intolerable...\"\n\nHis analysis explains that,\n\n\u201cThe United States is simply a better place to invest in today than it was two years ago. If/when Mr. Trump prevails and gets the concessions from China, the market upside is gigantic and that\u2019s what isn\u2019t being discounted into the market today. There\u2019s an old saying that Wall Street economists have predicted eight of the last two recessions. The bears in the economics profession keep getting paid a lot of money misreading the nation\u2019s economic weather. [\u2026] The boom began on Nov. 8, 2016, not in 2009. The recovery was anemic in the Obama years.\u201d\n\nA biased media continues to overemphasize negative indicators. It\u2019s more than just poor journalism. The type of fear generated by that incorrect reporting can lead to a lack of confidence that actually could spur a recession. In an analysis for the Federal Reserve, David S. Miller warns, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict recessions. We haven\u2019t had many, and we don\u2019t fully understand the causes of the ones we\u2019ve had. Nevertheless, we persist in trying.\u201d\n\nAs Joseph Valle reported in Newsbusters that the leftist media hyped recession fears every single day in June and July.\n\n\u201c\u2026 At least one journalist openly sided with left-wing comedian Bill Maher who wants a recession to get rid of President Donald Trump. NBC\u2019s Richard Engel chimed in \u201cShort-term pain might be better\u2026 after Maher said \u2018I really do\u2019 want a recession on HBO\u2019s Real Time with Bill Maher Aug. 9. \"A recession is generally considered two quarters or more of negative economic growth. That hasn\u2019t stopped the media from pushing \u201cdark clouds\u201d and the likelihood of a recession coming soon, possibly even before the 2020 election. That could have serious consequences if economist Mohamed El-Erian was correct when he warned \u201cwe\u2019ve got to be careful because we can talk ourselves into a recession.\u201d\n\nGregory Daco, writing in The Hill warns that, \u201cWe must not turn recession fears into self-fulfilling prophecies.\u201d\n\nFrank Vernuccio serves as editor-in-chief of the New York Analysis of Policy and Government.", "description": "There is an intense drive on the part of the .09/02/2019 3:13:00AM EST.", "authors": ["Frank Vernuccio", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/302/05fcdb00-2dfe-41ba-8059-1cce0d0b74f9.jpg"}
