'Cuz that's absurd\" and \"This is a nudge to pick up the fudge.\"\n\nThe campaign started this week and the department noted on Facebook that leaving behind a pet's mess in many cases violates a city ordinance.\n\nThe flags are made of bamboo and recycled paper.\n\nThe city said it picks up nearly 25 pounds (11.34 kilograms) of poop a week from downtown parks and parking lots, costing $7,500 annually.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
