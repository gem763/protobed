Ed Royce, lost a race for the state\u2019s 16th District to Democratic Rep. Jim Costa by 15 points last fall. She recently founded the group to help diversify the Republican Party.\n\n\u201cThis is the face of socialism. And, ignorance,\u201d Heng says in the ad over an image of Ocasio-Cortez, which then starts burning to reveal images from the Cambodian genocide.\n\n\u201cDoes Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez know the horror of socialism? My father was minutes from death in Cambodia, before a forced marriage saved his life,\u201d Heng says in the ad. \u201cThat\u2019s socialism. Forced obedience, starvation. Mine is a face of freedom.
