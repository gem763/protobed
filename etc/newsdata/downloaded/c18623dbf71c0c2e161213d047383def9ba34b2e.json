We want to make them feel at home,\u201d said Cornelius Bor ahead of the race which finished in the early hours of Sunday.\n\nBor\u2019s friend Elliot Kirwa, a runner turned security officer, said \u201cwe are supposed to sleep, we are supposed to go to work \u2014 but we had to come and cheer them\u201d.\n\n\u201cMy duty is 4:00 a.m. but I will first finish watching them, then I will go there \u2014 and I\u2019m so happy, so proud of them,\u201d added Bor who then chanted \u201cone, two, three Kenya!\u201d.\n\n\u201c(On Sunday) we have 10,000m, Julius Yego in the javelin. He will clear Khalifa stadium!\u201d\n\nNearby another group of men chanted and danced in unison, draping the Kenyan colours over an advertising hoarding.\n\nKenya\u2019s Amos Kipruto, who won bronze, told AFP his countrymen \u201cgave me morale\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis medal I dedicate to all my fans in Doha,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I win, Kenyans win.\u201d\n\nMany other migrant workers turned out in force to support runners from their native countries at the event which saw Ethiopia\u2019s Lelisa Desisa win gold in two hours 10 minutes 40 seconds.\n\n\u2013 \u2018We feel at home\u2019 \u2013\n\nKenyans make up roughly 30,000 of Qatar\u2019s 2.6 million population and are often employed as security guards while Ethiopians number around 25,000 according to official statistics.\n\nKenyans were among a number of nations whose embassies in Doha handed out free tickets to their citizens following dismal crowds in the championships\u2019 opening days.\n\n\u201cWe feel at home,\u201d said Bor, a security officer.\n\nEven more African supporters would have been able to attend if not for the tournament\u2019s late start times, often after 10:00 p.m. (1900 GMT) for finals, according to some diaspora members.\n\n\u201cThey put it at night and guys are working. At night time I don\u2019t think they made it. A few people (did), but not too much,\u201d said Wilson Mwenji, a former runner from Nairobi resident in Doha for four years, as he prepared to watch the women\u2019s marathon on September 27.\n\nBut Mercy, another Kenyan living in Qatar, said the championships had been \u201cvery well organised\u201d as she walked past the main track venue, Doha\u2019s Khalifa stadium.\n\n\u201cI love the fact that it is in the city and security is very amazing too. Kenya have been doing great, we got a gold medal for the men\u2019s 3,000m steeplechase,\u201d she told AFP. \u201cIt\u2019s been great.\u201d\n\nInternational Association of Athletics Federations president Sebastian Coe has said he wants to ensure athletics are \u201cnot just rooted in a handful of European capitals\u201d \u2014 but the flagship event has never been staged in Africa.\n\nAthletics and road races in particular are hugely popular on the continent and have fewer barriers to entry compared to other sports.", "description": "Doha (AFP) \u2013 Dozens of African running fans lined Doha\u2019s seafront to glimpse their countrymen vie for gold in the World Athletics", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/05/53da1e_migrant-workers-turned-out-in-force-support-runners-native-countries-world-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
