They haven't included Abuja, but Lagos is at the bottom of this list.\n\nThere are certainly more crimes committed in Lagos than Abuja - three times as many per head of population, according to Nigerian official data for 2017.\n\nBut Lagos is a much bigger city, and remember - the official recorded murder rate per capita was higher for Abuja.\n\nSo Abuja is clearly not as safe as Tokyo, Singapore, Osaka and Amsterdam - which are considered the safest cities in the world.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nAbuja is a planned city and is relatively affluent. It was built from scratch in the 1980s and became the nation's capital in 1991.\n\nIt's the centre of government and home to foreign embassies, diplomats and businesses.\n\nHowever, instability in the rest of the country and Abuja's relative wealth have meant that crime and violence is often spilling over into the capital.\n\nThe BBC's Hausa language service says residents are concerned about the rise in kidnappings - and were disappointed with the police chief's statements.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Nigeria has seen much insecurity in the north-east. Oby Ezekwesili is the leader of the Bring Back Our Girls movement that campaigns against Boko Haram\n\n\"The city, once considered an island of safety amidst the surge of incidents elsewhere, now appears increasingly vulnerable,\" says Nnamdi Obasi of the International Crisis Group.\n\n\"The influx of people displaced by rural poverty, armed conflicts and violent crime in many parts of the country is continually swelling the population of the city's unemployed youth, with many susceptible to criminal life,\" he adds.\n\nWhat claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?
