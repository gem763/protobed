Forbes' Samantha Sharf also reported that Neumann's cofounder, Miguel McKelvey, has also lost his billionaire status.\n\nThe $3.5 billion drop in Neumann's personal net worth was the result of the declining value of Neumann's 18% stake in WeWork, Forbes reported. WeWork was valued at $47 billion in January following an investment from Japanese investment firm Softbank. However, the company reportedly sought a valuation as low as $10 billion in September as public scrutiny over its steep losses and leadership structure threatened its IPO. Forbes now estimates that the company is worth \"at most $2.8 billion.\"\n\nA representative for Neumann declined Business Insider's request for comment on whether Neumann's net worth had fallen below $1 billion.\n\nThe Forbes calculation of Neumann's net worth includes:\n\n$504 million stake in WeWork, and\n\n$500 million he profited from stock sales,\n\nminus $380 million in debt disclosed in WeWork's S1 filing.\n\nRead more: The WeWork IPO fiasco of 2019, explained in 30 seconds\n\nForbes does not believe that either Neumann or McKelvey \u2014 who the publication says is now worth $400 million \u2014 will likely rejoin the three comma club.\n\nNeumann founded WeWork in 2010 alongside his now-wife Rebekah Neumann and Miguel McKelvey. Concern from potential investors over the company's finances and corporate governance issues pushed Neumann to resign as WeWork's CEO on September 24.\n\nUnder Neumann's leadership, the company was plagued by a party culture that included alcohol-fueled company retreats and little work-life balance, Business Insider's Meghan Morris and Julie Bort previously reported.\n\nHave you worked for Adam Neumann or WeWork and have a story you'd like to share?
