There was applause at the end of the hearing.\n\nMr Chada requested that Brown\u2019s walking cane was returned to him after it was confiscated by officers. The request was granted by Mr Zani.\n\nBrown is next due to appear at Southwark Crown Court in London on November 8 for trial.\n\nThe athlete\u2019s arrest and charging capped a week of demonstrations against climate inaction which saw more than 1,100 arrests across the capital.\n\nJames Brown being detained by police (Caitlin Doherty/PA)\n\nBrown competed for Britain, Ireland and Northern Ireland in a career which saw him participate at five Paralympic Games and earn two gold medals and a bronze.\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside of court after the hearing, Brown said he was \u201crelieved\u201d to be out of custody, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s good to be out in the fresh air, even though it\u2019s raining.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cI am not denying what I did, but I was compelled to do what I did because of my concerns for the future of my children.\n\n\u201cWe also know that non-violent civil disobedience has proven itself time and time in history to bring about radical social change, and that is exactly what we need right now to divert us from this catastrophic path we are on.\u201d", "description": "The alleged offence took place at London City Airport on Thursday.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/15/wire-19628494-1570891426-418_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
