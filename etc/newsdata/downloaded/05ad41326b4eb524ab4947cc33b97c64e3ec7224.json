including rebel Tories - voted in favour of a bill requiring him to seek an extension to the Brexit deadline of 31 October if a deal is not reached before 19 October.\n\nThat bill is set to gain royal assent and become law on Monday, but has been criticised by ministers as \"lousy\" and weakening the government's negotiating position with Brussels.\n\nDowning Street said Monday's vote, which comes ahead of this week's shutdown of Parliament, was Labour's last chance to secure an early election and have the chance to win its own mandate from the public to delay Brexit.\n\nThe motion, which requires the support of two-thirds of MPs, was defeated last week and is expected to fail again.\n\n'Test to the limit'\n\nAs Mr Johnson continues to press for an election, ministers have said they will \"test to the limit\" the new law aimed at averting no-deal.\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab said the government would abide by the law but will \"look very carefully\" at its \"interpretation\" of the legislation.\n\nOne plan under discussion is to formally request the extension while sending a second document making it clear the UK government does not want one.\n\nAnother potential option is to ask a sympathetic EU member to veto an extension.\n\nFrance's foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said his country would not be able to support another Brexit delay \"in the current circumstances\".\n\nMeanwhile, Plaid Cymru has said opposition party leaders should try and impeach Mr Johnson if he ignores the no-deal law.\n\n'Serious about a deal'\n\nIt comes after Amber Rudd resigned as work and pensions secretary at the weekend, saying the government was spending 80-90% of its time on no-deal planning rather than trying to reach an agreement with the EU.\n\nShe told the BBC there was \"very little evidence\" the government would get a new Brexit deal, and when she asked for details of the efforts she received a \"one-page summary\".\n\nFormer minister Rory Stewart, who resigned from the cabinet when Mr Johnson became prime minister in July, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there may be other unhappy cabinet ministers.\n\n\"Remember very, very recently, barely seven weeks ago, the formal policy of the cabinet was to avoid a no-deal Brexit,\" he said.\n\nAsked about the idea of a new party made up of independent Conservatives, Mr Stewart said the current parties needed to be \"genuinely broad\".\n\n\"Unfortunately the reality is that even were we to form an independent party, it could get as much as 15% of the vote of the population and not get any seats in Parliament,\" he said.\n\n\"I believe what we should be doing is making the positive case to return the Conservative Party to the centre ground.\"\n\nWriting in the Daily Mail, Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan said \"watching talented colleagues walking away from the cabinet table is never easy\", but she backed Mr Johnson.\n\nShe said the public was \"exhausted and fed up\" with \"endless delays\" and said that the no-deal option had to be kept on the table.\n\nMs Morgan said \"the prime minister now needs to show he's serious about getting a deal\" and the government needed to display more transparency about its efforts.\n\nAn alternative to the Irish backstop, the insurance policy that prevents a hard border on the island of Ireland, is key to striking a deal, Ms Morgan added.\n\nImage copyright PA Media Image caption \"I don't anticipate a big breakthrough,\" Irish PM Leo Varadkar said ahead of Mr Johnson's visit\n\nThe UK government wants the backstop scrapped, because it would effectively keep the UK in the European customs regime and tie Northern Ireland to the rules of the single market.\n\nBut Ireland maintains the backstop, which comes into force if the UK does not agree a free trade deal with the EU, is the only way to avoid checkpoints.\n\nMr Johnson's meeting in Dublin will be his first with the Irish taoiseach since he became prime minister.\n\nAhead of the visit Mr Varadkar played down expectations of an imminent solution to the border issue.\n\n\"I don't think the meeting tomorrow is a high stakes meeting, as I don't anticipate a big breakthrough tomorrow,\" he said.\n\nIf an agreement is struck, it is more likely to happen in October at the EU summit, Mr Varadkar said.\n\nThe Irish prime minister has said he is open to a solution involving a backstop which only applies to Northern Ireland.\n\nBut the Democratic Unionist Party - Mr Johnson's allies in Parliament - strongly opposes the idea.\n\nThe week ahead\n\nMonday\n\nMPs vote again on whether to trigger an early election - the vote is expected to fail\n\nThe cross-party bill designed to prevent a no-deal Brexit on 31 October is set to gain royal assent\n\nParliament could be prorogued (suspended) until 14 October from Monday but this could happen as late as Thursday\n\nMr Johnson meets Irish Taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar\n\nMPs will also debate a petition, which has been signed by 1.7 million people, aiming to stop the prorogation of Parliament\n\nWednesday:\n\nMr Johnson is due to appear in front of the Commons' Liaison Committee, made up of the chairs of all select committees, facing questions on Brexit, social policy and climate change\n\nA ruling is expected from Scotland's highest civil court on whether the proroguing of Parliament is illegal, in response to an appeal by a group of MPs and peers\n\nThursday:", "description": "No 10 is calling on Labour to go to the polls, but opposition MPs want to rule out no-deal Brexit first.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B50A/production/_108664364_hi056254944.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
