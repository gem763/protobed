Jim Himes (D-CT), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said \u201call transcripts\u201d from the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry will be made public.\n\nJon Karl asked, \u201cCongressman, why is this all happening behind closed doors? Why the secrecy? This is not a classified deposition. Why not do it out in the open?\u201d\n\nHimes said, \u201cFirst of all, all transcripts will be scrubbed for classified information and made available for the American public to see. There\u2019s two reasons why these depositions are happening behind closed doors. One reason is when you\u2019re talking to ambassadors and other U.S. government officials who have regularly had access to classified information, you need to be able to talk about that and then say this has to be redacted because it involved classified information. That\u2019s the most important reason. The second reason is, when you\u2019re interviewing people around the president, political supporters of the president, you don\u2019t want them to be able to look at each other\u2019s testimony and coordinate testimony. These are a group of people who have shown they have no problem whatsoever lying if they think it serves their interests. You don\u2019t want to give them the opportunity to look at what they\u2019re saying and coordinate their stories.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Sunday's broadcast of\u00a0 ABC's \"This Week,\" Rep.
