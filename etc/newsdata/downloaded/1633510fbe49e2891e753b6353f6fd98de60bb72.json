She Certainly Deserved Better", "language": "en", "text": "The name PT Usha is sure to ring a bell for us. Of course, why not, she pretty much put us on the map in athletics once again after Milkha Singh had quit. But now take the name of Ashwini Nachappa, most people shall draw a blank.\n\nThis is the lady who outran Usha not once but twice and yet very few of us actually know who she is.

Ashwini followed it up with 2 silvers and 3 gold medals in the 1986 and 1988 editions respectively. Another highlight was the 1990 silver medal at the Asian Games.\n\nBut sadly, due to lack of support and infrastructure and seeing no positive future in the sport, Ashwini quit athletics and turned to acting. She acted in her own biopic but her movie career did not last long in regional cinema.\n\nShe is currently the president of the Bangalore Urban District Athletics Association, but living a life away from the public eye. She is just another name in the list of forgotten Indian athletes who are hardly known to us. Ashwini certainly deserved better.
