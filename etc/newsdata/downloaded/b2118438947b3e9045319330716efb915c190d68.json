I come from this beautiful country, and it\u2019s a great place to have grown up, so I want everyone to have a little taste of our island. I promise you the best meal you can have in this country.\u201d\n\nFor Frederick, proprietor of our pink-hued seafront lunch spot overlooking Delaport Bay on the northern shore of New Providence, local flavour and authenticity is a genuine concern. And, as it turned out, it\u2019s a familiar refrain.\n\nEverywhere we went in the Bahamas, people were almost painfully keen for us to appreciate \u201cthis beautiful little country\u201d. We did appreciate it, of course.", "description": "", "authors": ["Susan Veness", "Simon Veness"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2019/October/getty-bahamas-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
