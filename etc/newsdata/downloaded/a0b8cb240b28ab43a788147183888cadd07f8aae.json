YouTuber Michelle Khare underwent a grueling physical and emotional journey as she took on Police Academy training for her 'Challenge Accepted' series\n\nTough: The 27-year-old was pushed to her limits during the training and she was even pepper sprayed, left, at one point which caused her eyes to burn, right\n\nPainful: Michelle said the worst part of the whole experience was the aftermath of the pepper spray, pictured\n\nShe's a natural: Michelle, pictured, was praised by officers for her 'survivor' mentality throughout the training\n\nThe opening line of the video sums up Michelle's experience.\n\n'Police Academy is a mental game. If you allow the nerves and the mental game to run away from you, that's when people crash and burn,' she tells viewers, reciting a quote uttered by SDPD vet Sandy Albrektsen, who has been at the department for 37 years.\n\nMichelle said that the video was one she has been 'wanting to do for a long time' as she feels not everyone in America feels comfortable calling the police these days.\n\nDuring her time at SDPD, she was given a 'small taste' of what it's like to be a law enforcement officer as she was pushed to her limits.\n\nReal:There was nothing staged about the video, and Michelle was genuinely tased, above, in one scenario which saw 1,200-2,500 volts of electricity coursing through her body\n\nPlain sailing: Compared to the rest of her tasks, joining the Harbor Unit, pictured, was practically a walk in the park\n\nThe 33-minute video started with a veritable walk in the park: experiencing what the Harbor Unit and Beach Patrol get up to an average day in Southern California.\n\nMichelle said it was 'pretty neat to see the police in action and see that side of things' as they responded to three calls in five minutes.\n\nHowever, from the get go she could see how difficult it was for the police to get people to not assume the worst of them - even when they asked people 'politely' to refrain from doing something unlawful.\n\nNext up, a grueling obstacle course proved pretty tough, although Michelle beat the time requirement by 10 seconds.\n\nSpeedy: Michelle beat the time for the obstacle course, pictured, with 10 seconds to spare\n\nUnstoppable: During the obstacle course, Michelle sprinted, left, and dragged a human-size dummy, right, along the sand\n\nThe YouTuber could be heard panting as she got to the end of the challenge after sprinting up stairs and ladders, running around cones, climbing six-foot walls and dragging a dummy.\n\nThe supervising officer, Sergeant Jonathan Lowe, reminded her that members of the police force have to be physically strong and agile as they could be required to chase down a suspect or carry an injured colleague.\n\nSergeant Lowe also pointed out that police officers tend to be 30 lbs heavier when they're in full uniform, so they have to keep their fitness up to scratch.\n\nOn the shooting range, Michelle got to put her accuracy skills to the test.\n\nThe officers informed her that unlike in movies and TV - where shootouts can last whole scenes - in real life you often have only seconds to make your shot.\n\nAim: Michelle learned how to shoot moving targets with only seconds to think\n\nUncomfortable: Viewers could see she didn't enjoy handling the firearm though she handled the task with grace\n\nShe passed with flying colors: After the pursuit driving lesson, Michelle was told she did better than the average trainee police officer\n\nMichelle was instructed to aim for 'upper A zones' on moving targets. She is heard letting out a scream as she pulls the trigger, evidently uncomfortable using the weapon.\n\nAs part of the video, Michelle sat down with Lieutenant Shawn Takeuchi for a moving discussion on police brutality.\n\n'How can we trust the people who are protecting us,' she asks.\n\nLieutenant Takeuchi responds that an 'open dialogue with the community is very, very important'.\n\nHe notes how engaging with members of San Diego's diverse community through monthly meetings allows the police to continually work on establishing trust.\n\nAs part of the experience, Michelle got to try her hand at pursuit driving, aka 'chasing bad guys'.\n\nWhile it proved difficult, she was told that she did 'better than the average recruit' behind the wheel.\n\n'We need to get her a real badge,' retired officer Greg Mrvich joked.\n\n'I'm going to refrain from that responsibility,' she responded incredulously.\n\nDuring the Arrest and Control lesson, Michelle is shown how to quickly press a nerve on someone's neck if they resist arrest.\n\nOuch! Officers demonstrated the nerve on which to apply pressure during an arrest if someone is resisting\n\nPain: If a person resists, officers inform them that they will start applying pain on the nerve\n\nShe even experiences it herself as the officers perform the move on her.\n\nEmotions: Viewers could see Michelle going through the full spectrum of emotions\n\nWhen it comes to using the pepper spray and tasing someone, Michelle finds it hard to be forceful. When she is forced to beat a dummy with a baton, she's almost at tipping point.\n\n'It feels really weird to use force against someone, especially holding the baton... it's really bizarre for me, because I've only seen the negative videos on social media of police officers using force,' she said.\n\n'I didn't even want myself to be filmed holding a baton yelling. I have to remember that all of these are last resort tactics,' she added.\n\nMichelle is visibly traumatized after experiencing the taser, as she is informed that between 1,200 to 2,500 volts will course through her body locking up her muscles. '\n\n'Last resort tactics': The Louisiana-native said she found it difficult even beating the dummy and didn't want that part to be filmed\n\nWarning: The YouTuber learns how to warn someone before spraying them with pepper spray\n\nAll bases covered: Michelle is shown how to tase, left, and also experiences what it feels like, right\n\nOther scenarios include learning what to do in conflict situations. At one stage, she's quite literally being attacked by multiple people as she is forced to fight to escape.\n\n'We did not rehearse that. It feels very real,' a shook Michelle said as she gets her head around the stimulated shoot outs.\n\n'Even just doing this active shooter drill is terrifying and I knew I wasn't going to die,' she added.\n\nHowever, she was routinely praised for having a natural 'survival mentality'.\n\nDuring the video, police officers give their own opinions as to how it feels to see people in their profession make the wrong decisions.\n\nPoignantly, footage of Black Lives Matter marches in the wake of the shooting of Trayvon Martin were shown.\n\nTesting: The video of Michelle's grueling experience has been viewed 3.4 million times\n\nGiving it her all: As Michelle was set upon by a group of people, she showed she had natural fighter instincts as she kicked them off\n\n'Terrified': The content creator was shown what it's like to pursue someone who is shooting at police officers\n\n'It comes down to mutual respect and understanding that there's differences. We need to grow together in harmony. It hurts, personally, when I see that clash,' one officer said.\n\n'Social media is only populated with one story. We care, we genuinely care about the community,' the officer added.\n\nMichelle admitted that she taught the experience wouldn't be as tough.\n\n'I had a misconception that this would be a little bit easier than the military training that I've done before but it was very, very hard,' she said.\n\nIn a particularly challenging instance, she is seen crying and spluttering as she is pepper sprayed but forced to still fight and perform an arrest.\n\nThe experience allowed her to get an insight into what life is like for the officers and how they genuinely risk their lives regularly - she even heard one officer recall when he was shot in the face and chest by a crazed gunman in an apartment complex.\n\nStings: Michelle said the worst part was being pepper sprayed, which felt like a cross between her skin being on fire and a bee sting, pictured,\n\nArrest: She persevered to handcuff someone despite not being able to see after getting pepper sprayed\n\n'Many, many men and women in uniform are doing the right thing, it's important to honor them,' Michelle said.\n\nTo end the experience, she joined the officers for the San Diego Pride parade, as some talk about being part of the LGBTQ community themselves.\n\nReal life Barbie: Michelle was praised by commentors who said, like Barbie, she 'can do anything'\n\nThe video made it to YouTube's trending list where it was applauded by Michelle's 1.5 million subscribers.\n\n'I feel like Michelle is my real life Barbie. She's beautiful, independent, kind, and caring. But most of all she doesn't limit herself, she can be and do anything. And I think that's very admirable,' praised one commentor.\n\n'She should have her own Netflix series,' said another.\n\nAnother wrote, 'I think that these 'Challenge Accepted' videos are incredible. Michelle is putting herself in situations that likely few people, if any, would want to be in.\n\n'Especially in this video, how many people will willingly be pepper sprayed or tased. I'm awestruck at her courage to do these things for education,' they concluded.", "description": "Michelle Khare turned her attention to Police Academy for the latest installment of her Challenge Accepted series, showing viewers what it's like learning the ropes of law enforcement.", "authors": ["Freya Drohan For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/14/19317214-0-image-a-159_1570455487951.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
