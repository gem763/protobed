This show of strength at SpaceX headquarters comes just two weeks after the two figures exchanged public jabs in the press, suggesting friction between SpaceX and NASA.\n\n\u201cElon and I are in strong agreement on this \u2014 that the one thing we have under development that is of the highest priority is launching American astronauts on American rockets from American soil,\u201d Bridenstine said during his visit to SpaceX. \u201cHuman spaceflight is the reason that SpaceX was created, and we\u2019re incredibly honored to partner with NASA,\u201d Musk said. \u201cAnd just to make this happen, this is a dream come true, really.\u201d\n\n\u201cthis is a dream come true, really.\u201d\n\nSpaceX is one of two companies developing hardware to transport NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station, as part of the space agency\u2019s Commercial Crew program. Since the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2011, NASA has had to rely on Russia\u2019s Soyuz rocket to transport crew members to the ISS \u2014 an option that costs roughly $85 million per seat. But with the Commercial Crew program, the goal is for SpaceX and rival Boeing to ferry astronauts on American-made capsules for much lower costs \u2014 around $50 million per seat, according to NASA\u2019s estimates.\n\nHowever, the Commercial Crew program has been plagued by delays. NASA expected the first crews to fly in 2017, but the target dates have been repeatedly pushed back. In March of this year, SpaceX flew an uncrewed version of its capsule, called Crew Dragon, which successfully docked with the ISS and then returned to Earth. But a month later, that same capsule exploded during a ground test in Cape Canaveral, Florida, leading to further delays and questions about the future of SpaceX\u2019s timeline. No human has flown on a Commercial Crew vehicle yet.\n\nNow, both Bridenstine and Musk say that SpaceX is almost ready to fly, depending on how testing goes through the end of the year. \u201cWhen it comes to these new development capabilities, I will say that we are getting very close,\u201d Bridenstine said today. \u201cAnd we\u2019re very confident that in the first part of next year, we will be ready to launch American astronauts on American rockets.\u201d\n\n\u201cRegardless of whether we make it in the first part of next year is less relevant than the fact that we will make it.\u201d\n\nBridenstine noted that timeline could easily change, though. \u201cIf something comes up that we didn\u2019t know, then it could be longer than that,\u201d he said. \u201cRegardless of whether we make it in the first part of next year is less relevant than the fact that we will make it.\u201d\n\nThe optimistic tone contrasts with the tense exchange that occurred between Bridenstine and Musk in the run-up to the CEO\u2019s latest keynote event. On Saturday, September 28th, Musk gave a big presentation in Boca Chica, Texas, where he detailed the progress on his company\u2019s future Starship rocket, a giant vehicle that\u2019s supposed to take humans into deep space.\n\nThe Friday before the event, Bridenstine tweeted his thoughts on the update. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to the SpaceX event tomorrow,\u201d he wrote in a statement. \u201cIn the meantime, Commercial Crew is years behind schedule. NASA expects the same level of enthusiasm focused on the investments of the American taxpayer. It\u2019s time to deliver.\u201d At the time, the statement read as criticism of the event, suggesting that the celebration surrounding the new rocket was inappropriate when SpaceX still had yet to fulfill its obligations to NASA and get the company\u2019s other vehicles flying.\n\nAfter his update, Musk shot back at Bridenstine during an interview with CNN. When asked about the administrator\u2019s tweet, Musk cheekily replied, \u201cDid he say Commercial Crew or SLS?\u201d referring to NASA\u2019s long-delayed rocket that\u2019s also supposed to take people into deep space. Musk also claimed that SpaceX would likely be flying its first passengers for the Commercial Crew program in \u201cthree or four months.\u201d\n\nBridenstine swiftly shot down that estimate. In follow up interviews with both CNN and The Atlantic, Bridenstine said he did not think three to four months was a reasonable estimate, since SpaceX has been struggling with a few key areas of development. He also said that Musk\u2019s criticism of the SLS \u201cwasn\u2019t helpful.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s meeting was a public display of friendliness between Bridenstine and Musk, with Musk making it clear that Crew Dragon is a priority. Even Bridenstine noted that NASA wants Starship to succeed. \u201cWe have been a partner on Starship, a non-exchange-of-funds kind of partner, when it comes to aerodynamics, and when it comes to testing and test facilities,\u201d said Bridenstine.\n\nSpaceX faces two big issues\n\nThe focus was Commercial Crew. Bridenstine and Musk say that SpaceX faces two big issues. SpaceX ultimately linked the April explosion to a problem with the small engines, called abort thrusters, that are used to carry the Crew Dragon\u2019s crew to safety during an emergency. As a result, the company has had to redesign the abort system. The second problem is parachute testing \u2014 something that SpaceX\u2019s rival Boeing has been battling with as well.\n\n\u201cThose are the only two items that I\u2019m aware of, that SpaceX is aware of, that put the schedule at risk,\u201d Musk said today. \u201cBut there may be other things that we discover, this is also important to bear in mind. You do not know what you do not know.\u201d\n\nTo meet higher standards, SpaceX has upgraded its parachutes by switching materials and changing the stitching pattern used. Musk claims the new parachutes are twice as safe as NASA\u2019s Apollo parachutes, which were used to return humans from the Moon. \u201cMy opinion is that these are the best parachutes ever, like, by a lot,\u201d said Musk. The CEO said that SpaceX plans to do at least 10 more parachute drop tests by the end of the year.\n\nAs for the abort system, testing is still needed to verify that the new design is sound. But even SpaceX\u2019s first two crew members \u2014 NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley \u2014 aren\u2019t concerned about riding on the vehicle, despite a few initial questions from friends and family. \u201cThese things happen, and while it\u2019s disappointing, it also can be a real gift to the final design,\u201d said Hurley, \u201cbecause you can inform the final design.\u201d Musk also argued that a lack of problems during testing is indicative of a poor test program. \u201cTo be totally frank, if there hasn\u2019t been some hardware that blows up on the test stand, I don\u2019t think you tested it hard enough,\u201d he said.\n\nMusk claimed today that if all testing proceeds normally, the Crew Dragon that will fly Behnken and Hurley could be at its launch site in Cape Canaveral by December. But Bridenstine and Musk reassured everyone that NASA won\u2019t fly astronauts on the vehicle until they are certain the crew will be safe. Still, there is some pressure to fly sooner rather than later. NASA only has a limited number of seats for its astronauts on upcoming Soyuz flights to the station, and those seats run out by the fall of 2020.\n\nNo matter what happens, Musk promised transparency as SpaceX moves forward, something that the company has been criticized for not providing over the last few years. \u201cWe\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re kept up to speed on... everything we\u2019ve learned, good or bad,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you\u2019ll know the straight scoop.\u201d", "description": "The two are reassuring everyone they\u2019ve made up", "authors": ["Loren Grush", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aHibVu9ZqXUJP7qTXvQgLQOVMCI=/0x123:1919x1128/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19277200/KSC_20190302_PH_KLS02_0054_large.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
