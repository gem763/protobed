She is also her party's candidate for president in an election to be held on November 10.\n\nPresident Klaus Iohannis will now have to choose a replacement prime minister. He said he will meet with political parties Friday morning and once a nomination has been made, he or she has 10 days to form a government.\n\nThe development also raises questions about who will be Romania's nominee for the European Commission. D\u0103ncil\u0103 had put forward two names \u2014 Rovana Plumb and Dan Nica. President-elect Ursula von der Leyen picked Plumb but she was rejected by the European Parliament. D\u0103ncil\u0103 renominated Nica this week but he was not officially accepted.\n\n\"We need to make a nomination for European commissioner that respects the standards of professionalism and credibility,\" Iohannis said.\n\nD\u0103ncil\u0103 accused the opposition of having no alternative plan for running the country.\n\nDan Barna, leader of opposition group Save Romania Union, said the fall of the government should serve as \"a lesson ... that these people should never receive another chance.\"\n\nThe confidence vote took place after a week of negotiations during which two Social Democratic Party (PSD) members quit and joined the opposition, only to change their minds and move back. Most PSD lawmakers did not cast a vote on Thursday.\n\nThe vote was preceded by a tense debate during which the PSD and the opposition accused each other of being unable to govern.\n\nD\u0103ncil\u0103's grip on power had been shaky for months, especially after her former coalition partner ALDE decided in August to walk away from government, leaving some ministerial posts unfilled.\n\nSpeaking during the debate preceding the vote, Raluca Turcan from the National Liberal Party, the largest opposition group, accused D\u0103ncil\u0103 of \"abusively occupying\" the role of prime minister.\n\n\"I strongly believe this is the last time we are addressing an illegitimate prime minister that stepped all over the country's right to move towards the European path and not turn back to the '90s,\" she said.\n\nFormer PSD Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who created his own party called Pro Romania, criticized the government for being the only one in the EU that still does not have an official candidate for the \"next Commission of Ursula.\" Ponta said he didn't use von der Leyen's last name to avoid confusing D\u0103ncil\u0103 (who has been criticized for making grammatical errors).\n\nD\u0103ncil\u0103 accused the opposition of having no alternative plan for running the country.\n\n\"You are not fighting to do good for people. You are fighting against the PSD, against the country's interest,\" she said. \"You don't have political maturity, you don't know how to govern for Romanians.\"\n\nThe Romanian government survived a vote of confidence at the end of December.\n\nROMANIA NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.", "description": "The move complicates the country\u2019s need to find a European commissioner.", "authors": ["Anca Gurzu"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/h_55537110-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
