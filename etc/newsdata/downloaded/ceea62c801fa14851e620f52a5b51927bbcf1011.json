Its readership has fallen to 0.01 per cent of the population over 14, while People\u2019s has dropped to 0.02 per cent.\n\nA Bauer Media spokeswoman told Guardian Australia discussions to close the magazines had been taking place \u201cas the magazines have lost ranging (visibility), which has affected their commercial viability\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs closures impact a number of people, including some staff and suppliers, they need to be well considered and timed appropriately,\u201d the spokeswoman said.\n\n\u201cThe magazines will be closing at the end of the year and we\u2019re working closely with staff to find suitable redeployment.\u201d\n\nThe Twitter accounts for the two magazines were shut down on Tuesday after Guardian Australia approached Bauer for comment.\n\nThe magazines are still being sold at other convenience stores, as well as Coles and newsagencies.\n\nBut Collective Shout has set its sights on the supermarket giant next.\n\n\u201cThe display and sale of pornographic magazines in the public space creates a hostile environment for women and girls,\u201d campaigns manager Melinda Liszewski said in a statement.\n\n\u201cSexual objectification and sexism creates a culture of violence against women.\n\n\u201cWe urge other retailers selling these magazines \u2014 such as Coles Express \u2014 to follow the example set by 7-Eleven and BP and cease the sale of \u2018unrestricted\u2019 pornographic magazines immediately.\u201d\n\n7-Eleven recently stopped selling the magazines in its 700 convenience stores.\n\nCollective Shout campaigns against the objectification of women and the sexualisation of girls and has been campaigning against the magazines and other titles for a decade.\n\nIt said it ran a successful campaign against \u2018lads mag\u2019 Zoo \u2014 another Bauer title \u2014 four years ago.\n\n\u201cBauer has recognised that society has moved on,\u201d Ms Liszewski said.\n\n\u201cThese sexist titles cannot coexist in a society that claims to care about sexual harassment and other forms of mistreatment of women.\n\n\u201cThe sexist behaviour of the St Kevin\u2019s students just this week is a reflection of boys\u2019 conditioning by a pornified culture. They learn early that women exist for their gratification. We can\u2019t change behaviour without addressing the cultural normalising of it. A sexist culture grooms sexist boys.\n\n\u201cAll the women and girls we represent thank Bauer Media for demonstrating corporate social responsibility. May other companies follow their lead.\u201d", "description": "Two racy magazines will be axed after a social media campaign forced service stations to remove them from shelves.", "authors": ["Stephanie Bedo"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9ed17556ee28e3e285085c13e8b1f02a?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
