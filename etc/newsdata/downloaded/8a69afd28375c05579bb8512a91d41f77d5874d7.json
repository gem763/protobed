The hashtag was used hundreds of thousands of times.\n\nA statement issued Tuesday by the police Technology Crime Suppression Division referred to \u201cinappropriate hashtags\u201d that circulated last week on social networks and were allegedly created by an unscrupulous group of people. It accused the arrested suspect, who was not identified by name in the statement, of posting \u201cinappropriate content\u201d on his Facebook page \u201cspreading hatred.\u201d\n\nThai media reported that Karn\u2019s Facebook post referred to the fall of monarchies in Russia, France and Germany, but not Thailand.\n\nThe police statement said the post received around 100 comments and 50 shares, causing \u201ca number of people to be very upset.\u201d\n\nIn reaction, Minister of Digital Economy and Society Buddhipongse Punnakanta was said to have ordered the police technology division to investigate, leading to the arrest. Police charged Karn under Section 14 of the Computer Crime Act, \u201cposting contents that are a threat to national security,\u201d an offense punishable by up to five years in prison. He was released on bail Tuesday afternoon and ordered by the court not to post similar comments again.\n\nKarn\u2019s lawyer, Winyat Chatmontree, told The Associated Press that his 25-year-old client was arrested for posting about foreign history on his Facebook page on Oct. 2, and took down the post after a few hours when it became controversial.\n\n\u201cI think the authorities want to make an example of him to send a message to others who express their minds freely on many issues,\u201d Winyat said. He said Karn had nothing to do with the motorcade hashtag.\n\nAn arrest was not surprising in view of the attention the hashtag attracted. Digital Economy Minister Buddhipongse announced Sunday that his office and the police would soon arrest those who used offensive words about the Thai royal family. He appeared to be reacting to criticism from royalists who accused him of failing to act.\n\nBuddhipongse said at a news conference Tuesday that while some accused his ministry of not doing enough on the issue, \u201cwe are not targeting anyone in particular and we have done everything by the book and based on facts, especially getting permission from a court of law.\u201d\n\nThailand\u2019s government is headed by Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who as army commander staged a coup in 2014 and headed a military regime that ran the country until this year. A military-backed party won a March election that critics charged was unfair, and Prayuth was reappointed prime minister. The military considers protecting the monarchy one of its major missions.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Police in Thailand have arrested a political activist accused of threatening national security by posting a comment on Facebook about how royal families in other nations lost power.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/08/thailand_politics_04915_c0-190-4665-2909_s1770x1032.jpg?af4025039648b309525d094fa43a9e11eb52f3c2", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
