A big one: college! Campuses are the perfect hunting ground for maniacs targeting young adults who\u2019re out on their own, making bad decisions for the first (and last) time. Here are 11 classics to add to your horror syllabus.\n\nA warning that some of the trailers here are NSFW \u2014 which you might have surmised already, considering the movies we\u2019re talking about here!\n\n11. Splatter University (1984)\n\nIn this ultra low-budget splat-sploitation entry \u2014 which kicks off with a none-too-subtle \u201cstab-happy lunatic escapes the asylum\u201d sequence \u2014 a nervous young sociology professor shows up for her new job at St. Trinian\u2019s College, only to realise the gig has some major drawbacks.\n\nNot only is her new apartment a former crime scene (just a little poisoning murder, nothing to worry about, her busybody landlady assures her), the classroom that she\u2019s assigned has been deemed cursed, since it\u2019s where a teacher was brutally eviscerated by an unknown assailant some months back. Or as a student puts it: \u201cStupid teacher got killed... what a pain in the arse!\u201d\n\nSpeaking of students, Splatter University has an array of loutish dudes and saucy ladies, most sporting spectacularly feathered hair, for the killer to choose from \u2014 and as the body count rises, the rookie prof decides she should try playing detective. All the acting on display here is on par with the rest of the production values, which are pretty rough.\n\nBut nothing says \u201clabour of love and/or dreams of profit\u201d like a slasher movie made for pocket change that still has enough weirdly wicked energy (and a strange last-act twist) that makes it worth watching.\n\n10. Sorority House Massacre (1987)\n\nCarol Frank (who\u2019d worked on 1982's Slumber Party Massacre) wrote and directed this slasher, which takes heavy inspiration from Halloween and The Amityville Horror.\n\nWhen prospective pledge Beth (Angela O\u2019Neill) is invited to spend a long weekend with her potential future sisters, she fails to recognise that the sorority house is actually her former family home. She has amnesia, you see, and can\u2019t recall some major chunks of her childhood. What sort of tragedy would make Beth forget an entire house? How about being the sole survivor after her crazed older brother methodically annihilated the rest of the family? Her crazed older brother, who\u2019s just escaped from the nearby mental hospital, that is?\n\nBefore the events of the movie\u2019s title transpire, because you know they\u2019re coming, there\u2019s time for a totally 1980s dress-up montage, an earnest attempt to interpret Beth\u2019s sudden and intense recurring nightmares (talk about a party pooper), and the discovery that the house\u2019s tragic history is no big secret \u2014 even if Beth somehow takes the entire movie to figure out her connection to it.\n\nSorority House Massacre ventures down some artsy avenues when it illustrates Beth\u2019s flashes of memory, but otherwise it has the bland look and feel of a made-for-TV movie \u2014 albeit one with more boobs and gore than Lifetime would probably allow.\n\n9. Final Exam (1981)\n\nFinal Exam opens with a slasher-movie standard \u2014 a double slaughter on lovers\u2019 lane \u2014 but once it gets to campus, it takes a turn with a scene that feels especially eerie in 2019. After a classroom conversation about Charles Whitman and snipers sets the tone, a van pulls up on the quad and masked men start machine-gunning students at random. Aaah! Except, ha ha! It\u2019s actually a macabre fraternity prank, because mass shootings are hilarious!\n\nSomehow the students at the generically Southern Lanier College manage to shake off that intrusion and focus on the more important things at hand, like doing everything they can to avoid studying for final exams, stupid hazing rituals (like tying a pledge to a tree in his underwear), and \u2014 oh yeah \u2014 the killer who\u2019s shifted from attacking cars in the woods to kids in their dorm rooms. About that last one: Thanks to the prank, the irritated town sheriff proves less inclined to believe any more reports of shocking violence.\n\nIts use of a totally random maniac aside (seriously, he\u2019s never identified or explained; he doesn\u2019t even wear a mask), Final Exam proves pretty by the numbers. But it does have some memorable characters, including a frat guy who lives every moment fully committed to his nickname (\u201cWildman\u201d), and a nerdy type named Radish who\u2019s basically a first-wave true crime fanatic, fond of saying things like \u201cSenseless murders are a modern phenomenon!\u201d\n\n8. Hell Night (1981)\n\nLinda Blair\u2019s intriguing post-Exorcist career included (among many other titles) a couple of TV movies about juvenile delinquents, the legendarily terrible Exorcist II: The Heretic, the majestically campy Roller Boogie, women-in-prison epic Chained Heat, and this slasher flick produced by Halloween\u2019s Irwin Yablans that\u2019s majorly elevated by her presence.\n\nShe plays Marti, the most level-headed and street-smart member of group of fraternity/sorority pledges who\u2019re tasked with spending the night in an abandoned, supposedly haunted mansion as part of a costume party-slash-hazing ritual.\n\nThe place is filled with goofy pranks designed to scare the inebriated partiers \u2014 but it turns out it\u2019s not as abandoned as everyone thinks, and the lurking residents don\u2019t take kindly to trespassers.\n\nRock \u2018n\u2019 Roll High School star Vincent Van Patten pops up as one of the partygoers, but we all know that only a Final Girl, especially one who can hot-wire a car while wearing a frilly Victorian gown, can live through the night.\n\n7. The Initiation (1984)\n\nFuture Melrose Place star Daphne Zuniga gets an \u201cintroducing\u201d credit on this tale of sorority pledges who mischievously break into a giant department store owned by her character\u2019s wealthy father as part of a hazing ritual (the father is played by Return of the Living Dead\u2019s Clu Gulager; her mum is played by Psycho\u2019s Vera Miles).\n\nUnfortunately for everyone, the local asylum has just had a jailbreak, and one of the escaped residents has a particular bone to pick with that very store \u2014 leading to a cat-and-mouse situation in the mall (or rather, the massive but oddly devoid-of-storefronts location The Intiation passes off as a mall) where everyone\u2019s running around after hours.\n\nThat would already be a lot on top of all the sorority-girl cattiness and frat-guy horniness \u2014 which are on full display at an awesomely tacky costume party early in the movie \u2014 but there\u2019s also a subplot about recurring nightmares and repressed memories, tied into a deeply twisted family secret, which is revealed only to be overshadowed by an even more deeply twisted family secret. It\u2019s all very melodramatic and sleazy, and yes, that\u2019s a recommendation.\n\n6. The Dorm That Dripped Blood (1982)\n\nSpeaking of Daphne Zuniga, she made her big-screen debut a couple of years prior to The Initiation in The Dorm That Dripped Blood. Her part is much smaller here, but her death scene \u2014 which sees her discovering the dead bodies of her parents before being run over by a car \u2014 is notably horrific.\n\nThe set-up is that a group of students remain at their otherwise deserted school over winter break, having been hired to clear out an ageing dorm that\u2019s going to be converted into apartments. But of course... they aren\u2019t alone, and the bodies soon start piling up.\n\nThe Dorm That Dripped Blood \u2014 which you might also see under the inferior alternate title Pranks \u2014 has a delightful time introducing all sorts of characters who might fit the psycho-killer bill. Is it the main character\u2019s pushy boyfriend, who\u2019s supposed to be away on a ski trip? The sinister hermit dude who\u2019s been squatting in the otherwise empty building? The leering cowboy who shows up to buy some of the furniture the school is discarding? Or someone else who might be slightly less obvious?\n\nTo the movie\u2019s credit, the true fiend is surprisingly difficult to puzzle out, but it makes perfect sense when revealed.\n\n5. The Prowler (1981)\n\nThirty-five years after the (unsolved) double murder of lovers who slipped out during a dance celebrating the end of World War II, Avalon Bay\u2019s kids decide it\u2019s high time to start holding dances again. However, someone disagrees... and that someone is a masked, well-armed killer dressed in military fatigues.\n\nNobody who\u2019s ever seen a slasher film before will have any trouble whatsoever sussing out who the killer is \u2014 hmm, why does that one character who figures so prominently in the beginning of the film make such a big show of leaving town? \u2014 but The Prowler has ascended to midnight-movie status for a few very good reasons.\n\nOne, it\u2019s directed by Joseph Zito, who went on to make the surprisingly good Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (the one with Corey Feldman and Crispin Glover); and two, the special make-up effects are by gore master Tom Savini \u2014 which is reason enough to add it to your list.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s also an offbeat little chiller \u2014 there\u2019s a Psycho shower homage and the scene where the frantic town deputy calls a nearby resort and encounters a lazily unhelpful desk clerk is so bizarre and perfect \u2014 with random roles for acting notables Lawrence Tierney (Reservoir Dogs) and Farley Granger (Strangers on a Train).\n\n4. Scream 2 (1997)\n\nBefore anyone freaks out, I really wanted to keep this list to the mid-1980s and earlier, which is why more recent campus-horror tales like the Jared Leto/Robert Englund/folklore-stravaganza Urban Legend (1998) and time-loop nightmare Happy Death Day (2017) aren\u2019t included. But it would seem just plain wrong to leave out Scream 2, Wes Craven\u2019s sequel to his phenomenal hit that gave new life to the slasher genre.\n\nTwo years after the gory events in Woodsboro, Final Girl Sidney (Neve Campbell) is at university with her old pal Randy (Jamie Kennedy) \u2014 a movie fanatic who gets a fun rant explaining the \u201crules\u201d of sequels \u2014 when that pesky, phone-toting masked killer returns and starts ripping up her new friends; woe be unto Sidney\u2019s sweet new boyfriend, played by Jerry O\u2019Connell, or the sarcastic sorority girl played by Sarah Michelle Gellar at the height of her Buffy fame.\n\nAs per Randy\u2019s speech, Scream 2 ups the ante and it does so in some clever ways, riffing on the original film\u2019s meta elements by opening with a murder spree at a theatre that\u2019s screening Stab, a movie based on the \u201creal-life\u201d events of the first film.\n\nBut most of the film is set in and around the leafy environs of Windsor College, where Sidney is trying and (spectacularly) failing to move past her tragic high school years \u2014 though she does manage to survive the formidable villains of Scream 2 as well as the two other Scream movies that followed.\n\n3. The House on Sorority Row (1983)\n\nMark Rosman (whose later career included Lindsay Lohan-Tyra Banks doll fantasy Life-Size) co-wrote and directed this suspenseful tale of sorority sisters who do a Very Bad Thing at the beginning of the movie and spend the rest of the time trying to cover it up... until they start getting picked off by a mysterious killer who\u2019s hellbent on revenge.\n\nThe cast includes future soap opera actress and Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Eileen Davidson (fun fact: in real life, she\u2019s married to Hell Night\u2019s Vincent Van Patten), who plays the chief troublemaker among the sisters. It\u2019s her idea to prank their strict housemother when the old hag threatens to interfere with their graduation party \u2014 but the ill-conceived stunt, involving a real gun and the house\u2019s filthy swimming pool, ends up killing the elderly woman. (Naturally, the party goes on as planned.)\n\nThe House on Sorority Row builds up mountains of genuine tension, even bringing in a secondary villain late in the proceedings just in case a psycho stalking around slitting throats wasn\u2019t disturbing enough. There\u2019s also humour \u2014 those sorority girls, so bad at dead-body disposal! \u2014 and some shudder-inducing aesthetic touches, like the deranged killer\u2019s fondness for clowns.\n\n2. Black Christmas (1974)\n\nThe O.G. slasher movie is getting its second remake later this year from director Sophia Takal, but it\u2019d be difficult for even the most inspired reimagining to top the original, which is about a group of sorority sisters who are terrorised by a prank caller who is (spoiler alert) calling from inside the house.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to pick one favourite element in a movie with so many outstanding ones, but the performances \u2014 Olivia Hussey as the no-nonsense Jess; John Saxon as the cop who actually takes the girls\u2019 fears seriously; and especially a pre-Lois Lane Margot Kidder as Jess\u2019 loopy sorority sister, Barb \u2014 are hard to beat.\n\n1. Pieces (1982)\n\nThe title of this Spanish-American cult classic \u2014 whose casual trashiness is only elevated by its very noticeable dubbing \u2014 refers to how the jigsaw puzzle-obsessed killer at the centre of all the chaos prefers to leave his victims. It\u2019s all for a very specific purpose since he\u2019s collecting female body parts to make a patchwork recreation of the mother he chopped up when he was just a little boy.\n\nBut who is the chainsaw-toting grown-up version of the kiddie killer? All of the action in director Juan Piquer Sim\u00f3n\u2019s film centres on a college campus, which has no shortage of potential suspects, not to mention victims, a worrisome situation that inspires the authorities to bring in a beautiful undercover cop (Lynda Day; her real-life husband, Christopher George, plays the local police lieutenant) who also happens to be a famous tennis player.\n\nThat nonsensical bit of character development is par for the course for Pieces, which is filled with intensely gory murders but also has so many startling WTF moments (what college under the sun has a \u201ckung fu professor\u201d?) that you never know what flavour of incredible sleaze is coming next. Make your own \u201chead of the class\u201d joke here; Pieces has earned every single one of \u2019em.", "description": "Slasher movies are famously repetitive, sharing certain themes that recur over and over.
