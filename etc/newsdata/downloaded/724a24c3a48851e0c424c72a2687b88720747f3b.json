Divock Origi went down under a challenge from Victor Lindelof and referee Martin Atkinson was in a perfect position.\n\nHe saw the incident clearly and allowed play to continue. It is debatable if Origi was fouled, and I think Atkinson made the right call by playing on.\n\nVAR was correct not to disallow Marcus Rashford's opener for Manchester United on Sunday\n\nDivock Origi looked to have been fouled in the build up to United's goal but VAR said no\n\nVAR then stood by the original decision of their official on the ground. Liverpool then thought they\u2019d equalised before the break, only for VAR to intervene again.\n\nThis one was straightforward. Television replays showed the ball clearly hit the arm of Sadio Mane in the build-up to the goal.\n\nHe gained an advantage from it, so VAR was right to rule it out.", "description": "MARK CLATTENBURG: Martin Atkinson saw the incident clearly and allowed play to continue.
