Simone Lovera\n\nThe activists, known as \u201cquebradeiras de coco\u201d, have to deal with routine threats and violence from landowners and armed farm workers \u2013 as well as having to battle against sexual harassment, electric fences, fires and the trees being poisoned to carry out their work.\n\nThe unflagged electric fences often lead to women sustaining severe injuries.\n\nMaria Alaides Alves de Sousa, who is the general coordinator of the Interstate Movement of Babassu Coconut Breakers, tells The Independent farmers sometimes steal the axes that the women use to break coconuts. The farmers also cut their baskets so coconuts fall loose and physically seize the baskets from the women.\n\nShe adds: \u201cThey also sometimes scare women with horsewhips. I have heard farmers call coconut breakers \u2018vagabunda\u2019 which means whore or ask, \u2018Don\u2019t you have anything better to be doing?\u2019 or ask their husband, \u2018Don\u2019t you take care of your wife?\u2019 or say, \u2018If you don\u2019t take care of your wife, I will\u2019.\n\n\u201cIn the vast majority of the cases, farmers are men. The farmers themselves are not the ones committing the violence directly. They hire \u2018jaguncos\u2019 or \u2018pistoleiros\u2019 who are gunmen. The formula of this violence is the same everywhere: they first send a message telling the leader to leave the community, then they try intimidation tactics \u2013 such as pretending to run them over, or invading their houses, or throwing the babassu coconut basket after they have collected the coconuts.\u201d\n\nMs Alves de Sousa explains there were several cases of physical violence at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, when land conflicts were \u201cvery intense\u201d.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

There was one emblematic case in [the state of] Tocantins where one woman coconut breaker was tied to a horse and dragged through the fields. She survived because she could hold the rope and managed to hold her neck, but had severe injuries.\u201d\n\nShe says that conflicts have increased between coconut breakers and farmers since the 1990s because indigenous and traditional communities have increasingly had their rights recognised.\n\nThe number of disputes has also risen because conservation NGOs have had their funds reduced, she adds.\n\nShe says: \u201cAfter the most violent period, after the consolidation of land and tenure legalisation, conflicts and aggression became more \u2018sophisticated\u2019 and are now centred on intimidation, threats, property damage \u2013 setting fire to crops or houses, killing of animals \u2013 and invasions.\u201d\n\nMs Alves de Sousa notes the coconut breakers also face sexism within their own communities \u2013 explaining many do not take part in the movement because husbands commonly say women join in to cheat on their spouses.\n\nMaria do Rosario Soares Costa Ferreira, the president of the Babassu Coconut Breakers Interstate Cooperative, is being protected by a national programme for people facing death threats.\n\nThe activists strive to protect the Cerrado savannah and the Amazon with their work \u2013 and are referred to as the guardians of the babassu forests. They are aiming to broaden the Free Babassu Law, which protects palm trees in private properties and bestows them with access.\n\nBut Raimunda Nonata, a coconut breaker from Tocantins, says: \u201cWe know the farmers have relations with politicians or even are politicians.\u201d\n\nMaria Alaides, a 62-year-old who has been a coconut breaker since she was 11, describes the farmers as \u201csexist, authoritarian and violent\u201d.\n\nThe campaigner hit out at Brazil\u2019s new far-right president Jair Bolsonaro \u2013 saying his election made her worried for the future of the planet. She said the current government was making false statements about NGOs and social movements and \u201cgets in the way\u201d of their livelihoods.\n\n\u201cBut even though we have this worry, we will continue our fight for the forest to keep standing,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe will keep striving for the good of the environment and our community and that of the rest of the world. This is a women\u2019s led movement because we want to prove women can organise production and market products and stand side by side with men and guarantee their financial autonomy.\u201d\n\nMs Alves de Sousa says these workers represent a \u201chuge number\u201d of women who are facing \u201cdaily threats to their lives and livelihoods\u201d.\n\nShe adds: \u201cWe want the outside world to understand the impact of trade deals on our communities and support us to protect our forests from deforestation and harmful farming practices that contaminate water supply and poison palm trees.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel Ponte, campaigns adviser for ActionAid Brazil, who supports the coconut breakers, said: \u201cWith 80 per cent of global deforestation down to the expansion of agriculture, countries that consume the meat, soy and sugar cane grown in Brazil have a responsibility to create deforestation-free supply chains that protect the rights and livelihoods of indigenous peoples and traditional communities.\n\n\u201cDeforestation and the destruction of the Amazon and Cerrado biomes are sadly nothing new, but we are reaching a point of no return. We are at risk of losing the world\u2019s most important carbon sink and centre of biodiversity. Babassu coconut breakers and other traditional peoples are on the frontline of the fight to save these vital natural resources. In the face of growing threats from the expansion of agribusiness and the reduction of environmental protections, they need support more than ever.\u201d\n\nThe Brazilian Ministry of Environment was contacted for comment.", "description": "Women fruit-pickers in Brazil\u00a0say they are forced to endure physical, psychological and sexual violence at the hands of farmers.", "authors": ["Maya Oppenheim"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/16/17/coconut-breakers3.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
