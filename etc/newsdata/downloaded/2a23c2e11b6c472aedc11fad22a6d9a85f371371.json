If that changes, their prospects of securing a majority will look dimmer.\n\nAt the moment, a Conservative majority is still the favourite outcome overall, but a narrow one at 10/11. Despite Johnson\u2019s party enjoying a handy poll lead, the odds imply a chance of only a little bit better than 50 per cent. Another hung Parliament is a best priced 11/10, or just under 50 per cent. Every other outcome, including a Labour majority, is a long shot. If Labour had a decent leader it might be different.\n\nThe spread betting markets, however, are saying something slightly different. The mid point of Sporting Index\u2019s spread is 324 Tory seats \u2013 an improvement on the current tally, but still just short of an overall majority. Johnson is still a nailed on 1/6 to win the most seats, an 85 per cent chance (but more about 1/6 racing certainties later).\n\nThere is a theory that suggests you should look at these odds before the polls because betting markets are better at predicting outcomes. People can lie to pollsters and there is plenty of evidence to suggest that they do. This explains the phenomenon of \"shy Tories\". For a number of years polls underestimated Conservative support, which says quite a lot about the way the party is perceived and perhaps about its voters too. When people are putting real cash at risk, however, they\u2019re inclined to be honest.\n\nBut even though political punters tend, as a group, to be savvy and well informed, they don\u2019t always get it right. They didn\u2019t with either the EU referendum or with the last US Presidential election. Leave and Donald Trump were both the outsiders in their two runner fields.\n\nI covered the betting on the 2016 US poll closely. Hillary Clinton had the most money backing her, but Trump attracted far more bets by number, mostly from smaller punters. Partly that was because he looked like value when he was as far out as 9-2 and smaller punters tend to shy away from odds on shots. It\u2019s not much fun putting \u00a350 down to get \u00a315 plus your stake back. But maybe they were on to something.\n\nI spent the evening of that election with Ladbrokes \u2013 and a crazy evening it was too. Clinton\u2019s odds had drifted in the run up to polling day while Trump\u2019s contracted, but she was still a strong favourite. Shortly after the polls closed she looked to have knocked it out of the park. Her odds came in dramatically as the money poured in. At one point Ladbrokes took \u00a3120,00 on her to win at 1-6. There\u2019s that price again. It turned out to be quite a result for the bookie.\n\nBets like that squeezed the price to as short as 1-8 at the night progressed. At that point Matt Shaddick, head of political betting at Ladbrokes, was ordering his cab and I was getting ready to for the pleasure of a drive down a nearly empty A406. Then the results started filtering in from the battleground states in the Mid West, and Florida, where Trump was doing far better than the polling had suggested he would. The cab was cancelled and I was texting my wife so she wouldn\u2019t be alarmed at my absence from the house at 4am, by which time the odds were starting to favour Trump.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long after that he was home and hosed.\n\nElectorates around the world are volatile, and right now Britain\u2019s is especially so. It has more floating voters than ever before. Punters\u2019 views are, meanwhile, often shaped by the echo chambers in which they live. Emotion plays a role, too.\n\nGoing big on a Johnson victory, at this stage, would be a dangerous thing to do.", "description": "It\u2019s bad news for Britain if the betting markets have called it right.
