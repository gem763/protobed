And, although he was talking about his track record with women, it could also apply to some of his lyrics.\n\nNow 74 and happily married to his third wife, Penny Lancaster, a grandad several times over and a knight of the realm, Sir Rod is reflecting on his past and thinking better of some of it.\n\nNot wanting to fall foul of the #MeToo movement, he\u2019s banned certain songs from his repertoire, especially when singing at lucrative corporate gigs.\n\nAnd he\u2019s quite right to do so.\n\nHave you really listened to his lyrics? Take Hot Legs, a textbook example of how women were objectified in 1977. \u2018Hot legs you\u2019re well-equipped/Hot legs oh your p***y\u2019s whipped/Hot legs I just love your lips,\u2019 he croons, while comparing a lover to \u2018an alley cat,\u2019 pointing out that she\u2019s 17, asking her to \u2018bring your mother too\u2019 and wondering \u2018are you still in school?\u2019 It\u2019s all, in a word, gross.\n\nIf young fans were to hear the songs he doesn\u2019t want to perform in front of them, they would surely be repulsed.\n\nRod\u2019s No 1 single Da Ya Think I\u2019m Sexy? was always a bit of a joke, but the lyrics of Tonight\u2019s The Night (\u2018Don\u2019t say a word my virgin child/Just let your inhibitions run wild\u2019) simply aren\u2019t funny.\n\nWho wants to be remembered for songs that people snigger at?\n\nSome older fans may feel horrified that their idol is seeking to self-censor, but I think Rod\u2019s sensibly doing what most women hope men will do following #MeToo: reflecting on his past behaviour towards women and improving it as much as he can.\n\nClinging on to his grosser offerings will only distract future generations from falling in love with his beautiful, evocative voice on the music that should endure.\n\nThis move is going to help his legacy. After all, who wants to be remembered for songs people snigger at?\n\nYES\n\nby Julie Burchill, author and broadcaster\n\nAuthor, Julie Burchill (pictured) argues that young people are offended by everything, its a terrible shame for Rod to clean up his work\n\nThe moment I heard that Sir Rod Stewart was \u2018cleaning up\u2019 his musical repertoire because he feared falling foul of the #MeToo movement, I nearly spat out my suggestive breakfast banana.\n\nSir Rod is also taking this move to ensure he continues to clean up at super-lucrative corporate and private performances.\n\nBut what a terrible shame. When such louche delights as Da Ya Think I\u2019m Sexy? are considered offensive, how long can it be until we start covering up piano legs and leaving the microphone on the stand, lest the handling of it cause arcane desires to arise in susceptible members of the audience?\n\nAccording to a Sunday paper\u2019s \u2018source\u2019: \u2018Lyrics penned in the Seventies and Eighties, when attitudes to sex and courting were very different, do not reflect how [Rod] feels today.\u2019\n\nWe can all imagine how the 74-year-old feels today \u2014 wear and tear is no respecter of heroically notched bedposts, and we all end up making the same noises when we get up as we used to make when we got down.\n\nBut I hope he is taking this vow of aural chastity to save his own blushes, rather than because, as the source said, \u2018in the wake of the ongoing #MeToo movement . . . he would hate to offend any young fans\u2019.\n\nYoung people today are offended (triggered, they call it) by everything, to the extent that they don\u2019t seem to get around to having sex until their mid-20s. Whereas codgers over the age of 65 caused the highest rise in some sexually transmitted infections of any age group last year.\n\nTake away the sex and all you have left is Ed Sheeran\n\nThis is probably because they were adolescents at the birth-in-flames of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll in 1955, when teenagers tore up cinema seats in molten excitement at the sight of Bill Haley\u2019s kiss curl, and Elvis was so incendiary he could be televised only from the waist up.\n\nRock \u2019n\u2019 roll has always been synonymous with sex. Even punk \u2014 as unerotic a musical movement as ever there was \u2014 made waves because its flagship band was called The Sex Pistols.\n\nTake away the bumping, grinding and leering inherent in the best popular music, and what you have left is Ed Sheeran, who surely has the effect of a bucket of cold bromide on any red-blooded music-lover.\n\nTake away the slightly risque suggestion, and you take away much of British music\u2019s charm and sense of fun.\n\nSo I would urge Sir Rod instead to double down on his entendres and amp up the bum-wiggling burlesque.\n\nAlthough, at his age, he should be more worried about having a nasty fall.", "description": "Emily Hill and Julie Burchill shared their views on Rod Stewart scrapping old hits that could cause offence.
