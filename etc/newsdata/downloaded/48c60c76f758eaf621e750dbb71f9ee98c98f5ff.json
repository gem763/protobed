This new option will allow users to play any kind of multiplayer game without the other person needing to be in the same room.\n\nValve revealed the feature, called Remote Play Together on the Steamworks website, which is only accessible to developers. PC Gamer later revealed its existence to the rest of us. Valve\u2019s Alden Kroll described it as such on Twitter: \u201cThis will allow friends to play local co-op games together over the internet as though they were in the same room together.\u201d\n\nSteam Remote Play is its streaming software, which allows you to play games running on your PC on other devices. Previously it\u2019s been something that\u2019d only work with devices hooked up to the same network. Remote Play Together would considerably expand this, as PC Gamer adds, \u201cAll local multiplayer, local co-op and split-screen games will be automatically included in the Remote Play Together beta.\u201d\n\nAdam Spragg, the developer of a stealth party game called Hidden in Plain Sight also revealed more details about the feature from a Valve email, including that it\u2019s intended to \u201cadd value to multiplayer games which do not already have native online capabilities.\u201d That would seem to indicate it\u2019s not going to require any extra work from developers, which is always nice to see.\n\n\"This feature is designed to add value to multiplayer game which do not already have native online capabilities\u2026\" IT ME! \"When the friend accepts an invitation to play, it's as though they're playing side by side at the same machine.\" This is fantastic! \u2014 Adam Spragg (@AdamSpragg) October 9, 2019\n\nIf I had a nickel for every tweet, Reddit thread, or forum post begging for an online multiplayer mode in a game that doesn\u2019t already have it, I\u2019d be rich enough to buy the Half-Life IP and finish it properly.\n\nThe most convenient part \u2014 if you\u2019re like me and most of your gamer friends are only accessible via the internet \u2014 is that apparently only one of you needs to actually own the game. Whomever hosts the session can invite anyone to play alongside them. It\u2019ll apparently work by streaming the host player\u2019s screen to the other players. How surreal will it be to see splitscreen in a game you\u2019re playing online?\n\nPersonally, I look forward to finally tapping the talents of my overseas friends in order to help me beat Cuphead\u2018s Hard Mode. Y\u2019all know who you are: your time is nigh.\n\nAccording to Polygon, Remote Play Together will enter the Steam beta week after next.", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2017%2F12%2Fcuphead.png&signature=bb7cb73b2b619b2216b3d41c4afc6664", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
