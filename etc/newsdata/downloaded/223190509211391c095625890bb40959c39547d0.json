The two casters \u2014 esports commentators \u2014 who appeared alongside Blitzchung in the interview will also \"not work with Blizzard anymore,\" according to the company.\n\nThe player, whose real name is Chung Ng Wai, was participating in the Hearthstone Grandmasters regular season, an esports tournament in which players play Hearthstone, the turn-based online card game developed by Blizzard.\n\nOn Sunday, the esports publication Inven Global tweeted out footage of Blitzchung's post-match interview on the official Taiwanese Hearthstone stream. Blizzard has since deleted footage of the interview from its official channels.\n\nDuring the interview, Blitzchung appears wearing a gas mask, which he lifts up before shouting \"Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age!\" in Chinese, as verified by Polygon.\n\n\u2014\ud83c\udf83 Inven Global \ud83c\udf83 (@InvenGlobal) October 6, 2019\n\nAfter Blitzchung's exclamation, his two casters look down, seemingly in an attempt to distance themselves from his remarks. Blitzchung later told Inven Global it was his \"duty\" to speak out about the Hong Kong protests.\n\n\"As you know, there are serious protests in my country now,\" he said. \"My call on stream was just another form of participation of the protest that I wish to grab more attention. I put so much effort in that social movement in the past few months that I sometimes couldn't focus on preparing my Grandmaster match.\n\n\"I know what my action on stream means. It could cause me lot of trouble, even my personal safety in real life,\" he told the publication.\n\nBlizzard is a US-based company, where free speech is protected by the First Amendment of the US Constitution, but it also operates in authoritarian China thanks to a partnership with one of its China-based investors, Tencent. China only issues a certain number of game licenses a year, and US-based companies often partner with game companies based in the country as a way to access the vast market and grow their sales \u2014 but partnerships like that oftentimes lead to a clash of values.\n\nThe situation highlights the thorny tradeoff US-based companies face when operating in China: It's a hugely profitable opportunity, but placating the Chinese government can require compromising on fundamental democratic values that in turn risks backlash elsewhere in the world.\n\nTellingly, Blizzard investor Tencent is also the owner of the Houston Rockets NBA team, whose general manager Daryl Morey faced major backlash in China after tweeting in support of the Hong Kong protesters on Friday.\n\nThe Houston Rockets' general manager, Daryl Morey. Bob Levey/Getty Images\n\nSeveral of the Rockets' Chinese sponsors and partners, including the state broadcaster China Central Television and Tencent's livestreaming platform, Tencent Sports, have since said they will no longer broadcast Rockets games. Morey himself has since deleted the tweet and said he did not mean to \"cause any offence,\" but the damage seems to have been done. The backlash can be considered especially ominous given the NBA's popularity in China, where it is the country's most-watched sports league.\n\nThe TV show \"South Park\" is another recent example of a US-based product angering the nation state. After a recent episode saw the character Randy visit a Chinese re-education camp and endure forced labor, the show has reportedly been banned in China. The show promptly issued a mock apology through the show's Twitter account.\n\nElsewhere in the tech industry, Google's parent company, Alphabet was recently criticized by its own employees and US lawmakers for quietly working on a version of the Google search engine designed for the Chinese market that would censor its results. The company has since said it's stopped work on the controversial project.\n\nBlizzard, announcing the bans, did not address whether Tencent or the Chinese government influenced its decision. Instead, the reason it gave was that Blitzchung violated the rules of its competition, specifically this rule:\n\nEngaging in any act that, in Blizzard's sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player's prize total to $0 USD, in addition to other remedies which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzard's Website Terms.\n\nBlizzard appears to be arguing that Blitzchung's statements about the Hong Kong protests offended \"a portion or group of the public\" or damaged the company's image. Blizzard did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment. The company has disabled comments on its blog post announcing the ban.\n\nNow, the company must grapple with the backlash from those outside of China arguing Blizzard compromised on a basic human right \u2014 free speech \u2014 out of fear of a potential fallout with China and its lucrative market.", "description": "Blizzard Entertainment has sent the esports player known as Blitzchung home from a tournament and handed him a 12-month ban for making the remarks.", "authors": ["Charlie Wood"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9c9f47138e4a4bd64bcc38?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
