In fact, some professors at the University of Kansas feel so strongly that the Christian company is a hatemongering behemoth of evil, that they are demanding their school boycott and remove the sandwich chain from their campus.\n\nThe Kansas City Star reports that Chick-Fil-A previously had a spot tucked away in the basement of an obscure building on campus. But, after a new contract, the eatery was moved to a new and improved location. The business was also given a new sponsorship via \"Chick-Fil-A coin flip\" before every home football game the next three years.\n\nKU\u2019s Sexuality & Gender Diversity Faculty and Staff Council sent a letter to Chancellor Doug Girod this week, saying \"KU granted Chick-fil-A, a bastion of bigotry, a prime retail location in the heart of our campus.\"\n\n\"Moving Chick-fil-A to the Union and granting it a role at the start of all home football games violates the feelings of safety and inclusion that so many of us have striven to create, foster, and protect on campus, and sends a message that the Union, KU Athletics, and the administration at large are more concerned about money and corporate sponsorship than the physical, emotional, and mental well being of marginalized and LGBTQ people,\" the professors added.\n\n\"The culture of Chick-fil-A fosters hate and discrimination on multiple levels. In short, Chick-fil-A on KU\u2019s campus stands in direct contrast to the university\u2019s mission of fostering a multicultural, inclusive environment,\" they declared.\n\nThe founder of Chick-Fil-A, Truett Cathy, was a devout Christian who believed in traditional marriage. Every employee is trained in line with Christian teaching. The alleged culture of hate the professors accuse the sandwich chain of creating includes employees who change customer's tires in the drive-thru lane, feed disabled customers, and always say \"My pleasure\" when a patron says \"Thank you.\"", "description": ".09/02/2019 3:18:12AM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/239/b88c5a10-e6ef-4081-a497-71618c0acbef.png"}
