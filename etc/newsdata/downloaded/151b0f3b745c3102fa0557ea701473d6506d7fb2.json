The race was widely viewed as a 2020 bellwether. Screen grab via his Twitter page.\n\nRepublican State Senator Dan Bishop has been declared by multiple media outlets to be the winner of North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional district race against Democrat Dan McCready:\n\nAP calls it for Bishop. 2 point win for the GOP in #NC09. \u2014 Geoffrey Skelley (@geoffreyvs) September 11, 2019\n\nThis celebratory video was posted on Bishop\u2019s Twitter feed moments later:\n\nWE DID IT #NC09!!!! Thank you North Carolina!!! \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 pic.twitter.com/hMohQZGl4w \u2014 Dan Bishop (@jdanbishop) September 11, 2019\n\nTrump is, of course, taking a share of the credit. Heh:\n\nDan Bishop was down 17 points 3 weeks ago. He then asked me for help, we changed his strategy together, and he ran a great race. Big Rally last night. Now it looks like he is going to win. @CNN & @MSNBC are moving their big studio equipment and talent out. Stay tuned! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 11, 2019\n\nAs of this writing, Bishop is ahead by about 4,000 votes with all but two precincts reporting. Via Politico:\n\nMcCready has conceded:\n\nIn advance of today\u2019s contest, the race had been widely portrayed as a bellwether race for 2020 by the mainstream media and Democratic political analysts. Will be interesting to see how they spin it now that the Republican has won.\n\nMcCready also had a big money advantage over Bishop, but in the end he came up short.\n\nHere\u2019s a roundup of news/commentary/reactions on the race from pollsters, Democrats, Republicans, (disappointed) journalists, etc:\n\nRepublican @jdanbishop Wins the North Carolina Special Congressional Election..

This was an Obama -> Trump county that McCready won by 15% in 2018. It nearly flipped tonight, with the Lumbee Indian precincts (in the west) moving most heavily GOP. #ncpol pic.twitter.com/17Ci590wgk \u2014 J. Miles Coleman (@JMilesColeman) September 11, 2019\n\nBut even as McCready improved in the burbs tonight, he performed worse in many of the rural precincts and even in decent-sized towns like Lumberton. The Dems' rural and non-college difficulties continue. \u2014 Jonathan Martin (@jmartNYT) September 11, 2019\n\nThe \u201cStacey Abrams won\u201d wing of the Democratic party has some thoughts:\n\nBishop was heavily outspent by McCready but moral victory or something. #ncpol #nc09 pic.twitter.com/NiAskV0a0p \u2014 Sister Toldjah \ud83d\ude01 (@sistertoldjah) September 11, 2019\n\nBut here\u2019s the reality of what the situation on the ground here has been like:\n\nIt was. Bishop had to overcome the #NC09 absentee ballot harvesting scandal that sunk Harris.\n\nPlus, HB2. Plus any anti-Trump sentiment.\n\nSo, yeah \u2013 it was a big win.\n\nConsider what you'd be tweeting right now had he lost.#NCpol https://t.co/Agu9UpXmXj \u2014 Pete Kaliner (@PeteKaliner) September 11, 2019\n\nNC 11th Congressional district Rep. Mark Meadows (R) weighs in:\n\nHuge night for North Carolina. Massive win for @realDonaldTrump and conservative values. @DrGregMurphy1 and @jdanbishop CONGRATULATIONS on outstanding races and job well done\u2014now let\u2019s get to work! #NC09 #NC03 #NCpol \u2014 Mark Meadows (@MarkMeadows) September 11, 2019\n\nBishop is already on it:\n\nBishop calls on D\u2019s in US House to approve more funding to build the border wall w/ Mexico #ncpol #nc09 \u2014 Nick Ochsner (@NickOchsnerWBTV) September 11, 2019\n\nJust a reminder: This race is the last race of the 2018 election cycle. Bishop will have to turn around in a few months and begin campaigning again for the seat for the 2020 election cycle:\n\nThe 2018 #NC09 election will be decided tonight The 2020 #NC09 election will start in less than 3 months Filing for 2020 races opens December 2 #ncpol pic.twitter.com/OOWhUMurKh \u2014 Joe Bruno (@JoeBrunoWSOC9) September 10, 2019\n\nEnjoy these next few weeks of no political ads while you can, my fellow North Carolinians. \ud83d\ude09\n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\n\u2014 Based in North Carolina, Sister Toldjah is a former liberal and a 15+ year veteran of blogging with an emphasis on media bias, social issues, and the culture wars.
