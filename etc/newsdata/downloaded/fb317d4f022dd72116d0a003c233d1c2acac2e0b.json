The short-dated maturity marked its biggest daily drop in two months.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury note yield fell 6.3 basis points to 1.531%, while the 30-year bond yield slipped 4.7 basis points to 2.035%.\n\nSee: The yield curve is steepening, and that's not good for investors. Here's why (link)\n\nWhat's driving Treasurys?\n\nInvestors dived into government paper after data underlined the deteriorating health of the service sector, a large chunk of the U.S. economy.
