Priscilla Chan, Zuckerberg\u2019s wife, also sent multiple emails to Schmuhl with staff recommendations. Ultimately, two of the people recommended were hired.\n\nThe emails between Zuckerberg and Buttigieg have come to light as Zuckerberg faces unrelenting attacks from politicians from both parties over such issues as misinformation, privacy, election meddling and bias. Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee on Facebook\u2019s impact on the financial services and housing sectors.\n\nZuckerberg used to make political contributions more frequently, including to former and current House speakers Paul Ryan and Nancy Pelosi in 2014, but he hasn\u2019t made any political donations or endorsements to specific candidates in the 2020 election cycle. In June, he gave $5,000 to Facebook\u2019s PAC, which contributes to both Democratic and Republican candidates.\n\n\u2018Top-Tier Organization\u2019\n\n\u201cSince the beginning of the campaign, we\u2019ve built a top-tier operation with more than 430 staff in South Bend and around the country,\u201d Meagher said. \u201cThe staffers come from all types of background, and everyone is working hard every day to elect Pete to the White House.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the Zuckerberg-Chan family told Bloomberg News that the employees asked the tech mogul and Chan to recommend them.\n\n\u201cHaving seen Mark\u2019s visit to South Bend in 2017 and Facebook Live with Mayor Buttigieg, colleagues later asked Mark and Priscilla to connect them with the Buttigieg campaign as they were interested in joining,\u201d spokesman Ben LaBolt said in a statement. Zuckerberg visited South Bend, Indiana, in April 2017 as part of his philanthropic work and got a tour from Buttigieg, that Zuckerberg live-streamed.\n\n\u201cMark and Priscilla have not decided who to support for President,\u201d he added.\n\nLaBolt didn\u2019t answer a follow-up question asking whether Zuckerberg has made similar connections for other candidates.\n\nMaking Introductions\n\nIn the emails, Zuckerberg and Chan recommended numerous potential campaign hires, and two of them are now on staff: Eric Mayefsky, senior digital analytics adviser, and Nina Wornhoff, organizing data manager.\n\nMayefsky previously worked as the director of data science at Quora, a 10-year-old question-and-answer startup founded by former Facebook employees. Mayefsky worked at Facebook for almost four years starting in 2010, according to his LinkedIn profile. Wornhoff previously worked as a machine learning engineer at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and in Democratic politics in Indiana, Buttigieg\u2019s home state.\n\nThe communication was initiated by Zuckerberg and Chan, Meagher said. It was sent shortly after Buttigieg officially launched his campaign in mid-April.\n\n\u201cFrom the CNN Town hall in March to our launch a month later, we literally got 7,000 resumes,\u201d Meagher said. \u201cI think that he (Zuckerberg) thought Eric would be a good staff hire with a lot of experience and same with Nina and Priscilla.\u201d\n\nCrimson Connection\n\nZuckerberg, 35, and Buttigieg, 37, overlapped at Harvard, and Buttigieg was friends with two of Zuckerberg\u2019s roommates. He was also one of Facebook\u2019s first 300 users. But they were only introduced years later by a mutual Harvard friend.\n\nThe staff recommendations from Zuckerberg are the first evidence of the Facebook CEO actively assisting a presidential campaign. A number of other high-ranking Facebook executives, including David Marcus, the executive leading Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency efforts, Naomi Gleit, one of Facebook\u2019s longest-tenured executives, and Chris Cox, former chief product officer who is close friends with Zuckerberg, have donated to Buttigieg.\n\nIn recent weeks, Democrats have escalated their criticism of Facebook for its refusal to moderate political ads. Elizabeth Warren, in particular, has repeatedly attacked Zuckerberg and Facebook over its decision not to fact check posts or ads shared by politicians. Joe Biden wrote the company on Thursday demanding that an ad paid for by a pro-Donald Trump super-PAC be pulled down for what he said were lies about his Ukrainian-related work as vice president.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg has privately recommended several potential hires to Pete Buttigieg\u2019s presidential campaign, a rare example of direct political involvement from one of tech\u2019s most powerful executives.Earlier this year, Zuckerberg sent multiple emails", "authors": ["Tyler Pager", "Kurt Wagner"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SEYL0fls_Mu4UG7NBsLbNQ--~B/aD0xNTAwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/76e148c61c45d067b43609f5599540f4", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
