General Assembly gathering in New York, the State Department\u2019s point man on Iran, Brian Hook, said that last week\u2019s attacks \u201cwere more complex, larger in scale, and more precise than anything the [Iranian-backed Houthi rebels] are capable of executing.\u201d\n\nThe administration has announced another round of economic sanctions on Iran in response to the attack that rocked the global oil industry. Iran has denied it is responsible for the attack, and Iran-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen claim they carried out the strikes in retaliation for a Saudi-led military campaign against them.\n\nBut the Trump administration\u2019s case against Teheran received a major boost when the leaders of Britain, France and Germany \u2014 all of whom still support the 2015 nuclear deal repudiated by Mr. Trump last year \u2014 said in New York they agreed with the U.S. that Iran was behind the attacks.\n\nIn a joint statement Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that it was \u201cclear to us that Iran bears responsibility for this attack. There is no other plausible explanation.\u201d\n\nMr. Hook said the Saudi attack was proof that the U.S. policy of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d was having a clear impact on Iran, which he said was lashing out as its economic woes deepen.\n\n\u201cOur pressure is making the regime\u2019s extremist foreign policy and the ideology that drives it more expensive than ever before,\u201d Mr. Hook said. \u201cThis was long overdue.\u201d\n\nMr. Hook, who was speaking at the Asia Society in New York, declared that \u201caccepting the Iranian version of events undermines international security and conveniently demands nothing of nations in response.\u201d\n\nMr. Hook\u2019s comments come just days after the Defense Department announced it is deploying a small contingent of troops to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to as a defensive measure against future attacks. Mr. Trump has been under fire from some conservative critics on Capitol Hill to make a more forceful response, including a military strike against Iranian targets.\n\nBut in a Friday evening press conference, Secretary of Defense Mark T. Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Joseph F. Dunford said the deployment will involve fewer than 100 American troops and will primarily be focused on air and missile defense.\n\nThe announcement was met with criticism from several Democratic lawmakers. Sen. Edward Markey, Massachusetts Democrat, on Monday said the deployment is \u201crisking unnecessary conflict.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are in this situation because President Trump believes America must defend Saudi oil interests, inviting escalation and putting American servicemembers in harm\u2019s way,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nUpon his arrival for this week\u2019s U.N. General Assembly meetings Monday afternoon, President Trump kept the door open to a potential meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, although he has previously rejected the idea.\n\nBut Iranian officials have been adamant such a meeting could not happen so long as harsh U.S. sanctions remain on their economy and the Trump administration refuses to honor the 2015 deal.\n\nMr. Rouhani is set to address the U.N. gathering in New York on Wednesday, when officials in Teheran say he will detail a proposed \u201cHormuz Peace Plan,\u201d designed to de-escalate tensions in the Persian Gulf.\n\nWhile the European leaders placed the blame for the Sept. 8 Saudi strike on Iran, they also urged Iran to enter into talks on a new deal, and said President Trump should be open to a new overture for talks.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one guy who can do a better deal,\u201d Mr. Johnson told reporters. \u201cAnd that is the president of the United States. I hope there will be a Trump deal.\u201d\n\n\u2022 This article was based in part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
