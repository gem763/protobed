All this made for a huge and happy meal for dozens of vultures.'\n\nPark authorities investigating the death of the elephant and crocodile\n\nWhile elephants outweigh crocodiles by a considerable margin, the reptiles have attacked young or vulnerable elephants in the past.\n\nNile crocodiles are often seen in the Luangwa River and prey on elephants crossing the river or drinking from the banks.\n\nThe reptiles can reach up to 20ft in length and weigh up to 1,650 lbs while African Elephants can grow up to 10.8ft and weigh between 5,000 and 14,000 lbs.\n\nCrocodiles are likely to strike and target elephants who appear young, ill or visibly injured.\n\nAgata Staniewicz, a crocodile researcher and doctoral candidate at the University of Bristol, said: 'Crocodiles are ambush predators, and when they lunge at an elephant they usually grab its vulnerable trunk.'\n\nHowever the injured elephant may not have been able to vend off the reptile and collapsed on top of it with exhaustion, crushing the crocodile to death.\n\nMarisa Tellez, co-founder of the Crocodile Research Coalition, said: 'From the pictures I've seen, the crocodile was a small sub adult or small adult, and I highly doubt it was trying to take an injured adult elephant down.\n\n'That seems like a lot of work for a smaller predator, and not in its favor', she told LiveScience.\n\n'Of course, you will always have more bold individuals that will take more than they bargained for,' Ms Tellez added.\n\n'I am also wondering if this may have been a young female defending her nest from an elephant possibly trampling all over it.'\n\nThe Department of National Parks and Wildlife and Conservation South Luangwa officials ruled out poaching after no bullets were found and said both animals appeared to be young based on their size.", "description": "A large elephant carcass was found on top of a squashed Nile crocodile after the mammal is likely to have collapsed on the reptile at the Island Bush Camp next to the Luangwa River in Zambia.", "authors": ["Emily Webber For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/18/19894776-0-image-a-2_1571419824901.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
