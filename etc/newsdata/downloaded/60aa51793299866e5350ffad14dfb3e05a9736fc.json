Bill Barr now finds himself at the center of questions about a Trump call with the Australian PM. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nDRIVING THE DAY\n\nTHE STORY EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT -- \u201cTrump Pressed Australian Leader to Help Barr Investigate Mueller Inquiry\u2019s Origins,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Mark Mazzetti and Katie Benner: \u201cPresident Trump pushed the Australian prime minister during a recent telephone call to help Attorney General William P. Barr gather information for a Justice Department inquiry that Mr. Trump hopes will discredit the Mueller investigation, according to two American officials with knowledge of the call.\n\n\u201cThe White House curbed access to a transcript of the call \u2014 which the president made at Mr. Barr\u2019s request \u2014 to a small group of aides, one of the officials said. The restriction was unusual and similar to the handling of a July call with the Ukrainian president that is at the heart of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cLike that call, Mr. Trump\u2019s discussion with Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia shows the president using high-level diplomacy to advance his personal political interests.\n\n\u201cThe discussion with Mr. Morrison shows the extent to which Mr. Trump views the attorney general as a crucial partner: The president is using federal law enforcement powers to aid his political prospects, settle scores with his perceived \u2018deep state\u2019 enemies and show that the Mueller investigation had corrupt, partisan origins.\u201d NYT\n\n-- WAPO\u2019S DEVLIN BARRETT, SHANE HARRIS and MATT ZAPOTOSKY: \u201cBarr has already made overtures to British intelligence officials, and last week the attorney general traveled to Italy, where he and Durham met senior Italian government officials and Barr asked the Italians to assist Durham, according to one person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue. It was not Barr\u2019s first trip to Italy to meet intelligence officials, the person said.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration has made similar requests of Australia, said people who discussed the interactions on the condition of anonymity because they involve an ongoing investigation and sensitive talks between governments.\u201d WaPo\n\n-- FLASHBACK: Barr was spotted in Playbook PM on Aug. 15 at the Rome Marriott Grand Flora Hotel. Barr, who was dressed in a suit, was accompanied by multiple staffers and had a significant security detail presence as he was whisked into the hotel.\n\nHMM \u2026 \u201cPompeo Took Part in Ukraine Call, Official Says,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Courtney McBride and Sadie Gurman: \u201cSecretary of State Mike Pompeo was among the administration officials who listened in on the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president, a senior State Department official said Monday, a disclosure that ties the State Department more closely to the House impeachment inquiry.\u201d WSJ\n\nA message from Goldman Sachs 10,000 Women: Since 2008, Goldman Sachs has trained and empowered women business owners in developing economies through our 10,000 Women program, with 70% of graduates reporting higher revenues and nearly 60% creating new jobs in their communities. Learn more about our ongoing commitment to women entrepreneurs.\n\nSCOOP -- ALEX ISENSTADT: \u201cTrump grievance machine reaps millions off impeachment\u201d: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s campaign aides expected months ago that Democrats would try to impeach the president \u2014 and he needed a way to exploit it. So this summer, Trump 2020 officials spliced news clips of Democrats discussing impeachment into a 90-second video montage, punctuated by the president imploring supporters to help him \u2018stop this nonsense.\u2019\n\n\u201cAides quietly filed the spot away until last week, when it was released it as part of an online counteroffensive to the impeachment push that brought in 50,000-plus new donors and raked in $8.5 million in two days \u2014 the campaign\u2019s biggest digital haul since its June launch.\n\n\u201cThe push demonstrates how Trump, in less than three years in office, has perfected a grievance machine that converts deep-seated outrage on the right into fundraising dollars and new support. As Trump confronts the gravest threat to his presidency yet, his campaign is stoking \u2014 and monetizing \u2014 the anger of a Republican base that has long seen the president as under siege.\u201d POLITICO \u2026 The spot\n\n-- \u201cTrump is using Facebook to run thousands of ads about impeachment,\u201d by CNN\u2019s Donie O\u2019Sullivan and David Wright: \u201cPresident Donald Trump is using his powerful social media presence to push back against the impeachment inquiry, tweeting and retweeting more than 100 times over the weekend and his reelection campaign has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on Facebook ads on the topic over the past week.\n\n\u201cMore than 1,800 ads on Trump\u2019s Facebook page mentioning \u2018impeachment\u2019 have run in the past seven days. The ads have been viewed between 16 and 18 million times on Facebook and the campaign has spent between $600,000 and $2,000,000 on the effort, according to data analyzed by Laura Edelson, a researcher at New York University\u2019s Tandon School of Engineering. The President is using ads to enlist people in what his campaign is calling the \u2018Official Impeachment Defense Task Force.\u2019\u201d CNN\n\nWAR ROOM? WHAT WAR ROOM? -- \u201cTrump team battles over impeachment war room,\u201d by Nancy Cook and Darren Samuelsohn: \u201cA week after House Democrats jump-started their impeachment inquiry, the White House has yet to converge on any single plan, strategy or even unified messaging to fight back.\n\n\u201cAll the talk about setting up a so-called war room inside the West Wing, similar to the approach of the Clinton White House, has gone nowhere. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, other top aides, lawyers and Trump advisers have been jockeying among their own internal factions for control of the approach or messaging. And President Donald Trump has expressed little interest in responding to House Democrats in such a conventional manner, preferring to deploy his own messaging on Twitter.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- WAPO: \u201cTrump amps up attacks on whistleblower as some Republicans call for more strategic response to impeachment\u201d\n\n-- MEL ZANONA: \u201cGOP maps out impeachment defense amid messaging stumbles\u201d: \u201cHouse Republicans are scrambling to hash out a unified strategy to defend President Donald Trump as the GOP struggles to respond to the rapidly-moving impeachment probe. With Democrats aggressively pushing ahead with their impeachment inquiry, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) convened a conference call on Monday afternoon where he urged members of his leadership team and GOP committee leaders to get on the same messaging page, according to multiple lawmakers and aides.\n\n\u201cMcCarthy implored his troops to stay focused on communicating that there is nothing that rises to the level of impeachment in the president\u2019s July phone call with Ukraine, when Trump urged the Ukrainian president to investigate the Biden family. \u2026 But the party has more broadly faced some messaging stumbles over the last week, fueling anxiety among Republicans that they don\u2019t have a clear vision to guard against impeachment.\u201d POLITICO\n\nGood Tuesday morning.\n\nRACE TO WATCH -- Dan Feehan is launching his campaign against GOP Rep. Jim Hagedorn in Minnesota\u2019s 1st District. The race will be a rematch between the two, who battled in 2018 for an open seat that had been held by Democratic Rep. Tim Walz. Hagedorn took in 50.2% of the vote, compared to Feehan with 49.8%. Campaign video launch\n\nPlaybook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

Another 41% said that Trump should not be impeached and 15% said they \u2018don\u2019t know.\u2019\u201d Reuters\n\n-- \u201cSupport for impeaching Trump rises among independents and Republicans,\u201d by CNN\u2019s Jennifer Agiesta: \u201cAmericans are about evenly split over impeaching President Donald Trump and removing him from office, as support for that move has risen among independents and Republicans, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS after the announcement of a formal impeachment inquiry by House Democrats last week.\n\n\u201cAbout half, 47%, support impeaching the president and removing him from office, up from 41% who felt that way in a CNN poll in May. The current level matches the high point for impeaching Trump in previous CNN polling -- 47% said they felt that way in September 2018.\u201d CNN ... The full poll\n\n-- BUT, BUT, BUT: \u201cHow A Big Enough News Story \u2014 Like Impeachment \u2014 Could Warp The Polls,\u201d by \u201cMystery Pollster\u201d Mark Blumenthal for FiveThirtyEight\n\nNEXT UP: \u201cDemocrats subpoena Giuliani as Trump lashes out,\u201d by Andrew Desiderio: \u201cThe House Intelligence Committee on Monday issued a subpoena to Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney, as part of House Democrats\u2019 rapidly intensifying impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThe subpoena, issued in consultation with the House Foreign Affairs and Oversight panels, seeks documents related to Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate 2020 contender and former Vice President Joe Biden. The committees demanded details about Giuliani\u2019s interactions with Trump administration officials regarding his activities in the eastern European nation as a potential intermediary between the American and Ukrainian governments.\u201d POLITICO\n\nA message from Goldman Sachs 10,000 Women: Explore the stories of our 10,000 Women graduates and find out how they're generating revenue and creating jobs in their communities.\n\n2020 WATCH -- CHRIS CADELAGO: \u201cKamala Harris shakes up flailing campaign\u201d\n\n-- \u201cDemocrats plead for campaign cash as third quarter closes,\u201d by AP\u2019s Brian Slodysko: \u201cWith the Iowa caucuses approaching in February, there\u2019s a growing sense of urgency as the primary becomes a fierce battle for a limited pool of cash that could make the difference between staying in the race and heading for the exits.\n\n\u201cThose who continue to muddle along in the lower tier will not only face challenges paying for advertising to amplify their message, but they are also likely to struggle reaching fundraising thresholds set by the Democratic National Committee to qualify for future debates.\u201d AP\n\nTRUMP\u2019S TUESDAY -- The president will meet with Defense Secretary Mike Esper at 4 p.m. in the Oval Office.\n\nPLAYBOOK READS\n\nPHOTO DU JOUR: The coffin of former French President Jacques Chirac is carried out of his last service in Paris on Monday. | Francois Mori, Pool/AP Photo\n\nKNOWING RACHEL MADDOW -- \u201cThis Is the Moment Rachel Maddow Has Been Waiting For,\u201d by NYT Magazine\u2019s Amanda Hess: \u201cHow the MSNBC host staked her show on Trump \u2014 and won the largest and most obsessive audience of her career.\u201d NYT Magazine\n\nTHE INVESTIGATIONS ...\n\n-- \u201cTrump may have lied to Mueller, House Democrats say,\u201d by Andrew Desiderio: \u201cLawyers for the House of Representatives revealed on Monday that they have reason to believe that the grand-jury redactions in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report show that President Donald Trump lied about his knowledge of his campaign\u2019s contacts with WikiLeaks.\n\n\u201cThe attorneys made the stunning suggestion in a court filing as part of the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s bid for Mueller\u2019s grand-jury materials, which have remained secret by law. \u2018Not only could those materials demonstrate the president\u2019s motives for obstructing the special counsel\u2019s investigation, they also could reveal that Trump was aware of his campaign\u2019s contacts with WikiLeaks,\u2019 the lawyers wrote in the filing, which was in response to the Justice Department\u2019s opposition to the disclosure of the grand-jury information.\n\n\u201cTo back up their claim, the House\u2019s legal team \u2014 led by House General Counsel Douglas Letter \u2014 cited a passage in Mueller\u2019s report about former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort\u2019s testimony that he \u2018recalled\u2019 Trump asking to be kept \u2018updated\u2019 about WikiLeaks\u2019 disclosures of Democratic National Committee emails. There is a grand-jury redaction in that passage, the lawyers note.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- JOSH GERSTEIN: \u201cMichael Flynn\u2019s lawyers dismiss his Turkey lobbying admissions as \u2018meaningless\u2019\u201d: \u201cThe defense team for former national security adviser Michael Flynn is entirely dismissing admissions he made as part of his guilty plea two years ago that he provided false information to the Justice Department about work he did for Turkish interests while serving as a top adviser to the Trump presidential campaign in 2016.\n\n\u201cFlynn\u2019s attorneys argued in a court filing Monday that a judge\u2019s decision last week overturning a jury\u2019s guilty verdicts on related charges against Flynn\u2019s business partner Bijan Rafiekian \u2018renders meaniningless\u2019 the concessions Flynn made under oath during his December 2017 guilty plea.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- \u201cU.S. to Join Trump Lawsuit Seeking to Block Disclosure of Tax Returns,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Corinne Ramey: \u201cThe U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan said Monday that the U.S. would participate in a lawsuit filed by President Trump that seeks to block a subpoena for eight years of his tax returns.\n\n\u201cIn a brief letter to the judge, U.S. Attorney for Manhattan Geoffrey Berman and Jeffrey Oestericher, chief of the office\u2019s civil division, said the U.S. would file a submission in the case by Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe letter comes in a dispute over a subpoena that the office of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. sent to accounting firm Mazars USA LLP requesting the president\u2019s personal and business tax returns dating to 2011.\u201d WSJ\n\nBACKSTORY -- \u201cHow Iran\u2019s President Left Trump Hanging, and Macron in the Hall,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Farnaz Fassihi and Rick Gladstone: \u201cThe telephone line had been secretly set up. President Trump waited on the other end. All President Hassan Rouhani of Iran had to do was come out of his hotel suite and walk into a secure room where Mr. Trump\u2019s voice would be piped in via speaker.\n\n\u201cMr. Rouhani and his aides were blindsided by the offer, presented to them by President Emmanuel Macron of France on an unannounced visit last Tuesday night to their quarters at the Millenium Hilton Hotel near the United Nations, where world leaders had converged for the annual General Assembly.\u201d NYT\n\n-- MORE from Robin Wright, who broke the story in The New Yorker: \u201cThe call to Trump\u2019s line came through at nine-thirty, according to sources familiar with events that evening. Macron took the call.
