Atatiana was a beautiful, smart, amazing young woman by all accounts, who was unjustly taken from her family,\u201d Fort Worth Mayor Betsy Price told a news conference.\n\nShe said an independent panel of experts would review the incident, adding: \u201cAs a mother, a grandmother, a sister, an aunt, I can\u2019t imagine anything worse and I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\nFort Worth interim police chief Ed Kraus made Dean\u2019s name public, and promised \u201ca thorough and transparent and speedy investigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy intent was to meet with him today to terminate his employment with the Fort Worth Police Department. However, the officer tendered his resignation this morning before we met,\u201d Kraus said.\n\nKraus said Dean faced criminal charges and an FBI probe for \u201cpossible civil rights violations.\u201d\n\nJefferson\u2019s brother Darius Carr demanded tougher immediate action, however.\n\n\u201cThis man murdered someone. He should be arrested,\u201d Carr told reporters.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Take it to the streets\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe shooting came after a neighbor called police to report that Jefferson\u2019s front and side doors were lying ajar.\n\nPolice body-cam footage showed two officers with flashlights walking quietly around the property before spotting someone standing inside near a window.\n\nFamily attorney Lee Merritt said the victim had heard sounds in the backyard and had walked toward the window to investigate when she was shot.\n\nHer eight-year-old nephew had been playing a video game with Jefferson, a pharmaceutical worker, when she was gunned down.\n\n\u201cPerceiving a threat, the officer drew his duty weapon and fired one shot striking the person,\u201d the Fort Worth force said, releasing a blurry image of a gun found in the home that the mayor later described as \u201cirrelevant.\u201d\n\nDean, who had been with the department since 2017, did not identify himself as a police officer before opening fire, police said.\n\nIn the body-cam footage, he is heard saying in rapid speech that is difficult to understand: \u201cPut your hands up, show me your hands.\u201d\n\nThe words are followed immediately by the sound of gunfire.\n\n\u201cThere was no reason for her to be murdered. None,\u201d said a GoFundMe page organized to help the family with funeral expenses. \u201cWe must have justice.\u201d\n\nSeveral hundred mourners took part in a vigil Sunday in Fort Worth to honor Jefferson, local media reported. Some shed tears, while others cried out in anger.\n\nLocal pastor Michael Bell was quoted as urging people in Fort Worth to \u201ctake it to the streets.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not hugging them and giving them a Bible,\u201d he said.\n\nThe local Star-Telegram newspaper said Fort Worth police had shot at least seven people \u2014 six of them fatally \u2014 since June 1, although the department has not released figures for that period.\n\nMerritt described the city police as \u201cbasically one of the deadliest police departments in the United States.\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 A white policeman who shot dead a black Texas woman as she played video games at home with her young nephew has resigned and", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/14/6357df_police-bodycam-footage-shows-officer-opening-atatiana-jefferson-home-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
