(see below)\n\nUSD/ZAR Short Term Outlook 17 October 2019\n\nAnd then it was a case of wait and see...\n\nAnd see we did, with plenty of action: Brexit talks - it all fell flat once again despite Johnson's best efforts as the UK MPs shot his plan down...what now as 31 October deadline nears?\n\nEskom & Load shedding - the risk of load shedding is still high as we wait for clarity on Eskom's financials following ANOTHER bailout.\n\nSA Inflation - SARB continues to manage the situation well as the latest inflation figures from this week made for (mostly) good reading.\n\nDA capitulation - the leading opposition to the ANC seems to be in self-destruction mode.\n\nThe big news from over the weekend from the UK was that UK MPs had shot down the next plan from Boris Johnson, and the Brexit deadline was looming just 10 or so days on.\n\nAn extension on \u2018Brexit\u2019 was then requested from the EU but Boris was still adamant he could get it done by 31 October., but a couple of days later, he requested a pre-Christmas general election, with the terms being that if this was granted, then he would give MPs more time to debate his Brexit deal.\n\nAs for the extension request, the EU continued to delay a decision on how long this would be until the following Monday or Tuesday, leaving it perilously close to the October 31 deadline. France was not interested in a 3-month extension which was what Parliament was seeking, and was piling on the pressure to end this ongoing mess.\n\nAnd what a mess it has been...!\n\nThe Pound lost ground against majors during the course of the week, as well as the , as it turned around on the recent momentum on the .\n\nThis ever-changing story is so hard to keep up with, and who knows when it will come to a close...\n\nAt the same time, SA had its own fair share of politics going on with the DA in rather a shambles:\n\nIn just one week, there was the resignation of Herman Mashaba, Mmusi Maimane and Athol Trollip.\n\nThis followed Helen Zille's appointment as the Federal Council Chairperson - a return to the party that she really transformed herself all those years ago.\n\nBut with 3 of the most key figures in the DA gone, it remains to be seen if the main opposition party to the ANC can ever recover\n\nDespite all of this going on, the followed exactly as per our predictions from the Friday, breaking down lower into the sub R14.60 area:\n\nUSD/ZAR Chart\n\nAnd then in other news:\n\nLoad shedding seemed to be a bit more under control this last week, as Eskom\u2019s generator capacity has recovered. Despite this, expectation was for more load shedding through the summer with poor maintenance and old power plants plaguing the SOE. This last week saw the next Eskom bailout, this time for R59bn in order to keep the lights on across the country. One feels that Mboweni's Budget speech this week is going to be crucial to get clarity over the SOE's future and to convince Moody's that good things are coming if they have a little more patience...\n\nForeign purchases of local bonds ramped up a level this last week, with in excess of R6 billion being bought in just 4 days. Investors continue to be risk-on despite the shaky global climate, and for now, SA is the beneficiary of that. In other news, SA September inflation figures fell to 4.1%, down from 4.3% in August, which (while low) is in line with the SARB\u2019s expectation, and with that also came good news of expected petrol price reduction - following lower oil prices and the stronger .\n\nAfter 8 years at the helm of the ECB, Mario Draghi held his last meeting as President of the Central Bank. Draghi\u2019s term will be remembered for QE, low inflation rates and most notably dealing with the sovereign debt crisis in Greece. In the final meeting, he announced that interest rates would remain the same.\n\nAnd some final news which was certainly not the best of the week: SA government's cumulative irregular spend is now higher than its budget for police and defence, at a whopping R175bn...unbelievable!\n\nAs for the , there was some retracement back up toward the R14.70 mark...before Friday saw more Rand strength against the Dollar breaking to below R14.60, as well as against the Euro and Pound, breaking lower against all 3 to end the week on a high note!\n\nAnd that was the wrap!\n\nThe Week Ahead (28 Oct - 1 Nov 2019)\n\nAs we head into the last week of October, this is unlikely to be dumb squib at all.\n\nIn fact, expect just the opposite, with some major economic events to look out for as triggers during the week (Brexit deadline, Fed interest rate decision, SA Trade balances), culminating in two potentially HUGE triggers on Friday:\n\nUS\n\nMoody\u2019s Credit Rating Decision\n\nSo, fasten your seat-belts, this could be a rollercoaster ride of note!\n\nAs for the , the question is - can it extend its gains of the past few weeks?\n\nOur Elliott Wave analysis suggests it is starting to run out of steam short-term, but we are looking at some key levels to confirm the direction in the coming weeks.\n\nLook forward to hearing from you.\n\nTo your success~\n\nJames Paynter\n\nOriginal post", "description": "Forex Analysis by Dynamic Outcomes Rand Forecasting Service (James Paynter) covering: USD/ZAR, GBP/ZAR.
