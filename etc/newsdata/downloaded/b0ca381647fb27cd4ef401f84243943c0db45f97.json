She was 56.\n\nWhang\u2019s partner Jeff Vezain, known for playing in actor Gary Sinise\u2019s Lt. Dan Band, shared the sad news: \u201cA lifetime of love, adventure, humor and bliss now lives in our memories. On Tuesday evening (September 17th) around 7:20pm, Suzanne breathed her last breath here at home, as I knelt beside her and caressed her. For thirteen years she confronted cancer with courage, humor, determination and optimism.\u201d\n\nView photos Actress and comedian Suzanne Whang, pictured here on Feb. 17, 2018, has died at 56.

She was also an actress, whose mostly TV credits date back to the early \u201890s. She worked on shows from the gritty NYPD Blue to sitcom Two and a Half Men and General Hospital, the long-running, daytime soap opera.\n\nWhang was born in Virginia to Korean parents and studied at Yale University and Brown University. She was studying for her doctorate in cognitive psychology when she decided to become an actress and comedian instead after working as an extra on Spenser: For Hire.\n\nIn the comedy world, Whang often used her stand-up routines to talk about her heritage, and she notably embraced Asian stereotypes with her character Sung Hee Park.\n\nView photos Suzanne Whang performs her stand-up at the LaFemme Film Festival at Wilshire Theatre in Beverly Hills, Calif.

I'm just making fun of it. It's a satire in the same way that Carroll O'Connor who played Archie Bunker on All in the Family played this bigoted character that was also multi-dimensional and endearing,\u201d Whang said. \u201cPeople would be horrified by what he said but they\u2019d laugh and they also cared about him. It made people laugh and it made them think.\u201d\n\nAfter such a diverse career, Whang\u2019s circle of friends included many from the entertainment industry. Vanessa Marcil, her co-star on both Las Vegas and General Hospital, chose Whang to be the godmother to Kassius, the now-teenage son she shares with BH90210 actor Brian Austin Green. In June, Marcil was on the planning committee for a fundraiser to support Whang.\n\nMarcil paid tribute to her close friend on social media in the wake of her death.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
