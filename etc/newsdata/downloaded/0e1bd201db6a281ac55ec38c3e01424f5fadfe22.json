Now she\u2019s trying to build her profile and ability to go to more schools and counsel more children, so we talk about those sorts of things. Usually she\u2019s got the answer \u2013 I just ask questions. I think the art of good coaching is more about helping a person think something through, because at the end of the day they have to own the solution.\n\nThere has been a bit of reverse mentoring. Mental health in children is such a big issue, and when you hear Vicki talk about it, you can\u2019t help but be quite moved by the challenge.\n\nVicki Condon was motivated to set up Raise after the teenage son of a family friend took his own life. Wolter Peeters\n\nI\u2019ve also been really inspired. She\u2019s set up this office, she\u2019s hired hundreds of people who are on contracts, she started it all herself. I have watched her in the way that she has resolutely continued to take her message to politicians, to schools, and her tenacity and commitment are second to none. I think that\u2019s probably been the biggest learning for me.\n\nKilfinan does a review every year about how the mentoring relationship is going, just to make sure both sides see it as valuable. At the two-year mark, there\u2019s usually a decision about whether we continue or not. Vicki and I have decided to keep going.\n\nVicki Condon\n\nMy background was in corporate human resource management and when I had my children, I decided I didn\u2019t want to work corporate hours any more. So I retrained as a counsellor and found a couple of mentoring organisations that I volunteered with.\n\nI could see things that I might do a little bit differently. So I started writing a business plan and thought, \u201cIf I were to run my own youth mentoring organisation, this is how it would look.\u201d\n\nThen I put the plan away in my bottom drawer because I thought we have so many charities in Australia, we don\u2019t need another not-for-profit. And what do I know about running a charity?\n\nA few months later, our family experienced the death by suicide of a family friend\u2019s 14-year-old son. The day after his funeral I pulled out the business plan because I thought if I could help one young person like him, it would be worth having a go. That was November 2008. The organisation was just me in my bedroom office for the first three years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe attract volunteers from the community who are trained by qualified counsellors. We\u2019ve trained 4500 volunteer mentors, and worked with 5500 young people.\n\nI received an email from Kilfinan about applying for a mentor and I thought it was an amazing idea.\n\nThe application process was quite long, but it helped me to really get clear in my mind what I could get from having a mentor.\n\nRaise was working on this big strategic plan to offer our program to every public secondary school in the country. That\u2019s 1036 schools, meaning we\u2019d grow from 100 schools to more than 1000. That means 15,000 mentors.\n\nI knew I needed help and I was really keen to get some neutral advice with the growth strategy, some support around how to manage our board, and some leadership development.\n\nOne of David's greatest gifts is asking, \u201cAre you OK? How are you going?\u201d \u2014 Vicki Condon, CEO of Raise Foundation\n\nIt was a bit daunting in the beginning because I thought I didn\u2019t deserve this kind of help, but David just treats me as an equal.\n\nI meet him four or five times a year. We\u2019re quite casual. I email and say, \u201cOK, when can we get together?\u201d He\u2019s always very gracious in terms of fitting me into his diary \u2013 he\u2019s obviously very busy. He\u2019s the ultimate teacher \u2013 just by sitting alongside him, I learn so much.\n\nDavid has helped me to identify what kind of leader I want to be. I want to be democratic in terms of involving everybody, but I have learnt that I need to develop some courage in my leadership, because I\u2019ve always been the doer. Now I need to let everyone else use their skills and I need to stand back. So he\u2019s helped me to see that I can trust in the team.\n\nThe one thing I hate about my job is doing the media and having to present. But David says, \u201cVicki, they\u2019re just people like all of us.\u201d I had to pitch to the education minister in Canberra, and David said: \u201cHe\u2019s just a person, he believes in education. You\u2019ve got a good program.\u201d\n\nHe just instils a quiet confidence. One of his greatest gifts is asking, \u201cAre you OK? How are you going?\u201d As CEO, I am forever spending time with the team, partners, the mentees and volunteer mentors. And I\u2019m always asking, \u201cHow are you going?\u201d David is the only one who ever asks me how I\u2019m going.\n\nA lot of not-for-profit organisations are born out of compassion or wanting to do something for the community, but they don\u2019t really have the corporate expertise to run effectively. Kilfinan means we can learn skills for free from extraordinary business leaders, which means we can have much more impact.", "description": "Former Telstra chief David Thodey has been inspired by his work with Vicki Condon, CEO of student welfare not-for-profit Raise Foundation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3481%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_187%2C$y_438/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/93b847c497e2faf7ebf38e8857e838b27e32f6f1", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
