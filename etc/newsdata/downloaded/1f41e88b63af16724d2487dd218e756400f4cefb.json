Unlike Sony, which tends to stick to strictly utilitarian names for its consoles \u2014 PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, with a few self-explanatory \u201cSlim\u201d or \u201cPro\u201d variants thrown in \u2014 Microsoft has tended toward what we\u2019ll call... creative branding.\n\nThere\u2019s no obvious pattern here\n\nThere\u2019s no obvious pattern. There was the original Xbox, which is a good place to start. But that was followed by the Xbox 360, which had two midcycle refreshes, the Xbox 360 S (allegedly for \u201cslim\u201d) and the Xbox 360 E (for... something that starts with an \u201ce\u201d).
