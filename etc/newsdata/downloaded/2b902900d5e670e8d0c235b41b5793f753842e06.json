The players are subjected to a whirlwind tour of 12 to 13 days where there is nothing at stake. And then we complain that the number of injuries increases.'\n\nZapata scored Atalanta's only goal in the Champions League so far with the opener against Shakhtar at the San Siro, only for the visitors to come from behind to hand the Italians a second defeat following their 4-0 loss at Dinamo Zagreb.\n\n'We hope that this mess caused by the national teams is ended,' urged Gasperini, questioning the need for international breaks in September, October and November.\n\nGasperini's side arrive in Manchester in search of their first Champions League Group C point\n\nManchester City and Gabriel Jesus are top of the group after winning their opening two games\n\nZapata (top row, second from right) has scored Atalanta's solitary goal in the tournament so far\n\n'The championship cannot be stopped three times in three months. At this point, it is better to concentrate the challenges of the national teams into a single break.\n\n'Some matches are not watched by anyone - they are useless from both a technical-tactical point of view and an entertainment point of view.'\n\nThe only team making their group stage debut this season face an arduous task at City, who won 3-0 at Shakhtar and 2-0 at home to Dinamo to take their goals tally to 19 in their last six Champions League matches.\n\nAtalanta played two friendlies in England this summer, beating Norwich 4-1 and losing 2-1 to Leicester.\n\nZapata failed to score in either game, entering in the second half at Carrow Road and being replaced at half-time at the King Power Stadium.", "description": "The Atalanta coach was furious after top scorer Duvan Zapata was ruled out of Atalanta's arduous Champions League trip to Manchester City with an abductor strain sustained with Colombia.", "authors": ["Brian Homewood", "Ben Miller For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/17/19893590-0-image-a-26_1571416098939.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
