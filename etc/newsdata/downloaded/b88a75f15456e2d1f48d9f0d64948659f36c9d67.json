But France retained possesion from the re-start kick, allowing them to hold on to victory.\n\nTonga famously upset France in the pool stage at the 2011 World Cup but there was to be no repeat at Kumamoto Stadium with fly-half Romain Ntamack\u2019s assured place-kicking seeing the three-times finalists home despite a fierce battle. While France had laboured to a 33-9 win over USA in their last start on Wednesday, they were switched on from the first whistle. Here, they soared to a 10-0 lead after six minutes, with Alivereti Raka bursting away from a botched Tongan lineout before off-loading to centre Virimi Vakatawa for France\u2019s first try.\n\nQuick guide Italy duo receive three-match bans for lifting tackles Show Hide Prop Andrea Lovotti and replacement Nicola Quaglio will miss Italy's final Rugby World Cup Pool B game against New Zealand, as well as any potential quarter-final and semi-final, after both receiving three-match bans for lifting tackles, a judicial committee said on Sunday.\n\n\n\nLovotti was sent off for dropping Duane Vermeulen on his head in the 43rd minute of Friday's game against the Springboks while Quaglio was cited for his involvement in the same tackle as Italy went on to lose 49-3.\n\n\n\n\"If Italy does not progress, the balance of the suspensions will be served in the players' upcoming Pro14 matches,\" the committee said.

Snatching the ball out of a ruck and leaping for the line, scrumhalf Sonatane Takulua was rewarded with a try after a lengthy TMO review to give Tonga a huge boost.\n\nThe match turned on its head shortly after the break, with a thrilling try to France flanker Charles Ollivon ruled out by the TMO due to a forward pass.\n\nBuoyed by that decision, Tonga won a turnover with a bone-jarring tackle in midfield and winger Cooper Vuna hoofed the balldown field. The bounce popped up obligingly into the arms of gleeful centre Malietoa Hingano who barged over the line.\n\nBut with the ghosts of 2011 stirring, France redoubled their intensity at the breakdown and the pressure told as Tonga\u2019s discipline began to wane. Ntamack knocked over a pair of penalties to give his team breathing space and the match appeared settled when winger Damien Penaud cantered over in the 68th minute. But again, the try was cancelled to leave French fans howling, with a knock-on by fullback Maxime Medard spotted by the TMO.\n\nFlanker Kapeli scored Tonga\u2019s third try in the last minute but France hung on for a narrow win and now head north to Yokohama for next Saturday\u2019s clash with England to decide which nation tops the pool.\n\nThe thrilling victory sent Tonga out of the tournament with three successive defeats, while also confirming World Cup exits for Pool C rivals Argentina and the USA.", "description": "France squeezed past Tonga to qualify for the Rugby World Cup knockout stages and will face England next weekend to determine the winner of Pool C", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b06b2470d99659546f7b5f165c6192a240e99fa/0_40_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=adde38a9d12bc0ee81b199b70754d60f", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
