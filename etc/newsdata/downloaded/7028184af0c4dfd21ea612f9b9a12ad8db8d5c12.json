Lawmaker Pressed for Ambassador\u2019s Ouster, Diplomat Will Say", "language": "en", "text": "\u00a9 Joshua Roberts/Reuters Robert Livingston, the former Republican congressman, was once a household name in Washington.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Robert Livingston, the former Republican congressman turned lobbyist, repeatedly told a foreign service officer assigned to the White House that the American ambassador to Ukraine should be fired because of her association with Democrats, the officer plans to tell impeachment investigators on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nThe officer, Catherine M. Croft, will testify that she \u201cdocumented\u201d multiple calls from Mr. Livingston about the ambassador, Marie L. Yovanovitch, while she was working at the National Security Council from mid-2017 to mid-2018. She plans to say she informed two other officials \u2014 Fiona Hill, then the senior director for Europe and Russia at the council, and George P. Kent, a Ukraine expert at the State Department \u2014 about them at the time.\n\nSign up for the Morning Briefing Newsletter\n\n\u201cHe characterized Ambassador Yovanovitch as an \u2018Obama holdover\u2019 and associated with George Soros,\u201d she will say, referring to the billionaire liberal philanthropist, according to a copy of Ms. Croft\u2019s opening statement reviewed by The New York Times. \u201cIt was not clear to me at the time \u2014 or now \u2014 at whose direction or at whose expense Mr. Livingston was seeking the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch.\u201d\n\nThe testimony shifts forward by several months a timeline of known attacks on Ms. Yovanovitch by conservatives questioning, without evidence, her loyalty to President Trump. It is not clear if Mr. Livingston\u2019s work, or those financing it, were in any way connected to efforts by two Americans with business interests in Ukraine who wanted her gone and, later, by Mr. Trump\u2019s private lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Nor did Ms. Croft have anything to say about who else Mr. Livingston spoke with.\n\n\u00a9 Anna Moneymaker/The New York Times Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, was recalled from her posting in Kiev in spring, months ahead of schedule.\n\nStill, the outreach is certain to interest impeachment investigators, who are scrutinizing smears against Ms. Yovanovitch to understand if they were part of a larger pressure campaign by Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani to secure from Ukraine politically beneficial investigations into Democratic rivals. Mr. Trump eventually recalled her this spring from Kiev, months ahead of schedule.\n\nMs. Croft is one of two witnesses the House committees leading the inquiry will summon on Wednesday. Both served as advisers to Kurt D. Volker, the United States\u2019 special envoy to Ukraine, and in other diplomatic capacities related to that country. The other is Christopher J. Anderson, who preceded Ms. Croft as Mr. Volker\u2019s adviser.\n\nInvestigators will be keen to press both officers to confirm aspects of testimony given earlier by Mr. Volker and fill in details about his work trying to manage the demands of Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani on the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. They are expected to testify despite State Department orders not to.\n\nMr. Volker told investigators that he had not been aware of any quid pro quo demanded by Mr. Trump, but he detailed how Mr. Giuliani pressed the Ukrainians to publicly pledge that they would undergo investigations that could damage the president\u2019s political domestic adversaries. And text messages he shared with Congress at least appeared to show that a coveted White House meeting for Mr. Zelensky would come only if they agreed to certain investigations.\n\nAccording to a copy of his own opening statement, Mr. Anderson will testify that he and Mr. Volker worked to accommodate Mr. Giuliani\u2019s influence as they tried to help Ukraine\u2019s new government root out corruption in general and deepen its ties to the United States \u2014 but bumped up against it again and again.\n\nMr. Anderson plans to describe a June 13 meeting at the White House with Mr. Volker and John R. Bolton, then Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, in which Mr. Bolton indicated that Mr. Giuliani could pose a problem as they sought to build more support for Mr. Zelensky among senior White House officials.\n\n\u201cHe cautioned that Mr. Giuliani was a key voice with the President on Ukraine which could be an obstacle to increased White House engagement,\u201d Mr. Anderson planned to say. He will add that he wrote a summary of Mr. Bolton\u2019s remarks about Mr. Giuliani and shared it with Mr. Kent and others at the State Department.\n\nOther witnesses have testified that Mr. Bolton expressed alarm at Mr. Giuliani\u2019s role in even more vivid terms on other occasions.\n\nDuring another meeting of senior officials at the Energy Department a few days later, Mr. Anderson plans to testify, there were \u201cvague discussions in the meeting about how to address Mr. Giuliani\u2019s continued calls for a corruption investigation.\u201d\n\nMs. Croft, who took over as Mr. Volker\u2019s adviser in July, appears to have less to say about Mr. Giuliani.\n\nAs for Mr. Livingston, Ms. Croft does not precisely date the outreach in her opening statement, but she was assigned to the National Security Council as Ukraine director from July 2017 to July 2018, when she left for another government posting.\n\nIn her own testimony before impeachment investigators, Ms. Yovanovitch said that she was informed upon removal that Mr. Trump had lost faith in her and had been seeking her ouster since summer 2018. Ms. Yovanovitch, a career diplomat and veteran ambassador, said that she had no bias against Mr. Trump and that her bosses at the State Department had acknowledged she did \u201cnothing wrong.\u201d\n\nMr. Livingston was once a household name in Washington, and closely associated with the impeachment of another president, Bill Clinton. In 1998, Mr. Livingston was on the cusp of being elected House speaker as Republicans were preparing to impeach Mr. Clinton, but he abruptly resigned after details of his extramarital affair became public.\n\nForeign Agents Registration Act filings show that Mr. Livingston\u2019s firm, the Livingston Group, has represented Ukrainian clients in the past, including in 2018.\n\nMs. Croft may also have other information of interest to investigators, including about Mr. Trump\u2019s dealings with Mr. Zelensky\u2019s predecessor. She plans to say that during her time at the National Security Council, she staffed a September 2017 meeting between Mr. Trump and President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine and was involved that winter in Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to sell Javelin missiles to Ukraine.\n\nAs part of their work, House Democrats are investigating whether Mr. Trump later tried to use $391 million in military aid as leverage to secure the investigations he wanted into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and an unproven theory about Democrats colluding with Ukraine in the 2016 election. Ms. Croft will say she learned that Mr. Trump had frozen the aid in July.\n\nBoth Ms. Croft and Mr. Anderson intend to warn about the risks of a failure by the White House to support Mr. Zelensky and Ukraine in their continuing military conflict with Russia.\n\n\u201cHis best chance at success is with our support along with our European partners,\u201d Ms. Croft will say. \u201cIt is my hope that even as this committee\u2019s process plays out, we do not lose sight of what is happening in Ukraine and its great promise as a prosperous and democratic member of the European community.\u201d\n\nIn one case, Mr. Anderson plans to say, the senior White House officials blocked the release of a statement prepared by the State Department that would have condemned Russia for attacking and seizing Ukrainian military vessels in November 2018. Mr. Volker ended up sending his own tweet.\n\nMark J. MacDougall, a lawyer for both witnesses, planned to tell investigators for the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight and Reform Committees that neither Ms. Croft nor Mr. Anderson is the anonymous whistle-blower whose complaint about Mr. Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine helped prompt the impeachment inquiry. But in a statement of his own, he will say that neither witness would be willing to answer questions they believe may be meant to identify the whistle-blower.\n\n\u201cTo the extent we reasonably conclude that any questions directed to Mr. Anderson this afternoon are intended to assist anyone in establishing the identity of the whistle-blower, we will make the necessary objections and will give the witness appropriate instructions,\u201d Mr. MacDougall planned to say.\n\nHis decision to offer such introductory remarks was unusual, and reflected the extent to which accounts of Republican questioning related to the activity of the whistle-blower has spooked potential witnesses.\n\nSharon LaFraniere contributed reporting.", "description": "Former G.O.P.
