It is now updated to the notion of a \u201cPowell put\u201d, in an allusion to the function of an actual put option giving the holder the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a set price, serving as an insurance policy against a market decline.\n\nThe market expects central banks to remain on an loosening policy path.\n\nRead: A \u2018Powell put for the stock market? Don\u2019t even think about it\n\nDespite occasional spikes, implied volatility has been relatively contained on average this year, the IMF said.\n\nThe belief in a central bank rescue is allowing investors to ignore tensions over international trade policy and uncertainty about the global economic outlook, according to the IMF.\n\nSince April, U.S. equity prices have increased despite the fact that fundamentals-based valuations have dropped given higher uncertainty about future earnings, the report said.\n\nThe S&P 500 index SPX, -0.20% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.08% are flirting with record high levels. Stocks were generally weaker on Wednesday on a drop in retail sales.\n\nA separate report released by the international agency on Tuesday portrayed the global economy as getting perilously close to recession territory.\n\nRead: IMF says global economy to grow at slowest pace since 2008 financial crisis\n\nFinancial markets seem to think that central bank policy has reached a turning point, and that all efforts over the past few years to move interest rates are now over.\n\nThis shift \u201csuggests that a sustained normalization of rates and central bank balance sheets may be more difficult than previously envisioned,\u201d the report said.\n\nCentral banks also face a communication challenge \u201cwhen easing monetary policy to support an economic expansion in an environment of increased downside risks.\u201d\n\nThe IMF report also said spreads on high-yield bonds are too compressed relative to fundamentals, along with investment-grade bonds in the euro area and the U.S.\n\nThe yield on U.S. 10-year Treasury notes TMUBMUSD10Y, -1.67% slipped to 1.737% Wednesday, well below the 52-week high of 3.232% hit last November.\n\nEmerging market bonds appear to be overvalued for more than one-third of issuers included in the JP Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Global as of the third quarter, the report said.", "description": "The equity market in the United States is overvalued, according to an International Monetary Fund report released Wednesday.", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HD230_nyse_o_ZG_20190204072818.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
