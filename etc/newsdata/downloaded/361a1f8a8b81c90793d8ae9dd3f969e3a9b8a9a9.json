Here's why she handled Trump so well\u2014and why most men in the 2020 field probably won't.\n\nPhilippe Reines is a former deputy assistant secretary of state & senior adviser to Hillary Clinton, co-host of the \u201cUNREDACTED\u201d podcast, and a visiting lecturer at Tufts University\u2019s Tisch College.\n\nAs Hillary Clinton\u2019s sparring partner in her 2016 general election debate prep, I was part of the team that helped get her ready for both the predictable and the unthinkable. And despite what happened on Election Night, to most of America there was no question she won those debates.\n\nSo when a Democrat says the party needs someone who can out-Donald Donald in 2020, I stop listening. We already have a Donald. And to give credit where credit is due, he nails the part. Beating Trump does not require becoming Trump. If it did, we could go ahead and swear Alec Baldwin in as the 46th president of the United States.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nInstead, Democrats need someone whose natural self matches up well against Trump\u2019s preternatural self. Someone who can calmly respond to him but\u2014and here\u2019s the hard part\u2014does not respond to his attacks with a faux-macho mirror image. It\u2019s that second response that Trump is so good at triggering in his opponents, especially the male ones. And responding to Trumpian chest-beating with wannabe-Trumpian chest-beating doesn\u2019t work.\n\nWhich is exactly why I think, contrary to some Democratic voters\u2019 worries, a woman nominee might be our best bet in 2020. Tonight\u2019s debate could be further proof.\n\nThe men of this field\u2014and men in general\u2014are easier to rile up and are more likely to meet antagonization with aggression. When former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Cory Booker both expressed in passing wanting to beat Trump up in recent months, that was an understandable impulse\u2014but one that\u2019s likely to look phony and awkward in a match-up with Trump.\n\nTrump relishes going after male insecurities in particular. Low-energy. Little. And he\u2019s effective at it. \u201cOK, Jeb wants to be a tough guy,\u201d he said during one spat over eminent domain with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in a debate in early 2016. Bush appeared clearly unsettled, quick to attack back in kind rather than respond as Jeb. In doing so Bush doubly lost. Trump had synthesized a genuine vulnerability in how Jeb was perceived. And Jeb's flustered response was equally damaging.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio took it one step further. After one debate, Rubio had had enough. \u201cI have never seen a human being sweat like this man sweats,\u201d Trump said about Rubio at one point during a primary debate. Rubio\u2019s response? Nothing more than an open-mic imitation of Trumpian insults aimed at Donald. \u201cHe was having a meltdown,\u201d he said about Trump at a rally in February 2016. \u201cFirst he had this little makeup thing, applying, like, makeup around his mustache because he had one of those sweat mustaches,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cHe\u2019s like 6\u20192,\" Rubio said later, \u201cwhich is why I don\u2019t understand why his hands are the size of someone who is 5\u20192.\u201d How did that go? We know what happened to \u201cLittle Marco.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Trump is successful at getting the reaction he wants\u2014especially out of men.\n\nTrump tried it with Hillary in 2016 but failed. When he hovered over her during the second debate when she was speaking, a heavily memed moment on social media, Hillary continued along, not letting it knock her off her stride. Many\u2014including Hillary herself\u2014have wondered what would have happened had she swung around and told him to back off. I tried getting that reaction out of Hillary, too. As people present can attest, I subjected her to plenty of vicious, obnoxious, rude, boorish, juvenile and undignified behavior. Randomly interjecting the fact she failed the bar exam. Tapping on and complaining about the microphone (believe it or not, before he actually did so after the first debate). Asking if she needed a nap or to cut the debate short. Pulling blank pieces of paper out of my jacket to point to as proof of whatever I was lying about. Acknowledging the people in the audience nodding in agreement with me\u2014despite there not being an audience. (One person said I was chosen for the role because I had been auditioning for it my whole life but just didn\u2019t know it.) Hillary was successful because she didn\u2019t take the bait\u2014and also because she didn\u2019t let Trump force her to be someone she wasn\u2019t.\n\nThe biggest problem with Booker and Biden\u2019s approach is that the macho over-compensating is simply not who they really are.\n\nBooker is known for fighting political mudslinging with declarations of love. In his memoir, Booker described a (sort of) standoff with his political rival when he was on the Newark city council, Mayor Sharpe James. Booker wrote, \u201csome people probably expected me to take a jab at the mayor or to slight him in some way.\u201d But after more than a week of fasting, \u201cI felt light; I felt no negative emotions whatsoever.\u201d Same goes for Biden. While Biden pulls it off better, when criticized for Trump-esque tough talk, he has been pressured into apologizing. If you\u2019re going to mimic Trump, go full Trump and never regret. But don\u2019t swing between being a fighter and being a lover.\n\nWhen confronted with Trump\u2019s attacks, my worry is a male opponent might prove that boys will in fact be boys. But women are less susceptible to this particular variety of bullying. Maybe that\u2019s because it\u2019s harder to go after a woman in the same way, as Hillary Clinton\u2019s Senate debates in 2000 with then-Republican Rep. Rick Lazio showed, when his invasion of her personal space didn\u2019t go over well with people watching. Or maybe it\u2019s because so many of Trump\u2019s attacks appear aimed at his rivals\u2019 masculinity\u2014but women, of course, are safe on that front.\n\nRegardless, women appear better at weathering Hurricane Trump than men. Case in point: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Over the last two years she has proven to have Trump\u2019s number better than anyone. She is proof girls won\u2019t be boys. At a meeting with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence in the Oval Office about the shutdown in December, she spoke quietly and calmly, but she was tough, too. As she was speaking, she branded it the \u201cTrump shutdown.\u201d Trump looked up quickly. \u201cThe what?\u201d Clearly incensed, he said he would be \u201cproud to shut down the government.\u201d Right then, Pelosi won the shutdown battle before it even began.\n\nBut imagine for a moment the town hall format where Trump and a male opponent are free to roam the stage and get in each other\u2019s faces.Sound crazy? It\u2019s not. In one of their 2000 debates, Al Gore wandered a little too close to George W. Bush\u2019s comfort zone. Bush made his point with a subtle but clear facial expression. (By the way, Bush\u2019s debate prep team had anticipated and practiced for the scenario.) Bush won the moment. It\u2019s impossible to imagine actual fisticuffs ensuing during a 2020 general election debate. But it\u2019s very possible to imagine a moment where neither man looks good. And when neither man looks good, the one from whom more is expected is the loser. No matter who the Democratic nominee is, Trump won\u2019t be the one heading into a debate with the higher expectations.\n\nSo herein lies the challenge, and the opportunity to see how candidates handle necessary course corrections. Who can stand up to Trump\u2019s lying and impulsiveness without overcompensating, without swinging too far the other way?\n\nI believe any one of the woman candidates is better-equipped to face Trump in a debate because they will not swing as wildly as men are likely to do. There\u2019s obviously a larger conversation about sexism and misogyny impacting a female candidate while males face no such headwind\u2014but on a debate stage against Trump, women have the upper hand.\n\nSpecifically, Sen. Elizabeth Warren is under-appreciated as a potential Trump foe. She might have a narrower margin of victory relative to a hypothetical match-up with Trump compared to the other candidates, but dating back to 2017, she has weathered the most sustained attacks from him. And she has done it by remaining focused on her own plans and sticking with her strategy. I\u2019d expect her to do the same when faced with those attacks on a debate stage\u2014which she\u2019s already thinking about. Last month, she said, \u201cYou don't back down from a bully. ... Nobody\u2019s getting behind me on a debate stage and doing a handsy thing. That's not happening.\u201d Hillary facing it last time allows a woman to confront it head on next time.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris seems more than ready to coolly, clinically expose Trump. Her pointed questioning of Brett Kavanaugh stood out during his confirmation hearings. In the first debate, she may have asked for more time to respond, but she did not need to shout when she upended Biden\u2019s defense of his busing record. And her performance was effective.\n\nThere are men, certainly, who also seem less likely to cave to Trump\u2019s baiting. Sen. Bernie Sanders for instance, has one gear, and that gear is, shall we say, emphatic. I don\u2019t think Trump can unleash a new side to Bernie\u2014which would be an advantage for the senator.\n\nAnd Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s quiet confidence is perfectly suited to expose Trump\u2019s loud insecurity.\n\nWill a woman\u2019s possible advantage debating Trump mean anything for the election? Going into 2016\u2019s first debate, Clinton and Trump were effectively tied. After the third debate three weeks later, Clinton opened her most commanding lead. And despite what happened on Election Night, nobody should write off the importance of debates in 2020.\n\nThose who worry a woman as nominee would face the same obstacles Hillary did are right to do so. But the unique strengths of a woman nominee (or a two-woman ticket) might be the solution to the unique problems posed by Trump.\n\nThe question to ask might not be, Can a woman beat Trump? The real question is, Can a man?", "description": "I was Hillary's sparring partner during debate prep.
