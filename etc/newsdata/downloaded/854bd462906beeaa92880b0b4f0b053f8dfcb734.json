President Trump responded by announcing a new round of tariff hikes and China promised retaliation.\n\nOn Thursday morning, it seemed talks might again be on the verge of a breakdown before they had even begun. The South China Morning Post reported deputy-level trade talks this week had made no progress and that Chinese Vice Premier Liu He would leave after the first day of what were scheduled to be two days of talks.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, however, appears to have rescued the talks by announcing that he would host Chinese Vice Premier Liu He at the White House on Friday.\n\nBig day of negotiations with China. They want to make a deal, but do I? I meet with the Vice Premier tomorrow at The White House. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2019\n\nThis afternoon lunch was delivered to the negotiators and the talks extended into the early evening.\n\nThere have been a number of reports in the media suggesting that the Trump administration may be open to a partial deal, perhaps around the idea of a currency pact. That could involve China agreeing to not allow its currency to fall below a specified range in exchange for the U.S. lifting the \u201ccurrency manipulator\u201d label and possibly easing back on existing tariffs or not implementing hikes scheduled for later this year.", "description": "\"We're going to meet with them tomorrow here,\" Trump said on the White House lawn. \"And it's going very, very well.\" | Economy", "authors": ["John Carney"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/pres-donald-trump-dc-9162019-south-lawn-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
