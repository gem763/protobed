Another way to shrink debt is to sell assets.\n\nAmong the companies gearing up to issue high-grade bonds is Danaher Corporation DHR, +0.29%, which Bank of America said was scouting out investor interest in Europe for a potential euro-denominated offering.\n\nDanaher is expected to raise funds for its $21 billion purchase of General Electric\u2019s GE, +1.73% biopharma business, a sale that also aims to help GE manage its massive debt load.\n\nMeanwhile, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts don\u2019t expect borrowers to slam on the brakes to borrowing just yet. They project $1.187 trillion of total high-grade bond issuance to flow by the end of 2019, only a 4% annual drop from last year\u2019s volume.", "description": "The busiest month of the year for U.S. high-grade bond issuance is often September, with Bank of America Merrill Lynch forecasting another $120 billion to...", "authors": ["Joy Wiltermuth", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ493_corp_b_ZG_20190830121232.jpg"}
