We\u2019re better than that chant against Trump.", "language": "en", "text": "That\u2019s why I cringed when I heard about chants of \u201cLock him up\u201d directed at President Trump on Sunday night at Nationals Park.\n\nBooing politicians isn\u2019t our most dignified political tradition, but particularly at a professional sports event, it\u2019s fairly typical (and sometimes deserved) treatment for elected officials and candidates from both parties.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut \u201cLock him up\u201d? We\u2019re better than that.\n\nI understand and often share the anger that many Americans feel toward the president. From his administration\u2019s inhumane treatment of children and families at our border to his abuses of power, the president has earned more than his fair share of criticism.\n\nBut in the United States, we don\u2019t simply lock up politicians we disagree with, and we shouldn\u2019t chant about wanting to either. If a president does commit a crime \u2014 particularly \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d \u2014 the Constitution provides us with a specific process to follow, which the House is now appropriately exploring with its impeachment inquiry.\n\nAD\n\nAs citizens, we can \u2014 and should \u2014 oppose the president\u2019s bad policies, words and behavior at every turn with all the passion we can muster. But in doing so, we shouldn\u2019t copy his style and his tactics, which are designed with one outcome in mind: division. I have been to other countries where that kind of rhetoric is standard, and the results aren\u2019t something we should emulate.\n\nAD\n\nAmericans who oppose the president\u2019s policies and actions \u2014 as I do \u2014 shouldn\u2019t compete in a race to the bottom with the president. We won\u2019t win it, and we just might lose ourselves along the way.\n\nMonday morning, I was asked on CNN what I thought of the \u201cLock him up\u201d chants, and I answered that I think the institution of the presidency deserves respect, even when the actions of our president, at times, don\u2019t. I also said I hope we won\u2019t hear \u201cLock him up\u201d chants at Democratic rallies or at our convention.\n\nAD\n\nOver the past day, I\u2019ve been criticized by some for those comments, and I understand why some people have disagreed with me. I understand that the tens of thousands of people at Sunday\u2019s game and tens of millions more around the country are filled with real, justified anger over what the president is doing to this country.\n\nAD\n\nI believe, though, that our better course is to remind the president what this country stands for. We know who Trump is; we need to show who we are.\n\nFor nearly 250 years, America has survived because of the strength of our ideals and our institutions, from our constitutionally guaranteed rights \u2014 including the right to free speech \u2014 to our system of elected, accountable governance and a free press, which are far greater than any one person. It\u2019s with that in mind that I urge everyone to remember \u2014 especially now \u2014 the difference between one president and the presidency. We\u2019re free to criticize the former but should be careful to protect the latter.\n\nAD\n\nEven as a member of the Senate, I struggle to find ways to stop the president from damaging the institutions that make our country great, and it\u2019s easy for any of us to respond to a sense of helplessness with anger.\n\nAD\n\nBut since Sunday night, I\u2019ve been thinking about Michelle Obama\u2019s advice to the country during the bitter 2016 presidential campaign: \u201cWhen they go low,\u201d she said, \u201cwe go high.\u201d\n\nAs the president goes lower, we have the opportunity to respond on the high road. Even at a baseball game, we should do our best to choose that path and recognize that, in our free, democratic country governed by the rule of law, we have regular opportunities to hold elected officials accountable \u2014 at the ballot box. After all, it was President Barack Obama who often reminded us of a more effective strategy: \u201cDon\u2019t boo \u2014 vote!\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "As Michelle Obama tells us: When they go low, we should go high.", "authors": ["Chris Coons"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/L_uZvsxUtX_b1-Tya_qJs7c3Who=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SBA3JIXZEQI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
