This week, he explores the best time to book your summer 2020 holiday.\n\nSchools are back, holiday tans are fading and adverts for summer sun 2020 are here. Tour companies, airlines and hotels are taking bookings now for next year\u2019s peak weeks in July and August. But does it pay to sign up so early?\n\nDo you want something specific?\n\nSmall group escorted tours should also be booked early. Tui says its eight-night Wonders Of The Galapagos Islands tour (from \u00a32,483pp next June) or 13-night Once In A Lifetime China tour (from \u00a32,326pp also in June) are very popular\n\nIf you want something that will be in limited supply, then the sooner you reserve it the better. That means places in boutique hotels, family rooms, kids-go-free spots, honeymoon suites or even premium seats on planes.\n\nSmall group escorted tours should also be booked early. Tui says its eight-night Wonders Of The Galapagos Islands tour (from \u00a32,483pp next June) or 13-night Once In A Lifetime China tour (from \u00a32,326pp also in June) are very popular.\n\nReserving early won\u2019t give you a cast-iron guarantee that you\u2019ll get what you want as firms can change things if hurricanes, terrorism or other events hit (you\u2019re then guaranteed \u2018equal\u2019 alternatives or full refunds). But reserve early and it means no one else can get the special facilities you\u2019ve paid for if the holiday goes ahead.\n\nFortunately, you don\u2019t need to pay too much to reserve trips. The full balance on a package isn\u2019t normally due until three months before departure, so that means May 2020 for August holidays. Thomas Cook has no-deposit deals and interest-free payment plans so that you can spread the cost of your trip over nine months.\n\nDo you want a rock-bottom price?\n\nTravel agents call it \u2018holiday roulette\u2019 \u2013 trying to work out if prices will rise or fall as we get closer to summer 2020. The bad news is that the odds are stacked against holidaymakers. Pay for a package, flight or hotel room now and, if the same deal is later offered for less, then you\u2019re not due a refund. But if prices rise, you can be asked for more.\n\nAs The Mail on Sunday revealed earlier this month, tour firms can add surcharges of up to eight per cent of a prepaid price up to 20 days before departure, to cover extra bills from fluctuating exchange rates or higher fuel costs. No mainstream company has levied the full charge this year, even amid the turbulence of Brexit (and Thomas Cook offers a Brexit guarantee saying it won\u2019t do so in the future) but the risk is there whenever you decide to book.\n\nEarly birds: Planning next year\u2019s trip could reap rewards, but be wary\n\nIs your money safe?\n\nProtect yourself by checking your holiday firm is legitimate. Don\u2019t rely on an ABTA or the Civil Aviation Authority\u2019s ATOL (Air Travel Organiser\u2019s Licence) stamp on a tour firm website as cowboys often put these on fake sites. Go to \u2018Member Search\u2019 at abta.com and \u2018Check an ATOL\u2019 at the Civil Aviation Authority site (caa.co.uk) to make sure your provider is listed.\n\nATOL membership is the most important, as it ensures you won\u2019t lose out if your tour firm collapses before or during a holiday.\n\nPut deposits on credit cards for extra protection and take out travel insurance now, even though you don\u2019t get on a plane for nearly a year. That means you can claim a refund if something like ill-health strikes and you need to cancel right up to the departure date.", "description": "Tour companies, airlines and hotels are taking bookings now for next year's peak weeks in July and August.
