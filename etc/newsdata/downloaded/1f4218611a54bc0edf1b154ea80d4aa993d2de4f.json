Mr Kebede in particular bears no blame for what occurred in his flat, much less for the catastrophic events that followed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018On the contrary, he did exactly what a responsible person might be expected to do in the circumstances and his presence of mind in switching off the electricity as he left the flat enabled important evidence to be gathered about the origin of the fire.\u2019\n\nGrenfell United, a group which represents some of the victims of the fire, welcomed the findings.\n\nA spokeswoman said: \u2018We are glad to read this report totally exonerates our neighbour in flat 16.\n\n\u2018The Whirlpool fridge started the fire and our neighbour did everything he could do try to stop it and raise the alarm.\n\n\u2018He is long overdue an apology from media and corporates that tried to scapegoat him.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
