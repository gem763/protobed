Gayle said, 'What\u2019s the number?' I said, 'I'm not going to tell you, because you\u2019ll drive me crazy and then I\u2019ll end up dead.'\"\n\nWhen Oprah turned 57 in 2011, she could finally breathe a sigh of relief and later questioned why she believed her vision, Metro reports.\n\n\"When I got to 57, it was like, 'Why did all my life I think it was going to be 56?'\n\n\"At the time I started having this vision of 56. It was when I was in Milwaukee and I was trapped in a world where I could see how dire it was,\" she said.\n\nThe now 66-year-old also said to talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres that she was recently extremely sick with pneumonia, Forbes reports.\n\n\"Pneumonia is nothing to play with, y\u2019all,\" the philanthropist told Ellen.\n\n\"It\u2019s serious. I was on antibiotics for a week and the antibiotics weren\u2019t working. And then I go back for another CT scan and they go, 'It\u2019s actually worse. You should see a lung specialist.'\"\n\n(Sources: People, Metro, Forbes)", "description": "The queen of talk thought she\u2019d die at the age of 56.", "authors": ["Robyn Lucas"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9459/e727ce9c5afe40419f32e8f13d37c2ef.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
