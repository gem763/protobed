REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo\n\nLeroy, who was to have begun work on Dec. 1, denies any wrongdoing.\n\nMonday\u2019s announcement throws KPN\u2019s CEO hunt to fill the vacancy left by Maximo Ibarra back into uncertainty. Ibarra announced his departure in June to lead Sky Italia, after just over a year in the job.\n\nIt also raises questions as to whether KPN properly vetted Leroy\u2019s candidacy before triumphantly announcing her appointment on Sept. 5.\n\nWithin days it emerged that she had sold 285,000 euros worth of shares in Proximus (PROX.BR), the company she was leaving, on Aug. 1, while confidential negotiations with KPN were ongoing. [nL5N26B1EV].\n\nIt was her first transaction in three years. When Leroy\u2019s departure was announced on Sept. 5, Proximus shares fell by 2.5%. [nL5N25W61L]\n\nBrussels police and prosecutors raided her home and office on Sept. 19 as part of an investigation into possible insider trading.\n\nLeroy, who has said in her defence in the past she was only able to sell shares during certain periods, stepped down as Proximus CEO Sept. 20, with Chief Financial Officer Sandrine Dufour becoming Proximus CEO on an interim basis.\n\nNO CHOICE\n\nKPN has named Chief Operational Officer Joost Farwerck as interim CEO.\n\nKPN, which had been enthusiastic about Leroy\u2019s appointment, citing her experience in management roles in Proximus and earlier at Unilever, said it had no choice but to cut ties, given the uncertainties.\n\n\u201cThe duration of the procedures which concern Mrs. Leroy by the authorities in Belgium is unclear and unpredictable,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe Supervisory Board of KPN considers these uncertainties around timing not in the interest of KPN and its stakeholders,\u201d it said.\u201d\n\nLeroy could not immediately be reached for comment. Proximus chairman Stefaan De Clerck was quoted in Belgian newspaper L\u2019Echo as saying that a return to Proximus by Leroy was \u201cnot on the agenda\u201d.\n\nKPN\u2019s supervisory board said the decision had been difficult due to Leroy\u2019s positive track record. \u201cWe wish her all the best,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nIt added that it expected to update markets on its CEO hunt \u201cat short notice\u201d.\n\nKPN has been struggling to recover from years of weak sales and profit growth. In July, it said its core earnings would grow \u201cslightly\u201d in 2019 for the first time in more than five years.", "description": "Dutch telecoms firm KPN ditched plans to name Belgian executive Dominique Leroy as its new CEO because she is under investigation for selling shares in her previous company, Proximus , while she was in talks to take the KPN job.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435468087&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T0HG", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
