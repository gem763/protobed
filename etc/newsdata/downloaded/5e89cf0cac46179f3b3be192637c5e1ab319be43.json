Additionally, lawmakers will hold interviews in coming days with people they deem key witnesses in their investigation, including Trump\u2019s former envoy for Ukraine, the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general and the ousted ambassador to Kiev.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not fooling around here,\u201d House Intelligence Chairman Adam B. Schiff said as he appeared with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) at a news conference on Capitol Hill. \u201cWe don\u2019t want this to drag on months and months and months.\u201d\n\nThe president, on Twitter, accused Pelosi of \u201cwasting everyone\u2019s time and energy on BULLSHIT.\u201d Later, during two televised appearances alongside the president of Finland, Trump laid into Schiff, calling him a \u00ad\u201clowlife\u201d and a \u201cshifty, dishonest guy\u201d as the Finnish leader looked on uncomfortably. He attacked Schiff for presenting an exaggerated version of the phone call during a hearing last week. Schiff defended his account as obvious parody.\n\nWhile the impeachment inquiry is centered on the president, his top aides are increasingly becoming swept up in the controversy. Earlier in the day, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed that he listened in on Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volo\u00addymyr Zelensky and reiterated his complaint from the day before that Democrats\u2019 demands for interviews with State Department officials amounted to an act of intimidation.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t tolerate folks on Capitol Hill bullying and intimidating State Department employees \u2014 that\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d Pompeo said during a news conference in Italy.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, questioned the extent of Pompeo\u2019s knowledge about the Zelensky call and warned him not to obstruct their efforts to speak with State Department officials.\n\nSchiff said he is \u201cdeeply concerned about Secretary Pompeo\u2019s effort now to potentially interfere with witnesses whose testimony is needed before our committee.\u201d The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Robert Menendez (N.J.), called on Pompeo to recuse himself from all Ukraine-related matters.\n\nTrump defended his secretary of state, noting his high marks at Harvard and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. \u201cAdam B. Schiff should only be so lucky to have the brains, honor and strength of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nSchiff \u201ccouldn\u2019t carry his blank strap,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office, omitting the word \u201cjock\u201d in an apparent effort to censor the schoolyard taunt.\n\nPompeo\u2019s recently departed special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, is scheduled to meet with congressional investigators behind closed doors on Thursday. It remains unclear whether a transcript of the interview will be made public.\n\nIn advance of the appearance, Volker has turned over a number of documents to congressional staffers consisting of text messages with Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani and other people, said a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record.\n\nGiuliani, who was a leading figure in pushing the Ukrainian government to investigate Biden and pushing for the removal earlier this year of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, has insisted he was on a mission for the State Department.\n\nAccording to a rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call, Zelensky expressed appreciation for U.S. help in defending Ukraine against Russia and said he wanted to buy more U.S. weapons. Trump froze hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine days before the call. He replied to Zelensky, \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though,\u201d and requested that he investigate allegations that Democrats conspired with Ukrainians to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Elsewhere in the call, Trump also pressed for an investigation into Biden and the former vice president\u2019s son.\n\nA whistleblower complaint, filed in August with the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general, alleges that Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, along with other U.S. officials\u2019 interactions with the Ukrainian government, reveal that Trump abused his office to pressure a foreign country to damage a political opponent in the 2020 election. The White House denies the accusation, saying Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine out of frustration over Europe\u2019s lack of monetary support for Ukraine and continued problems related to corruption in the country.\n\nWhen asked Wednesday whether he thought anything was improper on the phone call, Pompeo said that everything the Trump administration has done related to Ukraine has been \u00ad\u201cremarkably consistent\u201d and focused on confronting the \u201cthreat that Russia poses\u201d and rooting out \u201ccorruption\u201d in Ukraine.\n\nMany State Department employees feel that they are caught in the middle of a political battle between the agency and House committees, said a U.S. diplomat, speaking on the condition of anonymity to comment frankly about the adverse impact on morale.\n\nCareer Foreign Service officers are expected to follow the direction of State Department leadership and respond to congressional requests. It may not be possible to do both now.\n\n\u201cPeople are not politicized, and they\u2019re very anxious not to be,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cThey want to do their jobs, serve their country and not be pulled into this.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 quest for answers took a bizarre turn on Wednesday after State Department Inspector General Steve Linick provided lawmakers a packet of documents containing conspiracy theories and other unproven claims about Biden, his son and former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, whom Trump criticized in his phone call with Zelensky.\n\nThe packet was discovered in the State Department and featured what appeared to be amateurish calligraphy intended to indicate that it\u2019s a White House document, said people briefed on lawmakers\u2019 meeting with Linick.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s essentially a packet of propaganda and disinformation spreading conspiracy theories,\u201d Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.) told reporters afterward.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Giuliani told \u201cCNN Today\u201d that he was responsible for sending some of the materials in the packet to the State Department, saying he sent an \u201coutline\u201d of allegations against Biden and Yovanovitch.\n\nIn a statement, top House Democrats criticized the packet, saying these documents \u201creinforce concern that the president and his allies sought to use the machinery of the State Department to further the president\u2019s personal political interests.\u201d\n\nThe meeting with Linick had been anticipated as a potential avenue for independently gathering documents, but it proved a disappointment to some.\n\nRaskin called the packet a \u201ccompletely irrelevant distraction.\u201d\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s news conference with the Finnish president, Trump refused to say exactly what he wanted from the Ukrainian president regarding Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nTrump ignored the question posed by a reporter and focused his answer instead on why he held back military aid to Ukraine, citing, as he has in the past, corruption there and the claim that the United States is the \u201conly one who gives the big money to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nWhen the reporter pressed Trump to answer his question about the Bidens, Trump became angry and demanded that the reporter \u201cnot be rude\u201d and instead ask a question of the Finnish president. Trump eventually said that \u201cBiden and his son are stone-cold crooked,\u201d then leveled his oft-made attack against the \u201cfake news\u201d media.\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump continued his criticisms of the whistleblower and said his identity should become public.\n\n\u201cThis country has to find out who that person was because that person\u2019s a spy, in my opinion,\u201d Trump told reporters.\n\nThe whistleblower said his complaint was based on conversations with more than half a dozen U.S. officials.\n\nIn his remarks Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that there is value in protecting the identity of whistleblowers in some cases.\n\n\u201cI think a whistleblower should be protected if the whistleblower\u2019s legitimate,\u201d he said.\n\nRachael Bade, Karoun Demirjian, Karen DeYoung, Colby Itkowitz, Carol Morello and Felicia Sonmez contributed to this report.", "description": "As President Trump called the impeachment inquiry \u201cBULLSHIT,\u201d Democratic lawmakers promised to subpoena the White House by the end of the week if officials refuse to produce documents, and they will hold interviews in coming days with key witnesses.", "authors": ["John Hudson", "National Security Reporter Focusing On The State Department", "John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/06r6O4qv7y0pghsz66c7EeI638I=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BHGI75XFPAI6TNAD644ITGMC2I.jpg"}
