Like Pompeo, the many thousands of evangelical pilgrims were all Christian Zionists. But he arrived in the Israeli capital to deliver a reassuring message \u2014 and also a warning.\n\nEarlier that week, the U.S. announced its decision to abandon their wartime allies, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), to the tender mercies of Tukey\u2019s President Erdogan. The Kurds are \u201cno angels\u201d President Trump pronounced. This naturally left Israelis wondering if their alliance with the U.S. would depend on meeting this new angelic criterion.\n\nPompeo waved that away. \u201cIt would be a fundamental misreading of these last few weeks to suggest that there is any risk to our relationship,\u201d he told me when we met at the official residence of the U.S. ambassador in Jerusalem. \u201cOur relations with Israel are founded on pillars of culture, institutions, shared values and defense interests. That relationship is so strong that it could even withstand peace breaking out in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nI asked Pompeo if he, as a former military officer, felt discomfort over the U.S. government turning its back on its Kurdish comrades in arms. \u201cIt is fundamentally wrong to say the U.S. abandoned the Kurds,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe remain in close touch with the SDF and we will continue to work together to take down the threat of radical Islamic terrorism in Syria and western Iraq.\u201d\n\nNow that the Kurds have made an alliance with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, will the U.S. now need to coordinate policy with Damascus? Pompeo waves away the suggestion. \u201cWe won\u2019t seek the approval of Damascus. We\u2019re in constant contact with the SDF. Even in the last few minutes.\u201d\n\nPompeo rejects that idea that the withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria gives the Russians a permanent stronghold there. Russian forces have taken advantage of the vacuum left by Trump\u2019s withdrawal, a fact that has been much celebrated in the Russian media.\n\nNone of that seems to bother Pompeo. \u201cSyria is in desperate condition. Six million people have fled. The country is in ruins. It will need four to five hundred billion dollars, depending on how you count it, for basic reconstruction. There are many stories yet to be told,\u201d he says.\n\nI asked Pompeo about President Trump\u2019s contention that the U.S. stations troops in many countries where they are not needed. Wouldn\u2019t withdrawing these forces send a message of American weakness?\n\n\u201cNever mistake troop strength for security. Counting battalions is an unsophisticated way of measuring strength. If you build your economy and have military power that stands behind your diplomatic might, you can actually achieve outcomes in a way that deters and reduces the need for increased forces.\u201d\n\nSo far, the Trump administration has shown a decided preference for this sort of preventive warfare, using sanctions and tariffs all over the globe. Pompeo sees it as an effective weapon, especially in the case of Iran.\n\n\u201cIran\u2019s economy will shrink 10% to 15% in 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means the regime has fewer resources to build out its terror campaign, to improve its missile program or to invest in a new generation of military technology.\u201d He also insists that the people of Iran are increasingly aware of how corrupt and inept the regime is.\n\nUntil March, the U.S. ambassador\u2019s residence in Jerusalem had been the U.S. consulate. It served as the de facto American embassy to the Palestinian Authority. The change symbolizes this administration\u2019s unequivocal support for Israel.\n\nU.S. Ambassador David Friedman recently said that the much-awaited American peace proposal will not force people to leave their homes. Does that mean Israeli settlers would be able to stay?\n\n\u201cAmbassador Friedman\u2019s statement is certainly true,\u201d responds Pompeo. \u201cOur vision would deliver an outcome that Ambassador Friedman just described.\u201d Pompeo refused to be drawn on whether the result would be similar to former Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin's Autonomy Plan, which did not allow for an independent Palestinian state.\n\nWhen one of Pompeo\u2019s aides signaled that his time was up, I asked him if there was anything else he wanted to say. His answer surprised me.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo landed in Jerusalem on Friday morning, the city was full of evangelical pilgrims celebrating the Festival of Tabernacles.
