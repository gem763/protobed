It costs $6.99 a month, or $69.99 a year, though Disney is offering a discount that brings the cost down to about $4 a month if you sign up for three years before September 2.\n\nDisney is promising the ability to stream Disney movies and TV shows, Marvel and Pixar movies, shows from National Geographic, the entirety of \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d everything \u201cStar Wars,\u201d plus a bunch of original shows \u2013 like the revival of Disney Channel\u2019s \u201cLizzie McGuire\u201d starring Hilary Duff and the documentary series \u201cThe World According to Jeff Goldblum.\u201d\n\nRead more: How Disney Plus, HBO Max, and NBC\u2019s streaming service stack up in the battle against Netflix\n\nBut what is it actually going to be like to use Disney Plus? The Streamable, a website that provides daily news for cord-cutters and in-depth testing for streaming services and devices, attended Disney\u2019s D23 Expo earlier this month and filmed the company\u2019s walkthrough of Disney Plus on an Apple TV, posting the results to YouTube. (The Streamable has also written impressions and a full review of the service, based on its experience at D23. You should definitely check those out.)\n\nThanks to The Streamable and Disney, we have a good idea of what to expect when Disney Plus launches later this year. Take a look at what it should be like to actually use Disney Plus.\n\nHere\u2019s the kind of screen you\u2019ll see when you boot up Disney Plus for the first time.\n\nsource YouTube/The Streamable\n\nYou can scroll along the top to see featured items, including new movies like \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d and fan favorites like \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d\n\nsource YouTube/The Streamable\n\nCourtesy of The Streamable\n\nBelow the top carousel of images are the five major categories of Disney Plus: Disney, Pixar, Marvel, \u201cStar Wars,\u201d and National Geographic.\n\nsource YouTube/The Streamable\n\nEach of the categories have cute little animations when you hover over them. Pixar\u2019s shows clouds from \u201cToy Story\u201d flying by \u2026\n\nsource YouTube/The Streamable\n\nCourtesy of The Streamable\n\n\u2026 while Disney\u2019s icon animates to show fireworks above Cinderella\u2019s castle.\n\nsource YouTube/The Streamable\n\nWhen you click into any one of these categories, you\u2019ll see a brief animation \u2026\n\nsource YouTube/The Streamable\n\nCourtesy of The Streamable\n\n\u2026 before all the content appears below.\n\nsource YouTube/The Streamable\n\nWhen you hover over a piece of content, like Disney\u2019s \u201cFrozen,\u201d a brief trailer will automatically play at the top of the screen.\n\nsource YouTube/The Streamable\n\nCourtesy of The Streamable\n\nThanks to the demo, we got to see a handful of titles confirmed for Disney Plus, including old favorites like \u201cThe Parent Trap\u201d and \u201cSteamboat Willie\u201d as well as newer classics like \u201cMoana,\u201d \u201cRemember The Titans,\u201d and \u201cLilo and Stitch.\u201d\n\nsource YouTube/The Streamable\n\nSimilarly, we saw that Pixar would have almost every piece of content it\u2019s ever made available on Disney Plus, from features like \u201cInside Out\u201d to shorts like \u201cBao\u201d and original series like \u201cForky Asks A Question.\u201d\n\nsource YouTube/The Streamable\n\nCourtesy of The Streamable\n\nDisney has the full rights to \u201cStar Wars,\u201d so the company will feature every film in the main series, in order, right in the app. You can also watch any of the movie spin-offs or TV shows there, too.\n\nsource YouTube/The Streamable\n\nHere\u2019s what the National Geographic page looks like: It\u2019s full of documentaries and shows that depict life on planet Earth.\n\nsource YouTube/The Streamable\n\nCourtesy of The Streamable\n\nWe still don\u2019t know which Marvel movies will be included at launch, but it won\u2019t include all 23 titles from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Still, most movies, and all of the original shows, are expected to be there.\n\nsource YouTube/The Streamable\n\nHere\u2019s what it looks like when you actually click a title. Here, you have the ability to play or pick up where you left off or to add the title to your watch list by clicking that plus sign. You can also read the movie\u2019s description, watch extras, and see related movies at the bottom of the screen.\n\nsource YouTube/The Streamable\n\nCourtesy of The Streamable\n\nWhen you click \u201cplay\u201d on a movie, you\u2019ll see the Disney Plus logo in the upper right-hand corner for a few seconds before it disappears.\n\nsource YouTube/The Streamable\n\nSimilar to Netflix, you\u2019ll have a sidebar on the left where you can jump to different sections, like movies and originals.\n\nsource YouTube/The Streamable\n\nCourtesy of The Streamable\n\nHere\u2019s what the Watchlist looks like. Pretty simple!\n\nsource YouTube/The Streamable\n\nWhen you visit the Movies tab, you can filter by originals, alphabetical order, or genre. By default, Disney will show you featured films it wants you to see.\n\nsource YouTube/The Streamable\n\nCourtesy of The Streamable\n\nIf you click the Series tab, you\u2019ll see similar filters to choose which TV show you want to watch.\n\nsource YouTube/The Streamable\n\nIt doesn\u2019t look as if you\u2019ll get any filters when you visit the Disney Plus Originals tab, however, which just shows you a big grid of content to choose from.\n\nsource YouTube/The Streamable\n\nCourtesy of The Streamable\n\nThe bottom-left part of the sidebar features settings, but the top-left portion features your user profile.\n\nsource YouTube/The Streamable\n\nYou just type your name and pick from a wide variety of icons from Disney\u2019s various properties.\n\nsource YouTube/The Streamable\n\nCourtesy of The Streamable\n\nDisney Plus offers up to seven profiles on a single account.\n\nsource YouTube/The Streamable\n\nChildren\u2019s accounts are themed to be more playful: They use brighter colors and feature more options geared toward the younger crowd (even though the entire service is family-friendly).\n\nsource YouTube/The Streamable\n\nCourtesy of The Streamable\n\nAll in all, Disney Plus should be familiar to anyone who uses Netflix; it even has similar row categories, like \u201cRecommended For You,\u201d based off you viewing habits. The best part though: Anything on Disney Plus can be downloaded for offline viewing. Your only limitation is the storage on your device.\n\nsource YouTube/The Streamable\n\nWhat do you think about Disney Plus?\n\nsource Disney\n\nSpecial thanks again to The Streamable for filming this video.
