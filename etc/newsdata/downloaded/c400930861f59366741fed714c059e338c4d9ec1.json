However, the singer was not happy with the magazine for using her image without her permission and doctoring it so heavily as well.\n\n'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' TAPS ALUM EDDIE MURPHY, TAYLOR SWIFT AND MORE FOR SEASON 45\n\n\u201cwhat the f--- is this s---,\u201d the upset star began her lengthy comment on Instagram. \u201c1. i was never approached by nylon about this piece whatsoever. i did not know it was happening nor did anyone on my team. 2. this is not even a real picture of me. i had absolutely no creative input. 3. youre gonna make a picture of me shirtless?? thats not real?? at 17? and make it the cover???? even if the picture was supposed to look like some robot version of me... i did not consent in any way. 4. ANNNDDD YOU\u2019RE GONNA REMOVE ALL MY F---IN HAIR? booooooooooo to you.\u201d\n\nEilish concluded her rebuke with a middle-finger emoji.\n\nShortly after Eilish\u2019s post, Nylon updated its post with a note explaining its actions.\n\nBILLIE EILISH, ARIANA GRANDE, LADY GAGA AND MORE MUSICIANS PLEDGE THEIR SUPPORT TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD\n\n\u201cFor this cover, it was never our intention to create a look that is confusing or insulting to Billie Eilish. It was only ever our intention to honor Billies impact and her work by creating this avatar which is part of a cover series highlighting the power of digital prodigy artists,\u201d reads the the clarification, directed at Eilish and her fans. \u201cThis avatar is a piece of 3D artwork created in dedication to her achievements and the positive effect she has had on millions around the globe - including us.\u201c\n\nEilish has not responded to the updated post on social media and her representatives did not immediately return Fox News\u2019 request for comment.\n\nThe star takes depictions of her body in the media very seriously. She previously explained to NME that part of the reason she wears baggy clothes is to dissuade people from speculation about her body.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken a lot to female artists about this, because if you\u2019re not a female artist you probably don\u2019t think about this,\u201d she explained. \u201cIf I was a guy and I was wearing these baggy clothes, nobody would bat an eye. There\u2019s people out there saying, \u2018Dress like a girl for once! Wear tight clothes you\u2019d be much prettier and your career would be so much better!\u2019 No it wouldn\u2019t.
