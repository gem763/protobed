Police defended the use of fire, saying it was a matter of life or death. The injured protester has now been criminally charged.On Saturday, the United Nations human rights chief called for an \"effective, prompt, independent and impartial investigation\" into acts of violence, including the shootings.The protests began in opposition to a bill that would have allowed the extradition of Hong Kong residents to mainland China, but have since spiraled into a broader anti-government movement that has plunged the international financial hub into its deepest crisis since the territory reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997.'Endangering our safety'All train and bus services throughout Hong Kong were suspended late Friday as rail operator MTR shut down the entire network that carries millions of passengers each day.The network said it was \"no longer in a position to provide safe and reliable service,\" claiming protesters had vandalized and set fires at multiple stations, with two of their station staff attacked and injured.Over 20 shopping malls around the territory also announced their closure Saturday due to safety concerns.\n\nAfter widespread violence, the government appealed for a public shift in attitude against rioting Saturday. Laurel Chor\n\nThe atmosphere on the streets was much quieter Saturday as hundreds of protesters marched, with some singing \"Glory to Hong Kong.\"Many called for a \"rest day\" in online forums and chats after the night of violence. More protests were expected Sunday.A protester named Joyce, who refused to give her last name out of fear of repercussions, was still wearing a mask as she marched Saturday near Sogo, one of Hong Kong's biggest malls.The 34-year-old banker told NBC News she doesn't accept the ban, which came into effect at midnight.\"This law is endangering our safety,\" she said. \"Carrie Lam said this anti-mask law is against people who resort to violence, and that she hoped it would de-escalate the situation. However, she never thought about why people are wearing masks even when the protests were peaceful. It is fear and distrust.\"\n\nShielded under umbrellas, hundreds of demonstrators clogged a thoroughfare in Hong Kong\\'s central business district. JORGE SILVA\n\nFreelance translator Rose Lu said she believes the ban on wearing masks will only inspire further public anger.\"We had previously said that this law will not solve anything, but the government insists on pushing it forward,\" Lu, 28, told NBC News. \"It clearly shows that the government is never bothered to listen to its people.\"She was handing out masks as she marched Saturday, but said she was not encouraging people to break the law.\"Whether or not to wear a mask, it's their freedom,\" Lu said.\"If people want to fight against this authoritative regime and to oppose this law, people are welcome to come and take a mask.\"", "description": "In a televised address, Chief Executive Carrie Lam defended Friday's move to invoke emergency powers in an effort to quell the growing unrest.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4208738/1000x563_nbc-1173651727_fd0a042223a3b811b9d47f788c7c3348.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
