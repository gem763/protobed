Retail demand was good after a long time,\u201d said Harshad Ajmera, the proprietor of JJ Gold House, a wholesaler in the eastern Indian city of Kolkata.\n\nDealers offered discounts of up to $4 an ounce over official domestic prices this week, the lowest since the first week of June.\n\nDiscounts have been falling due to lower imports in the last few months, but could widen again if demand falters after the festival, said Mukesh Kothari, director at Mumbai bullion dealer RiddiSiddhi Bullions.\n\nDiscounts of $8 were offered last week. The domestic price includes a 12.5% import tax and 3% sales tax\n\nHowever, high prices could push Diwali demand this weekend lower by 20% from last year, Anantha Padmanabhan, chairman of All India Gem and Jewellery Domestic Council said.\n\nGold futures were trading around 38,372 rupees per 10 grams on Friday, having hit a record 39,885 rupees last month en route to a roughly 22% gain so far in 2019.\n\n\u201cThe sharp price rise and deep discount in the bullion market impacted trade and the consumer outlook in (the) September quarter.
