The banks have a bit of trouble understanding it. It's an inter-generational investment.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company remains well capitalised, with a cash pile of $387 million and net assets of $327 million.\n\nA fully franked dividend of $232,047 was recommended for payment by the directors, down slightly on the $242,330 paid for 2017-18.\n\nThe builder has 1793 employees, up from 1637 the previous year, and was ranked Australia's sixth largest private company on 2019's Financial Review Top 500 Private Companies list.\n\nScott Hutchinson was in a dive boat off Cairns and unavailable for comment on Monday.", "description": "The builder owned by Queensland's Rich List Hutchinson family has received more than $3 billion from customers for the first time - but Ralan hasn't paid up.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7032%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1474%2C$y_884/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/fba22edc167fb8c75c7f813395ad5588bf1bb2ef", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
