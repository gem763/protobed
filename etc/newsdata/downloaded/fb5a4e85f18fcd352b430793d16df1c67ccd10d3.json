And if you're here at the conference you know exactly what I'm talking about.\n\n'It was a fireside chat with Ken Fisher. It was a true debacle. It was horrible. Things that were said by Ken Fisher were absolutely horrifying.'\n\nChalekian accused Fisher, who founded the Fisher Investments, of making comments about 'genitalia, talked about picking up on a girl and don't show em' what's in your pants'.\n\n'He made reference to Jeffrey Epstein, talked about charities are immoral, mentioned things about tripping on acid and other inappropriate comments.'\n\nChalekian said he also spoke to other men and women at the summit who shared the same thoughts about Fisher's chat.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nAlex Chalekian (left), the founder of Lake Avenue Financial, was the first to call Fisher (right) out for his comments in a video shared on social media.
