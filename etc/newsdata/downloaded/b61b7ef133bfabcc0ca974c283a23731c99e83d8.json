I think it would be much more fun to bring the ladies back.\n\n\"They're all still vital and in their prime and capable of doing so much that it would be great to see Bette and Kathy and Sarah come back together to do another movie and I think they would like to.\"", "description": "According to multiple reports Disney is developing a sequel to the 1993 classic for their new streaming platform Disney+", "authors": ["Courtney Pochin", "Image", "Disney"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20713164.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Hocus-Pocus.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
