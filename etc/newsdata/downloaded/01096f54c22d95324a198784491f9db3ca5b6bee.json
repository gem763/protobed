What we observed was that trust in the organisation has been on the decrease,\u201d said Reza Omar, strategic research director at Citizen Surveys.\n\n\u201cAlthough there was an increase in trust for a period of time, on July 23 Minister Mboweni tabled a special appropriation bill to provide an additional R59 billion to bail out Eskom over the next two years. As a result, we saw August\u2019s trust in Eskom drop to 45% as South Africans were told to foot the bill.\u201d\n\n\n\nOmar explained that following Mboweni\u2019s February budget speech, and in anticipation of the minister\u2019s speech next week, his organisation conducted a survey to determine what some of the prominent issues South Africans were facing were and what they wanted Mboweni to address.\n\nRead: Here\u2019s how the Eskom bailout will hike the budget deficit\n\nHe explained: \u201cWe asked a representative sample of 1300 South Africans who are 18 years and older from across the country the question: In your opinion what are the three most important issues the minister is expected to address? Eskom, the issue of tax and unemployment stood out.\u201d\n\nThe data shows that 78% of adult South Africans believe that unemployment is the biggest issue facing the country \u2013 a growth of 5% from Q2 2019. This is followed by crime, which has grown from 29% in Q2 to 39% in Q3.\n\nAccording to Sacs, South Africans will also be expecting Mboweni to address concerns around tax revenue because data from the survey revealed that the trust in the South African Revenue Service is currently on a decline\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe asked respondents if they thought that withholding tax payments is a legitimate form of protest against the government. 64% disagreed stating that it\u2019s \u201cwrong and that those who do should be punished under law\u201d, however 23% sympathised with those who refuses to pay and about 10% stated they would also do so if they had the chance, more than doubling since the beginning of 2018.\n\n\n\nTrust in the revenue service declined by 3% in Q3 2019 after reaching a 12-month high in Q2.\n\nRead: SA\u2019s economic paralysis is a leadership crisis\n\nAccording to Sacs \u201cMboweni\u2019s favourability rating has been declining significantly from 35% in June to 29% in July, followed by a further drop to 26% in August.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has a difficult path ahead. If he wants to forge the path to long-term growth, he will need to pay attention to the issues that are truly important to South Africans at present,\u201d\n\nThe consultancy firm added that: \u201cdespite President Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s high profile courting of investors to kick-start the economy, South Africans are expecting immediate and tangible feedback on the ANC\u2019s growth plan from Mboweni.\u201d", "description": "The state of Eskom, concerns around tax revenue and the dire unemployment crisis are just some of the issues Finance Minister Tito Mboweni is expected to address during his mid-term budget speech next week.", "authors": ["Staff Reporter"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9501/8ae430028f5e43ca8c7517e66716e359.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
