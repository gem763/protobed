Hopefully you give all the monetary gain to charities....\u2019\u201d one user commented beneath the photo of a Columbine hoodie.\n\nSomeone who claimed to have survived the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting where 26 people, some as young as 6, were killed, called the design \u201churtful\u201d and \u201cinconsiderate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI urge you to take it down out of respect for the victims, survivors and families,\u201d the post continued.\n\nAnother person commented: \u201cThe fact that u made a sweatshirt with holes in it representing BULLET HOLES from a shooting where children were MURDERED is gruesome. This is disgusting.\u201d\n\nFATHER OF PARKLAND SHOOTING VICTIM: \u2018GUNS DIDN\u2019T KILL MY DAUGHTER DEMOCRATIC POLICIES DID\u2019\n\nTwo other hoodies representing the shootings at Virginia Tech and Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School where 32 and 17 students were killed, respectively, were also featured on Owens\u2019 Instagram.\n\nOwens later posted a message on social media that appeared to explain the decision to design the clothing line after the shootings.\n\n\"Sometimes life can be painfully ironic. Like the irony of dying violently in a place you consider to be a safe, controlled environment, like school,\" he wrote. \"We are reminded all the time of life's fragility, shortness, and unpredictability yet we are also reminded of its infinite potential. It is this push and pull that creates the circular motion that is the cycle of life.\u201d\n\nOwens told NBC that while the clothes were originally meant to make a statement only, he and co-designer Duey Catorze might consider selling them now.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make a comment on gun violence and the type of gun violence that needs preventative attention and what its origins are, while also empowering the survivors of tragedy through storytelling in the clothes,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThese hoodies were made with all of these intentions in mind, and to explore all of these societal issues.\u201d", "description": "A New York-based fashion designer is facing major backlash after releasing a new line of hoodies inspired by a series of mass school shootings.", "authors": ["Paulina Dedaj", "Paulina Dedaj Is A Writer", "Reporter For Fox News.
