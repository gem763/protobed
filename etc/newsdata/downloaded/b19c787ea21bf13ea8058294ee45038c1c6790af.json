It\u2019s just one game, but the increased emphasis on play action \u2014 pretending to run only to pass instead \u2014 paid off against the Giants.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Focus, the Cowboys used play-action on 46.6% of their dropbacks, second-highest rate in the league. Three of Prescott\u2019s four touchdowns came from those plays.\n\nPlay action as part of an offensive arsenal is practically as old as football itself. But offensive gurus like Moore are perfecting the misdirection-based approach, and modern teams are embracing the philosophy, running more play action last season than all of this decade.\n\nAccording to Football Outsiders, 24% of all offensive plays last year were play action \u2014 up 22% from the year before, and the third straight year the average saw an increase.\n\nWhy the change? In a league that is so difficult to get players wide open, play-action serves as a way to create space, ESPN analyst and former quarterback Dan Orlovsky said.\n\n\u201cUnless they\u2019re freaks, unless they\u2019re the Julio Joneses, the next best way to do it is from a play-action,\u201d Orlovsky told The Washington Times earlier this month. \u201cFrom a very early age, defensive players hear \u2018Stop the run, Stop the run, Stop the run\u2019 and they hear that year after year after year.\n\n\u201cSo you get fully committed to stopping the run, (or) anything that looks like it.\u201d\n\nThat mindset, he said, conditions defenders to bite on the fake, freeing up playmakers in space.\n\nQuarterbacks are also benefiting from play action as reads get simplified to, in some cases, a single progression instead of having to read the entire defense. \u201cThere\u2019s some freedom in that as a quarterback,\u201d Orlovsky said.\n\nSome of the best offenses in the league thrive on fooling the defense. The Los Angeles Rams, who scored the second-most points per game in 2018, ran play-action a league-leading 36% on passing attempts last season. Rams coach Sean McVay has made that a staple of his offense and others are trying to follow suit.\n\nIf Dallas\u2018 heavy play-action usage under Moore continues, that will be a drastic shift from recent history. In 2018, the Cowboys ranked 13th with a 25% usage. Before that, they ranked 19th (22%) in 2017.\n\nInterestingly enough, the Cowboys ranked third in 2016 at 24% \u2014 the year when Prescott filled in for an injured Tony Romo and Dallas finished 13-3. Since then, their rate has more or less stayed the same, but there have been other teams who have passed them by.\n\nAgainst the Giants, the Cowboys looked explosive. If Moore continues to get the most of Prescott, the Redskins will have their hands full when the two teams meet Sunday.\n\n\u201cKellen\u2019s off to a really good start,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cHe\u2019s a really smart guy. We had him here as a player for a few years and he\u2019s one of those guys that you identify early on and say \u2018This guy could be a really good coach.\u2019 We were lucky to have him last year as our quarterback coach, and he\u2019s done a really nice job as a coordinator so far.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
