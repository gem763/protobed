Nana, my grandmother, wasn\u2019t grieving a husband who\u2019d died while serving in the Vietnam War like Julia was. Mom was a little older than Julia\u2019s son, Corey. Nana wasn\u2019t a nurse, though she\u2019d considered the profession, for all the reasons it made the character of Julia such a \u201crespectable\u201d one for black popular culture: The work paid enough to keep a small, single-income family above the poverty line. But my mom and Nana saw enough of themselves in the series to become regular viewers and fans.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEarly critics of \u201cJulia\u201d called it unrealistic. In an essay about the sitcom, media professor Aniko Bodroghkozy noted that \u201ccritics have castigated Julia for being extraordinarily out of touch with and silent on the realities of African American life in the late 1960s. While large numbers of blacks lived in exploding ghettos, Julia and Corey Baker lived a luxury lifestyle impossible on a nurse\u2019s salary.\u201d\n\nThough Julia and her son may have been better off financially than many black single-mother-led families, their existence as characters affirmed households that had long been vilified in American culture and American politics. Just three years before the sitcom\u2019s debut, U.S. Assistant Secretary of Labor Daniel Patrick Moynihan had written a report on the status of the black family. It asserted: \"The Negro community has been forced into a matriarchal structure which, because it is too out of line with the rest of the American society, seriously retards the progress of the group as a whole.\u201d\n\nDiahann Carroll saw things differently. In a November 1968 interview with Ebony magazine, she predicted: \u201cBlack children are going to have a marvelous time now. Their self-image is going to be so much higher.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf the popularity of \u201cJulia\u201d-themed lunch boxes and the \u201cJulia\u201d Barbie doll were any indication, she was absolutely right. Seeing the image of Carroll as a successful mother in the absence of a husband or live-in partner shaped my mother\u2019s outlook on herself and her family and, eventually, it would shape mine as well.\n\nCarroll\u2019s career, which spanned more than 60 years, reflected her early recognition of the value of nuanced depictions of black life. She understood the power of representation, long before catchphrases such as \u201cyou can\u2019t be what you don\u2019t see\u201d entered mainstream parlance.\n\nAs if in answer to those early \u201cJulia\u201d critics, Carroll returned with another seminal depiction of black single motherhood in the 1974 film \u201cClaudine.\u201d Carroll played a 36-year-old mother of six, the result of \u201ctwo marriages and two \u2018almost-marriages,\u2019 \u201d as her character clarifies in one scene.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf \u201cJulia\u201d was groundbreaking for being the first sitcom to star a black woman in a non-domestic role, \u201cClaudine\u201d was just as groundbreaking for its humanizing depiction of black domestic worker. That both women are single mothers, played by the same actress, is significant. The two parts prove that all that separates two black women is access and opportunity. Without advanced education and her husband\u2019s pension, Julia could have been Claudine\u2019s neighbor.\n\nCarroll, who married four times, was the mother of one child herself. In an interview in which she discussed having to convince casting directors that she was right for the role of Claudine, she noted, \u201cI\u2019ve seen her. Believe me. I\u2019ve lived next door to her. There were Claudines in my family.\u201d In her 2008 memoir \u201cThe Legs are the Last to Go: Aging, Acting, Marrying, and Other Things I Learned the Hard Way,\u201d she compared the two parts again: \u201cI loved the character who inhabited the gritty world Julia had assiduously avoided.\u201d\n\nBoth \u201cJulia\u201d and \u201cClaudine\u201d were released before I was born. But they weren\u2019t the last times Carroll would play a single mother. By the time I was coming of age, Carroll was doing a career victory lap. She\u2019d earned a Golden Globe Award for \u201cJulia\u201d and an Oscar nomination for \u201cClaudine.\u201d Before either of those, she\u2019d won a Tony Award for her performance in \u201cNo Strings.\u201d She\u2019d broken ground yet again in the popular 1980s nighttime soap opera \u201cDynasty.\u201d But my generation probably knows her best for her role in the 1990s sitcom \u201cA Different World.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShe played Marion Gilbert, wealthy divorcee and mother to one of the main characters, the pampered Southern belle, Whitley Gilbert. Marion was neither sweet like Julia nor hardscrabble like Claudine. In her minks and jewels, she had more in common with \u201cDynasty\u2019s\u201d Dominique Deveraux, incidentally, another of Carroll\u2019s divorced-and-parenting roles. Motherhood for Marion meant finishing school and marrying well. It meant ensuring that her daughter studiously avoided any hardship she\u2019d faced growing up. It meant draping herself and her child in whatever finery she could afford and modeling for her what it meant to both to survive and to thrive.\n\nOn \u201cA Different World,\u201d Diahann Carroll was proving yet again that black single motherhood is multitudinous. It contains moments of transcendence and desperation, desire and self-consciousness, regality and indignity. There is no one way to approach it. How fortunate we are that her body of work offers us such beautiful reminders.\n\nRead more:\n\nNekesa Mumbi Moody: Diahann Carroll, Tony-winning and pathbreaking actress, dies at 84\n\nBethonie Butler: Without Diahann Carroll, we wouldn\u2019t have Olivia Pope\n\nKrissah Thompson: A starlet of the civil rights era, Diahann Carroll looks back on a career of firsts\n\nKrissah Thompson: We asked black mothers how they find their joy.
