MUST WATCH Pat takes on Grigor Dimitrov 01:00\n\nWho, then, could have foreseen Dimitrov upsetting pal and sometimes singing buddy Federer -- albeit an ailing one -- in the quarterfinals and reaching the last four in New York?\n\nNot even Dimitrov himself, as it turned out.\n\n\"Me, too,\" he agreed with a reporter Tuesday who said he didn't expect the 28-year-old to go this far after he'd fallen to King two months ago.\n\nRanking tumbles\n\nAlthough Dimitrov has never really fulfilled expectations -- perhaps they were always too high, since his shots might resemble Federer but don't have as much sting, especially on the backhand -- a ranking below 50th looks strange for someone of his still plentiful ability.\n\nHere was the man who won the year-end championships as recently as two years ago, surging to No. 3 in the world.\n\nA shoulder injury was the big reason his ranking, and confidence, tumbled this year, only to be restored at precisely the right time for him.\n\nFollowing the injury, he might feel getting a walkover in the second round against 12th seed Borna Coric, a navigable draw to the quarterfinals and Federer's back and neck injury were the considerable dose of luck he was owed.\n\n\"I think the past six, seven months have been pretty rough for me,\" said Dimitrov, well liked by his peers. \"But I had somebody to lean on, my friends, my family.\n\n\"I kept on believing again in the work, the rehab I had to put behind my shoulder, the exercise, the practice, fixing up the racket a little bit. There were so many things I had to adjust in such a small but big period of time.\n\n\"Next thing you know, you're almost end of the year, you have a result like that. It's pretty special to me.\"\n\nPretty special and in another way, pretty rare, since Dimitrov admitted he is in New York without coaches Andre Agassi and Radek Stepanek, the pair who formerly guided world No. 1 Novak Djokovic.\n\nIt could get even better for Dimitrov, who is sure to return to around the top 25 after the US Open.\n\nA chance against Medvedev?\n\nOn paper he won't be favored against one of the tour's most in-form players in fifth-seed Daniil Medvedev on Friday, but the Russian who has played villain for most of the US Open is dealing with an array of injuries.\n\nThe latest one was a quadriceps issue sustained in a four-set win over Stan Wawrinka in what was a double blow for Swiss fans Tuesday.\n\nOne of the two will land in a maiden grand slam final.\n\nFederer's exit means three of the so-called Big Four didn't make the quarterfinals, and if Rafael Nadal loses to Diego Schwartzman in Wednesday's night session, it would mark the first time since the 2004 French Open that none of Federer, Nadal, Djokovic or Andy Murray appeared in a grand slam semifinal.\n\nDimtrov, 24th-seed Berrettini and the rest, would probably feel the men's title would be up for grabs.\n\nThe big-serving Berrettini converted on his fifth match point to knock out 13th-seed Monfils 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 7-6(5) in three hours, 57 minutes.\n\nMatteo Berrettini celebrates after beating Gael Monfils to reach the US Open semifinals.\n\nThe French showman initially had a set and break advantage but eventually came unstuck, hitting 17 double faults and two in the tiebreak in a battle that ended under the roof due to rain on a steamy New York day.\n\nMind you, Berrettini, 23, hit one himself on his first match point at 5-4 in the fifth, paving the way for a nail biting conclusion.\n\nSerena Williams is the women's favorite, with her bid for a record-equaling 24th grand slam title continuing in the semifinals Thursday against Monfils' girlfriend, Elina Svitolina.\n\nBelinda Bencic became the first women's semifinalist from the top half when the No. 13 seed edged Donna Vekic 7-6(5), 6-3 to start play Wednesday at Arthur Ashe Stadium. The match turned when Vekic -- appearing in her first grand slam quarterfinal -- couldn't serve out the first set at 5-4.", "description": "Grigor Dimitrov came into the US Open slumping and ranked 78th, but he's turned it all around in New York after being hampered by a shoulder injury this year.", "authors": ["Ravi Ubha"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190904172433-dimitrov-super-tease.jpg"}
