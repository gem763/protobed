Who can better relate to such a sentiment than someone who retreated from the public eye for four years, only to return to vicious commentary about her appearance? Zellweger\u2019s struggles may not have involved Garland\u2019s addictions and custody battle, but the 50-year-old actor nonetheless brings a meta connection to the renaissance she\u2019s currently enjoying on behalf of \u201cJudy.\u201d\n\nIn the rousing showbiz lark \u201cChicago,\u201d which came on the heels of her star-making turns in \u201cJerry Maguire\u201d and \u201cBridget Jones\u2019s Diary,\u201d Zellweger played a striver seduced by the glitz of fame. In \u201cJudy,\u201d she plays a bigwig hiding from it. Aa thoroughly as she morphs into Garland, that famous Zellweger panache doesn\u2019t go anywhere. The acting tics that made her a powerhouse of the 2000s \u2015 distended lips, shy smile, breathy vehemence, fidgety arms \u2015 are essential here. Those years when Hollywood reduced her to the dowdy wife (\u201cCinderella Man\u201d) or the self-absorbed clich\u00e9 (\u201cNew in Town\u201d), only to later question why she could have wanted to escape herself cosmetically, become the fulcrum for Zellweger\u2019s rebound.\n\nWatching \u201cJudy,\u201d which chronicles its subject\u2019s final year, specifically her five-week residency at a London nightclub in 1969, is like watching Zellweger walk a tightrope. Can she pull off the complex physicality and robust contralto? Garland\u2019s fans used to wonder the same thing. When Zellweger soars, so does your heart. The movie is most alive during her musical numbers. Judy takes the stage to perform \u201cOver the Rainbow,\u201d and it\u2019s a once-in-a-lullaby trance \u2014 an artist who is, finally, where she\u2019s meant to be, just as Zellweger is meant to be onscreen. That\u2019s a triumphant arc, as if the movie exists to remind us what brought Zellweger to our attention in the first place. The story of a Hollywood dignitary subsumed by an industry that applies heightened scrutiny to women finds added resonance.\n\nRoadside Attractions Ren\u00e9e Zellweger in \"Judy,\" opening Sept. 27.\n\nZellweger is one of several stars appearing in Oscar-season vehicles that directly or indirectly comment on their storied careers \u2014 roles that flourish because it\u2019s this person inhabiting that character. There\u2019s Eddie Murphy portraying a profane comedian in \u201cDolemite Is My Name,\u201d Adam Sandler testing the limits of a protagonist\u2019s unlikeability in \u201cUncut Gems\u201d and Shia LaBeouf reckoning with his aggro notoriety in \u201cHoney Boy.\u201d\n\nAll four actors, whose movies screened at the Toronto International Film Festival in September, have hit something of an impasse in recent years, either vanishing entirely or hitting the same notes time and again. Now, a timeless movie-star trial follows: How do their respective legacies inform this chapter, and what will it take to get audiences to see them in a different light?\n\nMurphy, like Zellweger, discovered Hollywood lost any sense of what to do with him. Once ranked among comedy\u2019s most reliable leading men, he scaled back on live-action work after his \u201cDreamgirls\u201d boon gave way to \u201cNorbit\u201d (2007), \u201cMeet Dave\u201d (2008) and \u201cImagine That\u201d (2009). Critics savaged all three films, and the box-office revenue was equally rough. Murphy\u2019s fast-talking theatrics \u2014 so winning in edgy \u201980s and \u201990s hallmarks like \u201cBeverly Hills Cop,\u201d \u201cComing to America\u201d and \u201cBowfinger\u201d \u2014 had become one-joke gambits. If \u201cThe Nutty Professor\u201d flaunted his range, it also turned into a curse. Afterward, most writers handed him increasingly childish buffoonery (\u201cThe Adventures of Pluto Nash,\u201d \u201cDaddy Day Care\u201d).\n\nHis late-2000s decline called Murphy\u2019s longevity (and decision-making) into question right as Hollywood was shifting from a star-driven marketplace to a franchise-driven one. \u201cI don\u2019t whore myself out as easily as I used to,\u201d Murphy told Rolling Stone in 2011, a sentiment he re-emphasized to Ellen DeGeneres two years later: \u201cI don\u2019t wanna do anything else that sucks ever again.\u201d\n\nNetflix Eddie Murphy in \"Dolemite Is My Name,\" opening Oct. 4.\n\nWith \u201cDolemite Is My Name,\u201d Murphy lives up to his promise. (Let\u2019s just forget 2016\u2019s maudlin \u201cMr. Church,\u201d a magical-Negro blight if ever there was one.) Not only does \u201cDolemite\u201d not suck; it also identifies with Murphy\u2019s struggle to find ace material as he ages, much in the way that \u201cJudy\u201d softly comments on Zellweger\u2019s history. In bawdy stand-up comic Rudy Ray Moore, whose under-the-radar career soared after he poured all his might and money into the 1975 blaxploitation romp \u201cDolemite,\u201d Murphy finds a kindred spirit. Like him, Moore\u2019s presence was that of a coarse jokester with a vulnerable core, equal parts demanding and defenseless.\n\nRudy is so accustomed to rejection \u2014 and so defiant in the face of it \u2014 that, when his passion project wins over audiences at its Los Angeles premiere, the beam on his face acts as catharsis. At the premiere in Toronto, \u201cDolemite Is My Name\u201d director Craig Brewer (\u201cHustle & Flow\u201d) called the film Murphy\u2019s own passion project. Surely it was gratifying for the actor, who was there in the room, to hear the crowd\u2019s raucous laughter and to know that he, too, is worthy of another shot.\n\nInterestingly enough, one of Murphy\u2019s comedy peers is playing around with his legacy in adjacent ways. Adam Sandler, another funnyman who parlayed \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d renown into blockbuster clout, pulls off something that only a beloved movie star can: He makes you love him in spite of the loathsome character he portrays.\n\nSandler has long tested audiences\u2019 patience for infantile dimwits, from \u201cBilly Madison\u201d and \u201cThe Waterboy\u201d to \u201cBig Daddy\u201d and \u201cLittle Nicky.\u201d But in the 2000s, he found opportunities to broaden that palette. \u201cPunch-Drunk Love\u201d capitalized on his uncouth persona for a deceptively graceful romantic comedy, while \u201cReign Over Me\u201d and \u201cFunny People\u201d showed he could telegraph grief without sacrificing charm. When Sandler revisited his old ways, he seemed listless, as if he\u2019d tasted lobster but was stuck eating boiled eggs again. And yet the Netflix production deal he signed in 2014, which yielded four antic-laden comedies in which he looked particularly bored (see also: this year\u2019s \u201cMurder Mystery,\u201d which wasn\u2019t part of that arrangement), generated massive viewership.\n\nA24 Adam Sandler in \"Uncut Gems,\" opening Dec. 13.\n\nSibling directors Josh and Benny Safdie, who toyed with Robert Pattinson\u2019s matinee-idol image in 2017\u2019s \u201cGood Time,\u201d know how capitalize on Sandler\u2019s skills in \u201cUncut Gems.\u201d Presenting the movie at a screening in Toronto, the Safdie brothers said they wrote the role of Howard Ratner, a skeezy New York diamond dealer, specifically for Sandler. He turned it down, then wisely changed his mind. In Sandler\u2019s hands, Howard\u2019s intense unlikability is almost an afterthought. (The movie begins with his colonoscopy, which is poetic because he\u2019s such an asshole.) Howard lies to his clients, cheats on his wife, disregards his kids. He\u2019s childish, but not in the clownish manner that Sandler usually exhibits.\n\nAll id, Sandler wears a smug smile on his face. He\u2019s more gleeful and engaged than we\u2019ve seen in years (\u201cThe Meyerowitz Stories\u201d being an arguable exception). His eyes are wider, his forehead more expressive. Employing their signature kinetic style, the Safdie brothers cede the screen to Sandler\u2019s every move, the camera drifting around him as though he is directing the action. If Murphy\u2019s grin in \u201cDolemite Is My Name\u201d is happy-go-lucky, Sandler\u2019s in \u201cUncut Gems\u201d is testy-go-lucky. (Coincidentally, the Safdies are reportedly set to direct a remake of Murphy\u2019s breakout movie, \u201c48 Hrs.\u201d)\n\nWere a lesser-known actor to play Howard, \u201cGems\u201d might not work. It\u2019s hard to spend two hours in the company of someone that incorrigible without established affection for the person inhabiting him. But here, because Sandler seems so enlivened by the material, it\u2019s a treat to watch him feel his way through Howard\u2019s recklessness \u2014 a movie star doing what only a movie star can do.\n\nThe same goes for Shia LaBeouf. His role in \u201cHoney Boy\u201d is direct autobiography, pulling from his volatile life as a child star with an abusive father who once turned a gun on him. As LaBeouf aged, offscreen blunders (street fights, arrests) and oddities (hitchhiking, that paper bag) overshadowed his acting, even though he was often just as feral onscreen (\u201cNymphomaniac,\u201d \u201cAmerican Honey,\u201d \u201cBorg vs. McEnroe\u201d). It seemed like he was melting down in real time, stricken by PTSD, substance abuse and unrelenting hostility. So he turned his pain into art, writing the script for \u201cHoney Boy\u201d during rehab.\n\nAmazon Studios Shia LaBeouf in \"Honey Boy,\" opening Nov. 8.\n\nBut instead of playing himself, LaBeouf does something more daring: He plays his dad. How\u2019s that for a therapy session? (\u201cA Quiet Place\u201d breakout Noah Jupe portrays LaBeouf\u2019s \u201cEven Stevens\u201d-era analog, and Lucas Hedges portrays him as an angry young adult in a treatment center.)\n\nIt\u2019s a raw and gritty but somehow forgiving performance that presents his father \u2014 and, in turn, himself \u2014 as both wounded and egotistical. LaBeouf\u2019s receding hairline is matched by a grizzled Southern accent that couldn\u2019t be further removed from his days as a \u201cTransformers\u201d stooge. He spends most of the movie on the verge of a breakdown, blurring the lines between character and self-flagellation. The results don\u2019t necessarily absolve LaBeouf\u2019s misdeeds, but they do reframe his image. There\u2019s more to him than the privileged brat we saw in headlines.\n\nThat\u2019s what accomplished movies can achieve for stars whose reputations have been digested by a fickle public. LaBeouf, Sandler, Murphy and Zellweger are enacting what is proverbially called \u201ccareer rehab.\u201d By acknowledging, directly or indirectly, what has befallen them in recent years, they ensure a path forward. And by demonstrating a self-awareness that sometimes evades the rich and influential, they lob a middle finger at the forces that reduced them to ciphers. \u201cJudy,\u201d \u201cDolemite Is My Name,\u201d \u201cUncut Gems\u201d and \u201cHoney Boy\u201d are testaments to films tailor-made for their leads, a rarity in a superhero-saturated landscape. They hound people in this world, but those people get the fiercest comebacks.", "description": "Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Eddie Murphy, Adam Sandler and Shia LaBeouf step into rich roles that double as meta commentary on their careers.", "authors": ["Entertainment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8a42322200003300fbb906.jpeg?cache=rjlfvggdrn&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
