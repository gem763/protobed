The call is the subject of the whistleblower's complaint, which the intelligence community inspector general found both credible and of \"urgent concern.\" As a result, it was supposed to be turned over to the House Intelligence Committee, but the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has declined to submit the complaint to the committee because he determined that it was not of urgent concern.\n\nMr. Trump said in a pair of tweets Tuesday that he's authorizing the release \"of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine.\"\n\n\"You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time,\" his tweet read.\n\nBiden says Trump should be impeached if he doesn't comply with Congress\n\nAt least one week before Mr. Trump spoke with Zelensky in late July, he instructed his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to hold off on releasing nearly $400 million in military aid for Ukraine that had already been appropriated by Congress, CBS News' Major Garrett confirmed. Ultimately, the White House released the funds to Ukraine in September, after withholding the aid for about two months.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate unanimously passed a non-binding resolution Tuesday calling on the Trump administration to release the whistleblower's complaint.\n\nThe top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has also written three letters to federal government officials seeking more information about the withholding of security funding for Ukraine.\n\nWhen asked on Tuesday about his decision to hold back aid to Ukraine shortly before his call with the Ukrainian president, Mr. Trump said it was because he \"wanted other countries to put up money.\"", "description": "The director of national intelligence is refusing to release the whistleblower's complaint to Congress.
