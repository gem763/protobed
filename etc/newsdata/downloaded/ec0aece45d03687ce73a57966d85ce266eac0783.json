But the Redskins failed to score just outside the red zone when kicker Dustin Hopkins missed a 39-yard attempt.\n\nSan Francisco, however, hasn\u2019t been much better. Robbie Gould missed a 45-yarder and quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo is just 3 of 10 for 10 yards through two quarters.\n\nThe Redskins out-gained San Francisco 118-68 in yards.\n\nIt was the first scoreless opening half league-wide since 2017.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
