Biden, then impeachment \u201cmay be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that conduct represents.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe may very well have crossed the Rubicon here,\u201d Mr. Schiff told CNN\u2019s State of the Union.\n\nMr. Schiff, California Democrat, said he views impeachment as a \u201clast resort\u201d and extreme remedy, pushing back at Democrats who say the House should have begun the process after the release of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian election meddling.\n\nThe congressman said Capitol Hill colleagues might have, however, been pushed to the edge by reports suggesting Mr. Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into Mr. Biden\u2019s efforts to oust a prosecutor in 2016.\n\n\u201cThis would be, I think, the most profound violation of the presidential oath,\u201d Mr. Schiff said.\n\nMr. Trump is suggesting that Mr. Biden tried to insulate his son, Hunter Biden, who had business interests in Ukraine.\n\nThe president reportedly urged Mr. Zelensky \u201cabout eight times\u201d to cooperate with his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani on investigating Hunter Biden.\n\nA July 25 call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky is reportedly at the heart of a whistleblower complaint that an inspector general for the intelligence community dubbed credible and urgent.\n\nMr. Trump said Sunday he did nothing wrong during the call, though Mr. Schiff said the president is too scared to prove it, citing his efforts to block Joseph Maguire, his acting director of national intelligence, from handing over the whistleblower complaint.\n\n\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t the president simply release the transcript of that call?\u201d Mr. Schiff, California Democrat, said.\n\n\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t the president just say, \u2018Release the whistleblower complaint?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Democratic congressman also dismissed a statement from Ukrainian foreign minister, who said there was \u201cno pressure\u201d from Mr. Trump during the call.\n\nMr. Schiff said Ukraine has been put in an impossible position, since it relies on the Trump administration for military aid.\n\n\u201cThis president is nothing but vindictive,\u201d Mr. Schiff said.\n\nAbout $250 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine was released Sept. 12, after a delay. Democrats say they\u2019re worried the money was held up as part of Mr. Trump\u2019s push to have the Bidens investigated.\n\nMr. Schiff said he will fight Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to block the whistleblower complaint.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to play rope-a-dope in the court for weeks on end,\u201d Mr. Schiff said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
