I reveled in it,\" the self-made billionaire says in the Netflix three-episode documentary series \"Inside Bill's Brain.\" \"I didn't believe in weekends, I didn't believe in vacation.\"\n\nBut by the time he reached his mid-40s, \"my perspective was changing,\" Gates says, and \"my world view was broadening.\" In 2000, he and his wife, Melinda, launched their foundation, which works to reduce inequity across the globe. They transferred $20 billion of Microsoft stock to the Gates Foundation and started traveling abroad to study health problems in poor countries.\n\nThe more involved he became with the foundation, the more he realized that his future career wasn't going to center around building software products.", "description": "\"If you'd have asked me in my twenties if I'd ever retire early from Microsoft, I'd have told you that you were crazy,\" says Bill Gates, who ended up leaving Microsoft nearly a decade earlier than he intended.", "authors": ["Kathleen Elkins"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106078911-1565798697853billgatesspeakstothemedia.jpg?v=1568726042", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
