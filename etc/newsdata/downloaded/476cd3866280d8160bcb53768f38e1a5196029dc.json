What good will it do? And what\u2019s it like to reveal your most private relationship concerns to a stranger?\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t uncommon for people to be fearful of couples therapy and often avoid getting the help they need because of these fears,\u201d said Alicia H. Clark, a psychologist and author of Hack Your Anxiety: How to Make Anxiety Work For You in Life, Love, and All That You Do.\n\n\u201cGetting answers to some common questions about therapy can give you the courage to reach out, though,\u201d she said.\n\nWith that in mind, we asked Clark and other therapists to respond to some of the most common questions people have about going to couples counseling.\n\n1. \u201cHow long will we have to be in therapy?\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s not beat around the bush here: Therapy may take up a good hour or so during the week, and it\u2019s not always cheap. (Looking for a few ways to cut the cost? This guide breaks down how you can keep things affordable.)\n\nGiven both of those concerns, many couples are curious how long they\u2019ll be putting in face time with their therapist. Usually, it\u2019s something therapists assess and make a plan for during the first session, said Stephanie Macadaan, a therapist in Los Angeles, California.\n\n\u201cTherapy is going to take a bit longer if there\u2019s been an injury to the relationship, such as an affair or betrayal,\u201d she told HuffPost. \u201cIn that case, there\u2019s likely a lot of anger and resentment built up and therapy will take quite a bit longer, most likely up to a year.\u201d\n\nIf your relationship isn\u2019t too off course, and the objective is to strengthen your communication, therapy typically takes about three to six months, Macadaan said. (But that only applies if you\u2019re consistent about going to therapy sessions. Don\u2019t forget to set those Google calendar alerts!)\n\n2. \u201cWill the therapist take sides?\u201d\n\nmkakade711@gmail.com via Getty Images Your therapist may take notes, but she's not docking you points for bad behavior.\n\nIn marriage therapy, your counselor\u2019s \u201cclient\u201d is your relationship, so choosing sides would be counterproductive. Sure, their job is to analyze and judge the situation, but they\u2019re trying to mend and improve your relationship, not drive you further apart, said Spencer Northey, a marriage and family therapist at DC Counseling and Psychotherapy Center.\n\n\u201cMarriage therapists are trained to see both perspectives,\u201d she said. \u201cThey focus on the needs of the partnership, not just one person\u2019s. There may be moments or even whole sessions when one person gets more attention, but overall, both members of the couple should be heard, understood and supported.\u201d\n\n3. \u201cIs it OK if I go alone?\u201d\n\nCouples therapy is more productive if both parties are present. But even going alone can benefit your marriage and help you identify where you and your partner are most at odds, said Kurt Smith, a therapist who specializes in counseling men.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still helpful,\u201d he said. \u201cI do couples therapy all of the time with only one partner participating, especially since a lot of men refuse to come. More than a few will give in when you call their bluff by going without them.\u201d\n\n4. \u201cIs it OK if we talk about sex?\u201d\n\nDefinitely. Whatever is \u2015 or isn\u2019t \u2015 happening between the sheets is worth talking about during sessions. Keep in mind that if you\u2019re having a specific medical problem, your therapist is likely to point you in the direction of a specialist, said Laurel Steinberg, psychotherapist in New York City.\n\n\u201cIf there is a particular sexual issue or sexual dysfunction that you or your partner are experiencing, consider seeking out someone who has extensive training in this area, such as a clinical sexologist or urologist,\u201d she said.\n\n5. \u201cShould we talk about what was discussed in therapy outside of therapy?\u201d\n\nHero Images via Getty Images It's fine to talk about what you discussed in therapy outside of your sessions.\n\nUnlike \u201cFight Club,\u201d you definitely can talk about what happens in therapy outside of therapy. The only exception is if you and your partner have poor communication skills, said Elisabeth LaMotte, therapist and founder of the DC Counseling & Psychotherapy Center.\n\n\u201cWhen I am working with a couple that identifies a need to improve their communication skills, I suggest that they table difficult conversations following the session until their communication skills improve,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I work with couples who experience less volatility, they often find it helpful to continue the intense conversations that come up in therapy.\u201d\n\n6. \u201cIs therapy going to save my relationship?\u201d\n\nTherapy isn\u2019t a magic bullet that will change your marriage overnight. Therapy is a place for you to work through your relationship problems while hopefully gaining some understanding and insights, but a therapist alone can\u2019t repair your marriage, said Ryan Howes, a clinical psychologist in Pasadena, California.\n\nHowes likened that expectation to going to exercise at the gym and then blaming 24 Hour Fitness for failing to help you shed some pounds.\n\n\u201cThe gym is a place for you to do your work, but the effort is yours, as is the potential for failure,\u201d he said. \u201cIf working out fails, the gym itself is rarely the culprit. The same with therapist; if it doesn\u2019t save the marriage, it\u2019s most likely because one of the partners isn\u2019t willing to do the work, or because the problems are too large for the therapy to resolve.\u201d\n\n7. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work before, so why would it work now?\u201d\n\nCaiaimage/Agnieszka Olek via Getty Images Don't rule out therapy just because it didn't work in the past.\n\nThis might not be your first rodeo when it comes to couples counseling. Don\u2019t let negative or so-so results in the past limit your openness to going again, Smith said.\n\n\u201cSome of the couples I work with say they didn\u2019t find it helpful previously so they\u2019re resistant to going a second or third time \u2015 they feel it\u2019s a waste of time,\u201d he said. \u201cI tell them that sometimes the timing is just not right and one or both of you aren\u2019t yet ready to make the changes needed.\u201d\n\n8. \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t like the therapist? Is it OK to try someone else?\u201d\n\nFinding a therapist is a bit like dating: Ideally, you find someone you connect with quickly, delete all your dating apps and call it a day. But just like dating, not every pairing is going to be a match, Clark said. (The good news? Most therapists will offer a free 10- to 15-minute phone consultation so you can get a feel for their style before you step into their office.)", "description": "Don't let these common concerns keep you from seeking couples counseling.", "authors": ["Senior Lifestyle Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5be09ea63c000091030e2393.jpeg?cache=c2ZA0kmPXd&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2018-11-06"}
