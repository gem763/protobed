We put him to bed with paracetamol and ibuprofen.\n\nHenry was \u2018fit and healthy\u2019 before he became unwell (Picture: NHS England/SWNS)\n\nHe struggled to breathe or walk along a corridor while unwell (Picture: NHS England/SWNS)\n\n\u2018The next day he was really poorly, very hot, struggled breathing, so we called an ambulance and within a few minutes he had been rushed to hospital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018A few minutes more in A&E and he was taken theatre and put to sleep and he was taken to intensive care.\n\n\u2018It was really scary. They couldn\u2019t look after him in our hospital so they transferred him to Bristol paediatric intensive care unit, where he was on a ventilator for three days.\n\n\u2018But he was really lucky and did recover really well, enough to come back to our local hospital where he stayed for another two weeks.\n\n\u2018We had lots of physiotherapy, getting him to breathe again. He couldn\u2019t stand up, he couldn\u2019t walk.\n\n\u2018He\u2019d gone in a few days from being a fit, healthy eight-year-old boy to not being able to walk down the corridor, it was really sad.\u2019\n\nAll primary school children are now eligible for a free flu vaccination, and Public Health England wants to increase the rate of youngsters being given the nasal spray.\n\nParents will be asked to complete a consent form allowing their child to be vaccinated.\n\nAround 60 percent of school aged children in the South Wet took up the vaccine last year.\n\nHenry\u2019s mum Janine wants to warn other parents of just how bad flu can be (Picture: NHS England/SWNS)\n\nDr Julie Yates, head of screening and immunisation at Public Health England South West, said: \u2018We are so pleased that Year 6 children are now eligible for the flu vaccine which means that all children in primary school can now have this vaccination at school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Flu is a really nasty bug and it is not like having a cold. It can have serious complications and can be life threatening.\n\n\u2018At the very least it can knock you off your feet for days.\n\n\u2018This means absence from school for children and time off work for parents, not to mention the possibility of spreading the bug in families especially in the older more vulnerable community.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
