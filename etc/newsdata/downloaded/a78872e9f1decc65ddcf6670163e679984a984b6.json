Some 70 restaurants also had their outdoor terraces destroyed as rioters burned chairs and parasols on the barricades, causing around \u20ac2m in damage to property.\n\n\u201cLast week was a lost week from the point of view of restaurateurs,\u201d Pallarols said. \u201cThings are quiet now but if this continues restaurants will have to lay off staff because the profit margins are very small.\u201d\n\nSome of the worst rioting was in Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, the city\u2019s upmarket shopping street, where around 60% of sales are to tourists.\n\n\u201cSales were down around 30% over the week,\u201d said Luis Sans, president of the Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia association. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a return to normality now but the short term is one thing, another is the effect these images will have had on people\u2019s desire to come to Barcelona.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of damage but at least, unlike the gilets jaunes in Paris, the demonstrators didn\u2019t set out to destroy shops and restaurants.\u201d\n\nManel Casals, head of the Barcelona hoteliers association, said there have been cancellations but relatively few, although he has no figures as yet. \u201cWhat we are seeing is fewer people are making reservations than is normal at this time of year.\u201d\n\nThe same is happening with Airbnb and other holiday apartment platforms. According AirDNA, which analyses the short-term rental market, reservations for the week from 14 October, when the protests began, were down by nearly 1,000 on the same week last year, from 12,515 to 11,537.\n\nTourism accounts for 15% of Barcelona\u2019s GDP and the hotel business alone has a turnover of some \u20ac1.6bn. The tourism industry employs around 100,000 people, 40,000 of them directly.\n\nAs well as tourism, Barcelona is one of the world\u2019s favourite conference venues. There are conferences every day of the week but the real money-spinner is the Mobile World Conference. Last year the 100,000 visitors to the congress spent \u20ac473m while creating 14,000 temporary jobs. The current contract with the city expires in 2023.\n\n\u201cConferences are organised a long way in advance and aside from an American convention I don\u2019t know of any cancellations,\u201d said Christoph Tessmar, director of the Barcelona Tourism Convention Bureau. \u201cIn recent years Barcelona has had to confront major crises but has maintained its position as a world leader for conferences, although the images we\u2019ve seen in recent days could have a negative impact in the short term.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A police stand-off with protesters in Barcelona last week.

At least three cruise ships carrying a total of 6,000 passengers opted not to dock in the city during the disturbances. However, the financial impact will have been felt more by the port authorities than the city as cruise passengers spend little when they go ashore.\n\nAccording to the government, ports, railways and airports between them have lost about \u20ac4m as a result of the protests. Altogether, around 175,000 travellers were affected either by cancellations or delays caused by road blocks.\n\nFor now, everyone is banking on Barcelona\u2019s famed capacity for resilience. During the crisis in 2017, when the city was rocked by both a terrorist attack and the illegal declaration of independence, thousands of businesses moved their headquarters out of Catalonia. However, the city bounced back and Sans believes that the political uncertainty in 2017 made the situation worse than it is now.\n\n\u201cThese events can damage the city\u2019s image but this conflict isn\u2019t going to continue forever and we\u2019ll get back to normal,\u201d said Gabriel Jen\u00e9, president of Barcelona Oberta. \u201cWe\u2019re more worried about the ability of politicians to deal with the conflict than the capacity of the city to overcome it.\u201d", "description": "Trade reportedly falls 60% in some areas, with concern about disturbances\u2019 long-term effect", "authors": ["Stephen Burgen"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a41ea055d9551130848838472eb69a7a011f1a58/0_171_5046_3028/master/5046.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=78d72ab3916bb27313fe5cf653c7d965", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
