The firm fell short of the 100,000 vehicle deliveries that Tesla CEO Elon Musk mentioned in an email to employees in September. If Tesla had hit 100,000 vehicles delivered it would have been the first time the firm had reached that threshold in a single quarter which Musk stated would be \u201can incredibly exciting milestone for our company.\u201d\n\nThe third-quarter numbers exceeded Tesla\u2019s delivery figures of 95,200 in the second quarter and is above last year\u2019s third-quarter figures of 83,500. Although the third-quarter figures show growth for Tesla, the company is now on pace to fall well short of Musk\u2019s full-year production goals. Many feel that they show that once again CEO Elon Musk has overpromised and undelivered.\n\nGene Munster, a managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures, commented to Bloomberg: \u201cWhen Elon Musk says they are aiming for 100,000 deliveries, you are hoping for 102,000. Not 97,000. This is a credibility hit. This is a textbook example of Elon not being disciplined and having difficulty managing expectations.\u201d\n\nDan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush who advises a hold status on Tesla stock, stated: \u201cIf you look at the mix of S and X deliveries to Model 3s, profitability is likely to be a challenge.\u201d Kevin Tynan, a senior autos analyst at Bloomberg stated: \u201cTesla\u2019s missed 3Q delivery target and 2% sequential volume gain may be a sign that pushing into untapped markets isn\u2019t the demand bonanza the company expected. China will be key to boosting deliveries by the 8% needed in 4Q \u2014 to a record 105,000 \u2014 to reach the bottom of Tesla\u2019s guidance.\u201d\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
