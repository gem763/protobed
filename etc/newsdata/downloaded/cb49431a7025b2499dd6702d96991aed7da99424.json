We\u2019ll take a comprehensive look across the DFS industry to uncover these core recommendations, factoring respective salaries into the analysis.\n\nPlease note, these player picks were organized early in the day. For MLB contests, always check lineups and weather closer to game time. Rain, wind, or unexpected managerial decisions could open up additional sources of value. Be sure to keep an eye on the MLB Headlines and Injuries desk.\n\nWe will be looking at the five-game main slate starting at 7:05 ET.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nPITCHER\n\nSteven Matz - NY Mets (vs. Miami)\n\nMy colleague Brad Johnson dubbed Matz a \u201cmid-tier must play\u201d in his MLB DFS Bargains column for tonight\u2019s slate. I\u2019d have to agree with that title, as Matz finds himself in a welcoming home matchup against one of the worst hitting teams in baseball. He\u2019s a -245 favorite with an excellent opportunity to post a quality start. The only thing in the way is the weather, as there\u2019s a chance for in-game showers. You\u2019ll want to keep an eye on that as we move closer to first pitch.\n\nAlso Consider: Patrick Corbin, Adam Wainwright\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nJustin Smoak - Toronto (vs. Baltimore)\n\nToronto checks in with the highest run-scoring projection of this tidy five-game slate, and that\u2019s not surprising when considering the favorable draw against Baltimore\u2019s pitching staff. Chandler Shepherd will take the bump for the Orioles (5.21 xFIP), and their bullpen is probably ready for the season to be over. Smoak is a powerful switch-hitter who has slapped two homers over his past four outings.\n\nAlso Consider: Pete Alonso, Ji-Man Choi\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nCavan Biggio - Toronto (vs. Baltimore)\n\nStory continues\n\nLet\u2019s keep it going with the Jays, as Biggio makes a strong case for one of the top five hitters in this slate. The fact that he\u2019s listed as a second baseman, where there\u2019s low opportunity cost, makes him an easy lift for cash games. Biggio has been very good through the month of September (16 games, .328 avg, 15 runs, 3 HRs, 11 RBIs, 4 SB), and he should be able to keep it going in this series vs. Baltimore.\n\nAlso Consider: Brandon Lowe, Hanser Alberto\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nTommy Edman - St. Louis (at Arizona)\n\nSpeaking of rookies who have been raking, Edman has piled up six multi-hit performances with three homers, 10 runs, and three steals over his last 10 starts. His salary is still relatively tame despite that, and the St. Louis switch-hitter will have a chance to keep his momentum against mediocre Arizona LHP Alex Young.\n\nAlso consider: Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Joey Wendle\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nJonathan Villar - Baltimore (at Toronto)\n\nWhile a Toronto offensive stack seems like a great idea, don\u2019t forget about the bats from the other dugout. Toronto RHP Clay Buchholz has been miserable over his last two starts, coughing up 11 earned runs and 17 hits through 7.2 innings. That includes a line of 3.2 IP, 10 hits, 7 ER last Wednesday against the same Baltimore team he\u2019ll see tonight. Villar is one of my favorite candidates to make some fantasy noise, as he\u2019s a switch-hitter who can rack up points via contact, power, and speed.\n\nAlso Consider: Paul DeJong, Amed Rosario\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nAnthony Santander - Baltimore (at Toronto)\n\nTake the previous write-up and directly apply it to Santander, who is another Baltimore switch-hitter. Santander has impressed in stretches this season, and he\u2019s currently in one of those grooves with two homers and six RBIs over his past four games. In a game that should see plenty of runs from both sides, I\u2019m expecting Santander to get in on the action.\n\nAdam Eaton - Washington (vs. Philadelphia)\n\nWe can\u2019t forget about Washington in a home date with Philadelphia RHP Zach Eflin. Even though Eflin has looked decent over his past two starts, he still carries a vulnerable .353 wOBA split to left-handed bats. Juan Soto is the leading Nationals\u2019 candidate to jump all over that, but he\u2019s very expensive on DFS sites. Eaton checks in with a much friendlier price tag with the ability to connect for multiple hits and runs in this draw.\n\nAlso consider: Juan Soto, Austin Meadows, Lourdes Gurriel Jr., Randal Grichuk, Austin Hays, JD Davis", "description": "Spencer Limbach finds the best MLB DFS Plays at every position for Monday, September 23.
