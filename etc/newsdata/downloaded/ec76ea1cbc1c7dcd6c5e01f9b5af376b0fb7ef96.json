Swedish giant IKEA late last year deployed him for a range of gardening products and tools to encourage city-dwellers to grow food locally. Then in May, IKEA released a Tom Dixon line of furniture accompanied by a line-up of \u201cauthorised hacks\u201d to incite consumers to customise his designs.\n\nWhen Virgin Voyages\u2019 Scarlet Lady cruise ship sets sail next year, the latest addition to Richard Branson\u2019s arsenal, it will feature 78 RockStar suites designed by Dixon in eight variations including Massive, Fab and Posh configurations.\n\nTom Dixon didn\u2019t want to be a designer because in the early 1980s he was happy playing bass in what he now calls \u201cpunky, funky disco band\u201d, Funkapolitan. In their Top of the Pops performance of the 1981 dancefloor hit As The Time Goes By, a floppy-fringed Dixon shuffles about looking askance, slightly bored; an affectation he retains to this day.\n\nBack then, he was also running a nightclub in Kings Cross, working in an animation studio in Soho, restoring classic cars and welding in a friend\u2019s garage in Vauxhall \u2013 at the time three gritty neighbourhoods, all gentrified today.\n\nTom Dixon: \"The idea of making and selling was never separate in my mind in the way it is for people who studied design.\"\n\n\u201cI became kind of captivated by welding,\u201d Dixon recalls, seated in his Kings Cross studio in a newly vibrant design district a few weeks before the House of Commons ceremony.\n\n\u201cWelding allows you to make a wide variety of things very quickly but with relatively sturdy outcomes. You\u2019re able to realise your ideas yourself, and all of a sudden it\u2019s a lamp, it\u2019s a chair, it\u2019s a table.\u201d\n\nThose early pieces were of a style perhaps best described as \u201csteampunk postmodern\u201d. Dixon welded the precursor to the S Chair from steel sheeting and wrapped the sinuous frame in black gaffer tape. (\u201cIt was a bad idea and ended up as a spectacularly ugly object,\u201d he admits.)\n\nHis Plumbing Chair of 1989 was just that \u2013 a seat constructed entirely of copper piping and elbow joints scavenged from loose-parts bins at builders\u2019 suppliers. He sold a set of six to shoe designer Patrick Cox, only to have them fall apart during a dinner party. The prototype S Chair went to a hairdressing salon in Soho. \u201cFor some reason hairdressers always liked my work,\u201d says Dixon. \u201cThey were early adopters.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTom\u2019s a polymath,\u201d says Ben Evans, director of the London Design Festival and the man who negotiated for the awards dinner to be hosted in the House of Commons dining room. When asked how one books Parliament for an awards night, Evans responds: \u201cConnections\u201d. As the son of politician Baroness Tessa Vosper Blackstone and a recipient of a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for services to the creative industries, connections is something he surely has.\n\nEvans recalls meeting Dixon at club nights and warehouse parties in the 1980s. \u201cWhich, in those days, meant you literally broke into a warehouse and threw an illegal party,\u201d he points out. \u201cThe scene was very small then and involved people from all different worlds coming together, so we all got to know one another.\u201d\n\nTom Dixon's Coal Office furniture shop has a collection of old and new, including the S\u2011Chair, Pylon Chair and Bird Chaise, lined up beyond the table.\n\nTogether with his associate Sir John Sorrell, Evans founded the London Design Festival in 2003 as an umbrella organisation to unite the city\u2019s design districts, which now number 11 and stretch from gritty Shoreditch to very polished Brompton via Clerkenwell, Bankside and Pimlico.\n\nThey inaugurated the Design Medal program in 2007, the year it was awarded to architect Zaha Hadid, and it has since honoured talents as varied as fashion designer Paul Smith, hairstylist Vidal Sassoon and industrial designer Marc Newson.\n\nAs a policy adviser to Tony Blair when he was prime minister, Evans was responsible for the creative industries being recognised as an economic sector. The London Design Festival, then, is much more than a celebration: it\u2019s a marketing and communications operation aimed at promoting an economy which, according to Evans, employs one in six people in the UK.\n\n\u201cThe location of the awards ceremony is a sleepless night task,\u201d says Evans. \u201cWe\u2019re determined to find ever more ambitious places that speak to the very specific design credentials of London.\u201d\n\nPrevious venues have included St Paul\u2019s Cathedral and Lancaster House, the former home of the Duke of York and Albany, which is so grand it stands in for Buckingham Palace in Netflix series, The Crown.\n\nThe choice of Westminster wasn\u2019t just opportune, it was inspired: for all its evident gestural complexity, the building, and everything in it, is the expression of a very pure architectural intent. Following the destruction by fire of the old palace in 1834, architect Charles Barry was engaged to design the new Houses of Parliament, assisted by Augustus Pugin who is responsible for the Gothic Revival interiors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn all, Pugin designed more than 1000 interior elements, from the enormous stained glass windows to the deeply coffered timber ceilings, ornate blood-red wallpapers and intricate brass doorknobs. He even designed ceramics and glassware especially for the House.\n\n\u201cThe House of Commons is a complete design entity,\u201d says Evans. \u201cPugin came up with a distinctive aesthetic for our number-one building based on a very particular idea of Englishness.\u201d\n\nLike Pugin, Dixon incarnates a particular sense of Englishness, a complete design entity \u2013 though his style is more groovy than gothic.\n\nIf you\u2019ve noticed a revival of spun copper lighting and table accessories, you can thank Dixon. Detected an uptake in globular glass light fittings? That\u2019s Dixon. (You can dine beneath his overblown Melt pendants at the Bennelong restaurant in the city-facing shell of the Sydney Opera House.) Swirl bookends made from marble residue mixed with pigment, Fat noodle-like armchairs, Bump glass teacups at \u00a385 ($155) a pair? All Dixon (beware of the very many imitations, however).\n\nDixon\u2019s HQ since mid-2018 is in a handsome 1850s brick building situated on Regents Canal as it approaches Kings Cross station. A former coal distribution centre, the three-storey structure with its sprawling dependencies and seven vaulted archways houses Dixon\u2019s product design studio, interior design studio, global logistics centre and retail outlets.\n\nThe Coal Office restaurant showcases Dixon's products.\n\nThere\u2019s also a restaurant, called Coal Office, helmed by acclaimed Israeli chef Assaf Granit, who is popularly known as Buffalo. Eating there is a total immersion in Dixon\u2019s world since it is totally kitted out with his product.\n\nThe retail offering, grouped by category and displayed within the interlinked archways, goes from big-ticket items such as sofas and chandeliers to razors, chopping boards and room scents.\n\nIn fact, Tom Dixon is more than a designer: he\u2019s a brand, the purveyor of a total lifestyle. His name is his logo, spelt out in a chunky font punctuated by a prominent full-stop \u2013 the last word in contemporary chic.\n\nCollectively know as the Coal Office, the complex anchors the new Coal Drops Yard development with its landmark brick \u201ckissing\u201d building by Thomas Heatherwick, a 5000-student annexe of arts and design college Central Saint Martins, as well as the UK headquarters of Facebook, United Artists and soon Google, which has commissioned a new building designed by Heatherwick in partnership with Danish architect Bjarke Ingels of BIG.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen that \u00a31 billion \u201clandscraper\u201d (so named because it occupies horizontally the space a skyscraper would vertically) finally opens and the 4000 employees move in, it will cement London\u2019s reputation as the creative capital of Europe. Still, even given the high-octane talent pool in the precinct, \u201cDixon is the flagship tenant,\u201d reckons Evans.\n\nThe Coal Office is the hub for Tom Dixon\u2019s design studios, retail outlet and restaurant.\n\nDixon calls Coal Drops Yard a proper hub. \u201cThere are six tube lines and [big overland rail stations] Euston, St Pancras and Kings Cross are all adjacent. So we\u2019re connected to Europe via Eurostar as well as to all of London and regional Britain.\n\n\"It\u2019s a very networked precinct. And there\u2019s an incredible mix of tenants, from small retailers to creative schools, to big tech companies, so it\u2019s good for networking beyond just transport.\u201d\n\nThe designer was an experiential retailer before that was even a thing, and bricks-and-mortar is an opportunity to turn shopping into an event. For the London Design Festival he curated a week-long happening called Touchy Smelly Feely Noisy Tasty, which ran the gamut of sensual experiences.\n\nIt went from a razor bar with customisable shaving devices (feely) and bespoke salon versions of his iconic Bird recliner (touchy) to a champagne terrace and carrot degustation station (tasty), and two new fragrances called Underground and Alchemy (smelly).\n\nThe noisy component was a series of talks facilitated by Swedish synthesiser company Teenage Engineering, which created a totemic sculpture from its state-of-the-art speakers.\n\nFor the opening party, the speaker installation turned into a nightclub which some 1400 invited guests attended. Those who completed the full Touchy Feely course and got their program stamped at each station were rewarded with a limited-edition Tom Dixon tote bag. Highly collectible, over the years these have become something of a badge of honour for the design insider.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to sweat your assets,\u201d says Dixon. \u201cReal estate in city centres has to be multiple use. You need to make something that\u2019s open early for breakfast and closes at midnight after dinner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In my dreams I\u2019d also be running a 24-hour service centre here, for customers in Australia or deliveries to China. And then suddenly it becomes a cheap building because you\u2019re doing three shifts. It\u2019s no longer effective to just have a shop.\u201d\n\nTom Dixon was born in Sfax, the second city of Tunisia, in 1959, to an English father and a French-Latvian mother. When he was four the family moved to northern England, but by high school he was in London and enrolled at Holland Park comprehensive, renowned as an experimental school in a rough end of town.\n\n\u201cKids were going wild and there wasn\u2019t a great deal of teaching,\u201d recalls Dixon, \u201cbut there was a fantastic art department and that\u2019s where I took refuge.\u201d\n\nHe graduated with only one A-Level, in pottery. \u201cThat was my first encounter with shape making, and being able to move a shitty piece of mud into a pot of some value is probably still the kind of alchemy that I\u2019m interested in.\n\n\u201cYou can have an idea and turn a piece of matter into something valuable just with an idea.\u201d\n\nI like putting myself in vaguely uncomfortable situations. It\u2019s not scary once you\u2019ve done it a few times. It\u2019s more scary to be static. \u2014 Tom Dixon\n\nHe enrolled at the Chelsea School of Art, until six months in he broke his leg in a motorbike accident and took it as a sign to quit. \u201cI didn\u2019t like it anyway,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI wanted a real job.\u201d He worked in a print shop, did a stint in an animation studio (\u201ccolouring-in boring ads, it wasn\u2019t Disney\u201d), began playing music in his spare time.\n\nThat segued into a gig as bass guitarist in dance band Funkapolitan. They signed a record deal and were successful enough to support Simple Minds, The Clash and Ziggy Marley. When he broke an arm in a second motorbike accident, the band left him behind when it went on tour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut in the meantime I\u2019d started club nights, kind of illegal warehouse parties that we moved to a regular venue that we rented for a couple of years.\n\n\"It was very entrepreneurial, the music experience and the club experience were all mini-businesses where your own creativity could convert very quickly into a living.\n\n\"You learn your own instrument, you write your own tunes, you do your own record cover, you do your own posters, you go get your own gigs, and you make a living from it.\u201d\n\nDixon's range is displayed under archways in the Coal Office retail outlet.\n\nDixon\u2019s entrepreneurial nature meant that his first forays into furniture design happened organically. He\u2019d begun welding as a hobby, \u201cmaking things for fun\u201d, but soon enough club contacts \u2013 all those hairdressers and fashion designers and musicians \u2013 began to buy the stuff.\n\n\u201cSo the idea of making and selling was never separate in my mind in the way it is for people who studied design,\u201d says Dixon. \u201cOr, rather, the inspirational nature of somebody actually getting their wallet out and paying you money for something that you\u2019ve just conceived of, or made the week before, is something that\u2019s never left me.\n\n\u201cI think for a lot of designers the commercial act seems like prostitution. It\u2019s not the thing they\u2019re interested in. But for me it is the thing. If you can\u2019t sell the thing, that means nobody likes it and it has no value.\u201d\n\nWith outlets for his products in 68 countries and a burgeoning interior design business, it\u2019s safe to say Tom Dixon is widely liked and highly valued.\n\nHis secret? Stay agile, keep learning, constantly reinvent the narrative as much as the products themselves. \u201cI like putting myself in vaguely uncomfortable situations,\u201d he says. \u201cIt rejuvenates me. It\u2019s not scary once you\u2019ve done it a few times. It\u2019s more scary to be static.\u201d\n\nAs he put it while accepting his accolade at the House of Commons: \u201cI should have received the Emerging Designer award since I always feel like a beginner.\u201d\n\nThe November issue of AFR Magazine, including the Young Rich List, is out on Friday, October 25 inside The Australian Financial Review.
