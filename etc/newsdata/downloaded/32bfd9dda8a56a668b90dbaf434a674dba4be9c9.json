The only thing he\u2019s worried about is that some new figure comes out of nowhere, and I\u2019m that figure.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe runs most effectively against people that are part of the D.C. establishment, and I am not,\u201d Mr. Yang said.\n\nThe entrepreneur pointed out that he is one of the only candidates Mr. Trump hasn\u2019t targeted on Twitter.\n\n\u201cAnd the reason for that is that he\u2019s a bully, and he knows I\u2019m better at the internet than he is,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of the people online that create memes and whatnot have converted to the \u2018Yang Gang.\u2019 So he hasn\u2019t touched me because he knows I\u2019m not the candidate he wants to mess with.\u201d\n\nMr. Yang said that \u201chumor is the best antidote,\u201d because simply calling Mr. Trump\u2019s actions divisive isn\u2019t terribly effective.\n\n\u201cSo the nickname that we\u2019ve come up with, that we think he will use for me, is \u2018Comrade Yang,\u2019 because it\u2019s a little racist \u2014 it makes me seem like a communist or something like that,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Mr. Yang said his idea to give every American a $1,000-per-month stipend \u201cis simply capitalism where income doesn\u2019t start at zero.\u201d\n\nConsidered an afterthought by some pundits months ago, Mr. Yang is now in sixth place in the latest Real Clear Politics average of public polling on the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
