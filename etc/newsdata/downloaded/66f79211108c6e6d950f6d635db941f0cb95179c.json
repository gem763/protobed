They're literally paying a paedophile to use his music in a movie about the consequences of child abuse,\" writes one Twitter user. \"I'm off the fence \u2014 this movie is immoral bulls--t.\"\n\nGary Glitter gets royalties for Joker. They're literally paying a paedophile to use his music in a movie about the consequences of child abuse. I'm off the fence - this movie is immoral bullshit. \u2014@ManVsPink\n\n\"I would NEVER normally advocate this. However, if you are planning on seeing #Joker this weekend please pirate or torrent it,\" writes another. \"F--k the profits of ANY movie that \u2022knowingly\u2022 lines the pockets of a paedophile scumbag like #GaryGlitter!\"\n\n\"Not sure if Americans have been following this. But the Joker stairs dancing sequence lasts for barely 2 min (if that) and because of the song choice, prolific pedophile Gary Glitter will be making thousands in royalties,\" writes another.\n\nOh. Not sure if Americans have been following this. But the Joker stairs dancing sequence lasts for barely 2 min (if that) and because of the song choice, prolific pedophile Gary Glitter will be making thousands in royalties<a href=\"https://t.co/nMqDf6EYEZ\">https://t.co/nMqDf6EYEZ</a><br><br>We live in a society! <a href=\"https://t.co/yNvjZNXt9q\">pic.twitter.com/yNvjZNXt9q</a> \u2014@broderick\n\nStill another argued the choice was deliberate and juvenile.\n\nI\u2019m of two minds about this, to be frank. On one level, the film\u2019s provocations are deliberately juvenile, bordering in on trollish.<br><br>In actuality, the most morally questionable aspect of the film is the use of a Gary Glitter song, and the film is well aware of this. <a href=\"https://t.co/h25dHrc4js\">pic.twitter.com/h25dHrc4js</a> \u2014@Darren_Mooney\n\nOthers are boycotting the film specifically because of the song.\n\nSo I was gonna watch the joker but I discovered today they have used a Gary Glitter song of which he will receive revenue. If you are unaware who that is but have a conscience I\u2019d suggest you google him before you decide to go the cinema. \u2014@CaptainEvasion\n\nAnother user had a different solution.\n\nFixed! Now convicted pedophile Gary Glitter won't receive any royalties! But Smash Mouth will! Win-win! <a href=\"https://t.co/OmLBF2Pfoa\">pic.twitter.com/OmLBF2Pfoa</a> \u2014@leoadriangarcia\n\nThe glam rocker, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was known for his outlandish suits, boots and makeup, and he sold more than 20 million records.

After his second conviction, the NFL requested that teams stop playing the song.\n\nIn 2014 Gadd was charged In the U.K. with sexual offences dating back decades, among them rape and indecent assault. On Feb. 25, 2015, he was sentenced to 16 years in prison.\n\nOn its opening weekend, the R-rated film Joker raked in $93.5 million in the United States alone, which marks the most lucrative debut in history for any film released in October.
