REUTERS/Samir Bol\n\nThe two men signed a pact a year ago to end a civil war that has killed hundreds of thousands of people, displaced a third of the population and wrecked the economy. Machar made a rare visit to Juba this week to meet Kiir.\n\n\u201cThe parties discussed minor issues and the principals agreed to establish transitional government by 12th November,\u201d Michael Makuei Lueth, the information minister, told reporters.\n\nLast year\u2019s accord, which called for a unity government, has been delayed because the government says it does not have enough money to fund disarmament and the integration of all the armed factions.\n\nThis week\u2019s meetings between the two leaders were aimed at ironing out outstanding issues, officials said.\n\nThey discussed constitutional amendments, security laws and the number of regional states that the country should have, the government officials added.\n\nSouth Sudan aims to hold elections after a transition period of three years.\n\nBoth Kiir and Machar said their talks went well, without providing details. Machar said he will visit Juba more often.\n\n\u201cThere will be frequent meetings,\u201d he said, standing next to Kiir.\n\nSouth Sudan split away from Sudan in 2011 after decades of war but plunged into its own conflict at the end of 2013 after Kiir sacked Machar as vice president.\n\nTroops loyal to both men clashed in the capital that December and ethnically charged fighting soon spread.\n\nBoth sides signed a peace deal in September 2018, under pressure from international and regional powers. Machar who lives in Khartoum, has since returned to Juba just once, in October that year, to celebrate the peace deal.\n\nA key provision of the peace deal is integration of former rebels in the army, which has still not occurred.", "description": "South Sudan's President Salva Kiir and rebel leader Riek Machar have agreed to form a transitional government by the middle of November, the information minister said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Denis Dumo", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428668572&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A0VY", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
