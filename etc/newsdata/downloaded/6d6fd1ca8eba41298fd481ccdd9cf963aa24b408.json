Tokarczuk was awarded for \"a narrative imagination\" that \"represents the crossing of boundaries as a form of life\".\n\nThe 2017 literature prize went to British novelist Kazuo Ishiguro and the 2016 prize went to Bob Dylan for his song lyrics.\n\nThe literature prize has so far only been awarded to only 14 women. The prize has only been shared between two individuals four times.\n\nEarlier in the week, the Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine, Physics and Chemistry were awarded. The highly-anticipated Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded on Friday.", "description": "The Nobel Prize in Literature is going to be awarded to two laureates in 2019.", "authors": ["Lauren Chadwick"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/22/20/54/1000x563_cmsv2_f0d7cfc3-a5c8-5c57-9307-66986ee05e3f-4222054.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
