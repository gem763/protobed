And people like to know stuff, so what the fuck are you?\n\n\u201cI just think we\u2019re all kind of getting to a place where \u2013 I don\u2019t know, evolution\u2019s a weird thing \u2013 we\u2019re all becoming incredibly ambiguous \u2026 And it\u2019s this really gorgeous thing.\u201d\n\nStewart had high-profile relationships with fellow Twilight actor Robert Pattinson and Snow White and the Huntsman director Rupert Sanders before revealing in 2015 a relationship with visual effects producer Alicia Cargile.
