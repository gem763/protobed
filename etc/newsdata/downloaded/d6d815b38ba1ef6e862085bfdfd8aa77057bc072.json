So, the NBA position is that it is in favor of freedom of speech provided that no one speaks.\n\nIn contrast, the creators of \u201cSouth Park\u201d wrote the following letter of apology to the leaders of the Chinese communist government. \u201cLike the NBA, we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts. We too love money more than freedom and democracy. Xi doesn\u2019t look like Winnie the Pooh at all. Tune into our 300th episode this Wednesday at 10! Long live the Great Communist Party of China! May this autumn\u2019s sorghum harvest be bountiful! We good now China?\u201d\n\nThe \u201cSouth Park\u201d response was a brilliant piece of political satire, perhaps read or heard by hundreds of millions if not billions. In a short paragraph, it reminds us all of the true nature of the tyrannical Chinese communist state.\n\nIt is easy to imagine how the major players in the American Revolution would react, if alive today. Benedict Arnold might well own an NBA team and be rich but despised by his countrymen and an embarrassment to his future generations. Thomas Paine might earn a living by writing for \u201cSouth Park,\u201d while railing against the liberty-hating creeps who advocate bigger government.\n\nRonald Reagan was a genuinely funny man who understood the power of humor. He collected jokes that were being told by those under communist tyranny in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and understood when to tell which joke for the maximum effect. When Mikhail Gorbachev came to Washington to visit him, the Soviet Union and the communist government had already lost much of whatever legitimacy they might have had.\n\nSo, Reagan gave it another gentle push as it headed over the cliff, by telling Mr. Gorbachev the joke about the fellow who had just purchased a new Russian car but was informed that it would not be delivered for another 10 years. With that, the car buyer asked whether the delivery would be in the morning or afternoon. The salesman looked puzzled and said, \u201cWhat difference does it make?\u201d The car buyer replied, \u201cThe plumber is coming in the morning.\u201d Mr. Gorbachev laughed because he well understood that the people\u2019s paradise was not capable of delivering the goods. (Leonid Brezhnev and Josef Stalin would likely have reacted much differently.)\n\nA Russian variation of the same joke: \u201cDad, can I have the car keys?\u201d / \u201cOK, but don\u2019t lose them. We will get the car in only seven years!\u201d\n\nTo maintain their sanity, people in the Soviet Union had endless variations of the shortage of goods jokes. \u201cA fellow walks into a meat store and asks for fish. The clerk says, we are a meat store, but we have no meat. The fish store is across the street, but they have no fish.\u201d\n\nMany modern comedians have forgotten that some of the most effective political jokes are non-partisan but have an element of truth that all can understand. A mid-1990s joke had President Bill Clinton, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and Vice President Dan Quayle riding in a car in Kansas. A tornado suddenly appears and hurls the car into the magical Land of Oz. Mr. Gingrich says, \u201cWell I\u2019m off to see the Wizard and get myself a heart.\u201dMr. Quayle adds, \u201cI\u2019ll go with you and get a brain.\u201d And a leering Mr. Clinton asks, \u201cWhere is Dorothy?\u201d\n\nPolitical jokes can disarm an opponent. Reagan was the master of this, and often made himself the object of the joke. During the 1984 re-election campaign, a number of Democrats were arguing that Reagan was too old for a second term. (The country was enjoying peace and prosperity, so the Democratic debate point options were limited.) During a debate with his opponent Walter Mondale \u2014 a nice man who managed to win only one state against Reagan \u2014 Reagan said that \u201che was not going to make an issue of his opponent\u2019s youth and inexperience.\u201d The age issue almost disappeared after that quip.\n\nA quip or even one funny word can be used to permanently undermine an opponent\u2019s credibility. Donald Trump calling Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas\u201d (perhaps the fairest skinned of all senators) forever will remind voters of her tall tale about being a Cherokee Indian and her family suffering discrimination as a result.\n\nReagan managed to defeat his domestic political opponents and win the Cold War, without firing a shot, partly through his adroit use of the right joke and quip at the right time. Mr. Trump is capable of being a very funny man (as he shows in his rallies), but unlike Reagan, he also has an occasional nasty streak. Among the other world leaders (a particularly dull group), the U.K.\u2019s Boris Johnson shows some potential for humor, and surprisingly Vladimir Putin has a funny side, as when he mocks alleged Russian interference with other countries\u2019 elections. The curse of our time is that much of the political and media establishment are humorless boors who take themselves far too seriously.\n\n\u2022 Richard W.
