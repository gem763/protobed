House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called the president over the weekend, and in the 11-minute phone call, the duo pushed a House bill that mandates universal background checks, something Republicans have opposed.\n\nManchin, Toomey, and Murphy - along with their staffs - have spent hours in talks with the White House over the past several months designed to craft legislation that could garner Trump's signature. Toomey quipped recently that he spent his month-long August recess singularly focused on this topic.\n\n\u201cWhy is this one guy bringing this up right now?\" Manchin bristled, saying that the Department of Justice has concerns about the app, as well. \"Why is this one guy adamantly wanting one thing done which makes no sense right now?\u201d\n\nTom Williams/CQ Roll Call via AP\n\nManchin, a moderate and sometimes Trump ally, said he told the White House he is happy to fund a year-long study of the app, but he said there are just too many questions and not enough time to figure it out.\n\n\u201cThrowing in something like a new app for how you\u2019re going to do a background check? Okay, maybe, I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s not worth saying we\u2019ve got to do this right now, because you\u2019re saying something\u2019s broke. [The background check system] is not broke,\" Manchin said, adding, \"I\u2019m concerned, and DOJ\u2019s concerned about how it would impede their investigations.\u201d\n\nAt the White House meeting at which Williams presented the app idea, Manchin said he and the former NRA staffer got into it, with the senator saying Williams \u201cgot very vocal, and I got very vocal.\u201d\n\nThe White House has not responded to ABC News' request for comment.\n\nAs Washington awaits a presidential decision, and all sides of the debate lobby Trump, Democrats, and some Republicans like Toomey, are trying to keep up pressure for expanding background checks. This as a recent ABC News poll found overwhelming support - 89 percent of Americans - for expanding background checks on all commercial sales, including gun shows and private sales. Sens. Manchin, Toomey, and Murphy have been pressing the President to embrace their legislation that does just that.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Sen. Murphy will lead more than 20 of his Democratic colleagues in speeches highlighting the impact of gun violence.", "description": "West Virginia Democrat Sen.
