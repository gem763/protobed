A first prize of $10 million -- three times as much as for Europe's richest race the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe -- is likely to grab plenty of attention in the racing world.\n\nThe question is: where will it all end?\n\nJUST WATCHED Hanboks and jeon: The food and fashion of racing in Korea Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\n\n'One of the great meetings'\n\nAccording to Alastair Donald, of global race promoter the International Racing Bureau, the Saudi Cup is not just a brazen attempt to be biggest and best.\n\nHe draws parallels with the Dubai World Cup, which was devised by Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum in 1996.\n\n\"I don't think being the richest was the aim,\" said Donald of the Saudi Cup.\n\n\"It was just like Sheikh Mohammed's aim to create something that was special at the time in terms of being worth a lot of money. That was just part of the plan to put Dubai on the map as a racing nation and as somewhere that was going to become a holiday destination.\n\n\"I think it was successful and has stood the test of time - it's still one of the great meetings.\"\n\nHe added: \"This is headline-grabbing stuff and it's more about making a statement about Saudi Arabia to announce itself to the racing world and create something that's a statement of intent.\"\n\nAfter two chart-topping years, Pegasus organizers split the cash across the original dirt race and a new turf race to attract more international talent.\n\n\"It's just about evolving,\" Tim Rivto, COO of organizer The Stronach Group, told CNN Sport. \"I think when we look back in 20 years, it's going to look very different from what it looked like in the beginning.\"\n\nPhotos: 10 of the most picturesque racecourses Meydan Racecourse, Dubai \u2013 Boasting the world's first five-star trackside hotel, restaurants and a museum, Dubai's Meydan Racecourse is a first-class racing destination.

This will bring more Saudi owners into the game adding to the current markets.\"\n\nArrogate won the inaugural Pegasus World Cup at Gulfstream Park in 2017.\n\n'Headline-grabbing stuff'\n\nSport is playing an increasing role in Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plans to modernize the country and to garner some positive publicity worldwide, in the wake of the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi . Saudi's human rights record and treatment of women is also highly controversial.\n\nFemale jockeys and trainers will be \"most welcome\" at the Saudi Cup, Prince Bandar told guests at a lavish launch in London.\n\nDonald is confident that the Saudi Cup is here to stay as the world's richest race for the foreseeable future, with no current other race suitor lurking with bottomless pockets.\n\n\"I don't think that many places are in a position to stage the richest race,\" he added.\n\n\"The proof will be in the pudding and only time will tell. I don't think others will push the envelope for now. I certainly don't think we're going to get into a competition of one country trying to outdo another. I don't think this will, for example, act as a spur for Sheikh Mohammed.\n\n\"The races aren't in competition with one another. We're always trying to open into new markets and this is one.\"\n\nThe inaugural Saudi Cup will take place at the King Abdulaziz Racetrack in Riyadh on February 29 on dirt over nine furlongs.", "description": "Horse racing's financial arms race is in full swing as a new event takes winnings to an eye-watering $20 million.", "authors": ["Matt Majendie", "For Cnn"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190918133616-saudi-cup-tease-racegoer-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
