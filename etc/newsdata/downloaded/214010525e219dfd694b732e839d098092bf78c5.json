It\u2019s losing millions of dollars a day. It may be shut out of the public stock and bond markets to raise new money.\n\nThat\u2019s the grim situation confronting the office-sharing company days after a corporate upheaval that left its once-glittering plans shattered. Adam Neumann, who founded the company nine years ago with a promise to change the world, was ousted as CEO. WeWork\u2019s initial public offering, intended to raise urgently needed financing, was called off, until at least next year. And that, in turn, unraveled a $6 billion financing package.\n\nSo now the two new co-CEOs named to replace Neumann -- Sebastian Gunningham and Artie Minson -- need to quickly figure out a way forward for a company that was once one of the world\u2019s most valuable startups but has never made a penny in profit. That likely means seeking substantial new bank loans and private investments. It also may mean shedding thousands of jobs and tossing out Neumann\u2019s grow-at-all-costs ambitions.\n\nThe first task: WeWork is in talks with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. about a new $3 billion loan. But there\u2019s a catch: Any such deal would also require the company to raise new equity. That could mean Gunningham and Minson returning hat in hand to its biggest investor -- SoftBank Group Corp., the Japanese company that has already pumped in more than $10 billion.\n\nGetting new financing is critical. The company lost $690 million in the first six months and it burns through cash. Even with $2.5 billion in cash as of June 30, the company could run out of money by mid-2020, analysts have said.\n\nSuch numbers could spell the end to Neumann\u2019s profit-less growth ethos. When Fitch Ratings downgraded the company\u2019s debt in August, it said the company had made a choice to prioritize growth over profitability by planning for more than 1.25 million new desks -- more than twice what\u2019s currently available -- and plans to open in 175 new cities globally.\n\nFor next year alone WeWork, or We Co. as it was renamed, had planned to add 725,000 new desks at a cost of about $4.5 billion, S&P Global Ratings has estimated.\n\nBusiness Model\n\nEven WeWork\u2019s basic business model could be at stake. WeWork has raised more than $12 billion to rent office space that it renovates and then leases to companies. But that strategy has left it in a precarious position. It has some $47 billion of future rent payments due. On average it leases its buildings for 15 years. Yet its tenants are committed to paying only $4 billion, and on average have leases for 15 months.\n\nThose long-term leases \u201cmay become an albatross in an economic downturn,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jeffrey Langbaum wrote in a report Wednesday, adding that WeWork needs to find a \u201cclear path to profitability.\u201d\n\nA WeWork representative didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOne immediate task for the new executives is to reduce costs drastically and slow the cash burn that\u2019s worried investors. They are weighing job cuts that could number in the thousands -- the company currently employs about 12,000 people -- and eliminating or spinning out non-core businesses, such as WeGrow, an experimental New York City private school, a person with knowledge of the matter said earlier.\n\nDeep cuts could free up meaningful resources: the company spent $184 million on payroll last year, and another $23 million in stock compensation.\n\nWeWork has long maintained that it could become a profitable company if it decided to cut its growth ambitions. The new co-CEOs have warned employees in an email that they \u201canticipate difficult decisions ahead\u201d to protect WeWork\u2019s \u201clong-term interests and health.\u201d\n\nWeWork could try tapping the high-yield bond market again. But credit investors would demand a steep price. WeWork\u2019s existing high-yield bonds yield about 9.8%, far above the average for junk bonds, which sit around 5.7%. On Wednesday, they were trading at the lowest prices since June.\n\nWith revenue of more than $3 billion in the first six months of this year, WeWork in theory shouldn\u2019t have difficulty making interest payments on its bonds. That debt isn\u2019t due until 2025, though the company will make more than $52 million in annual payments on the notes.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- WeWork has only enough cash to last to maybe next spring.
