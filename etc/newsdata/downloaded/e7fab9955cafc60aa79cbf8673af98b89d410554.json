One such individual is Brianne West, founder and CEO of Ethique, a zero-waste beauty brand determined to change the way beauty products are manufactured and eliminate the use of plastic packaging in the process. Ethique emerged in 2012 from a competition for young entrepreneurs at the University of Canterbury where West was studying marine biology. She credits this experience with giving her the grounding necessary to turn her idea into a reality.\n\n\u201cWe were given a business mentor and they coached us through writing a business plan (which was a new experience for me) and helping prepare a pitch for the judging panel. We didn\u2019t win the competition, but we are the only ones still standing,\u201d she says. That early mentor is now West\u2019s business partner and together they are on a mission to not just make a dent in the 80 million plastic shampoo and conditioner bottles thrown away every year, they want to show the world that financial success is not incompatible with ethical integrity.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe concept is relatively straightforward \u2013 create shampoos and conditioners in bar form eliminating the plastic and the water that traditional products use. Which is innovative in itself but the commitment to ethics goes much deeper in this business. \u201cThe original idea was to rid the world of plastic bottles but now the focus is on becoming world\u2019s most sustainable cosmetics company,\u201d explains West.\n\nEthique uses only biodegradable ingredients and compostable packaging, uses only plant-based and vegan ingredients in its products, rejects any form of animal testing and ensures everyone involved in the process is paid a living wage. And in a direct challenge to Friedman\u2019s belief that business is purely about generating profit, Ethique donates 20% of its profits every year to environmental projects and charities. \u201cAll of these things have been in place from the very beginning,\u201d West explains.\n\n\u201cPeople have tried to talk me out of the profit donation, but well-run businesses make a lot of money and shareholders don\u2019t need hundreds of millions of dollars. It is a little unfair and it is our way of making it a little fairer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very idealistic,\u201d she admits and points out that she has surrounded herself with \u201cvery astute people and experienced advisors\u201d to ensure that what she describes as a certain naivety doesn\u2019t compromise the business\u2019 potential.\n\nWith dreams of creating a billion-dollar turnover business (current revenues are in the tens of millions on the back of 300% annual growth), surely at some point, to reach that goal, West and Ethique will have to make some concessions to cold, hard business reality at the expense of ethics? \u201cWe have never had to compromise any of our sustainability principles,\u201d she insists. \u201cPeople are waking up to the fact that consumers want this kind of product. Before we launched I just hoped that people wanted it. I\u2019m not an unusual person, so I thought if I wanted it, others would too.\u201d\n\nPeople are waking up to the fact that consumers want this kind of product\n\nOne example of this commitment to the ethics that underpin the organisation is the fact that West has refused to pursue the opportunity to trade in China, a potentially huge market, on the basis that regulations in the country insist upon testing beauty products on animals.\n\nThis isn\u2019t West\u2019s first foray into the business world. She has had two previous businesses \u2013 the first was what she describes as \u201can ordinary cosmetics company\u201d set up when she was 18 and starting out at university. This \u201chobby business\u201d was followed by a rather more successful confectionary business selling spoonable fudge. \u201cIt was a cross between fudge and mousse but I couldn\u2019t keep up with demand,\u201d she says.\n\nIt is clear that at her core is an entrepreneurial spirit that thrives on building businesses. Even at the tender age of eight, she set up a pet detective business and managed to succeed in reuniting at least one owner with their lost cat: \u201cThey didn\u2019t pay me though \u2026\u201d\n\nBut her business nous is sharper, and her ambitions much higher today. In the coming year Ethique plans to launch 38 new products, expand its geographic footprint (the first tie-up in the UK is with high street health retailer Holland and Barrett), launch a household cleaning product range, a baby care product line and even a new line of cosmetics. She insists that all will be based on the same ethical principles that have been in place since the start. And it\u2019s clear that while growth is being secured on the back of marketing these ethics, she is having a genuine impact. \u201cThe proudest moments are whenever we calculate how many bottles we have saved. Last week we calculated it was 4.5 million bottles saved and by the end of this year it will be 6 million. We have a goal of 50 million by 2025,\u201d she says.\n\nAnd what is most remarkable about Ethique is that with every bottle saved, every product launched, and every new market exploited, they are showing that shareholders can secure the profits they crave without stripping the planet\u2019s resources in the process. \u201cEnvironmental ethics are good for shareholder value as I am not the only person that thinks like this,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are living proof that this is the way you can run a business.\u201d", "description": "In 1970, the Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman said that the only social responsibility of business \u201cis to use it resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits \u2026\u201d", "authors": ["Martin Friel"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/16/12/brianne-west-ethique-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
