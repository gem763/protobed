Their struggles on a briny bay fouled by petroleum seeps and derelict oil rigs are etched onto their faces and stained into their clothes.\n\nSeeing these people and this place on an earlier reporting trip, veteran Associated Press photographer Rodrigo Abd knew he had to go back. This time, he set down his lightning-fast digital Canon and spread the tripod of his 19th century-style box camera to make black and white portraits of the fishermen and the industrial decay they call home.\n\nThe Argentine-born photographer had turned the lens of his box camera before on subjects in Guatemala, Afghanistan, Mexico and the streets of his home base of Lima, Peru, documenting a spectrum of life\u2019s emotions, from joy to tragedy. He felt the slower pace and mood of box photography would help capture the poignancy and pain of Cabimas, where fisherman live and work among idle, gray machinery.\n\nFishermen get ready to start harvesting crabs in the oil-contaminated Lake Maracaibo near Cabimas, Venezuela.

Women wait in the shade of shacks where they hand-wash shellfish coated in oil. The workday is done when the fishermen unbolt their skiff motors and stow them on the banks for safekeeping.\n\nHaving heard their stories and observed their lives once before, Abd knew he would return, this time lugging along his box camera. \u201cI thought it was a good idea to complete what I already had and to see the same story in a different way, in a more poetic way,\u201d he said.
