That\u2019s an incognito mode for Google Maps that will work just like it does in a web browser, only for navigation and location history. With Incognito enabled in Google Maps, you won\u2019t have to worry about preventing Google from associating certain locations with your Google account, which is something many Maps users will appreciate.\n\nThe new Google Maps feature is part of a bigger push from Google to enhance user privacy. The company announced several new features in a blog post penned by Eric Miraglia, the company\u2019s director of product management, privacy, and data protection.\n\nMore from BGR\n\nThe post explains that incognito mode is already available on Chrome and YouTube, and it\u2019s now coming to Google Maps. The feature is rolling out first to Android, with iPhone coming soon:\n\nWhen you turn on Incognito mode in Maps, your Maps activity on that device, like the places you search for, won\u2019t be saved to your Google Account and won\u2019t be used to personalize your Maps experience. You can easily turn on Incognito mode by selecting it from the menu that appears when you tap your profile photo, and you can turn it off at any time to return to a personalized experience with restaurant recommendations, information about your commute, and other features tailored to you. Incognito mode will start rolling out on Android this month, with iOS coming soon.\n\nAdditionally, Google also announced that it\u2019ll allow users to automatically delete YouTube history, just as they can with Location History and Web & App Activity. Furthermore, the Google Assistant will be able to handle privacy-related commands:\n\nIn the coming weeks, you\u2019ll be able to delete Assistant activity from your Google Account just by saying things like \u201cHey Google, delete the last thing I said to you\u201d or \u201cHey Google, delete everything I said to you last week.\u201d You won\u2019t need to turn on any of these features\u2014they will work automatically when you ask the Assistant for help. If you ask to delete more than a week\u2019s worth of data from your account, the Assistant will point you directly to the page in your account settings to complete the deletion.\n\nFinally, users who rely on Google\u2019s password manager will be informed whether any of the passwords they use have been breached at any time in the past, prompting them to change affected passwords to ensure their accounts are secure.\n\nBGR Top Deals:\n\nTrending Right Now:\n\nSee the original version of this article on BGR.com", "description": "A leak a few days ago revealed that Google was finally testing a Google Maps feature that was announced back at I/O 2019.
