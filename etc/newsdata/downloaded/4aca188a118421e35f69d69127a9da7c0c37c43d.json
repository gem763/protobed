Those things can actually be scary. But grass? Grass isn\u2019t scary, right? Wrong.\n\nIn the Tall Grass, written and directed Vincenzo Natali, is based on a 2012 novella by King and his son, Joe Hill. It\u2019s the story of a brother and sister, Becky (Laysla De Oliveira) and Cal (Avery Whitted) who pull off to the side of the road during a cross country trip and hear a boy\u2019s voice coming from a field. They go into the field to investigate and find themselves trapped.\n\nThe set up is incredibly simple. And yet, from even those very beginning moments, Natali\u2019s filmmaking will give you the creeps. The tall, imposing grass. The dark, wet, disgusting mud. The crackling noises and disparate sounds coming from all across the audio mix. It all adds to a setting that is as basic as basic gets, but still completely unnerving.\n\nAs Becky and Cal first try to find the boy, they soon lose each other, and things get much more complicated from there. There\u2019s the introduction of Becky\u2019s ex-boyfriend Travis (Harrison Gilbertson), the boy whose voice they heard, Tobin (Will Buie Jr.), and Tobin\u2019s parents (Patrick Wilson and Rachel Wilson). The name that stands out there, of course, is Insidious, Conjuring, and Watchmen star Patrick Wilson and it\u2019s his character, Ross, who first encounters Becky and Cal. At first, Ross seems harmless but Wilson wouldn\u2019t be in this movie if he was just a minor character. As the story progresses, Ross continues to gain in prominence until, well, we won\u2019t say.\n\nLaysla De Oliveira plays Becky in In the Tall Grass.

And that constant guessing game of how the grass is being so devious, but also what\u2019s real, what\u2019s not, when is this happening, etc., is thoroughly engaging. Engaging and just plain spooky. In the Tall Grass doesn\u2019t have many jump scares but the whole thing is built to be unsettling, which it excels at. In large part, that\u2019s due to Natali\u2019s abundant use of extreme close-ups, which give drops of water, bugs, and the grass a massive, menacing presence.\n\nAnd while that general tension is prominent for the first half of the film, as things begin to head toward the conclusion, In the Tall Grass pivots into gore. Heads are popped, bodies decay, bones are broken and eyes are stabbed. Plus, shit gets super-duper weird. Like really weird. The tribal chanting that happens out of nowhere is a jarring hint that where the film is going is not going to be easily digested.\n\nThe problem with all of this, though, is that while the interwoven narrative and scares are solid, the characters are never quite as interesting. Natali\u2019s script is filled with backstory for all the main characters but it rarely amounts to more than bland exposition. It\u2019s certainly meant to make the audience feel for them but their environment and plight is much more fascinating and so the characters never measure up.\n\nAs a result, when things really do get their goriest and weirdest, there\u2019s a detachment that keeps the film from being as impactful as it wants to be. The payoffs are good, but they\u2019d be better if the characters were more dynamic.\n\nGilbertson, De Oliveira and Whitted have a complex relationship to say the least. (Photo: Netflix)\n\nWithout a strong investment in the characters, In the Tall Grass is nothing but a cool, gross, weird, horror movie. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. It\u2019s a movie that can legit freak you out just by showing a screen full of green grass. But still, Natali definitely aspired to more.\n\nIn the Tall Grass had its world premiere at Fantastic Fest 2019 this weekend. It premieres on Netflix October 4.", "description": "When Stephen King makes cars, animals, housekeepers, diseases, or clowns scary, it somehow all makes sense. Those things can actually be scary.
