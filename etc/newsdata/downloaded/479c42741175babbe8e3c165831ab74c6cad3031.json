Visiting a country that (to be honest) didn\u2019t have the greatest reputation in the US. Growing up I ONLY heard negative things. But lately, I\u2019ve heard GREAT things! What gets to the news usually doesn\u2019t represent the actual daily life.\u201d\n\nRelated: Pakistan offers tax holiday for foreign investments in tourism sector\n\nIn her very next post, she ditched her \u201cboring clothes\u201d because dresses here are \u201cway better.\u201d Wearing Jasmine hand garlands, she spoke about hearing she has got Pakistani features. \u201cDay 1 as PAKIST-ALYNE! I heard I have Pakistani features so I\u2019m blending right in. ALSO I packed only 1 shirt and 1 pants, and I\u2019m happy I did because the clothes here are WAY BETTER! Goodbye to my boring clothes, hello to Pakistani style!\u201d\n\nDonning a traditional Balochi dress and complementing it with truck art on a local bus, she wrote, \u201cHello, it\u2019s me, your local Karachi Bus Driver \u2013 coming to pick you up IN STYLE! Taking this photo was a cultural experience.\u201d She paid gratitude to Karachi for \u201cthe great day.\u201d\n\nAnd since \u2018Whosoever hasn\u2019t seen Lahore hasn\u2019t really lived\u2019, so Alyne packed her bags for Lahore to enjoy the cuisine and obviously, to visit the acclaimed Wagah Border. With \u201cIndia photobombing\u201d in her otherwise exquisite photo with two security personnel, she told her parents she is fine. \u201d\n\nFollowing Lahore, she planned to visit up North with her cute unicorn.\n\nIn one of her Instgaram stories, Alyne spoke about how she had always been told about the gorgeous mountains of Switzerland and nothing about the Nothern areas of Pakistan which is equally beautiful if not more. She donned a traditional attire posing for a bunch of photos in the midst of Lake Attabad.\n\nIt is not the first time a renown tourist has visited Pakistan. Famous content creators like Eva Zu Beck, Drew Binsky, Rosie Gabrielle, Alexander \u2014 the Rickshaw guy, amongst others have been visiting Pakistan and speaking at length about the beauty it possesses and the hospitality they get from the people of Pakistan.\n\nWhat are your views on the story?
