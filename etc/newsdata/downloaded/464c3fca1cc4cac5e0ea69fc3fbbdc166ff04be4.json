Buzz60\n\nGeneral Electric is offering about 100,000 former workers a \u201climited-time option\u201d to take their pensions in a lump sum. But experts say such buyout deals may not be as good as they seem.\n\nThe pension buyout, as well as GE\u2019s pension freeze for more than 20,000 workers, is part of the company\u2019s effort to lower its debt following years of acquisitions and financial struggles. The industrial conglomerate estimates the measures will reduce its pension deficit by as much as $8 billion. Other companies have also offered buyouts recently, including FedEx and Verizon.\n\nBuyout offers present a quandary to employees who must decide whether to take a one-time payout or stick with the guarantee of a pension.\n\nOn the one hand, employees may be tempted to take what could be a significant sum of money and invest it themselves. But the downside is losing out on years of guaranteed monthly payments that can fund Americans\u2019 increasingly long retirements.\n\nGE on Monday announced changes to its pension plan in an effort to reduce the company's pension obligations and net debt.

That's a lot of money.\u2019 But you have to be very careful before you take that lump sum.\u201d\n\nPeople who take lump-sum payments don\u2019t have a sterling track record in managing the money, according to a 2017 survey from MetLife. One in five of those who took a buyout burned through the money in less than six years, it found. And among those who hadn\u2019t spent their money, about one in three told MetLife they were anxious the money would run out.\n\nBuyouts are cheaper for businesses\n\nCompanies offer lump-sum buyouts because it\u2019s typically cheaper for them in the long run. Partially that\u2019s due to longer life spans, with some Americans spending 30 or 40 years in retirement, compared with a 10- or 20-year retirement for previous generations. That\u2019s making pensions more expensive for businesses.\n\n\u201cThe latest statistic is that a 65-year-old couple in good health has an 85% chance that one spouse will live to 90,\u201d says Scott Sparks, a wealth management advisor for Northwestern Mutual, citing the investment company\u2019s research. \u201cMore times than not, if you lived a normal life expectancy, the pension would be larger than what you will be offered by a lump sum.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Friedman of the Pension Right Center says a lump-sum buyout may only make financial sense for a few types of people, such as those in poor health who don\u2019t expect to live decades in retirement, and those with other sources of income, such as another pension or independent wealth.\n\nIt's also important to understand that pensions come with some protections, including backing from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation that it will pay some or all of a worker's pension in case their employer's pension fails. But lump-sum payments don\u2019t come with the same backing, Friedman notes.\n\nBelow are 3 issues experts say to consider before accepting a lump-sum buyout.\n\nTry to calculate your lifespan\n\nAmericans tend to underestimate how long they\u2019ll spend in retirement, Sparks notes.\n\n\u201cPeople think they won't live as long as they do, so a lump sum feels good and the immediate gratification in their own minds feels good,\u201d he notes.\n\nBut extreme old age is increasingly common, with Northwestern Mutual\u2019s research finding a healthy couple at age 65 have a 29% chance that one of them will live to 100 years old. In that case, sticking with a pension may be more lucrative.\n\nNorthwestern Mutual offers a lifespan calculator that uses your current age and other information to estimate your likely longevity.\n\nConsider other income sources\n\nIt\u2019s important to evaluate your other sources of income in retirement, experts say. For instance, if you have another pension to rely on, such as from another employer or a spouse, that can help allay concerns about the financial risks of taking a lump-sum payout.\n\n\u201cThere are situations where a lump sum does work for people, such as if you are on your sickbed, if you have a lot of other money or you think you'll earn a lot more in the future,\u201d Friedman says.\n\nAre you a smart enough investor?\n\nA pension is a professionally managed investment that\u2019s guaranteed to pay retirees throughout their golden years. But taking a lump-sum buyout means the responsibility of investing will be on your shoulders, experts noted.\n\n\u201cMost economists say it's a rare day where you can invest it well enough that you can replicate the guaranteed money from the pension,\u201d Friedman says.\n\nFor those who opt for the buyout, consider hiring an advisor who can help provide guidance, adds Northwestern Mutual\u2019s Sparks.\n\nHe adds, \u201cHave some counsel and seek some advice if you are going to take the lump sum. Don't assume you are knowledgeable because you are an engineer and smart.\u201d\n\nCLOSE You can retire on just $30,000 a year at these destinations outside of the U.S. USA TODAY\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/11/ge-pension-freeze-raises-question-lump-sum-payout-or-benefits/3923703002/", "description": "Buyout offers present a quandary to employees who must decide whether to take a one-time payout or stick with the guarantee of a pension.", "authors": ["Aimee Picchi", "Special To Usa Today", "Published A.M.
