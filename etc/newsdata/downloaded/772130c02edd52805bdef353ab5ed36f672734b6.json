We support this policy which reinforces that domestic violence has no place in our society and cannot be tolerated.\u201d\n\nIn a Yankees season marked by an uncanny number of injuries, German has been the team\u2019s most dependable and effective starting pitcher for the bulk of 2019, going 18-4 with a 4.03 ERA. His 18 wins ranked tied for second in the AL behind Houston\u2019s Justin Verlander.\n\nWith the Yankees toying with a creative deployment of their pitching during the postseason, German pitched most recently in a \u201cpiggyback\u201d role in relief of CC Sabathia on Wednesday night, pitching 2\u2153 scoreless innings in a 3-2 loss to the Los Angeles Angels.\n\n\u201cI view Domingo playing a really big role for us in the postseason, hopefully,\u201d Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said of German last week. \u201cThere\u2019s a number of different roles he could fill. I can very easily see him starting games. I can see him coming in for an inning [in relief] in a big spot. I can see him giving us length out of the \u2018pen.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, the Yankees welcomed the return of ace Luis Severino, who made his 2019 debut Tuesday after missing the entire season to that point with shoulder and lat injuries, but also lost top reliever Dellin Betances for the season to a partially torn Achilles\u2019 tendon.\n\nThe Yankees entered Thursday at 99-54 and trailing the Houston Astros by one game in the race for the majors\u2019 top overall record and home field advantage throughout the postseason.", "description": "Right-hander will remain on leave for a minimum of seven games, per MLB\u2019s domestic violence policy.", "authors": ["Dave Sheinin", "National Baseball Writer"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OSMYIEW3BAI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
