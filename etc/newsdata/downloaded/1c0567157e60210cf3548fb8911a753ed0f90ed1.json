He was allegedly caught fleeing from the scene in possession of Ivanov's backpack and covered in blood.\n\nHe is also the only person who may be identified since his name is already in the public domain.\n\nREAD: Moving memorial service held for slain Ukrainian hiker\n\nThe court has ordered that the identity of the other two accused and their pictures not be published before the identity parade is held.\n\nOne of the three accused had been out on parole at the time that Ivanov was killed.\n\n\n\nA petition was started in July against the accused's release on bail. It had more than 15 000 signatures as of August 21.\n\nIvanov was taking a few rest days after a business trip for Bureau Veritas to South Africa, to train specialists in the certification of commodities. Although born in Odessa, Ukraine, he was based in Switzerland at the time of his death.\n\nHe decided to start a hike at East Fort on July 27, which is metres away from the famous Chapman's Peak Drive when he was stabbed to death.\n\nOther people at the tourist spot raised the alarm. The three accused are from Hout Bay.\n\nThey will not appear in court in person on October 25, as the matter will be heard via audio visual stream.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
