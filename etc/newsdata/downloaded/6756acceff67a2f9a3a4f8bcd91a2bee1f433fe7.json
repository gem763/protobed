In that time, exports of Scotch Whisky to the US and of American Whiskey to the UK and Europe have grown significantly, benefitting communities on both sides of the Atlantic, boosting investment, employment and prosperity for all,\" Betts said.\n\nAntoine Leccia, the president of the French Association of Wine and Spirit Exporters (FEVS), lamented the tariffs announcement, saying they, \"will severely impact French wine producers and exporters, but also our customers and consumers in the United States\" and are \"good news for no one.\"\n\nIn Ireland, where the beloved Kerrygold butter comes from, the Irish Farmers Association Dairy Chairman Tom Phelan noted that Kerrygold is now the second-highest selling butter brand in the U.S., and other exporters have entered the exporting butter market in recent times as well.\n\n\u201cThese tariffs have the potential to reduce margins or market share or both,\" Phelan said, calling on the EU and the Irish government to \"make every effort to negotiate our way back to normal trade flows.\"\n\nTom Werner/Getty Images, FILE\n\nKafarakis said they don't see this coming to an end anytime soon.\n\n\"We\u2019re still scratching our heads thinking what do we have to do with this as a food industry,\" Kafarakis said of the tariffs on foods and agricultural products that came out of the EU's subsidies for Airbus. \"We are kind of caught in a political game and food is being used as weapon which is really disappointing.\"\n\nWhile consumers are likely to take a hit from these tariffs, \"It's going to devastate these family-run retail operations\" and hurt \"small businesses and entrepreneurs, particularly in the food industry.\"", "description": "A 25% tariff on a myriad of European food and agriculture products will go into effect later this month, here's how it impacts you.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/grocery-store-gty-jt-191007_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
