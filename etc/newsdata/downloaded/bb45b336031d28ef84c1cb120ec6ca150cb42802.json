Nearing the lower section of the climb, where the singular safety chain is located, the girl reportedly lost her footing, began running out of control, before falling and rolling approximately 20 \u2013 30 metres down Uluru.\n\nSomewhat miraculously, the girl is said to have escaped the fall without any critical injuries. Instead, she suffered a compound fracture of her finger, an undisclosed ankle injury, and a series of bumps and grazes from the fall and subsequent roll.\n\nREAD MORE This Shit Cannot End Soon Enough\n\nSeveral bystanders rendered assistance to both the girl and her family, with the girl reportedly being carried down the remainder of Uluru before she was attended to by emergency personnel at the Yulara clinic, who subsequently transported her to the Alice Springs Hospital. Staff there confirmed the patient is in a stable condition.\n\nThe fall comes just under two weeks prior to climbing being banned altogether on October 26th; a ceremonial date chosen to mark the anniversary of the site\u2019s handback to traditional First Nations owners.\n\nDespite this, thousands upon thousands of tourists have reportedly been treating it as a last-chance deadline and not a gradual phasing out, clogging the climbing route and creating fairly horrible-looking human traffic jams on Uluru. This, despite signs respectfully urging tourists to consider not climbing being in place for decades.", "description": "A 12-year-old girl is lucky to be alive after falling and rolling some 20 metres while descedning Uluru, just under 2 weeks prior to the climb ending.", "authors": ["Cam Tyeson"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/uluru-fall.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
