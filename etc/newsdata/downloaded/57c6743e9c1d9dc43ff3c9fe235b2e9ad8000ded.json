Here's what that means and why each full moon has its own name.", "language": "en", "text": "On the night of Friday, September 13, look to the skies for a rare occurrence: a full harvest micromoon.\n\nThe micromoon will appear about 14% smaller than a supermoon because it will be at apogee \u2014 its furthest point from Earth. The harvest moon is the full moon that falls closest to the autumnal equinox in September (or October \u2014 the moon doesn't follow the Gregorian calendar). They don't coincide that often.\n\nWhat's more, a full moon won't fall on Friday the 13th again until August 2049.\n\nAcross North America and Europe, people have used full moons to track months and seasons for thousands of years, naming each one based on the seasonal changes it indicated.\n\nThe names assigned to full moons are often attributed to the various Algonquian peoples who share a family of languages, living from what is today New England as far west as Lake Superior. Colonial settlers across North America adopted their own version of the indigenous names, according to The Old Farmer's Almanac.\n\nDifferent languages and cultures characterized their moons differently, sometimes based on agricultural cycles, sometimes on natural phenomena. Here are some of the many names assigned to full moons throughout the year.", "description": "You've probably heard of Harvest Moons and Buck Moons, but what about Wolf Moons and Worm Moons and Fish Moons?", "authors": ["Rebecca Harrington", "Morgan Mcfall-Johnsen"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/57daaf5e077dcc1e008b60d9-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
