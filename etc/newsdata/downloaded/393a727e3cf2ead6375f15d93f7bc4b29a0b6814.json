It\u2019s just a local football match, yet we haven\u2019t had a say and we can\u2019t opt out.\n\n\u2018Thousands of innocent fans who have never committed a crime in their lives, including children, will have their faces scanned and data collected by police.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s the sort of thing you\u2019d expect to see in a surveillance state.\u2019\n\nThe south Wales derby has been a historically tense game.\n\nWhen Cardiff won a League Cup game at Swansea in September 1988, about 50 Swansea fans reportedly chased around 30 Cardiff supporters into the Bristol Channel.\n\nThree years later, 39 fans were arrested when fans fought at an FA Cup clash at Swansea.\n\nThe two teams have not played each other for five years.\n\nRights groups have also criticised the technology.\n\nBig Brother Watch, a privacy campaigning group, are pursuing a crowdfunded legal challenge against the Metropolitan Police and Home Secretary over their use of facial recognition surveillance.\n\nSilkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch, said: \u2018We stand by fans who are rightly alarmed and outraged.\n\n\u2018The police decision to target them with intrusive mass surveillance treats all fans as suspects, damages trust and is a total waste of public money.\n\n\u2018Police are eroding basic civil liberties whilst politicians look the other way.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
