The South African economy grew 0.8% in 2018 and is estimated to grow a mere 1.1% this year. By comparison, Facebook grew 28%. Google grew 19%. The data signals an imbalance between how effective advertising is on the platforms and makes it clear that the platforms are benefiting, not the businesses who are spending on them.\n\nWhile platforms may have reach and audience engagement, it may not be the right environment for marketers to achieve their business growth objectives.\n\nThe platforms know this better than anyone, which is why they have all built walled gardens that do not allow marketers to independently verify advertising effectiveness. User privacy has become a convenient cover for both Facebook and Google in the past year to limit how marketers can use audience data for targeting and attribution. The platforms not only mark their own homework by telling marketers how their campaigns performed but also are in a conflicted position to take credit for value they may not have created.", "description": "By 2020, digital advertising in SA will be the largest media channel.", "authors": ["Kunal Gupta"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7959/42a1e2cbaf7a44ddbcc67bc0e3c14aee.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
