New data from the U.S. Census Bureau show that the gulf between the highest earners and everyone else is the widest it's been in at least 50 years.\n\nFor decades, income growth among higher-earning families in the U.S. has far outpaced that of lower-income households, prompting proposals from some lawmakers to increase taxes on the ultra-rich. The economy has grown for 123 straight months, or just over 10 years. That tops the previous record expansion that lasted from March 1991 to March 2001, according to Natixis.\n\n\"When you have a system where inequality is rising \u2013 and where some groups are perpetually overrepresented at the bottom of the income and wealth distribution, even when they follow the standard prescription for realizing the American Dream \u2013 it's a recipe for a politically and socially divided nation,\" said Cornell sociology professor Kim Weeden, director of the school's Center for the Study of Inequality.\n\nRay Dalio says wealth inequality is a national emergency\n\nThe Census annually tracks income inequality using a standard measure known as the Gini coefficient (The number ranges from 0, which indicates that a nation's income is equally distributed, to a maximum of 1, meaning a single person collects the entirety of country's income.) In 2018, America's Gini coefficient rose to 0.485 \u2014 that is \"significantly higher\" than its score the previous year, according to the bureau.\n\nWeeden added that the latest Census data don't tell the whole story, noting that wealth \u2014 which factors in assets like the value of a home or stock holdings \u2014 is even more uneven in the U.S. than income, which for most people comes from their wages and salaries.\n\n\"Many of the major economic decisions that middle-class Americans make \u2013 whether it's to start a new business or to purchase a home in a neighborhood with well-resourced schools for their children \u2013 are more closely tied to wealth than to income,\" she said.\n\nStates with the worst inequality\n\nAround the U.S., income inequality is significantly higher in five states, the Census data show: California, Connecticut, Florida, Louisiana and New York. That gap has been especially visible in places like California and New York, with their sprinklings of tech and Wall Street billionaires, respectively, as well as large populations of poor and homeless people.\n\nCBS News poll: Americans split on the future of the economy\n\nBut inequality is also taking root in other parts of the country. Louisiana, for one, has a Gini coefficient of 0.494, making it more unequal than dozens of other states. The reason: The incomes of Louisiana's richest families have grown far more quickly than than incomes for the poorest, previous research has found.\n\nNine states saw a widening of income inequality last year, the Census said:\n\nAlabama\n\nArkansas\n\nCalifornia\n\nKansas\n\nNebraska\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNew Mexico\n\nTexas\n\nVirginia\n\nSome critics contend that the new U.S. tax code, signed into law by President Donald Trump at the end of 2017, is exacerbating the problem because the lion's share of the tax breaks go to the wealthy.\n\nMeanwhile, Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who are both campaigning for the 2020 presidential election, have rolled out separate wealth tax proposals. While they vary on the details, they both propose raising taxes on the assets of the ultra-rich and using the additional revenue to fund social programs such as education and health care.", "description": "Gap between rich and poor is widening even as the economy extends its record period of growth", "authors": ["Aimee Picchi"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/06/04/cbcd075f-d5cf-4e86-a68d-63d3368e8c57/thumbnail/1200x630/deee35aaf970039967e7b738dfcc23ad/la-homeless-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
