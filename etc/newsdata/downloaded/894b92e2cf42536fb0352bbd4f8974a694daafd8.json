The ECB is expected to cut the deposit rate even more.\n\nThe negative rates are supposed to discourage banks from parking cash with the ECB rather than lending it out or investing it.\n\nThe primary objective of the ECB's monetary policy is to maintain price stability. It aims at inflation rates of below, but close to, 2%.\n\nThat's not the case now.\n\nIn June inflation was at 1.3%, just a bit higher than in May. But still rather far from the ECB target.\n\nThe ECB's policy is not based on GDP growth, and yet Mario Draghi said: \"Incoming economic data and survey information continue to point to somewhat slower growth in the second and third quarters of this year. This mainly reflects the ongoing weakness in international trade in an environment of prolonged global uncertainties, which are particularly affecting the euro area manufacturing sector.\"\n\nMario Draghi's non-renewable eight-year term at the ECB expires at the end of October.\n\nThe exiting president of the ECB famously vowed to do \"whatever it takes\" to preserve the eurozone currency 7 years ago.\n\nIntroducing more stimulus in September would be in line with that promise and would help lay the ground for his successor, Christine Lagarde.\n\nWhen asked about a possible job swap with her, Draghi said he is not available.\n\nWant more news?", "description": "The European Central Bank kept interest rates unchanged at the meeting in Frankfurt  with the main refinancing rate remaining at zero and the deposit rate at minus 0.4%.", "authors": ["Oleksandra Vakulina"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/05/39/02/1000x563_cmsv2_7a3b9046-d172-5427-bfb8-7fdf9c33fc71-4053902.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-25"}
