This is totally unacceptable. The authorities must immediately put an end to this hostility towards human rights.\"\n\nAmnesty accused the police, military and the Department of State Services (DSS) secret police of being responsible for the clampdown on press freedom in Nigeria.\n\nIt cited the case of Abiri Jones, the publisher of Weekly Source who was arrested in 2016 and detained without access to family or lawyers for two years by the DSS.\n\n\"He was released on 15 August 2018 and rearrested on 20 May 2019 before being put on trial for terrorism and cybercrimes charges,\" it added.\n\nSome of the other journalists mentioned in the report said that they had been beaten and \"tortured\" during interrogations.\n\nIn January the Nigerian security forces raided the offices of prominent newspaper Daily Trust over its coverage of the Boko Haram insurgency in the northeast of the country.\n\nLocal and international rights bodies have frequently accused Nigeria's security forces of abuses, including arbitrary arrests and extra-judicial executions.\n\nThe authorities have consistently denied the allegations.", "description": "Amnesty International says journalists in Nigeria are operating under a \"climate of fear\", after 19 reporters were detained by security forces this year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9410/75b8ec280ff54a72b483cb305afea08b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
