Like so many others, Bolton will go down as someone driven by unquenchable thirst for relevance and power with the hubris to think he could bend President Trump to his will. Instead, Bolton became an enabler for a president who allowed himself to be snowed by North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un and revealed he never had a game plan for Iran (and would not use force or the credible threat of force).\n\nRather than quit on principle at dozens of junctures, Bolton clung to his job, only to be rudely fired. The Post reports:\n\nPresident Trump announced Tuesday that he had fired his national security adviser, John Bolton, saying in tweets that he \u201cdisagreed strongly with many of his suggestions.\u201d \u201cI informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House,\u201d Trump said on Twitter.\u201cI asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning. I thank John very much for his service.\u201d\n\nBolton, to put it mildly, never played well with others and therefore was uniquely unqualified for the job of national security adviser, who is supposed to be the honest broker in government. It would be an understatement to say both anti-Trump conservatives and Democrats are positively giddy seeing the blusterous, aggressive adviser end his career in semi-disgrace. Quite apart from the double scoop of schadenfreude, many in the foreign policy community are genuinely relieved. \u201cI\u2019m just thankful we got through Bolton\u2019s tenure without him starting a war,\u201d said Max Bergmann of the Center for American Progress and a former State Department official. \u201cHe no doubt tried, but was boxed in by the administration\u2019s own incompetence and his inability to convince others to go along.\u201d\n\nOthers, however, are more worried now. Former ambassador to Turkey, Eric S. Edelman, told me, \u201cFor his flaws, I think John was one of the few forces really holding Trump back from doing some crazy things. This is is just one more indication that we are now facing Trump unplugged. He is really thrashing around. It is very worrisome.\u201d\n\n[The Post\u2019s View: John Bolton\u2019s legacy: Chaos, dysfunction and no meaningful accomplishments]\n\nVeteran diplomat Aaron David Miller notes, \u201cYou can only play Dr. No so many times. Bolton was out of sync with Trump on Iran, North Korea, Afghanistan and Venezuela.\" He added, \u201c[Secretary of State Mike] Pompeo played the game of Trump whisperer better than Bolton.\u201d Precisely because Bolton differed with Trump on all these topics, sycophantic Sens. Tom Cotton, Ted Cruz and other uber-hawks who thought they, too, could bend Trump toward their view should wise up. Trump is not a valiant defender of the West and protector of our allies. He\u2019s a dangerous and corrupt patsy in the hands of strongmen.\n\nLikewise, Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), who served in the Obama administration, said, \u201cNo glee [here]. I\u2019ve obviously never been a Bolton fan, and I\u2019m glad there are still international institutions he didn\u2019t have time to pull us out of.\u201d However, he said, Bolton \u201cwas fired for something he was right about \u2014 his opposition to capitulating to the Taliban \u2014 and because Trump doesn\u2019t like being laughed at and needed to lash out at someone. I worry about who and what comes next.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority leader Charles Schumer put out a statement which read, \u201cToday\u2019s action by the president is just the latest example of his government-by-chaos approach and his rudderless national security policy. When Ambassador Bolton\u2019s extreme views aren\u2019t enough for you, the United States is headed for even more chaotic times.\u201d Indeed, the picture of disarray and paralysis gets worse with each new departure.\n\nThis is also a dicey move for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who sacrificed bipartisan friendship with the United States to gain favor in the eyes of Trump. Netanyahu kids himself if he thinks Trump would let Israel stand in the way of the historic deal he is itching to sign. Former Israeli ambassador Daniel Shapiro tells me, \u201cTrump fired Bolton over disagreements they had. Chief among them was Bolton\u2019s support for ever-escalating pressure on Iran versus Trump\u2019s desire for talks on a new nuclear deal.\u201d He adds, \"Israel and the Gulf states have to wonder if this move presages not just a meeting between Trump and [Iranian President Hassan] Rouhani, but a real move by Trump toward a modestly upgraded Iran nuclear deal. It sure looks like it.\u201d In fact any deal is likely to be worse, given that the Iranians know Trump is the worst negotiator on the planet.\n\nOther allies should be equally nervous since when unrestrained, even from questionable advice, Trump does things such as invite the Taliban to Camp David, side with Putin over our intelligence community, try to pullout abruptly from Syria, attack allies (even Denmark), involve us in a no-win trade war and make the United States a laughingstock on the international stage.\n\nIf Bolton wants to save his reputation, he can render one final service: Collect up all the former national security officials and tell the American people just how unfit is this president. It\u2019s time for the sycophancy and careerism to end and the patriotism to start.\n\nRead more:\n\nPaul Waldman: Trump\u2019s firing of Bolton was good.
