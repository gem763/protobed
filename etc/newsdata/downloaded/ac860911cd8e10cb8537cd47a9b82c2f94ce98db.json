blocked by Speaker John Bercow\n\nBoris Johnson is set for a showdown with Commons Speaker John Bercow as the Prime Minister pushes for a knife-edge Commons vote on his Brexit deal.\n\nMr Bercow, who Tory Brexiteers have accused of being pro-Remain, will rule on whether the Government can bring a so-called \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 on its plans.\n\nIf the Speaker blocks the move, focus will switch to the Government bringing its Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) before MPs on Monday, with a vote on its second reading on Tuesday.\n\nMinisters insist they \u2018have the numbers\u2019 to push the agreement through, but the parliamentary situation appears to be on a tightrope.\n\nLabour has made clear it will try to hijack the legislation by putting down amendments for a second Brexit referendum and a customs union with the EU.\n\nBoris Johnson could not get his deal through on Saturday after MPs voted for the Letwin Amendment (Picture: House of Commons)\n\nAround 1,000,000 people

national poll against a Remain option.\n\nHarry reveals he and William have 'good and bad days' as he addresses feud rumours\n\nShadow solicitor general Nick Thomas-Symonds said that Labour MPs will call for a confirmatory referendum, adding that he thought Parliament may vote in favour of Britain staying in a customs union with the bloc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018A customs union is going to be one of the amendments that comes through and that is something that is going to have a very good chance of getting a majority,\u2019 Mr Thomas-Symonds told BBC Radio 4\u2019s The Westminster Hour.\n\nDespite being forced by Parliament to request a Brexit delay from Brussels after another embarrassing Commons defeat on Saturday, Mr Johnson and Ministers are talking up their chances of rushing Brexit legislation through.\n\nThe move came amid reports that the EU was considering offering the UK a \u2018flexible extension\u2019 to February, allowing it to leave whenever an agreement is secured.\n\nMinisters insist they \u2018have the numbers\u2019 to push the agreement through (Picture: PA)\n\nShadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer indicated Labour could even back the

covered in blood after car completely flipped over\n\nHe abandoned plans for a meaningful vote on a Saturday sitting of the Commons after suffering an embarrassing defeat at the hands of former Tory minister Sir Oliver Letwin.\n\nBut the PM had not suffered a loss but achieved a \u2018boost to his strategy\u2019, according to former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith.\n\n\u2018For every time he is forced to take a defiant stand against the Remainers in Parliament, it only becomes clearer to the British public just who is fighting desperately and against the odds to deliver their wishes, and who is to blame for the fact that Brexit is not yet over,\u2019 Mr Duncan Smith wrote in The Daily Telegraph.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter losing the vote, Mr Johnson had no option but to write to European Council president Donald Tusk, as Parliament demanded, requesting a three-month extension to the end of January.\n\nLabour has made clear it will try to hijack the legislation by

on its plans (Picture: House of Commons)\n\nThe PM did not sign the letter, and sent a second communication insisting that a delay would be \u2018deeply corrosive\u2019 for the UK and the EU.\n\nBritain's worst female paedophile staying in hostel 500 metres from nursery\n\nLabour accused Mr Johnson of behaving like a \u2018spoiled brat\u2019.\n\nThe DUP was reported to be considering backing Labour\u2019s move to force a new customs union with the EU into WAB legislation.\n\nCommons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg told MPs the Government aimed to hold a meaningful vote on the Brexit deal on Monday.\n\nMr Bercow said he would consider whether to allow the Government\u2019s plans, but he could rule that such a vote effectively happened on Saturday and cannot be repeated so soon.\n\nMr Johnson and Ministers are talking up their chances of rushing Brexit legislation through (Picture: PA)\n\nHowever, party chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson told BBC Radio 5 Live he wanted to engage with the Government to see \u2018where things stand\u2019.\n\nIf the PM\u2019s deal is amended he will have no choice but to accept a long delay to the UK\u2019s departure from the bloc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Government source said: \u2018Parliament needs a straight up-and-down vote on the deal\u2026 or do they want to frustrate and cancel Brexit altogether?\n\n\u2018We cannot allow Parliament\u2019s letter to lead to Parliament\u2019s delay.\u2019\n\nThe source said the WAB would need more late-night and weekend sittings by MPs.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
