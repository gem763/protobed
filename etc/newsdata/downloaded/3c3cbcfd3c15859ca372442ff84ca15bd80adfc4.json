The cells then multiply and grow connective muscle tissue -- eventually becoming a full-sized steak.\n\n\"This cutting-edge research in some of the most extreme environments imaginable, serves as an essential growth indicator of sustainable food production methods that don't exacerbate land waste, water waste, and pollution,\" the release said.\n\nThe space-grown meat could help feed astronauts during long-term manned space missions, as well as address food insecurity among a booming population down on Earth, according to a statement from 3D Bioprinting Solutions.\n\nAleph Farms' products aren't commercially available yet -- but they will likely be ready for the market in three or four years, according to the company.\n\nAn Israeli-Russian project succeeded in growing meat on the International Space Station, seen here in a file photo from 2011.\n\nDidier Toubia, CEO of Aleph Farms, told CNN in August that the factory farming industry had \"lost the connection with the animal,\" and that growing slaughter-free steaks was a better alternative to using cows \"as mere machines to produce steaks.\"\n\nNot only is this process more humane, but it's also better for the environment, the company says -- one of its aims is to make meat with a minimal environmental footprint.\n\nBeef production uses up a lot of land and resources. Cows grow and reproduce slower than pigs and poultry, so they eat a lot more and need more land and water.\n\nBill Gates, Richard Branson and others are investing $17 million in the in vitro meat company Memphis Meats, which produces laboratory-grown meat.\n\n\"In space, we don't have 10,000 or 15,000 liters (3962.58 gallons) of water available to produce one kilogram (2.205 pounds) of beef,\" said Toubia in the Monday press release. \"This joint experiment marks a significant first step toward achieving our vision to ensure food security for generations to come, while preserving our natural resources.\"\n\nThese efforts come as the global climate crisis and population boom continue to grow. A World Resources Institute report in July found that Americans will need to cut their average consumption of beef by about 40% and Europeans by 22%, for the world to continue to feed the 10 billion people expected to live on this planet in 2050.\n\nAll the while, the demand for meat and dairy is expected to rise even faster, by nearly 70%. The global demand for beef, goat and lamb or mutton is expected to be even higher, at 88%.", "description": "Aleph Farms, an Israeli company that engineers beef steaks, announced Monday it had successfully grown meat in space for the first time.", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191008131418-international-space-station-iss-file-2011-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
