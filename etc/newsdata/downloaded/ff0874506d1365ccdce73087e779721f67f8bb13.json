We will not be party to genocide denial. We will not be silent. We will never forget.\n\nHow has Turkey reacted?\n\nIt has strongly condemned the move. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called the vote \"null and void\", linking it to Turkey's military offensive against Kurdish fighters in northern Syria whom it regards as terrorists. Kurdish troops have been allied to the US in fighting the Islamic State (IS) group.\n\nMr Cavusoglu tweeted: \"Those whose projects were frustrated turn to antiquated resolutions. Circles believing that they will take revenge this way are mistaken. This shameful decision of those exploiting history in politics is null and void for our Government and people.\"\n\nTurkey denies that there was a systematic campaign to slaughter Armenians as an ethnic group during World War One.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThere is general agreement that hundreds of thousands of Armenians died when the Ottoman Turks deported them en masse from eastern Anatolia to the Syrian desert and elsewhere in 1915-16. They were killed or died from starvation or disease.\n\nThe total number of Armenian dead is disputed. Armenians say 1.5 million died. The Republic of Turkey estimates the total to be 300,000. According to the International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS), the death toll was \"more than a million\".\n\nThe dispute about whether it was genocide centres on the question of premeditation - the degree to which the killings were orchestrated. Many historians, governments and the Armenian people believe that they were; but a number of scholars question this.\n\nTurkish officials accept that atrocities were committed but argue that there was no systematic attempt to destroy the Christian Armenian people. Turkey says many innocent Muslim Turks also died in the turmoil of war.", "description": "The vote on the mass killings during World War One was condemned by Turkey.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/82521000/jpg/_82521072_82521067.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
