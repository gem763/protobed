While trans fats occur naturally in dairy products like cheese and cream, they are also found in takeaways where vegetable oils have been heated to fry foods at high temperatures.\n\nThe fats can improve the taste and shelf life of processed foods and are also used by some manufacturers in pies, biscuits and cakes.\n\nAlthough they were banned in the US last year, they continue to be present in British food, although health experts say UK intakes are much lower than the recommended maximum.\n\nThe Japanese study involved 1,628 people living in a Japanese community who did not have dementia and had an average age of 70.\n\nThey were divided into four groups based on levels of elaidic acid in their blood, which is often used to measure the amount of trans fats people have consumed.\n\nFollowed up for 10 years on average, people with the group thought to consume the most trans fats were 52 per cent more likely to get dementia than those who consumed the least.\n\nOf the 407 people with the highest level, 104 developed Alzheimer's disease or a different type of dementia, which was almost 30 per cent.\n\nOnly 82 out of the 407 in the lowest level group were diagnosed with dementia, which was just over 21 per cent.\n\nThe results showed a link between trans fats and dementia even when other factors that could affect the risk of dementia, such as high blood pressure, diabetes and smoking, were taken into account.\n\nPeople with the second highest level of trans fats, based on their blood tests, were 74 per cent more likely to develop dementia than those with the lowest level.", "description": "Japanese researchers have now linked these fats to dementia, in a study of more than 1,600 people over 60.
