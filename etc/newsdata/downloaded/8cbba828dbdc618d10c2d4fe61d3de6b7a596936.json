Additional tariffs of 15% on $156 billion of smartphones, laptops, toys, videogames and other products have been postponed until Dec. 15, after the period when goods are typically imported for the holiday season.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Which predictions do you believe about the potential effects of tariffs? Join the conversation below.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely worth it, we don\u2019t want to be servants to the Chinese!\u201d President Trump said Sunday in a tweet, referring to the process of tariffs forcing American importers to look for other suppliers. The tariffs are \u201cabout American freedom,\u201d he added in another tweet. \u201cThere is no reason to buy everything from China!\u201d\n\nMr. Trump cited the views of economist Peter Morici, who was interviewed Sunday on Fox News and said the tariffs would impact average Americans \u201cnot as much as the critics say\u201d due to shifts in exchange rates and supply chains.\n\nBusiness groups and others criticized the tariffs as harmful for American companies and consumers.\n\nAFL-CIO President Richard Trumka credited Mr. Trump for \u201ctaking on China\u201d but said, \u201cunfortunately, he\u2019s done it the wrong way.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo take on China, there has to be a multilateral approach. One country can\u2019t take on China to try to dry up its overcapacity because they just send it through to you in other ways,\u201d Mr. Trumka said an interview on Fox News.\n\nMyron Brilliant, head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said that the president was using the wrong tactic to take on unfair Chinese trade practices. \u201cThe tariffs\u2014import taxes by any other name\u2014are or will cost every American household between $600 and $1,000 by the end of the year.\u201d\n\nPrevious tariffs on Chinese imports are costing the average U.S. household $831 a year through higher prices and reduced economic efficiency, according to a May paper published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe U.S. previously imposed tariffs of 25% on about $250 billion of Chinese imports, largely on items used by businesses, and those tariffs are set to rise to 30% in a month. Mr. Trump has characterized them as a penalty on China, but they are paid by importers in the U.S.\n\nChinese retaliatory measures also went into effect on Sunday, with more to come on Dec. 15. The biggest categories of American exports to be hit with extra tariffs Sunday include $3.2 billion in annual soybean shipments, $2.55 billion in crude oil and $1.16 billion in pharmaceuticals, according to Panjiva Research.\n\nAs Mr. Trump lays on more tariffs, Beijing\u2019s hopes for a trade deal are waning, say people following the trade talks. \u201cChina\u2019s leadership has concluded they\u2019re probably not going to get a deal from Trump,\u201d said Arthur Kroeber, founding partner at research firm Gavekal Dragonomics. \u201cChina doesn\u2019t see an incentive to help out at this point.\u201d\n\nMr. Kroeber and other analysts say China\u2019s strategy involves toughening out the trade turbulence by shoring up its own economy, and waiting for the increased pain on American farmers and companies to translate into lobbying efforts against the Trump administration strategy.\n\nAt the same time, Beijing appears willing to continue engaging in negotiations with the U.S.\n\nWei Jianguo, a former Chinese vice minister of commerce now with Beijing-based think tank China Center for International Economic Exchanges, said Beijing still plans to send trade negotiators to Washington this month to try to get a deal to remove tariffs, however unlikely. \u201cChina is prepared either way,\u201d he said.\n\nChinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a briefing Friday that \u201ctrade teams on both the U.S. and China sides have always maintained effective communication.\u201c He added that \u201dwe hope the U.S. side can demonstrate good faith and take real action, to work in concert with the Chinese side, to find a solution to the problem on the basis of equality and mutual respect.\u201d\n\nTargeting China Each round of tariffs has targeted imports the U.S. relies more on China for than the previous set. $250 billion September 2018 The largest set of tariffs, covering $200 billion worth of imports, affects categories the U.S. imports about a fifth of from China. 200 Value of imports from China 150 Dec. 15, 2019 87% of imports in the categories for which tariffs were delayed come from China.

The U.S. side accused China of backing down on a pledge to make structural changes, such as legal measures to protect intellectual property, while Beijing said it wanted the U.S. to remove existing tariffs before implementing the accord.\n\nSince then negotiators have sought, so far without success, to reach a limited preliminary arrangement that would have China committing to buying more U.S. farm products and the U.S. agreeing to ease off restrictions on China\u2019s Huawei Telecommunications Co.\n\nMr. Trump said late Friday he couldn\u2019t say if he would speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping over the weekend. The two presidents in the past have used personal contact to de-escalate trade tensions, but recent friction over Huawei and other issues have weighed on the relationship.\n\n\u2014Josh Zumbrun and Andrew Restuccia in Washington contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to William Mauldin at william.mauldin@wsj.com and Chao Deng at Chao.Deng@wsj.com", "description": "Tariffs on clothing and other imports from China went into effect, escalating the trade war in a move expected to squarely hit consumers.", "authors": ["William Mauldin", "Chao Deng", "Chao.Deng Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103161/social"}
