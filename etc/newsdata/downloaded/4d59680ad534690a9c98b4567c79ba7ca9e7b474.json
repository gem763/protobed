Last year that collapsed to 8.2 million metric tons, a 77% decline.\n\nMeanwhile, to ease the pain for American farmers hurt by his trade war (not just those who grow soybeans), Trump has showered them with billions of dollars, much of that money borrowed from\u2014guess who\u2014China.\n\nWow! Overseeing a 77% market collapse, followed by a multi-billion dollar bailout using money borrowed from China, to help farmers who once sold to China before being shut out by China. What a deal.\n\nThe White House announced late Friday, after weeks of ballyhoo, a partial trade deal that could possibly ease trade tensions with Beijing. Among the many moving parts includes a Chinese promise to increase purchases of soybeans. The White House was unable to offer any details. Pro tip: If you\u2019re unable to offer any concrete details, it\u2019s probably not a real deal.\n\nYou know what else isn\u2019t real? Just about everything Trump has said about how he\u2019d be great for the U.S. economy.\n\nLet\u2019s start with one important metric: Wage growth. This has increased, on an inflation-adjusted basis, during Trump\u2019s time in office, and he says it\u2019s all because if him. What he doesn\u2019t want you to know is that wages, in real terms, bottomed out in the mid-1990s and have been gradually rising since. Even so wages\u2014again adjusted for inflation\u2014remain far below their peak, which occurred nearly half-a-century ago.\n\nTrump says our economy is \u201cperhaps the greatest economy we\u2019ve had in the history of our country.\u201d What he doesn\u2019t want you to know is that it has never even grown as fast as it did, on occasion, during the Obama years. Trump has never had a quarter with 4% growth for example, while Obama had four (non-consecutive) quarters over 4%, plus two that topped 5%.\n\nYet even with that claim easily shattered, Trump says the U.S. economy is the \u201cenvy of the world.\u201d\n\nAnd this is all despite the massive tax cut he promised would change everything. It only changed one thing: It has returned us to the land of trillion-dollar deficits. But the investment boom Trump promised is nowhere to be found, and one reason for this is because of the trade wars he started with the rest of the world. The uncertainty and havoc he created caused company after company to take the tax cuts and not invest in plant and equipment like he said (some raise dividends for shareholders or lavished ever-bigger bonuses on executives, though). Trump gave companies incentive, and capital, to expand\u2014then took it right back with his trade wars.\n\nShall I continue?\n\nTrump says that thanks to him, the U.S has become a jobs machine. Oh? Then how to explain that job growth has slowed since he took office? Data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that during Trump\u2019s first 32 months on the job (February 2017 through September 2019), 5.53 million jobs were added to the economy. As Obama was leaving, his last 32 months (June 2014 to January 2017) showed 6.97 million jobs were created\u2014nearly 21% more than Trump. Here, see for yourself:\n\nSpeaking of jobs, here\u2019s something that will really drive Trump and his believers crazy: far more jobs were created per month on Jimmy Carter\u2019s watch than so far, on Trump\u2019s. Trump\u2019s first 32 months have averaged nearly 173,000 jobs while Carter\u2019s 48 months averaged 204,000. Even with a U.S. population about 40% bigger, Trump doesn\u2019t come anywhere near Carter. Sad!\n\nTrump keeps saying China is paying for the tariffs. What he won\u2019t tell you is that the cost has fallen \u201centirely\u201d on U.S. businesses and households\u2014at least that\u2019s what investment banking giant Goldman Sachs says. That\u2019s on top of a similar JPMorgan Chase study that said the cost to the average American household could be an extra $1,000 next year, as Trump runs for re-election. It\u2019s unclear as I write this how Friday\u2019s \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal with Beijing will affect these and other analyses.\n\nMaybe the president should walk down the hall and talk to his chief economic advisor, Larry Kudlow\u2014who has contradicted his boss on this. Speaking the truth? In the Trump White House? Shocking, and that\u2019s why I predict this future news headline: \u201cKudlow Out at White House.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of who\u2019s paying for what, even Trump\u2019s base has probably figured out by now that he was lying about Mexico paying for the wall. What Trump doesn\u2019t want them (or anyone) to know is that he\u2019s beefing up a portion of it by taking money away from military families instead\u2014hurting our brave men and women in uniform, their children, and overall military readiness. See for yourself.\n\nIf I had more room, I could give more examples of how the president has hoodwinked his base\u2014on economics, foreign policy and more. I wish they would understand that when it comes to manufacturing and distributing what he likes to call \u201cfake news,\u201d Donald Trump reigns supreme.", "description": "You know what else isn\u2019t real?
