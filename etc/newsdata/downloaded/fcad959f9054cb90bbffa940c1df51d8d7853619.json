It is unclear if there is a crossover between the groups.\n\nPolice are now urgently working closely with the embassies of both Vietnam and China to try and establish the identities of those who had lost their lives.\n\nA series of desperate texts, sent at the same time that the refrigerated trailer was making its way to Purfleet in Essex, where Pham Thi Tra My tells her mother \"love you so much\" and \"I am sorry\" More\n\nDeputy Chief Constable Pippa Mills said that she \u201cwould like to speak directly to anyone who thinks their loved ones may have been in the trailer\u201d as she assured them that the police only wanted \u201cto give the victims\u2019 families answers about what has happened\u201d.\n\nAnyone in Britain illegally who came forward with information will not face criminal action, she said.\n\nDCC Mills revealed that Essex police now have four people in custody in relation to the deaths.\n\nA 48 year-old man from Northern Ireland was arrested at Stansted Airport on Friday.\n\nEarlier a 38-year-old man and a 38-year-old woman from Warrington Cheshire - named locally as Joanna and Thomas Maher \u2013 had been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people and on suspicion of 39 counts of manslaughter.\n\nThe driver of the truck, named locally as 25-year-old Mo Robinson, from Northern Ireland, remains in custody after he was held on suspicion of murder in the early hours of Wednesday morning.\n\nThe news of the arrests came as the family of Miss Pham revealed a series of messages she sent at 10.30pm on Tuesday, as the container would have been making the crossing from Zeebrugge in Belgium to Purfleet in Essex, in which she told her mother that she \u201cloved her so much\u201d.\n\nWhat we know so far\n\n39 bodies found in lorry container They were 31 men, eight women Driver from Northern Ireland arrested Lorry cabin registered in Bulgaria in 2017 Container docked in Essex having travelled from Belgium Bodies discovered at Waterglade Industrial Park, Grays Two men and one woman arrested on suspicion of trafficking and manslaughter\n\nIn messages from the account saved as \u201cdaughter\u201d, Miss Pham wrote: \u201cI\u2019m sorry Mum.
