But it's rarely just about sex.\n\nLooking back on the relationship, there were hundreds of tiny details that never felt quite right.\n\nThe way he started turning away in bed to check his phone, the fact that she seemed to know everything about your relationship, the number of times they just happened to run into each other.\n\nBut it\u2019s surprising what you can teach yourself to ignore, simply because you don\u2019t want to face the truth.\n\nIn *Emma\u2019s case, the truth was even more heartbreaking \u2013 because the man cheating on her was her childhood best friend.\n\n\u201cThey were friends for maybe a year - that much I knew,\u201d she shared on Reddit.\n\n\u201cI first started having suspicions back in May and he told me it was nothing.\u201d\n\nRead how this woman discovered her partner had been cheating after their daughter's first birthday and the mum whose entire 10-year marriage was a lie.\n\n\u201cI don't know what to feel. I feel, numb honestly.\" Source: iStock\n\n\"I don't know what to feel\"\n\nBy September, Emma could no longer pretend that nothing was happening between her partner and his \"friend\".\n\nShe immediately ended things - and then three days later he confessed that he and this other woman had been seeing each other for a month.\n\nAs hurtful as that confession was \u2013 things were about to get a hell of a lot worse for Emma.\n\n\u201cI shouldn't have done it but I used my sneaky fake Facebook to look up his profile, he's blocked on my real one. He's asked her to marry him, and she said 'yes',\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI don't know what to feel. I feel, numb honestly.\n\n\u201c27 days after I found out about the cheating and she's his wife-to-be. There's very little chance this whole thing started a mere month before we broke up.\"\n\n\"She gets his name and his ring\"\n\nThere\u2019s also a part of Emma that wonders why he chose to propose to this other woman instead of her.\n\n\u201cWe never married despite being together since 2017,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt feels in a way like I'm being punished for not accepting his cheating and lying.\n\n\u201cLike he wants to marry her right away because she's blinder than I was ...or something.\n\n\u201cObviously he lied so much to us both. But she gets his name and his ring.\u201d\n\nThe other woman gets his name and his ring - leaving Emma to wonder what else she'd like to take. Source: Pinterest\n\n\u201cHow long did this actually go on for?\"\n\nThe entire thing has left Emma completely humiliated, with hundreds of unanswered questions.\n\n\u201cHow long did this actually go on for?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cDid they seriously get engaged after two months? Or had they been going on for months when I begged him for the truth?\n\n\u201cMaybe even longer? I'll never know.\n\n\u201cIt bothers me to think I was lead on for so much longer than I was, which was already too long to begin with.\"\n\nEmma has no idea how she will ever meet someone decent. Source: Pinterest\n\n\"He gave her everything he promised me\"\n\nEmma is left looking for a way to start again \u2013 armed with the knowledge that even your childhood best friend is capable of cheating.\n\n\u201cWill I EVER be able to marry without being cheated on first?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cIt's like either they cheat and get mad at you for getting mad at them.\n\n\u201cOr they cheat, you get mad and leave, so they find someone else more forgiving.\n\n\u201cAnd give them everything they promised you.\u201d\n\nWe're pretty convinced that Emma's ex's relationship will end like this. Source: Pinterest\n\n\"They will never work\"\n\nCommenters were quick to reassure Emma that her ex\u2019s engagement won\u2019t work \u2013 regardless of how long he had secretly been seeing the other woman.\n\n\u201cI see the name and the ring as the equivalent of getting a set of steak knives in a game show,\u201d one man said.\n\n\u201cYeah, they will never work,\u201d another added.\n\n\u201cAllow me to be the first to introduce you to the term... narcissist,\u201d a woman said.\n\n\u201cNo normal person gets engaged in a month. Sorry, don't come at me with your anecdotes. You simply do not know anything about a person in that amount of time.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoesn't it look like a desperate attempt to hold together something that's clearly falling apart?\u201d a woman questioned.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing to be jealous of, they're making a mess and luckily you're not a part of it.\u201d", "description": "\u201cHe continued to deny it - until I used my sneaky fake Facebook to look up his profile.\"", "authors": ["Madeline Cox"], "top_image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/cb117902b4121a796050c61b88c5164e", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
