He's a really good guy, really fast, really talented,\" added the Frenchman of the 31-year-old reigning champion in Japan's Super Formula and Super GT series.\n\nThe thousands of spectators lining the circuit had plenty of chance to see their hero as he completed 30 laps -- more than any other driver -- and finished 17th fastest in the session.", "description": "Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas was quickest in practice before the Japanese Grand Prix locked down ahead of an approaching super typhoon, finishing a tenth of a second ahead of Lewis Hamilton.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9218/5ce699b143fe4888a83e167179928647.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
