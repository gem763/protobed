It's crucial that this vision held by most Argentines has been ratified with this sentence,\" said\n\nEduardo Jozami, human rights activist.\n\nAstiz's nickname comes from his cherubic looks and for his work delivering dissidents to the military junta as an undercover agent.\n\nIn total, 48 people were convicted of charges including kidnapping, torture, homicide and the stealing of minors.\n\nHuman rights groups estimate some 30,000 people were killed or disappeared during the brutal dictatorship.", "description": "Alfredo Astiz, known as the \"Angel of Death\" has been jailed for life for torture and murder during Argentina's military dictatorship", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/01/95/59/1000x563_story-597ec7ec-5b4a-5171-8408-b2b6cbb75b42_243396.jpg", "published_at": "2017-11-30"}
