Photo: John Minchillo\n\nAt Tuesday\u2019s Democratic primary debate in Ohio, moderator Anderson Cooper asked Juli\u00e1n Castro how he\u2019d end gun violence. Until then, the solutions put forth by his fellow candidates had focused mostly on implementing universal background checks, buying back some assault rifles, confiscating others, and banning their future sales. That most firearm deaths in America are caused by handguns went unmentioned. \u201cWhat\u2019s your plan to prevent those guns?\u201d Cooper asked Castro. The former Housing secretary instead challenged the question\u2019s premise, outlining the dangers of having police go door-to-door looking for weapons at all. \u201cIn the places I grew up in, we weren\u2019t exactly looking for another reason for cops to come banging on the door,\u201d Castro replied. He continued:\n\nAnd y\u2019all saw a couple days ago what happened to Atatiana Jefferson in Fort Worth. A cop showed up at 2 in the morning at her house when she was playing video games with her nephew. He didn\u2019t even announce himself. And within four seconds he shot her and killed her through her home window. She was in her own home. And so I\u2019m not gonna give these police officers another reason to go door-to-door in certain communities, because police violence is also gun violence, and we need to address that.\n\nCastro drew attention to an under-examined aspect of the gun-violence debate: That too often, gun-control efforts seek intervention from the state, often using force, to prevent violence between civilians without challenging the state\u2019s ability to use the same violence against them. This dynamic is vivified by cases like Jefferson\u2019s, one of dozens of people killed each year by law enforcement \u2014 a disproportionate share of them black \u2014 who don\u2019t even need guns to be viewed as threats. Jefferson was the second black person in the Dallas area whose killing at the hands of police made headlines in recent weeks. Earlier this month, former Dallas officer Amber Guyger was sentenced to ten years in prison for killing Botham Jean, her black neighbor, in his own apartment last year, after she walked in thinking it was hers and that he was a burglar.\n\nAmerican police officers regularly kill upwards of 900 people each year. The impunity with which they do so \u2014 the frequent lack of legal consequences, the regularity with which they lie to exaggerate the magnitude of an alleged threat and evade the perception of wrongdoing \u2014 raises the bigger question of whether they should suddenly be the only people carrying guns. The consequences of such an arrangement have already been felt, in many ways, by America\u2019s black, Latino, and indigenous residents, whose relationship to law enforcement has long been defined by brutal antagonism and forcible control over their movement. Castro\u2019s implied message is that white people can reasonably expect a buyback or confiscation program to unfold peacefully. But for black and brown people, there\u2019s good reason to fear it will end with many of them dead.\n\nCastro has made policing reform a centerpiece of his struggling campaign, including restricting the use of deadly force and making it easier to prosecute officers for misconduct. At multiple junctures, he\u2019s invoked the names of black and Latino people killed by law enforcement to illustrate the need for such a plan, which he touts as the only one of its kind in the entire 2020 Democratic field. He speaks more specifically than practically any other candidate to the unique concerns informing how nonwhite people experience the criminal-justice system \u2014 a by-product, he says, of his own experiences growing up in Texas neighborhoods where gun violence coexisted alongside police harassment. That he\u2019s currently polling around one percent nationally belies the value of this perspective. It\u2019s easy to imagine Tuesday\u2019s debate without it, and the prospect of police knocking down black, Latino, and indigenous families\u2019 doors en route to a monopoly on gun ownership going largely unquestioned.", "description": "Juli\u00e1n Castro answered a 2020 Democratic primary debate question about gun buybacks by invoking Atatiana Jefferson, killed by Fort Worth police, to illustrate the perils of having police march through black and brown communities looking for guns.", "authors": ["Zak Cheney-Rice"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/16/16-castro.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
