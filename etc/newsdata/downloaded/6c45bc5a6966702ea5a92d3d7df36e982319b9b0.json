Lloyd Russell-Moyle tried to block the Speaker by lying across him momentarily to stop him leaving to the House of Lords in the official ceremony to prorogue parliament. Other Labour colleagues, including the shadow women and equalities minister, Dawn Butler, and the backbencher Clive Lewis held up posters that read \u201csilenced\u201d.\n\nAs Russell-Moyle was pushed away by a member of Commons staff, the Green party leader, Caroline Lucas, was seen to tumble as MPs still sat in the chamber in the early hours of this morning started heckling and shouting.\n\nLewis tweeted that the group of MPs had been trying to re-enact an event from 1629 when the Speaker was pinned to his chair to prevent the prorogation of parliament.\n\nBoris Johnson loses sixth vote in six days as election bid fails Read more\n\nCries of \u201cshame on you\u201d rose from the opposition benches as government MPs left the chamber. Labour MPs, who remained in their seats after government MPs and the Speaker had left to attend the House of Lords, sang the Red Flag, SNP MPs Scots Wha hae and Plaid Cymru MPs Bread of Heaven.\n\nRussell-Moyle, the MP for Brighton Kemptown, is no stranger to parliamentary stunts. In December 2018, he grabbed the ceremonial mace after Theresa May postponed a key Brexit debate and vote on her withdrawal bill to the new year.\n\nThe chaos unfolded in the early hours of Tuesday morning, after a day of high drama in which Boris Johnson lost his sixth parliamentary vote in as many days and Bercow announced his impending retirement as Speaker.\n\nAnna McMorrin MP \ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc77\udb40\udc6c\udb40\udc73\udb40\udc7f\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa (@AnnaMcMorrin) Democracy shut down. Parliament silenced. #shameful pic.twitter.com/yqSB9tI2Sc\n\nAs the prorogation got underway, Bercow expressed his anger, saying it was \u201cnot a normal prorogation\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is not typical. It is not standard. It\u2019s one of the longest for decades and it represents, not just in the minds of many colleagues, but huge numbers of people outside, an act of executive fiat,\u201d he said.\n\nAs Bercow spoke, opposition MPs held signs reading \u201csilenced\u201d and some attempted to block his way.\n\nOne of those involved in the protest, Alex Sobel, Labour MP for Leeds North West, said the action \u201cechoes the action of members to try and prevent the speaker proroguing at the request of Charles I\u201d, referring to an incident in 1629 when MPs, furious at the closure of parliament left their seats and sat on the Speaker, preventing him from rising and closing the house, allowing MPs to pass a number of motions condemning the king.\n\nBercow was not sat on, and was soon allowed to pass through the House to attend the House of Lords. As he did so, he was followed by Conservative MPs, though Labour and other opposition MPs remained seated in the chamber and booed government MPs as they exited, chanting \u201cShame on you!\u201d\n\nWhile Bercow completed the formalities required to prorogue parliament in the House of Lords, opposition MPs sung songs, including the Red Flag, Jerusalem, Scots Wha Hae and Bread of Heaven (in Welsh, with harmonies).\n\nHannah Bardell \ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc73\udb40\udc63\udb40\udc74\udb40\udc7f\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 (@HannahB4LiviMP) The Welsh members also gave us a beautiful song.

Grieve said he had information from public officials that such correspondence contained a \u201cscandal\u201d.\n\nBut Downing Street sources suggested Johnson\u2019s advisers would resort to legal action rather than hand over their communications. Any refusal to comply could put them and the government in contempt of parliament.", "description": "Five-week suspension begins with shouts, singing and signs reading \u2018silenced\u2019", "authors": ["Kate Lyons", "Kate Proctor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f6cacd2d2df115c38dfdf99d679fb1333b1948c/96_78_883_530/master/883.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c5502af04f433974f30b9ebde532fe61", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
