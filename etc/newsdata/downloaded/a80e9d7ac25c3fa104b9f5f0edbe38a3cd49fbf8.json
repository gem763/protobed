Searches are going on.\"\n\nAnother account from police said only \"minor injuries\" had been reported.\n\nThe blast took place near a government office, a police official told Reuters on condition of anonymity, because he was not authorized to speak to media.\n\nIf confirmed, that would appear to mark the first attack near a government office since India's crackdown on the region.\n\nIndia's home ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's government says the scrapping of Jammu and Kashmir state's special status was necessary to integrate it fully into the rest of India and spur development.\n\nCritics say the decision to revoke autonomy will fuel further alienation and armed resistance.\n\nKashmir is divided between India and Pakistan, who both claim the territory in full. More than 40,000 people have been killed in an insurgency in the Indian part of Kashmir since 1989.
