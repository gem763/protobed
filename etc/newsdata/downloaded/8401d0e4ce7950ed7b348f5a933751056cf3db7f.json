Just don\u2019t. Aside from the mentions of daddy was a lot of \u2018ripped\u2019 comparisons. And some great food puns.\n\nOne applauded his fitness, as a fan wrote: \u2018Looking shredded mate.\u2019\n\nAnother joker chimed in: \u2018When u realize the chef is the REAL meal.\u2019\n\nWant another? One follower was loving the cooking puns as they replied: \u2018Gordon out here looking more shredded than the meat he slices.\u2019\n\nIt comes after the celebrity chef admitted he fainted during the recent birth of son Oscar.\n\nHe welcomed another kid (Picture: @gordongram)\n\nThe Kitchen Nightmares star appeared on The Jonathan Ross Show and revealed that wife Tana wouldn\u2019t allow him to be in the room at the births of his four other children, but this time she made an exception.\n\n\u2018Tana didn\u2019t want to see me there for previous births,\u2019 he told Wossy. \u2018She said, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to see me in this state so get out.\u201d This time I was there and I absolutely crapped my pants.\u2019\n\nThe chef confessed the experience was just too much for him and he collapsed upon watching his wife give birth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I fainted,\u2019 he continued. \u2018I literally dropped on the floor. I was sat there and Oscar popped out through the sunroof and then they sort of throw you on him and he\u2019s screaming and I fell back, the nurse grabbed me.\u2019\n\nWe hazard a guess a fair few fans have been hitting the floor due to lack of oxygen as they try to catch their breath looking at this throwback\u2026\n\nGot a showbiz story?
