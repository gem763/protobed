Still, it\u2019s unbelievable how many companies screw this up, like Twitter did earlier this month.\n\nThe social media platform recently disclosed it \u201caccidentally\u201d used email addresses and phone numbers provided for account security purposes to target ads.\n\n2FA can be implemented with SMS (the weakest way), an authenticator app, biometrics, or even a hardware security key that you plug into your device to sign-in to, say, a service like Google.\n\nBut Twitter\u2019s egregious use of this information explicitly meant for one thing for something else entirely is not only a clear-cut case of a privacy violation, they also made phone numbers mandatory, even if you want to use an authenticator app for verification.\n\nSo, deleting a phone number from your Twitter settings all but withdraws your account from Twitter 2FA. Other major sites, including Google, Facebook, and GitHub, don\u2019t make this a prerequisite.\n\nCybersecurity expert Matthew Green summed up this fuck up pretty well:\n\nIn all seriousness: whose idea was it to use a valuable advertising identifier as an input to a security system. This is like using raw meat to secure your tent against bears. \u2014 Matthew Green (@matthew_d_green) October 8, 2019\n\nOof!\n\nThe sooner Twitter decouples the phone number requirement from 2FA, the better.\n\nNow, onto more security news.\n\nWhat\u2019s trending in security?\n\nMotherboard\u2019s Joseph Cox wrote about MPC, a phone company run by drug traffickers that sells custom-engineered phones capable of sending encrypted emails and messages. [Motherboard]\n\nPlanting spy chips inside hardware equipment can cost as little as $200. But don\u2019t get any ideas\u2026 [Wired]\n\nESET researchers discovered an advanced malware strain \u2014 dubbed \u201cAttor\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s been deployed to spy on diplomats and Russian-speaking users in Eastern Europe. [ESET]\n\nA hacking group named \u201cFIN7\u201d is back on the scene after a short period of no activity. They\u2019re now packing new evasion techniques to thwart traditional antivirus detection. [FireEye]\n\nThe researchers over at McAfee concluded their deep dive that links the Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware \u2014 the same strain that was behind the coordinated Texas cyberattacks \u2014 to GandCrab, detailing their business model. [McAfee Labs]\n\ncoordinated Texas cyberattacks \u2014 to GandCrab, detailing their business model. [McAfee Labs] The Magecart cybercrime syndicate has been linked to Dridex \u2014 a banking Trojan that\u2019s been employed in the theft of online banking credentials \u2014 and a threat group known as Carbanak. [MalwareBytes]\n\nAdware shows no signs of slowing down. Snaptube, a popular video downloader app for Android, was caught generating fake ad clicks and unauthorized premium purchases that users were forced to pay for. The app\u2019s developer, Mobiuspace, blamed a third-party, called Mango SDK, for the fraudulent subscriptions and ad clicks. [Secure-D]\n\nPopular Android browser UC Browser has been downloading a third-party App Store app called 9Apps to devices over unsecured channels. [Zscaler ThreatLabZ]\n\nThis new Mac \u201cTarmac\u201d malware targets users via online malvertising (malicious advertising, get it?) campaigns that gather info about a victim\u2019s hardware setup and send the details to a remote server. [ZDNet]\n\nPrivate equity firm Thoma Bravo intends to buy cybersecurity firm Sophos in a $3.9B deal, adding to its portfolio which already has McAfee, Barracuda Networks, Veracode, Imperva, and ConnectWise. [Sophos]\n\nThere is a new kind of \u201cjackpotting\u201d malware attack that make ATMs eject all of the money inside them. [Motherboard]\n\nIt\u2019s India vs. WhatsApp: the government and Facebook-owned messaging platform are arguing over decrypting private messages for national security reasons. [Reuters]\n\nAttackers are banking on users\u2019 trust in privacy and security related apps to install malware. In the latest instance, the malware disguised itself as Tor browser to collect some $40K in Bitcoin from Russian-speaking victims on the dark web. [ESET]\n\nCozy Bear sounds cute, but it\u2019s not: this Kremlin-backed hacking group suspected of breaching the Democratic National Committee ahead of the 2016 US elections, has evolved its tactics with new spyware in a campaign ESET calls \u2018Operation Ghost\u2019 targeting high-value victims in 3 different countries in Europe. [ESET]\n\nResearchers demonstrated a new way third-party apps on Echo and Google Home smart speakers can surreptitiously eavesdrop on users and phish for their passwords. It exploits a flaw in both Alexa and Google Home that renders the devices silent upon encountering the character \u201c\ufffd\u201d (U+D801, dot, space), making it seem like they had terminated while the apps were still running. [SR Labs]\n\nData Point\n\nA survey \u2014 commissioned by HP as part of National Cybersecurity Awareness Month \u2014 has found that more than 70% of people across the US, UK, and Canada feel inevitable that their personal information will be compromised at least once in their life, with over 75% polled acknowledging it\u2019s only going to get harder to protect their information.\n\nHP Creepers and Peekers Study (HP)\n\nTakeaway: Have to say, this is one helluva depressing statistic. We\u2019ve reached a point where most of us have simply learned to accept data breaches as a fact of life, and move on. This desensitization sets a scary precedent because it reduces the pressure on organizations that handle our private data to do better.\n\nTweet of the week\n\nToday the @nytimes chose to eliminate my role, stating that there is no need for a dedicated focus on newsroom and journalistic security. I strongly believe in what I do (and what we did), and to say I\u2019m disappointed would be an understatement. (1/3) \u2014 Runa Sandvik (@runasand) October 22, 2019\n\nI\u2019m grateful for the 3.5 years of collaboration and helping support brilliant journalists; it\u2019s been amazing and exciting; I remain a fierce advocate for the mission of protecting reporters & sources, and I\u2019m very disappointed to see this chapter brought to a sudden close. (2/3) \u2014 Runa Sandvik (@runasand) October 22, 2019\n\nI\u2019ve already had an outpouring of questions and support \u2013 thank you! I\u2019m going to take a little time off, and then look for how and where I can provide the greatest impact to help people see and hear the stories which need to be told, without compromising sources.

I use 1Password and every single password I use these days is randomly generated and stored securely. It\u2019s the single best thing consumers can do to improve their security, plus it actually makes things easier as it\u2019ll autofill logins on both my PC and mobile devices. It\u2019s a win-win.\n\nThat\u2019s it. See you all in two weeks. Stay safe!\n\nRavie x TNW (ravie@thenextweb.com)\n\n[Enjoyed this newsletter?
