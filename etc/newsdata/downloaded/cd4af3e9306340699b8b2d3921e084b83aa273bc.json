The Message in Earth, Wind & Fire\u2019s \u2018September\u2019", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-03", "text": "Earth, Wind & Fire in the \u201970s, with the group\u2019s leader Maurice White, center, and his brother Verdine White, right, in red. Al McKay, at far left in blue, wrote the music for \u2018September.\u2019\n\nAt the peak of their popularity in 1978, Earth, Wind & Fire needed a new single to include on its first album of greatest hits. \u201cSeptember\u201d was written to help drive album sales.\n\nReleased as a single in November 1978, \u201cSeptember\u201d reached No. 8 on Billboard\u2019s pop chart and No. 1 on its R&B chart.\n\nRecently, lyricist Allee Willis talked about \u201cSeptember\u2019s\u201d evolution, along with bassist Verdine White, brother of the group\u2019s late leader Maurice White, and his widow, Marilyn White. Ms. Willis \u2019s song credits include the \u201cFriends\u201d theme \u201cI\u2019ll be There for You\u201d and Broadway\u2019s \u201cThe Color Purple.\u201d Edited from interviews:\n\nAllee Willis : I grew up in Detroit in the early 1960s. Every Saturday, my parents dropped me off at Motown\u2019s headquarters, a little house, to sit on the front lawn. You could hear the music leaking through the walls.\n\nThose are the only music lessons I ever took. To this day, I still don\u2019t know how to read, write or play music. I just hear everything in my head, the way I did outside Motown.\n\nIn 1969, I moved to New York and interviewed at Columbia Records. I started as a secretary and soon was promoted to junior copywriter.\n\nOne day, while listening to Gilbert O\u2019Sullivan \u2019s \u201cAlone Again (Naturally)\u201d on the radio, I wrote my own lyrics to the song. Then I called a friend to come over to my place to play piano and turn my lyrics into a song. He brought over the sheet music to the Jackson 5\u2019s \u201cNever Can Say Goodbye.\u201d\n\nLyricist Allee Willis and Maurice White in 1988.

That became my first song, \u201cAin\u2019t No Man Worth It.\u201d\n\nI wrote and sang two more songs by myself and took the three on a cassette tape to my boss in Columbia\u2019s advertising department. He loved them and took them to the head of Epic. I got signed to a record deal for the first 10 songs I ever wrote. We started recording my album \u201cChildstar\u201d in 1972, and it was released in 1974.\n\nDuring my tour to promote the album, I decided the easiest thing to do was to be a songwriter and avoid the trauma of the stage. Epic dropped me.\n\nIn March 1976, I moved out to Los Angeles and took my songs to more than 20 music publishers to try and get a job as a songwriter. Finally, A&M\u2019s Almo/Irving Music gave me a deal. In my first eight weeks, 11 of my songs were recorded by other artists. But even though I had a great publishing deal, I was living on food stamps.\n\nThen a friend introduced me to Verdine White, the bass player and a founding member of Earth, Wind & Fire. Verdine and I wrote two songs together for two different artists.\n\nVerdine kept saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to have my brother, Maurice, call you.\u201d I never thought that would happen because Earth, Wind & Fire was huge, and I was starving.\n\nVerdine White: When Earth, Wind & Fire began working on our next album, \u201cI Am\u201d in \u201978, Maurice needed someone to help him with song lyrics. I told him I had met a great lyricist.\n\nMs. Willis: One night my phone rang. Maurice was on the other end. He said, \u201cWould you write the next Earth, Wind & Fire album with me?\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\nThe next day I went to the space where Earth, Wind & Fire was rehearsing. Maurice came over and introduced himself. He handed me a sheet of notebook paper with a bunch of phrases he had written and the word \u201cSeptember\u201d hand-written at the top. Earth, Wind & Fire guitarist Al McKay wrote the music. It was for the greatest hits album coming out before \u201cI Am.\u201d\n\nMr. White : I had worked out the groove for the \u201cSeptember\u201d bass line on my Fender Jazz Bass. It wasn\u2019t called \u201cSeptember\u201d yet, and the lyrics hadn\u2019t been written. It was just a groove that Al McKay had put together that felt really good.\n\nEarth, Wind & Fire perform in February 1978: from left, Verdine White, Maurice White, Philip Bailey and Al McKay.

I asked him about the significance of the 21st of September from his lyric sheet. He said, \u201cI just like it.\u201d\n\nWhat bothered me most was the use of \u201cba-dee-ya.\u201d It sounded like filler. I said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to replace that with real words, right?\u201d He said he liked them the way they were.\n\nI also felt the other phrases were a little sing-songy. While they went with the happy feel of the music, they needed to be more intellectual.\n\nFor the first verse, Maurice had written down a bunch of disconnected lines: \u201cDo you remember, the 21st night, September / We were holding hands / Remember there was never a cloudy day / Our hearts were ringing with our souls in tune to singing.\u201d\n\nI turned them into:\n\n\u201cDo you remember, the 21st night of September? / Love was changing the minds of pretenders / While chasing the clouds away.\n\n\u201cOur hearts were ringing / In the key that our souls were singing / As we danced in the night, remember / How the stars stole the night away.\u201d\n\nFor the second verse, Maurice had written: \u201cRemember there was never a cloudy day / I want to be with you / shaping all of my time to be with you / Our life was a rhyme / remember there\u2019s never a cloudy day.\u201d\n\nI turned these phrases into:\n\n\u201cMy thoughts are with you / Holding hands with your heart, to see you / Only blue talk and love / Remember, how we knew love was here to stay.\n\n\u201cNow December, found the love we shared in September / Only blue talk and love / Remember, the true love we share today.\u201d\n\nWhat still bothered me was that \u201cba-dee-ya\u201d appeared over 20 times in the song and kicked off each chorus. On the last night of recording, with \u201cSeptember\u201d due at midnight, I went into the studio, dropped to my knees and grabbed Maurice\u2019s thighs. I begged him to replace \u201cba-dee-ya\u201d with real words. \u201cBa-dee-ya\u201d remained.\n\nBut I learned the best lesson of my career that night. Never let the lyric get in the way of the groove. If the beat is there, the melody is there and everything is working about the song, people listening will get what \u201cba-dee-ya\u201d means.\n\nIt\u2019s funny, most people still don\u2019t know what is being sung there. The biggest guesses are \u201cparty on\u201d and \u201call and all.\u201d\n\nMaurice passed away in 2016. Two years later, I went to lunch in L.A. with his wife, Marilyn. Someone in the restaurant recognized me and came over and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the significance of the 21st of September?\u201d\n\nI told him what I had been saying for 40 years: \u201cThere is no significance. That date just sang the best.\u201d Marilyn stopped me.\n\nShe said, \u201cAre you kidding? The 21st was the day that our son, Kahbran, was supposed to be born.\u201d\n\nMaurice never told me that. For decades, I had been disappointing people whose birthdays or weddings were on the 21st of September. Now they know.\n\nMarilyn White: In the spring of 1978, after my doctor told me our child would likely be born on September 21st, I came home and told Maurice. He was so busy then, I had no idea if he\u2019d remember.\n\nBy July, I sensed we were having a boy. So we came up with a name\u2014Kahbran\u2014by adapting parts of the first and last name of Lebanese-American writer-poet-artist Khalil Gibran. Kahbran was born early, on Aug. 1.\n\nWhile Maurice was working with Allee on the lyrics to \u201cSeptember\u201d and recording the song, he never told me about his line, \u201cDo you remember, the 21st night of September?\u201d The first time I heard it was when he played me a tape of the finished song in our home studio, after Kahbran was born.\n\nMy whole body smiled. It was like a secret message between us and our son. I said, \u201cOh my God, you remembered.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Maurice said, \u201cYeah, I did.\u201d", "description": "The 21st day has special significance in the 1978 hit inspired by the group\u2019s founder Maurice White.
