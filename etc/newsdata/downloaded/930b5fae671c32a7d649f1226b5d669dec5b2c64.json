(Photo: Jack Rowand/The CW)\n\nArrow is preparing to wrap up after eight seasons on the CW, but it may not be the end for some of its supporting characters, according to a new, not entirely surprising report of a potential spin-off series waiting in the wings.\n\nEntertainment Weekly broke the news about the project, which it describes as \u201cfemale-centric.\u201d Here are the details on which characters could return from Arrow:\n\nThe potential show will be introduced via a backdoor pilot in Arrow\u2019s eighth and final season and would star Katherine McNamara as Mia Smoak/Green Arrow, and Katie Cassidy Rodgers (Laurel Lance) and Juliana Harkavy (Dinah Drake) as the Canaries.\n\nAn interesting group that makes it sound a lot like another spin at the Birds of Prey. The story speculates that the series would be set in the future \u2014 meaning the Canaries would have to stay in old-age makeup \u2014 and confirms that the same team behind Arrow would, unsurprisingly, also be involved:\n\nArrow showrunner/executive producer Beth Schwartz will co-write the episode with Arrow\u2018s Marc Guggenheim, Jill Blankenship, and Oscar Balderrama. All four them will serve as EPs on the potential, which will be executive produced by Arrowverse architect Greg Berlanti and Sarah Schechter, and produced by produced by Berlanti Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television.\n\nIt seems likely that any official announcements regarding the spin-off won\u2019t arrive until later this fall, as the main show remains the focus in its final hours and new Arrowverse series Batwoman debuts.\n\nArrow season eight hits the FOX 8 on October 16.", "description": "Arrow is preparing to wrap up after eight seasons on the CW, but it may not be the end for some of its supporting characters, according to a new, not entirely surprising report of a potential spin-off series waiting in the wings....", "authors": ["Heather Alexandra", "Alex Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/s1d8mjjnwxnjbygwjmho.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
