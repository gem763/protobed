In addition, human breast milk did not inhibit the growth of Enterococcus faecalis, a beneficial bacteria.\n\nThe researchers also found that when they removed the GML from human breast milk, it lost its antimicrobial activity, and when GML was restored to the breast milk, it became antimicrobial once again. Cow's milk also became antimicrobial when GML was added to it.\n\nThe researchers also showed that GML inhibits inflammation in epithelial cells, which are the cells which line the gut and other surfaces; this is an important finding as inflammation can damage epithelial cells and increase the risk of bacterial and viral infections.\n\n\"Our findings demonstrate that high levels of GML are unique to human breast milk and strongly inhibit growth of pathogenic bacteria,\" said Donald Leung, MD, PhD, senior author on the paper.\n\n'While antibiotics can fight bacterial infections in infants, they kill the beneficial bacteria along with the pathogenic ones,\" said Patrick Schlievert, PhD, first author on the paper. \"GML is much more selective, fighting only the pathogenic bacteria while allowing beneficial species to thrive. We think GML holds great promise as a potential additive to cow's milk and infant formula that could promote the health of babies around the world.\"\n\nThe researchers note that GML is inexpensive to manufacture, and Drs. Schlievert and Leung have now applied for a patent for the use of GML as a beneficial additive to cow's milk and infant formula.", "description": "A new US study has identified a compound in human breast milk which can fight infections caused by harmful bacteria -- and which is not found in infant formula.
