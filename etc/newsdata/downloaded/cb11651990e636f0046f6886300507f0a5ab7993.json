It was nothing like that before the All Blacks faced Ireland in their Rugby World Cup quarterfinal.\n\nScattered green pockets of Irish fans in Tokyo Stadium were singing at the top of their lungs as the Ireland team stood arm-in-arm behind the halfway line facing the New Zealand players as they did their ceremonial pre-game dance.\n\nThe crowd of about 50,000 was also into it, singing or mesmerized by the Kiwis as the two-time defending World Cup champions went through their intimidating ritual.\n\n___\n\n6:10 p.m.\n\nEngland reached the Rugby World Cups semifinals for the first time in 12 years by beating Australia 40-16 for a record-tying win over its bitter rival.\n\nThe English outscored Australia by four tries to one in Oita to equal the 24-point margin of victory against Australia from November 2017 at Twickenham. England has now won this fixture a record-extending seven straight times.\n\nWinger Jonny May scored two tries in a three-minute span midway through the first half to put the English 14-3 ahead, a lead they never lost despite it being trimmed to one point soon after halftime by Australia winger Marika Koroibete\u2019s solo try from halfway.\n\nEngland prop Kyle Sinckler delivered a match-defining contribution, strolling over for a try in an immediate response to Koroibete\u2019s score and then turning over the ball on England\u2019s tryline under fierce pressure 10 minutes later.\n\nAnthony Watson added the fourth try from an intercept, and Owen Farrell\u2019s conversion gave him 20 points for the match with a flawless display from the kicking tee.\n\nThe Wallabies failed to reach the semifinals for only the third time in nine editions of the World Cup, and each of their quarterfinal losses have come against England.\n\nEngland will play either New Zealand or Ireland in Yokohama next Saturday.\n\n___\n\n5 p.m.\n\nJonny May scored two tries in three minutes to help England to a 17-9 lead over Australia at halftime in their Rugby World Cup quarterfinal match in Oita.\n\nAfter leading England out onto the field for his 50th cap, the winger went over in the left corner from close range in the 18th minute as England responded to Christian Lealiifano\u2019s 12th-minute penalty for the Wallabies.\n\nThen, England center Henry Slade collected an errant pass from David Pocock on England\u2019s 22, ran forward 40 meters, before executing a perfect grubber kick forward for May to gather on the run and find the left corner again.\n\nBoth tries were converted by flyhalf Owen Farrell, who also added a penalty in the 30th.\n\nLealiifano has kicked three penalties for the Australians, who lost to England at the quarterfinal stage in 1995 and 2007 - the only times they have failed to reach the last four.\n\nEngland is looking to reach the semifinals for the first time since 2007.\n\n___\n\n3:10 p.m.\n\nThere\u2019s a little over an hour to go until kickoff and England coach Eddie Jones is the first man out on the field at Oita Stadium. Dressed in a white shirt, he\u2019s all alone as he walks to the middle and has a moment to himself, looking all around the ground.\n\nIt will be a strange occasion for Jones, whose team is taking on the country where he was born. Jones was the Australia coach at the 2003 World Cup, when the Wallabies lost in the final to England.\n\nHe will also be going up against a former teammate from Sydney club Randwick, Michael Cheika, who is now Australia coach.\n\nJones, hired after England\u2019s shambolic performance at the 2015 World Cup on home soil, still has two years left on his contract with England. This could prove to be his final match in charge if his team loses, though, with the semifinals regarded as a minimum requirement for his employer, the Rugby Football Union.\n\nCheika is also likely to leave his post if Australia fails to get beyond the quarterfinals.\n\n___\n\n1:25 p.m.\n\nJapan\u2019s run to the Rugby World Cup quarterfinals is breaking broadcast audience records in the host nation.\n\nRugby World Cup organizers said Japan\u2019s win over Scotland in the last of the pool games last Sunday at Yokohama attracted 53.7% peak audience share for the host broadcaster, representing a 54.8 million audience, which was bigger than the audience for soccer\u2019s 2002 World Cup final in Yokohama on NHK.\n\nJapan\u2019s opening match against Russia attracted a peak audience of 26 million, the win over Ireland increased to a 29.5 million audience, and the closing stages of the win over Samoa attracted a peak of 47 million. The win over Scotland ensured Japan advanced to the knockout stage of the Rugby World Cup for the first time. The home team will play South Africa on Sunday in the quarterfinals.\n\nThere were 13 million views of the official Rugby World Cup 2019 Japanese language Twitter media account last Sunday, more than double the views of the English language account.\n\n___\n\n1 p.m.\n\nA bitter old rivalry and a relatively new one will feature in the Rugby World Cup quarterfinals on Saturday, when England and Australia meet in Oita and defending champion New Zealand takes on Ireland at Tokyo Stadium.\n\nAustralia and England have met six times at the Rugby World Cup, with each country winning three. The Australians beat England in the 1991 final at Twickenham, and the English avenged that with an extra-time win in the 2003 final in Sydney. That remains the only time a team from the northern hemisphere has won rugby\u2019s biggest prize.\n\nSince the Wallabies\u2019 33-13 win in 2015 contributed to England\u2019s pool-stage exit at the tournament it was hosting, Australian Eddie Jones has coached the England squad to six consecutive wins over Michael Cheika\u2019s Australians. England is favored to make that seven in a row.\n\nThe New Zealand All Blacks haven\u2019t lost a match at the Rugby World Cup since an upset quarterfinal defeat to France in 2007. The Irish have lost all seven knockout matches they\u2019ve played. But since breaking a 111-year drought with a victory over the All Blacks in 2016, Ireland is 2-1 in head-to-heads with New Zealand.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Latest on Saturday at the Rugby World Cup in Japan (all times local):", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
