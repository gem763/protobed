Since 1950, they have existed only on 2,000 large discs housed in wooden boxes in the International Court of Justice library in the Hague, Netherlands.\n\nNow, curious listeners will be able to listen to the entirety of the judicial proceedings in reading rooms at the Hague, the Shoah Memorial in Paris, and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.\n\nShoah Memorial head archivist Karen Taieb said she hopes the newly digitized audio files will allow researchers and students to better understand a powerful and emotionally fraught moment in history. Researchers previously had access to trial transcripts.\n\n\u201cYou can read the trial, but when you hear the trial, it\u2019s different,\u201d Taieb told The Associated Press. \u201cFor the victims, for example, it\u2019s different to hear their voices. The voices are very important, and the hesitation in them.\u201d\n\nThe trials, which took place from 1945 to 1949, marked a watershed moment in international law. They shed light on the extent of Nazi atrocities during the Holocaust and set new international precedents for defining and prosecuting war crimes.\n\nDuring the first and most famous trial, held between November 1945 and October 1946, an international panel of judges found 18 high-ranking Nazi leaders guilty on at least one count and sentenced 12 of them to death. Only 28 hours of the proceedings were filmed.\n\nFabien Theofilakis, a professor at the Sorbonne University who researchers the Holocaust, said the recordings will prove invaluable to historians.\n\n\u201cNow we would need these archives to have a real existence not only for researchers, but also for a broader public,\u201d he said.\n\nA day after the attack on a synagogue in the German city of Halle on Judaism\u2019s holiest day, Theofilakis stressed that this digital access will help ensure that the memory of the Holocaust can be sustained from one generation to the next.\n\n\u201cWe did a lot in Europe, in Germany, in France, to fight against antisemitism, to educate \u2026 Yet antisemitism increased in recent years,\u201d he stressed.\n\nFrench sound restoration firm Gecko was commissioned to digitize the audio. Project head Emiliano Flores said they kept the project secret to protect the fragile Nuremberg discs from neo-Nazis or zealous collectors.\n\n\u201cWe are extremely proud but also a bit relieved it is finished,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to the audio recordings, film clips presented as evidence of Nazi atrocities during the trial -as well as 250,000 pages of documents and some photos -will be available at the Shoah Memorial for public viewing, Taieb said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Audio recordings from the Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders will be made available to the public for the first time in digital form after nearly two years of work conducted in secret.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Claire Parker"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/10/france_nuremberg_trials_archives_42602_c0-127-2000-1293_s1770x1032.jpg?441cb7c2c9ce028fd36dde7087d4f024e6adb32f", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
