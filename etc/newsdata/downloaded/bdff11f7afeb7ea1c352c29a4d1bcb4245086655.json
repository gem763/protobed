Amnesty International said at least 111 children were arrested in the crackdown, \u201csome as young as 11, with several detained on their way home from school\u201d.\n\nMany were held by security services after they were stopped at checkpoints, where officials demanded to see their phones in order to check for \u201cpolitical\u201d material. Local rights groups as well as the government\u2019s own National Council for Human Rights condemned the practice as unconstitutional.\n\nDetainees were added to a single charge sheet, accused of aiding a terrorist group, spreading false information, misuse of social media and participation in unauthorised protests. Amnesty International said this included at least 69 minors aged between 11 and 17. Should the case go to trial, it would be the largest criminal prosecution of protesters in Egyptian history.\n\nHundreds of people gathered in rare protests against Sisi\u2019s leadership on 20 September, outraged by accusations that the country\u2019s ruling military was squandering public funds on palaces and hotels in a country where 32.5% of people live below the poverty line.\n\nThe detentions have touched people from almost every area of public life, from ordinary citizens to journalists and lawyers. The veteran activist Alaa Abd El-Fattah was re-arrested by the Egyptian national security agency from a Cairo police station, where he was forced to sleep as part of his parole. His lawyer, Mohamed El Baqir, was detained when he went to represent him.\n\nAbd El-Fattah\u2019s sister, the activist Sanaa Seif, was also briefly arrested on Sunday for refusing to allow security officials in central Cairo to search her phone.\n\nThe arrests even ensnared foreign visitors to Egypt, including two British and American university students who had come to Cairo to study Arabic, and were later accused of espionage.\n\n\u201cWe were stopped by a plain-clothes officer who asked to see our phones. I unlocked my phone and handed it to him. He went through every single social media app I had,\u201d said Aaron Boehm, a US citizen. The officer found news articles about the protests on Boehm\u2019s phone, and stopped the pair for over an hour while they read his messages. Boehm was arrested while his friend Ralph Shilcock was interrogated at the hostel where the pair were staying, and pressured into leaving the country.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Roads to Tahrir Square blocked by security forces to prevent anti-government protests in Cairo.

They gave two justifications. Firstly, that my sharing of news articles constituted sharing intelligence with a foreign state, and secondly that my working at an NGO was demonstrative of my intent to undermine the Egyptian regime.\u201d\n\nBoehm was detained for four days. At one point he was taken to a detention facility he believes held 300 others. During his imprisonment he met other foreign nationals including people from the Netherlands, Turkey, Jordan, Eritrea and Yemen, some of whom were later released. He stated that he saw evidence of torture used against detainees, including sticks with blood on them, and heard the screams of other inmates. When asked how many of those he saw in detention were accused of involvement in the protests, Boehm answered: \u201cEvery single one.\u201d He was deported on 1 October.\n\nThe cybersecurity firm CheckPoint reported this week it had uncovered evidence of a series of cyberattacks targeting critics of the Egyptian regime, including journalists, academics, layers and activists, as well as two opposition figures swept up in the crackdown. The report traced malware, which allowed attackers to track victims as well as read the contents of their phones, to Egyptian government offices.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Supporters of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi during a rally in Cairo.

He warned that any online calls to protest would be seen as evidence of \u201cillegal assembly\u201d.\n\nOther Egyptian officials scrambled to respond to the demonstrations. The MP Mostafa Bakri warned that the country should avoid \u201ca war against those who give their opinions\u201d. Ministers attacked the government, accusing it of not doing enough to protect the country\u2019s poor from harsh austerity measures.\n\nSisi has remained resolute, framing the uprising as fake news perpetrated by foreign powers to destabilise the country. \u201cThroughout the past decades, war has taken different shapes and forms until it now targets the people\u2019s morale, and enters citizens\u2019 houses through new media platforms,\u201d he said.", "description": "Security forces stop minors at checkpoints and check phones for \u2018political\u2019 material", "authors": ["Ruth Michaelson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b30defe718bcb9f9d4a8bb4ed37876ede0d864b4/18_328_2046_1227/master/2046.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=300c717af347d99d844c0b0572abeb2e", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
