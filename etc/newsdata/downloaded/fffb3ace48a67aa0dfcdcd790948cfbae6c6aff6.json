That call came as the U.S. had frozen nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe first part of that favor was for Zelensky to investigate a conspiracy theory that the Democratic National Committee servers hacked by Russia to benefit Trump\u2019s campaign in 2016 were not actually hacked. He also, like in the April call, pressured Zelensky to meet with Giuliani and speak with Attorney General William Barr to find dirt on Biden and his son Hunter Biden.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said earlier this week that Zelensky\u2019s administration was concerned that the U.S. was cutting off aid \u201cfor their unwillingness, at the time, to investigate the Bidens,\u201d citing his communication with Ukrainian officials, including Zelensky, when the senator visited the country this month, The Washington Post reported Monday.\n\nTrump said earlier this week that he had blocked the military aid because of concerns about corruption in Ukraine. But a Defense Department letter from May obtained by NPR said that Ukraine had taken \u201csubstantial actions\u201d to fight corruption and was subsequently cleared to receive the military aid, which had been blocked until Sept. 11.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s shadow diplomacy in Ukraine while Trump\u2019s personal attorney has frustrated some State Department officials who didn\u2019t know about his work there, the Post reported Tuesday.\n\nGiuliani has been working for months with current and former Ukrainian prosecutors to push for investigations he admitted would politically benefit Trump, the Times reported in a May interview.\n\nThe July 25 call was mentioned in a whistleblower complaint that came from inside the intelligence community, and the disclosure helped prompt Tuesday\u2019s announcement of a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump.", "description": "Trump called Volodymyr Zelensky in April to tell him to coordinate with personal attorney Rudy Giuliani on investigating \"corruption,\" The New York Times...", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8c1c1b1e00004b02726585.jpeg?cache=wfqynamfrv&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
