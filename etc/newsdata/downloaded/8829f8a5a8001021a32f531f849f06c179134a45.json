(You can see my own failed attempt at prognostication myself in the notes. I originally had it screen-shotted with a timestamp in case I was right, but there\u2019s really no reason for me to brag about such a humiliating line of thought now.) Creator Jesse Armstrong, who wrote the final episode, has crafted an ending that makes you believe, in retrospect, that it could go no other way, because that\u2019s what great writers do. It had to be Kendall and Kendall had to react as he did, because the entire arc of the show makes any other choice seem as inadequate as offering Tom with \u201cGreg sprinkles.\u201d\n\nThe finale pays off a long game between Kendall and his father that goes all the way back to the early episodes of the first season. Since the incident at Shiv\u2019s wedding, Kendall has been so tragically intent on showing fealty to his father that we forget how much time he\u2019s spent trying to plunge the dagger. He seems to have known for the longest time that Logan would never choose him to run the company\u2014he\u2019s a fuck-up, yes, but tonight he\u2019s also said to be \u201cnot a killer\u201d\u2014so he\u2019s tried on multiple occasions to take it from him outright. He tried to arrange a show of no confidence and that blew up in his face. Then he tried to lead the proxy bid with Stewy and Sandy and that also blew up after he staged his own version of Chappaquiddick. And yet that killer instinct never left him, much as it was suppressed by shame and depression, not to mention all the cocaine and liquor (and meth) he could find to numb his conscience and salve his pain.\n\nArmstrong conceives a beautiful symmetry between the opening and closing sequences of the second season: In the first episode, Kendall is dragged out of a peaceful Icelandic hideaway to sacrifice himself for his company, making it clear to whoever\u2019s listening that he\u2019s looked at both deals and backs his father\u2019s position in the proxy fight. In the last, he\u2019s asked to take one hard on the chin a second time and admit that he was solely responsible for overseeing the horrors of the cruises division and covering it up through payoffs and document destruction. Witnessing Kendall\u2019s presser in \u201cThis Is Not for Tears\u201d is like watching him emerge from the chrysalis, ready to claim some of the dignity and power that seemed lost to him forever. Yet it\u2019s also the rousing payoff to a lifetime of mistreatment at the hands of his father, who\u2019s the source of everything wrong in his life, and that all the money in the world can\u2019t fix. \u201cThe truth is that my father is a malignant presence,\u201d he says\u2014and in an environment where everyone lies routinely, that\u2019s a plain fact.\n\nThere are many superbly wrought scenes in this episode that lay the path for that ending, but the one that sticks out to me now is the lighter one between Kendall, Shiv, and Roman on the yacht before the anticipated kiss from daddy. Kendall is back to floating on peaceful waters, recalling that Icelandic spa from which he was pulled like a child from the womb. The three siblings \u2014 and sorry, Connor, you\u2019re not really in the mix here \u2014 are talking about Roman\u2019s trip and various bits of company intrigue, but what\u2019s striking about the scene is how relaxed they are together. It\u2019s possible to imagine what they would be like without their father poisoning the well. Being filthy rich on a yacht should be fun \u2014 like Greg going down the big slide fun \u2014 and the three of them are capable of silly sibling banter when they\u2019re not having to scheme at their father\u2019s behest. When Logan\u2019s chopper arrives (\u201cEmotional gunship incoming!\u201d), the sound permanently breaks the peace.\n\nWhat\u2019s particularly appalling and pathetic about Logan\u2019s performance on the yacht is that he\u2019s playing the same who-gets-sent-off-the-island game as everybody who\u2019s been watching the show. We\u2019ve all wanted to know from the start who the successor is because the show is called Succession, and Logan is our malevolent Jeff Probst, putting his contestants through the paces. But the reality is, he\u2019s the most craven of all the Roys, despite the \u201cempire of shit\u201d that he\u2019s been able to build up around himself. His answer to the problem is to manipulate his family into making the decision for him, which is how we end up with the miserable spectacle of a tableful of Roys and Waystar muckety-mucks talking openly about whose head to put on a spike. When Logan says \u201cthe obvious choice is me,\u201d he\u2019s serving his ego. He knows everyone at the table will use this opportunity to kiss his ass like the opening of a Trump cabinet meeting.\n\nKendall floats Gerri. Roman floats Frank. Frank floats Karl. Karl volleys back to Gerri. Roman stands up for Gerri (\u201cHaven\u2019t we killed enough woman already?\u201d) and throws it back to Tom. Shiv thinks Tom looks logical. Others think maybe Tom with Greg sprinkles. And Connor, hilariously, volunteers himself as Tribute. In just a few short minutes, relationships are poisoned (or further poisoned, anyway) for Logan\u2019s benefit, but he has to leave disappointed that none of these suggestions are adequate and someone much higher up the chain will have to go. He\u2019s waiting for the right person to make the suggestion \u2014 that person turns out to be Shiv \u2014 and it\u2019s only then he can kindly asks his number one son to take the fall. He has decided nothing. He has overseen disaster.\n\nIt takes some doing for Kendall to get where he needs to be, however, but it\u2019s also possible that he\u2019s planned for this contingency. At some point, for example, he would have had to have a conversation with Greg about the incriminating documents in his possession. That conversation probably happened some time after Logan booted Greg out of the room for panicking over Tom\u2019s Congressional testimony, but it seems likely that it was after Kendall was chosen as the fall guy. (Armstrong and company prepared so well for this team, incidentally, by having Kendall and Greg bond in significant ways this season over an apartment and park cocaine.)\n\nThe decisive scenes, to my mind, have to do with Naomi Pierce, who\u2019s been hanging around Kendall\u2019s life since their weekend at Tern Haven. Kendall didn\u2019t have daddy\u2019s permission to bring Naomi on board at such a sensitive time; Logan tells him, \u201cI\u2019m not sure we have enough provisions,\u201d and makes his objections even clearer when referencing their substance abuse problems. Kendall does what his father says, just as he did after sending the actress away for saying \u201cawesome\u201d twice when meeting Logan. But Naomi has an insight that shakes him: \u201cHe loves the broken you. That\u2019s what he loves.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019d think that all the king\u2019s horses and all the king\u2019s men couldn\u2019t put Kendall back together again. But for one astonishing moment, he summons the courage to do so himself.\n\nSad Sack Wasp Traps\n\n\u2022 [Note: This first bullet point was written about an hour before the show started] \u201cWho will be the blood sacrifice?\u201d It\u2019s shortly before the last episode of the season is about to air, so I\u2019ve decided to speculate in the dark and post it in \u201cSad Sack Wasp Traps\u201d to see how close I got. I\u2019m absolutely terrible at figuring such things out, but I\u2019m going to try now. Two scenarios: What won\u2019t happen (but seems like it will), and what will happen (but seems like a stretch).\n\nWhat won\u2019t happen: The obvious choice is Tom by way of Greg. Greg is expendable, a blood relative who\u2019s become the unofficial Roy family mascot without actually being part of the inner circle\u2014or even a satellite to the inner circle. (He\u2019s the \u201cAssistant to the Regional Manager\u201d of the show.) Greg\u2019s name has already come up in Congressional hearings for possibly destroying incriminating documents on Thanksgiving, but we know that Greg has taken steps to insulate himself by keeping copies of incriminating documents. That would naturally shift the blame to Tom, who\u2019s spent the season playing the patsy for Shiv, Logan, and everyone else who needs a scapegoat. But again, this won\u2019t happen because it\u2019s too straightforward.\n\nWhat will happen: Shiv is the blood sacrifice. It\u2019s not clear exactly how a woman so disconnected from Waystar\u2019s day-to-day operations could take the fall, but that\u2019s something for Jesse Armstrong to work out. But any show that recalls King Lear and other Shakespeare works so frequently has a respect for classical dramatic structure. And with Shiv beginning the season as The Chosen One, only to have her father (and her own missteps) undermine her at every turn, it follows that she would hit bottom at season\u2019s end. This will not be just, given the terrible task she performed so capably last week, but Logan doesn\u2019t care to make his children happy. He\u2019s looking out for No. 1.\n\n\u2022 What did happen: D\u2019oh! I\u2019m terrible at this.\n\n\u2022 I really hope there\u2019s a deleted scene with more of Greg\u2019s testimony, because his attempts at formal language (\u201cIf it is to be said\u2026 so it is,\u201d \u201cYes, I merely wish to answer in the affirmative action\u201d) are a delight.\n\n\u2022 In an episode where his father acts like a coward, Roman is able to come back to Logan and be honest about the prospect of his cokehead counterpart in Turkey saving the company. He would have stopped the blood sacrifice\u2014which potentially could have been his neck\u2014but he chose to give his honest assessment. And this in the face of his typical board-room sycophancy.\n\n\u2022There\u2019s so much going on in this episode that it\u2019s a shame to reserve what happened between Tom and Shiv for a bullet point, but here we are. In the same episode where a beaten-down Kendall showed some pride, Tom finally spoke up for himself with a firmness that\u2019s eluded him in his marriage to Shiv and his business dealings with the Roy family. Shiv\u2019s wish for an open relationship never sat right with him (\u201cI don\u2019t feel that naughty tonight\u201d) and her willingness to throw him off the plank in the name of pragmatism is the final straw. Matthew Macfadyen brings heartbreaking new inflections to his performance as Tom, especially in the scene with the two of them in a cove. \u201cI wonder,\u201d he says, \u201cif the sad I\u2019d be without you would be less than the sad I\u2019d be being with you.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Connor gets excited about his fist-pumping becoming a meme. (\u201cI\u2019m a JIF now!\u201d) But I\u2019m going to guess that Willa tossing his tablet off the yacht will be the truly long-lasting meme from this episode. We need something to replace the tired baboon laptop gif.\n\n\u2022 Speaking of memes, Tom eating Logan\u2019s chicken has a nice \u201cI drink your milkshake\u201d quality to it.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Is that a sly smile that crosses Logan\u2019s face in the final scene? Does game, at long last, recognize game? We\u2019ll find out next season.\n\nVULTURE NEWSLETTER Keep up with all the drama of your favorite shows!
