During a conversation about technology companies, for example, Sen. Kamala Harris of California tried to get Warren to say whether she would have President Trump banned from Twitter.\n\nWarren simply dismissed the question. \u201cI don\u2019t just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter. I want to push him out of the White House,\u201d she said, then simply proceeded to talk over Harris.\n\nThe progressive senator\u2019s new lead in polls remains tenuous at best, but most candidates understand perceptions matter more than crosstabs this early in a political contest. And the more Warren is perceived as a front runner, the more polls will reflect that she has indeed become one.\n\nHer impressive fundraising numbers will only make it easier to argue that even though the Iowa caucuses are still months away, she is creeping ever closer to the prized realm of inevitability.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (Photo: John Minchillo/AP) More\n\nTuesday night was largely about keeping Democratic voters from thinking there is anything inevitable about Warren\u2019s campaign. Her rivals tried to portray her ideas as unrealistic and unworkable. Implicit in their attacks was the abiding notion that Warren\u2019s policies are too far to the left to attract the moderate voters Democrats need to defeat Trump in next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nSome of the attacks appeared to be ploys by low-polling candidates hoping for a David-slays-Goliath moment. One such moment came relatively early on, when Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota called Warren\u2019s Medicare for All plan a \u201cpipe dream.\u201d\n\nWarren answered, a little later, that it was high time for Democrats to \u201cstand up\u201d to various profiteers in the health care industry. \u201cAnd if we don't have the guts to do that,\u201d she concluded, \u201cif all we can do is take their money, we should be ashamed of ourselves.\u201d\n\nThat the fight ahead was both difficult and necessary was a common refrain for Warren, and a kind of blanket defense against criticisms of her Medicare for All and wealth tax proposals. Regarding the latter, she explained that it was necessary to tax investment and inheritance, not merely income. \u201cLook, I understand that this is hard,\u201d Warren said, \u201cbut I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started.\u201d\n\nSouth Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has tried to draw a contrast between himself and Warren on health care and other issues, decried her thirst for \u201cinfinite partisan combat,\u201d which he suggested would not work in the Midwest.\n\nWith a dozen candidates on stage, it was hard for any one person to stand out. But 80 minutes into the debate, Warren had managed to do just that, with 22 minutes of speaking time. If that seems slight, consider that Joe Biden, the former vice president, was in second place with 16 minutes.\n\nBiden had until recently been leading in the polls. But his misstatements, as well as questions about his son Hunter\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine, have sapped the strength he had when he entered the campaign some months ago.\n\nIneffectual for much of the debate, Biden went after Warren\u2019s universal health care package, calling it \u201cvague.\u201d But the attack was itself vague, and culminated with Biden and Warren sparring over the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which Warren created despite some reluctance from the Obama administration.", "description": "For much of the fourth Democratic debate, there were effectively two people on the stage: Elizabeth Warren and everyone else.", "authors": ["Alexander Nazaryan", "National Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5g8jxiWdljnJdHNYo9N1.g--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/62de7c80-efc3-11e9-bfd8-1d8790da263c", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
