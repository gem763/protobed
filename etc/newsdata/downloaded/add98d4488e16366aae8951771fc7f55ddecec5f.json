MAGA-hatted Proud Boys wearing their trademark black-and-yellow Fred Perry polo shirts roamed the streets, shouting homophobic slurs and beating up protesters.\n\nHare and Kinsman were convicted in August on charges of rioting, attempted assault, and attempted gang assault in August.\n\nProsecutors had to rely on video footage of the violence to secure a conviction, because the four victims, who were masked, didn\u2019t testify or talk to police. Based on video, they concluded that Kinsman was the most violent of the group, and Hare threw the first punches.\n\nREAD: The U.S. doesn't prosecute far-right extremists as terrorists. Here's how it could.\n\nSurveillance and bystander video showed multiple Proud Boys brutalizing protesters and passersby. In one video, a Proud Boy is overheard bragging about kicking a \u201cforeigner\u201d in the head.\n\n\u201cThe defendants transformed a quiet, residential street into the site of a battle royale, kicking and beating four individuals in a brutal act of political violence,\" Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance said after their conviction in August.\n\nTen men in total connected to the Proud Boys were arrested in relation to the incident. Two of those men took plea deals and were given community services, one case is pending, and others who pleaded guilty have received sentences between 40 weekends and three months in prison.\n\nThe Proud Boys has been tied to violent clashes elsewhere in the U.S., including in Portland, Oregon. They describe their members as \u201cWestern chauvinists\u201d and have been classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, on account of their misogyny and white nationalist views.\n\nDisclosure: The Proud Boys organization was founded by Gavin McInnes, a co-founder of VICE Media. McInnes left VICE in 2008 and has not been involved in the company since.\n\nCover: Maxwell Hare, left, and John Kinsman, arrive at court, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 in New York.
