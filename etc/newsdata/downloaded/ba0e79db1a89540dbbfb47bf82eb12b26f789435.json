(Published Thursday, April 21, 2011)\n\nBut, police began investigating in January, after the Norwalk Housing Authority filed a complaint that McDowell had registered her son at Brookside Elementary School in Norwalk, even though she had been living in an apartment on Priscilla Street in Bridgeport.\n\nMcDowell admitted to police she was allowed to sleep in the apartment on Priscilla Street in Bridgeport by the tenant, but had to leave during the day, according to the Advocate. She also told police she sometimes stayed at an emergency shelter in Norwalk.\n\nPolice say McDowell used the Norwalk address of the boy's babysitter to register him at the school. After the investigation, the babysitter was evicted.\n\nWeird News Photos: Holiday Edition\n\n\"At the time, I was just staying in my van and not having anywhere to go,\" McDowell said.\n\nMcDowell\u2019s story hits home for Gwen Samuel, an unemployed parent from Meriden who is fighting for Tanya\u2019s son and other children who could easily get lost in this education shuffle.\n\n\u201cIt doesn't make any sense.

Paul Resnick said this is the first time he has heard of this happened.\n\n\"Usually when they find a kid out of district, they send him back. I have never heard of people being arrested for it,\" Norwalk Board of Education Chairman Jack Chiaramonte told the Advocate.\n\nThe apparent crackdown may have something to do with the city's tightening budget.\n\n\"This now sends a message to other parents that may have been living in other towns and registering their kids with phony addresses,\" Norwalk Mayor Richard Moccia said.\n\nMcDowell, whose last known address was in Bridgeport, is facing first-degree larceny and conspiracy to commit larceny charges, the paper reported.", "description": "A homeless and unemployed woman from Bridgeport has been arrested for enrolling her 5-year-old son at a Norwalk elementary school.\r\nTonya McDowell, 33, is accused of stealing $15,000 -- the cost of her...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.nbcconnecticut.com/images/1203*675/Tanya+McDowell.jpg", "published_at": "2011-04-17"}
