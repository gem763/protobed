PG&E drew widespread criticism after it abruptly shut off power for roughly 700,000 homes earlier this month in California after forecasts suggested a high risk of wildfires.\n\nThe decision caused confusion among customers, shut down traffic lights and impacted local business, prompting the California Public Utilities Commission to order PG&E executives to appear at an emergency meeting on Friday. At the meeting, Johnson disclosed that PG&E was still years away from sufficient upgrades to its grid.\n\n\u201cMaking the right decision on safety is not the same as executing that decision well,\u201d he said, according to the Wall Street Journal. \u201cPG&E has to be better prepared than it was this time.\u201d\n\nPG&E equipment was found responsible for a series of wildfires that caused billions of dollars of damage in California in recent years. The company filed for bankruptcy in January, citing an estimated $30 billion in wildfire liabilities.\n\nIn periods of high wind, falling trees or branches can cause downed power lines to spark fires.\n\nMarybel Batjer, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, ripped company executives for failing to provide adequate notice about the blackout. The company\u2019s website crashed as customers sought details on the situation.\n\n\"You guys failed on so many levels on pretty simple stuff,\" Batjer said.\n\nPG&E executives stressed that the decision to cut power was made with safety in mind. Johnson said the company will improve its preparedness procedures for future blackouts.\n\nPower was restored on Oct. 12, three days after it was initially cut.\n\nAuthorities ordered roughly 100,000 residents to evacuate last week. At least three deaths were linked to the wildfires.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "PG&E drew widespread criticism after it abruptly shut off power for roughly 700,000 homes earlier this month in California after forecasts suggested a high risk of wildfires.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Bill-Johnson.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
