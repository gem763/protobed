Those cases are in addition to an ongoing legal battle over its role in the US opioid addiction crisis.\n\nIn August, Johnson & Johnson was ordered to pay $572m after a judge in Oklahoma ruled that the company contributed to an opioid epidemic in the state by running a \"false and dangerous\" sales campaign. The firm said it will appeal.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nMore recently, it agreed a $20.4m settlement with two counties in Ohio ahead of a trial about the opioid crisis, scheduled to take place later this month.\n\nIn the Risperdal lawsuit, Mr Murray said he developed breasts after his doctors prescribed the drug in 2003 when they diagnosed him with autism spectrum disorder.\n\nRisperdal is approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but doctors can legally prescribe medicine for any condition they see fit.\n\nThe company said it is confident the ruling will be overturned, and said the court prevented their legal team from presenting \"key evidence\" on the drug's labelling.\n\nA jury in 2015 awarded Mr Murray $1.75m after finding the company was negligent in failing to warn consumers of the risks.\n\nA state appeals court upheld the verdict in last year, but reduced it to $680,000.", "description": "A US jury finds Johnson & Johnson guilty of negligence over an anti-psychotic drug.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C7D4/production/_109165115_drug2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
