The result was new life for the eye-turning Mercury, which 'certainly feels fast off a stoplight,' reports Jalopnik.\n\nThis 1949 Mercury had its gasoline engine swapped out for dual electric motors and a Tesla Performance 85kWh battery pack by boutique automaker John Ward and his shop Icon in Chatsworth, California\n\nThis 1949 Mercury in the illustration above shows the dual electric motors installed under the hood by boutique automaker John Ward and his shop Icon in Chatsworth, California\n\nOne of the dual electric motors Icon installed into a 1949 Mercury hot rod is pictured above\n\nWard replaced the Mercury's V8 with an electric powertrain with a 400 horse power rating. The batteries had to be installed throughout the vehicle to evenly distribute their weight, he said.\n\nThat however, made temperature control difficult, and required the installation of cooling systems. The vehicle also is lacking a transmission. 'What's the point, because, the ideal EV scenario, in my opinion, is transmission-less,' says Ward.\n\nDespite its electric power source, the Mercury still had all the nuances that collectors and hipsters want from a rusting, vintage speed machine.\n\nThat includes a 'swishy passenger seat' and 'all the right smells' as the vehicle was driven through industrial Chatsworth, reports Jalopnik.\n\nThe driving experience still included 'sun-heated steel from the dash; stretched leather; and even a vague tinge of nicotine on Ward's jacket.'\n\nThe 'desert rat-style' look of the 1949 Mercury is pictured above. It's the look that makes the hot rod a head-turner, especially with collectors. The only difference with the rebuild of this vehicle is what's under the hood\n\nA rusted, 'as-found' body was used, while the powertrain and suspension and chassis were custom-made.\n\nPictured above are the dual electric motors that boutique automaker John Ward and his shop Icon installed into this classic 1949 Mercury's in place of its V8 engine\n\nBatteries from a wrecked Tesla P85D had to be used since the power source is not available off the shelf. The batteries, pictured above, were installed around to distribute their weight proportionately, according to Ward.\n\nThe battery placement around the Mercury made temperature control complex. Fans pictured above are installed along with batteries in the vehicle's trunk\n\nThe chassis of the vehicle (pictured above) included 'oil-cooled motors.' They're back to back, I placed them where the tranny was,' says Ward, referring to the transmission\n\nWard's team on the Mercury included an electrical engineering consultant, who was brought on specifically to help decide on whether to include a new transmission\n\n'The end result is we're transmission-less,' says Ward. 'Which means more fun when you're driving, because now you have no shift points, no gears...'\n\n'When people think of EV conversions, including my dumb a--, 'well s--t it can't be that hard! just a motor, computer, and an energy source! It's easy!' Ward says, adding that in retrospect 'it ain't this'\n\nOnce Ward put the pedal to the medal, and in the absence of a gasoline engine, the Mercury 'warped toward the horizon like a hipster hillbilly spaceship.\n\nWard's Icon is known for rebuilding classic SUVs with an elegant makeover, and which go for six-figures.\n\n'Traditionally, I'm here to build s--t that should last you forever,' he tells Jalopink. 'This should, and still could.'\n\nWard finally driving the classic hot rod, and in the absence of a gasoline engine, 'warped toward the horizon like a hipster hillbilly spaceship.' The car is pictured above driving on its electric power source\n\nThe Mercury's rebuild, however, doesn't mean that such restorations are practical since battery technology is still evolving, and quickly. The car's electric recharging plug is show above\n\nWhile 'it's pretty cool,' battery technology is still evolving, and quickly.\n\n'If you want to stay up with the latest science, you may be coming back and hemorrhaging more money to evolve with the state of the tech,' Ward said.\n\n'When people think of EV conversions, including my dumb a--, 'well s--t it can't be that hard! just a motor, computer, and an energy source! It's easy!' Ward says, adding that in retrospect 'it ain't this.'", "description": "An eye-catching, art-deco, 1949 Mercury hot rod was given dual electric motors and a Tesla performance 85kWh battery pack, converting the beautiful classic into a modern, electric vehicle.", "authors": ["Ralph R.
