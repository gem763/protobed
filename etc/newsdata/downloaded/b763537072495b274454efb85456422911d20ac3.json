This one, he\u2019ll pitch a playoff game at Yankee Stadium.\n\nPretty nice little Saturday planned - two of them, actually - for an undrafted rookie who never expected to be in this position. Just find No. 68 of the Minnesota Twins on Twitter, where he mentions his 4.99/5 Uber driver rating.\n\nDobnak was a surprising choice by the Twins to start Game 2 of their AL Division Series against Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton and the powerful New York Yankees. The 24-year-old righty will make his postseason debut with Minnesota trailing 1-0 in the best-of-five series following a 10-4 defeat Friday night.\n\n\u201cMy parents are coming from Pittsburgh,\u201d Dobnak said. \u201cMy agent and his dad, I think they live here. And then my wife, her dad, her roommate and her brother are coming from Hedgesville, West Virginia. I think it\u2019s like five hours or so, not too bad.\n\n\u201cOnly eight people, nothing too crazy, but they\u2019re really looking forward to it. I\u2019m looking forward to it, having them there, just having them here to experience it all with me is pretty cool.\u201d\n\nIt will be Dobnak\u2019s first outing since leaving the team for a few days because of his nuptials last Saturday. He and his new wife, Aerial, set the date more than two years ago, never considering Dobnak might still be completing a big league season.\n\nAt a wedding reception with 250 guests, Dobnak walked in wearing the same large goggles he used to protect his eyes during the boozy clubhouse celebration after Minnesota clinched the AL Central title four days earlier. The maid of honor\u2019s speech ended with \u201cGo Twins!\u201d\n\nDobnak made his major league debut in August and was sensational in September, finishing the regular season 2-1 with a 1.59 ERA in nine appearances, including five starts. He struck out 23 and walked five in 28 1/3 innings.\n\nHe was picked for Game 2 over All-Star and eight-year veteran Jake Odorizzi (15-7, 3.51), who will start Game 3 instead.\n\n\u201cA fine line. It was not an obvious move in any way,\u201d first-year manager Rocco Baldelli said. \u201cI think in this ballpark, the guy that throws the ball, keeps it on the ground pretty well, was a good guy to look to. Dob\u2019s been throwing the ball great for us, so I thought it made sense.\u201d\n\nBaldelli didn\u2019t announce the decision until after the series opener.\n\n\u201cI wanted to make sure we got through tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were set to name these guys anyway. So that\u2019s what our plan was originally, too.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum and AP Sports Writer Jake Seiner contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Last weekend, Randy Dobnak got married in Maryland.
