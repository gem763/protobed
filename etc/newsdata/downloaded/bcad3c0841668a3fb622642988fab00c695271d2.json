REUTERS/Thilo Schmuelgen/File Photo\n\nMetro said on Friday the deal, which confirms an earlier Reuters story, gave the Chinese unit an enterprise value of 1.9 billion euros ($2.1 billion) and that the German group would retain a 20% stake in a joint venture called Metro Wumart China.\n\nMetro expects to receive proceeds of 1 billion euros from the stake sale, which Chief Executive Olaf Koch said could be used to fund acquisitions, without elaborating.\n\nOnce a sprawling retail conglomerate, Metro has in recent years been restructuring to focus on its European cash and carry business supplying hotels, restaurants and cafes.\n\nIt has sold off Kaufhof department stores, split from consumer electronics group Ceconomy CECG.DE and is in talks to sell its loss-making REAL hypermarkets.\n\nKoch said Metro had an option to sell its 20% stake in the new Chinese joint venture in two years.\n\nMetro\u2019s Chinese operations include 97 stores and real estate assets in major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai.\n\nThe business made earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of 153 million euros in fiscal 2017-18.\n\nBut wholesalers and retailers alike in China are facing intense competition from online operators.\n\nMetro said its involvement in the joint venture would allow it to explore various strategic partnership opportunities with Wumart\u2019s parent Wumei and its technology partner Dmall, \u201cparticularly in terms of international sourcing of goods.\u201d\n\nKoch said on a conference call he was also confident that Metro would sell its REAL business.\n\nEarlier on Friday, Reuters reported that Wumart Stores had emerged as the frontrunner to buy a majority stake in Metro\u2019s Chinese business, citing sources familiar with the auction.\n\nMetro said the deal was subject to regulatory approvals and was expected to close by the second quarter of next year.", "description": "German wholesaler Metro has agreed to sell a majority stake in its Chinese operations to local retailer Wumart, continuing a drive to simplify its business and focus on its core customers in the hospitality industry.", "authors": ["Julie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439666959&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A12D", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
