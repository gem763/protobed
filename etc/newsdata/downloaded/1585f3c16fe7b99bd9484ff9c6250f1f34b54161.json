USA TODAY\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 The four men often argue, discuss and laugh over any NBA topic. So why would it be any different with how TNT\u2019s \u201cInside the NBA\u201d panel addressed the league\u2019s controversy with China?\n\nIn a press luncheon at Shaquille O'Neal's self-named restaurant in downtown L.A. on Tuesday, Shaq, Charles Barkley, Kenny Smith and Ernie Johnson all spoke candidly about the fallout. They all offered varying opinions on Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeting out support for the Hong Kong protestors, the NBA\u2019s business relationship with China as well as how NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James discussed the issue.\n\nOn one corner of the restaurant, O\u2019Neal reiterated his belief in the First Amendment.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have a problem with what Daryl Morey did,\u201d O\u2019Neal said. \u201cThat\u2019s how he felt. He\u2019s allowed to say it. A lot of people try to mix money and business and all of these things. But am I concerned about the backlash? The answer to your question is no.\u201d\n\nIn another corner of the restaurant, Barkley questioned Morey\u2019s tweet, and how it affected Silver, the Rockets and James before the Lakers and Nets hosted a pair of exhibition games two weeks ago in Shanghai and Shenzhen.\n\n\u201cI thought Daryl Morey has the right of freedom of speech. But he also has to understand he works for the Houston Rockets, which is the No. 1 brand in China for the NBA because of their affiliation for Yao Ming,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cYou can\u2019t insult a foreign country and go make money there. He should\u2019ve looked at the big picture. If he believes that so much, he should not work for the Houston Rockets.\u201d\n\nMorey tweeted \u201cFight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong\u201d on Oct. 4, about a day before the Lakers and Nets flew to Shanghai. Shortly after, Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta publicly stressed Morey\u2019s remarks were inappropriate and did not reflect the organization\u2019s thinking, and Morey then deleted the tweet. In two subsequent tweets, Morey then wrote that he \u201cwas merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event.\u201d Morey added, \u201cI would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention. My tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA.\u201d\n\n2/ I have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention. My tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA. \u2014 Daryl Morey (@dmorey) October 7, 2019\n\nIn the NBA\u2019s initial statement, Silver considered it \u201cregrettable\u201d that Morey\u2019s tweet offended the Chinese government and citizens, while stressing the NBA did not agree with Morey\u2019s stance. In a subsequent statement, Silver declined to apologize to China while defending Morey\u2019s right to free speech. After the Lakers\u2019 week-long trip there, James called Morey \u201cuneducated\u201d and \u201cmisinformed\u201d for not anticipating the ramifications. James also questioned the timing considering this could have affected both players\u2019 safety in China as well as their various business ventures there. James received immediate criticism considering his previous track record for speaking out on social issues and for having business stakes in China through Nike.\n\nOpinion: What LeBron James could have \u2014 and should have \u2014 said about Daryl Morey, China\n\nMore: LeBron James' controversial comments 'furthers his brand power in China'\n\n\u201cI thought it was unfair for everybody to jump on LeBron,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cHe probably shouldn\u2019t have said that about Daryl Morey being misinformed. But you have to understand when you work for the company, you are speaking on behalf of the entire company. I can\u2019t get on TV and say what I want to just because I\u2019m trying to prove a point. We\u2019re not going to change China\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody does business in China. I thought it was really unfair to put the NBA, LeBron and Nike into a fight they had nothing to do with. Every company in the United States does business in China. We got singled out. I thought that was unfair.\u201d\n\nJust like when they debate about basketball, Smith and Barkley then engaged in an honest and direct conversation about the China issue. Hong Kong is a semi-autonomous region in China that has been experiencing protests for months stemming from a proposed extradition bill.\n\n\u201cI believe Daryl has the right to express his opinion politically or socially, regardless,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI do feel he has that right. He also has to take the consequence for it. Obviously there are people in China who feel what he does.\u201d\n\nBarkley interrupted Smith shortly after he made his points.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the issue there. He didn\u2019t get no consequences,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cDaryl Morey has not been seen. That\u2019s another thing that pisses me off the most. Daryl Morey has not been heard from since he put out the tweet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s your opinion,\u201d Smith countered.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a fact,\u201d Barkley responded.\n\n\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d Smith said.\n\n\u201cWhy is that not a fact?\u201d Barkley asked.\n\n\u201cHe did follow up on the tweet,\u201d Smith said.\n\n\u201cHe apologized,\u201d Barkley conceded.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not hiding,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI\u2019m not defending him. I just think he has the right to express his opinion, regardless, especially on social and political issues. But you have to be factual and back it up with facts. As an African American, I can point to social issues we\u2019ve had to speak about that people were making billions of dollars off of, but we had to become factual after the fact. So if you go do that and once you jump in the pool, you have to be in it.\u201d\n\nShaquille O'Neal and Charles Barkley during the 2013 slam dunk contest.

He then tied everything together.\n\n\u201cEverybody has the right to free speech. If you see something wrong, speak out about it,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI also think there is responsibility to know the time and score, to use a basketball analogy. Why are we in China? What is the purpose of our trip? What could this tweet do? Can I wait a little bit? I had no problem with what he tweeted. I just had a problem with the timing.\u201d\n\nJohnson then shared his thought process when he traveled in Cuba in 1991 with ABC for the Pan-Am games. Although dictator Fidel Castro had a poor human rights record under a communist government, Johnson considered it inappropriate \u201cto call out Fidel Castro in a broadcast and say, \u2018This guy has to go.' \" Instead, Johnson considered it more important for the United States to establish inroads with Cuban citizens through baseball.\n\n\u201cWhat you look at what Daryl Morey wanted to tweet and what he did tweet, content is OK,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cTiming needs work.\u201d\n\nVarious NBA promotional events were canceled in Shanghai and Shenzhen. Various Chinese shoe companies, including Peak and Anta, announced they would halt future endorsement deals with NBA players. CCTV, the country\u2019s state-run television, declined to showcase the Lakers-Nets\u2019 preseason games as well as the league\u2019s season opener. The station also has said it will not broadcast any future Rockets games. The NBA players union and the league agreed to halt media appearances to avoid players receiving inquiries about the controversy. Afterwards, James expressed physical safety and financial concerns.\n\nMore: As impasse over pro-Hong Kong tweet simmers, what's at stake for the NBA in China?\n\nMeanwhile, Silver said he declined to listen to China\u2019s demands to fire Morey, something the Chinese government has disputed. Either way, the NBA has no plans to reprimand Morey. So how should the NBA and the Rockets handle Morey moving forward?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a great question,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cListen, he was not wrong. But I thought he put the NBA, the Rockets, LeBron and Nike in a really bad situation on something they had nothing to do with. I don\u2019t know how to answer that question. I don\u2019t want to give you no bogus answer. That was a tough situation to put the NBA in. I hope it goes away. But your guess is as good as mine.\u201d\n\nThe normally outspoken O\u2019Neal sounded just as uncertain.\n\n\u201cThis is why I vowed to stay out of politics. I have no idea,\u201d O\u2019Neal said. \u201cBut Apple has a lot of money in China. Everybody does business in China.\u201d\n\nTherefore, Smith suspected the NBA will continue its business relationship with China. Even if the NBA may experience more financial fallout from canceled telecasts, Smith sounded skeptical China would ever derail any future NBA exhibition games and promotional events over there. Instead, Smith predicted that time will eventual heal these fresh wounds.\n\n\u201cIt can be reconciled. It just has to be explained,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWhen something is different, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right or wrong. It has to be explained. Adam will have to do a good job of explaining to a culture that doesn\u2019t operate that way.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Neal, Barkley, Smith and Johnson did their best to explain their views. O\u2019Neal had already supported Morey leading into the Lakers-Clippers\u2019 season opener on Tuesday. And he sounded apathetic toward any praise or criticism for those remarks.\n\n\u201cIf I wasted my time trying to go answer what every blog said,\u201d O\u2019Neal said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have time to smoke hookah.\u201d\n\nFollow USA Today NBA writer Mark Medina on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.", "description": "The \"Inside the NBA\" crew of Shaquille O'Neal, Charles Barkley, Kenny Smith and Ernie Johnson discussed the NBA-China controversy at a press luncheon.", "authors": ["Mark Medina", "Published P.M.
