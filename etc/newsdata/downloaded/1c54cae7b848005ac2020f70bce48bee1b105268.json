Shapiro says the fossil is about 15 million years old. More\n\n\"I really want to go back and look for it,\" Shapiro said with a laugh.\n\nThus, he said, the fossil could be a sea hippo, a species that also lived in the Pacific when the Simi Valley area was underneath it.\n\n\"We're confident that this rock is of the Miocene age,\" which ranges from 23 million years ago to 5.3 million years ago, he said.\n\n\"We think this particular one is probably about 15 million years old,\" he said.\n\nShapiro said he's excited \"by how much material is in the large block. It's not just a few random bones.\n\n\"But we would be more excited if there was a head,\" he said.\n\nThe fossil \"will definitely add to our knowledge of the area,\" he said. \"And it could be very important for future study.\"\n\nA 600-pound stone block encasing a 15-million-year-old fossil was found on a private road in Simi Valley following July's Ridgrecrest earthquakes. Experts believe the fossil may be a small whale. Shown is Occidental College's Win McLaughlin. More\n\nThe find\n\nThe utility crew spotted the 600-pound block on the private road about two weeks after the earthquakes and contacted SWCA Environmental in Pasadena, a nationwide environmental consulting firm, Shapiro said.\n\n\"Utilities crews, construction crews know that if they uncover artifacts or fossils, they have to alert the authorities,\" he said.\n\nThe crew took photos of the block and sent them to the firm for which Shapiro does some work, he said.\n\nThe firm, in turn, contacted Shapiro and asked him if the block was something that needed protecting, he said.\n\n\"And based on the field photos, we said, 'Yes, this is worth protecting,'\" he said.\n\nThe photos showed a fairly complete torso, he said.\n\n\"But it looked like the head had just snapped off,\" he said.\n\nAbout a month after the fossil was discovered, a team of experts, including Shapiro, went to the site to take possession of the fossil and transport it to CSU Chico, a federally recognized institution for collecting fossils.", "description": "Two powerful earthquakes in Kern County may have dislodged the fossil from the Tapo Canyon area, causing it to roll down into the Simi Valley.", "authors": ["Mike Harris", "Ventura County Star"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7Ui0xD4qkWk88_VLGHoPWg--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/6fa91d616ab6cf2c0834c8a73c90ca73", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
