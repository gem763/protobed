He kidnapped and sexually assaulted a girl, 11, from a park near Newcastle, New South Wales, last June\n\nTo the many women he tried to pick up on Facebook, Brett David Hill seemed like just another desperado looking for love.\n\nHill would call them 'my love' and 'my baby', post suggestive comments and claim he was just 'keen to go out and have fun' with them.\n\nBut the 49-year-old was actually a sick predator who last year abducted and raped an 11-year-old girl in Newcastle, New South Wales.\n\nDaily Mail Australia can reveal how, months before he committed the horrific attack, Hill tried to lure several women into his web with creepy messages.\n\nA chilling cache of social media posts and texts sent to locals and his Malaysian internet girlfriend reveal Hill's desperate attempts to snare a woman.\n\nIn one cringeworthy message, Hill claimed he just couldn't believe a woman on the Newcastle and Hunter Valley Single's page didn't have a boyfriend.\n\n'Lol ur not single?' he asked.\n\n'Why not?' the woman replied.\n\n'Cause ur to pretty (sic),' he said.\n\nAttempts at seduction: A series of posts made by Brett Hill to a local 'singles' Facebook group, about ten weeks before his arrest over his horrendous kidnapping of a schoolgirl\n\nIt all seemed like standard, lovey-dovey fare for someone on the dating scene. But what Hill admitted to doing in the NSW District Court this week is the stuff of nightmares.\n\nOn June 12, 2018, Hill came at a schoolgirl walking through a park with a pair of scissors.\n\nHill demanded the girl accompany him, drove her to bushland and sexually assaulted her for the next five hours.\n\nAbout 2.15pm, Hill released the girl at the Kotara railway station, and she quickly raised the alarm.\n\nWorried police were desperate to get the monster off the streets, lest he attack someone else.\n\nWithin four days, detectives had tracked him down to the red sedan he lived in, arrested and charged him.\n\n'I do love you': How predator ditched online girlfriend -then went crawling back five days before horrific rape\n\nThe Malaysian woman Brett Hill invited to live on a boat with him in Newcastle, New South Wales\n\nAs the publicity faded and Hill waited for his day in court, at least two women were left disturbed by their prior interactions with the rapist.\n\nThe first was a Malaysian woman whom Hill had declared as his girlfriend.\n\nThey had met online and Hill planned for the woman to fly to Australia to visit him.\n\nHe texted her pictures of a yacht he was planning to buy for the two of them onboard.\n\nBut she was confused by his proposal to live on the water.\n\n'You use for what?' the woman asked in a text message.\n\n'Living on,' Hill said.\n\n'You and me??' she asked.\n\nHill then sent her a photo of the boat's interior and said 'I can have it in the middle of my city'.\n\nHe told the woman 'I do love you' and repeatedly called her 'babe'.\n\nBut the couple's online romance flared out after she told him she had got a new job in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nHill, above, sends the woman a photo of the interior of a boat he was thinking of buying - so they could live together in Newcastle Harbour\n\n'I'm not going on with us anymore,' Hill announced, wishing her luck in the future.\n\nBut, just five days before he kidnapped the schoolgirl, Hill came crawling back.\n\n'Where r u my love', he asked, with two crying emojis. 'Do u not want to be with me'.\n\nThe woman could only reply: 'I dont kn0w'.\n\nHill said: 'I take that as a no.No worries take care . Bye'.\n\nThe woman previously said was 'shocked' by the charges, which she only learned about when contacted by one of Hill's friends.\n\nAfter his arrest, she furnished Daily Mail Australia with more than a dozen messages they exchanged over a period of three months.\n\nSome of the final messages Hill exchanged with a woman who claimed to live in Malaysia\n\nThe end: Days before the attack, Hill came crawling back to the Malaysian woman, asking 'where r u my love'\n\nA second woman who interacted with Hill online - a local - said she was driven to deleting him off Facebook because 'he was very strange'.\n\nThe woman, who did not want to be named, was told Hill had an online girlfriend from Malaysia, but that he also claimed to be talking to 'another one too from overseas somewhere'.\n\nHill had been married, and had been in a separate long-term relationship, before the attacks.\n\nBut before his arrest Hill had attempted to sell off an engagement ring on a Buy/Swap/Sell page.\n\nMeanwhile, he lurked on Plenty of Fish and the local dating page, seeking female attention from anyone who deigned to give it to him.\n\n'An absolute hero': How 11-year-old's 'strength, composure and resilience' led to the police arrest - and her father got the final say\n\nA long path to guilty: The vagrant eventually pleaded guilty to 12 charges relating to the abduction and assault\n\nFor police and the family of Hill's victim, the path to justice was a long one. It took sixteen months for the vagrant to plead guilty to 12 charges.\n\nThe charges included kidnapping, seven counts of aggravated sexual assault and four counts relating to possessing child abuse material and 'using' a child to make such material.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to offences in dribs and drabs, in February, May and finally on Wednesday of this week, when he admitted to three final sex assault charges. Prosecutors withdrew four further charges.\n\nEven at the last minute his court proceedings were plagued with drama.\n\nHill's judge-alone trial was meant to start on Monday, but he was taken to hospital for unknown reasons on Sunday and did not return to court until later in the week.\n\nSadly, his admissions did not spare the victim from the ordeal of having to give evidence against him, regional newspaper The Newcastle Herald reported.\n\nThe Herald said the victim's evidence was recorded earlier this year, as is customary for victims of child sexual abuse who testify in court.\n\nThe Newcastle park where Hill kidnapped the girl in June 2018\n\nThe victim was last year praised for her strength and resilience by the principal of her primary school.\n\n'There is much to take heart from the wonderful way our community has come together to support the little girl, her family and each other,' the headmaster.\n\n'(Our school) will not be defined by this event, nor will the little girl who suffered such horrible injustice.\n\n'This little girl is an absolute hero.\n\n'Her strength, composure and resilience has led to the police arrest which has made all Newcastle children safer.\n\n'She is a credit to her family and the teachers who have shaped the development of this amazing person.'\n\nAs for Hill, his sentencing will begin on December 17.\n\nAs was led away to face the prospect of decades behind bars this week, the girl's parents had the final word.\n\nHer father, who watched the proceedings, yelled out: 'Enjoy prison, mate'.", "description": "To the many New South Wales women he tried to pick up on Facebook, Brett David Hill seemed like just another desperado looking for love.", "authors": ["Daniel Piotrowski For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/07/19872290-0-image-a-2_1571379622212.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
