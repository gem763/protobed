The process has since been paused.\n\nMr Kwarteng said: 'I don't think it looks foolish. I think it was a very sincere aim of the British Government to leave on October 31.\n\n'I think it is sad if we don't leave on that date. The reason we are not doing that is because of the Benn Act and the Speaker allowing unprecedented moves.\n\n'They took control of the order paper and passed this act in record time.'\n\nBusiness Minister Kwasi Kwarteng (left in Westminster on Tuesday) blamed Speaker John Bercow (right in Parliament on Monday) for giving 'unprecedented' powers to opposition MPs, allowing them the opportunity to pass the Benn Act, which demanded Brexit be delayed if a deal had not been ratified by October 19\n\nThe Prime Minister last week complied with the stipulations of the law by sending a letter to Brussels requesting an extension. It came following the Benn Act (introduced by Hilary Benn, pictured) which demanded Brexit be delayed if a deal had not been ratified by October 19\n\nDeliberations among EU ambassadors over a Brexit delay have continued into the weekend.\n\nA final decision on whether they will opt for an extension until January or a shorter November delay - thought to be favoured by French president Emmanuel Macron - is not expected until Monday or Tuesday.\n\nThe weekend talks among the EU27's teams are likely to be coloured by a leaked document, seen by the Financial Times, that indicates the Government could look to diverge away from the bloc's rules on workers' rights and environmental protections after Brexit.\n\nThere are fears in some quarters of the EU - and especially in Berlin - that Boris Johnson is preparing to reform Britain into 'Singapore-on-Thames', a low-tax, lightly regulated economy on the edge of Europe, once it has left.\n\nAccording to the FT's report, the leaked Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) document said the way the political declaration - the agreement setting out the aims of the future trade negotiations between the UK and the EU - had drafted the workers' rights and environmental protection commitments left 'room for interpretation'.\n\nMr Johnson this week told MPs the UK was committed to 'the highest possible standards' on both sets of standards - a stance that helped to convince 19 Labour MPs to back his Withdrawal Agreement Bill at second reading on Tuesday.\n\nThe PM laid down the gauntlet by demanding Mr Corbyn approves a poll on December 12, saying it is the only way to resolve the Brexit 'nightmare'\n\nMr Kwarteng called the reports 'way exaggerated' and would be 'completely mad' from the Government's perspective.\n\n'It wouldn't make any sense at all to dilute workers' rights in building that coalition to land the bill,' he told the BBC.\n\nThe document is said to boast that 'UK negotiators successfully resisted the inclusion of all UK-wide level playing-field rules' in the previous deal negotiated by Theresa May's team, allowing Britain to compete against EU members by possibly watering down rights.\n\nLabour shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman said the documents, which reportedly had Downing Street input, 'confirm our worst fears'.\n\nShe said: 'Boris Johnson's Brexit is a blueprint for a deregulated economy, which will see vital rights and protections torn up.'\n\nThe Prime Minister visited a hospital on Friday and used interviews afterwards to call on opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn to 'man up' and agree to a general election.\n\nIt follows the Conservative Party leader announcing on Thursday that he was prepared to give MPs more time to debate his Brexit deal in exchange for their support for a winter election on December 12.\n\nMr Corbyn has so far said Labour is awaiting the EU's decision regarding the length of an Article 50 extension before clarifying whether he would whip MPs to back a fresh poll.\n\nBut senior figures in the party have urged him to deny Mr Johnson and instead continue to push for a second referendum and for a no-deal Brexit to be removed as an option.\n\nThe Prime Minister urged Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn (pictured today) to 'man up' and back his plans for a pre-Christmas general election\n\nBoth Tony Blair, a former prime minister who won three general elections, and London mayor Sadiq Khan called for him to stand firm.\n\nMr Khan, speaking to Italian newspaper La Repubblica, said an election prior to a referendum on a Brexit deal would be 'confusing'.\n\nThe former MP said: 'It's simply not possible to have a general election on one issue.'\n\nThe Liberal Democrats, who have also ruled out agreeing to an election while no-deal is an option, look to have amounted a significant war chest to fund their upcoming campaign.\n\nBusiness Insider reported that the party's fund-raising board confirmed it had surpassed its \u00a38 million target by raising around \u00a311 million for the next general election - a record haul as leader Jo Swinson targets 80 seats in Remain-supporting areas.\n\nBut it's thought remainer politicians are plotting to take control of parliament's timetable again in a similar tactic to that used to force the PM to ask for a Brexit delay with the Benn act.\n\nThe move comes after Johnson urged Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to 'man up' and back his plans for a pre-Christmas general election, as the Brexit process was effectively put on hold while the Labour leader makes up his mind whether to back a snap election.\n\nEx-tory rebel Dominic Grieve (pictured on the Peston show last week) has admitted the plan is an option\n\nRemainer politicians, including Labour's Peter Kyle (pictured in Parliament last week), have discussed plans to bring back the PM's Brexit deal but hold votes to attach a second referendum or a customs union\n\nHowever, if the deadlock remains, Remainer politicians including Labour's Peter Kyle have discussed plans to bring back the PM's Brexit deal but hold votes to attach a second referendum or a customs union.\n\nThe plan would need speaker John Bercow's acquiescence to succeed and ex-tory rebel Dominic Grieve has admitted it's an option.\n\nMP Peter Kyle told The Guardian that they are ready to initiate their plans, which they consider 'one of the options on the shelf', but wanted to see what Mr Corbyn's next moves will be.\n\nHe remains hopeful that MPs may only have to make changes to the existing deal - rather than bring it back completely under the new plans - because he doesn't believe Mr Johnson's threat that MPs would not work on a Brexit deal before Christmas.\n\nHe also said that 'the tide is coming back' in favour of a second referendum.\n\nMr Grieve said: 'Politics is the art of the possible and clearly it's been my argument for a long time that it would be desirable to have a second referendum and put the options available to the public to resolve the problems we have.'\n\nTory minister Nick Boles, on the other hand, said that the plan was doomed to fail.\n\nHe tweeted: 'There is no such plan. And it wouldn't work, as taking a bill of this scale into committee requires a money resolution and Queen's consent, which only the government can provide.'", "description": "Mr Kwarteng blamed the Speaker for allowing MPs the opportunity to pass the Benn Act, which demanded Brexit be delayed if a deal had not been ratified by October 19.", "authors": ["James Wood For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/11/20212730-0-image-a-6_1572084309027.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
