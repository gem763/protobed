The rapprochement comes just over a week before the arrival of the new Apple TV+ subscription streaming video service.\n\nThe Apple TV app is available today if you have a second-generation Fire TV Stick or Fire TV Stick 4K in the U.S., Canada and several other countries, Amazon announced on its Fire TV blog. The app is coming soon to Fire TV Cubes and the third-gen pendant Fire TV devices, Fire TV Edition smart TVs, and Nebula sound bar.\n\nIn addition to being able to subscribe to Apple TV+, when it hits Nov. 1, you can also access your entire iTunes library of movies and TV episodes you have bought or rented.\n\n'Call of Duty: Modern Warfare': New game, out Friday, ramps up realism, so it's not just all fun and video games\n\nTired of too many subscriptions?: Apple TV+, Disney+ streaming launches add to overload\n\nAmazon and Apple have a complicated history in which they often tried to create hurdles for consumers to use the others' services. Just two years ago, Amazon agreed to begin selling Apple TV devices in its online store after halting the sale of them for two years.\n\nThat led to Apple making Amazon's Prime Video app available on Apple TV.\n\nBut it's been tough for consumers to watch content bought from Apple including iTunes movies and music on Amazon devices.\n\nHowever, as Apple looks to increase revenue from its services, the iPhone and iPad maker has moved to make its app more accessible. Earlier this month, the Apple TV app became available on Roku devices.\n\nThe Apple TV app on Roku devices has a bit more functionality, allowing you to rent or buy movies and episodes, whereas the Amazon Fire TV version of the app lets you access previously rented or purchased content.\n\nRoku remains the leader in Net TV devices, with more than 41 million devices in use in the first quarter of 2019, according to research firm Strategy Analytics. But Amazon's Fire TV platform is gaining momentum.\n\nRoku users are able to get the Apple TV app to access iTunes video purchases or rentals and, on Nov. 1, subscribe to Apple TV+.
