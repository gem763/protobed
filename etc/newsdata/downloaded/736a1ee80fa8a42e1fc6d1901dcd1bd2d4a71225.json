(Picture: Paul Davey/SWNS)\n\nA panel at the General Dental Council (GDC) heard Magzine declared she was taking blood-thinning medicine warfarin to treat a clotting condition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter extracting ten teeth in five days, Dr Patel failed to mention increased risk of bleeding and did not stitch up wounds properly or do adequate checks after the procedure.\n\nThe hearing heard how Patel should only have removed a maximum of three teeth during one appointment.\n\nMagzine, who lived her older brother Andrew, sought medical help at King\u2019s College Hospital in London before she collapsed at home on July 19, a day after her second appointment.\n\nAndrew rang an ambulance when he found his sister in a pool of blood but she died later that day.\n\nMagzine\u2019s sister Dawn Boatswain said the family are still struggling to come to terms with what happened and said they think Patel should have been banned for longer.\n\nShe said: \u2018It was extremely hard for us all and yes, we do have anger and pain.\n\n\u2018But the worst thing for us was how at the inquest never once did he (Dr Patel) make eye contact with us or come over to say sorry.\n\nMagzine Gordon\u2019s family paid tribute to her and said Patel should have been banned for longer (Picture: Gordon family / SWNS)\n\n\u2018The challenge for me is that a 12 month suspension is nothing. The sanction is nowhere near strong enough for what has happened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He might be a dentist again next year, whereas we will be without Magzine forever.\u2019\n\nPaying tribute to her beloved sister, Dawn added: \u2018She set up a support group for the LGBT community and was always smiling, was always happy and was a very positive person.\n\n\u2018She loved to help people and we are very proud of her for that.\u2019\n\nPatel, who has 30 years\u2019 experience, admitted the allegations of misconduct that were put to him.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
