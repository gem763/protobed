The stadium has a capacity of about 78,000.\n\nThe tickets for women reportedly sold out within minutes.\n\nPhotos from inside the stadium showed female football fans excitedly waiving Iranian flags and cheering on their team. They were elated to see Iran win the match 14-0.\n\n\"We had fun for three hours. All of us laughed, some of us cried because we were so happy,\" one woman posted on Twitter. \"We had this experience very late in our life but I am so happy for younger girls who came to the stadium today.\"\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWomen were previously allowed into the Azadi Stadium to watch a screening of their team playing Spain in the 2018 World Cup. but Thursday was the first time in decades that they had been allowed to watch a game on Tehran's pitch.\n\nThe issue of gender discrimination in Iranian football came to global prominence last month when Sahar Khodayari, known as \"blue girl\" because of the team she supported, set fire to herself outside court while awaiting trial for trying to attend a match disguised as a man. The 29-year-old died a week later.\n\nFootball's governing body Fifa responded by stepping up pressure on Tehran to meet its commitments to allowing women to attend World Cup qualifiers.\n\nIt said this week that it would \"stand firm\" in ensuring that women had access to all football matches in Iran.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Fifa \"firm\" over women's access to Iran matches after \"blue girl\" tragedy\n\n\"It's not just about one match. We're not going to turn our eyes away from this,\" Fifa's head of education and social responsibility, Joyce Cook, told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We are firm and committed that all fans have an equal right, including women, to attend matches.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia last year allowed women for the first time to attend a football match as part of an easing of strict rules on gender separation by the ultra-conservative Muslim country.", "description": "In a historic moment, female football fans attend a World Cup qualifier against Cambodia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07qq42b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
