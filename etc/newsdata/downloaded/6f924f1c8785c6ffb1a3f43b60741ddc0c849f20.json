Shortcrust I can handle, but puff seems like something you should really only attempt if you're in the Bake Off tent and Paul Hollywood is flashing his blue steels at you. Until then, a sheet of pre-rolled all butter puff pastry is a seriously handy thing to have in your fridge. Some slow cooked onions, anchovies and a few olives and you have a proper pissaladi\u00e8re in minutes. Spread tomato puree over the pastry, sprinkle over grated parmesan, and chilli flakes, roll up, slice and bake for an easy nibble.\n\nThis recipe is a great way to serve an impressive looking dinner with minimal effort. Serve with a simple green salad.\n\n...", "description": "One day, I'll be the sort of person who makes their own puff pastry.", "authors": ["Eleanor"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/food-and-drink/2019/03/06/tartpot-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq01hEHXp48ZjlCwDoPtrE-AmG0oGsSkGKgMcOGiHqha8.JPG?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-03-06"}
