Why Not (Warner)\n\nRating:\n\nVerdict: He\u2019s (almost) mellowed\n\nThe band were never as wholesome as their image suggested \u2014 Chaplin (above) has twice been treated for cocaine addiction \u2014 and rock\u2019s unlikely wild men address their demons on Strange Room. If all this male introspection sounds like heavy going, it isn\u2019t\n\nBand reunions are usually nostalgic affairs that allow musicians to boost their bank balances while revisiting former glories.\n\nNot so with Keane, whose first album in seven years is a rewarding addition to a catalogue that has already yielded five chart-topping LPs.\n\nIt would have been easy for the East Sussex group to update the pop anthems of 2004\u2019s Hopes And Fears or the Euro rhythms of 2008\u2019s Perfect Symmetry.\n\nInstead, they\u2019ve done something fresh without abandoning their fondness for a good tune.\n\nCause And Effect is a break-up album inspired by the end of keyboardist Tim Rice-Oxley\u2019s marriage.\n\nIt examines the roots of his romantic discord \u2014 ego problems; \u2018the little lies and alibis\u2019 \u2014 and the distressing consequences.\n\nAs Keane\u2019s main songwriter, he addresses his problems with bluntness, bleak humour and a lack of self-pity.\n\nHis words, true to form, are given an extra edge by Tom Chaplin\u2019s soaring, choirboy vocals, and this return takes its power from a renewal of the duo\u2019s enigmatic partnership.\n\nOne of the reasons Keane took an open-ended break in 2013 was because Rice-Oxley and Chaplin found it hard to communicate, but they bonded over a set of new songs that left them desperate to work together again.\n\nThose songs are more grown-up than before, rather like the disparity between the teenage heartbreak of George Michael\u2019s Careless Whisper and the genuine sadness of the later Jesus To A Child.\n\nLiam Gallagher topped the charts with As You Were and wisely keeps the same backroom team for this sophomore effort. Producers Andrew Wyatt and Greg Kurstin again co-write with the charismatic Gallagher and the upshot is a sharper, stronger set of songs with a contemporary sheen\n\n\u2018Hopes And Fears was a break-up album, but it was written when I was 19,\u2019 says Tim.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s different when you\u2019re older and have kids.\u2019 They soon cut to the chase.\n\nYou\u2019re Not Home lays bare a sense of guilt, pain and quiet desperation. Love Too Much mixes melancholy lyrics with a memorable hook, a classic Keane one-two.\n\nThe band were never as wholesome as their image suggested \u2014 Chaplin has twice been treated for cocaine addiction \u2014 and rock\u2019s unlikely wild men address their demons on Strange Room.\n\nIf all this male introspection sounds like heavy going, it isn\u2019t. Keane\u2019s appreciation of a pop hook has seen Rice-Oxley sought out by Kylie, and his melodic skill lights up The Way I Feel.\n\nThere are faint echoes of the band\u2019s darker second album Under The Iron Sea. Put The Radio On is a ballad of romantic deception. I\u2019m Not Leaving is a reminder that Keane, in their early days, were often likened to Radiohead.\n\nWith its dense instrumentation, David Kosten\u2019s production is rich. But Keane have a singer \u2014 and the songs \u2014 to hold their own on a return that is more than a victory lap.\n\nLiam Gallagher topped the charts with As You Were and wisely keeps the same backroom team for this sophomore effort.\n\nProducers Andrew Wyatt and Greg Kurstin again co-write with the charismatic Gallagher and the upshot is a sharper, stronger set of songs with a contemporary sheen.\n\nLyrics are again a weakness, but the former Oasis frontman sings with tuneful conviction.\n\nShockwave is a vitriolic glam-rock stomp. One Of Us, all strummed guitars and strings, could be about his brother Noel. Halo, sung with a rasping sneer, is a Stones-meets-Bowie rocker.\n\nWhy Me? Why Not isn\u2019t just about settling scores. Liam also shows his sensitive side, looking back at lost youth on Once and celebrating domestic harmony on Now That I\u2019ve Found You.\n\n\u2018I know my strengths,\u2019 he says. \u2018I\u2019m an OK songwriter, but a great singer.\u2019 One with a burgeoning solo career.\n\nKeane play Bexhill\u2019s De La Warr Pavilion tonight (keanemusic.com). Liam Gallagher starts a tour on November 11 at the Motorpoint Arena, Cardiff (livenation.co.uk).\n\nAlbum of the week\n\nBrittany Howard: Jaime (Columbia)\n\nRating:\n\nVerdict: Genre-busting debut\n\nAs singer and guitarist with the Alabama Shakes, Brittany Howard was a blues belter whose fiery voice prompted comparisons with Aretha Franklin.\n\nHer band topped the American charts and she once sang Get Back with Paul McCartney at the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago.\n\nThe Alabama Shakes remain, but Howard is using her first solo album to expand her horizons.\n\nBrittany credits her sibling with teaching her how to play the piano and write lyrics, but stresses that these songs are about her own life. There are dramatic moments\n\nIt veers haphazardly between rock, soul and folk, and sounds gritty as instruments blur into one another - but it reiterates her stature as an artist who cannot be pinned down.\n\nThe album is named after her sister, who died from a rare form of cancer when the singer was nine.\n\nBrittany credits her sibling with teaching her how to play the piano and write lyrics, but stresses that these songs are about her own life.\n\nThere are dramatic moments. He Loves Me examines her relationship with God, its psychedelic guitar building on the rockier elements of Sound & Color, the second Alabama Shakes album.\n\nThe harrowing Goat Head is informed by her experiences as a mixed-race child in the Deep South.\n\nAmong the guests are Robert Glasper, a jazz keyboardist whose progressive playing adds an intriguing veneer to a debut that is a world away from the lean, clean sound of most modern pop.\n\nNew releases- Rock & pop\n\nThe Lumineers: III (Decca)\n\nAmerica\u2019s answer to Mumford & Sons return with a concept album about three generations of the fictional Sparks family\n\nMaxi Priest is one of only two UK reggae acts to top the American charts\n\nAmerica\u2019s answer to Mumford & Sons return with a concept album about three generations of the fictional Sparks family.\n\nIts tales of addiction and blue-collar romance move the New Jersey outfit away from the arena-pleasing pop of 2012\u2019s Ho Hey, but their vividly-observed character studies have a beguiling depth.\n\nLife In The City and My Cell are detailed piano pieces and the band\u2019s original street-busker spirit returns on Gloria.\n\nRating:\n\nMaxi Priest: It All Comes Back To Love (S-Curve)\n\nMaxi Priest is one of only two UK reggae acts to top the American charts \u2014 the other is UB40 \u2014 and his international outlook is strong on an album fusing pop, reggae and soul with silky assurance.\n\nNew York dancehall star Shaggy produces and supplies gruff backing on the slinky Cool Nuh. Estelle and R&B star Anthony Hamilton guest on Anything You Want. The brass-heavy title track\u2019s romantic glow finds Priest in his element.\n\nRating:", "description": "ADRIAN THRILLS: With its dense instrumentation, David Kosten's production is rich.
