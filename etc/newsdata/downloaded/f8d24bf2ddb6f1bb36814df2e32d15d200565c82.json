One of the women, a British-Australian academic, was arrested several months ago, sources confirmed to the Guardian. The Times reported she had been sentenced to 10 years in prison and put in solitary confinement. The other woman, a blogger, was reportedly told by Iranian authorities she was being held to facilitate a prisoner swap with Australia, whose consular officials are leading negotiations with Tehran over the detentions. She and her male Australian partner were said to have been detained after camping in a military area in Tehran province.\n\nThe arrests come amid tensions between Australia, Britain, the United States and Iran. The Australian government has committed to joining a US-led mission in the Strait of Hormuz. The two women have reportedly been detained in Tehran\u2019s Evin jail, where 41-year-old British-Iranian national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been locked up on spying charges since 2016. The whereabouts of the man are not known. Typically, foreign nationals are brought before secretive trials in Iran and sentenced to long prison terms based on vague \u201cnational security\u201d or \u201cespionage\u201d charges, according to human rights defenders.\n\nMidweek catch-up\n\n> International students are to be offered a two-year work visa after graduating from a British university, overturning a key plank of Theresa May\u2019s immigration policies.\n\n> With the party conferences approaching, Labour is set to debate radical manifesto proposals including a four-day week, abolishing private schools and a zero-carbon target by 2030.\n\n> The Israeli election campaign rumbles on with Benjamin Netanyahu declaring he would annex large swathes of the occupied Palestinian territories if re-elected \u2013 a decision that would smash the idea of Palestinian statehood.\n\n> A fresh crisis looms for the Kevin McCloud, the Grand Designs presenter, after a failed attempt to restructure property bond investments in his troubled housing empire. An investor who put in several thousand pounds said: \u201cThe whole thing is a shambles.\u201d\n\n> The UK has accused Iran of selling oil to Syria from the tanker that was seized off Gibraltar by British marines. It was released on condition the sale not go ahead but proceeded to Syria where British officials say the oil was offloaded to smaller boats.\n\n> Russia thought a Kremlin insider had been murdered when he had actually fled Moscow with his family because he was a CIA spy. It has been reported that Oleg Smolenkov was pulled out because the CIA feared Donald Trump was putting him in danger.\n\nWar hawk down \u2013 Donald Trump has fired his national security adviser, John Bolton, in a surprise development that sparked a degree of barely concealed glee elsewhere in the administration. He is third national security adviser fired by the president in as many years. Trump wrote of Bolton: \u201cI disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the administration, and therefore I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning.\u201d Bolton claimed he offered to resign first. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, said: \u201cThere were definitely places that Ambassador Bolton and I had different views about how we should proceed.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 1:29 'I'm never surprised': Mike Pompeo reacts to John Bolton's firing \u2013 video\n\nAsked if he had been taken unawares by the development, Pompeo said: \u201cI\u2019m never surprised.\u201d The departure of the hawkish Bolton raises the possibility that Trump might soften his foreign policy in the run-up to next year\u2019s elections, in particular with respect to Iran. Julian Borger writes: \u201cFor the president, that involves shaking hands with adversaries and announcing diplomatic breakthroughs with the likes of Tehran and the Taliban. Almost no one expected him to be able to make that hairpin pivot with someone as bellicose and determined as Bolton at his side.\u201d\n\nWatson: be the party of remain \u2013 The Labour deputy leader, Tom Watson, is to call today for his party to \u201cunambiguously and unequivocally back remain\u201d and push for a referendum before a general election. An election alone \u201cmight well fail to solve this Brexit chaos\u201d, Watson is due to say. MPs looking to stop no deal are exploring ways to bring back a version of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal plus a vote on a second referendum in the last two weeks of October after parliament returns. Ken Clarke, one of those fired from the Tories by Boris Johnson last week, has said he would be willing to be an \u201chonorific figurehead\u201d for an alternative government seeking such a compromise. The EU has said a Northern Ireland-only backstop \u2013 previously rejected by Theresa May as a threat to the UK\u2019s integrity \u2013 might be back on the table to salvage a deal. Downing Street has denied considering it, after the suggestion rattled the Democratic Unionists.\n\nSuperbugs on the march \u2013 Bacteria are increasingly developing ways of resisting antibiotics, threatening a future in which patients could become untreatable, doctors have warned. Over the past five years Public Health England has identified 32 \u201cpan-drug resistant bacteria\u201d that could not be killed by any antibiotic; while in the last decade UK scientists have identified 19 new ways that bacteria resist the drugs. On Wednesday they announced a new strain of group A streptococcus suspected of causing a big rise in children getting scarlet fever and throat infections. It can also cause sepsis or toxic shock. NHS England says it is reducing use of antibiotics to keep them as effective as possible, with patients offered other treatments. The annual death toll resulting from antibiotic resistance stands at 2,200.\n\nSet to stun \u2013 DNA research has revealed two entirely new species of electric eel in the Amazon basin, including one capable of delivering a record-breaking jolt of 860 volts, much more than existing record of 650 volts. The new kind is called Electrophorus voltai and scientists say it is \u201cthe strongest bioelectricity generator known\u201d. Electric eels \u2013 actually fish \u2013 generate electricity from three specialised electric organs that can emit charges of varying strengths.\n\nToday in Focus podcast: Could Johnson\u2019s election strategy work?\n\nAnushka Asthana hears from the Guardian\u2019s John Harris on how the chaos in Westminster looks to people in towns around the UK.

The waiter went off and checked with the kitchen. \u201cHe spoke with the chef and came back and said it was OK.\u201d Feltwell bit into the pastry \u2013 and immediately had an allergic reaction. The chef insisted: \u201cWell, we make the pastry with egg, but then we fry it and bake it, so there\u2019s no egg left!\u201d Feltwell spent the next four hours vomiting in his hotel room.\n\nIt\u2019s not just chefs Feltwell needs to watch out for. Once, on a camping holiday, a companion slipped an egg into his curry. \u201cHe was trying to make the point that my egg allergy wasn\u2019t real \u2026 It ruined the holiday.\u201d Others have similar tales: mushroom powder hidden in mashed potatoes, beef unthinkingly cooked in beer and served to a gluten-intolerant person. As Sirin Kale writes, well-publicised fatalities like that of 15-year-old Natasha Ednan-Laperouse \u2013 who died from eating a baguette not labelled as containing sesame \u2013 seem not to have deterred chefs, friends and even relations from trying to mislead or trick food allergy sufferers into eating dangerously.\n\nSport\n\nJadon Sancho scored his first two goals for England in a wild 5-3 win over Kosovo on a night when they were 1-0 down in the first minute and Harry Kane missed a penalty. Joe Root is under \u201cno pressure\u201d as England cricket captain, according to outgoing coach Trevor Bayliss. Jimmy Anderson believes he can become the world\u2019s No 1 Test bowler once more and, to make this goal a reality, now plans to study how other elite athletes prolong their careers.\n\nAlun Wyn Jones leads Wales on to the plane bound for Tokyo on Wednesday for his fourth Rugby World Cup, hoping the tournament will not be scarred by a flurry of red cards for dangerous tackles. And anti-discrimination groups have urged the French Football Federation president, No\u00ebl Le Gra\u00ebt, to resign after he said matches should no longer be stopped when there is homophobic chanting.\n\nBusiness\n\nThe government must take urgent action to protect Britain\u2019s high streets, retailers and unions say, as a new study reveals that shop closures are occurring at their fastest rate for a decade. The analysis says an average of 16 shops, pubs and restaurants are shutting every day and only nine are taking their place. Asian investors have maintained the optimistic mood in financial markets as hopes of a US-China trade agreement rise. The FTSE100 is set to pick up the vibe with a rise of 0.4% at the opening. The pound is up to $1.236 and \u20ac1.118.\n\nThe papers\n\nThe Guardian reports this morning: \u201cRetailers urge ministers to step in as high street store closures soar\u201d and the Express has: \u201cScandal of care homes evicting elderly\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Guardian front page, Wednesday 11 September 2019.
