Nita Lowey has kicked off a scramble among Democratic politicians for her New York seat, which will be open for the first time in more than three decades.\n\nHours after the 82-year-old Lowey announced that she would not seek reelection next year, observers were already floating the names of several local politicians as possible successors \u2014 including Assemblymembers David Buchwald (D-White Plains), Amy Paulin (D-Westchester) and Tom Abinanti (D-Greenburgh), and state Sen. David Carlucci (D-Clarkstown).\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe biggest name among potential contenders is Chelsea Clinton \u2014 long rumored as a possible candidate for the seat if it became vacant, though she\u2019s given no public hint of plans to jump in.\n\nBefore announcing her retirement, Lowey, the powerful chair of the House Appropriations Committee and a steadfast ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was already facing a challenge from the left by former Obama administration staffer Mondaire Jones.\n\nThe 32-year-old Jones, who is aiming to become the first openly gay black member of Congress, brought in more than $218,000 for the race over the last three months, his campaign said Thursday.\n\n\"There\u2019s never been an openly gay, black member of Congress \u2014 because people like me don\u2019t usually get anywhere close,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cBut we\u2019re about to make history.\u201d\n\nWhile the progressive challenger had been going after Lowey for failing to fight for the district, he praised her Thursday for her \u201cyears of inspiring service to the district\u201d and called her \u201ca trailblazer for women and minorities such as myself.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have the advantage in the district, with about 220,000 registered Democrats and 108,000 Republicans.\n\n\u201cI think it probably will generate a great deal of interest because we have not seen an open congressional seat in Westchester in decades,\u201d said former Republican state Sen. Nick Spano, whose family has long had an outsize influence in the county. \u201cSo this will be a generational change, and it\u2019s going to reflect the demographic changes in the Hudson Valley.\u201d\n\nEvan Stavisky, a campaign consultant who has worked for Lowey in the past, said the race could be competitive for Republicans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good Democratic district, but this is not a slam dunk Democratic district,\u201d he said. \u201cA Democrat should be expected to win, but if they can\u2019t appeal to moderate suburbanites, there could be a challenge.\u201d\n\nOn the Republican side, Rockland County GOP Chairman Lawrence Garvey said that he\u2019s \u201calready heard from some very interesting people that are at least going to take a look at it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s exciting; a little bit unexpected,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it certainly opens up an opportunity for Republicans to win.\u201d\n\nOne prominent Republican who has won races in the district in the past is former Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino, Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s 2014 opponent and a current political commentator on CNN.\n\n\u201cPeople are talking to Astorino and his team is looking at it,\u201d said Bill O'Reilly, a former spokesperson for Astorino. \u201cHe\u2019s happy with his current life situation, but it\u2019s worth taking a look at, certainly.\u201d\n\nA crowded field could shrink should Clinton \u2014 whose family lives in Westchester, though she currently lives in Manhattan \u2014 choose to jump in, Spano said. \u201cI would think that there are certain candidates that could clear the decks and that Chelsea Clinton is one of them.\u201d\n\nClinton's office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSome local Democrats acknowledged a potential interest Thursday in jumping into the race.\n\n\u201cI really want to think this through before I jump into it. But in full transparency, it\u2019s something that I\u2019ve thought about for a long time,\u201d said Carlucci, who like the other state legislators, would need to give up his seat to mount a congressional bid. \u201cI\u2019m going to talk to my family and friends and residents and really assess where I can be most effective.\u201d\n\nBuchwald \u2014 who authored the legislation that theoretically gives Congress the power to obtain President Donald Trump\u2019s New York state tax returns \u2014 was mentioned by several observers as a likely entrant.\n\nThe Assemblyman, who interned in Lowey\u2019s Washington office in 1997, did not deny having an eye on the seat, but said, \u201cToday is a day to recognize the accomplishments of Congresswoman Lowey.\u201d\n\nAbinanti said he\u2019d \u201ccertainly consider\u201d a run, but expects plenty of others to take the plunge as well.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m expecting that every elected official who lives in Nita\u2019s district will look at the opportunity and weigh it to see if its worth jumping into the primary,\u201d Abinanti said. \u201cThe leading contenders are people who would have to give up important positions in order to enter a contested primary, but this is a real opportunity to move to the center of chaos and hopefully be part of the solution.\u201d\n\nOthers in the party reached by POLITICO Thursday said they\u2019re still looking to find their footing in the aftermath of the announcement.\n\nAssemblywoman Amy Paulin (D-Westchester) said she was just as surprised as anyone else on Thursday, but that calls to her office were already piling up. She did not confirm or shoot down an inquiry into her interest.\n\n\u201cI honestly just heard 30 seconds ago, maybe even 15,\u201d Paulin said. \u201cI have no thoughts now, but will be doing a little investigating. I assure you I will let everybody know when I have a sense of what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nThe counties in the district have repeatedly backed establishment Democrats rather than members of the new crop of progressive challengers. Former Mount Kisco resident Cuomo received 72 percent of the vote in Westchester when he was challenged in the race for governor by actress and activist Cynthia Nixon last year; he received 67 percent in Rockland.\n\nThere\u2019s optimism among progressives, however, that the district might welcome somebody from the left.\n\n\u201cNita\u2019s a perfect example of somebody who on paper isn\u2019t supposed to win in a place like Westchester,\u201d said Shannon Powell, co-founder of Indivisible Westchester, which does not endorse in primaries. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in my mind that says somebody else like a modern-day Nita couldn\u2019t do the same thing right now.\u201d\n\nOne top Democrat who\u2019s very familiar with the district will not be seeking the seat \u2014 Cuomo, who until recently lived in Westchester with his now-ex girlfriend Sandra Lee.\n\n\u201cThe Governor made very clear during last year\u2019s election that he\u2019s going to serve out his entire term,\u201d spokesperson Rich Azzopardi said Thursday.", "description": "The biggest name among potential contenders is Chelsea Clinton \u2014 though she\u2019s given no public hint of plans to jump in.", "authors": ["Anna Gronewold", "Bill Mahoney", "Erin Durkin"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/75/6f/1311d53a46fabbeae1cb05b5a5e3/gettyimages-580949274.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
