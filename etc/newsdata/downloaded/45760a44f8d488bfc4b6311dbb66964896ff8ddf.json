Not Davey Johnson the genius, not Matt Williams the general, not Dusty Baker the cool one.\n\nDave Martinez\n\nHe had the camels \u2014 symbols of the postseason hump the Nationals could not get over \u2014 brought to spring training in 2018, his first year with the Nationals, as a lighthearted way of letting the team know he understood the pressure they were under.\n\nTurns out it took a 19-31 start to really get these Washington Nationals relaxed.\n\nThis team had a historic finish, a 93-69 final record to reach the wild card \u2014 only the ninth team in the history of the game to start out 12 games under .500 and reach the playoffs.\n\nThe rebound continued with a a dramatic eighth-inning comeback in the wild card game against the Milwaukee Brewers, thanks to a bases-clearing double by Juan Soto for the 4-3 win.\n\nAnd in Game 5 Wednesday night, after Stephen Strasburg was blasted early with two home runs, giving Los Angeles a 3-0 lead after just two innings, the Nationals came back again \u2014 an RBI single by Soto in the sixth inning, followed by back-to-back home runs by Anthony Rendon and Soto in the eighth inning off Clayton Kershaw in relief to tie the game at 3-3.\n\nWashington now heads for St. Louis for Game 1 Friday night to face the Cardinals, who knocked the Atlanta Braves out in their Game 5 contest Wednesday by the score of 13-1.\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 postseason woes began against the Cardinals in the 2012 division series.\n\nThis time, though, it is the League Championship Series \u2014 the first for the Nationals.\n\nThe postseason pain of the Nationals had become the stuff of legends \u2014 the six-run blown lead in Game 5 in 2012, when the Nationals playoff history was just beginning; the three-run lead given up to the Dodgers in Game 5 of the 2016 division series.\n\nThen there was the madness of 2017, when the best pitcher on the planet, Max Scherzer fell victim to three straight two-out hits, a disputed passed ball, catcher\u2019s interference and a hit batter in the Game 5 division series loss to the Chicago Cubs.\n\nAll failures seemed possible after that.\n\nBut this 2019 team has a personality the others did not \u2014 one built for adversity. Those previous four Nationals postseason teams coasted to division titles. This team, as Martinez has said so often, has essentially played a wild card game every day since that 19-31 start.\n\n\u201cWe have been through this since May 24th,\u201d he told reporters before the game.\n\n\u201cWe have been playing playoff games since May 24th. I mean, that\u2019s the way we look at it. So I did tell them, I said, \u2018Look, I packed a lot of clothes in my suitcase, so I don\u2019t want to pack for nothing, so let\u2019s keep it going.\u2019\u201d\n\nWednesday night they showed that this team is not defined by painful past failures.\n\nBut nobody should forget them. It makes victory that much sweeter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to remember how it feels,\u201d general manager Mike Rizzo said after the Game 5 collapse of 2012. \u201cWe have to have a burning desire never for it to happen again.\u201d\n\nIt took a long time \u2014 but it finally didn\u2019t happen again. The camels can rest easy.\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
