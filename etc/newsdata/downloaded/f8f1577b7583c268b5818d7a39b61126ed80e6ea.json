This is for a 26-28 per cent reduction in emissions on 2005 levels \u2013 a target the government has repeatedly insisted \u201cwill be met in a canter\u201d and years ahead of the deadline.\n\nThis is meant to counter persistent criticism, including from much of the energy industry, that Canberra lacks a coherent energy and emissions reduction strategy.\n\nThe Emissions Reduction Fund has so far paid for 190 million tonnes of carbon abatement at a cost of $15 a tonne or less but now has less than $250 million left of the original $2.55 billion allocated.\n\nKing, a former chief executive of Origin Energy as well as the retiring president of the Business Council, says the successful bids have largely come from the agricultural and land use sectors rather than industry, energy or transport.\n\n\u201cWe want to broaden the engagement and accelerate the rate at which reduction occurs,\u201d he tells The Australian Financial Review. \u201cWe have received around 40 submissions so far.\u201d\n\nInvesting in reliability\n\nThe panel is one of several measures taken by the Morrison government as part of what it is calling \u201cA Fair Deal on Energy\u201d. Beyond the Utopia-style title, this is meant to counter persistent criticism, including from much of the energy industry, that Canberra lacks a coherent energy and emissions reduction strategy.\n\nThe government also announced on Wednesday an additional $1 billion for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to back projects to help stabilise and support the power grid. This is part of its plan to back investment in \u201cfirming\u201d power permanently available to ensure the energy system remains stable as well as reliable when the generation of wind and solar power is low or non-existent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is no secret that the National Electricity Market is under pressure,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cThis fund is designed to tackle that and is part of a suite of initiatives that the government is delivering to ensure when people flick the switch, the lights come on and stay on.\u201d\n\nThe new CEFC-administered \u201cgrid reliability fund\u201d will centralise the government\u2019s financial support for new generation and storage from sources such as batteries, pumped hydro and gas, as well as some of the investment needed to upgrade transmission networks.\n\nBut the money is primarily designed to provide a form of a banking facility or guarantee designed to unlock additional private sector investment, mainly by underwriting new dispatchable generation projects.\n\nThis includes underwriting most of the 12 projects the government has already shortlisted for federal backing, although it is still negotiating the details of this with the individual companies selected. All involve pumped hydro or gas projects in Victoria, NSW, South Australia, Tasmania and Queensland with the one exception of the upgrade of a coal-fired power station in NSW.\n\nTurnbull: 'a one out of two'\n\nThis upgrade will now be supported via a different mechanism given the mandate \u2013 not to mention the name \u2013 of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. But the original vision for the CEFC has been largely rendered redundant by the extraordinary growth in wind and solar power since its establishment by the Labor government. That was to bolster innovation and investment in renewable energy given what was then a fledgling commercial industry.\n\nThe corporation had not received any new capital since 2012.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull quickly rejected the failed attempt by Tony Abbott to abolish the CEFC. Turnbull was even quicker to respond to the Morrison government\u2019s latest contribution, praising it on Twitter as a \u201cgood move\u201d while saying it was \u201cworth recalling\u201d his predecessor\u2019s view.\n\nNot that Turnbull is reconciled to his successor\u2019s approach to emissions reduction either, grading the government's effort as a one out of two.\n\nA key factor to ensure the fund\u2019s success, he says, will be \u201czero emissions electricity, deliverable by renewables plus storage including pumped hydro\u201d and \u201celectrification of the economy esp[sic] transport, heating, cooling\u201d and with \"more transmission vital\".\n\nTurnbull was the prime minister who came up with the massive and massively expensive pumped hydro project of Snowy 2.0, of course. And despite welcoming recent announcements, Turnbull maintains \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 that much more is still needed.\n\nThe Morrison government is certainly aware of the need to demonstrate it is meeting that need. Its website proudly details the three pillars of its \u201cenergy policy blueprint\u201d \u2013 reliable, secure and affordable supply; putting consumers first and meeting our international commitments.\n\nIt is confident disruptive climate change protests like those against a Melbourne mining conference this week will only consolidate broader community support for its more moderate approach to climate change targets relative to Labor. But that still requires demonstrating the government can deliver both lower prices and lower emissions. September quarter inflation figures showing a 0.7 per cent reduction in electricity prices won\u2019t be nearly enough.", "description": "The Morrison government is determined to counter the persistent criticism that it lacks a coherent energy and emissions reduction strategy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.4572%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/73c648059393c14e2487b6778db7986c3747bad5", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
