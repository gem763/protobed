Amy Klobuchar speaks during the Democratic presidential candidates debate in Westerville, Ohio, October 15, 2019. (Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) and South Bend, Ind. mayor Pete Buttigieg criticized Senator Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) during Tuesday evening\u2019s debate over her refusal to admit that her Medicare for All plan would require an increase in middle class taxes.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down,\u201d Warren said when asked if her proposal would require an increase in middle class taxes. \u201cI will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.\u201d\n\nWarren has repeatedly dodged questioning over whether a Medicare for All plan would raise taxes for the middle class, instead arguing that \u201ccosts will down.\u201d\n\nThe response drew a challenge from Pete Buttigieg, who released an ad Monday touting the advantages of his public option plan, which, unlike Sanders\u2019 and Warrens\u2019 Medicare for All proposal, preserves the private insurance market.\n\n\u201cA yes or no question that didn\u2019t get a yes or no answer,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cLook, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general, and Capitol Hill. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion-dollar hole in this Medicare for All plan that senator Warren is putting forward.\u201d\n\nAfter Warren responded by stating Medicare for All is the \u201cway we get health care coverage for every single American,\u201d Bernie Sanders added, \u201cas someone who wrote the damn bill\u201d that \u201cit is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar then weighed in and took aim at Warren, casting her Medicare for All plan as a fanciful and politically unrealistic commitment.\n\n\u201cAt least Bernie\u2019s being honest here and saying how he\u2019s gonna pay for this and that taxes are going to go up,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Elizabeth, but you\u2019ve not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we\u2019re gonna send the invoice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI appreciate Elizabeth\u2019s work. The difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done,\u201d she added.\n\nLater in the debate, former Vice President Joe Biden gave his thoughts, claiming that \u201cI\u2019m the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done. Both [Biden and Warren] are being vague on the issue of the Medicare for all.\u201d", "description": "Senator Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) and Southbend, Ind. mayor Pete Buttigieg criticized Senator Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) during Tuesday evening\u2019s debate over her refusal to admit that her Medicare for All plan would require an increase in middle class taxes.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
