But the terms of its departure \u2014 or indeed, when or even if it departs \u2014 remain in a deep fog following Johnson\u2019s humiliating defeat in the House of Commons over the weekend.\n\nOn Saturday, Parliament voted to withhold support for Johnson\u2019s deal, triggering a law that required Johnson to send a letter to the E.U. asking for a Brexit delay until Jan. 31.\n\nIf a so-called \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d happens on Monday \u2014 Meaningful Monday? \u2014 then the government says it\u2019s confident it has the numbers to pass. Number crunchers said that it would be tight, but that they could see a route by which Johnson gets the support he needs.\n\nAD\n\nAll eyes were on House of Commons Speaker John Bercow, who, in one of his final pivotal acts, will decide on Monday afternoon if Parliament proceeds with an up-down vote on Johnson\u2019s Brexit. Bercow has announced that he is stepping down from his role at the end of the month.\n\nAD\n\nIt is possible that Bercow could argue against the government, saying that in effect such a vote already happened on Saturday and that going forward would be debating the same issue twice.\n\nIn that case, attention would shift to the so-called withdrawal agreement bill, the legislation to be published on Monday that\u2019s needed to implement the Brexit deal into domestic law.\n\nJohnson\u2019s government hopes that Britain can still leave the E.U. at the end of the month if it passes the legislation through both the Houses of Commons and Lords within the next 10 days. Government ministers said they would be willing to sit through the night and work on weekends to make it happen.\n\nAD\n\nBut on Monday, opposition lawmakers were plotting amendments to the legislation, which could delay its passage or perhaps even make it unacceptable to the Conservative Party or to the E.U. Johnson and his allies view such moves as plots designed to thwart Brexit. The pro-Brexit tabloid newspapers have called such opposition efforts acts of \u201csabotage.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe amendments could include proposals to keep Britain in the E.U. customs union or require a confirmatory referendum on the deal \u2014 essentially a second Brexit referendum.\n\nJustine Greening, a former Conservative minister, said she\u2019d back an amendment for a second referendum because things have changed since the 2016 vote when Britons opted by 52-48 percent to leave the E.U.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re three and a half years on from Brexit and I think whatever happens, it feels like we are a very long way away from the lofty ideals of that campaign,\u201d she said.\n\nMeanwhile on Monday, a Scottish court was considering whether Johnson complied with the law to seek a Brexit extension with his multiple letter writing and unsigned document.\n\nJohnson, who had said he\u2019d rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d than ask for an extension, sent three letters to the E.U. on Saturday night. He sent one, unsigned, asking for an extension, and a second letter and a cover letter making it clear he was against it.\n\nAD\n\nE.U. diplomats in Brussels told The Washington Post they will watch developments unfold in Britain before deciding on the delay request.\n\nAD", "description": "The prime minister insists Britain will still leave the E.U. in 10 days.", "authors": ["Karla Adam", "London Correspondent Covering The United Kingdom", "William Booth", "London Bureau Chief"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/cwDD0ucAw-r_uY-Zt62-SOKPIHY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/65XTQVXT7AI6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
