Not one bit.\n\nBradshaw, the longtime Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback and current NFL analyst on Fox, slammed Brown on Friday after his tumultuous summer \u2014 one that resulted in the wide receiver landing a one-year deal with the New England Patriots.\n\n\u201cI had no idea [the Steelers] catered to Brown as much as they supposedly did,\u201d Bradshaw said, via the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. \u201cI can\u2019t stand players like Antonio Brown.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n[Watch NFL games on your phone for FREE with the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nBradshaw took it a step further. If Brown were on his team, Bradshaw would never get him the ball.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t throw to him,\u201d Bradshaw said, via the Tribune-Review.\n\nBrown showed out on the field for the Steelers, recording six consecutive seasons with more than 1,200 receiving yards at the end of his time in Pittsburgh. Yet how the 31-year-old has acted in recent months since his departure from the Steelers has completely distracted from anything he\u2019s ever done on the field.\n\nIn just his short time with the Oakland Raiders, Brown suffered a weird frozen feet injury, went on an extremely long battle against the NFL about his old, unsafe helmet, threatened his general manager, apologized to the team after they threatened to suspend him and then requested his release \u2014 which the team later granted him. While he signed with the Patriots just hours after that release, multiple sexual assault allegations against him surfaced just days later.\n\nNFL Hall of Famer Terry Bradshaw \u201ccan\u2019t stand\u201d players like Antonio Brown, and wouldn\u2019t throw to him if he were on his team. (AP/Steven Senne)\n\nIt\u2019s that extra baggage, Bradshaw said, that makes him not want to have anything to do with Brown \u2014 even knowing how good he can be on the field.\n\nIn fact, he wishes the Steelers dumped Brown years ago.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWinning football games is all about the team and all about players caring about one another and everybody pulling together, not pulling apart,\u201d Bradshaw said, via the Tribune-Review. \u201cYou can\u2019t have Antonio Brown for all the greatness that they are \u2014 do you want the baggage that goes with that crap? I wouldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad they got rid of him and I\u2019m upset now that I knew he got away \u2026 [with what] he was doing there. I wish the heck they would have gotten rid of him a long time ago.\u201d\n\nAs for Brown\u2019s future in the league?\n\n\u201cLet New England have him,\u201d Bradshaw said, via the Tribune-Review. \u201cMaybe he becomes Billy Graham, I don\u2019t know. I seriously doubt it, seriously doubt it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not pulling for him, I can promise you that.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "NFL Hall of Famer Terry Bradshaw \u201ccan\u2019t stand\u201d players like Antonio Brown, and wouldn\u2019t throw to him if he were on his team.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YI.OppMQkX.t_IoHCITSCQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KDE3VFg_BZnalDl00UdLjg--~B/aD0zMDAxO3c9NDUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/383ecc50-d678-11e9-a77f-4d986333a884", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
