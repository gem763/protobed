a key lesson from the Lakanal House fire in 2009, when six people died.\n\nSir Martin also took exception to Ms Cotton's evidence that she would not change anything about the response of the fire service on the night.\n\n\"Quite apart from its remarkable insensitivity to the families of the deceased and to those who escaped from their burning homes with their lives,\" he said, \"the Commissioner's evidence that she would not change anything about the response of the LFB on the night, even with the benefit of hindsight, only serves to demonstrate that the LFB is an institution at risk of not learning the lessons of the Grenfell Tower fire.\"\n\nHe also said Ms Cotton's evidence \"betrayed an unwillingness to confront the fact that by 2017 the LFB knew [even if she personally did not] that there was a more than negligible risk of a serious fire in a high rise building with a cladding system\".\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nMs Cotton announced her retirement in June.\n\nAn LFB spokeswoman said: \"The Inquiry's findings are not being published until Wednesday morning and it would be inappropriate for us to comment on them until then.\"\n\nAn inquiry spokeswoman said the chairman and whole team were \"dismayed and disappointed\" that media had \"chosen to deprive those most affected by the fire - the bereaved, survivors and residents - the opportunity to read the report at their own pace and without the distraction of public discussion and commentary ahead of publication\".\n\nThose given early sight of the report on Monday were forced to sign non-disclosure agreements to prevent it being leaked. It is not known whether these will now remain in place.\n\nShe added: \"The inquiry has no further comment to make at this time.\"\n\nThe inquiry's second phase is due to start in the new year.", "description": "The public inquiry's first report into the blaze, due to be published on Wednesday, identified \"systemic\" failures by the London Fire Brigade", "authors": ["Joe Gammie", "Jemma Crew", "Elaine Mccahill", "Image", "Sipa Usa Pa Images", "Getty", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article17555178.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_Grenfell-fire-anniversary-in-London-UK-14-Jun-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
