Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard will be making an appearance again after missing the last debate and billionaire Tom Steyer will also take the stage for the first time with the other candidates.\n\nSome analysts have predicted a breakthrough night from Gabbard, despite the fact that her performances have hardly been standout ones in the past few months. In earlier debates, she told Sen. Kamala Harris that \"people suffered under her reign\" as Attorney General of California. Recently, she criticized Sen. Elizabeth Warren for what she characterized as a lack of leadership ability. It\u2019s fair to say she\u2019s on the offensive, probably as a visibility strategy, but not every move is going down well. Most notably, her impeachment views have set her apart from the field in a bad way: she told the Hill\u2019s show Rising that the transcript of Trump\u2019s Ukraine call doesn\u2019t make a \u201ccompelling\u201d case for impeachment. It will be interesting to see how this goes down on a live debate stage.\n\nIt will be equally interesting to watch billionaire hedge fund founder Tom Steyer, who also founded the political groups Need to Impeach and NextGen America, stand alongside progressive peers tomorrow. Steyer has been pushing for Trump\u2019s impeachment since 2017, and NextGenAmerica, along with the Sierra Club, was one of the first backers of the Green New Deal. Steyer shouldn\u2019t be so easily dismissed by political pundits or the public, either. He represents the polar opposite of Trump on policy and, if he were to go on to seriously compete in the 2020 or 2024 elections, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time an extremely wealthy political outsider ran for the White House on a platform of radical change.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut the real focus tomorrow night is on the three septuagenarians who are leading in the polls: former VP Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and Sen. Bernie Sanders. Warren was already rising steadily before the Ukraine scandal stained former VP Joe Biden\u2019s campaign with allegations of corruption and nepotism, and before Sen. Bernie Sander\u2019s heart attack earlier this month. But with the Democratic primary starting in February of next year, it is looking more and more like Democrats just might nominate their second ever female presidential candidate to the presidency \u2013 and it won\u2019t be Tulsi Gabbard.\n\nBiden and Sanders are Warren\u2019s two lead contenders for the Party nomination, but they\u2019re waning. The full details of Sanders\u2019s heart attack haven\u2019t been made known to his staffers, let alone the public, and he\u2019s already trailing in third place in most polls. And while it\u2019s unlikely Warren or Sanders will call Biden out tomorrow night for getting his son a job on the board of a Ukrainian energy company (right after that country\u2019s revolution in 2014 and in spite of Hunter Biden\u2019s lack of experience in the industry), it\u2019s likely one of the other candidates will.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that Warren\u2019s showing tomorrow night will help to make her case as best candidate for the nomination, even if she isn\u2019t leading the polls. The question could well then shift to which of the other presidential hopefuls onstage (if any) is the right person to be Warren\u2019s VP running mate \u2014 as well as who might actually want that job.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Cory Booker of New Jersey would be ideal \u2013 he\u2019s got all the qualities and preparation necessary that Warren needs as her go-to person in the White House and on the campaign trail. And if she hasn\u2019t been convinced by the New Jersey senator\u2019s debate performance, which has been consistently strong, I suggest Warren and her team watch the fascinating documentary about Booker\u2019s plight to become mayor of Newark, New Jersey.\n\nThe film, titled Street Fight, portrays a man of intelligence, character, perseverance and dedication to his community. There is no two-faced dealing, no double standard with Booker; he comes off as real and empathetic, trustworthy, values-driven, transparent, and honorable.\n\nThe Stanford and Yale-educated Booker personifies the ideals of public service work \u2013 a message that is on point with Warren\u2019s historical plight to serve her constituents in the face of corporate interests. Booker is also in third place for Democratic endorsements according to FiveThirtyEight. Warren is currently in fourth place, so she could use the boost in her push for the presidency.\n\nHopefully the Democratic electorate is ready to support a Warren-Booker ticket. It may be the Dems' only chance to defeat Trump in the 2020 elections, with or without an impeachment.", "description": "It\u2019s set to be a crowded night tomorrow evening during the fourth round of the Democratic presidential debates with 12 candidates onstage \u2013 the most this year.
