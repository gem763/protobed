REUTERS/Sarah Marsh\n\nJose Daniel Ferrer, leader of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), was detained in the eastern city of Santiago de Cuba on Oct. 1 after a police raid on his home which also serves as the group\u2019s headquarters, UNPACU activists told Reuters.\n\n\u201cCuban authorities have imprisoned, harassed and intimidated Jos\u00e9 Daniel Ferrer Garc\u00eda for more than a decade due to his political activism,\u201d Amnesty said, recalling that he was held incommunicado for more than 10 days last year.\n\nFerrer should be informed of the charges or otherwise released, have access to lawyers and medical care and be able to communicate with his family, Amnesty said.\n\nFerrer was one of the 75 dissidents arrested in 2003 during a nationwide crackdown known as the Black Spring. He was released on parole in 2011 and soon after formed UNPACU.\n\nFerrer\u2019s partner, Nelva Ismarays Ortega, said that during a visit Ferrer told her police threatened to charge him with a fabricated common crime so he would not be heralded as a political prisoner.\n\n\u201cThey told him they were fed up with his activism ... and that they were very uncomfortable with how he\u2019d supported the measures of the U.S. government against the Castro regime,\u201d Ortega told Reuters by phone.\n\nOrtega said authorities would not allow her to give Ferrer his medication for conditions such as the chronic gastroenteritis developed during his eight years in jail.\n\n\u201cHe was in a lot of pain,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he said he wasn\u2019t afraid, and he was prepared to spend more years in jail as long as the truth were known.\u201d\n\nCuba\u2019s Communist government, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, does not discuss police activity such as the detention of dissidents, whom it dismisses as provocateurs financed by the United States.\n\nThe government regularly detains them for a few hours or days, in what rights activists describe as a long-running campaign of harassment and repression. But a detention of more than a week is unusual, especially for a prominent figure.\n\nCritics say the government appears to be tightening control, fearing unrest over deepening economic woes especially since internet service was expanded, increasing access to information and the ability to mobilize.", "description": "Amnesty International on Tuesday demanded the Cuban government explain the charges against the head of the country's largest opposition group, whom Havana arrested a week ago, or release him from jail.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438625330&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF971Y8", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
