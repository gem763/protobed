European Central Bank vice president said he didn't expect the euro zone, which has been hit badly through its exposure to Chinese and British demand trends, to slip into recession.\n\nOver the weekend, it became clear that the deal agreed between U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators was little more than a needed to manage expectations.\n\n\u201cThere is a five week period for the two sides to write down exactly what they agreed to in the meeting,\u201d said ING economist Iris Pang in a morning note. \u201cThis raises questions about how much \"progress\" has really been made.\u201d\n\nWith the market bracing for an earnings season that is expected by many to show profits falling among European companies, the need for a breakthrough on Brexit has seldom been greater. But that too looks to be up in the air after the EU\u2019s top negotiator reportedly told EU diplomats at the weekend that the U.K.\u2019s latest proposals on managing the Irish border after Brexit weren\u2019t workable.\n\nThe gloom in public markets has at least presented some opportunities for those with deep pockets and longer investment horizons. U.K. cyber-security firm Sophos Group (LON: ) said Monday it had agreed to be bought by private equity company Thoma Bravo in a deal that values it at $3.9 billion including debt. The shares shot up by over 35% in response, back to the level they were at in June.\n\nSophos has had a choppy time since listing back in 2015 with a valuation of roughly one billion pounds, although it swung to a profit for the first time in four years in its last fiscal year, and appeared to have exited a soft patch for revenue growth caused by a switch in billing patterns to monthly subscriptions.", "description": "StockBeat:  2nd Thoughts on Trade, Brexit Bring Markets Back to Earth", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEEA60N7_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
