Under then coach Eddie Jones, it became the first nation not to make the quarterfinal stage after winning three group matches at the competition.\n\nA study conducted by YouGov in 2013 found that 21% of the Japanese population liked rugby -- a figure that has no doubt grown somewhat with the team's success and hosting of this tournament.\n\nThis result will also boost a tournament that, like so many large sporting events, often relies on the success of its host nation. England can attest to this after it was forced to watch the later stages of the 2015 edition on television after crashing out in the group stage.\n\n\ud83e\udd24 Can't stop watching!

Speaking ahead of the game, players confessed to nerves from the extra weight of expectation that been placed upon them.\n\nPerhaps that explains the team's opening to this contest against Russia, a team it had beaten in five of the six previous meetings between the teams.\n\nRussia, ranked 20th in the world, only qualified for the tournament in May last year after Spain, Belgium and Romania were sanctioned for fielding ineligible players.\n\nThe third lowest ranked side in the tournament, its Welsh coach Lyn Jones believes Russia is a \"sleeping giant of rugby.\"\n\nKirill Golosnitskiy of Russia dives to score his side's first try during the Rugby World Cup.\n\nThat may well be proved true, one day. But if sleeping giants could dream, then surely it would involve scoring the first try of the World Cup against the host nation.\n\nFew had expected Russia to give Japan too many problems, so when Kirill Golosnitskiy ran through to score, easily converted by Yury Kushnarev, there were more than a few eyebrows raised.\n\nPerversely, that setback appeared to ease Japan's nerves. Gradually, those in the red and white began to move more freely.\n\nIt took seven minutes for Japan to score a try of their own with Matsushima touching down after Timothy Lafaele had created space with a wonderfully timed offload.\n\nThough it missed the resulting conversion, Japan, by now playing at a level which Russia struggled to live with, was in full control.\n\nA young Japan fan cheers on the team before the Japan 2019 Rugby World Cup Pool A match between Japan and Russia.\n\nStreaking clear\n\nWhere Russia had once looked sprightly and able to break in the opening half hour, its players now stumbled around the field, throwing arms at shadows as Japan danced to the beat of the Taiko drum -- strong, fast and unrelenting.\n\nAs halftime grew nearer, Russia finally succumbed to the inevitable.\n\nHaving already seen a try ruled out for an infringement, Japan's Matsushima took advantage of the extra space to run through for his second of the game. Yu Tamara's conversion added an extra two points to give Japan a 12-7 lead at the break.\n\nBuoyed by that try, Japan began the second half in similar fashion with Yu's penalty extending his side's lead to eight points.\n\nPieter Labuschagne of Japan scores his team's third try.\n\nTwo minutes later and Japan scored again, this time flanker Pieter Labuschagne grabbing the ball away from the Russians and charging for the line.\n\nAt last, daylight. Matsushima added his third try of the game with 12 minutes remaining to add some further gloss and extend Japan's lead to 20 points.\n\nThat fourth try, which secured a bonus point, may yet prove crucial given the more strenuous tests that lie in wait for the host nation.\n\nIreland, the world's No.1 ranked team, are next up a week on Saturday, with Samoa and Scotland also likely prove difficult opposition.\n\nBut then again, they also said that about South Africa.
