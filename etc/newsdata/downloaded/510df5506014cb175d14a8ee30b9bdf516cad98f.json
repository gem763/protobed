(Scott Taetsch/Getty Images)\n\nSports columnist\n\nWhen the ball left Kelsey Plum\u2019s fingers and the final buzzer went off \u2014 with the outcome still in the balance \u2014 it was official: These WNBA playoffs would be unlike both the Washington Mystics\u2019 regular season and their run to last year\u2019s Finals. There are matters both practical and logistical that make those things true, and they were central to the postseason opener for a team that considers a championship as the only acceptable result.\n\nThe playoffs are flat-out harder than what was a cakewalk of a regular season for the Mystics, and Plum\u2019s last-second heave that could have forced overtime was just one heart-stopping reminder.\n\n\u201cStressful,\u201d said Mystics star Elena Delle Donne, who missed what could have been a clinching shot and then guarded Plum on the running heave that didn\u2019t fall. All of that opened the best-of-five semifinal series against the Las Vegas Aces with a harrowing 97-95 victory for Washington that had just about everything, including the ingredient the Mystics\u2019 regular season romp didn\u2019t: drama.\n\n[Playoff pressure doesn\u2019t dent the Mystics in their playoff opener, a 97-95 win]\n\nAs important, though, as the result of that shot was the building in which Plum took it \u2014 Entertainment and Sports Arena in Southeast Washington. It is a stage and an advantage the Mystics had no idea was possible a year ago.\n\nSo, consider the ingredients. These Mystics have swagger. They have skill. They have the searing experience of reaching the Finals and not winning the title. And they have a home.\n\nThat\u2019s quite a combination. Yet the way in which the Mystics began their run to what they hope will be the franchise\u2019s first trophy wasn\u2019t how they have become accustomed to playing. This was difficult, in all the right ways. The favorites were pressed, and hard. They responded, buoyed not only by Emma Meesseman\u2019s 27 points and 10 rebounds and Delle Donne\u2019s all-around excellence \u2014 including a key bucket with about half a minute left \u2014 but by a crowd that recognizes what could be coming over the next few weeks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten to a position where we\u2019re No. 1 and everyone\u2019s looking to come at us,\u201d Delle Donne said. \u201cBut that\u2019s where we want to be.\u201d\n\nThey are there, with reason. Put aside the anxiety of the final moments Tuesday and think about how the Mystics entered these playoffs, not just as the top seed, not just as winners of 17 of their past 19 games, not just on a 10-game home winning streak. No, they were throttling teams and stepping on necks.\n\nSince mid-July, when that 19-game finishing kick started, they had won 13 times by double digits. Their 26 victories over the course of the season came by an average of \u2014 get this \u2014 19.5 points. They took the mantle of favorites \u2014 a status gained in part because of their run to the Finals last season, where they lost to Seattle \u2014 and gave it a big ol\u2019 hug.\n\n\u201cThey had a target on their backs since the first game of the season,\u201d Coach Mike Thibault said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been a favorite or one of the co-favorites for a long time. And yet we\u2019ve kept winning.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s admirable. It also means nothing right about now. Go up 13 in the fourth quarter, as Washington did Tuesday, and a playoff opponent is likely to have a shot to tie or win it at the buzzer, as Las Vegas did.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s playoff time now,\u201d Delle Donne said, \u201cso there probably won\u2019t be blowouts.\u201d\n\nThe first game wasn\u2019t, and Plum\u2019s leaner at the buzzer not only made that point obvious but was the exclamation point on so many harrowing moments that led to it. Start with Plum\u2019s buzzer-beating jumper at the end of the second quarter, the shot that put Las Vegas up seven. The crowd of 3,968, so enthusiastic for so much of the night, fell quiet.\n\n[Pregame antics and late-game frustration give Aces something to build on]\n\nWait, about that crowd. This is the Mystics\u2019 crowd, because this is the Mystics\u2019 arena, a brand new one to boot. That mattered throughout the season, when Washington dominated at home, and it mattered Tuesday night.\n\nYes, a ridiculous 8:30 p.m. tip-off time on a school night \u2014 hello, ESPN! \u2014 meant the game wasn\u2019t a sellout. But considering where the Mystics were last fall, literally meandering to the Finals, this was a comforting feeling. The team\u2019s old home court was cavernous Capital One Arena \u2014 too big, too impersonal, too (shhhhhhh) quiet. Kicked out of that building as it underwent renovations, the Mystics played at George Washington University\u2019s Smith Center, then finished out the finals against Seattle at George Mason\u2019s EagleBank Arena, out in the Virginia \u2019burbs.\n\nThere was, all along the way, a following. But the Mystics believe having a true home influenced their season.\n\n\u201cBeing [14-3] in this building says a lot about what it\u2019s given us,\u201d Thibault said. \u201cAt the start, it\u2019s still our skill level that has to be good to do that. But the fans have had a direct influence on the game. It energizes the team from the time you walk into the building.\u201d\n\nIt energized the Mystics at halftime Tuesday. They opened the third quarter by scoring the first seven points, erasing the Las Vegas lead. When guard Natasha Cloud celebrated a bucket by flexing and yelling, it wasn\u2019t into the abyss. It was to the throngs along the baseline \u2014 including Wizards guard John Wall \u2014 who screamed along with her.\n\nFrom there, the Mystics pushed the lead to 13 in the fourth quarter. When Las Vegas cut it to two, they found a way. Not one of them. All of them.\n\n\u201cI just feel like they have a confidence about themselves because they trust each other to do their jobs,\u201d Thibault said. \u201cThey trust each other to make shots. I don\u2019t think any one player on this team feels the pressure to win it all by themselves.\u201d\n\nThey didn\u2019t Tuesday. Meesseman was central, and everything for Washington runs through Delle Donne, the MVP candidate, who added 24 points, six rebounds and six assists. But watch what LaToya Sanders did against a hulking Las Vegas lineup, scrapping for nine points, five boards and five steals. Veteran guard Kristi Toliver eased herself back into the rotation from injury and looked uneasy \u2014 but buried a massive three-pointer late in the third.\n\nBut it took Delle Donne\u2019s bucket with 32.9 seconds left to provide the Mystics\u2019 last points. And then it took watching Plum\u2019s final shot.\n\n\u201cWow\u201d was Thibault\u2019s from-the-gut reaction. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s better just to survive.\u201d\n\nThe regular season is over, and the string of blowouts might be, too. That\u2019s okay. The Mystics \u2014 and their very own home crowd \u2014 are ready for whatever\u2019s next.", "description": "As Washington opened the postseason with a narrow victory over Las Vegas, the impact of Entertainment and Sports Arena was obvious.", "authors": ["Barry Svrluga", "Sports Columnist With Beat Writing Experience On Baseball", "Golf", "The Nfl", "College Basketball", "College Football", "Sports Columnist", "September At Pm", "Barry Svrluga Became A Sports Columnist For The Washington Post In December He Arrived At The Post In To Cover Football", "Basketball At The University Of Maryland"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/seCe_Puh-vM8YWdJ1atnDXyQc5M=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XX27H5GZYEI6TJUIGA3JH62LBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
