The report, dated Sept. 13., was delivered to the office of Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa., who was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee until last year.\n\nThe report reflected only approximately 30,000 emails that the State Department was able to physically review, and found 38 individuals were responsible for 91 violations.\n\nAnother 497 violations were also found, although the report was not able to assign responsibility in those cases, in part because many of those involved had already left the department during the time it took to receive the emails and review them.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON FLOATS CONSPIRACY THAT TULSI GABBARD IS BEING 'GROOMED' BY RUSSIANS\n\nThe report described an investigation fraught with obstacles -- including delays -- employees who left the department and more than 30,000 deleted records.\n\nThe Clinton email controversy dogged her throughout her failed 2016 presidential bid. Clinton and her aides have claimed the controversy was overblown and denied any wrongdoing, but President Trump and allies have consistently referred back to it as an example of a criminal endeavor for which no one was properly punished.\n\nThe FBI began investigating Clinton\u2019s handling of emails in 2015 after it was revealed she had used a homebrew server for her government emails. Then-FBI Director James Comey announced in July 2016 that the agency would not recommend charges, but famously described Clinton as having been \"extremely careless\" in her conduct.\n\nThe department received the emails in December 2014, well after Clinton left the department in early 2013.\n\nThe department concluded that the use of a private email system \u201cadded an increased degree of risk of compromise, as a private system lacks the network monitoring and intrusion detection capabilities of [the] State Department.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the use of a private email system itself did not necessarily increase the likelihood of classified information being transmitted on unclassified systems, those incidents which then resulted in the presence of classified information upon it carried an increased risk of compromise or inadvertent disclosure,\u201d the report said.\n\nHowever, while there were instances of classified information being introduced into an unclassified system, the report said that by and large the individuals interviewed \u201cdid their best\u201d to implement security policies. There was no \u201cpersuasive evidence\u201d of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information, according to the report.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "A State Department report into former Secretary of State\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server for government business, obtained by Fox News on Friday, found dozens of individuals at fault and hundreds of security violations", "authors": ["Catherine Herridge", "Catherine Herridge Is An Award-Winning Chief Intelligence Correspondent For Fox News Channel", "Fnc", "Based In Washington", "D.C.
