The game was due to kick off at 12:15 p.m. local time Sunday at the Kamaishi Recovery Memorial Stadium (late Saturday night in Canada).\n\n\"I think it's still sinking in,\" a disappointed Canada coach Kingsley Jones said. \"It's a unique situation at test [match] level. It doesn't happen very often, if ever. But it's happened.\"\n\n\"It is what it is. We accept the reasons as well,\" he added.\n\nWorld Rugby issued a statement saying an evacuation order remained in place in the Kamaishi area and there had been landslides and flooding in the vicinity of the stadium.\n\n\"The safety of all involved in Rugby World Cup 2019 is our primary consideration and fans are advised not to travel to Kamaishi or the venue, which will be closed,\" World Rugby said.\n\nThe Canadian team, which is slated to leave for home Monday, was restricted to its hotel early Sunday.\n\nSchedule havoc\n\nTwo of Saturday's three scheduled games \u2014 New Zealand against Italy and England against France \u2014 were cancelled well before the destructive typhoon made landfall. Organizers eventually decided to go ahead with Scotland versus Japan in Yokohama later Sunday.\n\nCancelled matches are logged as 0-0 ties, and teams get two competition points each.\n\nCanada, ranked 22nd in the world, had targeted the game against No. 23 Namibia as its best chance at a victory.\n\nA goalpost and debris are swept downstream from the overflowing Tamagawa river, following the aftermath of Typhoon Hagibis, in Kawasaki, on Sunday in Japan.

While the teams were tied at two points apiece, Namibia finished fourth in the pool ahead of Canada on points difference (minus-141 for Namibia and minus-163 for Canada).\n\n\"We completely understand the decision given the conditions we're facing here,\" Canadian media manager Gareth Rees said in a video showing the wind-whipped waves on Kamaishi.\n\nWorld Rugby said the decision was forced upon it.\n\nNo option but to cancel\n\n\"Following extensive discussions with World Rugby, Kamaishi City and Iwate Prefecture, during which we considered every possibility to make this game happen, in the end we had no option but to cancel the match to ensure the safety of the fans, team, volunteers, and all others involved,\" organizing committee chief executive Akira Shimazu said.\n\n\"It was both a difficult and emotional decision to make, however I feel it's the right decision and firmly believe both domestic and foreign fans will understand the decision was made to ensure safety.\"\n\nThe Canadian men, who went 0-4-0 at the 2015 tournament, have not won a game at the world Cup since a 25-20 victory over Tonga at the 2011 competition. They have lost their last eight tournament matches, outscored 387-87 in the process.\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency had forecast the typhoon to be the worst to hit Japan in six decades. It brought heavy rainfall in wide areas of Japan all day ahead of its landfall early Saturday evening, and continued to batter parts of the main island with heavy winds and torrents of rain overnight.\n\nAn earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.7 shook the areas drenched by the rainfall, shortly before the typhoon made landfall in Shizuoka prefecture.", "description": "Canada will leave the Rugby World Cup winless for the second straight tournament, with the weather tying its hands this time.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5319793.1570932354!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/canada-south-africa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
