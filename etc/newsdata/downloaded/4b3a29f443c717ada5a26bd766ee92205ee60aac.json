In fact I\u2019ve got a meeting about it tomorrow.\n\n\u201cFor safety they reduced the speed limit around the fence and this made a lot of people furious. But it was only ever going to be temporary.\n\n\u201cSome were not patient enough and hated the teddy bears so much they decided to cut them down and toss them over the fence.\u201d\n\nmedia_camera The toys scattered over the fence after its destruction.
