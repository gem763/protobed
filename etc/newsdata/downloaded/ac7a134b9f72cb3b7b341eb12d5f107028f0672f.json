Barr gather information for a Justice Department inquiry that Mr. Trump hopes will discredit the Mueller investigation, according to two American officials with knowledge of the call.\n\nThe White House restricted access to the call\u2019s transcript to a small group of the president\u2019s aides, one of the officials said, an unusual decision that is similar to the handling of a July call with the Ukrainian president that is at the heart of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump. Like that call, the discussion with Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia shows the extent to which Mr. Trump sees the attorney general as a critical partner in his goal to show that the Mueller investigation had corrupt and partisan origins, and the extent that Mr. Trump sees the Justice Department inquiry as a potential way to gain leverage over America\u2019s closest allies.\n\nAnd like the call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, the discussion with Mr. Morrison shows the president using high-level diplomacy to advance his personal political interests.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Trump-Australia-Barr-Mueller.Html Smid Tw-Nytimes Smtyp Cur"], "top_image": ""}
