Police found two assault rifles in her apartment in Novi Sad, during a raid last week.\n\nThat was only the beginning, however. The real motherlode was struck during the second raid, at the house of her acquaintance Svetozar Zivkovic in the village of Bajmok near Subotica. There, police confiscated eleven Kalashnikovs, 11 air pistols converted to firearms, ten silencers, and a large quantity of ammunition, according to the Serbian Ministry of Interior (MUP). They identified Zivkovic, 59, as a citizen of Sweden.\n\nKecman, 25, is a small-time singer better known for her risque Instagram photos, which have managed to attract over 20,000 followers. She is often photographed in the company of more famous local music and film personalities.\n\nOne of the confiscated rifles was covered with white varnish, Serbian tabloids reported citing an anonymous police source, adding that this \u201ctrick\u201d is often used by criminals to make the weapons easier to burn and thus cover their tracks.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Montenegrin newspaper Borba claimed that the weapons may have been intended for the so-called Skaljar Clan, an organized crime group based in Kotor. The Skaljars have reportedly been feuding with another Kotor-based gang since 2014, over the disappearance of some 200 kilos of cocaine from their safehouse from Valencia, Spain.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
