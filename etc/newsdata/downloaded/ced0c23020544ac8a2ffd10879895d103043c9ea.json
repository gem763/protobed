(AP) - Three-time world champion Nyjah Huston of Laguna Beach tops the 2020 USA Skateboarding National Team heading into the sport\u2019s Olympic debut in Tokyo next summer.\n\nThe 24-year-old Huston is considered the gold medal favorite in men\u2019s street.\n\nSkaters named to the national team Sunday will receive support from USA Skateboarding but still have to earn an Olympic berth through various qualifying contests.\n\nHuston is coming off a victory in the world championships last month in Sao Paulo.\n\n\u201cWithout a doubt, winning the world championship and finishing on top of the world skateboard rankings in September cemented him as the leader in Olympic qualifying, not just in the United States but in the world right now,\u201d USA Skateboarding CEO Josh Friedberg said.\n\n\u201cNyjah is an unbelievable competitor. He thrives under the pressure of big-time competitions and I think that it would not be surprising in any way, shape or form to see him get a gold medal in Tokyo.\u201d\n\nThe 2020 team was announced after the 2019 national championships concluded Sunday. Huston didn\u2019t need to compete because he\u2019s amassed enough points.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a crazy time for skateboarding,\u201d Huston said. \u201cTo think it took this long to get into the Olympics with skating being such an active sport world-wide, with all the kids who skate, I\u2019m thankful I\u2019m at a point in my career where I can hopefully get out there and represent my country, and nail it. It\u2019s sick.\u201d\n\nWinners of Sunday\u2019s finals were Dashawn Jordan of Chandler, Arizona, in men\u2019s street; Tristan Rennie of Rialto in men\u2019s park; Mariah Duran of Albuquerque, New Mexico, in women\u2019s street; and Bryce Wettstein of Encinitas in women\u2019s park. The contest was the first chance for American skaters to earn points for the second qualifying season.\n\nFriedberg said there is so much depth among American skaters that \u201cessentially at this point if you\u2019re on the national team it\u2019s because we believe you have a chance of making the podium in Tokyo. There\u2019s some variance on some of the skaters. Some are kind of developing now. Overall the reason we\u2019re supporting them is we believe they have that capability. This season it\u2019s up to them to prove it to themselves.\u201d\n\nJoining Huston on the national team in men\u2019s street are Jordan; Jagger Eaton of Mesa, Arizona; Jamie Foy of Deerfield Beach; and Maurio McCoy of Reading, Pennsylvania.\n\nJoining Duran in women\u2019s street are Lacey Baker of Covina; Samarria Brevard of Riverside; Alexis Sablone of Old Saybrook, Connecticut; and Alana Smith of Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nRennie is joined on the men\u2019s park squad by Cory Juneau of San Diego; Heimana Reynolds of Honolulu; Tom Schaar of Malibu; Alex Sorgente of Lake Worth, Florida; and Zion Wright of Jupiter, Florida.\n\nWettstein is joined on the women\u2019s park team by Jordyn Barratt of Haleiwa, Hawaii; Ariana Carmona of Buena Park; Jordan Santana of Houston; Minna Stess of Petaluma; and Brighton Zeuner of Encinitas.\n\nThe United States can send a maximum of three skaters per gender, per discipline, to Tokyo.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Three-time world champion Nyjah Huston of Laguna Beach tops the 2020 USA Skateboarding National Team heading into the sport's Olympic debut in Tokyo next summer.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bernie Wilson"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
