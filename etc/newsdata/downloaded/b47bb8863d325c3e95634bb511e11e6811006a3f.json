He has been charged with rioting, which carries a maximum 10-year sentence, and assaulting an officer. Tsang is in stable condition in hospital.\n\nThe shooting enraged protesters who rampaged across the city, throwing petrol bombs, blocking roads and starting fires as police responded with tear gas.\n\n\n\n\n\n'MORE SERIOUS'\n\nEven before the new rules were confirmed, protests against them began across the Asian financial hub, with hundreds of office workers wearing masks gathering to march. \"Police brutality is becoming more serious and the set up of an anti-mask law is to threaten us from protesting,\" said one protester, who asked to be identified as just Chan, a 27-year-old financial industry worker.\n\nPro-Beijing groups had been pushing for legislation to ban face masks at demonstrations.\n\nThe protesters are angry about what they see as creeping interference by Beijing in their city's affairs despite a promise of autonomy in the \"one country, two systems\" formula under which Hong Kong returned to China in 1997.\n\nChina dismisses accusations it is meddling and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of stirring up anti-China sentiment.\n\nWhat began as opposition to a proposed extradition law, that could have seen people sent for trial in mainland courts, has grown into a call for five demands, including universal suffrage and an inquiry into alleged police brutality.\n\nThe protests have been inflamed by the police shooting of a teenaged secondary school student on Tuesday during a clash, and more rallies are expected later in the evening and over the weekend.\n\nAuthorities have already loosened guidelines on the use of force by police, according to documents seen by Reuters.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Twinnie Siu, James Pomfret and Felix Tam; Writing by Farah Master Editing by Anne Marie Roantree, Robert Birsel)", "description": "Hong Kong's government is set to ban face masks at protests, media reported on Friday, as it struggles to end months of violent unrest in the Chinese-ruled city.
