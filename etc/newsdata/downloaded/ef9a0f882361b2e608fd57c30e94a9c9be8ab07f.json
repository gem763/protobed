Net profit rose 9% to GBP1.6 billion.\n\nFor the full year, Glaxo now expects adjusted EPS to be flat at constant exchange rates, having previously said it expected a fall of 3% to 5%.\n\nGlaxo attributed the strong performance, and the upgrade, to better-than-expected sales of some vaccines and newer drugs, as well as a tax boost.\n\nThose factors overcame two big drags on profits.\n\nThe company has increased its spending on research as Chief Executive Emma Walmsley works to revitalize Glaxo's pipeline of branded prescription drugs. At the same time, Glaxo is for the first time facing low-cost competition for its best-selling inhaler Advair, which treats asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\nAdvair lost patent protection in 2010 but went unchallenged for nearly a decade due to the difficulties of making a generic version of an inhalable drug. That changed earlier this year, when Mylan NV (MYL) started selling a cut-price version.\n\nThe new competition hit Advair sales hard in the third quarter. U.S. revenue for the treatment fell 62% to GBP117 million, dragging global revenue for the product down 32% to GBP418 million.\n\nDespite that, Glaxo's total revenue climbed 16% to GBP9.4 billion in the third quarter, thanks to strong sales of newer HIV drugs and the vaccine Shingrix.\n\nThe addition of products from Pfizer Inc.'s (PFE) consumer health-care business, which started contributing to sales in August, also boosted revenue. Glaxo and Pfizer announced a deal to combine their consumer health units in December last year and the deal closed in August.\n\nWrite to Denise Roland at denise.roland@wsj.com and Carlo Martuscelli at carlo.martuscelli@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 30, 2019 09:41 ET (13:41 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
