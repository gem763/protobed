They now go into a double-header with Chelsea with hopes they can repeat last season\u2019s thrilling run, which saw them dump out Real Madrid and Juventus before falling to Spurs in the last four.\n\n\u201cWe have to forget that (last season) now because we live in the future. We live now. And now we have to perform,\u201d Ten Hag told reporters ahead of Wednesday\u2019s match at the Johan Cruyff Arena.\n\nTen Hag\u2019s side look to have brushed off last year\u2019s disappointment, as they are unbeaten in all competitions and top of the Eredivisie averaging more than three goals a game.\n\n\u201cLast year was last year, we\u2019re building a new team \u2026 we start the season very well and now we have to step up and become game-to-game better,\u201d added Ten Hag.\n\nStanding in his side\u2019s way in the next two group games is a rapidly developing Chelsea team that is packed with home-grown talent and on a run of five straight wins in all competitions.\n\nFrank Lampard has reinvigorated a Blues side that lost Eden Hazard in the summer with players like Fikayo Tomori and Tammy Abraham, with Callum Hudson-Odoi back in the mix after a long-term ankle injury.\n\n\u201cWhen I see them they want to play football, they want to play in the opponents\u2019 half, they want to press high and they want to stay in the opponents\u2019 half. That\u2019s pretty similar to Ajax,\u201d said Ten Hag.\n\n\u201cI think they want to go as far as we did, but of course we want to avoid that.\u201d\n\nAbraham has starred with eight goals in nine league appearances and got the opener in Chelsea\u2019s 2-1 win at Lille, and is set to start at one of the homes of youth development.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing very well at the moment, he\u2019s a good striker,\u201d said Ajax defender Daley Blind, a former Manchester United player.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll prepare myself as I always do, you have to defend not just against a striker but a whole team, and we attack as a team and defend like a team.\u201d", "description": "Amsterdam (AFP) \u2013 Erik ten Hag insisted on Tuesday that his Ajax side have put last season\u2019s Champions League heartbreak behind them as they", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/22/7f73c5_erik-ten-hag-ajax-started-season-thrilling-football-played-campaign-ten-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
