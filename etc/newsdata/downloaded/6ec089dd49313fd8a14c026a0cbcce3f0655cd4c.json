He denies all accusations of wrongdoing.\n\nHis unlicensed Nessma TV has for several years been making frequent broadcasts that show Karoui distributing charity in the poorest parts of Tunisia.\n\nHis focus on poverty has won him the support of many poor voters, while his business-friendly approach has also attracted richer Tunisians.\n\nSunday's vote is the third national election in five weeks, following the first-round of the presidential vote in September, in which Saied took 18.4% and Karoui 15.6%, and a parliamentary election a week ago.\n\nThe presidential vote was originally scheduled for November, but was accelerated by the death in July of 92-year-old Beji Caid Essebsi, the first directly elected head of state in a free election after the transition to democracy that began in 2011.\n\nLow turnout and the rejection of established politicians and parties in both the presidential and parliamentary polls have highlighted public dissatisfaction with Tunisian politics.\n\nSalmi, the student voting at the Lac polling booth, said she had not voted in either the first-round of the presidential election or in the parliamentary poll.\n\n\"But today I vote to support a candidate who will be president of all Tunisians and be fair,\" she said.\n\n(Reporting by Tarek Amara, writing by Angus McDowall; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)", "description": "Tunisians began voting for a new president on Sunday in the decisive second-round run-off of an election in which they have spurned traditional candidates in favour of a media mogul and a retired law professor who wants to remake democracy.
