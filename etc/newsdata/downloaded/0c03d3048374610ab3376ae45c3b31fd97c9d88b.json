If you\u2019re an iPad user, then Outlook is about to start supporting Split View, so you can open your email list alongside your calendar. Drag and drop support is also on the way, so you\u2019ll soon be able to drag links or text from a browser window into an Outlook email draft.\n\nAlongside the iPad additions, Outlook for iOS is finally getting the Do Not Disturb feature. This has been available on Android for what feels like forever, and its introduction on iOS will include the ability to customize work hours and days. Do Not Disturb will silence email notifications on a scheduled basis, or even just by selecting an option like \u201cUntil Tomorrow\u201d if you\u2019re not feeling like answering work emails at all hours of the night.\n\nOutlook for iOS is also getting LinkedIn integration. You\u2019ll be able to connect an account and see potential matches in the contact cards within Outlook, and this will hopefully improve the lack of profile images for email contacts that are outside of an organization or Microsoft account.\n\nThe final new addition is really useful if you move a lot of email around in Outlook mobile. Microsoft is planning to suggest folders to help Outlook for iOS users who move certain emails into specific folders. If you always move messages from a particular contact, you\u2019ll start to notice that Outlook is one step ahead of you and will suggest the folder soon.\n\nThese updates will be rolling out in the coming weeks, but Microsoft is also promising a \u201csneak peek\u201d at what\u2019s next for Outlook on iOS and Android at the company\u2019s Ignite conference next week. Ignite will also include an early look at some updates to Outlook for Mac, with one session promising an \u201cupdated user experience rolling out first to early adopters.\u201d Another session will also focus on what\u2019s next for Outlook on Windows.", "description": "Microsoft is adding some useful features to Outlook for iOS.
