During the festivities, the Earl of Wessex was bestowed the honor of cutting the cake \u2014 and did the deed in a truly bizarre way.\n\nLater, it was a happy moment for members of the local community and volunteers at Lakeland Community Care Centre, as The Earl of Wessex joined them in celebrating their 25th anniversary! \ud83c\udf70 #RoyalVisitNI pic.twitter.com/owfNnbabU2 \u2014 The Royal Family (@RoyalFamily) October 9, 2019\n\nIn a video shared by the royal family on Twitter, Prince Edward excitedly stands over the cake with a large knife aimed at the middle of it as a crowd cheers him on. After he enthusiastically yells a countdown, he shows off his unique cake-cutting skills by stabbing the confection like Buffy Summers plunging a stake into a vampire\u2019s heart.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if this is sincerely how Prince Edward cuts cake or if he was just trying to get a laugh (he has been quite goofy in public in the past), but most people on Twitter got a kick out of the royal looking like he\u2019s about to gut a fish.\n\nHahaha I love his cake cutting!!!! \u2014 CambridgeOverwatch \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 (@CambridgeOverw1) October 9, 2019\n\nDramatic cake cutting, I love it. \u2014 Vanessa Gillieo (@VanessaGillieo) October 11, 2019\n\nAnd, although the whole thing may have been done in jest, one user had a pretty valid comment:\n\nThis is a man who has never cut cake before. \u2014 Alex Nicholson (@Alex20001) October 9, 2019", "description": "The royal\u2019s tactic takes the cake when it comes to, uh, sincerely scaring someone?", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da0ffe6200000da065000ca.jpeg?cache=52lhht1tif&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
