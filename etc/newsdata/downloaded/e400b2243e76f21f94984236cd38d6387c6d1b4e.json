But Ben's feet improved overnight after trying the Palmer's Cocoa Butter, which was on sale at the budget supermarket chain\n\nAldi describes the Palmer's Cocoa Butter as being 'rich and moisturising', adding that it is 'a great solution for dry skin'\n\nMs Boyd, a 43-year-old receptionist, said: 'Absolutely nothing was working. It was absolutely heartbreaking.'\n\nAfter discovering the product in Aldi she added: 'It was brilliant, I felt like crying in the morning when I saw his feet.'\n\n'It was amazing. The next day it was like he had completely different feet. He was as shocked as me. It's made a huge difference.'\n\nShe said Ben - who has had the condition since he was born - had had countless GP appointments, but to no avail.\n\nNow Ben can run around with his younger brother Oliver, eight, once again and play sport.\n\nBen said: 'It used to be hurting, blistering and bleeding all the time. I feel way better, it's like having new feet.'\n\nMs Boyd added she hopes the cream may be able to help other children suffering with eczema.\n\n'I just want everybody to know how it's helped Ben,' said Ms Boyd, who used to have to cut off his flaking skin with nail clippers.\n\nMs Boyd, a 43-year-old receptionist, said: 'Absolutely nothing was working. It was absolutely heartbreaking' (pictured with Ben, his brother Oliver and father Gareth)\n\nMs Boyd added she hopes the cream may be able to help other children suffering with eczema - not just Ben (pictured together)\n\nAround six million people suffer from eczema in Britain, while the figure is in excess of 35 million in the US, figures suggest.\n\nThe root cause of the condition, which can cause patients to itch their skin until it is red raw, has mystified dermatologists for decades.\n\nThe main treatments for eczema are moisturisers, which are used every day to stop the skin becoming dry, according to the NHS.\n\nAldi describes the Palmer's Cocoa Butter as being 'rich and moisturising', adding that it is 'a great solution for dry skin'.\n\nLisa Bickerstaffe, British Skin Foundation spokesperson, said: 'Whilst a specific moisturising product may work well for one person with eczema, it may not have the same effect on another person with the same skin condition.\n\n'That\u2019s why it\u2019s always worth speaking with a consultant dermatologist \u2013 a specialist skin doctor \u2013 who will be able to advise the patient based on their individual situation.\n\n'Finding the right treatment, emollient or moisturiser can be a case of trial and error.'", "description": "Sarah Boyd, from Caerphilly in Wales, was devastated that 'nothing was working' to relieve Ben of his skin condition.
