If the Scots\u2019 nerves are once more fragile on November 19, a stray jumping jack is liable to have them running for cover to the dressing room like St Trinian\u2019s girls hitching up their skirts and squealing at the glimpse of a mouse.\n\nSteve Clarke has repeatedly spoken of the positives he has identified whenever his squad gathers for training, yet is patently confounded by the loss of resolve under pressure, witnessed in their three appearances this season. Against Russia at Hampden Park last month, Scotland led through John McGinn\u2019s first international goal but inexplicably began to play too deep and conceded the equaliser to Artem Dzubya before the break, on the way to a 2-1 defeat.\n\nThree days later, the 4-0 rout inflicted by Belgium at Hampden began with the breakdown of a Scottish free kick on the edge of the Belgian penalty area, speedily converted into a counter-punch inflicted by Romelu Lukaku. Clarke rued the ease with which his players were picked off despite having close to 50% of possession. That, at least, could be discounted somewhat as the consequence of playing the world\u2019s best team.", "description": "Scotland must beware any whizz-bangs left over from Fireworks Night when they complete their Euro 2020 group stage qualifying campaign against Kazakhstan at Hampden Park next month.", "authors": ["Roddy Forsyth", "Scottish Football Correspondent", "Jason Burt", "Oliver Brown"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000212661660-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BquOv8qdqAtg5F-Rc30df4dfj2qukE9H700hF5QspDRNo.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
