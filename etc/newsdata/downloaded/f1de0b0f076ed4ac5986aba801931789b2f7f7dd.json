Even in the context of increasing attacks on activists, this incident is shocking in its brutality,\" said the head of the rights group's East Asia regional office, Joshua Rosenzwei.\n\nWhat happened in parliament?\n\nOpposition lawmakers disrupted the Legislative Council (Legco) session as Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam tried to make her annual address.\n\nAfter a first interruption, the session resumed only to be interrupted again.\n\nIt was then suspended - and a pre-recorded speech by Ms Lam was made available on the Legco website instead.\n\nIt was the first time a Hong Kong chief executive had been unable to deliver a policy address in the chamber.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Watch the moment chaos erupts in Hong Kong parliament\n\nIt meant a controversial extradition bill - the trigger for the months of protests - could not be withdrawn formally.\n\nThe bill was suspended in July, but Wednesday's meeting was the first time the Legco had resumed since it was stormed by protesters in July, and was the first opportunity to withdraw the bill altogether.\n\nAs Ms Lam was about to begin her speech, opposition lawmakers began shouting and climbing on tables.\n\nThey also projected the words \"Five demands - not one less\" on the wall behind her. Since the protests began, they have widened from rallies against the bill to five key demands - including universal suffrage.\n\nOpposition lawmaker Tanya Chan said Ms Lam was to blame for Hong Kong's troubles.\n\n\"Both her hands are soaked with blood,\" she said. \"We hope Carrie Lam withdraws and quits. She has no governance ability. She is not suitable to be chief executive.\"\n\nPro-establishment lawmakers condemned the interruption of the session, saying the address was important for Hong Kong's economic future.\n\nIn the address, Ms Lam stressed her commitment to \"one country, two systems\" - the parallel political system introduced in Hong Kong after British rule ended - and said calls for Hong Kong independence would not be tolerated.\n\nShe announced several housing and infrastructure policies, saying housing was the most urgent issue the city faces.\n\nDuring a news conference after the address, Ms Lam rejected claims that her speech had ignored the demands of the protest movement.\n\nBut she said it was not the time to consider voting reform, while insisting Hong Kong did have freedom of speech and freedom of the press without Chinese interference.\n\nThe developments came just hours after Hong Kong protesters won a show of support from US lawmakers, who passed a bill aimed at upholding human rights in the city.\n\nWhat are the Hong Kong protests about?\n\nHong Kong is part of China but, as a former British colony, has some autonomy and people have more rights.\n\nThe protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would undermine the city's freedoms and judicial independence.\n\nThe government in September promised the bill would be withdrawn once parliament resumed but demonstrations continued.\n\nProtesters are now calling for five key demands:\n\nDon't characterise the protests as \"riots\"\n\nAmnesty for arrested activists\n\nAn independent inquiry into alleged police brutality\n\nImplementation of complete universal suffrage\n\nWithdrawal of the extradition bill\n\nProtests have taken place every weekend over the past month and in every district, causing widespread disruption.\n\nClashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police firing live bullets and protesters attacking officers and throwing petrol bombs.\n\nMs Lam's address was scheduled just days after Chinese President Xi Jinping said any attempt to divide China would end in \"bodies smashed and bones ground to powder\" - comments seen as an implicit warning to Hong Kong.\n\nHow did the protests escalate?", "description": "Photographs show Jimmy Sham of the Civil Human Rights Front lying in the street, covered in blood.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/11355/production/_109258407_mediaitem109258406.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
