China's blue-chip CSI300 index .CSI300 gained 1.1% while the Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC rose 1.2%.\n\nMarkets in Tokyo were closed.\n\nThe greenback, Swiss franc and Japanese yen all weakened as optimism over the trade talks, together with the European Union and Britain restarting Brexit negotiations, encouraged investors into riskier assets.\n\nThe dollar index .DXY rose 0.23%, with the euro EUR= down 0.15% to $1.1023. The Japanese yen JPY strengthened 0.02% versus the greenback at 108.40 per dollar.\n\nSterling fell 0.74% to $1.2554 GBP=, retreating from a 15-week high of $1.2708 on Friday, on optimism Britain could reach a deal on Brexit with the EU.\n\nA Brexit deal was hanging in the balance after diplomats indicated the EU wanted more concessions from Prime Minister Boris Johnson and that a full agreement was unlikely this week.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A trader works on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., October 9, 2019.
