(AP) - Tulsa and Navy are trying very hard not face another opponent in their game Saturday: An emotional hangover.\n\nTulsa blew a 30-9, fourth-quarter lead before losing in triple overtime to SMU. The Midshipmen are coming off a 34-25 win over Air Force in which they squandered a late 21-9 lead, falling behind 25-21 with 3:15 remaining before scoring the winning touchdown with 23 seconds left.\n\nBoth coaches told their teams they need to put the previous outings behind them and focus on Saturday\u2019s game.\n\nFor Tulsa (2-3, 0-1 American Athletic), the way they lost was difficult to stomach, but Golden Hurricane coach Philip Montgomery was pleased with the overall performance.\n\n\u201cI was really proud of our football team, I thought they played extremely hard, playing a very explosive and hot football team,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cI thought we played exceptionally well for three quarters, and then we just got to finish right there. One play here or there and obviously it\u2019s a different ball game, but that\u2019s the way our conference is.\u201d\n\nThe emphasis for Navy (3-1, 1-1), according to coach Ken Niumatalolo, is to not be too happy with the win.\n\n\u201cWe better move on or it\u2019s going to be a very disappointing week,\u201d Niumatalolo said. \u201c(Tulsa) is a good football team, they\u2019ve had one of the toughest schedules in the country. We better get ready to go, or this is going to be a disappointing trip.\u201d\n\nON THE ROAD AGAIN\n\nNavy has lost 14 straight games outside of Annapolis, a stretch that dates to their last trip to Tulsa, a 31-21 victory on Sept. 30, 2017. Niumatalolo doesn\u2019t view the Midshipmen as trying to get a monkey off their backs, just attempting to capitalize on their next opportunity.\n\n\u201cIt has nothing to do with a road win or monkey, we just got to win our next game\u201d he said. \u201cI never look at those things. It\u2019s the next game, we got to find a way to win it.\u201d\n\nWHAT IF?\n\nDespite numerous plays that might have clinched a victory over SMU last week, Montgomery didn\u2019t want to play the \u201cwhat if\u201d game about several key moments that didn\u2019t go their way- including the four 4th downs that SMU converted in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cHindsight 20/20, there\u2019s some different calls in there in all three phases,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the time, I wouldn\u2019t have done anything differently. But obviously, as you look back on it, you\u2019re going to be critical of yourself.\u201d\n\nTOP GROUND GAME\n\nAfter gaining 214 yards (and four touchdowns) on 50 rushes against Air Force, Navy leads the nation in rushing with an average of 312 yards per game, led by quarterback Malcolm Perry\u2019s 386 yards and nine touchdowns on 82 carries. Fullback Nelson Smith has 249 yards and five TDs on 56 rushes.\n\nKICKING WOES\n\nTulsa\u2019s Jacob Rainey missed two field goals last week - a 44-yard attempt midway through the third quarter that would have given the Golden Hurricane a 33-9 advantage, and then a 43-yarder in the second overtime that would have won the game. Tulsa also had a 42-yard attempt in the third OT by their usual kickoff man, Zack Long, and he also missed it. Tulsa is 4-for-8 on field goal attempts this season.\n\nFRESH-BAKED TURNOVERS\n\nNavy struggled with turnovers in the Air Force game, fumbling the ball five times and losing it on three occasions, including twice after botched exchanges between Perry and center Ford Higgins. That was an unacceptable development for Niumatalolo.\n\n\u201cThose are things that we always stress, trying to be really good at turnover margin,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019ve been working on through camp, it\u2019s something we got to improve on. We can\u2019t have that happen.\u201d\n\n__\n\nMore AP college football: http://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tulsa and Navy are trying very hard not face another opponent in their game Saturday: An emotional hangover.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Tranchina"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/11/tulsa_smu_football_15661_c0-160-3836-2397_s1200x700.jpg?1fd5793090e49eb01ade3dfccfe4f9e8d317cb58", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
