Chung, who uses the handle \u201cBlitzchung,\u201d prompted the ban after saying \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\u201d during an interview about his tournament wins. Blizzard\u2019s actions forced him to forfeit $10,000 in prize money he had already won.\n\n\u201cThe action Blizzard took against the player was pretty appalling but not surprising,\u201d a longtime Blizzard employee told The Daily Beast. \u201cBlizzard makes a lot of money in China, but now the company is in this awkward position where we can\u2019t abide by our values.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed,\u201d another current Blizzard employee said. \u201cWe want people all over the world to play our games, but no action like this can be made with political neutrality.\u201d The employees spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of professional consequences.\n\nProtesting Blizzard employees from multiple departments gathered at an iconic statue of an Orc warrior charging into battle in the center of the company\u2019s main campus in Irvine, California, starting around 10 a.m. Pacific Time. The demonstration\u2019s numbers fluctuated throughout the day, the two employees said, ranging from a dozen to 30, and the protesters departed sometime in the late afternoon. The protesters would have been visible to executive offices, which overlook the main plaza, the two employees said. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Chinese tech giant Tencent owns a 5 percent stake in Blizzard, and the gaming company earned 12 percent of its revenue from the Asia-Pacific region last quarter, according to its earnings reports.\n\nThe decision prompted backlash from gamers and non-gamers alike, adding fuel to the fire begun by the National Basketball Association\u2019s own controversy over China and the Hong Kong protests.\n\nA person claiming to be a Blizzard employee and using the handle \u201cStandingwhk\u201d posted a picture to Reddit and Imgur that showed roughly 20 employees involved in the demonstration. Several employees held umbrellas, a visual symbol adopted by protesters in Hong Kong. Two current Blizzard employees authenticated the photo to The Daily Beast.\n\nBlizzard has placed plaques with its core company values along a circular compass around the orc. According to the two employees and photos, protesters had papered over one that read, \u201cEvery voice matters.\u201d\n\nThe protesters also solicited signatures for a petition expressing displeasure with Blizzard leadership\u2019s handling of the matter that they planned to submit to executives, the two employees said. Discussion about Blizzard\u2019s actions and of the protest, they said, continued Wednesday. The two employees said Blizzard executives have not taken any public action against the protesters.\n\nBlizzard\u2019s actions inspired a negative reaction among lawmakers, who denounced the gaming giant. On Twitter, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) said the company was willing to \u201chumiliate itself\u201d to please China. And Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) declared, \u201cImplications of this will be felt long after everyone in U.S. politics today is gone.\u201d", "description": "SOPA Images/GettyA small group of Activision Blizzard employees walked out of work Tuesday afternoon to protest the company\u2019s actions against a gamer who expressed support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong during an official livestream.The game publisher behind online multiplayer hits like World", "authors": ["Blake Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8lwLgsvyrKvu8JCCMg7RRA--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/04be398d58f18f167353aa7f2a0a4172", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
