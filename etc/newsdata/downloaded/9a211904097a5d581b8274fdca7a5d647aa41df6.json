He was sent home with medication and doctors said they didn't believe he had EEE\n\nHis family said he told them he wanted to go back to the emergency room earlier this month but, by the time paramedics he arrived, hew was unconscious. Pictured: Hess, right, with his late wife, Anne\n\n'He was very physically active, very physically fit, and just strong, so strong,' Carrie Hess told WOOD-TV.\n\n'And then he got [bitten] by a mosquito. And it took the strong man that we knew and loved and just destroyed his brain.'\n\nHess was an Army veteran who fought in the Korean War and then worked in construction until he retired.\n\nHe was very active and even dug a pond himself behind his home. The family believe that's where he may have been bitten by mosquitoes.\n\n'He hated bug spray,' Carrie Hess said. 'So even if we would've said: \"Dad, put on some bug spray,\" he wouldn't have listened to us.'\n\nHess's death marks the fifth fatality from EEE in Michigan out of nine confirmed cases.\n\nThere have additionally been four deaths in Massachusetts, three in Connecticut, one in Indiana and one in Rhode Island.\n\nEEE is a rare disease caused by a virus that is transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes.\n\nIt was first detected in Massachusetts in 1831 and typically affects about an equal number of horses and humans every year: roughly five to 10.\n\nThere is a vaccine for horses who contract the virus, but not humans.\n\nHis daughters said he never came out of his coma and, per his wishes, they took him off of life support.
