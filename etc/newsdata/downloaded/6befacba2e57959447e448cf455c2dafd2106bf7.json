Read the full story here.\n\nBOB WOODWARD: And the real first question is, where do you start the movie of your decision to run for president? Because that is a big deal. A lot of internal/external stuff, and we\u2019d love to hear your monologue on how you did it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDONALD TRUMP: Where do you start the movie? I think it\u2019s actually \u2014 and very interesting question \u2014 but I think the start was standing on top of the escalator at Trump Tower on June 16, which is the day \u2014 Bob, you were there, and you know what I mean, because there has. . . . I mean, it looked like the Academy Awards. I talk about it. There were so many cameras. So many \u2014 it was packed. The atrium of Trump Tower, which is a very big place, was packed. It literally looked like the Academy Awards. And . . . .\n\nBW: But we want to go before that moment.\n\nDT: Before that? Okay, because that was really . . . .\n\nBW: Because, other words, there\u2019s an internal Donald with Donald.\n\nAD\n\nROBERT COSTA: Maybe late 2014 or before you started hiring people?\n\nDT: Well, but that was \u2014 okay, but I will tell you, until the very end. . . . You know, I have a good life. I built a great company. It\u2019s been amazingly \u2014 I\u2019m sure you looked at the numbers. I have very little debt, tremendous assets. And great cash flows. I have a wonderful family. Ivanka just had a baby. Doing this is not the easiest thing in the world to do. People have \u2014 many of my friends, very successful people, have said, \"Why would you do this?\"\n\nAD\n\nBW: So is there a linchpin moment, Mr. Trump, where it went from maybe to yes, I\u2019m going to do this? And when was that?\n\nDT: Yeah. I would really say it was at the beginning of last year, like in January of last year. And there were a couple of times. One was, I was doing a lot of deals. I was looking at very seriously one time, not \u2014 they say, oh, he looked at it for many \u2014 I really, no. I made a speech at the end of the '80s in New Hampshire, but it was really a speech that was, it was not a political speech. But because it happened to be in New Hampshire . . . .\n\nAD\n\nBW: And that guy was trying to draft you.\n\nDT: And he was a very nice guy. But he asked me. And he was so intent, and I made a speech. It was not a political speech, anyway, and I forgot about it.\n\nBW: And that was the real possibility? Or the first . . . .\n\nAD\n\nDT: Well no, the real possibility was the Romney time, or the Romney term. This last one four years ago. I looked at that, really. I never looked at it seriously then. I was building my business, I was doing well. And I went up to New Hampshire, made a speech. And because it was in New Hampshire, it was sort of like, Trump is going to run. And since then people have said, Trump is going to run. I never was interested. I could almost say at all, gave it very little thought, other than the last time, where Romney was running. And I thought that Romney was a weak candidate. I thought that \u2014 I thought Obama was very beatable. Very, very beatable. You know, you had a president who was not doing well, to put it nicely. And I looked at that very seriously. I had some difficulty because I was doing some big jobs that were finishing up, which I wanted to do. My children were younger. And four years makes a big difference. And I also had a signed contract to do \"The Apprentice\" with NBC. Which in all fairness, you know, sounds like \u2014 when you\u2019re talking about \u201cpresident\u201d it doesn\u2019t sound much, but when you have a two-hour show, prime time, every once a week on a major network . . . .\n\nAD\n\nBW: So when did it go to yes?\n\nDT: So \u2014 okay.\n\nAD\n\nBW: Because that\u2019s \u2014 having made, you know, we all make minor decisions in our lives.\n\nDT: Okay.\n\nBW: This is the big one.\n\nDT: Big decision. Yeah, this is a big decision. And I say, sometimes I\u2019ll say it in the speeches. It takes guts to run for president, especially if you\u2019re not a politician, you\u2019ve never . . . .\n\nBW: When did it become yes?\n\nDT: What happened is, during that time that I was just talking about, I started saying I\u2019d like to do it, but I wasn\u2019t really in a position to do it. I was doing a lot of things, and I had a signed contract with NBC. But I started thinking about it. And the press started putting me in polls, and I was winning in the polls. In fact, the day before, I was on \"Meet the Press\" the day before I announced I wasn\u2019t going to do it, and I got signed for another two years of \"The Apprentice\" and everything else. Which, by the way, I don\u2019t know if you saw, but \"The Apprentice\" is a big thing. I made two hundred . . . .\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBW: You made a lot of money.\n\nDT: Yeah. You were shocked. Remember this crazy man, Lawrence O\u2019Donnell \u2014 he\u2019s a total crazy nut \u2014 he said, Donald Trump only made a million dollars with \"The Apprentice.\" I said, \"A million dollars?\" You know, when you have a show that\u2019s essentially number one almost every time it goes on, you can name it. . . . So anyway, when they added it all up \u2014 and these are certified numbers, because you have to do certified numbers \u2014 it came out to $213 million. Okay? That\u2019s what I made on \"The Apprentice.\" That\u2019s just \u2014 and that\u2019s one of my small things. That\u2019s what I made. You know? So it was put at $213 million, and it was certified. And your friend Joe in the morning said, \"There\u2019s no way he only made. . . .\" They had a big fight, and O\u2019Donnell, Lawrence O\u2019Donnell started crying. I never saw anything like it. Do you remember? He started crying. [Laughter] He actually started crying. But that shows the level of hatred that people have. But what happened is, I made \u2014 I had a very, very successful show. And they put me in polls, and I was essentially leading right at the top, without doing any work. Not one speech, not one anything. But any time I was in a poll, I did very well in the poll. Anyway, I decided not to do it. NBC called and Mark Burnett would call, and I did see if I could get out. I had another year on the contract. Because you\u2019re not allowed, because of the equal time, you\u2019re not allowed to have a show . . . .\n\nRC: What happened between 2011 and 2014?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDT: Well, that\u2019s what \u2014 I mean. . . . Between 2011 and 2014? I would say, just thought process. Only thought process.\n\nHOPE HICKS: A lot of deals.\n\nDT: Yeah, I mean, I was doing \u2014 but in terms of this, only thought process. So what happened, but during this period of time, I said, you know, this is something I really would like to do. I think I\u2019d do it really well. Obviously the public seems to like me, because without any . . . .\n\nBW: Who are you saying that to? Your wife?\n\nDT: To myself.\n\nBW: To your family?\n\nDT: To my family, but to myself.\n\nBW: To yourself.\n\nDT: Yeah, to myself, and . . . .\n\nBW: This is interior dialogue.\n\nDT: This is thought process. And I\u2019m saying to myself, you know, look, they put me in these polls. I\u2019m number one. In fact, I said, I\u2019m probably the only person ever to announce I\u2019m not going to run for president when I\u2019m number one in the polls. Because I remember the week that I announced that I wasn\u2019t going to run and that I was going to \u2014 that basically NBC extended me for quite a period of time. And the week . . . . Oh, this is my son Don. Bob and Bob.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDONALD TRUMP JR.: I know. At least I know one Bob. How are you?\n\n[Introductions]\n\nDT: So during \u2014 and I spoke to Don, I spoke to my children about it. But during this period of time, I said, you know, I think I could probably do very well if I did it. But I didn\u2019t do it because of contractual obligations, because I was finishing up things. Actually, this is one of the things right now. This started afterward. This started, we\u2019re actually a year and a half ahead of schedule and under budget on this hotel. So what happened, Bob, what happened is . . . . But during this period, I started really thinking during this period of time. And then Romney was a very, very failed and flawed candidate. He did a very poor job. Because I always felt that was a race that should\u2019ve been won. I think in many respects that\u2019s an easier race than the race you have now. And Romney did a poor job. And we all go back to work. Then about a year before June 16 \u2014 that\u2019s the day that I announced \u2014 I started really thinking about it very, very strongly. But the show continued to do very well. You know, 14 seasons, that\u2019s a long time. But it continued to do very well.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBW: Can you isolate a moment when it kicked to yes?\n\nDT: Well, I\u2019ll tell you a moment.\n\nBW: Because that\u2019s what Bob and I are looking for.\n\nDT: I\u2019ll tell you a moment when it kicked to yes. Because it was a monetary moment also. So you saw that it made a lot of money because it was certified. Now it\u2019s much more, because I also have a big chunk of the show. We chose Arnold Schwarzenegger to take my place. Okay? And hopefully Arnold will do well; who knows? But there was a moment in, I would say, February of last year, so that would be four months, three, four months before I announced, when Steve Burke, great guy, of Comcast \u2014 the head \u2014 came to see me with the top people at NBC. And they wanted to extend my contract. And I said, \"Steve, I think that I am going to run for president. And if I do that, I\u2019m not allowed to have a show.\" In fact, when I did \"Saturday Night Live\" recently, it was a whole big deal. I\u2019m not allowed to be on, and they actually had to give certain periods of time to other candidates that were running. It was a whole big . . . . So. I disagree with the equal time provisions. I think they\u2019re very unfair. But nevertheless, you have them. So I said, \"Steve, I can\u2019t have a show if I run. I can\u2019t be having a show, so I\u2019m not going to run.\" He says, \"No, no, no, you\u2019re going to do it.\" I said, \"Steve, I\u2019m going to.\" And they actually went to the upfronts and they announced that \"The Apprentice\" \u2014 in fact, you had a problem with it, because you were hearing that I was going to run, and then they announce that they\u2019re going to renew \"The Apprentice\" with Donald Trump. And I remember he called one of my people, maybe Hope. But he called one of my people and said, \"Wait a minute, he\u2019s going to run, but he just announced he\u2019s doing 'The Apprentice.' \" Do you remember that problem?\n\nRC: Sure. I remember.\n\nDT: I didn\u2019t announce it. It was NBC, they so wanted the show to be renewed.\n\nRC: But what we've never fully understood is about . . . . Before that meeting with Burke, I've just never heard you talk about it in a vivid way. What was going through your mind about the country? With this moment in your life? That you said to yourself, \"I\u2019m going to tell Burke I\u2019m going to run for president.\"\n\nDT: Well, okay. Sure. Okay. Prior to that, I just felt there were so many things going wrong with the country. In particular, because I\u2019m a very natural person when it comes to business, I assume \u2014 I mean, I\u2019ve done really well, and I do have an instinct for that \u2014 and I felt that we were doing some of the worst trade deals ever. And then you look at what\u2019s going on in Iran with the beginning of negotiations of that disastrous deal. You know, look, it could\u2019ve been a much better deal, Bob. They could\u2019ve walked a couple of times. They could\u2019ve doubled the sanctions for a couple of days and gotten the prisoners out early. They could\u2019ve done so many things. To give the $150 billion back was terrible. So it was a terrible deal. It was a terrible negotiation. It was negotiated by people that are poor negotiators against great negotiators. Persians being great negotiators, okay? It\u2019s one of those things. You might be Persian. But the Iranians, frankly, are great negotiators. The deal was a disaster. But I would see so many things. And it would make me angry.\n\nBW: What made you angriest?\n\nDT: I would say in my case, more than anything else, the stupidity of the trade deals that we have with China, with Japan, with Mexico, with other . . . . Because that\u2019s something that I see. And I didn\u2019t know that it would hit such a chord, because it\u2019s hit a chord with a lot of . . . .\n\nBW: So when did you tell somebody in your family or your circle, \"I\u2019ve decided to run.\" Other words, I\u2019ve pulled the switch.\n\nDT: Well, I would tell my family about it all the time. Don is one of my sons, and doing a really good job. He\u2019s involved very much in this job. . . . Don and my family, I would talk about it a lot. I would say, \"I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re doing it.\" And another thing would happen. I own a big part of the Bank of America building in San Francisco [and] 1290 Avenue of the Americas. I got it from China. Meaning Chinese people had it. It was a big thing. It was a war, it was actually a war.\n\nBW: Did anyone recommend no? Did your wife, or did your son?\n\nDT: Oh. Yeah.\n\nBW: Did anyone say, \"Dad, Donald, don\u2019t do it?\"\n\nDT: I think my wife would much have preferred that I didn\u2019t do it. She\u2019s a very private person. She was a very, very successful \u2014 very, very successful model. She made a tremendous amount of money and had great success and dealt at the . . . .\n\nBW: What\u2019d she say?\n\nDT: She was, she said, we have such a great life. \"Why do you want to do this?\" She was . . . .\n\nBW: And what\u2019d you say?\n\nDT: I said, \"I sort of have to do it, I think. I really have to do it.\" Because it\u2019s something I\u2019d be \u2014 I could do such a great job. I really wanted to give something back. I don\u2019t want to act overly generous, but I really wanted to give something back.\n\nBW: Well, that\u2019s the important moment, when you say, I have to do it.\n\nDT: Yeah, I had to.\n\nBW: That\u2019s the product of the endless internal dialogue.\n\nDT: Well, she\u2019s a very private person, and very smart person. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen a couple of interviews that she\u2019s done. She\u2019s very smart. And there\u2019s no games. You know, it\u2019s boom, it\u2019s all business. But a very smart person. And considered one of the great beauties.\n\nBW: Did she give you the green light?\n\nDT: And she said, \"Why are we doing the . . . .\" Oh, absolutely. She said, \"If you want to do it, then you should do it, but . . . .\" And she actually said something that was very interesting. She\u2019s very observant. And she would go around with me. And look, I\u2019ve been around for a long time at a high level. That\u2019s why you were up in my office in, I guess it was \u201989, I can\u2019t believe. So that might help you with your check. Check \u201989, \u201988. But I\u2019ve been around a long time. She said, \"You know if you run, you\u2019ll win.\" I said, \"I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to win.\" She said, \"If you run, you\u2019ll win. But if you say you\u2019re going to run, they\u2019re never going to \u2013 people are not going to believe it.\" Because people were let down the first time, I will tell you. They really wanted me to run, and I would\u2019ve beaten Romney. They really \u2014 they wanted me to run that time. So for the most part, the polls didn\u2019t include me. And then one poll included me, and I didn\u2019t do that well. I was down at like 3 percent. I said to my wife, \"I don\u2019t think I can run. I\u2019m down at 3 percent.\" Boy, that\u2019s a long way to go up. And she goes, \"No, no, no, you\u2019re only at 3 percent because they don\u2019t believe you\u2019re running. If they thought you were going to run . . . .\" I said,\"No, no, the poll said I\u2019m going to run.\" She said, \"No, no, they still don\u2019t believe it.\" It doesn\u2019t matter what the poll says. The poll can say, you are going to run, Donald Trump is going to absolutely run. It was very interesting. Sort of like \u2014 I called her my pollster. She said, \"No, no, they won\u2019t believe that. I don\u2019t care if they put it in, if they put it at the top of your building, 'I\u2019m going to run.' They\u2019re not going to believe it unless that you go out and announce that you\u2019re going to run.\" And she said, \"I hope you don\u2019t do it, but if you run, you\u2019ll win.\"\n\nRC: So it was an evolution. Let\u2019s turn to ...\n\nDT: So it was an evolution.\n\nWOODWARD: Yeah.\n\nRC: Let\u2019s turn to the presidency. You\u2019re nearing the nomination . . . .\n\nDT: And then the big thing, by the way, the big thing was standing at the top of that escalator, looking down into that room \u2014 which was a sea of reporters, of which he was one, but a sea \u2014 that was as big as anything we\u2019ve had. And getting up and saying, all right. And I remember. I took a deep breath. I said, \"Let\u2019s go,\" to my wife. And you know, we came down. Pretty famous scene, the escalator scene. Boom. And we started, and we talked illegal immigration, and it became a very big subject, and that\u2019s where we started.\n\nRC: As you near the nomination and you look ahead to the possibility of being president of the United States, how do you conceptualize presidential power? And how do you see the job of president? This is something that\u2019s nearing, right now, for you.\n\nDT: Okay. So first of all, I have to get there. Because I view it as a highly competitive process. I\u2019ve been, it\u2019s very interesting, I\u2019ve done very well up until now. I\u2019ve taken out a lot of people. We had 17 people.\n\nRC: Let\u2019s say you\u2019re the president, though. How do you see the office of the presidency?\n\nBW: Other words, what\u2019s the definition of the job?\n\nDT: Okay. I think more than anything else, it\u2019s the security of our nation. That\u2019s always going to be \u2013 that\u2019s number one, two and three. After that, many things come into focus. It\u2019s health, it\u2019s health care. It\u2019s jobs. It\u2019s the economy. But number one \u2014and I say number one, two, three \u2014 is the security of the country. The military, being strong, not letting bad things happen to our country from the outside. And I certainly think that that\u2019s always going to be my number one part of that definition.\n\nBW: Any . . . . Before coming over, Bob and I have had lots of chats. And we were thinking about this, that you are running for the nomination in the Republican Party.\n\nDT: Right.\n\nBW: Which is the party of Lincoln and the party of Nixon. . . . And so we have this party that you are running to be the nominee in, and it\u2019s got two heritages. Lincoln and Nixon.\n\nDT: That\u2019s true. That\u2019s true.\n\nBW: And why did Lincoln succeed? Thought about that at all?\n\nDT: Well, I think Lincoln succeeded for numerous reasons. He was a man who was of great intelligence, which most presidents would be. But he was a man of great intelligence, but he was also a man that did something that was a very vital thing to do at that time. Ten years before or 20 years before, what he was doing would never have even been thought possible. So he did something that was a very important thing to do, and especially at that time. And Nixon failed, I think to a certain extent, because of his personality. You know? It was just that personality. Very severe, very exclusive. In other words, people couldn\u2019t come in. And people didn\u2019t like him. I mean, people didn\u2019t like him.\n\nBW: And he broke the law.\n\nDT: And he broke the law, yeah. Yeah. He broke the law. Whether that\u2019s insecurity . . . .\n\nBW: I mean, you listen to those tapes, and he\u2019s a criminal.\n\nDT: Yeah. Whether that\u2019s \u2014 right. And he broke the law.\n\nBW: And time and time again, break in, get the FBI on this, get the IRS on.\n\nDT: Sure. Sure.\n\nBW: I mean, it is an appalling legacy of criminality.\n\nDT: Right.\n\nBW: And at the end, the day he resigned, an amazing day, he gives that speech which is kind of free association about mom and dad.\n\nDT: Right.\n\nBW: He\u2019s sweating. And then he said, \u201cAlways remember: Others may hate you, but those who hate you don\u2019t win unless you hate them, and then you destroy yourself.\u201d The piston was hate.\n\nDT: Well, and he was actually talking very much about himself, because ultimately, ultimately, that is what destroyed him. Hate is what destroyed him. And such an interesting figure. I mean, you would know that better than anybody. But such an interesting figure. And such a man of great talent. I mean, Nixon had great potential, great talent. Unfortunately it was a very sad legacy in the end. It turned out to be a very sad legacy. Such an interesting figure to study. I think. . . .\n\nBW: Do you take any lessons from that? Because what did is he converted the presidency to an instrument of personal revenge.\n\nDT: Yeah.\n\nBW: You\u2019re my enemy, I\u2019m going to get you. I\u2019m going to get so-and-so on you.\n\nDT: Yeah. No, I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t see that. What I do see is \u2014 what I am amazed at is, I\u2019m somebody that gets along with people. And sometimes I\u2019ll notice, I\u2019ll be, I have the biggest crowds. Actually we\u2019ve purposefully kept the crowds down this past week. You know, we\u2019ve gone into small venues and we\u2019re turning away thousands and thousands of people, which I hate, but we didn\u2019t want to have the protest. You know, when you have a room of 2,000 people, you can pretty much keep it without the protesters. When you have 21 or 25,000 people coming in, people can start standing up and screaming. What has been amazing to me \u2014 I\u2019m a very inclusive person. I actually am somebody that gets along with people. And yet from a political standpoint, although I certainly have a lot of fans \u2014 you just said hello to Senator Sessions. Cruz and everybody wanted Senator Sessions as much as they\u2019ve wanted anybody, and he\u2019s a highly respected guy, great guy. And we have some\u2014 and he endorsed me. We have some amazing endorsements, some amazing people, but I\u2019m amazed at the level of animosity toward me by some people. I\u2019m amazed.\n\nRC: But you\u2019re going to have to overcome that, Mr. Trump, if you\u2019re going to be the nominee and the president.\n\nDT: I think you may be right. I think you may be right.\n\nRC: I think this is such a pivot moment for you.\n\nDT: Okay.\n\nRC: You\u2019re nearing the nomination. The presidency is possible. How do you \u2013 you say you get along with all these people. How do you . . . .\n\nDT: No, I say in my life I\u2019ve gotten along with people.\n\nRC: Understood.\n\nDT: This is the first time where I\u2019ve had this.\n\nRC: How do you expand your reach right now? How are you going to do this at this moment in the country, where there\u2019s all this anger that you\u2019re talking about? You think there\u2019s a lot of animus toward yourself. How do you expand your reach, your appeal, right now?\n\nDT: Well, let me tell you the biggest problem that I have. And I talk about it a lot. I get a very unfair press. I\u2019m somebody that\u2019s a person that understands when I say \u2014 when I say, I say what I say. But I really do get a very, very unfair press. And a lot of times I\u2019ll be making a speech, as an example, in front of a \u2014 in Orlando, where you have 20, 25,000 people show up in the sun at 3 in the afternoon in an open venue. And I will be saying things, and Bob, it won\u2019t be reported what I say. It will be reported so differently.\n\nRC: So how do you \u2014 so regardless of your view of the press, how do you navigate the . . . .\n\nDT: Well, the problem with my view of the . . . .\n\nRC: The candidate has to get beyond all these different obstacles.\n\nDT: No, you\u2019re right, but if the press would report what I say, I think I would go a long way to doing that. Now, there is a natural bias against me because I\u2019m a businessperson, I\u2019m not in the club. Okay? You understand that. I\u2019m not in the club. I\u2019m not a senator, I\u2019m not a politician. I\u2019m not somebody that\u2019s been in Congress for 25 years, and I know everybody, I\u2019m somebody \u2014 I\u2019m very much an outsider. I am also somebody that\u2019s self-funding my campaign, other than small contributions.\n\nBW: But the press likes outsiders. I mean . . . .\n\nDT: But the press doesn\u2019t like me. For the most part.\n\nBW: And would you blame the problem on the press, on the media coverage?\n\nDT: No, I, but I think . . . I do say this: My media coverage is not honest. It really isn\u2019t. And I\u2019m not saying that as a person with some kind of a complex. I\u2019m just saying, I will be saying words that are written totally differently from what I\u2019ve said. And I see it all \u2014 in all fairness, the editorial board of The Washington Post. I was killed on that. I left the room, I thought it was fine.\n\nRC: But what are some concrete steps you could take right now to project a bigger presence, a more unifying presence? Regardless of your view of the press, which is noted. How do you take steps now to really become a nominee?\n\nDT: Well, I think \u2014 it\u2019s a great question, and it\u2019s a question I\u2019ve thought about a lot. I mean, I think the first thing I have to do is win. Winning solves a lot of problems. And I have two people left. We started off with 17 people. I have two people left. And one of the problems I have is that when I hit people, I hit them harder maybe than is necessary. And it\u2019s almost impossible to reel them back. . . . So [a famous athlete] calls me up about a month ago, right after I beat Rubio. And I beat him by 20 points. That was a big beating. Don\u2019t forget, he was the face of the Republican Party. He was the future of the Republican Party. So [he] called me up. And he said, \u201cHey Donald, could you do us all a favor? We love you. Don\u2019t kill everybody. Because you may need them on the way back.\u201d You know, you may need them when you go to phase 3, or whatever phase you\u2019re looking . . . .\n\nBW: Because here\u2019s what \u2014 what Bob Costa and I were talking about, and we appreciate this moment to really get into these things.\n\nDT: I just thought it was a great . . . . You know, especially . . . .\n\nBW: No, no, exactly. Having done this, reporting, so many years \u2014 too many decades \u2014 that I\u2019ve thought about, what\u2019s politics? All politics, all successful politics, is about coalition building.\n\nDT: It\u2019s true.\n\nBW: Do you agree?\n\nDT: I do. I agree. I agree.\n\nBW: And if you look . . . .\n\nDT: But I think you have to break the egg initially. In other words, I agree with you, but when you\u2019re coming from where I\u2019m coming from \u2014 I came from the outside. By the way, I was establishment. I was an establishment guy until I said I\u2019m running. And then when I said I don\u2019t want anyone\u2019s money, that drove everyone . . . . I mean, outside of the small contributions, you know, the stuff. . . . But \u2014 because \u2014 and even \u2014 the reason for the small \u2014 we get lots of little contributions. What does it amount to? Six, 7 million dollars? And we sell paraphernalia, we sell the Trump shirt and the Trump hat, little stuff. But it still amounted to like 6 million dollars, seven. But I\u2019m in for about $35 million. But I don\u2019t want any money. Bob, I have turned down \u2014 I would have made \u2014 Bush had $148 million. I would\u2019ve had five times that much if I wanted to take it.\n\nBW: But you said it: Sometimes you have to break an egg.\n\nDT: Sometimes you have to break an egg.\n\nBW: And haven\u2019t you broken enough eggs?\n\nDT: Well, if that\u2019s the question, I think I have two more left.\n\nBW: And . . . . Okay, but at this point of \u2014 as you \u2014 Bob Costa, from his perspective of knowing the Republican Party . . . and the question is, how do you coalition-build, how do you unbreak those eggs?\n\nDT: So that\u2019s the question.\n\nRC: I was struck by your comments about Senator Cruz. It seems like you\u2019re not working as much as I would\u2019ve thought to bring the party together.\n\nDT: I\u2019m looking to win first. I really believe that once . . . . My life has been about victories. I\u2019ve won a lot. I win a lot. I win \u2014when I do something, I win. And even in sports, I always won. I was always a good athlete. And I always won. In golf, I\u2019ve won many club championships. Many, many club championships. And I have people that can play golf great, but they can\u2019t win under pressure. So I\u2019ve always won.\n\nBW: But Bob\u2019s question is right at the heart of this. Because you said about Senator Cruz, I don\u2019t want his support.\n\nDT: Oh, is that what you\u2019re referring to?\n\nBW: Yeah. And he is, whatever you may think of him, and whatever battles you\u2019ve had, he represents the Reagan conservative . . . .\n\nDT: No, I don\u2019t think he represents Reagan.\n\nRC: Some people think he does.\n\nBW: That\u2019s how he\u2019s selling himself.\n\nDT: Okay. Well, maybe now how he\u2019s selling himself.\n\nBW: That\u2019s perceived. And if you\u2019re going to be the nominee, you need the conservatives in the party.\n\nDT: Yeah. Well, but I also need the outside people, and I\u2019m definitely now the outsider. Cruz is interesting. We got along very well.\n\nBW: Initially?\n\nDT: I would make provocative statements, and he would say, \"I agree with Mr. Trump.\" I mean, he was above all. But I kept saying, \"I wonder when he will attack.\" Because ultimately, assuming . . . . Because I\u2019ve been at the center of the dais from day one. And even the other day, NBC came out with a poll, I\u2019m at 48 to twenty-something. You know, that\u2019s a national poll. So what happened is he was, could not have been more supportive. And in fact, he made a speech, he was making a big speech in Washington, and he didn\u2019t have that many people going. And he called me and he said, \"Would it be possible for you to come?\" I made it outside of the capital, right in front of the capital, and I came and a tremendous number of people came and it was very successful. We shook hands and I left and that was that. But I got along with Cruz, Cruz, great. But I always said, Bob, and you were there, I said, at some point, this is going to end. Because people would say, you\u2019re the only two.\n\nRC: Right. And at some point the nomination battle ends.\n\nDT: Yeah. And at some point the nomination.\n\nRC: Maybe I\u2019m mishearing you, but I feel like you\u2019re almost comfortable being the Lone Ranger.\n\nDT: I am. Because I understand life. And I understand how life works. I\u2019m the Lone Ranger. And I said the other day \u2014 I watched Cruz as he tried to be as politically correct as he could be. And they say, well, will you support? And I watched him during the debate, and he said yes, and Rubio said yes, and everybody said yes. Because that was the thing to do. We have to support the party. But I watched him struggling the other day, struggling so hard, to not use the word \u201cno\u201d when asked about will he support Donald Trump. At the same time, not wanting to \u2014 wishing the question wasn\u2019t asked. Because he didn\u2019t want to do anything that would be offensive to the party, let\u2019s say, and to standard politics.\n\nBW: Can I just say for . . . .\n\nDT: But Bob, what I told him...\n\nBW: Yes sir.\n\nDT: What I said is that, I watched that, and I said, look, he doesn\u2019t have to support me. It really doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t want to make his life difficult.\n\nBW: But can you be president and be Lone Ranger?\n\nDT: Um . . . .\n\nBW: I mean, as we were talking about Lincoln \u2013 if we may.\n\nDT: Yeah.\n\nBW: Lincoln\u2019s second inaugural, he\u2019s won the war, he has broken more eggs than any president ever.\n\nDT: He broke a lot of eggs.\n\nBW: And he comes out and in his second inaugural he said, \u201cMalice toward none, charity for all, bind up the nation\u2019s wounds.\u201d\n\nDT: Right.\n\nBW: Other words, he\u2019s saying, let\u2019s go back and coalition-build between the North and the South. Isn\u2019t that a moment you\u2019re going to have to face?\n\nDT: Totally, totally.\n\nBW: Or is that not right now, this moment?\n\nDT: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s now.\n\nBW: You don\u2019t?\n\nDT: No, because I think I have to win before I can do that. Look, I\u2019ve had...\n\nBW: Might that not assist in the winning?\n\nDT: No, because you have two people that want to win also, and they\u2019re not going to be changing their ways.\n\nRC: What does it look like, though, when you pivot to the general election? Let\u2019s say you win the nomination. How does that coalition-building, that unity message \u2013 what does that look like? How is Trump the unifier different than Trump the primary battler?\n\nDT: Okay. As you know, certain polls have me beating Hillary Clinton, but I haven\u2019t focused on Hillary Clinton yet. Okay? And I say that all the time. I have not focused on her. I\u2019ve only focused on the people that are ahead of me, and right now I have two people. I don\u2019t have to think about whether it\u2019s going to be Hillary or somebody else. I\u2019d love your view on what\u2019s going to happen with Hillary from the other standpoint, okay? Because that\u2019s really going to be a very interesting question. And it seems to be heating up, which is almost a little surprising, because it looked to me like she\u2019s being protected. But my family said to me \u2013 and Don has said this, and Ivanka, and my wife has said this \u2013 \"Be more presidential.\" Because I can be very presidential. I jokingly say, I can be more presidential than any president that this country has ever had except for Abraham Lincoln, because he was [unclear]. Right? You can\u2019t out-top Abraham Lincoln.\n\nBW: Isn\u2019t that what people want to see now?\n\nDT: Yeah. Yeah, but they said... Yes.\n\nBW: In the Republican Party, I mean . . . there is a lot of angst and rage and distress.\n\nDT: A lot. Record-setting.\n\nBW: Record-setting.\n\nDT: I bring...\n\nBW: And you have to tame that rage, don\u2019t you?\n\nDT: Yes, yes, but I bring that out in people. I do. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s an asset or a liability, but I do bring that out.\n\nBW: You bring what out?\n\nDT: I bring rage out. I do bring rage out. I always have. I think it was . . . . I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s an asset or a liability, but whatever it is, I do. I also bring great unity out, ultimately. I\u2019ve had many occasions like this, where people have hated me more than any human being they\u2019ve ever met. And after it\u2019s all over, they end up being my friends. And I see that happening here. But when my wife and Ivanka and the rest of my family, for the most part \u2014 Tiffany, my daughter, she\u2019s a very smart young woman, she\u2019s up at University of Pennsylvania doing great \u2014 and she said to me the same thing.\n\nBW: Be presidential?\n\nDT: Be presidential. Now . . . .\n\nBW: When did they start saying this to you?\n\nDT: Well, they really started saying it before the last debate. The last debate. And if you noticed, my attitude was much different in the last debate, okay? But I said, wait a minute. According to every single \u2014 you know, Drudge, and all of the polls, they do these online \u2013 they have polls for everything. They do debate polls. And you know what I\u2019m talking about.\n\nRC: Sure.\n\nDT: Hundreds of thousands of people vote. I won every single debate. Every single debate. And I was rough and I was nasty. And I was treated nastily by the other side too. And then Rubio went, you know, Rubio went Don Rickles on me, and all of a sudden he became cute and he started getting extremely nasty. And I had to get even nastier to him. Now, what happened \u2014and then started with the Little Marco. Come on, Little Marco. Little Marco over here said this and that. And he didn\u2019t want to \u2014 he didn\u2019t stop that, he didn\u2019t stop that because he was told, oh, he should stop. He stopped that because I was outdoing him. But here\u2019s the thing.\n\nBW: We understand the history of this. We followed.\n\nDT: Right, but here\u2019s the thing.\n\nRC: So is it . . . .\n\nDT: Wait.\n\nRC: Sure.\n\nDT: Okay, so my family comes up. Don. My daughter Tiffany, who\u2019s a great kid. Ivanka. My wife. And we were together. They said, \"Be presidential, Dad, be presidential.\" Last debate. I said, wait a minute. If I get hit, I\u2019m going to hit back. That\u2019s not going to look very presidential, because I hit back and you hit back. I said, I\u2019m going to give it a shot. And I was actually \u2014 you know, the last debate was actually a much different debate . . . .\n\nRCO: Right.\n\nDT: In terms of my tone. And I actually got my highest ratings on that debate.\n\nRC: But I\u2019m just struck by \u2014 we\u2019re asking the questions about being presidential. So many other people have asked, can Trump pivot, can he shift to a different kind of tone? And correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but my view, listening to you, is you actually don\u2019t really have that much interest in changing too much.\n\nDT: Not yet. Not yet.\n\nRC: But it seems your natural inclination is to fight . . . .\n\nDT: No.\n\nRC: No?\n\nDT: My \u2014 yes, always to fight. My natural inclination is to win. And after I win, I will be so presidential that you won\u2019t even recognize me. You\u2019ll be falling asleep, you\u2019ll be so bored.\n\nBW: Really. But when Ted Cruz said what he said, and then you said, I don\u2019t need his support.\n\nDT: I don\u2019t need his support. I don\u2019t believe I need it.\n\nBW: Now, what would your family say to you?\n\nDT: Well, what I said is, I don\u2019t need his . . . .\n\nBW: What would a president say? What would Reagan say? What would Lincoln say if the opposition came and said whatever they said, and then you said . . . .\n\nDT: Well Bob . . . .\n\nBW: Hey, look, we are going to bind up . . . .\n\nDT: Yeah.\n\nBW: Not the nation\u2019s wounds at this point, the party\u2019s . . . .\n\nRC: You think maybe you do need Cruz\u2019s support? Maybe you do need it at some point.\n\nDT: I don\u2019t think \u2014 I have the people\u2019s support. I have a tremendous group. And by the way, let me just, before we get off that one \u2014 because you were saying about Cruz \u2014 it wasn\u2019t like he embraced me.\n\nBW: No, he didn\u2019t.\n\nDT: It wasn\u2019t like he said, oh, I will endorse Donald Trump. He is so wonderful, and if I don\u2019t make it he is somebody that I think would be fantastic. Well, he didn\u2019t exactly say that, Bob. He said . . . . He was pained having to answer the question.\n\nBW: Right.\n\nDT: So it wasn\u2019t like I\u2019m saying, I don\u2019t want his support, as he says great things about me. So I had no guilt whatsoever saying it. I do believe it.\n\nBW: Do you think you\u2019re going to be at a point where you\u2019re going to have to call him and say, \"Ted, I need you?\"\n\nDT: I\u2019ll never have to call him. I may be at a point where I call him, but I never will . . . .\n\nBW: And what would you say? If you won the nomination, would you call him and say . . . .\n\nDT: I would call him to say congratulations on a great job. Because out of 17 people, you beat 16. Okay? Which is pretty good, to put it mildly. You know, we had a lot of talent. When I first ran, and this is where I had some doubts, because what do I know? I didn\u2019t know most of these people. Although I\u2019d been very political. I\u2019d given a lot of money. I gave $350,000 last year to the Republican Governors Association. I was a member of the establishment, if you think about it, and very high standing because of . . . .\n\nBW: Could you say to Ted Cruz, \"Ted, the coalition-building is going to begin right now. I need your support and help and advice?\"\n\nDT: I don\u2019t think I\u2019d say it that way, but I would be able . . . .\n\nBW: How would you say it?\n\nDT: . . . to get along with some of the people that I was competing against. Now, I will say this: Some of the people that I was competing against, I\u2019m not sure they can ever go back to me. I was very rough on Jeb. I was told when I first started that Jeb was the preemptive favorite. He was going to . . . .\n\nRC: Right. But you don\u2019t have a strategy for these \"Never Trump\" people? You would think if you\u2019re the nominee, you would have to find a way to bring Bush into the fold, to bring a Rubio into the fold.\n\nDT: I don\u2019t think \u2014 look . . . .\n\nRC: Do you have a strategy for that at all?\n\nDT: I think that\u2019s overrated, what you\u2019re saying, about bringing them into the fold. At the same time, I think I would be successful with many of them. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll be successful with Jeb Bush.\n\nRC: Right.\n\nBW: How about Cruz? What would you say to him, Donald?\n\nDT: I think I would . . . .\n\nBW: Because this is really \u2014 I think this . . . .\n\nDT: Yeah, I understand.\n\nBW: We get pivot points, and we\u2019re going from a phase of . . . .\n\nDT: I think Cruz and I could get along very well. I actually think so. We got along very well for six months.\n\nBW: Would you say, \"I need your support?\"\n\nDT: We got along very well for six months when I was attacking everybody.\n\nBW: Right. But now you\u2019re going to have to reach out to him, aren\u2019t you, if this is going to work?\n\nDT: Well, we\u2019ll have to see what happens. I don\u2019t think now, Bob, because he wants to win and I want to win. And I guess Kasich wants to win, although Kasich\u2019s only won one out of 28, right? That\u2019s not so good.\n\nRC: Our big picture is how Reagan in 1980 competed against George H. W. Bush in the primary, then put him on the ticket.\n\nDT: Yeah, and got along. And truly disliked each other.\n\nRC: And put him on the ticket.\n\nDT: Yeah.\n\nRC: Considers him to be part of the team, team of rivals. Could you have a team of rivals in a general election?\n\nDT: I would never want to say that now. Right now, I just want to win. And I don\u2019t want to say who\u2019s going to be \u2014 as an example, people are saying, you should pick so-and-so as vice president. It\u2019s just too early for that. In my opinion, it\u2019s too . . . .\n\nRC: You have a few names on your mind about VP?\n\nDT: I do. I do have names.\n\nRC: Can you share one or two?\n\nDT: I\u2019d rather not do it now.\n\nRC: One or two?\n\nCOREY LEWANDOWSKI: But Dr. Carson\u2019s come to the campaign, and Chris Christie\u2019s come to the campaign, and they were rivals in the past. And they said there was one person who we believe is going to make the country great again.\n\nDT: Very good point.\n\nCL: And look, nobody hit Dr. Carson harder than Mr. Trump did. It was very fair, and he made a very impressive speech in Iowa.\n\nDT: The only thing I did with Dr. Carson \u2014 because I respect him a lot \u2014 but I just talked about his book. Because he wrote things in his book, and all I did was quote from his book. Because, you know, it was tough stuff what he wrote about himself. He wrote about himself. It\u2019s an amazing story. And he . . . .\n\nBW: Without names . . . .\n\nDT: . . . understands that.\n\nBW: . . . as vice president, what would be the role and responsibilities of your vice president, should you be elected, should you win the nomination?\n\nDT: Well, the number one role is to be a great president if something should happen. Okay? That\u2019s always got to be the number one role for a vice president. After that, I would say, frankly, somebody that can help you get elected. And then thirdly, somebody that helps you with the Senate and with the House. So it would be a political person. In other words, I don\u2019t need to have another great businessman come in and \u2014 I don\u2019t need that. What I do . . . .\n\nBW: Somebody who knows dreaded Washington, perhaps.\n\nDT: Somebody that can walk into the Senate and who\u2019s been friendly with these guys for 25 years, and people for 25 years. And can get things done. So I would 95 percent see myself picking a political person as opposed to somebody from the outside.\n\nBW: And would that person be integral to the governing team you would have in the White House? Go to all meetings, have total access?\n\nDT: Yes, I would. . . . Sure. Sure. This would be a vice president \u2014 I would like to have somebody. . . . For instance, somebody like Ben Carson. When Ben Carson came to me \u2014 not necessarily vice president \u2014 but when he came to me, he called, he said, \"What you\u2019re doing is amazing. It\u2019s a movement. And you see that.\" When I announce I\u2019m going to go to Tampa three days before, and we go there three days later, there\u2019s 25,000 people in the stadium that houses the professional sports teams . . . .\n\nRC: No, it says a lot that \u2014 you are acknowledging that you don\u2019t want to have another outsider as part of your team.\n\nDT: Yeah.\n\nRC: You need an insider.\n\nDT: Somebody like Ben Carson, he never once said to me, could I have a position?\n\nRC: He doesn\u2019t fit that model.\n\nDT: No, no, he doesn\u2019t. But he will be absolutely somebody that I\u2019d love to have involved with us at a high level, at a very high level. Chris Christie. Chris called, he said, I\u2019d love to be involved. And I said, that\u2019s great. I\u2019ve never been a big one for endorsements. Although Tom Brady loves me in New England; I think that\u2019s why I got 50 percent. Okay? Tom Brady loves me. [Laughter] That helped.\n\nRC: So, sticking on this presidency theme for a second, I don\u2019t think a lot of people know that much about how much you value discretion, loyalty within your business.\n\nDT: Great loyalty, yes. Great discretion, great loyalty.\n\nRC: But it\u2019s different when you\u2019re running the federal government.\n\nDT: Well, it\u2019s . . . .\n\nRC: And one thing I always wondered, are you going to make employees of the federal government sign nondisclosure agreements?\n\nDT: I think they should. You know, when somebody \u2014 and I see it all the time. . . . And I don\u2019t know, there could be some kind of a law that you can\u2019t do this. But when people are chosen by a man to go into government at high levels and then they leave government and they write a book about a man and say a lot of things that were really guarded and personal, I don\u2019t like that. I mean, I\u2019ll be honest. And people would say, oh, that\u2019s terrible, you\u2019re taking away his right to free speech. Well, he\u2019s going in. . . . I would say . . . I do have nondisclosure deals. That\u2019s why you don\u2019t read that. . . .\n\nBW: With everyone? Corey has one, Hope has one.\n\nDT: Corey has one, Hope has one. Did you sign one?\n\nHH: Of course.\n\nCL: Stephen [Miller, Trump's policy adviser] has one.\n\nDT: Stephen has one.\n\nCL: [Donald Trump, Jr.] has one.\n\nDTJ.: I don\u2019t have one. I\u2019m in the middle of the book. [Laughter]\n\nCL: Don has two. [Laughter]\n\nDT: I know, I forgot, he\u2019s the one I\u2019m most worried about.\n\nDTJ: I\u2019m not getting next week\u2019s paycheck until I sign one.\n\nDT: I have a very, very, very prominent businessman who\u2019s right now got a person \u2014 he\u2019s involved in litigation, terrible litigation with somebody that worked for him in a very close level. And I said why are you . . . .\n\nBW: Do you think these are airtight agreements?\n\nDT: Yeah, totally. I think they\u2019re very airtight. They\u2019re very . . . .\n\nBW: And that no one could write a book or . . . .\n\nDT: I think they\u2019re extremely airtight. And anybody that violated it \u2014 let\u2019s put it this way: it\u2019s so airtight that I\u2019ve never had . . . you know, I\u2019ve never had a problem with this sort of thing.\n\nBW: Let us ask this . . . .\n\nDT: By the way, this man called me, he said, how is it that you don\u2019t have \u2014 as famous as you are? And I sent him a copy of the agreement. He said, this is genius. And he now has people that go to work for him. I don\u2019t like people that take your money and then say bad things about you. Okay? You know, they take your . . . .\n\nRC: But it\u2019s so different when you\u2019re in the federal government.\n\nDT: It\u2019s different, I agree. It\u2019s different.\n\nRC: But you are recommending nondisclosure...\n\nDT: And I tell you this, I will have to think about it. I will have to think about it. That\u2019s a different thing, that I\u2019m running a private company and I\u2019m paying people lots of money, and then they go out and...\n\nBW: The taxpayers are paying the other people in the federal government.\n\nDT: Sure. Sure. They don\u2019t do a great job, and then you fire them and they end up writing a book about you. So it\u2019s different. But I will say that in the federal government it\u2019s a different thing. So it\u2019s something I would think about. But you know, I do right now \u2014 I have thousands and thousands of employees, many thousands, and every one of them has an agreement, has a . . . I call it a confidentiality . . . .\n\nBW: Say you\u2019re elected president. Would one four-year term be enough?\n\nDT: I would say the following: I have seen people make the statement for Senate and for other positions, government \u2014 because I\u2019ve been a very political person over the years, I\u2019ve gotten as many zone changes as any human being on earth, probably, including the entire West Side of Manhattan from 77nd Street to 59th Street. A very successful job. I would say that every time I see somebody make that statement and then they\u2019re feeling good and doing a great job, and they run, they lose because of that statement. So I would never want to say that four years . . . I would never want to limit myself to four years. I think I can do a tremendous job in four years. One of your questions, I noticed, is what would be your first 90 days in terms \u2014 and we\u2019ll talk about that next.\n\nBW: Good.\n\nDT: But, so I think I can do a terrific job. And I think this: if I\u2019m doing a terrific job, and if I\u2019m feeling well, I would say I would continue to go for the extra four years. Because again, I don\u2019t want to put that burden on myself. If I\u2019m doing a good job, I should be allowed. And I only say that because you know, Bob, I\u2019ve seen so many people say it. Even for local positions. And if they decide to then go, they always lose because they make that statement. So I don\u2019t want to say that. But I think I will be able to do a fantastic job in four years.\n\nBW: Real quickly, at the Post editorial board interview, you referred to the $19 trillion in debt, and then you said the U.S. is \u201cprobably sitting on a bubble.\u201d\n\nDT: Yeah, a bubble.\n\nBW: What bubble?\n\nDT: Well, I think we\u2019re sitting on an economic bubble. A financial bubble. I think if you look at the stock market...\n\nBW: In the stock market you mean?\n\nDT: Yeah.\n\nBW: Or do you mean . . . .\n\nDT: Well first of all, we\u2019re not at five percent unemployment. We\u2019re at a number that\u2019s probably into the twenties if you look at the real number. That was a number that was devised, statistically devised to make politicians \u2014 and in particular presidents \u2014 look good. And I wouldn\u2019t be getting the kind of massive crowds that I\u2019m getting if the number was a real number. People are extremely unhappy in this country.\n\nBW: And so is the bubble \u2014 it\u2019s not a housing bubble.\n\nDT: No, no, I\u2019m talking about . . . .\n\nBW: Or a real estate building bubble.\n\nDT: I\u2019m talking about a bubble where you go into a very massive recession. Hopefully not worse than that, but a very massive recession. Look, we have money that\u2019s so cheap right now. And if I want to borrow money, I can borrow all the money I want. But I\u2019m rich. If a person that wants to put a lot of people to. . . . And I don\u2019t need the money. I don\u2019t have to borrow. I don\u2019t even call banks anymore. I use my own money to do things. If I want to borrow money or if another rich person wants to borrow money, you can borrow money at, like, LIBOR plus nothing. And you\u2019re paying one and a half percent interest, it\u2019s crazy, and they\u2019ll give you all you want. If somebody is a great, wonderful person, going to employ lots of people, a really talented businessperson, wants to borrow money but they\u2019re not rich? They have no chance.\n\nBW: Bubbles are scary to economists.\n\nDT: Oh, bubbles are scary.\n\nBW: Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Fed, used to say, there may be a bubble out there but you don\u2019t know it\u2019s a bubble until it bursts. Is that true?\n\nDT: Yeah. That\u2019s true. I think that\u2019s true. I think you had a lot of signs, because you had all those exploding mortgages. I told . . . .\n\nBW: And you say there are signs now.\n\nDT: . . . people.\n\nBW: We\u2019re \u201csitting on a bubble.\u201d\n\nDT: Okay, so I made many speeches for different groups on success, where people would pay me a lot of money, I gave it to charity. People would pay me money for speeches on success. So I would do that, before this. And I would tell people, don\u2019t invest that, don\u2019t go \u2013 I was pretty good at prognostication, at telling people what to do in terms of. . . . Now, I\u2019d talk about success, but I\u2019d say, this is a bad time to invest. I also said, this is a good time to invest.\n\nBW: What is it now? Is it a good time to invest now?\n\nDT: Oh, I think it\u2019s a terrible time right now.\n\nBW: You really do?\n\nDT: Yeah.\n\nRC: Why is that?\n\nDT: Because the dollar is so strong. Our country is in \u2013 you know, it\u2019s very interesting. There\u2019s a couple of things good about strong dollars, but there\u2019s some...\n\nBW: So your tip, stock tip, is to get out of the market? Or avoid it now?\n\nDT: Oh, my stock tip is that the market \u2013 I believe we\u2019re sitting on a big bubble. So you take a look at what\u2019s going on. You have \u2014 think of it \u2014 you have cheap money that nobody can get unless you\u2019re rich. You have the regulators are running the banks. Not the guys that are being paid $50 million a year to run the banks. I mean, when you look at many of your friends that are running banks that are being paid $40 and $50 million, yeah, they\u2019re not running the banks. The regulators are running the banks. You have a situation where you have an inflated stock market. It started to deflate, but then it went back up again. Usually that\u2019s a bad sign. That\u2019s a sign of things to come. And yeah, I think we\u2019re sitting on a very, very big bubble.\n\nBW: So the Wall Street people are going to \u2014 when we publish this \u2014 are not going to like to hear the possible president say . . . .\n\nDT: Yeah, I don\u2019t care about the. . . . I know the Wall Street people. I know the Wall Street people probably better than anybody knows them. You know, the Wall Street . . . .\n\nBW: You don\u2019t need them either?\n\nDT: No. No. You know, I don\u2019t need them. No, other candidates need them, by the way. Ted Cruz needs them. Ted Cruz borrowed millions of dollars for his [political-action committees].\n\nBW: But doesn\u2019t this go back to the coalition? I\u2019m sorry.\n\nDT: And by the way, and didn\u2019t disclose on his personal financials that he was borrowing money from Goldman Sachs and Citibank and didn\u2019t \u2014 and paying almost no interest. He had an interest rate that you would\u2019ve been proud to have, and he didn\u2019t disclose it. Which nobody made a big deal out of. You did a little bit. But no I do, I think we\u2019re sitting \u2014 it\u2019s precarious times. Part of the reason it\u2019s precarious is because we are being ripped so badly by other countries. We are being ripped so badly by China. It just never ends. Nobody\u2019s ever going to stop it. And the reason they\u2019re not going to stop it is one of two. They\u2019re either living in a world of the make believe, or they\u2019re totally controlled by their lobbyists and their special interests. Meaning people that want it to continue. Because what China, what Mexico, what Japan \u2014 I don\u2019t want to name too many countries, because I actually do business in a lot of these countries \u2013 but what these countries are doing to us is unbelievable. They are draining our jobs. They are draining our money. They are taking the money out . . . .\n\nBW: So you are really pessimistic, to say the least?\n\nDT: I\u2019m pessimistic. Unless changes are made. Changes could be made.\n\nBW: Could you fix it? Next year, if you became president?\n\nDT: Yes, I can fix it. I can fix it pretty quickly.\n\nBW: Okay. Tell us that.\n\nDT: When I was at your editorial board meeting, I talked about NATO. And I\u2019m not a world expert on NATO. But I have a natural instinct for certain things, okay? Like I said, keep the oil. Well, now ISIS has the oil. I said a lot of things. I said in my book about \u2014 written in 2000 \u2014 mentioned Bin Laden in a paragraph or two. And that was two years before the World Trade Center came down. And I\u2019m not a politician, I was . . . .\n\nRC: So what\u2019s your instinct, your plan, for let\u2019s say first 100 days, how you turn this all around?\n\nDT: Okay, well, I say this. Look: We are making, and we have, some of the worst trade deals in the history of trade. We\u2019re now making one, Trans-Pacific Partnership. TPP. A disaster, that deal is a disaster.\n\nBW: You know lots of experts, supposedly, disagree with you on the trade issues and so forth. Feel . . . .\n\nDT: Yeah. Oh, I was against NAFTA.\n\nBW: And there\u2019s a lot of analysis, and a lot of data.\n\nDT: I was against NAFTA. NAFTA\u2019s been a disaster. I mean, frankly, I\u2019m a big Ronald Reagan fan, but I disagreed with him on trade. I thought his trade policies were terrible.\n\nBW: So the first 100 days, what would you do?\n\nDT: Okay. I would do a number of things. I would, number one, I would start negotiating great trade deals using \u2014 I know the best people. You know. . . .\n\nBW: You think that can turn around in 100 days?\n\nDT: No, no, it can\u2019t, no, but I would start the negotiation. No, these are complicated transactions. Part of the problem with the TPP is it\u2019s 12 countries. Okay? And you should do individual country deals. It\u2019s 7,000 pages long. And each one of those countries has studied this thing, photographic. We have congressmen, they don\u2019t even read these agreements.\n\nRC: But this is a \u2013 that would be driven out of the executive branch, that kind of negotiation.\n\nDT: Yeah. It\u2019s a bad deal. It\u2019s a bad deal for our country.\n\nRC: What about legislation? What about economic legislation?\n\nDT: Well, I know, but it\u2019s a bad deal for our country. What I would do \u2013 and before I talk about legislation, because I think frankly this is more important \u2013 number one, it\u2019s going to be a very big tax cut. Because the middle class has been. . . . And Larry Kudlow and numerous people have liked very much. . . . You know, I put in a plan for tax cuts, and I\u2019ve gotten some very good reviews. I would do a tax cut. You have to do a tax cut. Because we\u2019re the highest-taxed nation in the world. But I would start \u2014 because I noticed your question briefly \u2014 boom, what would you do in the first 90 days? I would immediately start renegotiating our trade deals with Mexico, China, Japan and all of these countries that are just absolutely destroying us. And they have been for years. It\u2019s an incredible tribute to our country that we can lose billions \u2014 hundreds of billions \u2014 of dollars consistently, year in and year out \u2014 and still even survive. We have rebuilt China. We have rebuilt it. I mean, you look at what\u2019s going on in China. We have rebuilt China single-handedly. Now, they\u2019ve done okay with Europe too, but . . . .\n\nRC: So renegotiate trade deals and have a tax cut. That would be your first 100 days?\n\nDT: Renegotiate trade deals and renegotiate military deals.\n\nRC: Real quick on trade deals...\n\nDT: And by the way, and renegotiate with NATO. And renegotiate with Japan and with...\n\nRC: On trade deals, dealing with a company, on your business deals, when you study them, it\u2019s dealing with people and corporations.\n\nDT: And I\u2019m negotiating over 100 deals. We\u2019re negotiating 114 deals.\n\nRC: But aren\u2019t deals with countries and foreign leaders different than the kind of transactions you do at the corporate level? And how do you make that transition?\n\nDT: No.\n\nRC: Because you can\u2019t say to a country, I\u2019m going to sue you.\n\nDT: No. Well, you know, it depends on what your definition of \u201csue\u201d is. We will be able to make great trade deals. It\u2019ll be good for the counties, it will be good for us.\n\nBW: How long will it take? A year? Two years?\n\nDT: It will go. . . . Yeah, I would say within the first year a lot of it will be done.\n\nBW: Sir, in listening to this . . .\n\nDT: But you have to be able to walk. You have to be able to . . . .\n\nBW: . . . and covering lots of presidents, if I may go back to that experience.\n\nDT: Go ahead.\n\nBW: Trying to understand them. Reagan was Morning in America. And it\u2019s almost like you\u2019re saying, at least for a while, morning in the ditch. That we are just not going to be able to get out because of these trade deals, because of your pessimism about the economy.\n\nDT: Look, we are losing $500 billion a year on trade deficits with China. Okay? We\u2019ve been for a long time, from 200 to 500. We are losing hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars a year on trade. You look at Japan. They send their cars in here by the hundreds of thousands. You go to Los Angeles, you look at those docks, and these cars get driven off those boats at 40 miles an hour. You\u2019ve never seen anything like it. They just come pouring into our country. And yet when \u2014 you talk about an imbalance, when it comes to us selling to Japan? They take very little.\n\nBW: Where\u2019s the optimism to get out of this?\n\nDT: Oh, I have great optimism.\n\nBW: You do?\n\nDT: Oh. Oh, okay. With all of that, I\u2019m an optimistic person. You know, \u201cMake America great again.\u201d . . .\n\nBW: Oh yeah. What\u2019s the . . . .\n\nDT: Make America great again. That\u2019s actually a very optimistic \u2014 you know, that\u2019s not \u2014 some people say, oh, that\u2019s so \u2014because they hate the word \u201cagain.\u201d I said, \"No, no, you don\u2019t understand. We\u2019re going to make America great again.\" People view that as very positive. Do you know, workers. . . . . You can have that [unclear] question. I dictated this out pretty much.\n\nCL: [unclear] we have [unclear] in 15 minutes.\n\nDT: But you know what, we can delay that meeting for 20 minutes. I love this.\n\nCL: I know, but it\u2019s a very important \u2014 and it\u2019s respectful. I just \u2014 we set it up, and . . . .\n\nDT: Could you call them up and say could we delay half an hour?\n\nCL: I can, but we promised these guys an hour, [unclear] an hour and 15.\n\nDT: [unclear] Call them back, tell them we\u2019ll be 45 minutes late, is it okay? Only if it\u2019s okay. If he can\u2019t do it...\n\nCL: I don\u2019t know. Let me find out.\n\nDT: Okay. Because I\u2019d like to finish with these guys.\n\nBW: Thank you. We appreciate it.\n\nDT: So just so you understand, mine is a message of great optimism. We can fix it.\n\nRC: But not everyone thinks that, right?\n\nDT: No, no. Not everybody thinks that. Some people don\u2019t understand that.\n\nRC: Bob was in New Haven, Connecticut, the other day, and he met a maid in a hotel who identified herself as Mexican. And one of the things she said was, \u201cHe does not like me.\u201d\n\nBW: Meaning you. I asked her about you. What do you think of Trump?\n\nDT: Was she here...\n\nRC: And she said, \u201cAll I want is my dignity.\u201d\n\nDT: Yeah. I\u2019ll give her great dignity. Let me hear the question \u2013 you may not know the answer.\n\nRC: What do you have to say to her?\n\nDT: Was she here legally or illegally?\n\nBW: I asked her, and she would not say.\n\nDT: That means she was here illegally. Okay. So here . . . .\n\nBW: Possibly. And she says . . . Trump, I asked her, I said, what do you think of Mr. Trump? And she said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like me.\u201d She took it personally. And then she said, \u201cI just want my dignity.\u201d\n\nDT: I understand that.\n\nBW: What would you say to her?\n\nDT: I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019d say to her. Number one, she was probably here illegally. The polls are all showing people \u2014 Hispanics \u2014 that are here legally like me very much. In Nevada, you saw the poll, I\u2019m leading with the Hispanics. People that vote, people that therefore are here. I\u2019m leading with Hispanics. People that are here illegally maybe feel differently and they do feel differently, but people that are here legally, Hispanics that are here, they don\u2019t want their jobs taken. And they know I\u2019ll bring jobs back from China. I\u2019ll bring jobs back from Japan and from Mexico and from all these countries. You look at what Mexico\u2019s doing, Bob. Mexico is the new China, smaller level. Mexico, what they\u2019re doing to us on trade and at the border is unbelievable. Okay? And I was right. When I got up and made that initial speech in Trump Tower on June 16, and I talked about illegal immigration and the problems, that hit a nerve. You know? Because . . . .\n\nRC: It\u2019s not all economic. Because some of these people we encounter on the campaign trail, whether it\u2019s an undocumented Mexican maid or it\u2019s a Muslim, one consequence of your campaign has been they feel isolated in America. And you may disagree with the reason they feel that, but that is how they feel as a consequence of your message. How do you speak to those people who think you don\u2019t want them in this country? Including Muslims.\n\nDT: I am a person that\u2019s going to bring this country together. I\u2019m a person that\u2019s going to unify the country. President Obama is a divider. He is not a unifier. When he first got elected, I didn\u2019t have great feelings for the fact that he was going to do well. But the one thing I thought, he would be able to unify the country. African American, white, I thought that he would be a unifying factor. He has not been. He\u2019s been a great . . . .\n\nBW: But Bob Costa\u2019s right, Mr. Trump, that you talk to people and they feel you\u2019re not a unifier.\n\nDT: I know. They feel that now.\n\nBW: And you say you are. The question becomes . . . I mean, this is one maid, but I think there are a countless number of people out there who, in essence maybe they could not put it in this articulate way, they want their dignity, and the question is, how are they going to get it from you if you\u2019re president?\n\nDT: Well again, so I asked you the very important question, was she here legally or illegally?\n\nBW: I don\u2019t know.\n\nDT: Because if she was here legally, I think you would find that she would like me very much. In Nevada, where you have a huge Hispanic population, when they did the exit polls, I won with the people that are Hispanic in the state of Nevada. But not by a little bit, by a lot. I think that\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s an important question to ask. I will give people back their dignity because I\u2019m going to bring jobs back. Our jobs are being taken away from us like candy from a baby. Our jobs are being ripped out of our country. Carrier announced \u2014 I talked about it the last month, because I thought that was in particular bad. Maybe because I buy a lot of Carrier air conditioners. But . . . .\n\nRC: People understand the economic argument. But people \u2014 I think what she was looking for, and others \u2014 is do you have empathy for the immigrant experience? You think back to your grandfather coming over in 1885.\n\nDT: That\u2019s right. Totally. I do. I mean, totally. I mean, ultimately we\u2019re all immigrants, okay? I have total empathy. At the same time, we need borders, otherwise we don\u2019t have a country, and we have to be \u2013 you have to come into the country legally. And that\u2019s been a big theme of my campaign, and for the most part, I think it\u2019s [unclear].\n\nBW: But this maid doesn\u2019t have a lawyer, I suspect. And she came to the country, we don\u2019t know. And she didn\u2019t do anything that put her in the position she may be in, you\u2019re right. And what she\u2019s saying is \u2014 and I was floored by what she said, quite frankly. \u201cI just want my dignity.\u201d\n\nDT: Yeah. Well.\n\nBW: And a giant question, pulsing out there, is how do people get their dignity that you seem to be quite critical of? Illegal immigrants . . . .\n\nDT: No. I\u2019m . . . .\n\nBW: Well, you are critical.\n\nDT: Well, illegal immigrants, yeah. Just so you understand, I want people to come into this country. I want to make it much easier to come into the country. But they have to come in through a legal process. Were you able to do that, Corey? Huh?\n\nCL: Yeah.\n\nDT: We have a meeting with \u2014 sort of an important meeting.\n\nBW: Yeah, the foreign policy people.\n\nDT: Well actually we already met with them. We just . . . .\n\nBW: Oh you did? How\u2019d that go?\n\nDT: It went great.\n\n[Lewandowski speaks inaudibly.]\n\nDT: I\u2019d love to keep it going. I actually enjoy this. I\u2019ll probably end up ruing the day. I\u2019ll say, how could they have said that stuff about me? But I do really enjoy this . . . .\n\nBW: I understand that. And you know, these are such serious questions, and you are answering them with \u2014 you\u2019re being straight about it. I appreciate that.\n\nDT: Here\u2019s what \u2014 I think I\u2019ll do really great. With the African Americans. And a lot of people think that. And you know that a lot of people think that. But I think I\u2019m going to do great with the African Americans. I think I\u2019m going to do great with Hispanics. I\u2019m going to bring jobs back to the country. I\u2019m not going to let people take our jobs. I\u2019m not going to let people go \u2014 I\u2019m not going to let factories and Nabisco and all of these companies \u2014 Ford \u2014 we\u2019re going to build here. We\u2019re going to keep the jobs in our country. And we\u2019re going to bring jobs back to our country, Bob. And that\u2019s going to . . . .\n\nBW: Understand. Let me ask, this is a really . . . .\n\nDT: Jobs is a very big answer, because that\u2019s going to give . . . .\n\nBW: Of course. Although this maid has a job.\n\nDT: That\u2019s right. But dignity. And maybe she\u2019ll have a better job. She\u2019ll have more options.\n\nBW: Okay. What would be the most challenging situation that, say you\u2019re president, or the next president, might face? And this is a serious issue. I asked President Obama this a number of years ago. And he said, what I worry about most \u2014 sitting in the Oval Office, and I think he really meant this \u2014 I worry the most about a nuclear weapon going off in an American city.\n\nDT: Okay.\n\nBW: That is the game-changer.\n\nDT: It\u2019s funny, it\u2019s very interesting. I\u2019m surprised he said that, because I heard him recently say that the biggest problem we have is global warming, which I totally disagree with. Okay?\n\nBW: But he told me . . . .\n\nDT: Okay.\n\nBW: Sat there. And I thought, you can read between \u2013 do you agree with that?\n\nDT: It\u2019s very interesting. I have . . . I absolutely agree. I think the single greatest problem that the world has \u2014 we have an ISIS problem, and we have \u2014 but the single greatest problem that this world has is a nuclear, the power of nuclear. The tremendous power. You look at Hiroshima and multiply it times a thousand.\n\nBW: And he\u2019s, President Obama\u2019s having this summit now, right here in Washington, down the street. And he is a strong advocate for eliminating nuclear weapons entirely.\n\nDT: Okay.\n\nBW: Would you agree with that?\n\nDT: Well, if it\u2019s done on equal basis, absolutely.\n\nBW: You would.\n\nDT: But the problem you have now. . . . Done on an equal basis. The problem you have now is you have Pakistan. And you just see what happened in Pakistan. It\u2019s not like, you know, that\u2019s a perfect situation. You have India. You have so many countries now with nuclear already. You have some very bad people trying very hard to get nuclear. So I think that\u2019s something that in an ideal world is wonderful, but I think it\u2019s not going to happen very easily.\n\nBW: Would you pick up the baton on that effort on his part?\n\nDT: I would love to see a nuclear-free world. Will that happen? Chances are extremely small that will happen. Look, Russia right now is spending a tremendous amount of money on re-doing their entire nuclear arsenal.\n\nRC: When you look at foreign policy . . . .\n\nDT: By the way, I love that. But from a practical standpoint, not going to happen.\n\nRC: Did you read Jeffrey Goldberg\u2019s article about Obama\u2019s foreign policy? In the Atlantic, Obama gave . . . .\n\nDT: In the Atlantic, okay.\n\nRC: So one of the quotes Obama said in there is, \u201cThe notion that Russia is somehow in a stronger position now in Syria and Ukraine than they were before they invaded Ukraine or before he had to deploy military forces in Syria is to fundamentally misunderstand the nature of power in foreign affairs. Real power means you can get what you want without having to exert violence.\u201d That\u2019s Obama on global power. Do you agree?\n\nDT: Well, I think there\u2019s a certain truth to that. I think there\u2019s a certain truth to that. Real power is through respect. Real power is, I don\u2019t even want to use the word, fear. But you know, our military is very sadly depleted. You look at what\u2019s going on with respect to our military and it\u2019s depleted from all of the cuts. Hey, as a real estate person, all the time I\u2019m getting listings of bases, Army bases, Marine bases, naval bases. I keep saying, how many bases do they have? I\u2019m constantly getting, it\u2019s crossing my desk, do we want to buy a base in Virginia? Do we want to buy. . . . And I see it all the time. We have to strengthen our military. It\u2019s so vital to do that. We have to strengthen our military. By the way, we have to take care of our vets. So vital. But we have to strengthen our military. Now, one of the things that The Washington Post treated me very badly on, when I talked to you about NATO, we\u2019re spending too much money, and we\u2019re not getting treated with respect from the 28 countries that we\u2019re dealing with.\n\nRC: This comes back to the Lone Ranger point. I think even globally, you\u2019re comfortable being the United States president.\n\nDT: No.\n\nRC: Not being an interventionist . . . .\n\nDT: I didn\u2019t say I\u2019d get out of NATO. I say it\u2019s got to be. . . . First of all, it\u2019s obsolete. Our big threat today is terrorism. Okay? And NATO\u2019s not really set up for terrorism. NATO is set up for the Soviet Union more than anything else. And now you don\u2019t have the Soviet Union.\n\nRC: Well, you don\u2019t have a great belief in these international institutions.\n\nDT: No, because we seem to get ripped off by everybody. We seem to always be the one that pays the bill and gets the least. And we\u2019re going to stop doing that.\n\nBW: But you\u2019re talking about reform of NATO, aren\u2019t you, rather than . . . .\n\nDT: Yes, I\u2019m talking about reform.\n\nBW: You\u2019re not just saying, let\u2019s move out.\n\nDT: I\u2019m talking totally about reform. But you have to be \u2014 in order to get reform, you have to be prepared to walk. Otherwise you can\u2019t get reform. For instance, the Iran deal. Had John Kerry stood up from his chair when they kept saying no, no, no, no \u2014 he didn\u2019t get anything. Had he stood up twice \u2014 once or twice \u2014 from his chair and said, sorry gentlemen, we\u2019re leaving, and increased the sanctions, you would\u2019ve had a whole different Iran deal.\n\nBW: Okay. One really important question.\n\nDT: Go ahead.\n\nBW: A couple of years ago, I had a breakfast with one of the leaders, heads of state, of our best allies. And I asked him about Obama. And he was talking off the record, and he said, \u201cI like him. He is smart. But no one in the world is afraid of him.\u201d Do you agree with that? And in a Trump administration \u2014 are you formulating a new doctrine of you better be afraid of me?\n\nDT: Yeah, I don\u2019t want people to be afraid. I want them to respect our country. Right now, they don\u2019t respect our country.\n\nBW: But do they respect you if you kind of . . . .\n\nDT: People have respected me. My life has been a life where I\u2019ve been respected. I want them to respect our country. I want them to respect our leader. But I want them to respect our country. Now, you could use . . . .\n\nBW: How do you achieve that, sir?\n\nDT: Through the aura of personality. Through having the goods. You know, so Muhammad Ali is a friend of mine. He\u2019s a good guy. I\u2019ve watched many people over the years. Muhammad Ali would get in the ring and he\u2019d talk and talk and scream and talk about the ugly bear, and this, that \u2014 you know. And then he\u2019d win. And respect is about winning. We don\u2019t win anymore. I see it in my \u2014 we don\u2019t win anymore. And he\u2019d win. I\u2019ve seen many fighters that were better than Muhammad Ali, in terms of talking. I\u2019ve seen guys that were so beautiful, so flamboyant, they\u2019d get into the ring \u2014 and then they\u2019d get knocked out. And guess what? It\u2019s all gone. Let me just say: we don\u2019t win anymore.\n\nBW: So do you want Putin to be afraid of you?\n\nDT: I want Putin to respect our country, okay?\n\nBW: And what would he respect?\n\nDT: Well, first of all, it\u2019s sort of interesting. He said very good things about me.\n\nBW: Understand.\n\nDT: You saw that. He said, Trump is brilliant and Trump is going to be the new leader and all that. And some of these clowns said, you should repudiate Putin. I said, why would I repudiate him? He\u2019s not going to get anything. Because I\u2019ve been through this stuff before. But he said very positive things about me. And I say to myself \u2014 and I say to people \u2014 wouldn\u2019t it be nice if we actually could get along with Russia? And if we could get along with these people? China takes advantage of us. Look at what they\u2019re doing in the South China Sea. They\u2019re not supposed to be playing that game. Okay? Look at what they\u2019re doing. That is a lack of respect. When they\u2019re building a massive, like nobody\u2019s ever seen before \u2014 they\u2019re building islands in the middle of the South China Sea for a massive military complex. Beyond runways. I mean, this is a complex. So what I\u2019m saying is there\u2019s a tremendous lack of respect for our country. And I think for our leader.\n\nBW: But what does Putin respect? The former KGB lieutenant colonel? Force. Power.\n\nDT: I think he respects strength. Okay? I think Putin respects strength. And I\u2019ve said it before, I think I will get along well with Putin. Now you never know. I don\u2019t say that \u2013 only a fool would say, \u201cI will,\u201d but I feel that I will get along well with Putin. I feel that if we can get along with more countries, that\u2019s a positive thing. That\u2019s not a bad thing. Some people \u2014 for instance, when Putin came out and he wanted to bomb the hell out of ISIS, we had people standing on the stage, we don\u2019t want that, we want. . . . Let me tell you something. If we have somebody else dropping bombs that cost a half a million dollars a piece on the top \u2014 if we have somebody helping us, that\u2019s not so bad. You understand that. That\u2019s not so bad. But I had people that I\u2019m running against saying, like, that was a terrible thing. It\u2019s not a terrible thing. We have a situation in Libya where a friend of mine is just saying, so, we had Gaddafi, he killed the terrorists, he ran his place. Not a good man. Same thing you could say with Iraq, with Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein was a plus-10 at killing terrorists, that\u2019s one thing. If our presidents would have gone away and gone to the beach, the Middle East would be a far better place than it is right now. I don\u2019t say it would be run by nice people, but you know, it would be a far better place. The mistakes we\u2019ve made in the Middle East are so astronomical. Now here\u2019s the thing: ISIS is now. . . . A friend of mine who\u2019s very much involved in the energy business, ISIS is controlling the oil now in Libya. How did we let that happen?\n\nRC: So just turning back.\n\nDT: And by the way, that oil? That is a great oil, and it\u2019s a lot of oil. And they\u2019re controlling it.\n\nRC: We were looking over your 1990 book, Surviving at the Top.\n\nDT: Right.\n\nRC: And thinking about, what would happen if Trump\u2019s president of the United States? And you \u2014 this is a line from your book, then: \u201cThe same assets that excite me in the chase often, once they are acquired, leave me bored. For me, you see, the important thing is the getting, not the having.\u201d If you get the presidency, you are going to have it.\n\nDT: Yeah, but see, that\u2019s not the getting. The getting, for me, is to make our country great again. The getting \u2014 that\u2019s just a part of it. The getting the position is not the real getting. For me, the getting is \u2014 and that\u2019s when I\u2019ll say, congratulations everyone, my job is finished. We will make our country financially strong again. When you have 19 . . . I had a woman come up to me. A wonderful woman. I said this one or two times in the speech. She said, \"Mr. Trump, I love you. You\u2019re so incredible. I\u2019m voting for you 100 percent, but could you stop saying you\u2019re going to make our country rich again?\" I said, \"I understand what you\u2019re saying \u2013 it doesn\u2019t sound nice. But without being rich again, we can\u2019t be great again.\" I am going to make our country rich again. We are, the thing I didn\u2019t like about The Washington Post, they didn\u2019t put down my real statements as to Japan and everything else. They make it sound like I want Japan to have nuclear weapons. I don\u2019t. And by the way, other people have said this too. I don\u2019t mind taking care of Japan. But they have to help us out more, monetarily. We can\u2019t protect the entire world. You look at our military budget, it\u2019s massive compared to any other country. But what are we doing? We\u2019re taking care of the military needs of all these countries. And these countries are much richer than us. We\u2019re not a rich country. We\u2019re a debtor nation. We\u2019ve got to get rid of \u2014 I talked about bubble. We\u2019ve got to get rid of the $19 trillion in debt.\n\nBW: How long would that take?\n\nDT: I think I could do it fairly quickly, because of the fact the numbers . . . .\n\nBW: What\u2019s fairly quickly?\n\nDT: Well, I would say over a period of eight years. And I\u2019ll tell you why.\n\nBW: Would you ever be open to tax increases as part of that, to solve the problem?\n\nDT: I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll need to. The power is trade. Our deals are so bad.\n\nBW: That would be $2 trillion a year.\n\nDT: No, but I\u2019m renegotiating all of our deals, Bob. The big trade deals that we\u2019re doing so badly on. With China, $505 billion this year in trade. We\u2019re losing with everybody. And a lot of those deals \u2014 a lot of people say, how could the politicians be so stupid? It\u2019s not that they\u2019re stupid. It\u2019s that they\u2019re controlled by lobbyists and special interests who want those deals to be made.\n\nBW: So we want to go back and tell our readers about this interview, and we\u2019ll run the transcript of it, I\u2019m sure. When does the coalition building begin?\n\nDT: You\u2019re talking now again?\n\nBW: For Trump.\n\nCLi: [Unclear], do you want me to cancel the other meeting? Because he has a hard out, and we\u2019re already late.\n\nDT: Let me give you this final answer, and then if you want we can meet again.\n\nBW: Yes. Okay, that\u2019s great. Is that . . . .\n\nDT: . . . Phase two. We\u2019ll call it \u2013 at least treat me fairly in phase one, but phase two.\n\nBW: Of course.\n\nDT: The coalition building begins \u2014 I believe \u2014 when it\u2019s decided who wins. Hopefully I\u2019m going to win. The coalition building for me will be when I win. Vince Lombardi, I saw this. He was not a big man. And I was sitting in a place with some very, very tough football players. Big, strong football players. He came in \u2014 these are tough cookies \u2014 he came in, years ago \u2014 and I\u2019ll never forget it, I was a young man. He came in, screaming, into this place. And screaming at one of these guys who was three times bigger than him, literally. And very physical, grabbing him by the shirt. Now, this guy could\u2019ve whisked him away and thrown him out the window in two seconds. This guy \u2014 the player \u2014 was shaking. A friend of mine. There were four players, and Vince Lombardi walked in. He was angry. And he grabbed \u2014 I was a young guy \u2014 he grabbed him by the shirt, screaming at him, and the guy was literally. . . . And I said, wow. And I realized the only way Vince Lombardi got away with that was because he won. This was after he had won so much, okay? And when you have these coaches that are just as tough as him but they don\u2019t win, there\u2019s revolutions. Okay? Nobody. . . . But Vince Lombardi was able to win, and he got \u2014 I have never seen anything like it. It was such a vivid impression. You had this big powerful guy, and you had Vince Lombardi, and he grabbed him by the shirt and he was screaming at him, he was angry at him.\n\nBW: But to do that \u2014 a colleague of ours . . . .\n\nDT: No, to do that you have to win.\n\nBW: Yes. But David Maraniss, a colleague of ours, wrote the book on Vince Lombardi.\n\nDT: Yeah.\n\nBW: \"When Pride Still Mattered.\" Right? What Vince Lombardi did, he got to the point of winning by building a coalition of 11 players on the field. He couldn\u2019t have a guard and a tackle who were not part of the team.\n\nDT: Okay, let me answer this way, because I think it will be a very positive ending. Because I agree with you. Ultimately, I will build a coalition. I think it\u2019s too soon. I really do. I think it\u2019s too soon. Now, I may be wrong. But this isn\u2019t something I needed to do. This is something I want to do. I want to give back, and I\u2019ll do a fantastic job. And I know politicians. I know them all. They\u2019re only talented at one thing: getting elected. Now, you have some that have certain assets, but they\u2019re talented at one thing: getting elected. Raising funds, and getting elected. Okay? And when I first ran, Charles Krauthammer said, and this was before I had run, and he was sitting there \u2014 I told you this story. He was sitting on Fox. And he said, this is one of the most talented fields of senators and governors and people running for office in the history of our country, and certainly since World War II. Now this is about two months before I\u2019m announcing. And I\u2019m saying to myself, wow. That\u2019s tough. You know, here\u2019s a guy who must know. It\u2019s tough. They also said I wouldn\u2019t run and I ran. But I said, wow, that\u2019s a big statement. I said, all right, but I\u2019m doing it. Then I decide \u2014 top of the escalator \u2014 I said to my wife, come on, let\u2019s go. Deep breath, went down, did it. Okay. Now I\u2019ve defeated those people, most of them. I\u2019ve defeated them. And I say, really? Meaning to his statement. Really? Not a lot of talent.\n\nBW: So we have on the media, which you are quite critical . . . .\n\nDT: Media treats me very unfairly, and very inaccurately.\n\nBW: Okay, and the question is, why? And if I may, Richard Nixon, something he said . . . about the media, what it does, the media looks in the mirror instead of looking out the window \u2014 and gather facts and listen to other people \u2014 they\u2019re more interested in themselves. Is that part of the problem?\n\nDT: Well, I think they\u2019re more interested in hits. I did a thing the other day with \u2014 on CNN \u2014 with Anderson Cooper. I don\u2019t know if you saw the rating. Give him the ratings, if you have it. Do you have the ratings?\n\nRC: We saw it.\n\nHH: You have them, sir.\n\nDT: They were through \u2014 I just got this. They were through the roof. Here. Mine was through the roof, meaning my hour was through the roof. Now, that\u2019s good and bad. The bad is they want to cover me too much, and they write things that maybe they shouldn\u2019t be writing. But those were phenomenal. Won the evening, beat everybody, et cetera, et cetera. My segment, not the other segments. The other segments did all right, but my segment was one of the highest-rated shows in a long time and beat everybody on cable \u2014 beat everybody on television that night. So you\u2019ll take a look. That\u2019s good and it\u2019s bad. The bad is they want to do nothing but cover me. They write stories that are \u2014 that don\u2019t even make sense. I\u2019m just saying, I wish I could be covered accurately and fairly by the media.\n\nBW: By why, then? Is this ideology, is this partisanship, is it laziness? What is it?\n\nDT: Well, it could be some laziness. Today they want the clicks. In the old days they wanted the ratings, or they wanted to sell newspapers. Today they see if somebody clicks. So they do a story on me and they get clicks all over the place. They do a story on somebody else, it doesn\u2019t matter. All I can say is this. I wish I could be treated fairly by the media. And if I was treated fairly by the media, I think you would see a very big difference in coalition and coalition building and a lot of things. But with that being said, I\u2019m not ready to do coalition building. But when I do \u2014 I tell that Vince Lombardi story \u2014 if and when I win, it will be really easy to build up a coalition. One other thing. I told you this. We are getting calls from so many people that you speak to, you speak to, that are saying, oh we don\u2019t like Trump, we\u2019ve got to stop Trump. They\u2019re calling me. They\u2019re talking to you and they\u2019re calling me. Because they think I\u2019m going to win.\n\nRC: Well the next step is getting them off the phone and out into the public.\n\nDT: Yeah, but we\u2019re already \u2014 look, we already have. . . . Chris came in, and Carson came in. We already have a lot of people. We are getting calls from people that you\u2019re writing about, or other people are writing about, and I\u2019m telling you, names that you wouldn\u2019t believe. Bob, you \u2014 the greatest skeptic probably of all time \u2014 even more than you. That\u2019s only because he\u2019s older than you. He\u2019s seen more. People that you wouldn\u2019t even think about would be calling are calling. They want to make a deal. They want to come on board.\n\nRC: But you know what they tell us? We call the same people. Or I\u2019ve been calling the same people. You know what they say about Trump? So much promise, political talent, yet he seems to have a blind spot. When he\u2019s ahead, he seems to pull back. That\u2019s maybe not the view you have, I understand. But that is how a lot of Washington people see it. They think you get so close to the nomination, and then things happen . . . .\n\nDT: I can only say this: my whole life has been about winning. My whole life. I\u2019ve won a lot. And one little example? This building. This was one of the most sought-after buildings in the history of the General Services Administration. Owned by them for many years. The landlord to the United States, right? Every major company \u2014 almost everybody \u2014 I don\u2019t have to \u2014obviously, look, the best location in Washington. Right between the Capitol and the White House.\n\nBW: Great building.\n\nDT: The best location, best building. The walls are four foot thick of solid granite. Amazing how they were able to lift it up. I mean, frankly, amazing. This is before they had cranes as we know them today. Unbelievable place. And it will be one of the great hotels in the world. Everybody wanted it. Every hotel company. Everybody. Pritzker wanted it. Who\u2019s closer to Obama than Pritzker? Hyatt wanted it. They had the Jewish Museum all lined up. They had everything all lined up. . . . They own Hyatt. Hyatt didn\u2019t get it. The reason I got it was because I have an unbelievable balance sheet - because they wanted to make sure it got done \u2014 and because of the fact that I had a great concept.\n\nBW: But let\u2019s . . . .\n\nDT: But think of it: I got it in the Obama administration.\n\nBW: Understand.\n\nDT: And people say to me, Bob, how the hell did you get the most sought \u2014 after real estate asset perhaps in the history of the GSA \u2014 and you understand what I mean by that.\n\nBW: Of course.\n\nDT: You know, they have land in the middle of nowhere, nobody cares about it. They say, how did you get the most sought-after asset perhaps in the history of the GSA?\n\nRC: And your political allies say the same exact thing. They appreciate that part of your profile and your skill. They talk about it all the time. All we\u2019re saying is, they also \u2014 they\u2019re concerned that you\u2019re hurting yourself along the way as you get close to the nomination.\n\nDT: Well don\u2019t forget, they\u2019ve been concerned about that 10 times during the course of this last . . . .\n\nBW: Yeah, but here\u2019s what\u2019s going on, we think. And it has to do with psychology. And one of the things you learn, being a reporter, being a builder with your background, is that everyone is concerned about themselves. . . . These people feel disrespected. They feel that they\u2019ve not been given their dignity.\n\nDT: They will be loved. At the right time, they will be loved.\n\nBW: And they want in.\n\nDT: Yeah, I know.\n\nBW: And what, to use your term, you\u2019ve built a wall to a certain extent. You\u2019ve said, I am the Lone Ranger. I am doing this on my own.\n\nDT: No, at the right time I want them in.\n\nBW: Okay, but . . . .\n\nDT: I just think it\u2019s early.\n\nBW: Okay, but suppose you needed to do that sooner.\n\nDT: I\u2019d be capable of doing it. I just think it\u2019s . . . .\n\nBW: Will you call us the day it starts?\n\nDT: I will.\n\nBW: Because that\u2019s . . . .\n\nDT: And some of the people that are calling me \u2014 and maybe I should be calling them \u2014 but some of the people that are calling me and calling him, in all fairness, and calling others, too. One called you. But some of these people that are well-known, and people you\u2019ve \u2014 that would be very interesting to you. These people want in. And I\u2019m taking them in. They\u2019re going to come in.\n\nBW: Maybe you have to reach out, then.\n\nDT: Yeah. Because to a certain extent, I should be calling them, they shouldn\u2019t have to be calling me.\n\nBW: Yes, exactly.\n\nDT: You\u2019re right.\n\nBW: Because it\u2019s coalition building.\n\nRC: Right, that\u2019s the key thing. You\u2019re always talking about people calling you.\n\nDT: And I\u2019m going to be doing that very soon.\n\nCL: I do think it\u2019s fair to say that we have not publicized a lot of our D.C. outreach for specific reasons, and I don\u2019t think the media is aware of that.\n\nHH: Yeah.\n\nCL: Including the foreign policy meetings that you have done, including the private meetings we\u2019ve done.\n\nDT: Well, we had a good meeting this morning for foreign policy, you know, and we\u2019ve had some pretty good meetings.\n\nRC: We\u2019re not questioning that there are organizational efforts. We\u2019re just saying . . . .\n\nDT: No, at the right time. You know, it\u2019s an interesting statement that Bob . . . .\n\nRC: You love talking, though, about how people call you, but we often don\u2019t hear about Trump calling . . . .\n\nDT: No?\n\nRC: We know you called McConnell once or twice.\n\nDT: I should be calling them.\n\nRC: More.\n\nDT: And I will be calling them. As soon as I feel that time is right.\n\nRC: And it goes back to the point about VP: you do acknowledge there is a limitation you have in this town, in this political place of Washington.\n\nDT: Sure, sure. I\u2019ve been a very political person all my life.\n\nRC: Understood.\n\nDT: I\u2019ve been on the other side, but still I\u2019ve been very political . . . .\n\nRC: Different. Donor and a politician.\n\nDT: Well, I\u2019ve gotten unbelievable political things done: zoning. This building. Bob, how did I get this building?\n\nRC: When you call a senator up now, and you pitch yourself, as you near the nomination, what do you say to them? When you\u2019re calling them cold?\n\nDT: Well first of all, I do call some people that have just lost. Meaning, you know, they supported Rubio, they supported this. And we\u2019ve dealt with. . . . Honestly, a lot of people are calling me, but I should be calling them. And in a pretty near distance, right now, already, I\u2019m going to start calling them. But I love the point you\u2019re making. This is a point that you\u2019re making, but it\u2019s a point I agree with. I should be calling . . . .\n\nBW: Yes. Because we have \u2014 it\u2019s not making \u2014 Bob Costa and I are making it because we hear it from people.\n\nDT: Yeah. They don\u2019t know how to get in.\n\nBW: There is the sound of silence. And yeah, exactly.\n\nDT: And then they get vicious. At the right point, I\u2019m going to be calling them. One thing I\u2019m going to do . . . .\n\nBW: Who\u2019s going to be the first call?\n\nDT: I will be call . . . that\u2019s a very good case, I better not tell you that. I\u2019ll let you know when I make it. Okay?\n\nBW: Okay. And we have to have phase . . . .\n\nDT: One quick thing I\u2019m going to do, a lot of people are saying, oh, the judges. . . . To me, the judges \u2014 because there\u2019s going to be a lot of them in these next four years. We\u2019ve got one already that was unexpected in Scalia. So the judges are going to be important. You\u2019re going to have either super-liberal judges, or you\u2019re going to have conservative judges. So important. They don\u2019t know me well enough. Well, what kind of judges? I\u2019m going to do something. It was my idea, and I think it was a good idea. And I spoke to Senator Sessions and I spoke to other people, and I\u2019m getting names. The Federalist people. Some very good people. The Heritage Foundation. I\u2019m getting names, and I\u2019m going to submit a list of about 10 names, 10 or 12 names, as judges. I\u2019m going to announce that these are the judges, in no particular order, that I\u2019m going to put up. And I\u2019m going to guarantee it. I\u2019m going to tell people. Because people are worried that, oh, maybe he\u2019ll put the wrong judge in. Like people \u2014 my sister is on the court of appeals. Very smart. She\u2019s a very smart, very highly respected person. Very smart.\n\nBW: People keep trying to get her to talk, and she won\u2019t.\n\nDT: You know what?\n\nBW: Does she have a nondisclosure agreement?\n\nDT: She\u2019s fantastic. She\u2019s the exact opposite of me. People say, is she really your sister? She\u2019s a brilliant person. Highly respected. When the press calls, I say, listen, they want to do a great story. They actually had a nice story about her in The Washington Post recently. But she doesn\u2019t want to talk to the press, because she feels as a judge she should not be speaking to the press. Something very nice about that. She\u2019s right.\n\nBW: I disagree, but . . . .\n\nDT: As a judge. No, but as a judge.\n\nRC: As a reporter, he disagrees.\n\nDT: Oh, as a reporter. But there\u2019s something nice about that. She feels . . . .\n\nBW: But it\u2019s not just the individual calls, it\u2019s the message of inclusiveness, that it doesn\u2019t come through.\n\nDT: Bob, I\u2019ve been hit very hard.\n\nRC: Here\u2019s the problem I think you may face. You start an inclusive message, you turn that corner. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re the nominee and you say, 'You know what? I\u2019m going to tell Woodward who I called. I\u2019m going to start being a unifier.' But maybe so many bridges have been burned within the party that not everyone\u2019s going to be willing . . . .\n\nDT: It\u2019s possible, but I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019ve been here before.\n\nRC: And you may say to yourself, I wish I had built relationships sooner.\n\nDT: Don\u2019t forget, I\u2019ve been hit hard. I went in one of 17 and they hit me harder than anybody. And I hit back very hard. Harder than they hit me. Jeb: low energy. Little Marco. Names that were devastating. I think the low energy Jeb, all of a sudden you see him running down the street to try and show he\u2019s got high energy. And it wasn\u2019t him, and it became worse. I hit back very hard. I am telling you, almost all of these people that you would never think would ever \u2013 will want to come on board. But I\u2019ve got to win first. That\u2019s why I told you that Vince Lombardi story. Because I think it\u2019s a great story. Anyway, I have to go. Let\u2019s do it again.\n\nBW: Okay. When \u2014 should we do it tomorrow? [Laughter]\n\nDT: Just treat me fairly. Treat me fairly. . . . Actually the truth is these were very interesting.
