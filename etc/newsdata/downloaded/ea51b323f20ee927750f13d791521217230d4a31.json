Officials will continue discussions from today, but the biggest sticking point continues to be the backstop - the plan in place to prevent the return of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nAs it stands, the UK prime minister is bound by law to request a Brexit delay if Parliament does not agree to a new deal - or no-deal - by 19 October. But Mr Johnson says his plan to deal with the backstop issue, revealed last week, will get the backing of MPs.

A suspect in the case, the wife of a US diplomat, left the UK afterwards, despite telling police she did not plan to.

But the author of a recent report looking at the process says it was \"flawed\" and \"fell well short\" of what was needed. Retired High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques also writes in the Daily Mail that a \"malfunctioning police force has not received the necessary oversight\".\n\nHowever, the Independent Office for Police Conduct says its work was \"thorough\".\n\nIn July, Carl Beech, 51, from Gloucester, was jailed for 18 years for making false accusations. Here is the story of his life and his lies.\n\nTrump might not get his wall. It might not matter\n\nBy Thom Poole\n\nAs a re-election strategy, is the US president on to something? It would appear so - although it is unlikely to win him new support.\n\nPolling suggests that, in an already polarised political environment, immigration is the thickest of wedge issues. Think tank Pew found this year that 82% of Republicans were in favour of the wall but for Democrats it was just 6% - the organisation's Director of Political Research Carroll Doherty said it was \"hard to see an issue that's more partisan than that\". Mr Doherty said there was an \"intensity\" felt about immigration by Republican voters that Mr Trump will be targeting again.\n\nRead the full article\n\nWhat the papers say\n\nFrance and the Irish Republic are uniting to frustrate Boris Johnson's Brexit plans, the i reports. But the Times says the PM is determined to push his ideas to replace the backstop. And Metro claims Mr Johnson will stay in 10 Downing Street if removed from office by MPs.
