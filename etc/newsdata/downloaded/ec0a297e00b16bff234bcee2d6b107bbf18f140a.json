On top of getting to know Baker Mayfield, Beckham also participated in a private workout with Colin Kaepernick in June.\n\nFootage of that workout emerged on Instagram on Wednesday.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe video begins with a reminder that Kaepernick has not played in the NFL for 917 days. It then shows Beckham arriving to the workout wearing a No. 7 jersey. We don\u2019t see the back of Beckham\u2019s jersey, but Kaepernick wore No. 7 during his career.\n\n[Watch NFL games on your phone for FREE with the Yahoo Sports app.]\n\nThe video then cuts to a bunch of highlights featuring Kaepernick throwing the ball to Beckham. It ends on a ridiculous one-handed catch from Beckham. While the editing makes it tough to seriously evaluate the caliber of Kaepernick\u2019s throws, it does show that he\u2019s been working hard throughout the offseason, and that he\u2019s still pursuing a return to the NFL.\n\nKaepernick last played in the NFL in 2016. During that season, Kaepernick took a knee during the national anthem to protest racial injustice in the United States. No team picked him up during the offseason.\n\nA number of teams have had opportunities to bring Kaepernick in since 2016, but haven\u2019t done it. He\u2019s been passed over for a number of quarterbacks, including Josh Johnson \u2014 who Washington brought in last season after Johnson had been out of the NFL for four years.\n\nUntil a team gives Kaepernick a shot, calls for him will continue every time a starting quarterback gets injured. The offseason workout videos prove that\u2019s something Kaepernick still wants. Some team just has to give him a chance.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nStory continues\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
