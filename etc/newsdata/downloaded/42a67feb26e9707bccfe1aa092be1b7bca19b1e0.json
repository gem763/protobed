AT&T Inc. \u2019s Warner Bros. released the first installment in its two-film adaptation of Stephen King\u2019s classic novel in 2017. \u201cIt\u201d grossed a whopping $123.4 million during its first weekend in theaters, a record for a horror movie.\n\nPicking up decent reviews\u2014but not the raves the first film received\u2014\u201cChapter Two\u201d helps to reinvigorate a box office that heading into the weekend was about 6% behind 2018\u2019s bumper year.\n\nThe new movie picks up 27 years after the first film\u2019s conclusion, when a group of misfit friends\u2014known as the Losers\u2019 Club\u2014make a pact to reunite should the demonic, sewer-dwelling clown Pennywise reappear. The latest installment\u2019s ensemble cast features Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy and Bill Hader.\n\n\u201cChapter Two\u201d now ranks as both the second-highest-grossing opening for a horror film and second-highest debut (after \u201cIt\u201d) for September, traditionally a sluggish month after studios have just finished rolling out their big summer blockbusters.\n\n\u201cChapter Two\u201d also did well overseas, grossing $94 million, according to Box Office Mojo.\n\nThe sequel\u2019s cooler reception from critics may have depressed the box-office tally for \u201cChapter Two\u201d and could hamper its overall performance. The film\u2019s nearly three-hour running time was judged as excessive by many critics.\n\n\u201c \u2018It\u2019 was really lightning in a bottle\u2026we knew we couldn\u2019t duplicate that,\u201d said Jeff Goldstein, Warner Bros.\u2019s head of domestic distribution.\n\nFor Warner Bros., the robust opening is welcome news after a lackluster summer that included only a couple respectable showings\u2014\u201cPok\u00e9mon Detective Pikachu\u201d and \u201cAnnabelle Comes Home\u201d\u2014and one costly misfire in \u201cGodzilla: King of the Monsters.\u201d\n\nShould \u201cChapter Two\u201d build on its successful first weekend, Warner Bros. could finish the year strong with highly anticipated films yet to come. The studio will release \u201cJoker,\u201d starring Joaquin Phoenix, next month, followed in November by \u201cDoctor Sleep,\u201d another adaptation of a King novel, this one a follow-up to \u201cThe Shining.\u201d\n\n\u201cChapter Two\u201d was the only major film opening over the weekend. Holdovers \u201cAngel Has Fallen,\u201d from Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. , and the raunchy comedy \u201cGood Boys,\u201d from Comcast Corp. \u2019s Universal Pictures, placed a distant second and third, respectively.\n\nWrite to R.T.
