Oliver called it a catastrophe that has been \u201cuniversally condemned\u201d before explaining that nearly 180,000 people have since been displaced and 120 civilians have been killed.\n\nTrump later explained that the Kurds didn\u2019t help in the second world war, to which Oliver asked: \u201cWhat the fuck does that have to do with anything?\u201d\n\nHe also used examples of conflicts where the Kurds did help the US before stating: \u201cThe Kurds fought with the US military in at least two more wars than Donald Trump ever fucking did.\u201d\n\nTrump has also since said that he didn\u2019t want to spend more time in Syria, a place of sand and death. \u201cSince when does Trump avoid areas with sand and death? He owns a golf club in Florida,\u201d Oliver quipped. But since May, Trump has increased troops in the Middle East by 14,000.\n\nIt was also revealed that Trump essentially \u201crolled over for Erdo\u011fan\u201d by deciding to withdraw so quickly.\n\n\u201cSo, basically, America left the region the same way you leave a party right after you\u2019ve clogged the toilet: quickly, leaving everything behind and forcing someone else to deal with all the shit,\u201d he said.\n\nSince the withdrawal, \u201cthe consequences have been dire\u201d and more than 100 Isis prisoners have escaped.\n\nAt a rally, Trump said that Turkey\u2019s military incursion into Syria was needed, comparing it to letting two small children fight it out before stepping in. \u201cHe\u2019s not just a shitty president and a shitty person, he\u2019s a shitty dad,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cThank God he never had to raise any children.\u201d\n\nIt has also led to new alliances which could lead to long-term ramifications. \u201cSo Trump has made a snap decision where the big winners are Putin, Erdo\u011fan, Assad and Isis and that is a group you do not want to be friendly with, although I actually believe they were all at a Cowboys game with Ellen this weekend,\u201d he joked. \u201cLook, we\u2019re all different and that\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nWhile Oliver does point out that it\u2019s an impossible situation to get right, \u201cit\u2019s genuinely hard to get it this wrong.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThis was an unforced error. Trump chose to do something this sudden, this impetuous and this damaging and he\u2019s just not going to change.\u201d", "description": "The Last Week Tonight has dissected Trump\u2019s strategy, of lack thereof, for pulling out US troops from the Syrian-Turkish borderJohn Oliver: \u2018So basically, America left the region the same way you leave a party right after you\u2019ve clogged the toilet: quickly, leaving everything behind and forcing someone", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ASLZFXUkbJZLv6NBZb0jaw--~B/aD0zMDA7dz01MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/43946a86165a170ec781823556973ce7", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
