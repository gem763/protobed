He will be remembered as a giant,' said McGraw in a statement.\n\nThe Kid is out of the picture: Robert Evans (above in 2014) passed away on Saturday night at the age of 89\n\nLady loves: The legendary producer was married and divorced seven times, and his ex-wives include Ali McGraw and Catherine Oxenberg(with thjird wife McGraw in 1970 on left, with sixth wife Leslie Ann Woodward in 2003 on right)\n\nAiling: Evans was still visiting with friends over the summer as seen in the photo shared by Nikki Haskell in July\n\nEvans was born Robert Shapera, the son of a dentist and a housewife who was born in New York City.\n\nHe worked on hundreds of radio shows in his youth until a collapsed lung forced him to leave the business.\n\nEvans' first big break in the movie industry came while out west with his brother while the two were trying to sell Charles Evans' sportswear line Evan-Picone to local boutiques.\n\nIt was during this trip that he caught the eye of Norma Shearer while sunning himself poolside at The Beverly Hills Hotel in 1956.\n\nThe actress successfully championed Evans to play the role of her late husband Irving Thalberg in Man of a Thousand Faces.\n\nHe followed that up with a role in The Sun Also Rises, despite leading lady Ava Gardner and author Ernest Hemingway both objecting to his being cast in the film.\n\nTHE SEVEN WIVES OF ROBERT EVANS Sharon Hugueny (m. 1961; div. 1962) Camilla Sparv (m. 1964; div. 1967) Ali MacGraw (m. 1969; div. 1973) Phyllis George (m. 1977; div. 1978) Catherine Oxenberg (m.

And I fell for her. So much so, I forgot it had only been six weeks since I had been hit with a stroke,' said Evans in a statement at the time.\n\n'Between my various film commitments and the physical therapy, it became unrealistic to believe I could simultaneously incorporate a whole new family, home, and lifestyle. That would be terribly unfair to Catherine.'\n\nOxenberg felt the same way at the time.\n\n'As we all know, during a life and death experience, people tend to bond very quickly,' she said in her own statement.\n\n'Both of us acted spontaneously and we regret any confusion we may have caused. At this point, we have reverted to friendship \u2014 being preferable to vows.'\n\nIn 2002, Evans married Leslie Ann Woodward, who got to experience the three-year period during which The Kid Stays in the Picture and How to Lose A Guy in 10 Days were both released to great success and acclaim.\n\nAnd lucky number seven was Lady Victoria White, who filed for divorce after 10 months in 2006 citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nGood god: He was born in New York City but moved to Los Angeles to pursue his dream of acting, finding some success in films including Man of a Thousand Faces ad The Sun Also Rises (l to r: Godfather author Mario Puzo, director Francis Ford Coppolla, and Evans)\n\nMarathon men: Evans turned Paramount around in less than seven years, but eventually left when he grew dissatisfied with his compensation at the studio (Evans and Dustin Hoffman in 1979)\n\nNetworking: Evans received his sole Oscar nomination for the film Chinatown, starring Faye Dunaway (pair above in 1992)\n\nPals: He later turned his eye towards producing, and in 1967 became a production chief at Paramount before taking over at the studio (Evans and Liv Ullman in 1978)\n\nAs good as it gets: During his reign, the studio released The Godfather, Chinatown, The Godfather Part II, Barefoot in the Park, The Odd Couple, Rosemary's Baby, Harold and Maude, Serpico, True Grit, and The Great Gatsby (Evans and Jack Nicholson in 2007)\n\nKids: Marathon Man, Popeye and Urban Cowboy were just a few of the films he produced independently before starting work on the picture that derail his career - The Cotton Club (Evans and Rioman Polanski in an undated photo)\n\nEvans turned Paramount around in less than seven years, but eventually left when he grew dissatisfied with his compensation at the studio.\n\nMarathon Man, Popeye and Urban Cowboy were just a few of the films he produced independently before starting work on the picture that derail his career - The Cotton Club.\n\nThe film would take five years to make and go wildly over budget in the process, costing Evans millions.\n\nThings got even more bizarre when vaudeville performer Roy Radin, who was one of the film's key financial backers, was murdered in a gruesome killing that ended with dynamite being shoved into his dead body and detonated so that police could not identify the victim.\n\nEvans refused to testify at first or be deposed on the advice of his lawyer, Robert Shapiro.\n\nHe was never charged with any crime, but two people interviewed by police did claim that Evans had some involvement in the murder of Radin.\n\nEvans kept a low profile for close to a decade after the drug conviction and murder, and then reemerged with a string of questionable film in the 1990s including Sliver, the Phantom, The Saint and Jade.\n\nThen, another setback when his sex life was revealed in detail after he was identified as one of Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss' clients.\n\nEvans saved the best for last however during that comeback, producing the hit romantic comedy How to lose a Guy in 10 Days.\n\nThe film, released in early 2003, made close to $200 million at the box office worldwide.\n\nOne year prior to that, Evans found himself back in front of the camera with the documentary The Kid Stays in the Picture.\n\nThat title came from the telegram Daryl Zanuck sent when Gardener and Hemingway objected to his casting in The Sun Also Rises.\n\nEvans maintained an office on the Paramount Pictures lot, and continued to develop projects, though none came to fruition in the final two decades of his life.\n\nHe had long planned a movie based on the renegade car builder John DeLorean, written by James Toback to be produced with Brett Ratner.\n\nThere was also a sci-fi film set in a futuristic Manhattan and based on a graphic novel, NYC2123; Whip Smart, the story of a young dominatrix to be directed by Catherine Hardwicke; and a superhero film, Foreverman, based on an original character created by Stan Lee.", "description": "Robert Evans passed away on Saturday night at the age of 89.
