As a comparison, it was worth $1.74bn (\u00a31.35bn) in 2016, the most recent figures available.\n\nThough not all of that money will be spent on Modafinil, it shows the public\u2019s creeping appetite for drug-based brain enhancements.\n\nAside from the medically-approved Modafinil, a vast, often unregulated industry is booming, from podcast superstar Joe Rogan-endorsed Alpha Brain to actress turned wellness expert Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s own Goop-branded Nerd Alert.\n\nAnd the future will see not just the amount of drugs consumed go up but the level of impact they have on the people using them.\n\nAll these drugs fall under the broadly-defined umbrella of \u2018nootropics\u2019 \u2013 a term coined by 1960s Romanian chemist Dr Corneliu Giurgea, when he accidentally discovered apparent memory-enhancing effects of a drug called piracetam.\n\nDr Giurgea\u2019s decree more than 40 years ago that \u2018man is not going to wait passively for millions of years before evolution offers him a better brain\u2019 now seems prophetic.\n\nToday, nootropics spans from simple \u2018natural\u2019 supplements, like caffeine, to obscure \u2018synthetic\u2019 research chemicals tested by enthusiastic hobbyists \u2013 though some experts see less of a separation.\n\nA History of Nootropics Caffeine is the active ingredient in coffee and has been used for hundreds of years to promote wakefulness. While proponents claim it can enhance memory, the medical evidence is inconclusive.\n\nModafinil was used in treatments for narcolepsy since the 1990s. It\u2019s since become widespread for it\u2019s supposed focus-enhancing effects, though there are arguments against its longterm safety.\n\nPiracetam was discovered in the 1960s by Dr. Corneliu Giurgea, who coined the term \u2018nootropics\u2019, after finding the drug helped improved patients\u2019 memory. The medical establishment still isn\u2019t sold, however.\n\nNoopept was developed in Russia in the 1990s based on Piracetam, and is highly popular today in the \u2018biohacking\u2019 community. Thousands of people take it daily, but it was made illegal in 2016 as part of the government\u2019s \u2018legal high\u2019 ban.\n\n\u2018People make this distinction, but a lot of our drugs come from natural sources,\u2019 says Sahakian.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Cocaine is one example. I think this sort of distinction is a false one.\n\n\u2018There are things in the environment, and some of these are synthetic compounds, but what you\u2019re essentially doing is finding what the active compound is, and whatever the natural product might be and enhancing it to some extent.\u2019\n\nWhile natural, so much is still unknown: just how many people are using any of these drugs for a competitive edge? How many more drugs like Modafinil are on the horizon? And how safe are they long-term?\n\nPick-me-ups have always existed.\n\nCoffee beans and Guarana leaves have been consumed for their caffeine for hundreds of years, while amphetamine-based stimulants were consumed en masse on the battlefields of World War II.\n\nBut drugs like these have unwanted side effects; take too much caffeine or amphetamines, and you\u2019ll feel dizzy, nauseous or much worse.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the widespread recognition of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that neural enhancers became more refined.\n\nMethylphenidate (sold as Ritalin) and amphetamine salts (sold as Adderall) production boomed in the US, being prescribed to millions of kids (and inevitably ending up in the hands of not-kids, wanting the attention-focusing effects for non-ADHD reasons).\n\nThese chemicals play with specific neurotransmitters in the brain, improving what\u2019s called cold cognition \u2013 a sort of mental processing independent of your emotions.\n\n\u2018Drugs like Ritalin block reuptake, so they increase the amount of dopamine and noradrenaline that\u2019s around,\u2019 says Prof Sahakian.\n\n\u2018Noradrenaline is very useful for attentional purposes, while dopamine is very useful for what we call executive processes, being involved in motivation.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the rush that some of these neurotransmitters produce also raise the risk of addiction and abuse (millions of ADHD-related drugs are prescribed in the UK each year).\n\nIt\u2019s these downsides that have led to resistance against wide-spread adoption of neurologically-enhancing drugs.\n\nBut Modafinil, which also works on dopamine, has shown the first glimpse that an alternative exists.\n\n\u2018A lot of these drugs are working through similar systems to some extent, but the difference is that Modafinil so far has not been shown to have any abuse potential,\u2019 says Sahakian.\n\nThe task-related motivation boost with no major downsides, previously the stuff of fiction like Bradley Cooper-blockbuster Limitless, appears to be within reach (though only under strictly controlled conditions).\n\nBut could we do better, and will it ever become normalised?\n\n\u2018People are becoming more accepting,\u2019 Sahakian says.\n\n\u2018Before, there used to be more people who thought that healthy people shouldn\u2019t be taking these drugs, but now there seems to be a change.\n\n\u2018A lot of what stops people is the concern about side effects and addiction.\n\n\u2018If you could ensure these side effects and the addictive properties were very low, I think the drug would be very attractive.\u2019\n\nEven with the purported side effects of higher dosages, Modafinil use is remarkably widespread, with almost 1 in 4 Brits having tried it in the past year.\n\nThis could just be the beginning. As we understand more about the specifics of the brain, and the ways in which different areas relate to cognitive tasks, the potential for new drugs increases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We\u2019re getting better and better in studies that we\u2019ve been doing in animals with trying to deliver specifically to different brain areas,\u2019 says Sahakian.\n\nThough not drug-related, one study found that obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms could be reduced by targeting very specific regions in the brain.\n\nThis technique of a machine providing what\u2019s called Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has already shown to increase cognitive abilities in healthy people.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to imagine a future where you could walk into a pharmacy and choose between a single pill or ten minutes on a TMS machine, and walk out markedly smarter.\n\nGiven the apparent lasting effects of TMS, it could even be both: smart drugs for a short term boost and TMS to cement your mental gains, or TMS to nullify the worst side effects of the smart drugs you\u2019re taking.\n\nThere is no scientific consensus on where this ends up: humans taking control of evolution could end up with microchips and/or telepathy being the norm, an increasing number of potions and pills being taken or a reaction back to a more \u2018natural\u2019 way of living.\n\nWhile controversial, acquired savant syndrome \u2013 where some kind of brain damage unlocks some kind of \u2018genius\u2019 ability previously hidden \u2013 has led some researchers to believe that there is so much untapped potential in the brain that is just waiting to get out.\n\nFor now, there are still too many unknowns about the brain for the potential future uses to be clear.\n\nBut smart drugs are already here and the history of human beings and their drug use can give us clues for the rest of us.\n\nThe drugs of an era can often mirror the times people live in.\n\nThe 1960s, with its mind-altering lysergic acid (LSD) echoed the remoulding of politics and protest. The 1980s embodied enormous growth and full-throttle capitalism, so cocaine was a natural choice.\n\nSo what is the drug of the 21st century?\n\n\u2018We\u2019re accelerating into a 24/7 society,\u2019 says Sahakian.\n\n\u2018When people want to take a smart drug and cognitively enhance themselves, it\u2019s usually in the context of what we call cold cognition.\n\n\u2018They want to remember more, they want to do better in the exam, they want to be able to produce better, faster work than their colleagues.\n\n\u2018But nobody really says \u201cI\u2019d like to improve my heart cognition, my emotional and social skills\u201d, which is so important for bringing people together.\u2019\n\nAnd people don\u2019t often realise there\u2019s a cheap, drug-free way of making you smarter: exercise.\n\n\u2018Exercise is a very good means of boosting your brainpower, improving your mood and improving your physical health.\n\n\u2018But people don\u2019t want to put in the time for that sort of thing or don\u2019t enjoy exercise and would just prefer to take a pill.\u2019\n\nThis pill preference is the reality for many\u2014 the pilots, surgeons and professors of the world.\n\nWith ever-increasing pressure from all angles, it\u2019s unlikely the relentless pace of modern life will let up \u2013 leaving space wide open for a vast \u2018smart drug\u2019 business.\n\nIt just depends if the \u2018savant syndrome\u2019 drug can be devised and manufactured safely, if people will move towards implants before scientists ever find the magic pill or if we let natural evolution run its course.\n\nThe smart money is on one of the first two.\n\nThe Future Of Everything This piece is part of Metro.co.uk's series The Future Of Everything.
