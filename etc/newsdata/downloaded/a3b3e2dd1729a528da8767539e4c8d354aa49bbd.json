Warren speak for herself. But this is an issue that we have been working on for my entire political life.\u201d\n\nSanders has long been focused on revamping the tax code to make it more progressive. And while his 2016 presidential bid featured proposals to raise taxes on corporations and the rich, his 2020 campaign includes even more \u2014 and even bigger \u2014 plans.\n\n\u201cSen. Sanders has been talking about income inequality and worker ownership of the economy for quite a long time,\u201d said Neil Sroka, spokesman for Democracy for America, a progressive group that endorsed Sanders in 2016 but hasn\u2019t yet officially backed a 2020 candidate. \u201cWhat these proposals do is put some real concrete meat on the bones on the more value-focused conversations that he\u2019s had.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with ABC News over the weekend, Sanders distinguished himself from Warren by saying that she considers herself to be \u201ca capitalist to her bones\u201d and he doesn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThe reason I am not is because I will not tolerate for one second the kind of greed and corruption and income and wealth inequality and so much suffering that is going on in this country today, which is unnecessary,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocratic strategist Brad Bannon, who is unaffiliated with any presidential campaign, said Sanders appears to be offering policy proposals in an effort to regain some of his 2016 supporters who now back Warren.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s desperately trying to up the ante to bring back the progressives who supported him in 2016.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Sanders released his corporate tax proposal after he had a heart attack earlier this month, prompting concerns about his health, age and ability to run against Trump.\n\nSroka noted that Sanders\u2019s proposal had been in the works for a while but said that the release following the heart attack shows that Sanders is still pushing hard to become the Democratic nominee.\n\n\u201cWhat this does underscore is that the Sanders campaign is firing on all cylinders and working just as hard to win the nomination as it was a couple of weeks ago,\u201d Sroka said. \u201cThey\u2019re not slowing down at all.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s tax proposal was just the latest from Sanders in recent weeks.\n\nLast month he released plans that would create a wealth tax and tax-rate increases for companies with a significant gap between CEO pay and the pay of their median workers.\n\nFrank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness Action Fund, said Sanders is the first 2020 Democratic candidate to offer a comprehensive corporate tax\u2013reform plan.\n\nHe said it\u2019s exciting to see Sanders\u2019s plan because it\u2019s more challenging for candidates to propose corporate tax changes than higher taxes on wealthy individuals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s harder to attack the corporate tax system because you\u2019re attacking the corporate power in Washington, D.C.,\u201d Clemente said.\n\nSanders\u2019s proposals tend to go further than those of other White House hopefuls to hit the rich and corporations.\n\nHis proposed wealth tax would kick in at net worth over $32 million for married couples, compared with the $50 million threshold set by Warren.\n\nAdditionally, Sanders has proposed the highest corporate income tax rate among the crowded field of candidates.\n\nBiden and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas) have each floated a 28 percent rate \u2014 the same level proposed by former President Obama \u2014 while Sen.

She has also proposed a 7 percent surtax on company profits above $100 million.\n\nSanders\u2019s corporate accountability proposal came out just a day before Democratic presidential candidates are expected to highlight their policy plans on the debate stage in Ohio.\n\n\u201cI think you can certainly expect Bernie to continue to raise the urgent issue of corporate greed and corporate power and how he is best qualified to take on that greed and to represent working people in the White House,\u201d Josh Orton, national policy director for the Sanders campaign, told The Hill.\n\nDemocratic candidates across the ideological spectrum have blasted Trump\u2019s tax law and have called for increasing taxes on the rich and corporations, but their tax plans have not been a major focus of the other Democratic presidential debates. Progressive groups are hoping that candidates\u2019 positions on taxes can get more attention on Tuesday.\n\nTax March Executive Director Maura Quint said she\u2019s hopeful that voter interest in plans like the ones put forth will prompt the debate moderators to ask questions about a topic that oftentimes doesn\u2019t generate the same kind of buzz as other political subjects.\n\nQuint said she hopes the moderators see the public\u2019s reaction to Sanders\u2019s plan and \u201cuse that as a cue to actually talk about taxes in-depth in the debates.\u201d", "description": "Sen.
