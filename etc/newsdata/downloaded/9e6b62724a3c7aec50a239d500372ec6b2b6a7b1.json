For her part, Merkel urged China to protect the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents and find a peaceful solution to the unrest.\n\n\u201cPeople should believe that Chinese people have the ability and wisdom to manage its own affairs,\u201d the Chinese premier said, adding that Beijing supported the government to end the violence to \u201csafeguard Hong Kong\u2019s long-term prosperity and stability.\u201d\n\nLi is the highest-level Chinese official to weigh in on the unrest since more than million people took to the streets on June 9 to protest now-withdrawn legislation that would\u2019ve allowed extraditions to the mainland. The peaceful march was the first in a series of demonstrations, which have since escalated in violence and intensity.\n\nMerkel said she supported Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam\u2019s efforts to start a dialogue with the public. She called Lam\u2019s decision Wednesday to withdraw the extradition bill an important signal.\n\n\u201cI indicated that these rights and freedoms must of course be guaranteed,\u201d Merkel said. \u201cIn the current situation, everything must be applied that ensures violence is avoided \u2013 and the solution can only happen peacefully, with dialogue.\u201d\n\nMerkel is seeking to walk a fine line on Hong Kong during her two-day visit to China.
