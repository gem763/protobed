Riot Games\n\nRiot Games, publishers of \"League of Legends,\" is looking to expand its lore.\n\nFor starters, there are some new features coming to the super-popular online video game, which turns 10 this month.\n\nBeyond that, Riot Games announced Tuesday it is working on several other projects including new shooter and strategy games, as well as a trio of new video games set in the \"League of Legends\" universe. The game publisher announced these developments as part of its 10th anniversary livestream Tuesday night.\n\n\"We think that we have got some really cool things to be excited about so we are excited to see people\u2019s reaction,\" said Riot Games co-founder Marc Merrill in an interview with USA TODAY.\n\n'League of Legends': After a decade, online video game remains at the top of its game\n\n'Fortnite': You can play 'Fortnite' again with arrival of 'Chapter 2'\n\nArtwork celebrating the 10th anniversary of 'League of Legends.\" The online video game was launched in October 2009. (Photo: Riot Games)\n\nHe and fellow co-founder Brandon Beck \u2013 who created the company in 2006 and co-created \"League of Legends,\" which launched in 2009 \u2013 stepped away from day-to-day leadership of the company in December 2017 to work on projects beyond the core game.\n\nTheir goal over that nearly two years, he said, was to help \"unlock more value in this company around relating to our culture, and the our future and products and where things are going.\"\n\n'League of Legends' lore\n\nPlayers will see a change to the free-to-play game in coming days. When players kill a dragon on the Summoner's Rift map, the environment \"is going to be even more impacted than previously by one of these elemental rifts for the duration of the match,\" Merrill said. The damage will depend on the type of elemental power attached to the dragon (such as ocean, cloud, etc.)\n\nThis new gameplay feature, Rise of the Elements, hits the game's public beta on Oct. 22 and the live servers on Nov. 20.\n\nArtwork for the online video game 'League of Legends,' which turns 10 in October 2019.

Arriving on the beta Oct. 29 and the live servers Nov. 10, Senna is a character who's origin was touched on five years ago.\n\n\"One of our characters, Lucian, his wife was killed and trapped in this lantern of this demonic undead creature from the Shadow Isles, Thresh,\" Merrill said. \"She is coming back to 'League' and there\u2019s this whole story around her escaping.\"\n\nThese and other gameplay changes \"are meant to really open up the map to fresh new strategies,\" he said.\n\nGoing mobile\n\nA screen shot from \"League of Legends: Wild Rift\" coming next year for mobile and also in the works for video game consoles. The gameplay is similar to the 'League of Legends' PC game. (Photo: Riot Games)\n\n\"Teamfight Tactics,\" an eight-versus-eight strategy game mode already available in the \"League of Legends\" PC game will become playable on mobile devices in the first quarter of 2020. (Players can pre-register now in the Google Play store.)\n\nAlso coming next year is \"League of Legends: Wild Rift,\" a new version of the original game, which is similar to the PC game but built from scratch for mobile and consoles.\n\n\"Legends of Runeterra,\" a free-to-play card game set in the \"League of Legends\" universe, is coming to PC and mobile next year, too. Current characters will be joined by new ones in the strategy card game.\n\nThe game is being created \"with great art and great care and attention to the universe and our lore,\" Merrill said. \"The champions that our players know and love are going to come to life in a different medium in a way that is going to feel incredibly familiar to them.\"\n\n\u201cTime for a true display of skill!\u201d\n\nWho\u2019s ready to take on Runeterra?\n\nFollow @playruneterra and go to https://t.co/SaqkfOqYW1 and pre-register for a chance to play in this preview patch and other upcoming events. pic.twitter.com/eGLhqCyeGM \u2014 League of Legends \ud83e\udd73 (@LeagueOfLegends) October 16, 2019\n\nAnd like \"League of Legends,\" players won't have to break the bank to play, he says. \"The cost of acquiring the decks you want to play is going to be much lower (than other games) and in many cases you don\u2019t have to spend any money at all. You can unlock the cards you want by playing,\" Merrill said.\n\nAlso in development: A fighting game, codenamed \"Project L,\" that features the \"LoL\" characters; \"Project F,\" a game in very early development that will let players explore Runeterra; and a League of Legends Esports Manager game that lets you pick your own \"dream team\" from pro players.\n\nMoving beyond games\n\nThe game publisher has an animated series, \"Arcane,\" coming in 2020. The story follows two \"League of Legends\" champions and is set in two connected cities, Piltover and Zaun.\n\nA new animated series from @RiotGames\n\nEvery legend has a beginning...https://t.co/UQektZxl1y \u2014 League of Legends \ud83e\udd73 (@LeagueOfLegends) October 16, 2019\n\nAnd due next month is \"Realms of Runeterra,\" a hard-cover companion book to the video game that collects its lore, with maps, illustrations.\n\nShooting beyond 'Legends'\n\nA screen shot from Riot Games' 'Project A,' an in-development shooter game due in 2020 for PCs. (Photo: Riot Games)\n\nRiot Games also previewed a new PC shooter game in the works, codenamed \"Project A,\" with more details to come next year. This \"tactical shooter\" has a futuristic Earth setting \u2013 not Runeterra, where \"League of Legends is based.\n\n\"It is a game that is all about very tight gunplay,\" Merrill said. :Accuracy matters. Split-second reactions, milliseconds really matter in this type of game. Super-coordinated team strategies really matter. And the skill curve, kind of like 'League of Legends' is infinite and exponential.\"\n\nAnnouncing \"Project A\", our character-based tactical shooter set in a near-future Earth. pic.twitter.com/wqEXl0Hxbn \u2014 Riot Games (@riotgames) October 16, 2019\n\nRiot Games is not only looking forward to letting players and fans experience these new projects, but also excited to fulfill its development destiny.\n\n\"We are the biggest game company ever to only have one game,\" Merrill said \"We like to joke it\u2019s one in a row. But we are excited where the \u2018s\u2019 in Riot Games will no longer simply be aspirational.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/10/16/league-legends-maker-has-new-online-video-games-works/3987752002/", "description": "Riot Games, publisher of 'League of Legends,\" is expanding that franchise into other media --and is announcing several new games in development.", "authors": ["Mike Snider", "Published A.M.
