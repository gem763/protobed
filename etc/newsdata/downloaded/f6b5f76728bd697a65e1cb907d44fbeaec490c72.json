REUTERS/Vincent Kessler\n\nIn an address in the European Parliament, Juncker said British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had told him on Monday that London still wanted a transition deal, but that he would leave with or without an accord on Oct. 31.\n\nPro-Brexit lawmakers cheered and applauded in the Strasbourg chamber.\n\n\u201cThere is very little time left...The risk of a no-deal is very real,\u201d said Juncker, who met Johnson in Luxembourg on Monday.\n\nIn a worst case scenario, a no-deal Brexit could mean severe disruption to trade, supplies of medicines, fresh foods and a possible rise in public disorder, according to the British government\u2019s contingency plans.\n\nSuch a sharp break in economic ties, ending four decades of EU membership, \u201cmight be the United Kingdom\u2019s choice, but never the choice of the EU,\u201d Juncker said, highlighting how the bloc wants to avoid blame if Britain crashes out.\n\nJuncker said London must present realistic proposals to replace the Irish backstop arrangement in the Britain-EU divorce agreement, which former premier Theresa May agreed with EU leaders but which was rejected by the British parliament.\n\n\u201cI am not emotionally attached to the Irish backstop,\u201d Juncker said. \u201cI have asked the prime minister to make, in writing, alternatives,\u201d he said, calling it a safety net to avoid a divided Ireland after Brexit.\n\nHis pessimistic tone was echoed by Finland\u2019s minister for European affairs, Tytti Tuppurainen, who also spoke in the parliament, saying a no-deal Brexit \u201cis a quite likely outcome.\u201d Finland holds the EU\u2019s rotating presidency.\n\n\u201cSTUPID\u201d BREXIT\n\nHowever, many EU lawmakers warned against a no-deal, both to avoid an economic shock and because they do not want to see Britain abandon its commitments to EU social and environmental standards and become a low-tax, low-regulation rival.\n\n\u201cWe will not accept a Singapore on the North Sea,\u201d said former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt, a liberal EU lawmaker and a member of the parliament\u2019s Brexit committee.\n\nIn at times bad-tempered debate underscoring general weariness on the tortured issue of Britain\u2019s pending departure, senior EU lawmakers took other jabs at the noisy contingent of British euroskeptic deputies in the chamber.\n\nManfred Weber, leader of the center-right EPP group, called Brexit \u201cstupid\u201d, while he and Verhofstadt took aim at British plans for greater sovereignty at a time when the parliament in Westminster has been suspended by Johnson.\n\n\u201cBrexiteers claimed Westminster would take back control, but now they shut it down,\u201d Weber, a German lawmaker, said.\n\nThe European parliament is due to adopt a resolution later on Wednesday calling for Britain to be granted another extension to allow more time for London to agree the terms of its withdrawal.\n\nEU leaders will discuss whether to grant an extension at a two-day summit in Brussels from Oct. 17. Britain\u2019s departure has already been delayed twice since March and Johnson says this will not happen again.\n\nThe EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said that a no-deal Brexit would also not resolve many of the issues around the rights of EU citizens, the Irish border and British obligations under the bloc\u2019s long-term budget.\n\n\u201cIf the United Kingdom leaves without a deal, all these questions will not disappear. They are still there,\u201d Barnier said. \u201cSome three years after the Brexit referendum we should not be pretending to negotiate.\u201d", "description": "An accord to ensure a smooth British exit from the European Union is still possible but the risk of a no-deal is also \"very real\", European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Wednesday, six weeks before Britain is due to leave.", "authors": ["Robin Emmott", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431147053&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0GQ", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
