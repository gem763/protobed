Good news? \u201cThe Secrets We Kept\u201d is one of fall\u2019s big books; and the better news is that it deserves to be.\n\nBought \u2014 at auction \u2014 by the highly-respected Knopf for a reported $2 million, the book\u2019s author, also reportedly, turned down a higher offer from a house she liked less. Now that\u2019s class. Most novelists would like to do that; few actually would.\n\nBut Lara Prescott, whose MFA is from the Michener Center for Writers at the University of Texas at Austin, and who has previously written about animal protection and politics (aren\u2019t they the same?) is made of sterner stuff. Two weeks before her agent set up the auction, she was told by what The New York Times referred to as \u201ca famous older male writer, \u201c\u2018You\u2019re not going to get anything for this. You need to edit it like Hemingway. We can talk about it over beers.\u2019\u201d\n\nWell, beers or no beers, in mid-September, the novel ranked No. 3 on The Times\u2019 bestseller list for fiction. How do you like them apples, Mr. Famous Male Writer?\n\nThe \u201csecrets\u201d of the book\u2019s title are the classified information that passed through the eyes to the fingers of the women in the typing pool of the CIA\u2019s post-Office of Strategic Services (OSS).\n\n\u201cWe typed a hundred words a minute and never missed a syllable. Our identical desks were each equipped with a mint-shelled Royal Quiet Deluxe typewriter, a black Western Electric rotary phone, and a stack of yellow steno pads. Our fingers flew across the keys \u2026\n\n\u201cThe men would arrive around ten. One by one they\u2019d pull us into their offices. We\u2019d sit in small chairs pushed into the corners while they\u2019d sit behind their large mahogany desks or pace the carpet \u2026 Sometimes they\u2019d forget we were there and we\u2019d learn much more \u2026\n\n\u201cThey would call us girls, but we were not. We came to the Agency by way of Radcliffe, Vassar, Smith. We were the first daughters of our families to earn degrees. Some of us spoke Mandarin. Some flew planes. Some could handle a Colt 1873 better than John Wayne. But we were all asked when interviewed, \u2018Can you type?\u2019\u201d\n\nThose lines from the prologue give you the book\u2019s general story, but it\u2019s intertwined with an actual, \u201ctrue fact,\u201d event from CIA files, the agency\u2019s successful attempt to make Russian language editions of Boris Pasternak\u2019s magisterial pro-Western novel \u201cDoctor Zhivago\u201d available in the Motherland where it had been banned \u2014 and Lara, the author\u2019s mistress, sent to the gulag for, in effect, having been his muse.\n\n(No surprise that Ms. Prescott\u2019s first name is Lara; her mother loved the novel.)\n\nAs \u201cThe Secrets We Kept\u201d progresses, we enter the CIA\u2019s post-WWII world at a time when its offices were still in the old State Department building at 21st and C Streets Northwest and \u201ctempos\u201d on the mall (before moving to Langley, Virginia in 1961). The Washington verisimilitude is well done: The old Georgetown Theater on Wisconsin Avenue and the original Old Ebbitt on F, not 15th, Street. Suprise, no mention of a trolley ride out to Great Falls and the famous old amusement park.\n\nNot all the typists came from Ivy League schools. One who didn\u2019t was Irina, probably hired because her mother was born in Russia. Irina\u2019s eventual transformation from typist into U.S. spy is monitored by the lovely and mysterious Sally Forrester, who comes to love her plain-Jane charge, literally. But that\u2019s not central to the story.\n\nMs. Prescott\u2019s fictionalized telling of the story sticks closely to the facts of what the CIA did to get \u201cDr. Zhivago\u201d published in Russian in Russia. (See \u201cThe Zhivago Affair: The Kremlin, The CIA, and the Battle Over a Forbidden Book\u201d by Peter Finn and Petra Couvee.) As for Irina and Sally, chalk that up to the author\u2019s imagination \u2014 I think.\n\nThe characterization and setting are, as said, first rate, but so also are the plotting and its development:\n\n\u201cThe Agency moved fast \u2026 In the time it took winter to thaw, the cherry blossoms to bloom and droop, the dome of Washington\u2019s humidity to descend, \u2018Doctor Zhivago\u2019s Russian proofs were prepped in New York, printed in The Netherlands, and shuttled to a safe house in the back of a wood-paneled station wagon. Three hundred sixty-five copies of the novel had been printed and bound in blue linen covers \u2014 just in time for the World\u2019s Fair, where we\u2019d distribute the banned book to visiting Soviets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Secrets We Kept\u201d is a fine book, well deserving of its out-of-the-box success for all the reasons stated and implied above, but mainly for the undeniable fact that it is a very good story very well told.\n\n\u2022 John Greenya, a Washington writer and critic, is the author of \u201cGorsuch: The Judge Who Speaks For Himself\u201d (Simon and Schuster, 2018).\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nTHE SECRETS WE KEPT\n\nBy Lara Prescott\n\nKnopf, $26.95, 349 pages\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
