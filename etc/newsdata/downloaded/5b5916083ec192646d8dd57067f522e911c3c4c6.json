It should be voted down,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI totally understand the frustration and the fatigue across the country and in this House.\n\n\u201cBut we simply cannot vote for a deal that is even worse than the one this House rejected three times.\u201d", "description": "The Prime Minister spoke at the beginning of an historic Saturday sitting of the House of Commons", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/10/wire-19917506-1571478901-335_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
