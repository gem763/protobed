Taylor pushed Prograis back with counter hooks and thought he had his opponent rocked at the end of the ninth with two short rights.\n\nTaylor celebrates with his new belts and Muhammad Ali trophy (Picture: Reuters)\n\nTaylor could have felt he was ahead in the penultimate round, but continued to push the pace. A clash of heads, though, opened up a cut over the IBF champion\u2019s swollen left eye.\n\nThe cut encouraged Prograis, who came out swinging in the final round. Taylor responded in kind and appeared to be hurt by Prograis\u2019 right hooks, before the bell tolled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrograis shook his head in disappointment when the scorecards were read out, as Taylor also picked up the Muhammad Ali trophy as the winner of the World Boxing Super Series.\n\nMORE: Derek Chisora calls out Joseph Parker after stopping David Price in firefight\n\nMORE: Furious Lee Selby held back by referee from confronting Ricky Burns after late punch", "description": "Josh Taylor is the new unified super-lightweight champion after a thrilling showdown with fellow champion Regis Progrias.", "authors": ["Coral Barry"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_92750661_1572130959.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
