This House cannot any longer keep this country hostage.\u201d\n\nThe idea first came from the Lib Dems, who have enjoyed a boost in the polls since backing a policy to revoke Brexit.

But Corbyn added that a date needed to be locked down in law to prevent Johnson trying to move it for his own advantage and also suggested he would want it to be earlier than 12 December,saying any plan would need to \u201cprotect the voting rights of all of our citizens\u201d.\n\nQuick guide How can Boris Johnson get a general election before January? Show Hide A motion for a general election Boris Johnson has three options to try and call a general election. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, an election may be called if it is agreed by two-thirds of the total number of MPs. Johnson presented motions for an election on 4 and 9 September and failed on both occasions when the majority of Labour MPs abstained. Johnson tried again on 28 October, and failed again. A one-line bill This lowers the threshold of MPs needed to trigger a general election because it requires a simple majority to pass. This could work in Johnson\u2019s favour. However, it is amendable, which can involve the moving of an election date to a time that works for the opposition. A no-confidence motion The leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, can call a no-confidence motion in the prime minister. This needs a simple majority to pass. He has been urged to do this by Johnson several times as a way of triggering an election, but Corbyn has resisted. It begins a 14-day period in which either the prime minister or someone else can try to form a new government. While Johnson could potentially lose this, and therefore his place as prime minister, to another Conservative, Corbyn could also struggle to get enough MPs to rally around him to form a government. The Scottish National party has said it would back him, but the Liberal Democrats have been extremely vocal in saying they would not support him. An election is triggered if, at the end of the two-week period, no alternative government has been formed. Kate Proctor Political correspondent\n\nFor a 9 December election, parliament would need to pass its legislation by Thursday this week, but for a 12 December election it could wait until the middle of next week.\n\nThe government\u2019s argument is that it needs a 12 December date in order to pass Northern Ireland budget legislation before parliament is dissolved for an election.\n\nNo 10 has been split over whether to proceed with the Brexit deal before an election or just push straight for the polls. But Johnson made a firm decision on Monday that ditching the withdrawal bill this parliament was a price worth paying for an election.\n\nHowever, polling experts are divided over whether an election before Brexit will benefit Johnson at all, with the Brexit party expected to exploit his failure to leave on 31 October.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s move for an election came on the day he accepted the EU\u2019s offer of a three-month extension to article 50, bringing a formal end to his pledge for the UK to complete Brexit by 31 October,\u201cdo or die\u201d. The government also finally recognised that this prospect was over by pausing its \u00a3100m advertising campaign, which had stated the UK would leave the EU on that date.\n\nLabour is also split about the wisdom of a poll when Brexit remains unresolved, with some senior shadow cabinet ministers arguing for an election and others for a second referendum first.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats are keen for an election as they are doing well in the polls on the back of their pro-EU position, while the SNP are also expected to gain MPs in Scotland on current predictions.\n\nDid your MP vote for an early general election? Read more\n\nAlthough the Conservatives are ahead, many Tory MPs believe it is a very risky move at a volatile time and have reminded the prime minister how Theresa May lost a strong poll lead over Corbyn in 2017 to finish with a hung parliament.\n\nFormer Tories who had the whip withdrawn over their opposition to a hard Brexit and some pro-deal Labour MPs said they were unhappy with Johnson\u2019s decision to abandon the withdrawal bill.\n\nPhilip Hammond, the former chancellor who had the whip removed, said: \u201cParliament showed last week it wanted to get on with the bill \u2013 it\u2019s the government that hasn\u2019t allowed us to do so. So stop the self-indulgent focus on elections on both sides and concentrate on passing the bill. If we\u2019d done that last week, we could have finished it by now.\u201d\n\nSarah Champion, a Labour MP who voted for Johnson\u2019s deal at second reading, added: \u201cI\u2019ve always said Boris doesn\u2019t care about Brexit, just increasing his majority and staying as PM. He had a majority to get a Brexit deal and he\u2019s thrown it away in his quest for a general election.\u201d", "description": "PM in bid to get Lib Dems and SNP to agree poll date before Christmas", "authors": ["Rowena Mason", "John Crace"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b239de9d04982e1b48eb4641369de4249430762c/0_126_3708_2225/master/3708.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=32eebe65c0ebcd957d5ca2088131d0a1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
