Some of those starts came with other teams.\n\nThe bench included backup first baseman Matt Adams, reserve second basemen Brian Dozier and Asdrubal Cabrera, catcher Yan Gomes and outfielders Michael A. Taylor and Gerardo \u201cBaby Shark\u201d Parra.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all about the team,\u201d manager Dave Martinez told The Washington Times before Game 3. \u201cThey really are. You listen to these guys pulling for each other day in and day out, they\u2019ve done that all year. When they\u2019re called upon, they\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\nThat includes Adams, who pinch hit Saturday to start a rally as Nationals won 3-1 to take 2-0 lead in St. Louis.\n\n\u201c(Adams) hasn\u2019t really played much or done much, but he gets it, and he went in there and had a big hit for us.\u201d Martinez said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
