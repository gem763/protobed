That fits a pattern policymakers have come to expect from Trump\u2019s play-it-by-ear White House: With qualified Republican candidates increasingly unwilling to dirty their hands in Trump\u2019s collapsing administration, the White House is stuck recycling the same third-string names into different roles.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump\u2019s staffing decisions often run intentionally foul of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, which requires acting cabinet-level officers to be next in line for the job \u2014 or at least confirmed by the Senate. If those are too difficult for the White House, there is a third, even easier option: The proposed acting director must have served at least 90 days under the secretary he or she is replacing.\n\nCuccinelli and Morgan don\u2019t even satisfy the bare minimum required by the law. But as Americans have learned over the past three years, the Trump administration has no qualms about shredding legal protocol to place politically valuable allies in powerful government roles. The result is a White House devoid of policy seriousness, led by a small clique of sycophants unwilling or unable to stand up to Trump\u2019s unrealistic proposals and policy excesses.\n\nThe staffing crisis in the White House isn\u2019t new: the Interior Department drew criticism from government ethics watchdogs and legal scholars for openly flouting the Federal Vacancies Reform Act by holding open jobs Trump sought to minimize. The calculus is intentional: Instead of governing, Trump is content to starve troublesome government departments of resources and leadership until they are functionally unable to perform their duties.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s record 80 percent senior-level turnover rate has created one of the emptiest executive branches in American history, with more vacant and acting directors than at any time prior. That\u2019s great if you\u2019re a president interested in acting with unchecked authority. It\u2019s bad for the rest of us.\n\nCuccinelli and Morgan landed their jobs after receiving praise from current Trump administration insiders. That elite group has dwindled in recent months to include Trump family members and key campaign-era hangers-on like Kellyanne Conway Kellyanne Elizabeth ConwayTrump has floated Mnuchin, Conway for White House chief of staff: report Trump embarks on Twitter spree amid impeachment inquiry, Syria outrage The Hill's Campaign Report: Biden camp faces new challenges MORE, Stephen Miller Stephen MillerThe Memo: Drip, drip of revelations damages Trump Trump says acting Homeland Security chief McAleenan will step down Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Coalition Against Surprise Medical Billing \u2014 Judge blocks Trump 'public charge' rule | Appeals court skeptical of Trump arguments for Medicaid work requirements | CDC offers guidance for treating vaping-related cases MORE and Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner Jared Corey KushnerMnuchin to attend Saudi economic forum one year after Khashoggi death Career State official warned about Biden's son: report Buttigieg knocks Trump as a 'walking conflict of interest' MORE, Ivanka Trump Ivana (Ivanka) Marie TrumpPompeo expected to visit Kansas on Thursday Career State official warned about Biden's son: report Trump speaks with NASA astronauts on all-female spacewalk MORE and Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiOvernight Defense: Trump's Syria envoy wasn't consulted on withdrawal | McConnell offers resolution urging Trump to rethink Syria | Diplomat says Ukraine aid was tied to political investigations Democrats say they have game changer on impeachment READ: Diplomat describes pressure put on Ukraine to open 'investigations' MORE. Their positions owe much to loyalty and little to competence, as recent unforced errors from the West Wing have shown.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nKushner may be the most egregious example of a White House willing to skirt ethics and the law to keep power within Trump\u2019s inner-circle. Kushner boasts a slew of amorphous, semi-official international roles including de facto ambassador to Saudi Arabia, lead negotiator for Trump\u2019s Israel-Palestine peace plan, lead author of White House on immigration policy, policy lead for criminal justice reform and Trump\u2019s personal go-between to congressional Republicans.\n\nMeanwhile, Kushner\u2019s wife and presidential first daughter Ivanka Trump has largely replaced the State Department as a goodwill ambassador and negotiator, most prominently at last month\u2019s United Nations General Assembly. Ivanka\u2019s role in international relations has grown even as she continues to build a lucrative branding empire in countries with official business before the United States \u2014 and, by extension, before Ivanka and Jared Kushner.\n\nThings aren\u2019t working out as Trump hoped. Instead of creating a lean, easily-influenced coterie of senior insiders, Trump\u2019s neglect of senior positions has created unprecedented stagnation in major departments and agencies. It also leads to Republican brain-drain as skilled conservative public servants avoid tainting their professional credibility by associating with Trump\u2019s contaminated West Wing.\n\nFar from granting Trump more authority to do as he pleases, the legal restrictions placed on his acting senior staffers further limit his ability to execute policy. Given recent proposals included an alligator-filled border moat, policy paralysis may be the best outcome for America.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean legislators on Capitol Hill should accept the status quo. Trump\u2019s (in)actions lay bare the shortcomings of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998. Adding teeth to the weak and easily-subverted Vacancies Reform Act should be a top priority not only for Democrats, but also for Republican lawmakers who value effective, ethical government.\n\nIf not, we could always try the alligators.\n\nMax Burns is a veteran Democratic strategist and senior contributor at Millennial Politics.
