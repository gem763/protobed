Tanzilya is believed to have lived through the rule of Nicholas II, Kerensky, Lenin, Stalin, Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Andropov, Chernenko, Gorbachev, Yeltsin, Putin, and Medvedev\n\nShe did not smoke and ate only natural foods, and endured many decades of work for which Tanzilya received a labour award.\n\n'She was working all the time in the fields,' said one account.\n\n'My mother has seen a lot during her long life. She has lived from Rasputin to Putin,' said Shintas, her son, now in his 70s, several years ago.\n\nGrigory Rasputin was the 'crazed monk' who held the Russian royal family in his thrall, arguably speeding the demise of the Romanov dynasty, while President Vladimir Putin is one of a dozen Kremlin rulers during her lifetime.\n\nTanzilya said her old age was down to 'optimism and hard work' - along with drinking kefir, or fermented milk. She endured many decades of work for which Tanzilya received a labour award (pictured)\n\nOfficials say her birth certificate and internal Russian passport indicated her great age, but sceptics point to this making her 53 when she first gave birth, and 59 when her third son was born.\n\nIn all Tanzilya had three sons, ten grandchildren, 25 great-grandchildren and two great-great-grandchildren, say reports.\n\nAn ethnic Kazakh and a Muslim, she was born as the eldest of eight and raised her siblings, marrying after the revolution when she worked as a labourer on a Soviet collective farm.\n\nShe had three sons, ten grandchildren, 25 great-grandchildren in her life and two great-great grandchildren throughout her life\n\nShe had no children before her first husband went missing during the Second World War.\n\nYet she found happiness during Stalin's final decade in power, say her family, after marrying Musagali Bisembeev, 16 years her senior.\n\nSon Shintas said: 'My mother met my father in 1946.\n\n'She was 50 and he was over 60 but he was a strong man, he worked at the collective farm and did as much as two men would do.\n\n'After the war my parents lived in a soldier's shelter and their first son died in his babyhood.\n\nTanzilya had no children before her first husband went missing during the Second World War and went on to marry Musagali Bisembeev, 16 years her senior, in 1946\n\n'They were so poor that could not afford a proper house, and probably this is why their baby son died.You could not heat such room properly.\n\n'But later they had three more sons, just think about it.\n\n'I was born when my mother was 53 and the youngest brother was born when she was 59. It still sounds incredible.\n\nThe woman's family have said her longevity was down to her 'never sitting still' and a 'healthy lifestyle'.\n\n'Life was not easy and they were often hungry then.\n\n'I still remember being five years old and already helping my parents with the hay.'\n\nDespite being Russia's oldest citizen, she hardly spoke the language, preferring her native Kazakh tongue.\n\nNeighbour Valentina Akbasova said three years ago: 'She is so gentle. She will always hug you and kiss and ask how you feel, she was always eager to help.'\n\nTanzilya is believed to have lived through the rule of Nicholas II, Kerensky, Lenin, Stalin, Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Andropov, Chernenko, Gorbachev, Yeltsin, Putin, and Medvedev (succeeded by Putin again in 2012).\n\nNeighbours have described the 123-year-old (pictured) as gentle and 'always eager to help'. It has been claimed that the whole village came to see her depart on her last journey' at the family cemetery\n\nTwo other Russian women Koku Istambulova, purportedly 129, and Nanu Shaova, listed as 128, both died earlier this year.\n\nA problem with recognising such claims is the lack of original documentation of their births partly due to the turmoil of revolution and war in Russia.\n\nThe oldest documented human lifespan is Jeanne Calment, from France, who lived 122 years, 164 days, dying in 1997.\n\nAs a girl she met Vincent van Gogh.\n\nIn March this year Kane Tanaka from Fukuoka, Japan, was officially confirmed as the oldest verified living person at 116 years.", "description": "Tanzilya Bisembeyeva, who lived in Russia, has died aged 123.
