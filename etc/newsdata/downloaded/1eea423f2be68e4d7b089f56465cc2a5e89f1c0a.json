In 2017, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were awarded \u00a392,000 (100,000 euros) in damages after French magazine Closer printed topless pictures of the duchess in 2012.\n\nA French court ruled the images had been an invasion of the couple's privacy.\n\n'Lie after lie'\n\nThe new legal proceedings are being funded privately by the couple and any proceeds will be donated to an anti-bullying charity.\n\nIn his statement, Prince Harry said he and Meghan believed in \"media freedom and objective, truthful reporting\" as a \"cornerstone of democracy\".\n\nBut he said his wife had become \"one of the latest victims of a British tabloid press that wages campaigns against individuals with no thought to the consequences - a ruthless campaign that has escalated over the past year, throughout her pregnancy and while raising our newborn son\".\n\nPrince Harry said: \"There is a human cost to this relentless propaganda, specifically when it is knowingly false and malicious, and though we have continued to put on a brave face - as so many of you can relate to - I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been.\"\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Earlier on in their tour of Africa, the couple introduced baby son Archie to Archbishop Desmond Tutu\n\nHe said \"positive\" coverage of the couple's current tour of Africa had exposed the \"double standards\" of \"this specific press pack that has vilified her almost daily for the past nine months\".\n\n\"They have been able to create lie after lie at her expense simply because she has not been visible while on maternity leave,\" he said.\n\n\"She is the same woman she was a year ago on our wedding day, just as she is the same woman you've seen on this Africa tour.\"\n\n'It is bullying'\n\nThe duke said he had been a \"silent witness to her private suffering for too long\".\n\n\"To stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in,\" he said.\n\nHe accused the paper of misleading readers when it published the private letter, by strategically omitting paragraphs, sentences and specific words \"to mask the lies they had perpetrated for over a year\".\n\n\"Put simply, it is bullying, which scares and silences people. We all know this isn't acceptable, at any level,\" he said.\n\n\"We won't and can't believe in a world where there is no accountability for this.\"\n\nThe Mail on Sunday spokesperson said: \"We categorically deny that the duchess's letter was edited in any way that changed its meaning.\"", "description": "The Duke of Sussex says he fears his wife is \"falling victim\" to press intrusion as his mother did.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/125C5/production/_109050257_3b15b7a6-9b15-459f-bd5f-39914b9ae3e7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
