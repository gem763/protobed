Read more\n\n\u201cThe decision was made keeping in mind the impact that e-cigarettes have on the youth of today,\u201d India\u2019s finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, told reporters in the capital, New Delhi.\n\nE-cigarettes heat up a liquid \u2013 tasting of anything from bourbon to bubble gum or just tobacco, and which usually contains nicotine \u2013 into vapour, which is inhaled.\n\nThe vapour does not contain the estimated 7,000 chemicals present in tobacco smoke but does contain a number of substances that could potentially be harmful. They have been pushed by producers, and also by some governments, including in Europe, as a safer alternative to cigarette smoking \u2013 and as a way to kick the habit.\n\nPublic Health England and most, but not all, of the public health community in the UK say it is not dangerous. PHE is on record as saying it is 95% safer than smoking \u2013 which kills half of all of those who take up the habit. UK scientists and campaigners are focused on e-cigarettes as a way for adults to quit smoking.\n\nHowever, critics say that apart from being potentially harmful in themselves, the flavours of some liquids have turned millions of children into vapers \u2013 and potential future smokers.\n\nUK attacked for defence of flavoured e-cigarettes Read more\n\nThe emergency legislation in New York, the second US state to ban flavoured e-cigarettes, followed a mysterious outbreak of severe pulmonary disease that has killed seven people and left hundreds unwell.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s administration announced last week it would soon ban flavoured e-cigarette products to stem a rising tide of youth users.\n\nCalifornia launches $20m campaign to deter e-cigarettes amid spike in illnesses Read more\n\nLegislation is also being tightened elsewhere, and in Singapore e-cigarettes are already outlawed. In Japan, vaping and alternatives such as \u201cheat not burn\u201d tobacco vaporisers are allowed but e-juices with nicotine are not.\n\nChina, home to almost a third of the world\u2019s smokers, indicated in July that it wanted the \u201csupervision of electronic cigarettes\u201d to be \u201cseverely strengthened\u201d.\n\nThe Indian ban covers the production, manufacture, import, export, transport, sale, distribution, storage of e-cigarettes, as well as advertisements.\n\nThe government said it would advance tobacco control efforts and contribute to a reduction in tobacco usage. Punishments include up to a year in prison.\n\nAlthough few Indians vape at present, the Indian ban also cuts off a vast potential market of 1.3 billion consumers for makers of e-cigarettes.\n\nThe global tobacco industry has been investing heavily in the technology to compensate for falling demand for cigarettes due to high taxes and smoking bans, particularly in the west.\n\nIn 2018, Altria, the US maker of Marlboro and Chesterfield, splashed out almost $13bn on a stake in one of the biggest e-cigarette makers, Juul.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, India is the world\u2019s second-largest consumer of traditional tobacco products, which are not covered by the new ban, killing nearly 900,000 people every year.\n\nThirty-five per cent of adults are users, although chewing tobacco \u2013 which can also come in flavours such as chocolate and which also causes cancer \u2013 is more prevalent than smoking.\n\nIndia is also the world\u2019s third-largest producer of tobacco, the WHO says, and tobacco farmers are an important vote bank for political parties.\n\nAccording to the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry, an estimated 45.7 million people depend on the tobacco sector in India for their livelihood. India also exports around $1bn-worth of tobacco annually, and the government holds stakes in tobacco firms including ITC, one of India\u2019s biggest companies.\n\n\u201cI feel it\u2019s absolutely absurd,\u201d Aronjoy, 22, a student and occasional vaper, told AFP in a shop selling e-cigarettes. \u201cThe government believes from my perspective that it\u2019s all right to smoke cigarettes \u2026 which is much more injurious for our health that vaping would be.\u201d\n\nThe Association of Vapers India said the government\u2019s move \u201cindicates it is more concerned about protecting the cigarette industry than improving public health\u201d.", "description": "Ban follows vaping-related deaths in US, with punishment including up to a year in prison", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed13eff905f6eba620ba4d3464b456076ce3dc84/0_0_2975_1785/master/2975.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7c3444e96fba08ca91f6f0c5cc86deba", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
