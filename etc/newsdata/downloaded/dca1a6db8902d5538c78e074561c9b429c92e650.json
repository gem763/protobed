Coming soon you'll see a \"Breaking Bad\" movie, Netflix's \"El Camino\" (which the streaming giant will be releasing theatrically), and movie versions of \"The Walking Dead\" and \"The Sopranos\" (the prequel \"The Many Saints of Newark\"). Everyone involved just hopes they get the success Focus is seeing with \"Downton Abbey\" and not a dud Warner Bros. had when it made the HBO show \"Entourage\" into a movie. That opened in fourth place the weekend it was released in 2015 and ended up with a lifetime gross of just $49.2 million worldwide.\n\nRead more: Morgan Spurlock talks about his sexual misconduct confession, getting sober, and releasing \"Super Size Me 2\"\n\n\"Downton Abbey\" beat out a lot of competition to take the top spot. Along with popular holdovers like Warner Bros.' \"It Chapter 2,\" and STXfilms' \"Hustlers,\" there were new releases like Disney/Fox's \"Ad Astra,\" starring Brad Pitt, and Lionsgate's \"Rambo: Last Blood.\"\n\nOut of that group, \"Ad Astra\" took the second place slot this weekend with $19.2 million (20% of which came from Imax screens). A good start for a movie Disney is hoping will gain traction as we go deeper into award season.\n\nIn third place was \"Rambo: Last Blood\" with $19 million. Fourth place was \"It Chapter 2\" with $17.2 million. And in fifth place was \"Hustlers\" with $17 million.", "description": "The big screen version of the popular TV show had the biggest opening ever for Focus Features with $31 million.", "authors": ["Jason Guerrasio"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8758b62e22af0048502933-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
