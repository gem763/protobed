What has gone on here?\"\n\nBoparan, heir to a \u00a3800 million chicken fortune, was just 19 at the time of the horrific crash.\n\nMr Edwards, who is a builder, called him \"a privileged little boy\".\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nHe added: \"I never though I'd live to see the day where the British justice system aired on the side of a child killer.\n\n\"He has effectively gotten away with killing my daughter. Nobody even told me he had been freed.\n\n\"It has been four years this month since Cerys died and it doesn't get any easier.\n\n\"It has ruined my life, I lost my marriage and my home and he gets 13 months for killing a little girl - its a disgrace.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nCerys had dozens of operations after the crash.\n\nShe was paralysed and a post mortem revealed the youngster had died as a result of injuries sustained in the collision.\n\nThe little girl was awarded \u00a35million compensation in 2012, along with a guaranteed annual payout of \u00a3450,000 to help pay for her annual care bill.\n\n(Image: Nick Wilkinson)\n\nAt the time Judge Martin McKenna, sitting at Birmingham County Court, described it as the \"saddest and most tragic case\" he had ever come across.\n\nBut Mr Edwards continued: \"The legal system has sided with the perpetrator rather than the victim and that is the biggest travesty of justice.\n\n\"We unsuccessfully appealed to the Attorney General when he was jailed so now its just time to try and move on.\n\n\"That is what Cerys would have wanted as she idolised me, so that is what I am going to try and do from now.\"", "description": "Gareth Edwards, the grief-stricken dad of tragic Cerys Edwards, from Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, branded the decision a \"joke\" and a \"disgrace\"", "authors": ["Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Daily Mirror", "Tristan Potter", "Swns", "Pa", "Nick Wilkinson"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20757599.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Cerys-Edwards-parents-win-fight-on-dangerous-driving-law.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
