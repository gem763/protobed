Offering up a 35-minute art film for the price of an IMAX ticket is the kind of approach that does a pretty good job of separating the hardcore fans from the merely curious. At the nearly sold-out 7 p.m. screening at Lincoln Square AMC last night (home to the only true IMAX screen in New York City, accept no substitutes), the audience looked to be made up mostly of admirers, with a light but not inconsiderable scattering of journalists. Anyone who\u2019s stuck with West over the wild highs and lows of his tumultuous career has had to cultivate a kind of superhuman patience, and this latest output cycle is no different. Jesus Is King is meant to be a companion piece to the album of the same name, one that blew through three announced release dates and only just made its arrival this afternoon.\n\nThat\u2019s good news for the movie, which isn\u2019t the kind of thing that benefited from being put out into the world solo \u2014 it\u2019s an experimental effort that feels too ethereal to bear up under much solo scrutiny. The Jesus Is King movie isn\u2019t anything like Runaway, the 2010 short that West directed and starred in himself, and released ahead of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. Jesus Is King offers little by way of narrative at all, existing in a space somewhere between that of visual album and concert doc. West has handed the directorial reins over to Nick Knight, who helmed the videos for \u201cBound 2\u201d and \u201cBlack Skinhead,\u201d but the authorship of the project is clearly still all Kanye\u2019s \u2014 a mix of ecstatic spirituality and artistic wankery. More than anything else, the film feels like a frustrated attempt at conveying a concentrated version of its born-again creator\u2019s experiences, before he pulls away and turns with a degree of relief back to the topic he\u2019s always been more comfortable with \u2014 himself.\n\nJesus Is King was shot in the Roden Crater, an ongoing, unfinished land art installation on the edge of the Painted Desert that\u2019s never been open to the public, and that James Turrell has been working on since the late \u201970s. It\u2019s a spectacular setting, even if the film quickly reveals itself to be overly enamored with the landform\u2019s shape \u2014 Jesus Is King starts off with a drone shot that slowly pulls away from its round structure from above, and then uses circles as the central visual motif, and frame shape, for most of the remaining runtime. Circles within circles, even, once it heads into the structure, where it stays. The main space, the Crater\u2019s Eye, is a round room with a round cutout in the middle of the ceiling offering a domelike view of the bright Arizona sky. It\u2019s a place that has the atmosphere of a cathedral without actually being one, which is ideal for a movie that wants to summon the feeling of church \u2014 down to periodic Bible verses appearing on screen \u2014 without the structure of it.\n\nWhen the Sunday Service choir \u2014 the group West assembled for the weekly pseudo-religious performances he\u2019s been leading all year \u2014 files onto the screen in matching costumes, they sing the words \u201cJesus is king\u201d to the tune of Carl Orff\u2019s \u201cO Fortuna,\u201d that go-to music cue for whenever shit\u2019s going down in a movie. It\u2019s goofy as hell, but it\u2019s a little goosebump-inducing, too, when the choir members pause between phrases to let their harmonies reverberate off the walls of the room. The film freely mixes a few tracks from the new album with older material off The Life of Pablo and 808s & Heartbreak, and all of that with gospel songs and hymns. It focuses at first on the choir, sometimes from unexpected angles \u2014 one singer gets a direct, prolonged close-up, which is an awfully intense thing to do to a person in IMAX, the circular framing making her look like a massive Twitter avatar. The members reach to the heavens and kneel as if in prayer as they perform, but as much as Jesus Is King tries to borrow their devotional exuberance \u2014 shooting the choir director from below so that his energetic conducting is framed against the sky \u2014 it also feels outside of it. The film is never more vivid than when most of them depart the frame.\n\nThat\u2019s when West, who over the course of Jesus Is King goes from member of the group to soloist, makes his way into a sequence that\u2019s staged like the aftermath of a show, and offers a spare, haunting rendition of \u201cStreet Lights,\u201d accompanied on piano and organ, that\u2019s easily the highlight of the whole affair. The sequence after that is even more intimate \u2014 a shot of Psalm West cradled against his father\u2019s chest as he sings an a capella version of his new track \u201cUse This Gospel.\u201d It\u2019s there, at its more minimal, where Jesus Is King ends. And if that\u2019s abrupt, well, nothing about the film is especially coherent, including its simultaneous status as a piece of art, a gesture of religious conviction, and a shameless act of commerce. It feels like notes from an artist who\u2019s not sure if he wants to express himself as a worshiper or an object of worship \u2014 but who\u2019s prepared to give it a try anyhow, on the biggest screen possible.", "description": "Jesus Is King finds Kanye West heading to the Arizona desert for an arty concert documentary to accompany the new album, featuring performances from Sunday Service, the choir group with which he\u2019s been giving pseudo-religious weekly performances.", "authors": ["Alison Willmore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/25/kanye-west/kanye-west-jesus-is-king-bts-01.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
