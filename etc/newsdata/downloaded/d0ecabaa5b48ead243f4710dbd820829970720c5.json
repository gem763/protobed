(Image: Universal Music Group)\n\nAriana Grande, Miley Cyrus, and Lana Del Rey are talented performers who, despite their fondness for cultural appropriation, have all cranked out more than their fair share of legitimately fantastic music. \u201cDon\u2019t Call Me Angel,\u201d the new single tied to Elizabeth Banks\u2019 upcoming Charlie\u2019s Angels, is not a particularly bright spot on any of their discographies.\n\nThe concepts behind both the song itself and the accompanying music video directed by Hannah Lux Davis are fairly straightforward and on-brand: Three women with different styles and personalities come together to form a super team of deadly spies who get shit done and have fun while they\u2019re doing it.\n\nIt\u2019s the pure essence of Charlie\u2019s Angels, and you\u2019d think that between the three singers, and the team of writers and producers who also crafted the song, \u201cDon\u2019t Call Me Angel\u201d would end up being the sort of late-summer bop that would get you hyped up to see the film when it hits theatres later this fall.\n\nI Spy At Least One Dance Number In The Charlie's Angels Trailer Don\u2019t call them angels: Call them Charlie\u2019s Angels. The first trailer is here for Elizabeth Banks\u2019 Charlie\u2019s Angels, which brings Kristen Stewart and Ella Balinska to the rescue for a scientist-turned-whistleblower (Naomi Scott) trying to save the world from catastrophe. Read more\n\nAnd yet... both the song and the music video are disorienting messes that are surprising because you know everyone involved here is capable of much, much more. Lyrically, \u201cDon\u2019t Call Me Angel\u201d is an exploration of its title\u2019s declaration: All of the women are being watched by people who find them fascinating, but they\u2019re not interested in being objectified. There\u2019s nothing wrong with a simple, strong idea like that, but as each of the singers steps up to the mic for her individual verse, you get the sense that no one got everyone together to talk about making the vocals work together as discrete pieces of a musical song.\n\nGrande, Cyrus, and Del Rey are all drastically different kinds of singers and the frenetic pop-y beat bouncing beneath \u201cDon\u2019t Call Me Angel\u201d does little in the way of giving them much of a chance to blend their styles in an interesting way. At times, it seems as if you\u2019re listening to three different demos strung together, which is made all the weirder because the music video is trying to use the music to help tell its own specific Charlie\u2019s Angels narrative. The video follows each singer on different Townsend missions that showcase their unique approaches to espionage.\n\nAriana\u2019s quite good with walkie-talkies and ordering in helicopters. Miley will fight you with her fists and bite you while wearing too many gold chains. Lana, the chillest-seeming of the group, spends a lot of her time luxuriating and petting her vast collection of weapons that she\u2019s presumably very good at murdering people with. They might not be the trio from the film, but they are a group of Charlie\u2019s Angels, and it\u2019s hard to believe that any of them have ever successfully pulled off a mission.\n\nProductions like this that are connected to major movies are a tricky. When they\u2019re good, they\u2019re good, and the movie\u2019s got a little bright spot attached to it that may or may not have any bearing on the plot. But when they\u2019re bad, that has the odd effect of making the movie seem iffy by association. The music video establishes that Ariana, Miley, and Lana are hanging out at the Townsend Agency, but the story that\u2019s being presented doesn\u2019t have much to say about what kind of agents they are or what you\u2019re exactly supposed to get out of the music video.\n\nObviously, this year\u2019s Charlies Angels will be a different movie than McG\u2019s 2000 cult classic, but you can\u2019t help but notice that both films were rolled out with big, buzzy song/video combinations headlined by stars. It isn\u2019t exactly fair to compare any trio of individual singers to Destiny\u2019s Child\u2014an established group known for their epic harmonies. But the entire premise of \u201cDon\u2019t Call Me Angel\u201d wouldn\u2019t really be possible if Beyonc\u00e9, Kelly, and Michelle didn\u2019t run the \u201cCharlie\u2019s Angels Boot Camp\u201d in the \u201cIndependent Women Pt. 1\u201d video.\n\nBeyond the literal references to the actors performing in Charlie\u2019s Angels, what \u201cIndependent Women Pt. 1\u201d captured both as a video and as a song is that while all of the Angels can and often do operate individually, they all understand how and when to work together in order to accomplish their goals. There\u2019s no reason that the women of \u201cDon\u2019t Call Me Angel\u201d couldn\u2019t be presented as a coordinated outfit of trained spies, but the video only reinforces the song\u2019s underlying suggestion that they\u2019re all out of sync with one another.\n\nIf \u201cDon\u2019t Call Me Angel\u201d existed in a vacuum independent from the actual world Charlie\u2019s Angels exists in, that\u2019d be one thing. But the fact that Elizabeth Banks makes a cameo at the very end of the video as an actual Bosley who\u2019s apparently in charge of this squad means that they\u2019re an actual in-universe team, and from the looks of it, they might not be the kinds of spies you\u2019d want saving your arse.\n\nCharlie\u2019s Angels hits theatres November 14.", "description": "Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus, and Lana Del Rey are talented performers who, despite their fondness for cultural appropriation, have all cranked out more than their fair share of legitimately fantastic music. \u201cDon\u2019t Call Me Angel,\u201d the new single tied to Elizabeth Banks\u2019 upcoming Charlie\u2019s Angels, is not a...", "authors": ["Chris Jager", "Catie Keck"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/wlxsn4dtep8hnss4uovz.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
