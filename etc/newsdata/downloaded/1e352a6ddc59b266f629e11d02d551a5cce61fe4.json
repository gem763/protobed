His seemingly unshakable base.", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Impeaching a U.S. president might not be the be-all-end-all for their career. We explain why this is the case. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nStory Highlights In USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll, Americans split 46%-47% over whether Trump should be removed from office.\n\nCore supporters: 40% agree that the president is the victim of a \"lynching.\"\n\nHis political foundation energizes Trump and helps limit GOP defections.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Even as support for his impeachment grows, President Donald Trump continues to be backed by a seemingly unshakable core of supporters who deny he has done anything wrong and agree that he is the target of a political \"lynching,\" a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll finds.\n\nAmericans are split in the survey about whether Trump should be convicted by the Senate in an impeachment trial and removed from office: 46% in favor and 47% against. Having close to half of registered voters support his eviction from the White House is politically perilous territory for any president, of course.\n\nDespite damaging new testimony, however, 30% to 40% of those surveyed remain solidly on Trump\u2019s side. That is a significant asset for the president as the House of Representatives prepares to vote Thursday to affirm the formal impeachment investigation.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s look at the economy, wages, unemployment, foreign affairs, tariffs and other things like that,\u201d said Steven Kay, 67, of Riverside County, California, a retiree and a Republican who was among those surveyed. \u201cHis rhetoric might be a little much, but he is making good policy.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton and impeachment: How is she connected to inquiries against three presidents?\n\nPresident Donald Trump (Photo: Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nWilliam Skelskey, 84, a Republican and retired real-estate agent from Mission Viejo, California, blamed Democrats' \"negativity\" for Trump's troubles and called him \"one of the top three presidents since Washington and Reagan.\"\n\nThe president\u2019s solid core of supporters don\u2019t comprise a majority of the electorate, but they do provide a political foundation that energizes him \u2013 witness his speeches that stretch an hour and longer at raucous rallies \u2013 and helps limit defections from other GOP officials.\n\nPaleologos on the Poll: On Trump impeachment, watch the voters who haven't made up their minds\n\nControversy over Ukraine call\n\nIn the poll, nearly four in 10 say his phone call pressuring the Ukrainian president to meddle in U.S. politics is itself an impeachable offense. But another 31% say there was nothing wrong with the conversation, echoing Trump\u2019s insistence that it was \"perfect.\" Thirty-seven percent say the House should stop investigating the president and his administration entirely.\n\n\u201cIt seems like the inquiry is a tremendous waste of time and money,\u201d said George Roma, 55, a small business owner from central Florida and a Republican. \u201cI\u2019m baffled why they continue to do this for three years.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at a U.N. meeting in New York on Sept. 25, 2019. (Photo: Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIn contrast, some of Trump\u2019s critics are baffled why he hasn\u2019t been impeached already.\n\n\"He clearly violated the conduct that the president should hold in terms of using his power to increase his political and personal gain,\" said Kate Pritchard, 63, a Democrat and retired teacher from Durango, Colorado. She said Congress was \"doing a good job with the inquiry and following the rules.\"\n\nThe telephone poll of 1,000 registered voters, taken Oct. 23-26, has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.\n\nMitt Romney: A solitary GOP voice battling Trump for the soul of the Republican Party\n\nLast week, even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took the rare step of distancing himself from a tweet by Trump that likened his impeachment to \u201ca lynching.\u201d\n\nIn the poll, though, 40% say they agree with the racially charged tweet; 54% disagree. The language that caused wide consternation was seen by some supporters as just another sign of Trump's willingness to disrupt the status quo, a quality they embrace. \"That's why I voted for Trump,\" Roma said. \"I'm trying to get away from the same-old, same-old Washington.\"\n\nCLOSE One of the country's leading civil rights organizations condemned President Donald Trump's tweet Tuesday. AP Domestic\n\nWho are those who endorse the president's analogy?\n\nUnsurprisingly, they are overwhelmingly Republican. Conservatives by more than 2-1 agree with the president\u2019s assertion. These core backers are disproportionately white and male. His strongest support comes from those who don't have a four-year college degree. They also tend to be older. Those 18 to 34 years old overwhelmingly disagree with the tweet; those 65 and older narrowly agree with it.\n\nThat is the portrait of those the White House is counting on for the impeachment battle ahead and for the re-election fight to follow.\n\nA word's power: Politicians have used 'lynching' as a metaphor for decades, but has time changed its impact?\n\nTrump\u2019s strongest support comes from those who say Fox News is the TV network they trusted most; 78% of Fox viewers say they agree that Trump\u2019s impeachment was like a \u201clynching.\u201d In contrast, just 2% of those who trust MSNBC most and 10% of those who trust CNN most agree with the statement.\n\nRemoved from office?\n\nOn one issue, the president\u2019s support sinks to just one in four, a sign of a potential vulnerability. Asked if the White House had an obligation to comply with subpoenas from the House committees demanding testimony and documents, 66% of those surveyed say yes, 26% say no. Those who think the White House should comply with congressional subpoenas include 35% of Republicans.\n\nWho's been subpoenaed?: All the people subpoenaed in impeachment inquiry\n\n\u201cI do feel it is inappropriate for the executive branch to be stonewalling,\u201d said Michael Dunford, 35, a Democrat from Solana Beach, California. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it is obstruction of justice, but it is obstruction.\u201d\n\nIn the new USA TODAY/Suffolk survey, Americans of all stripes are inclined to think the House won\u2019t end up voting to impeach Trump, 56%-37%. Most Democrats and most Republicans agree that he\u2019s not likely to be removed from office. Nearly three in four of all those surveyed, 73%, predict he won\u2019t be.\n\n\u201cHe should be impeached to discourage the awful behavior,\u201d Andre Mendes, 60, an engineer from Baltimore who supports the Green Party, said of Trump. \"But Republicans would have to grow a spine in order for removal from office to occur.\u201d\n\n2020 elections: Poll shows Iowa 'up for grabs' as Buttigieg surges into top tier\n\nPelosi vs. Trump: Combatants in impeachment showdown that will test them, nation\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/29/trump-poll-impeachment-ukraine-call-core-supporters/2478185001/", "description": "Even as support for impeachment grows,  President Trump is backed by unshakable supporters who deny he has done anything wrong.
