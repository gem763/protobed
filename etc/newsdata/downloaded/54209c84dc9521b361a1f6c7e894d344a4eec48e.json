API/S\n\nAnalysts had estimated U.S. crude inventories rose around\n\n2.8 million barrels last week.\n\n\"An enormous U.S. inventory build hits at precisely the\n\nwrong moment when the markets are overly focused on demand\n\ndevastation due to the latest run of weaker global economic\n\ndata,\" Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific market strategist at\n\nAxiTrader, said in a note on Thursday.\n\nIf confirmed by the government data, the build-up would be\n\nthe biggest U.S. inventory swell since February, 2017, Innes\n\nsaid.\n\nIt comes amid concerns about the global economy - and\n\ntherefore oil demand - as data from the United States showed\n\nretail sales fell for the first time in seven months in\n\nSeptember. That followed earlier data showing a moderation in\n\njob growth and services sector activity. Still, hopes of a potential U.S.-China trade deal helped\n\noffset oil prices losses after Mnuchin said U.S. and Chinese\n\ntrade negotiators are working on nailing down a Phase 1 trade\n\ndeal text for their presidents to sign next month. \"Overall, we are seeing a more constructive picture both in\n\nterms of the demand side of the equation with the partial\n\nagreement from the U.S. (and) also from a technical point of\n\nview. (Prices) are at close to the bottom end of trading range\n\nrather than the top,\" said Michael McCarthy, chief market\n\nstrategist at brokerage CMC Markets in Sydney.\n\nBut short-term pressure on oil prices will likely remain\n\nuntil U.S. government data on oil inventory is out later on\n\nThursday, he added.", "description": "UPDATE 1-Oil prices fall on signs of large U.S. stock build", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEAAC0WU_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
