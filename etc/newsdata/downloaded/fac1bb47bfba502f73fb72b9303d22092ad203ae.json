Widodo has previously said that he wants young business executives to join his cabinet.\n\nIn a statement, a Gojek spokesperson told TechCrunch that Andre Soelistyo, Gojek Group President and Kevin Aluwi, Gojek co-founder, are taking over as co-CEOs of the startup.\n\n\u201cWe are very proud that our founder will play such a significant role in moving Indonesia onto the global stage. It is unprecedented for a passionate local founder\u2019s vision to be recognized as a model that can be up-scaled to help the development of an entire country,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cWe have planned for this possibility and there will be no disruption to our business.

We respect the process set out by the President and will not make a further comment until there is an official announcement from the Palace,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\nMakarim (pictured above) said he was honored that the president had asked him to join his cabinet as a minister. He did not reveal which position he would hold, but an announcement from Widodo is expected later this week. \u201cI am very happy to be here today as it shows we are ready for innovation and to move forward,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nMakarim founded Gojek in 2010 as a two-wheeler hailing service.
