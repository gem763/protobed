Mann\u2019s \u201cThe Contender: The Story of Marlon Brando\u201d is a big, sprawling, meticulously researched and, for the most part, compelling biography that tells us everything we ever wanted to know about the man and then some. Brando lived a messy life, so maybe it\u2019s appropriate that his biography is somewhat messy, too, with its not-quite-chronological arrangement.\n\nBorn in 1924, Brando spent his first years in Omaha, where his mother was active in the Omaha Community Playhouse \u2014 something Marlon, oddly, didn\u2019t learn until early adulthood. Then the family moved to Illinois. Both parents were alcoholics, Dad abused Mom, and young Marlon had to rescue her more than once from drunken escapades beyond the family\u2019s property lines. Not the happiest childhood, and when he grew up, he forswore alcohol like it was, well, monogamy.\n\nA prep school teacher recognized his acting talent, and Brando moved soon after to New York, where he impressed theater people, among them the great teacher Stella Adler of the Dramatic Workshop. Eventually Adler\u2019s family took him in, and she became the mother he\u2019d never had, while her daughter Ellen became his first true love.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMann ably captures Brando\u2019s blossoming in New York\u2019s theater world. When he acted in a play at the New School, his classmate Mae Cooper recalled, it \u201cgave you the chills.\u201d Was this the apathetic student she\u2019d barely noticed in class? \u201cIt was like suddenly you woke up and there\u2019s your idiot child playing Mozart.\u201d Others, including actress Jessica Tandy, just thought him a \u201cpsychopathic bastard.\u201d\n\nAnother person central to his development was director Elia Kazan, also involved with the Dramatic Workshop, who worked with Brando first on stage and then on two of his best early movies, \u201cStreetcar\u201d and \u201cWaterfront.\u201d\n\nAfter those early successes, though, Brando started making movies more for the money than the quality. Some became hits, but by the 1960s most were not.\n\nMann stresses that Brando was also a serious and expansive reader and that he got involved in the civil rights movement, not just offering financial support but also attending rallies around the country. Mann also details the numerous lovers he left heartbroken, including actress Rita Moreno, who attempted suicide during their tumultuous relationship.\n\nBy the early \u201970s Brando was pretty much washed up in Hollywood. But young Francis Coppola thought he\u2019d be perfect as Vito Corleone in \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d and Brando, who liked the novel, agreed to humble himself and audition for the role. His performance changed the mind of Paramount\u2019s head, and he won the part.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe got along with Coppola. According to Mann, it was his happiest collaboration since Kazan nearly 20 years earlier, and the movie, released in 1972, reignited his career and won him his second Oscar. But after its success and the succ\u00e8s de scandale of \u201cLast Tango in Paris,\u201d released in the United States the following year, Brando went back to doing movies for cash.\n\nHence it was even more disheartening when Coppola and Brando reunited seven years later for \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d and found themselves at odds. Brando was so overweight that he insisted that Coppola shoot around the excess baggage, but Coppola wanted to use Brando\u2019s body to show that his character, the demented Colonel Kurtz, was \u201ca man eating all the time and overindulging.\u201d Brando prevailed. \u201cApocalypse,\u201d in its original release, ran 2\u00bd hours, and Brando doesn\u2019t appear until the last half-hour. He\u2019s barely visible. He\u2019s shot in the dark, in murky close-ups, in dim long shots. He might as well have been invisible.\n\nFrom then on, his films were mostly unremarkable. Brando did get nominated for a noteworthy supporting role in the otherwise unnoteworthy \u201cA Dry White Season\u201d (1989), and he made one surprising comedy, \u201cThe Freshman\u201d (1990), in which he gently parodied his own Don Vito role. Mann writes: \u201cEven in his least successful roles, there is something. None of his performances is a throwaway.\u201d But many were.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the prologue, Mann also makes the questionable assertion that \u201cBrando\u2019s acting, as great and as important as it is, is not the most interesting thing about him.\u201d But our interest in him, our interest in Mann\u2019s book, springs from his best acting \u2014 not from his admirable political activism, his Tahitian island getaway, his frequent affairs, his numerous wives, his many children, the attempted suicides of several people around him, the murder one son committed or the suicide of his daughter in Tahiti. That\u2019s all grist for a bio, but it\u2019s not the main attraction.\n\nA footnote: With the success of \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d that Bronx Italian restaurant, Louie\u2019s, should\u2019ve become a tourist destination, folks from all over flocking to it. Alas, it closed before the movie opened. Word on the street was that the owner got in over his head to a local loan shark and fled town. Too bad. The owner had a good thing and didn\u2019t know it.\n\nMichael F. Covino is the author of three books including the novel \u201cThe Negative.\u201d He has worked as a film critic for the East Bay Express and served as its books editor as well.\n\nThe Contender\n\nThe Story of Marlon Brando\n\nBy William J.
