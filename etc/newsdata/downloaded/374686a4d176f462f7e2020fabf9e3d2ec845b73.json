With his nippiness and especially low centre of gravity at 1.70m (no Conor Murray, or Joost van der Westhuizen) he has shown before that he can be mightily effective in that capacity.\n\nBut with the Boks seemingly so earmarked \u2013 unless coach Rassie Erasmus has some red herrings in store -- for a forward-propelled, predominantly unadventurous game-plan against the contrastingly daring, fleet-footed Japanese in Sunday\u2019s World Cup quarter-final in Tokyo (12:15 SA time), expect De Klerk to be right at the fulcrum of the favourites\u2019 approach to it.\n\nIf his aerial kicks are pinpoint and the Boks keep winning them back, it should, admittedly, go quite a long way to ensuring a major, decisive foothold on the contest \u2026 possibly even allowing them the liberty of a more expansive approach as the tussle advances, which would also be when someone like reserve \u201cscrummie\u201d Herschel Jantjies potentially comes right into his own.\n\nBut if the Boks are toppled against the odds, and the SA formula comes under sharp (and pretty certainly angry) post-game scrutiny, you would also expect that the customary \u201cFaf way\u201d of doing things will not escape that debate.\n\nThe Sale Sharks man \u2013 his overall tenacity hardly in doubt, especially as he can be a fine \u201crescuing\u201d defender in hairy situations \u2013 will be playing his own first knockout match at a World Cup, only having debuted in green and gold several months after completion of the 2015 tournament.\n\nBut he will be earning a 28th cap on Sunday, having been the unashamed first choice of Erasmus \u2013 and mostly during predecessor Allister Coetzee\u2019s tenure, too \u2013 for key matches both this year and last, so he can hardly be deemed inexperienced.\n\nDe Klerk has not yet wowed at RWC 2019, having been quite considerably below his best in both the defeat to New Zealand (23-13) and victory over Italy (49-3) as the starting No 9.\n\nOn the brighter side, he played very decently in the 41-7 triumph over the Japanese just ahead of the World Cup in Saitama, where he produced a nice break to tee up a Cheslin Kolbe try, kicked effectively for the most part and also got up fast on defence a few times to thwart the home team\u2019s desired attacking fluidity.\n\nBut a third successive off-colour showing within the major event itself will only increase the already well-subscribed clamour for a change to either Jantjies or Cobus Reinach as \u201cnumero uno\u201d in the Bok scrumhalf pecking order.\n\nWhether you are partial to him or not, De Klerk does seem to walk a tightrope a lot of the time \u2026\n\n*Follow our chief writer on Twitter: @RobHouwing", "description": "Like it or not, Faf de Klerk will probably have as pronounced a tactical influence as ever for the Boks in their RWC quarter-final against Japan, writes <strong>Rob Houwing</strong>.", "authors": ["Rob Houwing - Chief Writer"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9482/ac799cb8aa4a49f8a918784e4eec27ae.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
