Mind you, the App Store generated over $50 billion in sales last year, with over 60% of that money coming from direct searches.\n\nRead more: Some Apple employees are reportedly frustrated with the health team's direction and want to tackle bigger challenges within the healthcare system\n\nThe Times worked with Sensor Tower, a company that tracks and analyzes mobile app data, to examine how Apple-created apps benefited from popular searches and how search results changed over time. Here's a look at some of the most interesting and startling discoveries from the investigation:\n\nIn 2013, before Apple unveiled Apple Music, Spotify was the top result for \"music\" searches in the App Store.\n\nApple Music took the top \"music\" search result when it debuted in 2016, kicking Spotify to the No. 4 spot.\n\nApple's Wallet was the top search result for \"money,\" \"credit,\" and \"debit\" earlier this year right after Apple debuted its credit card.\n\nIn 2018, Apple apps appeared in the first eight results for \"music\" \u2014 including unrelated apps like iMovie and Clips \u2014 pushing Spotify to the No. 23 spot.\n\nApple surfaced 14 different Apple-made apps when you searched \"podcast\" in the App Store in 2018, pushing some competitors so far down in search results that one said the App Store no longer provided a meaningful source of downloads.\n\nApple executives Phil Schiller and Eddy Cue said the App Store algorithm has since been \"improved\" to no longer prioritize Apple apps in some searches, but refused to call the past rankings or algorithm a mistake or issue that needed fixing in the first place.\n\nSchiller and Cue refused to admit to any wrongdoing on Apple's part. They say the App Store presents \"results based on what we think the user wants,\" and said Apple apps usually rank high in search results because their apps have generic names that tend to match with popular search terms.\n\nBusiness Insider has reached out to both Apple and Spotify for any additional comment on the Times' investigation.\n\nRead more: Apple was secretly working a feature that would have reportedly let iPhones text each other without cell service\n\nAccording to some anonymous Apple employees that spoke to The Times, Apple's algorithm was responsible for Apple's recent domination in the App Store, but App Store engineers made a tweak to the algorithm in July when they noticed that search results for months had been packed with Apple apps. Schiller and Cue said the algorithm was \"working properly\" at the time, but \"simply decided to handicap themselves to help other developers,\" according to The Times.\n\nApple engineers said the App Store algorithm looks at 42 different signals, including relevance and rankings based on downloads and reviews, but the company still keeps mum on how exactly the algorithm works to prevent people from gaming the system.\n\nCheck out The Times full analysis from its investigation into the App Store.", "description": "Apple execs Phil Schiller and Eddy Cue confirmed that Apple's apps topped most search results in the App Store, but insisted it wasn't an error.", "authors": ["Dave Smith"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d765d782e22af4fcb384c89-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
