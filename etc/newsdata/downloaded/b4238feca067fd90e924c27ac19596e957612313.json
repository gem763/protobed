That night, President Donald Trump jumped on Twitter and compared Wallace unfavorably to his late father.\n\n\u201cSomebody please explain to Chris Wallace of Fox, who will never be his father (and my friend), Mike Wallace, that the Phone Conversation I had with the President of Ukraine was a congenial & good one,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nExpect much more of the same to follow.\n\nTwo days earlier, Shepard Smith, whose tough and factual reporting style often drew the ire of Trump and his supporters, abruptly left the network. For years, Smith served not only as Fox News\u2019 premier breaking news anchor but also as the most prominent banner carrier for the network\u2019s team of straight-news reporters.\n\nHis abdication positions Wallace as his natural successor. It\u2019s a role guaranteed to attract fire. Trump has made it clear that he doesn\u2019t appreciate it when his favorite TV channel exposes its viewers to unflattering news about him.", "description": "Chris Wallace is the \"new faces of the Trump resistance\" at Fox News following the departure of Shep Smith, according to Bloomberg News.", "authors": ["Breitbart News"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP_16345726074257-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
