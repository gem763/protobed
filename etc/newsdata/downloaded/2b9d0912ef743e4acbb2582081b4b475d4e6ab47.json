Do the endless <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFL?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#NFL</a> polls of sports fans that support racist names/logos help to uphold this racist nonsense? The APA certainly knows it does. Stop racism when you see it. <a href=\"https://t.co/DTHrcJWfBv\">https://t.co/DTHrcJWfBv</a> \u2014@RobynWins111\n\nFor Indigenous people in Canada, the ad perpetuated a racial slur.\n\n\"It has huge connotations. 'Sauvage' was to say we were dirty, uncivilized, that we had no culture. So this is not good at all. This is a racial slur for any Indigenous French-speaking person,\" said Melissa Mollen-Dupuis, the co-founder of Idle No More's branch in Quebec.\n\nThe 60-second ad for Sauvage perfume features actor Johnny Depp, First Nations actress Tanaya Beatty and dancer Canku One Star (Dior)\n\n\"It's as if they used the N-word to promote a perfume.\"\n\nFashion designer Lesley Hampton said the ad reinforces old stereotypes.\n\n\"We're not wild or savage or all these connotations that the history books or the movie created us as,\" she said in Toronto, where she is preparing for Fashion Week. \"It's a slap on the face to us.\"\n\nFashion designer Lesley Hampton calls the ad 'a slap in the face.' (Sharon Wu/CBC News)\n\nThe Instagram post, a behind-the-scenes video about the ad, said the group Americans for Indian Opportunity were consulted.\n\n\"Cultural appropriation for us is a huge thing because we've been dealing with this since colonization,\" Ron Martinez, a consultant with the non-profit organization, said in the video.\n\n\"Our presence on this project is for us to make sure the look and identity is authentic. It's very important.\"\n\nIt's not the first time both Depp and Dior have been accused of cultural appropriation. Adrienne Keene, the Cherokee blogger behind Native Appropriations documented a long list of problems with Johnny Depp's representation of Indigenous people since his role as Tonto in the 2013 Disney movie The Lone Ranger.\n\nFrom 2015.

In 1998, British fashion designer John Galliano launched an Indigenous-influenced fall collection for Dior called \"A Voyage on the Diorient Express, or the Story of the Princess Pocahontas.\"\n\nThe company has not responded to an email seeking comment on the ads or its deletion.
