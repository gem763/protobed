Gerry Connolly (D-VA), a House Oversight Committee member who chairs the subcommittee with jurisdiction over Trump\u2019s hotel in Washington, said in the Politico report.\u201cThat was the risk from Day One: foreign governments and others trying to seek favor because we know Trump pays attention to this. \u2026 It\u2019s an obvious attempt to curry favor with him.\u201d\n\nPolitico reported on what sparked yet another investigation:\n\nThe investigation began after the committee received information that two entities \u2014 a trade association and a foreign government \u2014 booked a large quantity of rooms but used only a fraction of them, according to a person familiar with the allegation who isn\u2019t authorized to speak for the committee. The emoluments clause of the Constitution forbids a president from profiting from foreign governments or receiving any money from the U.S. government except his or her annual salary.\n\nThe Politico report included remarks from several Democrats on the committee, including Rep. Ro Khanna, (D-CA).\n\n\u201cIf true, at minimum, this suggests there is a culture of corruption that the administration has created,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that to curry favor you have to engage in pay to play. That\u2019s exactly what the American people hate about Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump has repeatedly denied that he is using the presidency to promote his resorts,\u201d Politico reported.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of hotels all over the place, and people, they use them because they\u2019re the best,\u201d Trump told reporters last month.\n\n\u201cTrump already faces lawsuits alleging he violated the Constitution by accepting payments from foreign officials at his resorts and hotels,\u201d Politico reported. \u201cHis company donated nearly $200,000 to the U.S. Treasury in February that it said came from profits from foreign governments, but watchdog groups say the amount should higher.\u201d", "description": "The Democrat-controlled House Oversight Committee has been looking into an allegation that groups have rented rooms in Trump hotels.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/trump-hotel-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
