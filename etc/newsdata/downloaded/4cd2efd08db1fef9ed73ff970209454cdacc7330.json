Photo: A24\n\nEvery fart rings out like a gunshot in The Lighthouse. Robert Eggers\u2019s new movie, a thriller set in the late 1800s, doesn\u2019t aim for body horror. But it is about the horror of bodies, bodies that have been placed in forced proximity to one another for an interminable stretch of time. The sound of a casual piss reverberates through the house that the main (and only) two characters split. The contents of a chamberpot get blown back in the face of the person trying to empty it, giving him a revolting reminder that, hey, everyone poops. That same character, a young man named Ephraim Winslow (Robert Pattinson), narrowly avoids getting hit in the face with jizz when he stumbles onto his more senior colleague in lighthouse keeping, Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe), getting a little too intimate with the lamp. Not that Winslow is in a place to judge anyone\u2019s stroke material, no matter how odd \u2014 when he seizes a moment to himself to furtively jerk off, his masturbatory aid of choice is a crudely carved mermaid figurine.\n\nWinslow and Wake couldn\u2019t get away from each other if they tried. They\u2019ve been assigned to a four-week stretch on a tiny, inhospitable island that consists of little more than the title structure, the adjoining building in which they both reside, and a signal house from which a foghorn blares. The two men, strangers who\u2019ve only just met, share a bedroom, and in the evening they share a meal over a cramped table. Even the frame is confining; the film is shot in an aspect ratio only slightly wider than a square. The darkness at its corners feels like it\u2019s eating away at the limited amount of space the characters have to occupy. The Lighthouse\ufeff is such an effective exercise in projecting claustrophobia, in both a physical and psychological sense, that it\u2019d be unbearable to watch if it weren\u2019t so funny. Thankfully, it\u2019s a scream. Pry away the historical trappings, the remote locale, the maritime-tinged language and the building hallucinations, and what you have is a story about roommates getting on each other\u2019s nerves in grandiose fashion.\n\nEggers made his splashy debut in 2015 with The Witch, a genuinely unsettling horror story about a colonist family that managed the difficult trick of depicting not just Puritan life but Puritan thinking, settling itself into the mind-set of characters who didn\u2019t just believe in the devil but believed the devil to be as imminent a threat to their precarious existence as failed crops or a bad winter. The Lighthouse is another old-timey effort, and like The Witch, it\u2019s exacting in its period details while also feeling insistently lived in \u2014 you can sense how bad the men must smell as they pull their work clothes over the union suits they never seem to take off. To say The Lighthouse isn\u2019t as good a film as The Witch feels both accurate and a little unfair, if only because the aims of The Lighthouse, which Eggers wrote with his brother, Max, are so much more modest and silly. It has more in common with the gleefully eccentric work of Guy Maddin than anything that sets out to scare. It\u2019s about two men who might be harboring dark secrets that are eating them up inside but who really end up destroying each other over their inability to establish personal and professional boundaries.\n\nAt the core of the film is Pattinson\u2019s impressively committed performance as the taciturn Winslow. As Wake, Dafoe gets to start big and just bend what he\u2019s doing around the warps in the film\u2019s reality. But Winslow\u2019s is the point of view from which the film takes place, that of a greenhorn who discovers his co-worker is an irrational taskmaster by day and a garrulous alcoholic at night and equally demanding in both roles. Pattinson, whose face looks even more angular when photographed in black and white, has to navigate a slow build while scarcely talking at all. For a long stretch of the film, Winslow\u2019s most overt displays of emotion involve not Wake but an aggressive seagull that won\u2019t leave him alone. Dafoe may be a delight as a sea-brined gremlin with a bottomless thirst and a surprising sensitivity about his own cooking (\u201cYer fond of me lobster,\u201d he howls at one point. \u201cSay it!\u201d). But it\u2019s Pattinson, playing the straight man, who sells the slow deterioration of the pair\u2019s mental state. Winslow vacillates between grounded moments and ones in which any sense of rationality or time passing slip away \u2014 his brooding guilt barely able to compete with his roiling irritation at having to listen to Wake tell one more rambling anecdote.", "description": "The Lighthouse, Robert Eggers\u2019 follow-up to The Witch, is a stranger, sillier horror movie starring Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe as lighthouse keepers whose sanity starts to slip when they\u2019re assigned to a four-week stretch alone on an island.", "authors": ["Alison Willmore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/18/18-the-lighthouse.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
