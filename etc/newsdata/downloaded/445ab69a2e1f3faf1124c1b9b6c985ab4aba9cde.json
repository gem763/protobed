Whether you agree or find it repellent, there is nothing subtle about the obvious pitching of this No 10 against former Remainers.\n\nThe truth is a delay would be a policy failure for the prime minister - forget for the moment that he and his team would use it to help their efforts to win a broader political argument.\n\nBut inside government there is a belief that it might not quite be over. Don't all scream at once. Yes, there are lawyers everywhere warning that there is no way round the so-called Benn Act and they may well be absolutely right.\n\nThere are active attempts in court to make sure that the legal provisions to force an extension are watertight. And several Cabinet ministers have told me they can see no way to avoid a delay if there is no deal. More in sorrow than in anger one told me \"the EU will do what it always does, play long, and we'll have to agree\".\n\nBut inside Number 10 there are still discussions about whether to send a second letter to the EU - meaning the government would comply with the Benn Act demanding that the government has to seek a delay in letter one but then send another letter alongside it essentially denouncing that idea from a political perspective.\n\nPut that alongside likely protestations from the prime minister that a delay would be pointless, and perhaps that he would refuse to negotiate any further, and we might all find ourselves in an extremely turbulent period, where the reactions of the EU could be hard to predict.\n\nThis would likely see the government almost immediately facing challenges in court, or perhaps even pursuing a few of their own.\n\nBut despite all of the legal and political speculation, as I've written before, this is an untested area where there are no precedents and no conventions to guide us. That's why some of the wilder suggestions, including one that Boris Johnson might even refuse to move out of Number 10 if he loses a confidence vote and can't form a government, are impossible at the moment to exclude.\n\nWhatever happens on 19 October, that may be the moment when the extent of the provocation Downing Street is willing to pursue becomes clear.\n\nPS. Whatever you think of the aggressive noises coming out of the government about the state of the negotiations and the audacity of their plans, be in no doubt it is designed to convey a message to the EU not to expect Boris Johnson to compromise more readily after the likely general election.\n\nEssentially the dramatic language is designed not just to irritate their opponents, but also to make it clear to their negotiating opponents that any Brexit offer from the UK, if there is a Tory majority after the election, is likely to be a harder not softer one and the EU will face a government less willing to compromise, not more.\n\nThe hope is to make it seem to the EU that their safest choice is to grab this deal. But at this stage, there is not much sign of that happening.\n\nPPS. All the hostility has created a separate row in the Tory Party over what goes in their election manifesto. Some Brexit hawks believe it ought to promise an automatic no-deal departure if they win the election (a huge if!)\n\nThat suggestion riled some ministers and MPs who believe they now have some assurances from Mr Johnson that it would not be so stark.\n\nAs I understand it there is no final decision. But a likely position is a souped-up version of the PM's 31 October pledge - where the manifesto would say the Conservatives would like to leave with a deal, but if a tight deadline - maybe extremely tight - can't be met, then it's no deal at a pace.\n\nTheir upset is yet more evidence of Boris Johnson's challenge in keeping the Tories together, and trying to be able to please both former Remain voters and Leavers alike.", "description": "A one-off Commons sitting may show how far Boris Johnson is willing to go to resist another Brexit delay.", "authors": ["Laura Kuenssberg", "Political Editor"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8617/production/_109172343_mediaitem109172199.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
