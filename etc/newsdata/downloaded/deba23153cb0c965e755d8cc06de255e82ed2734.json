REUTERS/Oren Ben Hakoon\n\nBut on Tuesday Netanyahu failed, for the second time since April, to secure a clear victory in parliamentary elections. And now all eyes are turning to a former Netanyahu aide who stood up to his former boss five months ago, and may now decide whether the Netanyahu era continues, or comes to an end.\n\nThe potential new kingmaker is Avigdor Lieberman, a far-right immigrant from Moldova who lives in an Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank and who served as an aide to Netanyahu during the 1990s.\n\nLieberman, 61, has none of Netanyahu\u2019s polish and international prestige, but took a huge gamble by refusing to join a Netanyahu coalition government on a point of principle in an election last April.\n\nIf exit polls and early vote tallies prove correct, he reaped the reward by boosting his party\u2019s seat numbers in the Sept. 17 rerun.\n\n\u201cLieberman will again tip the balance,\u201d the liberal Haaretz daily said in a banner headline after Tuesday\u2019s vote.\n\nA partial tally showed the conservative Netanyahu tied with his centrist rival Benny Gantz. Neither has enough support from like-minded parties to create a coalition with a clear parliamentary majority. That has left both relying on Lieberman.\n\n\u201cThe conclusion is clear - all that we have said during the election campaign is coming true,\u201d he told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cThere is only one option - a national unity government, a liberal, broad government, and we will indeed say again, we will not join any other option.\u201d\n\nSECULAR VS. RELIGIOUS\n\nLieberman, a former defence minister under Netanyahu, made his stand on the long-standing divide within Israel between its secular and ultra-religious communities.\n\nHe refused to serve alongside ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties who have long been allies in Netanyahu-led ruling coalitions, and who wield influence over everyday life in Israel, including the administration of marriage and divorce.\n\nLieberman\u2019s determined secular stance played well with other secular Israelis, including his fellow immigrants from the former Soviet Union, many of whom are not deemed Jewish according to strict ritual law.\n\nLieberman originally belonged to Netanyahu\u2019s Likud Party but quit it to form the far-right Yisrael Beitenu (Israel is our Home) in 1999, appealing to fellow Russian-speakers with his secularist agenda and tough talk against Palestinians.\n\nLieberman is now pushing for a \u201cnational unity\u201d government that would include his own party, which is predicted to take 9 of the parliament\u2019s 120 seats, alongside Likud and Gantz\u2019s Blue and White party, forecast to have around 32 seats each. The final tally may not be known for days.\n\nWhere Netanyahu fits into the new picture is anyone\u2019s guess. Gantz, a centrist former army general, has said he is open to teaming up with Likud, but not if it is led by Netanyahu.\n\nDuring months of campaigning Gantz excoriated Netanyahu over long-standing corruption allegations.\n\nNetanyahu, who denies wrongdoing, is set for a pre-trial hearing next month. He is expected to argue that the charges should be dismissed in the national interest, and his critics believe that is a key motive for him seeking so strenuously to continue his premiership into a record fifth term.\n\nTIMELINE TO SHOWDOWN\n\nLieberman served in several Israeli cabinets, most recently as Netanyahu\u2019s defence minister. But he resigned from that post last year, protesting at what he saw as government weakness in the face of rocket attacks by Palestinian Islamists in Gaza.\n\nThat walkout destabilised Netanyahu\u2019s coalition, and ultimately led to the April election, in which Lieberman won five parliament seats.\n\nNetanyahu, a master coalition-builder, was widely expected to repeat his past successes in putting together a government. But he was blindsided when Lieberman refused to lend his support, citing his dissatisfaction that many ultra-Orthodox are granted exemptions from service in the Israeli military.\n\nThat gambit improved Lieberman\u2019s standing - raising his profile, potentially doubling his seats and, early indications suggest, extending his popularity beyond his original base of ex-Soviet immigrants.\n\nWith campaign billboards reading \u201cMake Israel Normal Again\u201d, Lieberman\u2019s secular-nationalist platform included support for Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Most world powers deem the settlements as illegal, a view disputed by Israel.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nLieberman, who as a younger man worked as an airport baggage handler and bar bouncer, seemed at ease while electioneering. Netanyahu, ubiquitous on the airwaves and social media, emerged from the campaign hoarse and subdued, giving a downbeat post-election address that neither claimed victory nor conceded defeat.\n\nLieberman said he did not rule out Netanyahu as a political ally or underestimate a leader whose supporters still regard him as a \u201cmagician\u201d.\n\n\u201c(But) I will not go to a Halacha government,\u201d he said, in a reference to Jewish ritual law and ultra-Orthodox party participation in a coalition.", "description": "Half a year ago one man stood alone and unchallenged on the summit of Israeli politics - the veteran right-wing populist Benjamin Netanyahu, known as \"King Bibi\" to his loyal followers.", "authors": ["Stephen Farrell", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431216161&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0UW", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
