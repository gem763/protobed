USA TODAY\n\nIt\u2019s Week 8 of the fantasy football season. If you are looking for an unexpected roster replacement or an inexpensive starter for your daily fantasy lineup, here are players who could help.\n\nFANTASY RANKINGS:How they stack up at each position in Week 8\n\nThese deep sleepers are players flying under the radar whose matchups suggest they could have a big game in Week 8. Just remember, they are risky fantasy plays given the other options likely available.\n\nQB Derek Carr, Oakland Raiders\n\nCarr has thrown for over 250 yards and multiple touchdowns this season just twice. This week, he plays a Houston Texans defense allowing near 300 passing yards and over two touchdowns per game. In what's expected to be high-scoring game, Carr should hit the 250-yard mark with multiple touchdowns for a top-10 finish.\n\nRaiders quarterback Derek Carr threw for 293 yards and two touchdowns in Week 7. (Photo: Jeff Hanisch, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nRB J.D. McKissic, Detroit Lions\n\nAll eyes are on Lions rookie running back Ty Johnson, who takes over for the injured Kerryon Johnson. However, McKissic still will have a large role given his experience with coordinator Darrell Bevell\u2019s offense and his ability to catch the ball out of the backfield. The Lions play a New York Giants team giving up almost 170 all-purpose yards and one touchdown per game to the position. A solid flex option, expect double digit fantasy points from McKissic in point-per-reception (PPR) leagues.\n\nWR Diontae Johnson, Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nJohnson was on the rise with Mason Rudolph at quarterback until Rudolph was injured. Over three games with Rudolph under center, Johnson had 14 catches for 156 yards and two touchdowns. Rudolph returns this week and should reconnect with Johnson for 60-80 yards and a touchdown against a porous Miami Dolphins pass defense.\n\nTE Josh Hill, New Orleans Saints\n\nWith Jared Cook expected to miss a second consecutive game, Hill makes for a sneaky streaming option. Through seven games, the Arizona Cardinals have allowed an average of seven receptions, 81 yards and a touchdown to tight ends. Expect similar numbers for the talented but underused Hill.\n\nSeattle Seahawks defense/special teams\n\nIn seven games, the Seahawks have held quarterbacks to under 210 yards passing in four games, with three of those games under 180 yards. Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan may play despite an ankle injury that caused him to miss two practices this week. If he doesn\u2019t play, underwhelming backup Matt Schaub would start. Regardless, everything points to the Falcons struggling to score on the Seahawks.\n\nJim Saranteas, aka \"The Fantasy Greek,\" is a contributing writer for Ourlads.com, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
