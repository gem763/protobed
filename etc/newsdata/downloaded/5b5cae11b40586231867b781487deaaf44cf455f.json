(AP) - New York Giants wide receiver Sterling Shepard said he knew he had a concussion in the season opener against Dallas but played to try to help the team win.\n\nSpeaking on Friday for the first time since sustaining the concussion on Sept. 8, Shepard said he didn\u2019t start feeling normal until this week.\n\nShepard played the entire game in the 35-17 loss to the Cowboys. The team seemingly didn\u2019t find out about the concussion until after the game in the locker room. Shepard was sidelined in the 28-14 loss to the Buffalo Bills at home last weekend.\n\nThe four-year receiver practiced this week and is expected to play Sunday when the Giants (0-2) face the Buccaneers (1-1) in Tampa, Florida.\n\nThe NFL is trying to determine why spotters tasked with looking for players hurt during games didn\u2019t see Shepard was injured in the third quarter. The spotters and medical personnel can have a player taken off the field if they suspect a possible concussion.\n\n\u201cThey tried to send someone in there for me and I just kind of waved them off,\u201d Shepard said. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s my decision, I guess, to say to stay in.\u201d\n\nShepard said it took him a few plays until he felt OK, but he realized he probably was dealing with a concussion.\n\nWhen asked why he stayed in and why he would risk his health, Shepard seemed uncertain.\n\n\u201cIt was an in-the-moment decision,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like I wanted to stay in and help my boys out, so that\u2019s why I did it.\u201d\n\nShepard said he passed all the concussion tests the day after the game, but he didn\u2019t start feeling good to Sunday or Monday.\n\nCoach Pat Shurmur said Shepard\u2019s concussion was being investigated \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d and he couldn\u2019t answer any questions.\n\nShepard became the Giants\u2019 go-to receiver with the offseason trade of Odell Beckham Jr. to Cleveland.\n\nDaniel Jones, the sixth overall draft pick, is making his first start since replacing Eli Manning. Veteran receiver Cody Latimer, who started the first two games, will miss Sunday\u2019s game with a concussion incurred last week.\n\n\u201cI am just trying to help him (Jones) any way I can,\u201d Shepard said. \u201cIt\u2019s his first time out there in live game action. It\u2019s my first time out there with him. That\u2019s where the week of preparation comes into play. You have to be on the same page with him and try to game his nerves a bit.\u201d\n\nShepard didn\u2019t have any reps with Jones in the preseason because he broke his thumb on the first day of practice in training camp.\n\nThe 26-year-old Shepard has played almost all his career with Manning as his quarterback. He felt Manning played well this season but the team didn\u2019t do enough to win.\n\n\u201cHe has been a great teammate and is going to remain a great teammate,\u201d Shepard said. \u201cThe guy handles everything like a pro and he is helping Daniel with the preparation. He will take his role serious and do everything to help Daniel.\u201d\n\nShepard caught passes with Jones after practice Friday. He said the rookie throws the ball a little harder than Manning and offers the option to run with the ball.\n\nShepard had six receptions for 42 yards against Dallas.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel good last week, sitting there watching my boys go out and play,\u201d Shepard said. \u201cSo I am excited to be back out there on the field with my boys.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Shurmur said Manning would back up Jones on Sunday. \u2026 Receivers used to hold a meeting with Manning after practice on the Friday before the game. The receivers were in the locker after practice. Jones will probably decide if and when he wants to meet with the receivers.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "New York Giants wide receiver Sterling Shepard said he knew he had a concussion in the season opener against Dallas but played to try to help the team win.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tom Canavan"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/giants_cowboys_football_28731_c0-281-4030-2630_s1770x1032.jpg?f2513547988fd91f4d50106508d0337905ebb180", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
