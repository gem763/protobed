But there\u2019s no question that an aviation revolution soon followed the political one of 1989. Today, the choice between a weekend in Brussels or Budapest is a question of taste (waffles or noodles?) rather than deep-seated ideology.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

This really was A Good Year: the year the world opened up. Shame about the terrible fashions. Freedom arrived in shoulder pads, big hair and batwing sleeves. Listicles didn\u2019t exist then, either. Truly, the world is a much better place now.\n\nHere\u2019s my listicle: countries that were \u201cclosed\u201d in 1989 but are \u201copen\u201d now.\n\nWhy the quote marks? This isn\u2019t an exact science. My definition of an open country is 1) getting a visa is straightforward, 2) the destination has a tourism industry that\u2019s interested in attracting overseas visitors, 3) you\u2019re not likely to be followed around by secret police and 4) there\u2019s not a war going on.\n\nIn eastern Europe we\u2019ve got Poland, the former East Germany, Hungary, Romania, Albania and Bulgaria.\n\nThen there are the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.\n\nThe big, bad daddy of The Russian Federation (in 1989, the USSR).\n\nYou can now visit all across Soviet Asia, to Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, Moldova, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan \u2013 which, from 1 February, offered visa-free travel for residents of 45 countries, including the UK \u2013 Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan.\n\nMongolia wasn\u2019t officially part of the USSR, but it might as well have been: it too had its revolution in 1990.\n\nAnd as we\u2019re heading into Asia, let\u2019s not forget that the global battle between communism and capitalism had, arguably, an even greater effect on more people there \u2013 and in 1989, more of that continent was in a sorry, and in some cases, horrific state of isolation.\n\nSouth Korea had shown Europe the way towards freedom with its own revolution in 1987. We\u2019re still waiting for its northern neighbour and may for a while yet. You could go to Japan in 1989, of course \u2013 if you could afford it.\n\nOtherwise, China had begun to dismantle Maoism. But this was the year of Tiananmen Square. Perhaps the least expected consequence of that brutality would be the Communist Party\u2019s policy of allowing an unprecedented number of its citizens out and others in.\n\nAs for countries in China\u2019s sphere of influence: Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos might as well have been on Mars for all the chance you had to go there and wear harem pants and get a Buddha tattoo. But 1989 was a landmark year here too: peace between Cambodia and Vietnam was finally reached and Cambodians were allowed to practise Buddhism and own private property.\n\nClosed Burma is now open Myanmar, even if the hopes the new wave of travellers had for that country have been sullied by the Rohingya genocide. Ending totalitarianism and military rule is rarely a case of black hats today, white hats tomorrow.\n\nHence the debate about Saudi Arabia\u2019s recent decision to welcome foreigners. In 1989, it was a decade into a policy of being the most conservative \u2013 that is, repressive and closed-off \u2013 theocratic Muslim state. In Iran, the death of Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989 and the election of Rafsanjani certainly made the climate more benign for western tourists.\n\nOman would open up to great success in the 1990s. High in the Himalayas, Bhutan would follow the same strategy of inviting in wealthy westerners.\n\nAs for Lebanon, the civil war had been raging on and on since the mid-Seventies. But \u2013 this really was a year of miracles \u2013 1989 brought peace. Journalists who once were kidnapped and chained to walls are now wined, dined and cultivated.\n\nAfrica? This was the year FW De Klerk became president of South Africa: the end of apartheid was nigh and with it the chance to travel not just to that beautiful country but also Mozambique, Botswana and Namibia. Angola\u2019s civil war would drag on until the next century. But that country is open too.\n\nAnd last to South America. Nicaragua, Panama and Colombia were all out of bounds as civil wars and invasions continued. You would have struggled in Cuba in 1989 \u2013 its tourist boom was yet to come. But there were free elections in Brazil and Paraguay: the continent was coming within reach of the ordinary traveller.\n\nSome countries were troubled then and are still: Afghanistan, North Korea. Iraq and Syria have gone from problematic to life-threatening. Sublime, sad Kashmir \u2013 not a country, but a place every avid traveller dreams of visiting \u2013 is once again off-limits.\n\nVenezuela was tough in 1989 and is a whole lot tougher now.\n\nBut open the atlas: the world today is a better and infinitely more accessible place, and that has a lot to do with the events of 1989.\n\nAnd we can\u2019t leave 1989 without one other landmark act that would make a huge difference to thousands of Britons. This was the year Iceland legalised beer drinking.\n\nYet for all the political and geographical changes, there were things happening that only a few academics and military planners knew about: things that would have even bigger implications for the future of travel.\n\nIn 1989, Tim Berners-Lee wrote a proposal for something called the commercial internet. And the first GPS satellites were launched. The world was about to become a lot smaller, more familiar and more accessible, wherever you were.", "description": "If you\u2019re under 30, brace yourself.
