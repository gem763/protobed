Sign up here.\n\nExecutives from the biggest U.S. financial firms, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., met with top regulators in Beijing in a sign that the trade war with the U.S. has done little to derail China\u2019s opening of its $43 trillion financial system.\n\nAmong those attending meetings at the Ritz-Carlton hotel on the city\u2019s Financial Street were Yi Gang, governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China and senior officials from the China Securities Regulatory Commission, according to an agenda that was seen by Bloomberg.\n\nEven as the trade war rages, China has continued to open its financial sector at an unprecedented pace, luring global banks seeking to compete for an estimated $9 billion in annual profits. While the policy has often been cast as addressing U.S. complaints that the Asian nation has been a one-sided beneficiary of trade, domestic motivations are also behind the push, said Michael Pettis, professor of finance at the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University.\n\n\u201cChina is very determined to reform its financial markets and knows that without the major American players, it is very hard to talk about having a truly internationalized market,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also makes sense for China to accommodate a very important source of lobbying support, especially as there\u2019s so little in the U.S. right now.\u201d\n\nForcing Change\n\nChinese regulators can\u2019t ignore the country\u2019s financial-market issues. Corporate bond defaults reached a record high last year and the nation\u2019s banks are seeing their balance sheets swell with ever more bad loans. Publicly-traded companies have come under increased scrutiny as a spate of poor disclosures -- from inaccurate IPO applications to an accounting \u201cerror\u201d that wiped out $4.4 billion -- left investors wary. Officials and academics say an influx of foreign competitors could help the industry get into shape and also sharpen the focus on just doing business.\n\n\u201cOpening up is a way of putting pressure on financial-system reforms, especially considering the many competing interest groups,\u201d said Li Haitao, dean\u2019s distinguished chair professor of finance at Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing.\n\nForeign firms wouldn\u2019t be burdened by the policy-oriented tasks, such as lending targets for private firms or rural industries that domestic firms need to take heed of, Zhang Chenghui, former head of the finance institute at the State Council Development Research Center, said at a recent conference in Yichun, suggesting that local firms may be allowed to shed these duties as the market opens to foreign competition.\n\nOther scheduled attendees at Friday\u2019s meeting in Beijing included China Vice Finance Minister Liao Min, CSRC Vice Chairman Fang Xinghai, Goldman Sachs Chief Operating Officer John Waldron and Morgan Stanley\u2019s global head of international business, Franck Petitgas, according to the agenda. Ken Griffin, who runs the hedge-fund firm Citadel, and Alan MacDonald, Citigroup Inc.\u2019s vice chairman, were also on the list, along with Chris Heady, chairman of Blackstone Group Inc.\u2019s Asia unit.\n\nSenior Wall Street executives attended a meeting with Chinese policy makers in Beijing in September 2018, people familiar with the matter said at the time. That meeting was also chaired by former PBOC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan and John Thornton, chairman of Barrick Gold Corp.\n\nForeign Cash\n\nChina\u2019s transition to a more consumption-driven economy has lead to a shrinking trade surplus -- a trend that could be accelerated by the trade war. As more and more Chinese are also lifted into the middle class and beyond, the need for managing that wealth is growing.\n\nDaniel Rosen, a partner at Rhodium Group LLC, an economic research firm based in New York, said the transformation of China and the limits of its policies, will likely mean \u201ctrillions of dollars\u201d in capital outflows in the years ahead.\n\n\u201cTo avoid balance of payments challenges, Beijing needs to attract correspondingly large capital inflows, and is plunging ahead with financial sector opening with this long-term reality in mind,\u201d he said.\n\nWall Street Allies\n\nCrucially, opening up could also allow China to make friends with people in the right places at a time of heightening political tension.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.\u00a0Sign up here.\u00a0Executives from the biggest U.S. financial firms, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., met with top regulators in Beijing in a sign that the trade war with the U.S", "authors": ["Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lAGMGtGheNZvr1AWH4ynTw--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/08f0fc7ced5b227d36c52b8310880bb5", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
