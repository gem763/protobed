A combination of stovetop cooking and oven baking ensures that the filling stays moist while the crust gets crisp. First, the spinach is cooked down in a mixture of butter, garlic and leeks until it wilts enough to release any moisture. Then, the filling is prepared, and the spanakopita assembled in the skillet. Give the phyllo a head start on the stovetop, then transfer to the oven so the spinach filling cooks through at the same time the phyllo becomes flaky. The timing may be precise for the cooking, but you can eat it whenever you want: This spanakopita is just as good at room temperature as it is warm.", "description": "Buttery, bright and herbaceous, this recipe is a faster take on the Greek spinach and feta pie and far less effort than forming individual triangular spanakopita pastries A combination of stovetop cooking and oven baking ensures that the filling stays moist while the crust gets crisp First, the spinach is cooked down in a mixture of butter, garlic and leeks until it wilts enough to release any moisture", "authors": ["Alexa Weibel", "Martha Rose Shulman", "David Tanis", "Colu Henry", "Kiera Wright-Ruiz", "Angela Dimayuga", "Julia Moskin", "Sara Bonisteel", "Florence Fabricant", "Robert Simonson"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/16/dining/aw-skillet-spanakopita/aw-skillet-spanakopita-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
