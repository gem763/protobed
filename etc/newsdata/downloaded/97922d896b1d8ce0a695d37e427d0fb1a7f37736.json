Mark S. Zaid, a Washington lawyer who represents the whistle-blower, reviewed the book in 2003, saying it contained revelations that would \u201cshock anyone to the left of Attila the Hun.\u201d\n\nBut experts see a civic danger in the president frequently and falsely calling out what he labels treasonous behavior. Carlton F.W. Larson, a professor at the University of California at Davis School of Law and an expert on treason, said the president had cheapened the word through overuse.\n\n\u201cIt is a complete debasement of political discourse where ordinary political disagreements are elevated to a level of capital crime,\u201d Mr. Larson said. \u201cIf Trump ever did uncover an instance of true treason, no one would believe him because he has so debased the meaning of that word.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump first mentioned treason in connection with the whistle-blower last week in a talk at the United States Mission to the United Nations, contending that what the whistle-blower was doing was spying and lamenting that there used to be a punishment for that, presumably meaning execution.\n\n\u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person who gave the whistle-blower the information, because that\u2019s close to a spy,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d", "description": "\u201cTreason\u201d is a word the president has increasingly used when talking about his critics.", "authors": ["Katie Rogers"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/30/us/politics/30dc-treason01/30dc-treason01-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
