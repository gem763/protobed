Sometimes cancellation causes that person to lose status and, for a time, recede from view. As for the claim that God doesn\u2019t cancel? Adam and Eve, canceled for eating some fruit, would like a word. Pharaoh, whose entire country was canceled via 10 horrific plagues, is calling on line two. God cancels people all the time, with extreme prejudice!\n\nAll this is front and center because late last week, \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d announced the hiring of stand-up comedian Shane Gillis. Then, after footage began to circulate of him mocking and slurring Chinese people on his podcast, and when the magazine Variety reported that he was widely known in comedy circles for his anti-gay and anti-Muslim language, SNL announced that he wouldn\u2019t be joining the cast after all.\n\nGillis tried to defend himself as a comic who \u201cpushes boundaries,\u201d and a host of other comedians rushed to his defense. Conservative (and a few liberal) media outlets convened panels to discuss whether \u201ccancel culture\u201d had gone too far. Even presidential candidate Andrew Yang chimed in with a message of support for Gillis.\n\nBut the arguments that critics of cancel culture make tell on themselves.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like there\u2019s a mutated McCarthy era, where any comic better watch anything they say,\u201d Sarah Silverman told the Los Angeles Times. Oh no, a public performer whose act is based on words is now forced to consider his own words. The horror.\n\n\u201cThis is just cancel culture. The guy shouldn\u2019t have been fired,\u201d declared stand-up comedian Jim Jefferies. \u201cAre we going to get rid of every sketch that SNL has done that involves race? I remember John Belushi dressing as an Asian man with a samurai sword. That was the whole sketch.\u201d\n\nSure, in 1975. Today, we generally agree that someone standing around in yellowface is not exactly the height of comedy. I\u2019m sorry Jefferies misses the good old days, but is it too much to ask for an ambitious young comedian to read the room? \u201cChinese people talk funny!\u201d is no longer daring comedy.\n\nOne suspects that many of those defending Gillis are worried that one day soon, they, too, might get tagged for trading in the same kind of lazy bigotry. At the heart of the anger over \u201ccancel culture\u201d is the fear that you might get canceled yourself \u2014 combined with the indignation that someone might ask you to change. But to make their griping seem noble \u2014 instead of just lazy \u2014 these anti-canceling crusaders declare that in fact it\u2019s the culture that\u2019s attacking them. Virtues like \u201caccountability\u201d and \u201ccourtesy\u201d are recast as \u201cauthoritarianism\u201d and \u201cgiving in to the mob.\u201d\n\nNot every \u201ccancellation\u201d is justified. We live in an unprecedented post-Internet moment: Most of us weren\u2019t expecting our past statements to be readily searchable at all times and might have been more thoughtful if we had. And I\u2019m not defending that woker-than-thou minority that really does exist, one which gangs up on others to highlight their own perfection. What used to be private reprimands now often take place in the public domain, and public dressing-downs rarely work as well as we would hope.\n\nBut social mores change, and so does humor. An accidental misstatement is one thing, a persona based on bigotry another. Condemning racism is just common decency. And at the end of the day, we would do well to note that most of the so-called victims of cancel culture are, in fact, totally fine.\n\nBilly Bush, \u201ccanceled\u201d after being caught giggling about pussy-grabbing with Donald Trump, is already hosting a new show. Roseanne Barr, literally canceled after a string of racist tweets last year, is still worth $80 million. Even Louis C.K., canceled in 2017 after accusations of sexual misconduct, is on tour again and selling out show after show. Gillis will be fine. A job rescinded by \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d is a setback, not \u2014 as comedian Rob Schneider would like us to think \u2014 an \u201cintolerable inquisition\u201d that is \u201cdestroying someone.\u201d In fact, due to new publicity in a polarized climate, Gillis\u2019sprofile will likely be much higher than before. I, personally, cannot wait until he\u2019s canceled into a Netflix comedy special. Dave Chappelle was never even canceled, but he\u2019s made complaining about \u201ccancel culture\u201d into the most profitable phase of his career.\n\nGod does cancel people, and society will survive if we sometimes do, too. Maybe Gillis can use his time on the outs to come up with some new jokes.\n\nRead more:\n\nSonny Bunch: Want comedy to change minds?
