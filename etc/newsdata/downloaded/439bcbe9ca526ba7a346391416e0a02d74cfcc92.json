CBS 2\u2019s Vince Gerasole went there to find out how racial tensions led to the frustration.\n\nThe avenues, parks, and people of Oak Park have had a reputation, for diversity and tolerance.\n\n\u201cOak Park buys into diversity, equity, and inclusion,\u201d said Trustee Dan Moroney.\n\n\u201cOak Park has a place for everybody,\u201d said Trustee Susan Buchanan.\n\nBut a Monday night a discussion on rewriting the village\u2019s diversity statement got heated over some specific words. Those words were: \u201cWe work to break down systems of oppression.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hesitate to send the message to our police department that they are a system of oppression,\u201d Moroney said in the meeting.\n\nMoroney clearly frustrated Buchanan.\n\n\u201cYou have been white from birth! Why are you arguing, what is a system of oppression? You have never experienced one!\u201d Buchanan said.\n\nShe raised her voice as she continued, at times to applause.\n\n\u201cYou have not spent a day with dark brown skin and tried to walk through this society!\u201d she said.\n\nWith a few days\u2019 perspective, Buchanan stepped back her tone as she spoke with CBS 2.\n\n\u201cI probably showed more emotion than I should have,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Buchanan stands by her message.\n\n\u201cI strongly believe that there is a time when white people, including myself, should stand back,\u201d she said.\n\nMoroney gave us perspective too.\n\n\u201cPeople of goodwill can have differences of opinion,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s OK to silence voices when at the heart, there is tremendous agreement.\u201d\n\nBut all this is happening where the Oak Park Board of Trustees admittedly is lacking in minority representation.\n\n\u201cThe reality is it\u2019s a diverse community, until you ask it to be diverse,\u201d said community activist Melanie McQueen.\n\nMcQueen serves on many Oak Park diversity boards.\n\n\u201cI think it unfair for people who are looking for equality to not give that opportunity of equality,\u201d she said.\n\nMcQueen said in working for needed change, the village needs everyone to come together.\n\n\u201cWe want it to be awesome for everyone \u2013 not for just one race,\u201d she said.\n\nThe diversity statement still includes the phrase \u201csystems of oppression, but goes on to define them as including biases such as racism, sexism, and homophobia.", "description": "A Board of Trustees meeting in Oak Park erupted in charged emotions and angry exchanges this week, all over race relations in the western suburbs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://chicago.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15116062/2019/10/Oak_Park_Board_Of_Trustees_1009.jpg?w=1214", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
