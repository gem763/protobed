At the height of the controversy, a senior news director at ESPN mandated that the network\u2019s coverage \u201cavoid any political discussions about China and Hong Kong,\u201d according to Deadspin\u2019s summary of a leaked memo \u2014 a shocking directive for the biggest political sports story of 2019. ESPN even broadcast a map that included Taiwan as part of China and a dotted line to represent China\u2019s disputed claims in the South China Sea. \u201cI\u2019ve literally never seen that map outside of China,\u201d tweeted Julian Ku, an expert on Chinese law. It was the most telling illustration yet of a major problem in U.S.-China relations.\n\nCriticism of China\u2019s unfair treatment of American companies has focused on technology transfers, state support of domestic businesses and intellectual-property theft. But Beijing doesn\u2019t just want foreign companies to advance its economic interests. It wants them to advance its political ones, too. In subtle and sophisticated ways, Beijing convinces, cajoles and cudgels American companies to promote the values of the ruling Chinese Communist Party, parrot the party\u2019s views and enshrine self-censorship about China in their corporate cultures. When it\u2019s successful, as with ESPN, the company advances Chinese propaganda.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne way American companies protect the party\u2019s view is by suppressing negative information; Morey did this when he deleted his tweet. So did Activision Blizzard, an American entertainment company that required a professional video gamer to forfeit $10,000 in prize money for shouting, \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\u201d in a post-match interview. Beijing does not want to weaken these companies or push them out of China. Instead, it wants them to follow the party\u2019s rules, both in China and globally. \u201cChina doesn\u2019t just want you to comply with its wishes,\u201d a Singaporean diplomat told a newspaper last year. It wants you to \u201cdo what it wants without being told.\u201d Although Tencent owns 5 percent of Activision Blizzard and ESPN owner Disney has worked closely to mollify the party for decades, it seems unlikely that any Chinese source told officials how to act or which map to use. They had internalized Beijing\u2019s demands.\n\nThe other way U.S. companies promote China\u2019s views is by amplifying positive information. In January 2018, Marriott sent guests an online survey that listed Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tibet, and Macau as countries, and a U.S.-based employee of the hotel chain liked a Twitter post about the nationhood of Tibet, a Chinese region where some citizens want independence. Beijing decided to make an example of Marriott \u2014 a company thriving in China, with more than 300 hotels there: It required Marriott to shut down all of its Chinese websites and apps for seven days. Sounding like a Chinese propaganda organ, the company announced that it didn\u2019t support \u201cseparatist groups that subvert the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China.\u201d Then, to amplify the positive, Marriott announced an \u201ceight-point rectification plan\u201d to \u201cregain confidence and trust.\u201d Part of the plan, according to the Hong Kong Free Press, included \u201cexpanding employee education globally\u201d \u2014 i.e., educating its staff on Chinese propaganda. A Versace statement this year was even more groveling. In August, after an outcry over a T-shirt that implied Hong Kong was independent, the luxury clothing brand affirmed that \u201cwe love China and resolutely respect the sovereignty of its territory.\u201d\n\nChinese Chairman Xi Jinping calls this \u201cdiscourse power\u201d \u2014 the ability to shape the narrative and \u201ctell China\u2019s story well.\u201d And foreign companies and their employees are excellent proxies for evangelizing China\u2019s position. In other words, while the United States excels in soft power, China wins in what we could call proxy power. When Chinese basketball star Yao Ming praises China, Americans expect it. When Houston Rockets star James Harden apologizes for his team and professes that \u201cwe love China\u201d and \u201ceverything there about them,\u201d that feels heartfelt. Though Harden\u2019s sentiments may be sincere, his contrition advances Beijing\u2019s propaganda goals.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSometimes, when China punishes a foreign company for violating unstated rules, no one bothers to explain how to rectify the crime. The Chinese sportswear firm Anta, for example, simply canceled contract negotiations with the NBA because the league\u2019s words were \u201cwrong.\u201d To restore their good standing, executives must supplicate, with minimal guidance from the party-state. \u201cThe NBA has been in cooperation with China for many years,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a Tuesday news conference. \u201cIt knows clearly in its heart what to say and what to do.\u201d\n\nOther times, Beijing has specific demands. In July 2018, China required global airlines in all their communications to stop implying that Taiwan was independent from the mainland. A United Airlines flight, for instance, now departs from \u201cSan Francisco, CA, US\u201d and lands simply in \u201cTaipei,\u201d orphaning Taiwan\u2019s capital. Now that no major international airlines refer to Taiwan as a country, it would be newsworthy if any of their employees, advertisements or affiliates said otherwise. It\u2019s much safer to self-censor than to risk a scandal that could cost revenue. One day in January 2018, China\u2019s Cyberspace Administration ordered the clothing retailer Zara and the world\u2019s largest medical device company, Medtronic, to post apologies by 6 p.m. that evening for labeling Taiwan as a separate country on their websites. It also demanded that the companies \u201cconduct a comprehensive self-examination\u201d to make sure there were no violations elsewhere on their sites. Both companies complied.\n\nIt\u2019s not a new phenomenon. \u201cIf you want to deal in China, you will sing their tune,\u201d James Lilley, American ambassador to China from 1989 to 1991, told the journalist John Judis in 1997. What has changed since Xi assumed power in 2012, and especially over the past few years, is that Beijing now has the confidence and the market heft to threaten convincingly. Its ultimatums terrify executives. China\u2019s gross domestic product surpassed $13 trillion in 2018 \u2014 a more-than-tenfold increase over 2000. Moreover, because self-abasement in China can carry reputational costs in the United States, corporations increasingly speak with a pro-Beijing message, so they don\u2019t have to look like they\u2019re caving when the party calls them out. No company wants a pummeling like the NBA is currently receiving from American politicians, columnists and fans.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBeijing doesn\u2019t force these companies to self-censor because it cannot tolerate dissent or because the party is so brittle that criticism would destroy it. Rather, it does so because it can. It\u2019s an effective public relations strategy, honed over decades, that co-opts some foreigners into facilitating the spread of Chinese propaganda. While there are risks of overplaying \u2014 a prolonged NBA scandal, for example, could cause Chinese fans to direct their anger not only at the league but at Beijing \u2014 it has succeeded in creating a coterie of Western chief executives petrified of offending Beijing.\n\nWill the NBA be one of the rare exceptions? In his statement, Commissioner Silver said, \u201cThe NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues.\u201d But just two days later, a Houston Rockets executive blocked a CNN reporter from asking about the China scandal. \u201cWe\u2019re taking basketball questions only,\u201d she said. That is discourse power.\n\nTwitter: @isaacstonefish\n\nAD", "description": "Corporations self-censor to protect themselves from the Communist Party\u2019s ire.", "authors": ["Isaac Stone Fish", "Isaac Stone Fish Is A Journalist", "A Contributing Columnist For Global Opinions.
