On the other end of the spectrum are the lackadaisical types, who leave a trail of 401(k) plans behind them with each jump to a new job.\n\nIn a recent survey by Financial Engines, a division of Edelman Financial Services, 42% of people who left their jobs didn\u2019t realize that leaving their money in their workplace plan was even an option. \u201cA very large portion of workers are unaware of all their options, and often make choices that expose them to risks, fees, and taxes that are otherwise avoidable,\u201d says founder Ric Edelman.\n\nHere are some common mistakes, from the most egregious to the more nuanced.\n\nSimply cashing out\n\nThere are plenty of ways employees can blow it on their retirement savings, but this is the biggest by far\u2014cashing out and not reinvesting the funds in a qualified retirement plan. In the Financial Engines survey, a third of respondents said they had withdrawn money prior to retirement, and 41% of them said they had no intention of putting the money back into a qualified account.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize the incredible cost to their financial security,\u201d says Edelman, noting that 28% of survey respondents said they weren\u2019t aware that cashing out would trigger taxes and penalties.\n\nThat cost includes the immediate tax hit\u2014income taxes, plus another 10% early withdrawal penalty if you are not yet age 59\u00bd. The longer-term issue is the lost tax-deferred compounding, even for a modest account balance: A $20,000 plan that averages a 6% annual return can grow to more than $120,000 over 30 years. Cash out at $20,000, though, and you owe federal, state, and local income taxes, plus a $2,000 penalty, which could ultimately mean you end up with just $10,000.\n\nRolling over too many times\n\nAmong employees who don\u2019t intend to cash out of their retirement account, mishaps can happen when they make the call to move their funds to another plan or an individual retirement account.\n\nEmployees who decide to move their money to another 401(k) plan or an IRA typically have two options\u2014transfer the funds directly to another account, or do a rollover. Although \u201crollover\u201d is a term widely used to mean moving money from one retirement account to another, the Internal Revenue Service has a narrow definition, says Edelman. That money is best moved from one institution directly to another in a direct transfer. However, \u201cif the employer sends you the check, that\u2019s a rollover,\u201d Edelman says. \u201cYou have 60 days to roll the money over to an IRA or another qualified plan.\u201d\n\nMany people understand that if they miss that window, they\u2019ll owe taxes and the 10% penalty. What they don\u2019t realize, however, is that this grace period is offered only once every 12 months. \u2018We\u2019ve seen people create traps for themselves because they move their retirement money more than once,\u201d Edelman says.\n\nIn most cases, the best bet is to check the transfer box. \u201cThey\u2019re simpler because the money is moved from institution to the other, and you don\u2019t have to worry about the IRS limit or losing the check,\u201d he says.\n\nAssuming an IRA is best\n\nThere are plenty of great reasons to move 401(k) money into an IRA. As the word \u201cindividual\u201d suggests, these accounts aren\u2019t linked to any one employer, and consolidating most of your retirement money into a single account is generally the easiest way to keep track of your retirement goals and asset-allocation decisions.\n\nThat said, this isn\u2019t something that people should do in haste. First of all, your old employer\u2019s 401(k) plan may offer you access to investment options, tools, and institutional pricing that you may not get with an IRA. In an analysis of in-plan fees, Edelman\u2019s firm found that employees who keep their retirement savings in a workplace plan versus opening a new IRA on their own could save more than $4,600 on a $100,000 balance over 10 years.\n\nSomething else to consider is that creditor protection of IRAs varies by state, and often isn\u2019t as strong as it is with a 401(k), says Dean Mioli, a Certified Financial Planner, certified public accountant, and director of Investment Planning at Independent Advisor Solutions by SEI. Although most people shouldn\u2019t let concerns about creditor protection influence their retirement planning, professionals in more litigious fields, such as medicine or construction, should factor this into the decision he says.\n\nOverlooking other tax strategies\n\nAlthough most people associate 401(k) plans with pretax contributions, there may be other strategies to consider when weighing a move. One option may be to convert the savings to a Roth IRA; you\u2019ll owe income taxes on what you convert, but future growth and withdrawals will be tax free. This is a particularly good strategy to consider in a year that your income may be lower, minimizing the tax hit.\n\nFor employees who\u2019ve accumulated their employer\u2019s stock in their 401(k) plans, leaving a job may open the door for an often overlooked tax break. Normally, distributions from a tax-deferred retirement account are taxed as ordinary income. Under the so-called \u201cnet unrealized appreciation\u201d break, you can opt to withdraw your employer\u2019s stock as shares. You\u2019ll owe ordinary income tax on the cost basis\u2014what they were worth when they entered your 401(k)\u2014but not on any gains. When you sell the shares down the road, you\u2019ll owe capital-gains tax just on the shares\u2019 appreciation\u2014which could lower your rate to zero or max out at 20% depending on your tax bracket.\n\n\u201cSome rollover actions cannot be reversed or remedied, so it\u2019s best to fully consider your options before making a decision,\u201d Mioli says, noting that changing jobs, like any major life transition, can stir up emotions and pave the way for bad decisions. \u201cTake a deep breath and make a rational decision under calmer times.\u201d", "description": "Don\u2019t clean out your 401(k) when you clean out your desk.
