Shanghai was 0.4 per cent higher and Tokyo ended the morning 0.1 per cent higher.\n\nSeoul added 0.4 per cent and Taipei rose 0.3 per cent but Sydney slipped 0.2 per cent and Singapore fell 0.1 per cent, while Wellington and Manila were also down.\n\nDealers are being given some optimism by the fact the US and China are about to restart trade negotiations next month, with a delegation from Beijing reportedly visiting Washington this week for preparatory talks.\n\nHowever, there are fresh worries about the impact on the already stuttering world economy from the Saudi oil attacks on Saturday.\n\nWhile the resumption of output from the world's biggest exporter provided some much-needed relief, observers said long-term energy security is now a concern.\n\n\"Restoring production may placate global investors' immediate economic concerns, but that's only half the problem as the attacks exposed some significant vulnerabilities,\" said Stephen Innes at AxiTrader.\n\n\"None more so than just how inadequately prepared the markets are for disruptions of this magnitude which suggest that the supply risk premium could stick around well after production is restored.\"\n\nEyes are on US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who departed for Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to discuss possible retaliation, while Vice-President Mike Pence said: \"As the president said, we don't want war with anybody but the United States is prepared.\"\n\nA US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP the White House has concluded the attack - claimed by Huthi rebels in Yemen - involved cruise missiles from Iran and that evidence would be presented at the UN General Assembly next week.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Stocks - [HONG KONG] Asian equities were mixed on Wednesday, with attention turning to the Federal Reserve's key policy decision later in the day, while investors remain on alert for developments in the Middle East after the attack on Saudi oil facilities rocked markets. .
