The administrators have found a number of \u2018highly suspicious transactions\u2019 to a small interconnected group of people who ended up with large sums of investors\u2019 money in their own personal coffers. Crucial Academy also employed Johnny Mercer for \u00a385,000,\u201d Watson wrote.\n\nIn the letter seen by the Guardian, he said both grants were associated with \u201cquestionable business practices\u201d and had connections to politicians.\n\n\u201cThis raises questions about the appropriate use of public funds and the due diligence systems in place,\u201d he said.\n\nMercer, a former army officer, stood down as a non-executive director at Crucial in June and was appointed as an executive director instead. He has maintained the same salary, despite becoming a defence minister.\n\nIn an email to the Guardian, Mercer said he did not know about the grant.\n\n\u201cI was proud of my work as a non-executive director for Crucial Academy \u2013 an exciting project facilitating veterans into cybersecurity after a career in the military,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the Guardian pointed out that he was still registered as a director at Companies House, Mercer said he would be stepping down from Crucial after discussing the job \u201cjust this week with the permanent secretary in the Ministry of Defence\u201d.\n\nA spokesman for Surge Financial said: \u201cAt no point did Surge ever touch a single penny of LCF bondholders\u2019 money. Surge is a third-party marketing company that was paid a fee for providing a range of services to LCF.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Crucial Academy said: \u201cDue process was followed in every grant application.\u201d\n\nArcuri, an American who moved to London seven years ago, was given \u00a3126,000 in public money and was treated to privileged access to three foreign trade missions led by Johnson while he was mayor of London.\n\nThe government has confirmed it has frozen a \u00a3100,000 grant to Hacker House, pending a review by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. The money, which was awarded earlier this year, was intended to foster digital skills in the UK.\n\nThe government\u2019s claim that it properly verified the grant appeared to be unravelling this week amid mounting evidence about the company\u2019s tenuous links to the UK.\n\nAfter a minister said necessary checks on the firm to ensure it was UK-based involved verifying it had \u201ca British phone number\u201d, the Guardian called the number and got through to a US-based member of staff who would not confirm her exact location.\n\nAccording to LinkedIn, only four of the 11 employees recorded on the site are located in the UK, and one of them is Arcuri, who moved to the US last year.", "description": "Call for investigation into \u00a368,000 awarded to company that employs Johnny Mercer", "authors": ["Rajeev Syal"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10b7d94a7ffe12f45caedeef8e77e5620b50ef3c/0_131_2254_1351/master/2254.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1d21a9532bff4f629eed0fd527bfc727", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
