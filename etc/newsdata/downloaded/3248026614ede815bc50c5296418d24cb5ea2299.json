One of his most senior ministers said Britain would still leave the bloc on Oct. 31.\n\n\u201cWe are going to leave by October 31. We have the means and the ability to do so,\u201d Michael Gove, the minister in charge of no-deal Brexit preparations, told Sky News.\n\n\u201cThat letter was sent because parliament required it to be sent ... but parliament can\u2019t change the prime minister\u2019s mind, parliament can\u2019t change the government\u2019s policy or determination.\u201d\n\nIn yet another twist to the running Brexit drama, Johnson sent three letters to Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council.\n\nFirst, a brief cover note from Britain\u2019s EU envoy explaining that the government was simply complying with the law; second, an unsigned copy of the text that the law, known as the Benn Act, forced him to write; and a third letter in which Johnson said he did not want an extension.\n\n\u201cI have made clear since becoming Prime Minister and made clear to parliament again today, my view, and the Government\u2019s position, that a further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners, and the relationship between us,\u201d Johnson said in the third letter, signed \u201cBoris Johnson\u201d.\n\nThe EU, which has grappled with the tortuous Brexit crisis since Britons voted 52%-48% to leave in a 2016 referendum, was clearly bewildered by the contradictory signals from London.\n\nTusk said he had received the request from Johnson and would start consulting EU leaders on how to react.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron told Johnson that Paris needed swift clarification on the situation after Saturday\u2019s vote, an official at the French presidency told Reuters.\n\n\u201cHe (Macron) signalled a delay would be in no one\u2019s interest,\u201d the official said.\n\nIt was unlikely that the EU\u2019s 27 remaining member states would refuse Britain\u2019s request, given the impact on all parties of a no-deal Brexit. Diplomats said on Sunday the bloc would play for time rather than rush to decide, waiting to see how things developed in London.\n\nGove said the risk of no deal had increased and the government would step up preparations for it, including triggering its \u201cOperation Yellowhammer\u201d contingency plans.\n\n\u201cWe cannot guarantee that the European Council will grant an extension,\u201d he said, adding that he would chair a meeting on Sunday \u201cto ensure that the next stage of our exit preparations, our preparedness for a no deal, is accelerated\u201d.\n\nBREXIT LAW\n\nJohnson won the top job by staking his career on getting Brexit done by Oct. 31 after his predecessor, Theresa May, was forced to delay the departure date twice. Parliament rejected her deal three times, by margins of between 58 and 230 votes.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson leaves Downing Street to head for the House of Commons as parliament discusses Brexit, sitting on a Saturday for the first time since the 1982 Falklands War, in London, Britain, October 19, 2019. REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nHe had hoped to pass his own newly struck deal at an extraordinary sitting of parliament on Saturday but that was derailed by a legislative booby trap set by a rebel lawmaker concerned that Britain might still drop out without a deal.\n\nLawmakers voted 322 to 306 in favour of an amendment that called for the legislation around the withdrawal deal to be approved first. This turned Johnson\u2019s planned finale on its head by obliging him to ask the EU for a delay, and increasing the opportunity for opponents to frustrate Brexit.\n\nIn his own signed letter to Tusk, Johnson said he was confident that the process of getting the legislation through Britain\u2019s parliament would be completed before Oct. 31.\n\nFormer minister Amber Rudd said she and most of the 21 Conservatives kicked out of the ruling party over their bid to block a no-deal Brexit would support the deal and there was \u201ca fragile but sincere coalition of people who want to support it\u201d.\n\nOliver Letwin, the lawmaker behind Saturday\u2019s amendment, said on Sunday that he believed Johnson could probably get his Brexit deal over the line.\n\n\u201cI am absolutely behind the government now as long as they continue with this bill, continue with the deal. I will support it, I will vote for it,\u201d Letwin told BBC television.\n\n\u2018CHILDLIKE\u2019\n\nBut the opposition Labour Party accused Johnson of acting as if he was above the law, and said the prime minister could end up in court.\n\nLabour\u2019s Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer said the party would put forward amendments to Johnson\u2019s Brexit legislation, particularly aimed at closing the \u201ctrap door\u201d to a no-deal Brexit kicking in at the end of a transition period in December 2020.\n\n\u201cHe is being childlike. The law is very clear he should have signed one letter ... If we crash out, because of what he has done with the letters, in 11 days\u2019 time without a deal he bears personal responsibility for that,\u201d Starmer told BBC television.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks ahead of a vote on his renegotiated Brexit deal, on what has been dubbed \"Super Saturday\", in the House of Commons in London, Britain October 19, 2019. \u00a9UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor/Handout via REUTERS\n\nAsked whether it would end up in court, Starmer said: \u201cI am sure there will be court proceedings.\u201d\n\nScotland\u2019s highest court is due to consider on Monday a legal challenge that had sought to force Johnson to comply with the Benn Act. Under that law, Johnson was obliged to write to the EU seeking a delay if parliament had not approved either a withdrawal deal or a no-deal exit by Oct. 19.\n\nThe court said earlier this month that government lawyers had given formal legal statements that he would abide by the law and that it would be a serious matter if he did not.\n\nStarmer also said an election was inevitable.", "description": "The British government insisted on Sunday the country will leave the European Union on Oct. 31 despite a letter that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was forced by parliament to send to the bloc requesting a Brexit delay.", "authors": ["Kylie Maclellan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1442845125&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I0MV", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
