One judge didn\u2019t see it that way, though, scoring the fight against him for the split decision.\n\nThe Brazilian\u2019s manager, Alex Davis, on Sunday told MMA Junkie that plans are in place to file an appeal looking into the judge who scored the fight for Jumeau. The ideal outcome would be to have the result overturned to a unanimous decision.\n\n\u201cAlthough Dhiego won, we have decided to appeal this decision,\u201d Davis told MMA Junkie. \u201cWe are asking that it be changed from split to unanimous on a question of principle. Although we are happy with Dhiego\u2019s win, we are intrigued at how a judge could have scored the fight for Jumeau. No disrespect to Jumeau \u2013 he fought a tough fight. But a split decision does not reflect the reality of the fight.\n\n\u201cOnce again, this exposes a fundamental flaw in MMA judging and structure. The question again looms: Who are these people? What are their credentials? How did they get into such an important position, as to judge fights that affect these hard-working athletes\u2019 lives and careers?\u201d\n\nUFC 243 was regulated by the Victoria Sport and Recreation board. Davis plans to bring the appeal to that sanctioning body, but a change in result under these circumstances might be unprecedented.\n\nLima, who extended his winning streak to three fights with the victory over Jumeau, appears to have grounds for the appeal, though. According to MMADecisions.com, which serves as a database for official and media scorecards, the three judges sitting cageside saw a vastly different fight than outsiders did (via Twitter):\n\nThe 3 cageside judges collectively scored 4 of 9 scored rounds for Jumeau. The 18 media scorers on our site collectively gave 1 of 54 scored rounds to Jumeau. \u2014 MMADecisions.com (@MMADecisions) October 6, 2019\n\nDavis said he\u2019s uncertain how this situation will play out, but after filing an appeal on Edson Barboza\u2019s split-decision loss to Paul Felder at UFC 242 in September, he thinks it\u2019s important to continue pressing the issue.\n\n\u201cThese questions cannot stop being asked,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThese decisions must be confronted for a better MMA.\u201d", "description": "Dhiego Lima's team is not satisfied with his split decision win over Luke Jumeau at UFC 243.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "John Morgan", "Blue Corner", "Matt Erickson", "Ken Hathaway", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Abbey Subhan", "Simon Head"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/dhiego-lima-luke-jumeau-ufc-243-11.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
