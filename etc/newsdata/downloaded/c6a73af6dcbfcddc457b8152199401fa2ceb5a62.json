Capital, though, has pencilled in revenues of between $25-30millionin the first year, all of which will be incremental to the projections for this year.\n\nGold's recent jump to a five year high has provided a welcome boost to the sector's miners\n\nAllied Gold has arranged a $75million facility with Orion Mine Finance to cover the cost of Bonikro's development and the possible acquisition of other mines as well.\n\nGiven their existing relationship, it seems a fair assumption that will throw up more opportunities to work with Allied Gold in future.\n\nBoyton is excited by the possibility. Allied already has a sizeable gold property in Ethiopia and is actively looking at other projects. 'It has a fantastic pipeline,' says Boyton.\n\nTo cement the relationship, Capital will take a 3 per cent stake in Allied Gold once the broader terms of the contract are finalised.\n\nHouse broker Peel Hunt believes the scope of the Bonikro deal opens a much larger range of potential clients across Africa than drilling services alone.\n\nCapital works for many of the large mining firms in East Africa already and there is seemingly lots of potential to increase how much it does for these companies as the size of contracts it handles become larger.\n\nBefore last week, the broker was forecasting underlying profits of US$30million in 2020 but expects now to make material upgrades to its forecasts both for that year and beyond.\n\nAt 65p the shares yield a prospective 3.4 per cent with the company overall valued at \u00a389million, which might arguably have been justified before the Bonikro deal but now looks like an opportunity.", "description": "FTSE Fledgling member Capital Drilling supplies rigs and drills under contract to miners in East and West Africa.", "authors": ["Philip Whiterow", "Proactive Investors", "For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
