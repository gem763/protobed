Is it any wonder mistakes are made.\u201d\n\nAn ex-chair of the Royal College of GPs, Dr Gerada is calling for a maximum eight-hour day.\n\nShe said the Government had to \u201cfind ways of looking after the people who look after the patients\u201d.\n\nOf 3,000 NHS practitioners receiving mental help from her programme, 1,855 are now GPs\n\nRoyal College of GPs chair Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard said the programme was a \u201clifeline to doctors who are struggling\u201d and \u201cmade it acceptable to ask for help before we crash and burn\u201d.\n\n(Image: Mark Thomas/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nShe said the Government needed to look beyond \u201cvote winning gimmicks\u201d and recruit more GPs.\n\nThe revelations come as the Sunday Mirror\u2019s End The GPs Crisis campaign calls for funding for at least 5,000 trainee doctors a year to replace 1,600 places axed by the Tories.\n\nTwo weeks ago we revealed thousands of patients are being limited to just FIVE minutes with their GP.\n\nA Department of Health spokesman said GP trainees had \u201cincreased for the fifth year in a row\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re backing primary and community care with an extra \u00a34.5 billion by 2023/24, and are working hard to recruit and retain more family doctors.\u201d\n\nInches from saw suicide\n\nA senior GP has told how he was nearly driven to suicide by his surgery workload.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nJoe McGilligan came close to killing himself with a chainsaw while cutting logs.
