The recovery is possible because much of the discarded gold slag dates far back into Johannesburg\u2019s history as a mining town.\n\nIn the old days, gold extraction techniques were not as effective as today. It\u2019s worth dwelling on this point: The recovery margins are unbelievably slender, yet \u2013 if the technology is right \u2013 profitable.\n\nDRDGold\u2019s Ergo operations (short for East Rand Gold Operations), for instance, yield 0.2 of a gram of gold for every tonne of rock processed. And that\u2019s when the technology is working particularly well, as was the case in the firm\u2019s 2019 financial year.\n\n\u201cOur expertise is rare. We have a team that knows exactly how to extract the gold from many years of experience,\u201d says Pretorius. That\u2019s one of the reasons Sibanye-Stillwater, the gold and platinum producer, was moved to buy a 38% stake in DRDGold last year in return for its West Rand gold dumps, now known in DRDGold\u2019s portfolio as Far West Gold Recoveries (FWGR).\n\nPretorius was heavily criticised for doing the deal, even though by incorporating FWGR it significantly expanded DRDGold\u2019s footprint and life of mine. Analysts were critical of the fact that Pretorius both parted with such a large number of shares, and because he granted Sibanye-Stillwater the option of taking 50.01% control in DRDGold.\n\nThe control option expires in February, so expect Sibanye-Stillwater to make its move before long. finweek has previously quoted James Wellsted, head of investor relations for Sibanye-Stillwater, as saying: \u201cWe are already consolidating DRDGold\u2019s numbers in our published results.\u201d\n\nAccording to Wellsted, the takeover of DRDGold is pretty much a given. The view of Pretorius, however, is that little will change on the ground. \u201cThe last I heard of Sibanye-Stillwater\u2019s plans is that they see DRDGold as an investment,\u201d he says.\n\nThere\u2019s no plan to shut down the brand which, if it happened, would be a shame. DRDGold is the oldest listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, dating back to the founding of the bourse.\n\nThe Durban Roodepoort Deep mine, which gives DRDGold its modern-day name, was one of the first gold mines in the city. It operated for over a hundred years and, before it eventually closed, it was one of the building blocks for the Kebble family fortune that played out so calamitously and spectacularly under the hand of the late Brett Kebble.\n\nEven then, the late Roger Kebble saw in DRDGold both a gold and a property company, says Pretorius. Today, the taking down of the gold dumps is not only an environmental boon \u2013 dust blown from the dumps to nearby communities has been a bone of contention for years \u2013 but it also means the \u2018creation\u2019 of new real estate, the land on which the dumped gold stood.\n\n\u201cWe have communities living near the dumps that we would like to see benefit from when we\u2019ve finished. At the moment, the land is not very valuable; but when it\u2019s cleared, it will become tradeable real estate and we\u2019d like to see something good come out of it,\u201d he says.\n\nDRDGold said at its annual results presentation in September that it had received clearance for the redevelopment of just over 135 hectares of property. Pretorius is hoping the government will see in the company the solution to the problem of remnant mining, not the cause.\n\nIn the meantime, Pretorius is working on the commissioning of the first phase of FWGR, which will provide much-needed diversity to the current single-asset Ergo base. There\u2019s also early work on a phase two section and with a strong partner in tow, the prospect of more corporate activity down the road.\n\nOne possibility is that Sibanye-Stillwater may bid for the assets of AngloGold Ashanti\u2019s Mponeng and Mine Waste Solution assets, the latter of which would fall squarely in DRDGold\u2019s lap were the deal to happen. Asked about the possibility, Pretorius said the canvas was much wider than a single company\u2019s assets.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why DRDGold wouldn\u2019t have a much broader scope for expansion beyond that,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have a very strong partner in Sibanye-Stillwater and there\u2019s the possibility we could reprocess gold dumps across the east, west and central parts of Johannesburg.\u201d\n\nThe way Wellsted sees it, DRDGold could also become the vehicle for retreatment of other metals, not just gold. That, however, is a far-away prospect not currently under serious consideration. But it is worth remarking that Sibanye-Stillwater is now the world\u2019s largest platinum producer, with significant resources and dumps.\n\nPretorius wasn\u2019t a natural shoo-in as gold operator. Rather than toiling underground, he earned his stripes in the more hushed ambience of legal chambers. In fact, he was dead set on becoming an advocate, an ambition he has said in the past is not entirely diminished. \u201cI was employed as legal counsel to DRDGold and eventually became its CEO,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIf I found that Sibanye-Stillwater didn\u2019t have any need for me, I\u2019d push off fairly quickly,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I love the job.\u201dThe company does seem to be a calling; even its shareholders are craven to the share, lured by its history as a famed \u2018marginal gold play\u2019. Mark Wellesley-Wood, a former CEO who passed away earlier this year, referred to the company as \u2018The Roodepoort Rocket\u2019.\n\nHe revelled in styling the company the go-to stock if you believed the gold price would explode (positively), and you wanted to become an instant millionaire. (During the early 2000s, when he was CEO, he tapped into a pocket of shareholders who were gold price conspiracists, the philosophical brethren of survivalists who live in constant fear of cataclysm.)\n\nThis led to all sorts of derogatory headlines when the gold price didn\u2019t endlessly increase in value, all playing on the rocket theme. Now, however, the gold price really is taking off. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had it so good,\u201d says Pretorius of the current rand gold price. It\u2019s some R150 000 per kilogram of gold produced better than its average during DRDGold\u2019s 2019 financial year.\n\nThe company ended the year with R170m in cash and paid another dividend \u2013 it has been a regular dividend payer for years \u2013 but at the current gold price, the outlook is extremely positive, especially as Pretorius doesn\u2019t believe the rand is going to strengthen against the dollar, while the macroeconomic picture will continue to be supportive of the dollar gold price.\n\nEven DRDGold\u2019s financial director, Riaan Davel, was moved to a line in hyperbole that the colourful Wellesley-Wood would have approved. \u201cWith some R170m in net cash, we are in a really, really happy place at the moment,\u201d said Davel.\n\n\u201cThis looks like a launchpad. A rocket launchpad even for the Roodepoort Rocket to fly again, and much farther than before.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in the 10 October edition of finweek magazine.
