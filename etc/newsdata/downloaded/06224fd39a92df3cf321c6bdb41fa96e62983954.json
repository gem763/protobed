A decision is expected early next year.\n\n\"We knew this was going to come,\" Andreas Hakansson, banking analyst at Danske bank said.\n\n\"A big fine is clearly priced into the valuation of Swedbank, but how big it's going to be from the Swedish FSA or how big it will be from the U.S, we don't know.\"\n\nThe maximum fine that the Swedish FSA can impose is 10% of annual group revenue. Investors are also watching two ongoing investigations from U.S. authorities.\n\nSwedbank has lost around 40% of its market value since its Estonian business was caught up in the money laundering allegations that have engulfed Danish rival Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO>.\n\nSwedbank's shares were down 3.58% at 1214 GMT, underperforming the European banking index <.SX7P>, which was down 0.59%.\n\nEstonia's watchdog issued a similar statement on Tuesday about Swedbank's Estonian subsidiary.\n\nSweden's oldest retail bank dismissed its CEO over the handling of the scandal and accepted the resignation of its chairman earlier this year.\n\nSwedbank is alleged to have processed suspect gross transactions of up to 20 billion euros ($22 billion) a year from mostly Russian non-residents through Estonia from 2010 to 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Additional reporting by Tarmo Virki and Johannes Hellstrom; editing by Jason Neely and Jane Merriman)", "description": "Swedish and Estonian financial regulators have taken their investigations into Swedbank  over anti-money laundering controls at its Baltic operations to the next level, they said on Tuesday, marking a formal step in the process that could lead to a financial penalty.
