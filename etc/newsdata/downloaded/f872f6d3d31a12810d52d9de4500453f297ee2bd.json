Repeat offenders can be punished with up to six months in prison and/or a fine of $200.\n\nThe proposal has prompted ridicule among the state's Republican Party, which mockingly congratulated Democrats for \"fearlessly taking on the biggest problems\" facing the country.", "description": "Calling someone a 'bitch' in Massachusetts could lead to a six-month jail term and a hefty fine, under legislation proposed by a Democrat lawmaker in the state this week.", "authors": ["Rozina Sabur", "Rupert Christiansen", "Allister Heath"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/23/TELEMMGLPICT000213919640-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
