On Saturday, Labour\u2019s Brexit spokesman, Keir Starmer, accused him of whipping up fears of rioting and deaths on the streets if Brexit is not delivered by 31 October so he could seek to invoke emergency powers and avoid extending the UK\u2019s EU membership beyond that date.\n\nWith the conference opening in Manchester on Sunday, Johnson said the government was embarking on \u201cthe biggest hospital building programme in a generation\u201d.\n\nIn an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, he said spending on the NHS was \u201cabsolutely central\u201d to his vision of a \u201cunited society and a united country\u201d.\n\nJohnson \u2018whipping up riot fears to avoid Brexit extension\u2019 Read more\n\nUnder the plans drawn up by health secretary Matt Hancock, he said they would be spending \u00a313bn on what officials described as \u201cnew\u201d hospitals; either with entirely new buildings or gutting existing structures to create state-of-the-art facilities.\n\nTaken alongside the extra \u00a333.9bn the government has committed to the NHS each year by 2023, he claimed it was \u201cthe largest sum that has ever been invested in the NHS\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re launching the biggest hospital building programme in a generation. You will have seen that on the steps of Downing Street I announced 20 new hospital upgrades.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now following that up with 40 new hospitals we\u2019re going to be doing across the country. It\u2019s the biggest programme of hospital building in a generation.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the prime minister was referred to the police complaints body to assess whether he should face a criminal investigation over his links to entrepreneur Arcuri.\n\nMichel Barnier: Boris Johnson\u2019s behaviour has \u2018limited the chance\u2019 of a Brexit deal Read more\n\nArcuri loaned more than \u00a3700,000 to her own fledgling technology company shortly before it won a \u00a3100,000 government grant. It is unclear where the money channelled to Hacker House, a start-up with hardly any income, came from.\n\nJohnson has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to his links to Arcuri.\n\nAnnouncing his hospitals plan, Johnson said it would begin with a \u00a32.7bn cash injection for six hospitals over the next five years. The remaining projects, including up to a dozen smaller rural hospitals, would be completed over the second half of the next decade.\n\nMinisters are also providing \u00a3100m in \u201cseed funding\u201d to help 21 trusts develop plans to rebuild or construct 34 hospitals, including up to a dozen community hospitals in Dorset.\n\nFollowing the supreme court ruling his suspension of Parliament was unlawful, the prime minister offered support for a suggestion by attorney general Geoffrey Cox that in future justices may need to undergo a US-style vetting by politicians.\n\n\u201cI think, if judges are to pronounce on political questions in this way, then there is at least an argument that there should be some form of accountability,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lessons of America are relevant.\u201d\n\nJohnson arrived in Manchester for a conference which faces being overshadowed by moves to oust him at Westminster. He refused to answer questions about his political and personal battles as he arrived with girlfriend Carrie Symonds at the Midland Hotel.\n\nA small group of protesters gathered outside the ring of steel that surrounds the conference venue, and their anti-Brexit cries could be heard as Johnson got out of his ministerial Jaguar. \u201cBoris is a liar\u201d and \u201cget your Johnson out of our democracy\u201d were among the slogans chanted by the demonstrators.\n\nA senior SNP MP said the opposition parties could stage a vote of no-confidence in the government as early as next week in a bid to install a caretaker leader who would secure an extension to the Brexit deadline.\n\nLabour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn is expected to convene another meeting of opposition leaders in Westminster on Monday aimed at preventing a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Speaking to reporters at a rally in Chingford, Essex, Corbyn said he stood ready to lead an interim government if Johnson was forced from No 10.\n\nPress Association contributed to this report", "description": "PM unveils plans for 40 new hospitals as Arcuri saga and Brexit threaten to overshadow Manchester conference", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/000a0d3f1571851e7b8d330405e5248d6ed0620a/0_0_4519_2712/master/4519.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ca456936d008a5370b5f3be2530f799b", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
