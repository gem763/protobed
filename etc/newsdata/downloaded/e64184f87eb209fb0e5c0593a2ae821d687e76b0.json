Nvidia Corp , Intel Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc gained 1.5%, while Apple Inc was up 1.2%.\n\nThe reports offered some relief to investors after a turbulent start to October as a result of escalating trade tensions, intensifying efforts to impeach President Donald Trump and signs of slowing economic growth.\n\nBets of a third interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve have surged since last week after data showed a sharp contraction in U.S. manufacturing and a dismal reading on business activity.\n\nOn Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell flagged openness to further rate cuts, repeating that the central bank will act \"as appropriate\" amid an economy that he said was likely to continue to expand.\n\nInvestors are now focused on the third-quarter earnings season, with analysts expecting the worst quarterly profit performance since 2016.\n\nEarnings for S&P 500 companies are forecast to fall nearly 3% from a year earlier, based on IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nAt 7:21 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 205 points, or 0.78%.
