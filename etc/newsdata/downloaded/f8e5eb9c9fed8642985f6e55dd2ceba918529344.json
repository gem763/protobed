So Trump was either watching the program, which airs at 10:00 PM ET, live or was informed that while Rice was plugging her new book, she was also critical of his recent decisions in Syria.\n\nJust as the program ended, Trump took to Twitter and blasted Rice, writing, \u201cSusan Rice, who was a disaster to President Obama as National Security Advisor, is now telling us her opinion on what to do in Syria. Remember RED LINE IN THE SAND? That was Obama. Millions killed! No thanks Susan, you were a disaster.\u201d\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nSusan Rice, who was a disaster to President Obama as National Security Advisor, is now telling us her opinion on what to do in Syria. Remember RED LINE IN THE SAND? That was Obama. Millions killed! No thanks Susan, you were a disaster. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 19, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nRice, as she showed during the Maher interview, was sharp and ready to retort the president\u2019s criticism. Only minutes after Trump\u2019s tweet, Rice took to Twitter herself and slammed the president for not only his hypocrisy but also for an unwanted hug during the 2015 White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner that she called \u201ctotally gross.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why did you come up and hug me at 2015 WHCD when I\u2019d never met you (which was totally gross) and whisper in my ear that I had been \u2018very unfairly treated\u2019 over Benghazi and \u2018was doing a great job for the country\u2019?\u201d Rice wrote.\n\nThen why did you come up and hug me at 2015 WHCD when I\u2019d never met you (which was totally gross) and whisper in my ear that I had been \u201cvery unfairly treated\u201d over Benghazi and \u201cwas doing a great job for the country\u201d? https://t.co/HG3SU2gfrE \u2014 Susan Rice (@AmbassadorRice) October 19, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the show, Maher asked Rice where the situation with Turkey, Syria and Kurds is heading, and she answered, \u201cIt\u2019s going nowhere good.\u201d\n\nRice continued, \u201cWhat Trump has done in Iraq, and now Syria, is, in effect, cede a portion of northern Syria, Kurdish homeland, to the Turks. And to evacuate the Americans as if it\u2019s, you know, his Saigon. We\u2019ve left our Turkish allies homeless. They\u2019re now going to scatter throughout the region.\u201d\n\nRice said Trump\u2019s actions in Syria worked in ways that would benefit those who are not friendly to America. \u201cWe\u2019ve given Assad and Putin and the Iranians a green light to take over that territory that they\u2019ve been long wanting to take. And ISIS is going to come back,\u201d Rice warned.\n\nWith a steady stream of scandals now surrounding this president, his heightened awareness of all things said about him seems to show his growing insecurity. In comparison to the other criticism Trump takes on a daily basis, this Rice interview was rather tame. Yet, Trump could not help himself. He lashed out, as he so often does, and Rice was ready with a response that brought back into focus a topic that gets lost because of all his never-ending White House controversies \u2014 the president of the United States is a creeper.\n\nBest of Rolling Stone\n\nSee where your favorite artists and songs rank on the Rolling Stone Charts.\n\n\n\nSign up for Rolling Stone\u2019s Newsletter.
