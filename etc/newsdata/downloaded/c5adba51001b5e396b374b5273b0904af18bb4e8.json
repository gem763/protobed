Google says it\u2019s aware of the issue, and is working on it.\n\nSo what\u2019s going on here?\n\nAt some point, Google Calendar picked up a feature that automatically adds right onto your calendar any event you\u2019re invited to, presumably to keep the invite from getting lost in your inbox. The problem: There doesn\u2019t seem to be much of a filter. If a bot gets your email address and throws it on an invite which gets past Google\u2019s anti-spam system, bam \u2014 it\u2019s on your calendar as if you added it yourself.\n\nGoogle\u2019s acknowledgement of the issue, first spotted by Engadget, comes in the form of a pinned post on the Google Calendar support forum. It reads, simply:\n\nWe\u2019re aware of the spam occurring in Calendar and are working diligently to resolve this issue. We\u2019ll post updates to this thread as they become available. Learn how to report and remove spam. Thank you for your patience.\n\nIn the meantime: If your calendar is filled with repeating spam events, you should be able to remove them in batches by going to Google Calendar on your computer, clicking one of the recurring spam events in question, clicking the three-dot button near the top right of the pop up, and hitting \u201cReport as spam\u201d.\n\nYou also can outright disable the feature that is auto-adding invites to your calendar until Google figures out a better way to keep spammers out.\n\nTo disable the \u201cautomatically add invite\u201d function:\n\nGo to Google Calendar on your computer\n\nClick the cog in the upper right, then hit settings\n\nOn the list on the left, click \u201cEvent settings\u201d\n\nLook for the \u201cAutomatically add invitations\u201d option. Change this to \u201cNo, only show invitations to which I have responded\u201d", "description": "Spam calendar invitations are driving many people nuts.", "authors": ["Greg Kumparak"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6fd8952400004f0073e71c.png?ops=1778_1000"}
