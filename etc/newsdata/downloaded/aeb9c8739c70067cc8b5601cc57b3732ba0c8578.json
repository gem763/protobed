Italy is the cheapest country overall, boasting four resorts in the best value top five\n\nA one week's ski holiday for a family of four costs \u00a31,530 in Bansko, in comparison to \u00a31,622 in Bardonecchia - which saw a 9.8 per cent rise placing it in second position.\n\nBardonecchia is one of four Italian resorts that dominate the top spots in the Family Ski Resort Report.\n\nSestriere (\u00a31,725) is in third place, along with Passo Tonale in fourth (\u00a31,736) and Claviere in fifth (\u00a31,759). La Thuile (\u00a32,075) also features in the top 10.\n\nThe ranking was revealed in the annual Post Office Travel Money Family Ski Resort report, which is produced with Crystal Ski Holidays\n\nWhile two Austrian ski resorts \u2013 Ellmau (\u00a31,858, 7th place) and Rauris (\u00a31,943, 8th place) \u2013 join Arinsal, Andorra (\u00a31969, 9th place) in the best value top 10.\n\nBy contrast, none of the seven French resorts surveyed have made it into the leading 10 resorts.\n\nTigne, surveyed for the first time, was most expensive of the seven new additions at \u00a32,547, while Morzine (\u00a32,089) was highest-placed in 11th position and benefited from a four per cent price drop.\n\nIt was one of five other resorts surveyed this year where prices have fallen: Ruka (Finland), Les Deux Alpes (France), Saas Fee (Switzerland), Cervinia (Italy) and Bansko (Bulgaria).\n\nTo compile the list, researchers compared the cost of six days' ski and boot hire, lift passes and ski school plus lunch and drinks for two adults and two children for the same number of days to give a realistic view of what it will cost a family of four on a one week holiday\n\nAlthough there have been year-on-year price rises in 10 resorts, only two saw percentage increases in double digits.\n\nPrices have risen by 11 per cent in Grindelwald (\u00a32,773, 23rd place), while Kranjska Gora (\u00a31,830), previously rated cheapest in the 2016 Family Ski Resort Report, has fallen to sixth place this season after registering the biggest increase of 11.8 per cent.\n\nThis is because tuition costs in the Slovenian resort have been very low in the past but have risen from \u00a3355 last year to \u00a3527 after ski school hours were extended from two to three hours.\n\nThe most expensive ski resorts proved to be Kitzb\u00fchel (\u00a32,817, 24th place) and Saas Fee (\u00a32,902, 25th place), with prices close to twice as high as in Bansko.\n\nThe most expensive ski resorts proved to be Kitzb\u00fchel and Saas Fee, with prices close to twice as high as in Bansko\n\nNick Boden, head of Post Office Travel Money, said: 'While Bansko offers unbeatable value overall for families on a tight budget, resorts in the Italian Alps are a great choice for a pound-stretching ski holiday. With few exceptions, we found that Italian ski resorts were cheaper than in Austria, France or Switzerland.\n\n'It is also worth noting that some ski essentials are cheaper in Italian resorts than in Bansko. For example, a week's family ski lift pass costs less in Bardonecchia, Sestriere and Claviere, while ski and boot hire is cheaper in Passo Tonale. It all depends on what you need to pay out for.'\n\nHe added: 'Families planning to take a ski holiday are most likely to do so in the school holidays at Christmas or half term so now is the time when they will be choosing where to ski. With price falls in some resorts and limited increases in others, it will pay to do some homework before booking to find the best value and it is also worth considering whether to switch to cheaper options in Italy and Eastern Europe. Another money-saving option could be to avoid half term and plan an Easter break instead.'", "description": "The ranking of the cheapest spots for family skiing this winter has been revealed in the Post Office Travel Money Family Ski Resort report.", "authors": ["Samantha Lewis For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/10/19581400-0-image-a-20_1570787361198.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
