White House Counsel Pat Cipolline wrote on Tuesday to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats that the administration would refuse to cooperate with what it called an \u201cillegitimate\u201d and \u201cunconstitutional\u201d impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThe effort to impeach President Trump ... is a naked political strategy that began the day he was inaugurated,\u201d Cipolline\u2019s letter added.\n\nPelosi said in response to the letter: \u201cMr. President, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable.\u201d She did not indicate what steps, if any, House Democrats might take to compel Trump\u2019s cooperation.\n\nIn addition to the whistleblower, lawmakers aim to hear later this week from a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, whom Trump removed from that post last May before her term was up.\n\nLawyers for the whistleblower were focused on how to protect the person\u2019s identity from being made public during any testimony, according to sources close to the talks.\n\nWith a portrait of former U.S. President Andrew Jackson hanging in the background, U.S. President Donald Trump speaks as he awards the Presidential Medal of Freedom to former Attorney General Edwin Meese in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, October 8, 2019. REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nThe showdown between Trump and Pelosi heightened just as a newly released Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Democratic support rising for impeachment. At the same time, 45 percent of all adult Americans said they support impeachment while 39 percent oppose it, unchanged from last week.\n\nRELATIONS RAW\n\nRelations between Democrats and Republicans in Congress were already raw when the State Department on Tuesday ordered U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, a major Trump political donor, not to appear at a closed-door meeting of three U.S. House panels investigating Trump.\n\nDemocrats view Sondland as a key witness who could help shed light on whether Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine as part of an effort to pressure it to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who had business dealings in Ukraine. Trump has alleged corruption by the Bidens, but has not provided any evidence to back that up.\n\nThe move prompted Democrats to accuse Trump of obstructing their investigation and Republicans to accuse Democrats of operating a secretive, biased inquiry.\n\nThe hot rhetoric in the high-stakes battle between Trump and Democrats who control the House is expected to intensify next week when Congress returns from a two-week recess.\n\nOn their return, members will huddle privately to discuss strategy if Pelosi decides in coming weeks or months to go ahead with articles of impeachment against Trump.\n\nRepublican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he would have no choice but to initiate a Senate trial on whether to convict Trump of any formal charges of \u201chigh crimes or misdemeanors\u201d lodged by the House.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nBut he added in an interview with CNBC: \u201cHow long you\u2019re on it, is a whole different matter,\u201d possibly referring to the right of any senator to move to dismiss the charges, thus short-circuiting a full-blown Senate trial and a vote on convicting Trump - if the motion were to be approved.\n\nRepublicans who control the Senate have shown little appetite for ousting Trump.", "description": "The Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives was set on Wednesday to step up its impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump over his dealings with Ukraine, as the White House declared it would not cooperate with the probe.", "authors": ["Richard Cowan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438701106&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF98074", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
