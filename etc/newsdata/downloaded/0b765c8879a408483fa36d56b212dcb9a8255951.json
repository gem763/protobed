The scheme MUD has come up with is to essentially hire your jeans, long term. You pay for them in monthly instalments making them more affordable too, wear them for a year and then you can trade them in for a new pair, or just keep them. Your used jeans are then recycled to make more jeans, keeping the materials out of landfill.\n\nRiley Studio, riley.studio\n\nUsing only recycled waste materials to make its clothes, Riley Studio steers away from designs for each season and instead focuses on wardrobe staples that are also gender neutral. The brand doesn\u2019t use new fibres, and instead it uses biodegradable fabrics and ones that are also infinitely recyclable, as well as fibres made from plastic water bottles that would otherwise be disposed of. It also uses organic cotton which uses less water, too.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
