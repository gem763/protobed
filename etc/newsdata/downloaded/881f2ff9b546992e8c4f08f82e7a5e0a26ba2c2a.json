His father came out in support of Extinction Rebellion, his partner is a vocal advocate for urgent action on the ecological and climate emergency.\n\nExtinction Rebellion (activists pictured above at Smithfield Market today) have claimed that Boris Johnson comes from a family on environmentalists\n\nThe Prime Minister (pictured above) hit out at the activists and called them 'crusties however the group said it made them smile\n\nThe group highlighted Stanley Johnson's alliance with them and also mentioned the work Carrie Symonds had previously done. Stanley Johnson is pictured left on October 1 wearing an Extinction Rebellion badge and Miss Symonds is pictured right at a march to stop whaling back in January\n\nThe group have taken over the capital today and some were seen on the Mall holding a long sign this afternoon\n\n'They are part of the growing movement of everyday people who are deeply worried about our safety in the face of Ecological and Climate Emergency.'\n\nCarrie Symonds worked as a senior advisor at Oceana, a group which helps protect the world's oceans. She had also previously led communications for the Conservative Party, in which she was said to have promoted policies on the environment and animal welfare.\n\nThis is while Stanley Johnson said just last month that he planned to work with the group and that he had been 'very impressed' by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nHe has been an environmental campaigner for years and had previously worked for the Pollution Division of the EU.\n\nAround 321 protesters have been arrested by officers after they closed bridges and major roads on the first day of a fortnight of action in London yesterday.\n\nThis week Downing Street said protesters who 'significantly disrupt the lives of others' should feel the 'full force of the law'. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'It is essential that people can continue to go about their business. The right to peaceful protest does not extend to unlawful activity.\n\nEnvironmentalist group 'Extinction Rebellion' continues to stage protests in second day occupying central locations including Trafalgar Square, Victoria Street, Parliament Street in London\n\nExtinction Rebellion posted this graphic online before the protests began, showing where their intended targets would be\n\nExtinction Rebellion climate change protesters wake up in their tents on Whitehall in London this morning\n\nActivists protest oppostite the Hoses of Parliament during the second day of climate change demonstrations by the Extinction Rebellion group\n\nExtinction Rebellion protesters spotted ordering at McDonald's and drinking from disposable Pret A Manger coffee cups Extinction Rebellion protesters were spotted ordering food at a McDonald's restaurant in Westminster today as the protests continued. TalkRADIO presenter Julia Hartley-Brewer tweeted a photograph of the scene, saying: 'Spotted in Westminster: Extinction Rebellion protesters queuing for lunch at... McDonalds. You. Couldn't. Make. This. Stuff. Up. If. You. Tried.' Extinction Rebellion protesters were spotted ordering food at a McDonald's restaurant in Westminster today today The protesters in the tweet, which received more than 3,500 likes, were mocked online - with one Twitter user saying: 'Priceless. Mummy didn't have any mung beans in to make Jocasta and Tarquin their packed lunch.' Another said: 'We must stop capitalism and cease all modern farming and industry practices! Right after I get my mass produced McNuggets...' Other demonstrators were seen gathering outside a Pret A Manger on Great Peter Street in Westminster, with some spotted drinking from disposable coffee cups.\n\n'The Government expects police to take a firm stance against protesters who significantly disrupt the lives of others and to use the full force of the law.'\n\nThe group, however, have said that Mr Johnson has been in part right about them in how they have been 'uncooperative'.\n\n'He did get one thing right. We are uncooperative. The mums, doctors, lawyers, builders and crusties that make up Extinction Rebellion will continue to rebel and make great sacrifices until his Government takes action on our three demands.\n\n'On day two of Rebellion, we are blockading Government Departments because existing policies won't avert the danger we face.'\n\nToday Extinction Rebellion activist Glenn Drake, 65, from Lowestoft in Suffolk, brandished a sign which read 'Boris, sort climate change first, (then) prorogue Brexit', at Trafalgar Square on the second day of the two-week long international protests.\n\nMr Drake is a Brexiteer, but said politicians should be prioritising tackling climate change before securing a deal with the EU.\n\nHe said: 'I voted for Brexit, mainly because I don't want to be part of a federal Europe.\n\n'But because of the urgency of climate change, we need to put aside Brexit.\n\n'No-one can agree on it, the country is 50/50 split, so let's put that aside and let's concentrate on the main issue, and that's climate change.'\n\nActivists in Trafalgar Square this week included celebrities such as model Daisy Lowe, comedian Ruby Wax and actors Juliet Stevenson and Mark Rylance.\n\nBut residents, commuters, hospital patients and paramedics reacted with fury at the protests, which brought the capital to a standstill for the second time this year.\n\nDemonstrators set up roadblocks on Westminster and Lambeth Bridges, Victoria Street, Whitehall, Horse Guards Road and The Mall. Scotland Yard vowed to take a tougher line after being accused of surrendering the streets to them for more than a week during demonstrations in April.\n\nThis graphic from Google Maps shows the disruption caused to key traffic routes in Westminster by the protesters today\n\nProtesters were today camped outside parliament and tents could be seen lining the streets. Litter looked to be absent after the group were previously criticised for leaving a mess during summer protests\n\nBanners which read 'our future is going up in smoke' were held today along with another which said 'power in truth'\n\nHoards of protesters were seen sat on the green across from parliament as many people struggled to navigate the city due to disruption\n\nDespite much of the protests being peaceful police were pictured carrying people away from the demonstrations today\n\nPassionate vegan, 33, who walked out of the Big Brother house gets involved in vegan protest at Smithfield A passionate vegan who wants the lifestyle to become mainstream walked out of the Big Brother house last year was today involved in a protest at Smithfield Market. Kay Lovelle, 33, left the Channel 5 programme last October after repeatedly clashing with fellow housemates. She later admitted deciding to walk in the dead of night to avoid having to face the public. Speaking to Sky News at Smithfield Market today, Lovell, who is protesting with Animal Rebellion, said: 'We're here to demand a complete system change, so to actually transition into a plant based food system. Kay Lovelle, 33, spoke to Sky News today while she takes part in the Animal Rebellion protest at Smithfield Market this afternoon 'As we now know, animal agriculture accounts for a huge, huge amount. And it causes really devastating impact on the environment, causing the whole climate catastrophe. It's more than all of transport put together. 'We can no longer deny the impact our diet has on our planet. We cannot escape this climate catastrophe if we don't transition into a plant based food system. We are here to show our version of the future. 'So we're actually opening up a massive fruit and veg market. We've got a lot of incredible vegan meats and cheeses and plant-based vendors here. We're not here to take anyone's jobs, we're not here to do anything like that. This is really very peaceful, non-violent.' Kay Lovelle, 33, left the Channel 5 reality show Big Brother last October after repeatedly clashing with fellow housemates Lovelle, an actress who has had roles in the likes of The Bill, Judge John Deed and Inspector Lewis, was born in Georgia and lived in Russia before moving to London as a child. Speaking in the diary room before her exit from Big Brother last year, she said: 'I just really feel that I'm going to be eaten alive. I don't want to put myself through that because I will just be running for the fire exits. I just feel so trapped.'\n\nSome London activists glued themselves to scaffolding, and one parked a hearse in Trafalgar Square and locked himself to the steering wheel.\n\nThey also shut down Smithfield meat market in east London. Mark Rylance gave a speech in which he revealed that his decision to resign from the Royal Shakespeare Company over its sponsorship contract with BP was inspired by teenage activist Greta Thunberg. Addressing a crowd off The Mall, he said: 'The collapse of society is certain.'\n\nActress Juliet Stevenson said: 'All over the world, millions and millions of people's lives are already feeling the impact and livelihoods are being destroyed.' The protesters staged a wedding, did yoga and set up camps with tents during the demonstration to curb global warming.\n\nThey also played cricket outside the Supreme Court, while 'lady vicars' occupying the south side of Lambeth Bridge sang hymns.\n\nExtinction Rebellion claims the protests could be five times bigger than those in April, which brought major disruption to London and saw more than 1,100 arrests.\n\nIt cost Scotland Yard \u00a316million to police the earlier demonstrations \u2013 enough to pay the salaries of 600 bobbies.\n\nThe protest is part of an 'international rebellion' taking place in cities including Berlin, Madrid, Amsterdam and New York.\n\nIn response to claims the police have been outnumbered by protesters, a spokesman for the Met said: 'The Met has taken a robust stance in policing this protest with over 270 arrests made so far and the seizure of equipment that prevents sustained and unlawful protest and will continue to arrest.\n\n'We have a proportionate policing plan in place and relevant resources to deal with any incidents that may arise, however, whilst we have a significant number of officers policing the protests, we also have to ensure that enough officers remain on their boroughs to continue to carry out day-to-day policing and protect the wider community.'\n\nMinisters are understood to be looking at whether protesters who damage parts of London can be held financially responsible. In an Extinction Rebellion stunt last week, fake blood was sprayed over the Treasury \u2013 although much of it ended up going back over the demonstrators themselves.\n\nOne government source suggested a mechanism could be bringing a civil action to hurt demonstrators 'in their wallets'. 'There is discussion about whether we can ensure they are bearing the cost,' the source said. 'Democratic protests is one thing, but you cannot wreck listed buildings.'\n\nHowever, actress Juliet Stevenson called the protests 'wonderful', adding: 'We can't any longer allow governments to do this so we have to make it clear that there is no more time.\n\n'There's a long tradition in this country of people saying governments are not acting, we have to make them realise how urgent this is.'\n\nActivists say the protests could be five times bigger than those in April, which saw more than 1,100 arrests. They are part of an 'international rebellion', with action also taking place in Berlin, Madrid, Amsterdam and New York.\n\nPolice had arrested 148 protesters by 3pm today as key traffic routes through Westminster faced major congestion today with buses diverted and the demonstrations expected to escalate over the next fortnight.\n\nProtestors were seen today wearing high visibility jackets as they took to the streets they were also wearing hard hats and red noses\n\nParliament Square was empty of traffic except for police vans and bicycles as helicopters circled overhead, while on Lambeth Bridge protesters started to build a house before climbing on top when police tried to dismantle it.\n\nThe demonstrators, who are also planning processions, marches and a sit-in at City Airport, claim they are ready to face arrest, go to jail and go on hunger strike as they urge politicians to outline plans to tackle climate change.\n\nEight people were arrested on Saturday - seven on suspicion of conspiracy to cause public nuisance, and the eighth on suspicion of obstructing police. All those arrested on Saturday have been released under investigation.\n\nAnd on Sunday one woman and two men were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to cause public nuisance. The woman has been released under investigation, the men remain in custody, the police said.\n\nScotland Yard also commented: 'On Sunday, October 6 one female and two males were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to cause public nuisance. The female has been released under investigation, the males remain in custody.\n\n'On Saturday, October 5 eight arrests were made. Seven arrests were on suspicion of conspiracy to cause public nuisance, while the eighth was made on suspicion of obstructing police. All those arrested on Saturday have been released under investigation.'\n\nSecret plans seen by the Daily Mail have revealed tactics by XR to frustrate the police, cause 'economic disruption' and 'take over' government departments.\n\nThe group has warned its peaceful protest blockading Westminster would be five times bigger than those seen earlier this year \u2013 and could disrupt the Queen's Speech. The protesters will issue an alternative 'People's Speech' \u2013 which will be 'based on the demands of the rebels on the streets'.\n\n'We might be called terrorists. We might cause people to go hungry. Parents will be late picking up their kids. We'll cause people to struggle to pay rent.\n\n'We'll cause people working on wonderful, progressive, healing art projects to have their cause set back and their art seen by no one. At the same time we need to hold the awareness that these things are occurring within an insane and suicidal system.'\n\nIt comes after the activists were able to spray nearly 400 gallons of organic water containing beetroot on the Treasury and themselves last week before at least 30 officers and 12 police vehicles arrived on the scene.\n\nFootage of the spray painting suggested there were no police on the scene when the incident began. A large cordon was later put place around the fire engine, which was bought on eBay for around \u00a32,000 by activists.\n\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps warned the disruption was 'unlikely to win over hearts and minds and will do damage to the economy and people's livelihoods'. He added: 'I am concerned that it will potentially turn people against an important cause.'\n\nExtinction Rebellion plans to hand out 'bust cards' informing protesters of their legal rights. It says that small-scale deployments are harder for police to 'kettle' \u2013 or contain.\n\nIt also advises a tactic of 50 people walking backwards and forwards across a crossing continuously for seven minutes to create 'cascading congestion', adding: 'This is totally legal.'\n\nProtests in April saw about 5,000 activists take part \u2013 with actress Emma Thompson making a speech on top of a pink sailing boat at Oxford Circus.\n\nThis time Extinction Rebellion says it will muster 20,000 to 30,000 protesters. Activists drove tractors painted pink towards London yesterday. One Twitter user remarked: 'Is it running on diesel, or a prayer?'\n\nCelebrities also backed the protest. Oscar-winning actress Olivia Colman and TV hosts Stephen Fry and Alan Carr donned the group's 'X' badges at the Royal Albert Hall on Thursday night, joined by comedian Asim Chaudry and US actress Crystal Clarke.\n\nSpice Girl Mel B said: 'I'm giving all my support to these brave activists to make a better world for us all.' Model Daisy Lowe offered her support, saying: 'It's time for change. It's time for rebellion and I love being able to be part of it.'\n\nMiss Colman and Chaudry have both appeared in British Airways in-flight safety films. London City Airport, from which BA operates, is a target.\n\nExtinction Rebellion spokesman Joel Scott-Halkes said: 'We're going to blockade and shut down every single road going into the central area of Westminster around the government.'\n\nOn Saturday, Met Police used a battering ram to raid a warehouse in Kennington, South London. Seven women and three men were arrested.\n\nTransport officials warned commuters to the capital to leave plenty of time for travel and check for disruption.", "description": "Extinction Rebellion have been protesting across London and today claimed that even Prime Minister Boris Johnson's father Stanley supports their cause.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/12/19439136-0-image-a-22_1570532827570.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
