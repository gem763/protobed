The shares were in free fall on Tuesday, losing more than a third of their value in one day, and by the end of the week were at 192.7p.\n\nCompare that with their peak of 4000p in March 2018 and the 2000p at which they were sold to investors in the 2016 stock market float and it demonstrates that it is not a journey for the faint-hearted.\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at stock broker AJ Bell, says shareholders thinking about what to do next will be governed by two schools of thoughts.\n\nMetro Bank shares were in free fall on Tuesday, losing more than a third of their value in one day, and by the end of the week were at 192.7p\n\n'One is,' he says, 'never catch a falling knife; and the other is, you're only going to make money by making the hardest decisions.'\n\nThe shares have now lost 90 per cent of their value this year.\n\nThe big jolt down was sparked by the announcement in January about serious accounting errors, and then given a fresh impetus by Monday's shock decision to pull a bond issue because of insufficient demand, despite a very attractive 7.5 per cent interest rate.\n\nLingering anxiety about regulatory issues \u2013 the accounting matter is being investigated \u2013 contributed to the nervousness.\n\nAt these prices, Metro's stock market value has crumbled to below \u00a3400million. That's for a bank which says its assets are valued at \u00a31.8billion.\n\nThe discrepancy helps explain why there are suggestions Metro (founded by dog-loving American Vernon Hill, pictured) could be taken over, although Mould cautions that holding a share in the hope of a bid requires enormous patience.\n\nDismal: Metro's stock market value has crumbled to below \u00a3400million\n\nBids often don't materialise and come at a lower price than the market hopes (think insurer Royal and Sun Alliance, he says, touted as a target for two decades).\n\nSo what about shares in other challenger banks? The reality is that for investors seeking out exposure to rivals to the big four \u2013 Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 there are fewer options than there used to be.\n\nA number of the best known names have been bought in the last few years. TSB \u2013 spun out of Lloyds \u2013 was taken over by Spain's Sabadell in 2015.\n\nShawbrook has been sold back to the investors that first floated it, BC Partners and Pollen Street Capital.\n\nAldermore, which floated in 2015, was sold to South Africa's largest bank First Rand in 2017 for 313p a share, which compares with its listing price of 192p.\n\nAnd some of the high-profile new entrants which are popular with their customers \u2013 the likes of Monzo and Starling Bank \u2013 are not listed on the stock market (at least, not yet).\n\nThat leaves buy-to-let lender One Savings (whose roots lie in the Kent Reliance building society) which is in the process of taking over buy-to-let rival Charter Court, Secure Trust, Paragon and CYBG, the owner of Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks, which has bought Virgin Money.\n\nCrucially, not all are 'banks' in the traditional sense of running current accounts and granting loans, with different business models and different exposures.\n\nRichard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, points that they also differ from the big incumbent players.\n\n'Challenger banks don't have things like legacy regulatory issues \u2013 most notably payment protection insurance,' he says.\n\nNeither do they have creaky IT systems nor vast and expensive branch networks, Hunter adds.\n\nIt means they also have different things to offer: Mould says Secure Trust has the highest yield while Paragon has a lean cost base and One Savings looks cheap when its stock market value is compared with the value of its assets.\n\nThe one thing they do have in common, says Helal Miah at the Share Centre, is their exposure to the UK economy, which is facing uncertainty over Brexit.\n\nThis 'difficult' environment is one of the reasons the broker is not that keen on the challenger bank sector.\n\nEven the mainstream banks are not at the top of its list \u2013 although HSBC, with its exposure outside the UK, is one that Miah highlights.\n\nBut HSBC also has exposure to Hong Kong where government protests have dominated the news coverage of late.\n\nAnd all of the banks are grappling with low interest rates. This affects their net interest margin \u2013 essentially the profit they make on the difference between what they pay savers and the rate they are able to sell loans.\n\n'Unfortunately for the time being in the UK, it's does not look like [net interest margin], is going to be going up,' says Miah.\n\nThat matters, says Mould, as 'that's the bread and butter, that's what banks do'.", "description": "What a week it's been for Metro Bank investors.
