For some it\u2019s about financial security. \u201cWhat if there was something else you needed to do with your time but you couldn\u2019t not go to work? \u2014 money buys you the freedom to make that choice for yourself,\u201d she says.\n\nSee: Why does the early-retirement movement have so many haters?\n\nMarketWatch Bianca, a Denver-based flight attendant, is financially independent, but she\u2019s not yet ready to quit working.\n\nHer journey to financial independence may have been fast, but it wasn\u2019t exactly easy. Over many years, Bianca went from earning $14 an hour to $60 an hour, and she believes in delayed gratification \u2014 that is, making sacrifices now to enjoy the benefits later. She has also encountered her share of losses. She bought her home when she was 24 years old and spent much of her younger years investing in real estate, but she lost three properties in short sales in two years after the housing crisis of 2008.\n\n\u201cI needed a new plan,\u201d she said.\n\nEnter FIRE.\n\nFIRE is usually associated with leaving the workforce in your 40s, or maybe even 30s or late 20s. But it doesn\u2019t have to be, she said. The job or schedule may change, but the beauty of financial independence is that the people on this journey get to choose how they approach it, or when. \u201cI think \u2018retire early\u2019 is a misnomer,\u201d Bianca said. \u201cI don\u2019t know many people doing nothing. They do side work or a passion project.\u201d\n\nRead: Forget retirement \u2014 focus on financial independence\n\nThere are a couple of reasons Bianca isn\u2019t quitting her job, even though financially she would be OK doing so. The first: She wants to earn her flight benefits, where she can jump on a flight for free after she retires, but that would require the attendant\u2019s age and years of service to equal 65. In 2022, she\u2019ll reach that goal: she will be 44 and have accrued 21 years of service. She also appreciates her low-cost health care plan through her employer, which she won\u2019t have once she retires.\n\nThe second: She doesn\u2019t know exactly what she will do when she retires.\n\nThe flight attendant is currently grappling with what she\u2019ll feel when she\u2019s not getting a steady paycheck. \u201cIt\u2019s a weird mental shift,\u201d she said about entering the retirement part of FIRE. \u201cWe have a high savings rate and side hustles, and once it\u2019s all done your mind doesn\u2019t stop thinking about the accumulating, so it\u2019s hard to start drawing down.\u201d\n\nBianca, who also blogs at Miss Mazuma, has a few tips for people who want to follow the FIRE lifestyle:\n\n\u2022 Track your spending: See where your money goes and how much you\u2019re spending on certain items, services or in various categories like groceries or nights out.\n\n\u2022 Save, but don\u2019t scrimp: \u201cDon\u2019t tighten down so much that you lose the joys in your life,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t say no to things you want to do because it gets you out of work a few days sooner 10 years from now.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t expect to maintain your budget for the rest of your life: Account for some flexibility when you\u2019re figuring out how much to save, and expect you\u2019ll spend more than the budget you allot yourself in retirement. \u201cDon\u2019t make it where you take all the pleasures out of your life,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso see: These people left their jobs behind to retire early \u2014 then life got in the way. Here\u2019s how they coped with FIRE plans gone wrong\n\nAnd although she doesn\u2019t know exactly what she\u2019ll do when she gets to retirement, Bianca has a few ideas for what may occupy some of her newfound freedom in 2022. She knows she\u2019d like to volunteer, specifically with animal-related causes, and she\u2019d like to do more farming and gardening. Her first task, however, will be to decompress and create a stable routine, something that\u2019s difficult for most flight attendants, who are traveling across the country for a few days at a time, and then off for a few days.\n\n\u201cFinancial independence to me is having control over your time, it\u2019s not based on money,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to exchange my time for money, so I can do the things I want to do in life.\u201d", "description": "She hit her \u2018FIRE number,\u2019 saving 25 times her cost of living", "authors": ["Alessandra Malito"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HM565_bianca_MG_20190701152300.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-10"}
