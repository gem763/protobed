As long as they\u2019re left the protesters\u2019 demands unaddressed, the storm won\u2019t pass.\"\n\nSince early June, Hong Kong has been engulfed in anti-government protests triggered by an extradition bill that would have allowed accused individuals to be sent to mainland China for trial.\n\nFollowing Lam\u2019s speech, Secretary for Security John Lee is scheduled to formally withdraw the legislation later in the afternoon.\n\nEven though the withdrawal was announced in early September, it came too late for many protesters and has failed to ease the tension in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory, which is enduring its worst political tumult in more than a half-century.\n\nFive demands\n\nPublic anger has been fuelled by the government's refusal to address protesters' five demands.\n\nAs well as the extradition bill's withdrawal, the protesters are calling for an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality in suppressing the protests, an amnesty for all those charged with offences resulting from their participation in the protests, and a retraction of police claims that protesters are guilty of rioting.\n\nA ban on face coverings, which protect protesters from tear gas but also make them difficult to identify, was introduced with colonial-era emergency powers, bypassing LegCo, and has only sent more demonstrators onto the streets.\n\nSecurity was extremely tight around the legislature on Wednesday after hundreds of protesters stormed the building in early July and vandalised the main conference chamber. The damage cut short the last session by three weeks and forced the new session to be delayed by a week.\n\nIn recent weeks, infuriated by what they see as abuse of power by the police, some protesters have called for the force to be disbanded.\n\nSo far, police have arrested close to 2,500 people and charged nearly 500 in four months of protests. About 750 are under the age of 18.\n\nProtesters have continued to march - masked - in defiance over emergency laws banning face coverings. [Tyrone Siu/Reuters]\n\n'Fundamentally unjust'\n\nA former British colony, Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997 under a \"one country, two systems\" framework, which guarantees Hong Kong people rights and freedoms largely absent in mainland China.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Lam will tackle \u201cthe elephant in the room\u201d by offering further compromises to address protesters\u2019 demands in an attempt to put to rest the political storm.\n\nThe relief measures she is expected to propose won\u2019t benefit most of the students, who continue to be the driving force of the protest movement.\n\n\u201cIn survey after survey we\u2019ve found that their motivation to protest lies not in the lack of affordable housing or job prospect, but in their sense of injustice,\u201d the Education University of Hong Kong's Chiu told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"They see our society as fundamentally unjust.\"", "description": "Chief executive expected to unveil poverty-reduction moves, including cash handouts, but protesters unlikely to budge.", "authors": ["Violet Law"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/16/9442a6574c4b486cad9c65b509c7fe03_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
