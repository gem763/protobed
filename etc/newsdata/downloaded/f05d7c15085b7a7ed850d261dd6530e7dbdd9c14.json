The frequent absences of Jared Kushner, the Republican president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, and presidential daughter Ivanka Trump during moments of consequence have long been a running joke among their detractors. Their detours included a trip to Florida during the partial government shutdown.\n\nPlenty of others have jumped town during tense moments.\n\nAs Trump struggled with mounting Republican defections over his decision to declare a national emergency to pay for the stalled border wall, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney wasn\u2019t at the Capitol cajoling his former colleagues or in the West Wing making calls. Instead, he was in Las Vegas for an annual friends and family getaway\u2026\n\nThe White House did not respond to questions about the tactic Wednesday. But even when they\u2019re in Washington, many of the White House\u2019s most visible officials have been staying out of public view, letting the president\u2019s indignant Twitter feed and his frequent commentary drive the public conversation.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nbcnews.Com Politics White-House"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
