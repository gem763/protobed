Plant grass and give it two months, go back, see where people tramped the grass down - called desire lines - and off you go, build your path there. Can we get better? Sure, of course. But let's tread carefully about what kinds of tech we use.\"\n\nThe panel - set up last year by Waterfront Toronto, the public body overseeing the Quayside project - also questioned:\n\nSidewalk Labs's link to parent company Alphabet, with its \"significant economic and political power\"\n\nthe data-driven business model of many of its \"corporate siblings\"\n\nthe lobbying efforts it had made around its plans for Quayside\n\nIn response, Sidewalk Labs said: \"Most of the feedback we see in this interim report has been conveyed to us throughout our engagement with the digital strategy advisory panel over the last few months.\n\n\"It is one of the reasons why we are producing the Digital Innovation Appendix which will include a comprehensive list of technology that would be deployed in Quayside, how we would support Toronto's technology ecosystem, and our research work on data governance.\"\n\nNext month, city officials must decide whether to approve or reject the proposals put forward by Sidewalk Labs.", "description": "A panel of experts criticises Google's ambitious plans for a smart city in Toronto.", "authors": ["Jane Wakefield", "Technology Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/724F/production/_107536292_keatingchannel_sidewalklabs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
