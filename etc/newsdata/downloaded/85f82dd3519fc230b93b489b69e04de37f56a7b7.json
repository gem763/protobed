Come on, it\u2019s far too predictable and obvious. He might believe Cain is his dad but he won\u2019t be. Faith is his mum, that\u2019s why she looked so horrified in the caravan, she found something.\"\n\nAnother agreed: \"BUT is Nate Cains son or does he just think he is? This could all be back to front.....\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nA third added: \"I think Nate believes he\u2019s Cain\u2019s son but he might actually be Faith\u2019s. Her face at the end pretty much revealed something much darker.\"\n\nSo could Faith know more than she's let on about Nathaniel, or could she be his mum?\n\nViewers will have to stay tuned ahead of explosive scenes on the lake between Nate, Cain and Moira as the truth is revealed.\n\nEmmerdale airs weeknights at 7pm on ITV, with an extra episode at 8pm on Thursdays.", "description": "Emmerdale viewers think Nate Robinson's claims he's the son of Cain Dingle could be about to take a major turn", "authors": ["Charlotte Tutton", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20542918.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_EHP_CHP_091019emmerdale_5633JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
