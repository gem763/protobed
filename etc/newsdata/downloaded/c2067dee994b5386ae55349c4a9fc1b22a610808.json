GM leads all companies in automobiles produced in Mexico at just over 833,000 last year, according to LMC and the Center for Automotive Research, a think-tank based in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Of GM vehicles sold in the U.S., 22% are produced in Mexico.\n\nThe strike by 49,000 workers, now in its 23rd day, began Sept. 16, and immediately shut down all of GM\u2019s U.S. factories. Later two factories in Canada and Mexico were forced to close due to a lack of parts.\n\nThe strike has cost the company production of 165,000 cars and trucks and has passed the point where the GM can make up lost volume, according to auto industry analysts.\n\nThat means losses are starting to mount for the company even though its dealers have enough inventory to get by for several more weeks.\n\nTalks also were hung up on hourly wage increases versus lump-sum payments favored by the company, according to a person briefed on the talks. They\u2019re also haggling over pensions, faster wage increases for workers hired after 2007, and guarantees of new products for U.S. factories, said the person, who didn\u2019t want to be identified because the talks are confidential.\n\nFifteen of GM\u2019s 18 North American assembly plants have been shut down by the strike, including everything in the U.S. and one plant each in Mexico and Canada, according to Bill Rinna, director of Americas Vehicle Forecasts for the LMC Automotive consulting firm.\n\n\u201cOnce the strike ends, it may still take up to a week to get the parts pipeline going again. So we are likely looking at a loss of well over 200,000 vehicles,\u201d Rinna wrote in a note distributed Tuesday.\n\nMuch of that production can\u2019t be made up, especially at factories that make popular pickup trucks and large SUVs that already were on three shifts per day before the strike, said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of the Center for Automotive Research, an industry think tank.\n\nThe strike has cost GM about $1.6 billion according to numbers from JP Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman, who estimates that GM is losing $82 million per day.\n\nStrikers, meanwhile, are in their fourth week without earning a full paycheck from GM of around $1,200 per week before deductions. Instead they have to live on $250 per week in union strike pay.\n\nThe Anderson Economic Group, a consulting firm in East Lansing, Michigan, estimated that 75,000 workers for auto parts supply companies have either been laid off or had their wages reduced because GM factories no longer need the parts. The firm predicts that the impact will expand each day that GM\u2019s factories are silent.\n\nThe strike also has delayed production of the new mid-engine Chevrolet Corvette sports car, which was supposed to start in December, Rinna wrote. GM\u2019s Corvette plant in Bowling Green, Kentucky, had about 1,000 of the current-generation Corvettes left to build before the strike. Then the plant was to switch its equipment over to build the new version. Now, Rinna wrote, GM will either have to delay the new car\u2019s launch or retool the plant faster.\n\n\u201cEither option could cost GM dearly,\u201d he wrote.", "description": "Talks between General Motors and the United Auto Workers union hit a snag Tuesday over what the union says is a lack of commitment by GM to build new...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS532_gmstri_ZG_20191002191654.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
