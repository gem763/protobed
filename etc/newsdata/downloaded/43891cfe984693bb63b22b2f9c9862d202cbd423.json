I am pleading guilty, I can't really afford to keep coming to court.'\n\nSwampy, now 42, lives in the picturesque Welsh village of Talley in Carmarthenshire, known for its community of environmentalists who live in teepees.\n\nHe was one of 10 Extinction Rebellion protestors who blocked three entrances to the oil refinery last month.\n\nThe 42-year-old represented himself in court and was ordered to pay \u00a385 in court costs and a \u00a332 surcharge.\n\nHooper found fame with the nickname Swampy in 1996 after becoming the face of the Newbury bypass protests by living in tunnels under the roadworks.\n\nHe and others also climbed trees due to be felled for the construction of the new road.\n\nHooper, known as 'Swampy', rose to fame in the 1990s when he protested against the Newbury bypass. He is pictured in one of his tunnels in 1997\n\nAfter getting involved in a similar protest against the extension of the A30 in Devon he appeared on the BBC's Have I Got News For You.\n\nHe was reported to have been involved in the 2007 climate change protests at London Heathrow Airport but has kept a relatively low profile ever since.\n\nAs of 2013 he was still registered as living in the New Age commune in Wales with his family.\n\nExtinction Rebellion protests are going on in towns and cities around the world this week.\n\nSo far 319 activists have been arrested for various offences in London, according to the Metropolitan Police.", "description": "Daniel Hooper, who found fame after his Vietcong-style tunneling protests against new roads in the 1990s,\u00a0handcuffed himself to a concrete block at the entrance to the Valero plant in Pembroke, Wales.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/14/19443224-0-image-a-26_1570539818143.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
