'But I\u2019m thrilled that I don\u2019t have to.'\n\nDailyMail.com does not typically identify victims of sexual abuse, but Richards has gone public with her allegations after becoming the first of the five women to sue Cano in June 2017.\n\nIn an interview with WLKY, Richards, previously known only as 'Jane Doe 1,' said it was a 'huge relief' for her knowing that Cano was off the streets.\n\nOne of Cano's victims, Heather Richards (pictured), said she was relieved that the ex-cop was off the streets\n\nProsecutor Kristi Gray said while some of the victims were hoping for a lengthier prison term for Cano, none of them wanted to go through a criminal trial.\n\nAttorney Shannon Fauver, who represents the victims in their civil lawsuits against Cano and the Louisville Metro Police, said her clients felt somewhat vindicated when the former cop was forced to say 'guilty' in response to each criminal count in court.\n\nCano also pleaded guilty on Monday to possessing child pornography stemming from sexually explicit material depicting a minor that was discovered during the initial sexual misconduct probe, reported Louisville Courier-Journal.\n\nAs part of the plea agreement, Cano will have to register as a sex offender and will be required to complete a sex offender program in prison in order to become eligible for parole.\n\nOne of the five civil suits was dropped after the plaintiff opted not to pursue it, but the other four are still winding their way through the court system.\n\nFauver said she is hopeful that Monday's plea deal will pave the way toward a settlement that would spare her clients having to testify in civil court.", "description": "Pablo Cano, 38, a former officer with the Louisville Metro Police, has pleaded guilty to five counts of misdemeanor sexual misconduct and one count of possession of child pornography.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Snejana Farberov For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/15/19447152-0-image-a-33_1570546540415.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
