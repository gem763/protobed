(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nAfter clothing company Bstroy made sweatshirts displaying the names of schools targeted by mass shooters, it was shunned on social media. The designer now says the shirts are a commentary on gun violence.\n\nA few days ago, Bstroy, which describes itself as a \u201cneo-native menswear design house,\u201d shared images on Instagram of male models showing off the Samsara collection, reportedly in New York City. The sweatshirts were riddled with faux bullet holes and read, \u201cColumbine,\u201d \u201cSandy Hook,\u201d and \u201cStoneman Douglas,\u201d representing three schools affected by gun violence over the years.\n\nA mass shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, claimed the lives of 13 people in 1999; one at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., resulted in 27 deaths; and in 2018, a gunman at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., killed 17 people.\n\nThis week, Bstroy designers Duey Catorze and Brick Owens posted images from the fashion show to Instagram, where their artistic vision was lost.\n\n\u201cMy dead classmates dying should not be a f*cking fashion statement,\u201d commented one person. Another wrote, \u201cYou thought this was controversial and thought provoking didn\u2019t you.\u201d\n\nOne person wrote: \u201cAs a victim of Columbine, I am appalled. This is disgusting. You can draw awareness another way but don't you dare make money off of our tragedy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWtf is wrong with you,\u201d wrote another. \u201cCant support u after this,\u201d commented yet another.\n\nBut one follower wrote, \u201cJust so y\u2019all know this is to draw awareness to the gun problem not make fun of.\u201d\n\nFred Guttenberg, whose 14-year-old daughter Jaime died in the Parkland, Fla., tragedy, tweeted, \u201cUnder what scenario could somebody think this was a good idea? This has me so upset. If any of my followers [know] anybody involved with this clothing line, please ask them to stop it immediately.\u201d\n\nUnder what scenario could somebody think this was a good idea?

Like the irony of dying violently in a place you consider to be a safe, controlled environment, like school. We are reminded all the time of life's fragility, shortness, and unpredictability yet we are also reminded of its infinite potential. It is this push and pull that creates the circular motion that is the cycle of life. Nirvana is the goal we hope to reach through meditation and healthy practices that counter our destructive baits. Samsara is the cycle we must transcend to reach Nirvana.\"\n\nCo-founder Catorze tells Yahoo Lifestyle in a statement, \u201cWe wanted to make reference to the victims with reverence. And tell a story that depicts them as heroes.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe statement read, \u201c....We wanted to make a comment on gun violence and the type of gun violence that needs preventative attention and what its origins are, while also empowering the survivors of tragedy through storytelling in the clothes...\u201d\n\nPointing to a \u201cmob mentality\u201d in the public\u2019s response, the statement says, \u201cBut something interesting happens when making a statement so loud about something so obviously sensitive. People get the opportunity to form their opinions before they get all the information and here we see the internal desire of society rear its head. People seem to want to release hateful energy as a default. Rather than waiting to hear an explanation or assuming [there] is a good one, the mainstream consumer bids to \u2018cancel\u2019 so and so. Mob mentality.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hoodies as a device had this function as well,\u201d the response continued. \u201cWe get to see ourselves as we are when we are critiques and analyze why we assume in the direction we do. Also built into the device is the fact that our image as young black males has not been traditionally awarded credit for introducing [avant garde] ideas so many people have assumed our message to be lazy just because of what they\u2019ve been taught about black men. These hoodies were made with all of these intentions in mind. To explore all of these societal issues. Not just the surface layer of gun violence in schools but also the different ways that we relate to each other and the dated ideas that still shape the assumptions we make about each other.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe response finished with, \u201cThe hoodies have only been shown not sold and the school shooting hoodies were initially intended to be just for the show and not to sell but that may change now. Art\u2019s job is to wring emotion out. What we do with it after is subjective and on us.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:", "description": "Bstroy's line of sweatshirts printed with the schools affected by gun violence, upset many on social media.", "authors": ["Elise Sol\u00e9"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/CHU1k0SjzJD.3m.LuAQEFA--~B/aD00MDAwO3c9NjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/431ef730-d998-11e9-beff-bcebd44412e3", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
