Here, there and everywhere, he helped pull the strings alongside Jonny Sexton and terrorised the Scottish defence with his pinpoint precise box kicks. The zip in his passing was back, too.\n\nManu Tuilagi (England)\n\nIf it was unclear just how important Manu Tuilagi is to England\u2019s World Cup assault, then Sunday\u2019s double-try salvo made it crystal clear. The centre, so often lauded as unplayable when he is at his very best, proved to be England\u2019s game-changer against Tonga. \u201cHe\u2019s is showing everyone what a great player he truly is,\u201d said Maro Itoje after England\u2019s win Sapporo. You suspect there\u2019s more to come.\n\nJosh Adams (Wales)\n\nA real menace against Georgia, the wing\u2019s quick feet and penetrative running proved too hot to handle in Toyota. Two clean breaks in the opening 15 minutes highlighted Adams\u2019 intent before he eventually got over the white line following a sublime, slicing run midway through the first half.\n\nJustin Tipuric (Wales)\n\nStory continues\n\nThe sort of player who has no qualms picking up possession regardless of where he may be on the pitch. Skilful, intelligent and physically imposing, Tipuric proved to be a real asset for the Welsh. His tackling was on point, as was his support play, while he showed his intuition in deceiving the Georgian defence to dot over for his first Test try in 18 months.\n\nJames Ryan (Ireland)\n\nAn industrial, punishing shift from the Leinster lock. He made a total of 14 tackles (0 missed) and 15 carries against the Scottish, and even got his name on the scoreboard with a driven try over the white line after just six minutes of play. Assured in the line-out and technically tight too, one of Ireland\u2019s best players.\n\nJames Ryan celebrates after scoring against Scotland (Getty Images)\n\nMaro Itoje (England)\n\nThe keystone to England\u2019s line-outs, the lock was an absolute force in the air against Tonga. He won five line-outs on England\u2019s ball and secured steals at two Tongan throw-ins. He also chipped in with two further turnovers of his own, and contributed to three more team turnovers that England won. Carried well and got through plenty of defensive work.\n\nDisappointed\n\nSam Johnson (Scotland)\n\nThe 12 struggled to make his mark on the game and was largely anonymous for much of it. Often got his wires crossed with Finn Russell, running dud lines in his fly half\u2019s wake. Was defensively okay but just doesn\u2019t offer enough going forward.\n\nSean Maitland (Scotland)\n\nMuch was expected of the wing but he failed to get a firm footing in the match. Saw a fair bit of the ball but rarely threatened. He simply didn\u2019t have the legs to take it around the Irish defence. A lacklustre display in all. Replaced early in the second half by Darcy Graham.\n\nKyle Sinckler (England)\n\nDiscipline continues to be an issue for the prop, who coughed up too many penalties for his or England\u2019s liking. A solid shift in the front row, and equally effective with the ball in hands, but his lapses in concentration need to be addressed moving forward.\n\nKyle Sinckler in action for England against Tonga (World Rugby via Getty Images)\n\nGrant Gilchrist\n\nA difficult game for the lock, who lacked a meaningful presence at the breakdown and missed a number of important tackles. Found himself flatfooted when Iain Henderson broke for Ireland\u2019s first and slipped off Andrew Conway in the second half. Also dropped the ball late on when Scotland were closing in on the Irish line.
