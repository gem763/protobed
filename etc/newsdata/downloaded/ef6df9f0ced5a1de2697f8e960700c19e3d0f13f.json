Hmmmmm ...", "language": "en", "text": "All right, a third term is an awful idea, with or without impeachment. But politicians should pay a price for frivolity. Oust them on Election Day.\n\nThe ill-considered impeachment efforts against President Donald Trump have seriously interfered with his first term as president. Thus, argues constitutional scholar William Mattox in The Wall Street Journal, if acquitted, Trump should be eligible for a third term, notwithstanding the two-term limit in the 22nd Amendment.\n\nMattox deploys a sports analogy: \u201cIn the National Football League, teams can challenge a call on the field \u2014 but there\u2019s a risk. If instant replay doesn\u2019t merit overturning the call, the challenging team loses one of its three timeouts. That discourages frivolous challenges and keeps the game flowing, while also providing a way to reverse egregious errors.\u201d\n\nHence, a third term for the president: \u201cThat would allow him to make up for the time lost advancing the agenda that voters elected him to enact. It would preserve impeachment for genuine offenses but discourage its use for disputed ones and for mere politics. Absent such an amendment, and in an era when government is divided more often than not, impeachment seems likely to become an increasingly common means of opposition.\u201d\n\nThird terms, no amendment needed?\n\nMattox\u2019s proposal sounds radical, but actually, he\u2019s a piker: He wants to accomplish this shift via a constitutional amendment. How old-fashioned. Doesn\u2019t he know that the Constitution is a living thing, made to grow and change with the times? Over the past century, we have made dramatic changes in the extent of federal power, the redistricting of state legislatures, the constitutionalization of abortion and contraception and gay marriage, and much, much more, all without the tedious necessity of an actual amendment to the Constitution.\n\nPresident Donald Trump boards Air Force One on Aug. 21, 2019.

Simple enough: He didn\u2019t try. And perhaps the Constitution hadn\u2019t lived and breathed quite enough yet, in those primitive days of the 1990s.\n\nHowever, had Clinton done so, he probably could have found some left-leaning legal scholars to argue in his favor. (A few names come to mind right away.) But, of course, if Trump were eligible for a third term in 2024, then I suppose Bill would perforce be as well, setting up \u2014 as Mattox notes \u2014 the possibility of another Trump/Clinton contest in 2024, just with a different Clinton. (Hey, it\u2019s not crazy: Bill Clinton is a bit younger than Trump, and both are younger than Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders).\n\nInto the underground bunker: President Trump is right to keep administration members from secret tribunals\n\nAnd by 2024, when the issue becomes ripe, Trump stands a good chance of having nominated a supermajority of the Supreme Court. As former Justice William Brennan famously said, \u201dFive votes can do anything around here.\u201d\n\nPunish political frivolity at the polls\n\nOK, actually, a third term is an awful idea, with or without impeachment, and my suggestion that we get there without an amendment is even more tongue-in-cheek than Mattox\u2019s suggestion that we get there with one.\n\nSuch a system would encourage all sorts of gaming, beginning with pro-forma impeachments and acquittals to set up a third term and going on from there. And luckily for Trump haters, he has appointed standard originalist justices, not the \u201cliving Constitution\u201d jurists favored by the left. (Something for which, as I\u2019ve suggested before, the left should be grateful.) I doubt there would be a single vote on the court in support of a third term, even if Trump fills seven seats.\n\nEditorial Board: President Trump, your stonewall to impeachment inquiry is cracking\n\nBut Mattox does have a larger point. One reason our politics \u2014 and most especially our congressional politics \u2014 are so frivolous is that there are few consequences for frivolity. There should be a price. I\u2019d support a constitutional amendment to fix that, but there\u2019s zero chance that an amendment to make Congress more accountable would pass Congress these days.\n\nWhat\u2019s left? As a seasoned lobbyist once told me a long time ago, the way you punish a politician is \u201cyou beat 'em.\u201d What little accountability exists for Congress now takes place at the polls. Voters need to make sure it happens.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of \"The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself,\" is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.
