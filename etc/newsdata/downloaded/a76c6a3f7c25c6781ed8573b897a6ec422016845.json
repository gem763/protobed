The CEO of W2 Fuel, a biofuel company, announced that he is closing his plant in Crawfordsville and laying off the fifty employees who work there. The reason he is giving for the closure is that the Renewable Fuel Standard waivers given to more than thirty small refineries by Trump\u2019s EPA this year (85 total since taking office) have reduced demand for ethanol and the market won\u2019t sustain his operations. (Des Moines Register)\n\nAn Iowa biodiesel plant announced Tuesday it\u2019s shutting down as Gov. Kim Reynolds warned that federal waivers exempting oil companies from using renewable fuels are hurting the state\u2019s rural economy. \u201cWe continue to see farmers that are impacted,\u201d Reynolds said at a weekly meeting with reporters. \u201cWe continue to see ethanol plants that are being idled\u2026 Roy Strom, CEO of W2 Fuel, said Tuesday he is closing the company\u2019s 10-million gallon biodiesel plant in Crawfordsville in southeast Iowa, along with a plant in Michigan, given growing losses.\n\nRay Strom is a businessman in the private sector so I\u2019m happy to take him at his word. If he has calculated that there isn\u2019t enough demand for his ethanol to keep his business profitable, then shutting down (at least temporarily) was no doubt his only option.\n\nHe\u2019s blaming the EPA (and President Trump\u2019s policies) for the closure of his plant. And in at least one regard, he has a valid complaint, but he\u2019s looking at the wrong president. If Strom wants to blame someone, he should take it up with George W. Bush, because that\u2019s the guy who put the RFS into place originally and created this situation.\n\nStrom is angry about the reduction in market demand for his ethanol. But what he\u2019s failing to admit is that there was never a real demand for the amount of ethanol that\u2019s being produced in the midwest to begin with. There\u2019s certainly a market for some ethanol, but nowhere near the amounts that are currently being pumped out. W2 Fuel and its competitors have been growing wealthy by selling a product to oil refineries that they neither want nor need.\n\nThe RFS created an artificial market demand for ethanol that wouldn\u2019t exist without the government holding a gun to the heads of the refineries and forcing them to blend this poor quality fuel into the nation\u2019s gasoline supply. Failing to do that means they either have to buy ruinously expensive Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits or face massive government fines.\n\nThe government offering waivers to older, smaller refineries that aren\u2019t set up to blend ethanol in the mandated quantities was a charitable act intended to save them from bankruptcy. But that same benefit should be offered to all refineries by doing away with the RFS entirely. Will that hurt the ethanol plants like Mr. Stroms? Yes, it will. But they were never operating on a fair playing field to begin with. The RFS distorted the free market in obscene ways, and now that meddling is coming back to haunt any number of people.", "description": "Ever heard of the free market? No?
