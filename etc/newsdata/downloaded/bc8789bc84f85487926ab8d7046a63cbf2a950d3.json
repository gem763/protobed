Assets under its management rose by 3 per cent to \u00a3101.8billion, helped by rises in the stock market.\n\nHargreaves blamed Brexit, political uncertainty and the ongoing trade war for 'weak investor sentiment'\n\nNew business increased to \u00a31.7billion in the quarter, from \u00a31.3billion in the same period in 2018.\n\nBut the company warned: 'We have, however, seen new business in the period being impacted by weak investor sentiment arising from continuing Brexit and political uncertainty in the UK and wider global macro issues such as trade tariffs.'\n\nIt also said that following a period of heightened investment over the two previous years, it is now 'deliberately moderating the rate of investment'.\n\nShares in Hargreaves Lansdown were down by around 2 per cent at \u00a317.80 towards the close on Thursday. They are down about 10 per cent in the last six months.\n\nThis all comes soon after the investing platform announced the removal of its exit charges last month in the wake of pressure on the industry.\n\nIt also waived fees for the near-300,000 Hargreaves investors who have around \u00a31.6billion in assets trapped in the Woodford Equity Income Fund.\n\nHargreaves had backed the fund manager since he launched his own firm in 2014, channelling many millions of pounds of its clients' money into his funds.\n\nDespite Woodford's dismal performance over the past two years, Hargreaves continued to recommend his fund through its buy list until it was suspended in June.", "description": "Hargreaves Lansdown saw a rise in clients and assets in the last quarter, despite its ties to Neil Woodford, but warned that new business was hit by 'weak investor sentiment'.", "authors": ["Camilla Canocchi For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
