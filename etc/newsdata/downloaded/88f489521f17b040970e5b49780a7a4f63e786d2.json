Our music is saying something. - Jeremy Dutcher\n\nThe committee noted broader conversations have questioned the purpose of the Indigenous category at all.\n\n\"We feel strongly that this change will eliminate a lot of the confusion and put us in a better position to explain the need for the category, when challenged,\" the organization said in a statement.\n\nCategory renamed numerous times\n\nSince its introduction in 1994, the Indigenous category has undergone many changes.\n\nOriginally called the best music of Aboriginal Canada recording, it was renamed numerous times before the Junos settled on Aboriginal album of the year in 2010.\n\nTwo years ago, a committee of Juno organizers moved to rename the category Indigenous music album, in order to reflect the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples a year earlier.\n\nBut its foundation has been seen by some critics as a way to silo Indigenous artists into their own category.\n\nEarlier this year, best Indigenous music album winner Jeremy Dutcher used his acceptance speech at a Junos industry gala to ask his fellow nominees to stand and be recognized.\n\n\"All of your work changes this place, and it deserves to be considered outside of this category,\" he said.\n\n\"Because our music is not niche. Our music is saying something.\"", "description": "Juno Awards organizers are shaking up the Indigenous music category in hopes of putting a bigger spotlight on the artists.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5059886.1570034136!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/jeremy-dutcher-junos-2019.jpg"}
