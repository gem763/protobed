Nobody lives on the island and visitors need a permit to land.\n\nSo when conservationists who occasionally paddle across on kayaks to carry out seabird surveys began spotting brightly coloured elastic bands \u2013 thousands of them \u2013 there was a little bit of head-scratching.\n\nHad they washed ashore from a wreck or could it be that someone was playing a practical joke? Might they have been to do with the film crew that once shot an Agatha Christie adaptation there?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A few of the thousands of old elastic bands, together with parts of green fishing net, found by conservationists on Mullion island.

The bands had then been regurgitated by the birds on the island.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Depressing sign of the times: a pellet of undigested food containing a new yellow elastic band, collected from Mullion island.

To avoid disturbing the birds, they usually kept their trips short and so did not realise just how many bands were there.\n\nAfter this year\u2019s breeding season, though, the group decided to paddle over and take a closer look.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Grantham said he thought the birds had been collecting the bands for decades. Photograph: National Trust/Seth Jackson/PA\n\n\u201cWe were puzzled why there were so many and how they\u2019d got there,\u201d said Grantham. \u201cTo save disturbing the nesting birds, we made a special trip over to clear the litter. Within an hour we\u2019d collected thousands of bands and handfuls of fishing waste.\n\n\u201cThe gull breeding season was disappointingly poor in 2019. These human pressures are doing nothing to help our seabirds.\u201d\n\nSome of the bands were new and bright, others faded and brittle. Grantham said he thought the birds had been collecting them for decades.\n\nMullion island Mullion island\n\nAs well as the bands, small bundles of green fishing net and twine were also uncovered among the undigested food, likely mistaken by the gulls for tasty morsels floating on the sea surface. They also found a dead gull with a fishing hook it its gullet.\n\nRachel Holder, area ranger for the National Trust, said: \u201cIngested plastic and rubber is another factor in a long list of challenges which our gulls and other seabirds must contend with just to survive.\n\n\u201cDespite being noisy and boisterous and seemingly common, gulls are on the decline. They\u2019re already struggling with changes to fish populations and disturbance to nesting sites \u2013 and eating elastic bands and fishing waste does nothing to ease their plight.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest As well as the bands, small bundles of green fishing net and twine were also uncovered among the undigested food.

Before the first world war, pilchard companies posted sentries on the island to look out for the dark patches in the sea that indicated shoals of fish.\n\nNow the island is home to one of the largest colonies of great black-backed gulls in Cornwall, with up to 70 nests each summer, plus 50 cormorant nests.\n\nLanding is prohibited except for researchers with permission. Ornithologists from West Cornwall Ringing Group visit to monitor the populations of gulls and cormorants, and to colour-ring their chicks to follow their movements.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The National Trust is calling on businesses to consider how they dispose of materials that could cause harm to wildlife.

The trust is calling on businesses to consider how they dispose of materials that could cause harm to wildlife.\n\nLizzy Carlyle, the head of environmental practices at the National Trust, said: \u201cSingle-use materials are having an alarming impact on our country\u2019s most remote places. It\u2019s up to all of us to take responsibility for how we use and dispose of these items \u2013 whether we\u2019re producers or consumers.\u201d\n\nGull populations are on the decline, with the herring gull \u2013 the species notorious for pinching food from unassuming tourists \u2013 appearing on the UK Red List of Birds of Conservation Concern.", "description": "Seabird conservationists perplexed by discoveries on Mullion island work out depressing explanation", "authors": ["Steven Morris"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3522f447cb696625e9c6ab2d7965ad13e69199b/0_0_2121_1273/master/2121.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ca7840f4a48049cad8e726782fab898a", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
