Heading into Sunday night, Netflix's \"When They See Us\" was a favorite to win the award for best limited series, but lost to its biggest competition, HBO's \"Chernobyl.\"\n\nPrime Video dominated the comedy category, including a best comedy series win for \"Fleabag,\" beating Netflix's \"Russian Doll.\"\n\nREAD MORE: We compared Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and HBO to find the best service for every kind of viewer\n\nBut Netflix makes up for those losses in other ways and doesn't necessarily need a series Emmy win to prove its worth.\n\nWith over 150 million subscribers worldwide, 60 million of which are in the US, Netflix is the streaming champion. And its TV library is still stronger than most of its competition.\n\nNetflix has 1,966 total shows available to stream, second only to Prime Video in terms of streaming services, according to data from streaming search-engine Reelgood provided to Business Insider. Netflix has the most original shows of its competition by far and is expected to spend up to $15 billion this year on content.\n\n\"When They See Us\" Netflix\n\nAnd when it comes to high-quality TV shows, Hulu and Netflix are neck-and-neck, according to the data.
