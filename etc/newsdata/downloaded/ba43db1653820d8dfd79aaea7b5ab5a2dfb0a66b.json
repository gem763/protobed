Her 49 World Cup singles wins are another record, and she's one of two sliders to win seven consecutive World Cup points titles \u2014 Austria's Markus Prock took the men's championships each year from 1990-91 through 1996-97.\n\nSeason of change\n\nGeisenberger's break from sliding only adds to how the World Cup standings \u2014 and the German roster \u2014 will look very different this season. Dajana Eitberger, who was fourth in last season's World Cup standings, is also pregnant and expecting a baby in February. And Tatjana Huefner, who was sixth overall last season, has retired.\n\nHuefner won five consecutive World Cup points titles before Geisenberger took over and began her seven-year streak of championships.
