The latter has become a particular point of interest in recent weeks, following President Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Democrats say Trump \u201cpressured\u201d Ukraine to investigate his potential rival, Biden, who played a key role in the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating Burisma Holdings. Hunter Biden served on the board, making $83,000 per month, despite a stunning lack of qualifications for such a position. The former vice president wanted the prosecutor fired and threatened to withhold $1 billion in aid, bragging about his ultimatum last year.\n\n\u201cI said, I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you\u2019re not getting the billion. I\u2019m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours,\u201d Biden said during an appearance at the Council on Foreign Relations in 2018.\n\n\u201cI looked at them and said: I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. He got fired,\u201d he boasted.\n\nThe Biden campaign, however, is warning fellow candidates to refrain from taking a shot at the Bidens\u2019 business dealings in China and Ukraine, and specifically the role that Hunter played.\n\nA Biden aide warned anyone who \u201ccalls themselves a \u2018Democrat\u2019\u201d from pushing the \u201cdiscredited lies.\u201d If they choose to do so, they \u201cwould be making a profound statement about themselves,\u201d the aide said, according to Bloomberg.", "description": "The Biden campaign is warning any presidential candidate who \"calls themselves a Democrat\" to refrain from repeating \"discredited lies.\"", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1180317266-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
