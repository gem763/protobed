More than three decades later, she\u2019s somehow able to forgive him.\n\n\u201cI needed to do it so that I could be happy,\u201d Moorer told CBS This Morning.\n\nView photos Allison Moorer opens up about a traumatic childhood event.

Their mother, Lynn, had finally left their abusive, alcoholic father, Franklin, and they were living in a rental home. On the morning of Aug. 12, he visited the house, and the girls heard shots.\n\n\u201cI think he just broke,\u201d Moorer said.\n\nShe\u2019s written about the life-changing event and the aftermath in a new memoir, Blood, and a companion album of the same title. Now 47, Moorer said she was compelled to go back and research her family, so that she could figure out the reason behind what she went through.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still trying not to be the daughter of a murderer,\u201d she wrote in her book. \u201cI\u2019m still trying not to be the daughter of an abused and murdered woman. I\u2019m still trying to redeem them.\u201d\n\nMoorer, who was nominated for an Oscar for a song in the 1998 movie \u201cThe Horse Whisperer,\u201d has placed keepsakes from her parents throughout her home in Nashville.\n\n\u201cMy mama was a great mama. And she is why I\u2019m okay. She is why my sister is okay,\u201d Moorer said.\n\nView photos Allison Moorer, left, and sister Shelby Lynne, right, at the 2017 Americana Music Association Honors & Awards in 2017.

For a time, they were all either of them had.\n\n\u201cShe never ever let me believe that I was not loved,\u201d Moorer said of her mother Lynn.\n\nWhile Moorer also feels \u201cnothing but love\u201d for her father today, it took a few things to get to that point.\n\n\u201cTime. Investigation. Willingness, and having a little boy,\u201d she said.\n\nMoorer is already thinking about how she\u2019ll one day explain the family\u2019s complicated history to her son, John Henry, who has autism.\n\nShe\u2019ll tell him \u201cthat his grandparents were troubled and beautiful, like we all are.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
