She used the event at Keene State College to counter questions about her viability in a general election, a concern that nags many Democrats, who worry that she would be carved up by President Donald Trump.\n\nSome in the party, including women, are haunted by Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 defeat and worry that the country isn\u2019t ready to elect a woman.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the person that Trump would like for an opponent,\u201d Greg Griffin of Anamosa, Iowa, who attended an event for Pete Buttigieg in that state this week. \u201cHe\u2019ll jump all over her.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s rise is driven by growing support among liberals and college-educated white Democrats, and a modest but important boost among black voters, a vital constituency that Biden has dominated and Warren has struggled to reach.\n\nThe rally in Keene, a town of 25,000, showed the fiery and pugilistic persona Warren has cultivated as she channels Democrats\u2019 anger toward Trump and an economic system she argues has been hijacked by powerful entities to beat down legislation that\u2019s good for ordinary workers.\n\n\u201cDemocrats and Republicans \u2014 nobody likes the corruption,\u201d Warren said. \u201cNobody likes a government that has been bought and paid for by the rich.\u201d\n\nWarren said a fundamentally corrupt system had allowed drug companies to write health care legislation and the fossil fuel industry to block action on climate change. And she pitched her wealth tax as a way to finance universal child care and canceling student debt.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not pushing a wealth tax because I\u2019m cranky with rich people. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not,\u201d she said, before mocking the wealthy who complain about high taxes. \u201c\u2018I worked hard! I stayed up late!\u2019 \u2014 yeah, unlike anybody else,\u201d she said.\n\nA Monmouth University poll released Tuesday had her leading the field in New Hampshire, which holds the second nominating contest, with 27%, statistically tied with Biden\u2019s 25%. Her support has risen by double-digits since May, while Biden\u2019s fell by double digits.\n\nBernie Sanders, who enjoyed a crushing victory in New Hampshire with 60% of the vote in the 2016 Democratic primary, was in third place, at 12%. He is also courting the most progressive voters with a message of taxing the rich and expanding the safety net.\n\nIn Iowa, where the first-in-the-nation contest is held, a CNN/Des Moines Register survey found Warren leading with 22% while Biden had 20%. Warren\u2019s support rose by 7 points since June, while Biden\u2019s support fell by 4 points.\n\nA UC Berkeley poll of California, a delegate-rich early contest that begins early voting on the day of the Iowa caucuses, also found Warren leading the Democratic race with 29%, ahead of Biden\u2019s 22% and Sanders\u2019 19%. Kamala Harris, the state\u2019s junior senator, had 8%.\n\nIn addition, Warren found herself atop the field nationally for the first time in a Quinnipiac survey released Wednesday. She carried 27% of Democratic voters while Biden had 25% \u2014 her lead was within the margin or error, but in the last month Warren rose by 8 points while Biden fell by 8.\n\nMost notably, Warren appears to be gaining with black voters, a constituency that has picked every Democratic winner in presidential contests since 1992. Her support among African Americans nearly doubled from 10% to 19% in the Quinnipiac poll, while Biden\u2019s dipped from 46% to a still-strong 40%.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday used her first rally as a front-runner in the Democratic presidential race to assure a crowd in a small New Hampshire town that her brand of progressive politics made her the most viable candidate.\u201cThere\u2019s a whole bunch of core issues, like raising the minimum", "authors": ["Sahil Kapur"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/awzBWg2q8Bm.TTaM6y94hA--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/8afa1deec073ad924a726bbe300ec1b1", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
