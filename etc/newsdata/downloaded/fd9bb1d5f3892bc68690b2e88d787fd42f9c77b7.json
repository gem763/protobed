But the phase-by-phase approach creates other uncertainties.\n\nNegotiators have left the issue of China\u2019s forced technology transfers to Phase Two, which Trump said he wants to start negotiating after Phase One is \u201ccompleted and signed\". He continued that \u201cthere may be a phase three or we may get it [the forced technology transfer issue] done in phase two. So you\u2019ll either have two phases or three phases.\u201d\n\nMultiple issues the US has long complained about did not emerge publicly during this round of talks, including China\u2019s generous subsidies to state-owned enterprises (SOEs), alleged intellectual property theft, and the huge trade deficit between the two countries.\n\nIf negotiators fail to deliver resolutions on these tough issues, then the agreed Phase One and Two could be voided. This possibility cannot be ruled out; Beijing and Washington should move together cautiously.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that China has not endorsed Trump\u2019s wording around reaching a Phase One deal. The Chinese Commerce Ministry only said \u201cthe two sides also discussed the arrangement for future consultations, and agreed to make joint efforts toward eventually reaching an agreement\".\n\nAt a June press conference in Beijing, the commerce ministry\u2019s spokesman, Gao Feng, actually used the words: \u201cNothing is agreed until everything is agreed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was responding to the US claim that talks had collapsed in May because China had backtracked on its promises. Gao accused the US of dishonesty and of unilaterally increasing tensions. \u201cIf the US insists on unilateralism and wants to force China to yield, this will never succeed,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Trump looks to be in urgent need of a deal. He said on Friday (Saturday AEDT) that he wants a \u201cfast and clean\u201d agreement that does not need the congressional approval. \u201cOne of the great things about the China Deal is the fact that, for various reasons, we do not have to go through the very long and politically complex Congressional Approval Process,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWhen the deal is fully negotiated, I sign it myself on behalf of our Country. Fast and Clean!\u201d\n\nIf Trump thinks he will not need congressional approval for such a trade deal, he is wrong. His confidence seems to come from a piece of \u201cfast-track\u201d legislation, the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), negotiated between his predecessor, President Barack Obama, and the previous 115th US Congress, to facilitate the talks of Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), then the mega-trade deal covering 12 Asia-Pacific countries.\n\nThat legislation allows trade deals to be brought to a direct vote without lengthy debate in Congress \u2014 a fast-track mandate that can save tremendous time. But it does not skirt such a vote.\n\nTrump\u2019s White House had successfully sought an extension of the fast-track mandate, but any deal will still be subject to a Congressional vote, because the authority to approve trade deals with foreign governments lies in the Congress.\n\nIf the US Congress does not like the final deal and ultimately vetoes it, it will be as though nothing was agreed at all.\n\nLu Zhenhua joined Caixin Global as senior editor in August.
