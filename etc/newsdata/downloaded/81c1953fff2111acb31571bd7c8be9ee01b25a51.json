In fact, the 55-year-old actor even went as far as to call it \u201cthe best thing that ever happened\u201d to him in a recent appearance on on SiriusXM\u2019s \u201cThe Jess Cagle Show,\u201d Page Six reported.\n\nThis is great news, because in these sex-positive times there\u2019s no reason anyone one should be ashamed of making a consensual sex tape. Unless of course it was with an underage girl, which happens to be exactly what Lowe did. The actor was 24 back when he idiotically filmed himself having sex with a 16-year-old girl.\n\nThe incident caused a stir, becoming a major Hollywood scandal that temporarily put Lowe\u2019s career on hold.\n\nHowever, before we hail Lowe as a sex-positive icon then double back and condemn him for proudly flaunting his past as a literal sexual predator, it should be noted that the reason he\u2019s looking back so fondly on his 30-year-old sex tape is because he credits the scandal with putting him on the path to sobriety.\n\n\u201cIt got me sober,\u201d he said on the show. \u201cSober got me married. I\u2019ve been married 29 years and I have two great sons, so I don\u2019t think any of that happens without going through that scandal.\u201d\n\nSome might argue that there are in fact people who get sober without first filming themselves having sex with a teen, but to each their own.\n\nUltimately, it seems like Lowe\u2019s only regret is that he was too early to the sex tape trend, and couldn\u2019t monetize it a la early-aughts adopters Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian. \u201cThe problem was, I didn\u2019t make any money off of it like everybody does now,\u201d Lowe told Cagle. Again, not entirely sure that\u2019s what the problem was with that whole thing, but good for Rob Lowe?\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at Page Six", "description": "The actor opened up about the 1988 scandal that temporarily halted his career, crediting the sex tape incident for putting him on the path to sobriety.", "authors": ["Kayla Kibbe"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Rob_Lowe.jpg?fit=1200%2C800", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
