The applications will be heard in court on Sept 30, when the previous extension expires.\n\nIn August, Hyflux said that a definitive agreement for the rescue deal had not been entered into with Utico, pending resolution on \"certain final outstanding issues\" in the draft definitive agreements.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nUtico had earlier agreed to take an 88 per cent stake in Hyflux through a S$300 million equity injection and a S$100 million shareholder loan.\n\nMr Gerald said on Saturday that should a deal with Utico not be reached, the further two-month extension on the moratorium will also allow Hyflux to pursue discussions with the other interested investors.\n\nThe creditors are still able to apply for leave to bring an end to the debt moratorium if they are not satisfied with the progress of negotiations. \u201cSIAS agrees that there will be no prejudice caused to the creditors,\u201d noted Mr Gerald, who has written several open letters and opinion pieces on the drama unfolding at the former market darling.\n\nAt a Sept 16 meeting, Hyflux directors updated SIAS on the efforts undertaken by the company to secure an investor. SIAS is \u201cencouraged\u201d by Hyflux\u2019s efforts in its negotiations with potential investors and the progress achieved with Utico, Mr Gerald said.\n\nDuring that meeting, Hyflux also informed SIAS of the reasons why the company would not be applying for leave to convene a scheme meeting this week as previously intended. Instead, Hyflux applied for the two-month extension on its debt moratorium.\n\n\u201cSIAS did impress upon Hyflux\u2019s board to do their best to arrive at a satisfactory resolution for Hyflux\u2019s stakeholders,\u201d Mr Gerald said in his statement on Saturday.\n\nShares in Hyflux have been suspended from trading since May last year.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Companies & Markets - THE Securities Investors Association (Singapore) (SIAS) is seeking an update on debt-ridden water firm Hyflux\u2019s restructuring. .
