Polls will remain open in far western British Columbia until 0200 GMT Tuesday, although the first results are expected starting at 2300 GMT.\n\nSome 27.4 million Canadians are eligible to elect 338 members of parliament after a tense and sometimes bitter election campaign.\n\nCampaigning ended as it began some 40 days earlier, with polls showing a near perfect equilibrium.\n\nNeither the Liberals nor the Conservatives \u2014 the parties that have led Canada since Confederation in 1867 \u2014 is forecast to win enough support to secure an absolute majority of seats in parliament.\n\n\u2013 Faded golden boy \u2013\n\nAt final campaign stops in westernmost British Columbia on Sunday, former golden boy Trudeau made an emotional appeal to voters to enable him to build on the achievements of his first term.\n\nHe warned against Scheer\u2019s pledged rollback of environmental protections including a federal carbon tax that discourages the use of large amounts of fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cWe need a strong, progressive government that will unite Canadians and fight climate change \u2014 not a progressive opposition,\u201d Trudeau told a rally in a suburb of Vancouver after whistle-stops in Ontario, Manitoba and Alberta.\n\n\u201cWe need to unite as citizens. We need to unite as a planet.\u201d\n\nAfter winning in a 2015 landslide \u2014 in a repeat of the wave of support that in 1968 carried his late father Pierre to power \u2014 Trudeau\u2019s star has dimmed while in office.\n\nHis image has been tainted by ethics lapses in the handling of the bribery prosecution of an engineering giant, while his campaign was rocked by the emergence of old photographs of him in blackface make-up.\n\nSurging social democrats and resuscitated Quebec separatists have also chipped away at Liberal support.\n\n\u2013 Main parties both struggle \u2013\n\nIf Trudeau hangs on, it will be because Scheer has struggled to win over Canadians with his bland minivan-driving dad persona and a throwback to the thrifty policies of past Tory administrations.\n\nCanadians \u201ccannot afford\u201d a Liberal government propped up by the third-place New Democratic Party (NDP), Scheer said at the end of a marathon last push from the Atlantic to Pacific oceans.\n\n\u201cWe can only imagine what the NDP\u2019s price would be to keep Justin Trudeau in power,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhatever it is, we know Trudeau would pay any price to stay in power and he\u2019d use your money to do it.\u201d\n\nCampaign attack ads have included false accusations that Liberals would legalize hard drugs and the Tories would allow the proliferation of assault weapons.\n\nAt one rally, Trudeau was forced to wear a bulletproof vest.\n\nAlong the bruising way, Trudeau and Scheer traded barbs.\n\nTrudeau evoked the bogeymen of past and current Tory parties fostering \u201cpolitics of fear and division\u201d and Scheer called the prime minister a \u201ccompulsive liar,\u201d \u201ca phoney and a fraud.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Trudeau defends record \u2013\n\nTrudeau defended his record: a strong economy and low unemployment, legal cannabis, the resettlement of 60,000 Syrian refugees, doctor-assisted deaths, a public inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women, and free trade deals with Europe, Pacific nations and North American neighbors.\n\nFormer US president Barack Obama endorsed Trudeau, calling him an \u201ceffective leader who takes on big issues like climate change.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe world needs his progressive leadership now,\u201d Obama said in a tweet.\n\nThe Conservatives, meanwhile, have stood alone among all of the parties in pledging austerity measures to return to a balanced budget within five years.\n\nScheer was shaken late in the campaign over revelations of his US dual citizenship and allegations that his party hired a communications firm to \u201cdestroy\u201d the upstart People\u2019s Party, led by former Conservative foreign minister Maxime Bernier.\n\nThe party has situated itself to the right of the Conservatives and could draw votes away.\n\nOn the left, the Bloc has come back from a ruinous 2015 election result, tapping into lingering Quebec nationalism to challenge the Liberals\u2019 dominance in the province.\n\nThe Bloc and NDP have said they would not prop up the Tories if they secure a minority.\n\nWho will govern may still be unclear for weeks after the polls close during alliance negotiations that could keep Trudeau in office even if his party loses.", "description": "Ottawa (AFP) \u2013 Canadians began voting in a general election Monday, with surveys predicting a minority government as Prime Minister Justin", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/21/d558b4_leader-liberal-party-canada-prime-minister-justin-trudeau-is-on-brink-an-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
