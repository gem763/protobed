The feature will deliver news from 200 sources, including Breitbart News, to users of the social network. The company will also fund a selection of the 200 news sources, although it won\u2019t say which ones or how much.\n\nThe list of 200 sources includes mostly mainstream news sources, including USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, The New York Times, Cond\u00e9 Nast, Hearst, Business Insiders, and NBC. Some conservative outlets, including Breitbart News and Fox News, are also on the list.\n\nContent from the 200 sources will be delivered to users via Facebook\u2019s new \u201cNews Tab.\u201d The content will in part be manually curated by a team of in-house journalists at the social network.\n\nMark Zuckerberg hosted publishers at an event in New York yesterday as part of the feature\u2019s rollout, which will initially be to a limited number of users.\n\nAssociated Press reports that some \u2013 not all \u2013 of the 200 publishers will be paid \u201cmillions of dollars in some cases\u201d for content, although Facebook has again remained silent about the details, saying only that it will pay \u201ca range of publishers for access to all of their content.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear how Facebook decided which of the 200 publishers to pay, what they are paying for, or how the company came to its decisions.\n\nIn a press release, Facebook VP of Global News Partnerships, Campbell Brown, said: \u201cWe talked to news organizations about what they\u2019d like to see included in a news tab, how their stories should be presented and what analytics to provide.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wanted to build this product in a consultative way, sharing our ideas and getting input from the industry,\u201d wrote Brown.\n\nEligible publishers must be in Facebook\u2019s News Page Index, and must meet a \u201crange of integrity signals in determining product eligibility, including misinformation \u2014 as identified based on third-party fact checkers \u2014 community standards violations (e.g., hate speech), clickbait, engagement bait and others.\u201d\n\nFacebook has revealed a list of Facebook News\u2019s features, which will include:\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s Stories,\u201d a selection of news stories for users picked by a team of journalists. (This may generate further questions about Facebook acting like a publisher, a point that has been regularly raised by members of congress and senators).\n\nPersonalization, that will send Facebook News readers new stories and sources based on what they have previously read, shared, or followed.\n\nControls that allow users to hide topics and publishers they don\u2019t want to see.\n\nIn addition to paying publishers directly, Facebook News will link to publishers\u2019 websites and apps, where they can collect ad revenue from readers.\n\nIn a tweet, USA Today said Facebook is making an effort to \u201chighlight news from trusted and credible publishers.\u201d\n\nIn efforts to highlight news from trusted and credible publishers, Facebook has enlisted USA TODAY, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, and other news organizations to lead the Facebook News Tab. https://t.co/kG4U3wTz6x \u2014 USA TODAY (@USATODAY) October 25, 2019\n\nThe New York Times, which is one of the publishers Facebook handpicked to feature in its new section, reported the new feature as a \u201ctruce with publishers,\u201d which have long attacked the social network for damaging the news industry.\n\nA New York Times spokeswoman told Ad Age that \u201cFacebook is taking a welcome first step toward recognizing the differential value of New York Times journalism.\u201d\n\nAre you an insider at Google, Facebook, Twitter or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?
