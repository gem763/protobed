It\u2019s okay to disassociate. It\u2019s okay to hide from the world,\u2019 it read. \u2018It\u2019s okay to need help. It\u2019s okay not to be okay. Your mental illness is not a personal failure.\u2019\n\nShe shared a message about mental health (Picture: Instagram/beckyvardy)\n\nThe 37-year-old added praise hands emojis to the post, and added: \u2018For anyone that is struggling.\u2019\n\nIt comes after she mocked her former friend in a tweet which saw her celebrating her husband\u2019s success on the football field as Leicester City FC scooped up a record-breaking win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo the surprise of many, Rebekah broke her social media silence by tweeting: \u2018It\u2019s\u2026\u2026 Jamie Vardy #9.\u2019\n\nThe choice of an ellipsis was also used by Coleen at the end of her dramatic statement in which she alleged that Rebekah had been selling stories to newspapers about the Rooney family.\n\nRooney made the accusations on Instagram, alleging that she set up a plot to expose her fellow WAG by only allowing one account access to fake stories she was sharing, and that account was Rebekah\u2019s.\n\n\u2018I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It\u2019s\u2026\u2026 Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account,\u2019 she shared on 9 October.\n\nMeanwhile, Becky strongly denied the claims when she fired back in a statement of her own.\n\n\u2018As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this,\u2019 she wrote. \u2018I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me to over the years can vouch for.\n\n\u2018If you thought this was happening you could have told me and I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped.\n\n\u2018Over the years various people have had access to my insta & just this week I found I was following people I didn\u2019t know and have never followed myself.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe added: \u2018I\u2019m not being funny but I don\u2019t need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you?\n\n\u2018I like you a lot Coleen & I\u2019m so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I\u2019m heavily pregnant.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m disgusted that I\u2019m even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
