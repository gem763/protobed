The events that followed her shooting have unfolded in ways that are both typical and unique, leaving her family and activists to balance hope with caution.\n\nThe officer who shot her, Aaron Dean, was taken into custody two days after the killing. Jefferson\u2019s family had been calling for an arrest.\n\n\u201cWe would want them to move as swiftly as they move when it\u2019s a black person who is accused of a crime,\u201d said attorney Benjamin Crump, who has represented several black families whose loved ones were killed by police officers in recent years. \u201cIt should not be any different if you have a gun or badge.\u201d\n\nJefferson, 28, was killed in the early hours after a neighbor saw the front door at Jefferson\u2019s house had been left open and called police. Jefferson had stayed up late playing a video game with her 8-year-old nephew, who saw her get shot.\n\nShe was shot through a back window by Dean, who was outside the home. Dean was not heard identifying himself as police on the bodycam video, and Interim Police Chief Ed Kraus has said there was no sign Dean or the other officer who responded even knocked on the front door.\n\nDean resigned before being charged with murder Monday.\n\nThe killing immediately sparked outrage and peaceful protests in Jefferson\u2019s Texas community, which was still reeling from last year\u2019s shooting death of 26-year-old Botham Jean, a black accountant from the Caribbean island nation of St. Lucia who was killed in his apartment by a white Dallas police officer who was his neighbor. The officer, Amber Guyger, was fired soon after the shooting and charged with murder.\n\nGuyger, who said she mistook Jean\u2019s apartment for her own, was convicted earlier this month \u2014 a rare jury decision \u2014 and sentenced to 10 years in prison, a punishment seen by some as too lenient for the crime.\n\nOn Monday, Fort Worth Mayor Betsy Price, who is white, penned a letter to the city expressing sadness and regret for Jefferson\u2019s death, an unusual move for a public official in such cases.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the entire city of Fort Worth \u2014 I am sorry,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cTo Atatiana\u2019s family \u2014 I am sorry. There is nothing to justify or explain what happened on Saturday morning. Nothing.\u201d\n\nPrice\u2019s letter also addressed James Smith, the concerned neighbor who called police, and Jefferson\u2019s nephew, who she asked the city to surround with prayers and support.\n\nBut even as the mayor and police chief were calling the shooting of Jefferson, a college graduate who was considering medical school, inexcusable, the inclusion of photos of a handgun found inside her home with the bodycam footage was seized upon by some as an effort to discredit her. Similarly, some reacted negatively to an arrest warrant that quoted Jefferson\u2019s nephew as saying his aunt pulled out a gun after hearing suspicious noises behind her house.\n\nPrice in her letter denounced the Police Department\u2019s initial mention of Jefferson\u2019s licensed handgun as \u201cirrelevant.\u201d\n\nJean was unarmed but authorities pointed out that he had marijuana in his apartment, which activists called an attempt to smear him. And after Brown was killed by white Ferguson officer Darren Wilson, police said the unarmed, black 18-year-old was suspected of stealing cigarillos from a convenience store before the shooting and they released surveillance video of Brown, which upset protesters.\n\nThere have been encouraging signs of transparency in the handling of Jefferson\u2019s killing, with police releasing the bodycam footage and Dean\u2019s name to the public on Monday, said Villanova sociologist Jill McCorkel, author of \u201cBreaking Women: Gender, Race and the New Politics of Imprisonment.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical that those names are released right away,\u201d said McCorkel, whose work focuses on police violence against women.\n\n\u201cIf Jefferson had shot first, her name would\u2019ve been released to the press immediately,\u201d she added. \u201cWe should have the same balance of accountability, particularly because police are public servants acting in all of our names.\u201d\n\nFort Worth police have had six deadly force shootings since June, and activists have been pushing for reform in the city for several years. Civil litigation attorney Geoffrey Fieger said some law enforcement agencies now appear to be responding appropriately and firing officers involved in misconduct.\n\n\u201cIn the past, (police departments) didn\u2019t even fire them,\u201d said Fieger, a Detroit-based lawyer who represented the family of 7-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones. The family sued the city and was awarded more than $8 million after she was shot to death during a 2010 police raid at her home while sleeping on a sofa.\n\nWhile Dean wasn\u2019t fired, Kraus said he would\u2019ve been had he not stepped down voluntarily.\n\nJason C. Johnson, president of the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund, said caution should be taken while the facts are still being investigated.\n\n\u201cThere is tremendous pressure on mayors and prosecutors and police chiefs to take dramatic and very swift and harsh action on cases that target this type of attention,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cNormally, these cases will be reviewed more exhaustingly.\u201d\n\nSome are already skeptical that they will see Dean held accountable in a courtroom, an outcome not often seen in cases where the officer is a defendant.\n\nLouis LaFleur, a 68-year-old retired school custodian who lives a block from Jefferson\u2019s home, said he has little faith in the criminal justice system in the case.\n\n\u201cWhatever they\u2019re going to do, they\u2019re going to do it,\u201d said LaFleur, who is black. \u201cHe\u2019s the lawman. He\u2019s got people behind him all the way. We don\u2019t have that.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jake Bleiberg in Fort Worth and Nomaan Merchant in Houston contributed.
