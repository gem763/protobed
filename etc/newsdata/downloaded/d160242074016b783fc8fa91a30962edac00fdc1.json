However, upon pulling the banana from its stem, an upset Swift says, \"That wasn't the one I wanted.\" Swift begins to cry as she explains to her mother she wanted a different banana. When her mother tells her she will eat the banana Swift didn't want, Swift says, \"But it doesn't have a head.\" Swift eventually accepts it, saying that \"sometimes it doesn't go your way,\" and, later, Swift's mom captures the singer almost falling asleep while eating her banana.\n\n\"Don't fall asleep eating a banana,\" Swift's mom tells her. Swift responds, \"I'm not asleep. My mind is alive.\"\n\nComing back from the clip, Swift's jaw was dropped. \"That's on television,\" Swift pointed out. \"She was kind enough to drive me there, but cruel enough to film it and give it to you?\"\n\nBack in August, a video of an intoxicated Swift celebrating her MTV VMA nominations surfaced, which sparked \"Drunk Taylor\" memes to go viral on social media. So, Swift was a little worried about what might happen now with the release of her banana meltdown. \"So I was at a party, like a couple months ago, and I had like two and a half mojitos.And then, the next day, #DrunkTaylor was like number one trending on Twitter,\" Swift explained. \"Thinking about the fact that that went as far as it did, and then we've got this happening. That you've done this now.\"\n\nLuckily, in the end, Swift wasn't mad at her mom or Fallon. \"I can't even be mad. I'm just impressed that you infiltrated my family. I don't even know how you did that. Nobody has my mom's number.\"\n\nThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon airs weeknights at 11:35 p.m. on NBC.\n\nCheck out Taylor Swift using her Teen Choice Icon Award speech to urge fans to stand up for gender equality:\n\nRead more from Yahoo!
