But the summer transfer saga between prospective buyer Barcelona and hard-nosed seller PSG turned into a \u201cWill he, won\u2019t he stay?\u201d soap opera where Barcelona did most of the talking with little effect.\n\nIt was not until Friday night, after PSG won 2-0 at Metz without a physically fit Neymar, that PSG\u2019s sporting director Leonardo effectively said a deal would almost certainly not be reached. That is unless a dramatic turnaround happens in the few hours remaining before the window shuts.\n\n\u201cWe always said that, if we were happy with an offer, we were ready to let him leave,\u201d Leonardo said. \u201cThat offer never arrived.\u201d\n\nThere were several reported offers for the Brazil star, including Barcelona sending winger Ousmane Dembele to PSG on loan as part of a cash-plus-players deal with Croatia midfielder Ivan Rakitic also joining PSG along with 130 million euros.\n\nBut Leonardo said Barcelona\u2019s Dembele offer came far too late on Aug. 27, and by Saturday night speculation was winding down amid online reports Neymar was resigned to staying.\n\nLosing Neymar would have given PSG coach Thomas Tuchel precious little time to recruit a top-level striker. It has understandably been a frustrating season so far for Tuchel, with Neymar physically ready to play after two injury-hit seasons yet apparently sidelined in case a Barcelona move happened.\n\n\u201cThings in the world of football are crazy, anything can happen,\u201d Tuchel said recently with an air of resignation. \u201cThe coach doesn\u2019t decide everything in a big club with a big-name player like that.\u201d\n\nIt promises to be a difficult month for PSG, which will likely face Real Madrid in the first group game of the Champions League on Sept. 18 without a top-class striker and then travels to seven-time French champion Lyon four days later.\n\nNeymar is available to face Lyon - if he stays - but is suspended for the first three games of the Champions League. Edinson Cavani (hip) and Kylian Mbappe (thigh) are expected to be out for a few weeks and will probably miss both key matches.\n\nPSG could find itself facing 13-time European champion Madrid with an underwhelming strike force of Eric Maxim Choupou-Moting - who joined last season from unheralded English side Stoke - and Jese, who is back at PSG after loans to Las Palmas, Stoke and Real Betis produced just six goals in 43 games.\n\nJese\u2019s appearance as a 90th-minute substitute on Friday night against Metz was his first PSG appearance since scoring in a French Cup game in Dec. 2016.\n\nThe 26-year-old Spaniard arrived from Madrid four years ago amid high expectations, but is effectively now PSG\u2019s fifth-choice forward. It is ironic that PSG might need him against his former club in just over two weeks\u2019 time.\n\nQUESTIONS ASKED\n\nPSG\u2019s injury list includes defender Thilo Kehrer and midfielder Ander Herrera, raising questions about the club\u2019s pre-season preparations: Was a trip to China advisable given Mbappe and Cavani may have needed more rest? Is a change in the club\u2019s medical staff working? Have Tuchel\u2019s training sessions been too intense?\n\n\u201cI think it will be a difficult season, we have a lot of things to sort out,\u201d Leonardo said Friday night. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to say we\u2019re going to win the Champions League. Our ambitions haven\u2019t lessened but we have problems to deal with first.\u201d\n\nLeonardo\u2019s message is a refreshing change.\n\nPSG\u2019s players spoke brazenly in past seasons of being able to win the Champions League - this despite never even reaching the semifinals since Qatari backers QSI took charge eight years ago - but Leonardo is a far more measured voice and is clearly avoiding any grand-standing hype.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Neymar looks set to stay at Paris Saint-Germain as the clock ticks down on the French league's transfer window, which closes at midnight Monday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jerome Pugmire"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/02/france_soccer_weekend_watch_28863_c0-229-5472-3419_s1770x1032.jpg?6f9ce78ee1a3a25672569ab4bf84dc3559d8855e"}
