Such a command means the operator should stop the train and remain stationary.\n\nAD\n\nHowever, the operator of the striking train, for reasons that are unclear, then moved forward without having received permission from the rail operations control center, according to David Mayer, chief executive of the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no indication that there was that permission\u201d to move, Mayer said. \u201cWe know the train moved, and we know the train had a zero-speed command. At this moment, it isn\u2019t productive to get into the head of this operator or to understand this particular train operator.\u201d\n\nBrian Wivell, political organizer for Amalgamated Transit Union Local 689, which represents train operators, said the union would not comment until it had all the facts in the incident.\n\nAD\n\nMetro spokesman Dan Stessel said both operators are being held from driving duties, which is standard procedure during a crash investigation. He said Metro hasn\u2019t announced any findings that point to a cause of the crash.\n\nThe incident involved out-of-service trains returning to their respective rail yards after having provided special late-night service following the Washington Nationals\u2019 playoff game.\n\nAD\n\nAnd while there were no passengers aboard and the operators\u2019 injuries were minor, commission officials said the crash revealed a troubling flaw in Metro\u2019s safety controls that could affect future crashes involving potential operator error.\n\nMetro is under a \u201cCorrective Action Plan\u201d from the Federal Transit Administration to come up with a backup system to prevent trains from moving without authorization. The action plan, which was inherited by the safety commission when it assumed oversight from the FTA, was ordered to correct a flaw first revealed by a National Transportation Safety Board investigation seven years ago and the FTA in 2016.\n\nAD\n\nMetro has not completed the plan, the commission said.\n\n\u201c[The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority] has not fully implemented sufficient protections against the unauthorized movement of trains with zero speed commands,\u201d the commission said in a statement.\n\nAD\n\nThe commission said it plans to hold a \u201ctechnical summit\u201d with Metro about the issue. Mayer said he plans to discuss ways Metro technicians might be able to engineer an onboard security system that would force trains to stop and cede more direct control of them to the operations control center.\n\n\u201cThe focus of any safety investigation isn\u2019t blame,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cThe focus of a safety investigation is understanding what happened, trying our best to understand why it happened and most importantly working to prevent it. So that\u2019s where our focus is.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMetro said it\u2019s unaware of a transit system similar to Metro that has successfully implemented the type of technology Mayer raised.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201cunclear whether we will find a feasible solution,\u201d Stessel said, \u201cbut we will absolutely cooperate with [the safety commission] and participate in their engineering summit.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe crash occurred at 12:54 a.m. Monday, minutes after Metro had finished carrying fans home from the late-ending Nationals playoff game. One of the six-car 3000-series trains was headed back to the New Carrollton rail yard and the other was headed to a storage area behind the Largo Town Center Metro station, where they were to be prepared for the morning commute.\n\nAD\n\nBoth trains were on the same eastbound track when they received zero-speed commands from the Metro signal system because of a train ahead. Mayer said the command required both trains to wait for permission from the control center before resuming their trips. Once a stop command is given, an automatic train protection system limits the trains from going faster than 15 mph.\n\nMetro officials said Train 700 did momentarily stop before it continued forward and into the rear of Train 755 at 11 mph. Radio traffic and other transmissions show the driver did not get permission from the control center to press ahead, and Mayer said neither aging train had cameras onboard that record the nose of lead cars and the actions of drivers. The 3000-series rail cars are among Metro\u2019s oldest.\n\nAD\n\nThe lead car of Train 700 sustained \u201csubstantial damage\u201d to its exterior and all of its furnishings, Mayer said. Equipment under the train broke in the wreck, he added.\n\nAD\n\nInspections of the track, as well as logs and other evidence, showed that train controls and safety systems functioned properly, Mayer said.\n\n\u201cThe engineering elements in the system as far as the investigation has determined so far performed as they were supposed to be,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter being treated and released from hospitals, both train operators took routine toxicology tests and were interviewed by investigators. Mayer did not disclose what those interviews may have revealed but indicated that nothing showed the crash was purposeful.\n\n\u201cI have no reason to believe that this employee was anything other than any employee attempting to provide good train service and do what he thought was appropriate,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe commission\u2019s goal beyond determining cause is preventing future crashes, Mayer said. He told commission members he would ask Metro to convene engineers to see if an \u201cengineering backstop\u201d or security device like a numeric keypad could be installed on older series trains. The keypad would require an operator to get a code from the Rail Operations Control Center before a train could move while under system orders to halt.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not unique to Metrorail that a train can move under zero-speed commands,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cWhat we just want to make sure is that when a train is moving under zero-speed commands that it\u2019s done safely and appropriately.\u201d\n\nA keypad security system is slated to be added into Metro\u2019s latest model of trains, the 7000 series, but Mayer said he doesn\u2019t know if it could also be retrofitted into Metro\u2019s older rail cars such as the 3000 series.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMetro has several series of rail cars it uses to shuttle more than 600,000 passengers each weekday, including cars that date as far back as 1982.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to be with us for a while, and we want to understand if there\u2019s anything we can do to backstop the administrative command,\u201d he said.\n\nCommission Chair Christopher Hart said the panel is doing what it\u2019s supposed to do, proposing safety upgrades even before the crash investigation \u2014 which could take more than 60 days \u2014 had concluded.\n\n\u201cOur general principle, even as we investigate, is if we see something warrants immediate attention we don\u2019t wait for the (conclusion of) the investigation to implement,\u201d said Hart, a former chairman of the NTSB.", "description": "Investigators say a Metro train operator didn\u2019t have the necessary go-ahead from control center", "authors": ["Justin George", "Transportation Reporter Focusing On National Transit", "Metro", "The D.C.-Area Public Transportation System"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/1CXxKWVV4EFWZIIdTsrOLodg9Qs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MN2J46XJEYI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
