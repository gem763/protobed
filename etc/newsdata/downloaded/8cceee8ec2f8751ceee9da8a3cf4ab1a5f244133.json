Residency requirements to access some social benefits will also be longer and asylum seekers will no longer be eligible for childcare allowances while their asylum requests are processed.\n\nJambon said his government would upend compulsory voting in local elections.\n\nThe announcements follows 127 days of negotiations between the N-VA and its coalition partners after regional elections on May 26. The other Belgian regions, Brussels and Wallonia, already formed their governments. A new federal government, however, is still far away, after same-day elections led to a diverging outcome in right-leaning Flanders and left-leaning Wallonia.\n\nThe new measures are part of the N-VA's efforts to appease hardline elements within the party, after the far-right Vlaams Belang came close on its heel in the Flanders regional election. All three coalition partners lost votes.\n\nIn another flagship measure, Jambon said his government would upend compulsory voting in local elections, a move that is expected to harm the far right.\n\nAn increased monitoring of mosques was another element that Jambon said would address the \"feeling of discomfort\" expressed in the May elections. There will also be stricter approval requirements for new schools and Flanders will stop funding Unia, an NGO for equal opportunities and against racism that is mainly funded by the federal government. Flanders will instead set up its own human rights organization.\n\nThe future Flemish government aims to create 120,000 extra jobs over the next five years through its broader policy agenda by increasing wages and implementing retraining and activation policies. The government will allow a deficit until 2021, when the budget should be balanced again.\n\n\"We want to be a government that invests and that is of course needed to prepare Flanders for a fast-changing world,\" Jambon said.\n\nFlanders wants an 80 percent carbon emissions reduction by 2050. The region said it would double its wind and solar energy by 2030 and double investments in cycling infrastructure. Jambon further called a rollout of a 5G network over the full Flemish territory an \"absolute priority.\"\n\nEducation is another big priority for Jambon. \"Teachers need to get the status they deserve,\" he said.", "description": "Flemish nationalist Jan Jambon announced the three-party deal Monday.", "authors": ["Simon Van Dorpe"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/h_55227831-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
