Facing a Wednesday deadline, Netanyahu said he was returning the \u201cmandate\u201d to President Reuven Rivlin, who will now ask Gantz to try to form a coalition. Gantz, however, could face an equally difficult task.\n\nWhile Netanyahu remains at the helm of his Likud party, his announcement marked the second time this year that he has been unable to form a government. With Israel\u2019s attorney general set to decide in the coming weeks on whether to indict Netanyahu in a series of corruption cases, the longtime Israeli leader could come under heavy pressure to step aside. One party rival, Gideon Saar, has already indicated he would challenge Netanyahu if Likud holds a primary.\n\nIn last month\u2019s national election, Netanyahu fell short of securing a 61-seat parliamentary majority. But Rivlin gave Netanyahu the first opportunity to form a government because he had more support \u2014 55 lawmakers \u2014 than Gantz, who was supported by only 54.\n\nNetanyahu had hoped to form a broad \u201cunity\u201d government with Gantz, who heads the centrist Blue and White party. But Netanyahu insisted that his coalition include his traditional allies, a collection of hardline and religious parties, drawing accusations from Gantz that he was not negotiating in good faith.\n\n\u201cSince I received the mandate, I have worked tirelessly both in public and behind the scenes to establish a broad, national unity government. That\u2019s what the people want,\u201d Netanyahu said in a statement.\n\n\u201cDuring the past few weeks, I made every effort to bring Benny Gantz to the negotiating table. Every effort to establish a broad national unity government, every effort to prevent another election,\u201d he said. \u201cTo my regret, time after time he declined. He simply refused.\u201d\n\nFor Netanyahu, who marked his 70th birthday on Monday, it was another painful setback. In an earlier election in April, Netanyahu also failed to win a parliamentary majority and was forced to call the indecisive Sept. 17 election. Now, for the first time since Netanyahu was elected in early 2009, the country faces the possibility of choosing a different leader.\n\nIn a short statement, Gantz\u2019s Blue and White party said that \u201cnow is the time of action.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlue and White is determined to form the liberal unity government, led by Benny Gantz, that the people of Israel voted for a month ago,\u201d it said.\n\nGantz has vowed to unify the country and restore national institutions after Netanyahu\u2019s decade-long rule, which has deepened Israel\u2019s religious and political divides and been roiled by corruption allegations.\n\nIn contrast to Netanyahu, whose political career spans three decades, the 60-year-old Gantz is a newcomer who only burst onto the scene over the last year. The towering former general\u2019s party, Blue and White, is a newly formed centrist coalition that includes the popular secular politician Yair Lapid as well as other former senior military officers and some of Netanyahu\u2019s fiercest critics.\n\nAt times, Gantz has criticized Netanyahu\u2019s handling of security issues, particularly in the Gaza Strip, and has touted his time as army chief, when he oversaw a devastating 2014 war in Gaza. He also has hinted at reviving the peace process with the Palestinians. But Gantz has been vague, apparently wary of alienating potential coalition partners, and focused most of his efforts at portraying himself as a fresh alternative to Netanyahu.\n\nThere is no guarantee, however, that Gantz will succeed.\n\nHe has expressed willingness to form a partnership with Likud, but not if Netanyahu continues to lead while he faces such serious legal problems. For the time being, Likud has remained steadfastly behind its leader.\n\nWithout Likud, Gantz will have a hard time securing a majority in parliament. The opposition to Netanyahu includes a diverse group of parties, ranging from Arab parties to the secular ultranationalist party Yisrael Beitenu, that are unlikely to sit together in partnership.\n\nIf Gantz fails during his 28-day window, a majority of lawmakers could try to endorse a third candidate, something that has never happened before. And if that fails, the country would be forced into the unprecedented scenario of a third election in under a year.", "description": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Monday that he had failed to form a majority government in parliament.", "authors": ["Breitbart Jerusalem"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/10/wi/ap/07/4a0b40_israel-netanyahu-66022-israel-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-attends-e1540048453181.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
