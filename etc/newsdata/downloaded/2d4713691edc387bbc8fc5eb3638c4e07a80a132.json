Those numbers are unacceptable. We still have a lot of work to do,\u201d he said, responding to the latest report on border apprehensions.\n\nMorgan said the administration and the men and women of CBP and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement had \"incredible success\" stemming the spike back in May, when an influx of migrant families created a crisis at border detention facilities.\n\nCBP SOUNDS ALARM OVER SURGE OF HARD DRUGS, WEAPONS, GANG MEMBERS AT BORDER DESPITE RECENT GAINS\n\nMorgan said that Americans need to understand that the wall is not intended to stop law-abiding citizens or immigrants who have a merit-based claim.\n\n\u201cThis is to stop illegal immigration and, just as important, to stop the drugs from pouring into this country, killing 68,000 people last year,\u201d Morgan said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn fiscal 2019, there were a total of 1.1 million enforcement actions, a 68 percent increase from the previous year.
