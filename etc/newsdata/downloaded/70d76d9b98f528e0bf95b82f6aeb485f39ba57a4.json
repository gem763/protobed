Wow! All I can say in WOW! Never stepping another foot in Shari's. NEVER EVER!'\n\nThis ignited a firestorm among users who called out the couple for their inappropriate costumes.\n\nMariah Gladstone of Montana was able to screenshot the picture before it was removed and shared with her Twitter followers.\n\nGladstone belongs to the Blackfoot Tribe and the founder of Indigikitchen, a company dedicated to 're-indigenizing' diets and show people how to prepare meals on 'their own reservations.'\n\nGladstone took a screenshot of the now deleted Facebook post and shared it on her Twitter page with the caption: 'When the karma is swift'\n\nGladstone said: 'There\u2019s a period of time between Columbus Day and Thanksgiving where native people are expecting to see a lot of racist caricatures on social media.'\n\n'It\u2019s one of those thing that I\u2019m always bracing myself for during this season.'\n\nGladstone was initially dismayed when she saw the post, but grew optimistic when she began reading the comments.\n\nMany of the comments on the original post condemned the couple's costume and implied they were insensitive.\n\nFacebook users flocked to Shari's page to leave positive reviews praising the restaurant for their actions (pictured)\n\nIt was hopeful in that it pointed to an increased recognition to the harm that costumes based in stereotypes have,' she said.\n\nShe captioned the photo: 'When the karma is swift.'\n\nGladstone's post has more than 2,400 likes and received supportive messages.\n\nSince the incident, Shari's has garnered several positive reviews on its Facebook page.\n\nOne person promised to stop by Shari's whenever he's in Idaho because 'they refuse to allow ignorance'\n\nOne woman wrote: 'Fantastic food, fantastic staff. (with a good set of morals).'\n\n'Thank you for supporting our First Nations and not tolerating cultural appropriation,' another person wrote.\n\n'5 [star] review for the restaurant that\u2019s not afraid to stand up for what\u2019s right,' someone said.\n\n'Cultural appropriation should not ever be tolerated. Be on the right side of history like Shari\u2019s!'\n\nLewiston is less than 10 miles from the Nez Perce Indian Reservation, one of the largest in Idaho.\n\nThe Nez Perce tribe reports having more than 3,500 citizens and is a federally recognized tribal nation.\n\nThe reservation spans around 770,000 acres.\n\nThe conversation surrounding Halloween costumes and cultural appropriated has become a yearly conversation.\n\nLast years most notable iteration came off the heels of former NBC Today host Megyn Kelly.\n\nMegyn Kelly (pictured) received swift and severe backlash for her comments about blackface in 2018\n\nDuring an on-air conversation with the audience, Kelly made a case for blackface.\n\n'But what is racist?' Kelly said. 'Because you do get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on blackface on Halloween, or a black person who puts on whiteface for Halloween.'\n\n'Back when I was a kid that was OK, as long as you were dressing up as, like, a character.'\n\nKelly's comments, which enraged and offended many viewers, led her to being fired from her position at the network shortly after.\n\nViewers pointed out that the conversation did not address the hurtful history behind blackface and there were no people of color present on the panel.\n\nCelebrities like Hilary Duff (left) and Chrissy Teigen (right) received criticism for their costumes that were called cultural appropriation\n\nOther celebrities have, like Chrissy Teigen, have angered fans for their portrayals of Native Americans.\n\nTeigen wore a Native American costume in 2008 in a 'cowboys and Indians' themed joint costume.\n\nActress Hilary Duff and her former husband got heat for their 2016 costumes portraying a pilgrim and a Native American.\n\nMany advocates against cultural appropriation have noted that there is certain level of privilege present when donning a costume from another culture.\n\nThe ability to remove the identity, which is often times stoked with important cultural implications, and wear it without taking into account said implications can be hurtful.", "description": "A couple dressed as Native Americans were kicked out of a Shari's in Lewistown, Idaho, after allegedly making 'war cries' and making offensive comments to restaurant staff", "authors": ["Lauren Edmonds For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/21/20346846-0-image-a-32_1572384203711.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
