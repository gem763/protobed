But the Hammers produced an injury time wonder as Martha Thomas and Kenza Dali scored two goals in three minutes to make it 2-2. The game went down to penalties and after West Ham captain Gilly Flaherty missed the first penalty the Hammers could not get ahead, losing 4-2 despite their earlier comeback.\n\nOver in Manchester, Katie Zelem, the Reds\u2019 captain who has been a die-hard United fan her whole life, fired her free kick into the top corner to score the opening goal, before Jess Sigsworth made it 2-0 to the home side. City, who have had a stronger start to the season than United and won the last derby 1-0, were down to 10 players for the last 25 minutes after Keira Walsh was shown a red card for her tackle on Hanson.", "description": "This was a weekend of derbies in the women's Continental League Cup between the top two divisions, as Manchester turned red, East London turned dark blue and the London Bees stung the London Lionesses.", "authors": ["Sophie Penney", "Dame Sarah Storey", "Becky Downie"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/womens-sport/2019/10/20/TELEMMGLPICT000213587339-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqhNkvlguSCLNAbLFJA3hmlwHneqVwUKuplIkcPv5znvw.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
