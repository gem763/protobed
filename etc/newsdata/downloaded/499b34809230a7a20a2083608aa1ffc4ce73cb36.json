Congress has long had concerns about the regime\u2019s cooperation with U.S. adversaries, such as Russia.\n\n\"If Turkey wants to be treated like an ally, it must begin behaving like one. They must be sanctioned for their attacks on our Kurdish allies.\"\n\nMuch to the frustration of U.S. leaders, Turkey acquired a Russian S-400 air defense system in July. The deal with Russia -- the first such arrangement between Russia and a NATO member -- raised concerns that Turkey is drifting ever closer to Moscow\u2019s sphere of influence.\n\nCheney\u2019s office indicated that the legislation aligns with what President Trump has said about Turkey in the past. \u201cTurkey has been planning to attack the Kurds for a long time,\u201d Trump tweeted Thursday. \u201cI say hit Turkey very hard financially & with sanctions if they don\u2019t play by the rules!\u201d\n\nHOUSE DEMS SUBPOENA ENERGY SECRETARY RICK PERRY FOR UKRAINE DOCS IN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY\n\n\u201cPresident Erdogan\u2019s assault on our Kurdish allies is reckless and reprehensible. The Kurds sacrificed 10,000 of their own men and women combatting ISIS, and we cannot allow Turkey, a NATO partner, to attack them without repercussions,\u201d said co-sponsor Adam Kinzinger, R.-Ill.\n\nCheney\u2019s bill follows a similar one in the Senate announced Wednesday by Sens. Lindsey Graham, R.-S.C., and Chris Van Hollen, D.-Md. The Senate bill would sanction the U.S. assets of Turkish political leadership, restrict military transactions with any foreign entity (including the U.S.) and Turkey, and penalize anyone who makes transactions with Turkey\u2019s energy sector.\n\nCheney, daughter of former Vice President to George W. Bush Vice President Dick Cheney, has repeatedly sounded off about Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. forces in northeastern Syria. In one tweet, she called it a \"catastrophic mistake that puts our gains against ISIS at risk and threatens U.S. security.\"\n\nCritics have decried the decision by Trump, which they say undermines progress against ISIS in the region and leaves a U.S. ally in the fight against the Islamic State vulnerable.\n\nIn another, she called President Trump's pullback \"impossible to understand.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.", "description": "House GOP Conference Chair Liz Cheney, R.-Wyo., along with 20 Republican colleagues, said Thursday that they will be introducing legislation to impose sanctions against Turkey for their military offensive operation against U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in northern Syria.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/Liz-Cheney.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
