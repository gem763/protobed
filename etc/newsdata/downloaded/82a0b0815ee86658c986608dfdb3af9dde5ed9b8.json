He planned to testify that a call summary released by the White House is accurate: \u201cAs the transcript is in the public record, we are all aware of what was said.\u201d\n\n2 Vindman took concerns to NSC lawyer\n\nVindman planned to describe multiple scenes in which White House discussions about Ukraine policy, including discussions with Ukrainians, were interrupted by an insistence that Ukraine announce baseless investigations tied to Biden. \u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a US citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the US government\u2019s support of Ukraine,\u201d Vindman planned to say. Vindman planned to describe how on multiple occasions he took his concerns to the top lawyer for the national security counsel, as at least one other colleague did.\n\n3 Vindman\u2019s testimony appears to conflict with Sondland\u2019s claims\n\nAs multiple witnesses have previously, Vindman planned to finger ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland, as the Trump administration\u2019s point man in extracting the \u201cdeliverable\u201d \u2013 a Biden investigation announcement \u2013 from Ukraine. Vindman planned to say: \u201cI stated to Ambassador Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security.\u201d That testimony appears to conflict sharply with Sondland\u2019s own claims to ignorance about any effort to negotiate a deal with Ukraine involving a Biden investigation.\n\n4 Vindman\u2019s family fled the former Soviet Union\n\nVindman, a career public servant and soldier, arrived in the US at age three when his family fled the former Soviet Union. He is a US army officer, a lieutenant colonel, with two decades of experience in the military. He was decorated with a Purple Heart after being wounded in an improvised explosive device attack while deployed in Iraq.\n\n5 White House accused Vindman of \u2018espionage\u2019 against Trump\n\nThe White House and media allies have launched a character smear against Vindman, accusing him of disloyalty to the US and of \u201cespionage\u201d against Trump. Trump seemed surprised that Vindman was on the phone call and wondered on Twitter why so many people were listening: \u201cI knew people were listening in on the call (why would I say something inappropriate?), which was fine with me, but why so many?\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cWhy are people that I never even heard of testifying about the call.\u201d", "description": "Army lieutenant colonel to describe his concerns Trump\u2019s Biden plot was undermining US foreign policy in Ukraine", "authors": ["Tom Mccarthy", "Nathan Robinson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3020fc3836333d02d7a4c4e29e97805ebb0623c/0_208_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c51e5625fb144ffce3a1ab09a7547ddb", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
