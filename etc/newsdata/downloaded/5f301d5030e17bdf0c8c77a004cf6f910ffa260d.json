We know that Trump was directly involved because White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney admitted that it was Trump\u2019s idea in the first place. And we know that some kind of \u201cprocess\u201d took place because Mulvaney said that the administration examined 10 sites before choosing Trump Doral.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t know is who else participated in the decision. Or what agency actually made it. Or anything else about the process.", "description": "", "authors": ["Philip Rotner", "Thebulwark.Com Trumps-Doral-Scandal-An-Impeachable-Offense"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
