Lovren praised both his skipper and the fans, and noted the mentality of the team was critical in winning the points, as will be the case going forward into a busy run of games.\n\n\u201cWe knew it would be a tough game, even though they didn\u2019t have brilliant results in the last couple of games.\n\n\u201cWe knew it would be tough and unfortunately they scored in the first minute, but we kept our nerve, played our game and we had many chances.\n\n\u201cOverall, we\u2019re quite happy.

So, just be calm with our heads and everything will be OK.\u201d\n\nLiverpool face Arsenal in the League Cup on Wednesday, before further games against Aston Villa, Genk and Manchester City in the space of eight days.", "description": "Dejan Lovren says Liverpool\u00a0are learning lessons from previous campaigns where they have gone close to winning the Premier League, but insists the club must take it one game at a time.
