At this site, a thick layer of rock from the time of the impact \u2014 the so-called boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene periods \u2014 is preserved as a green clay-rich layer\n\n'In this cave, an especially thick layer of clay from the immediate aftermath of the impact accumulated, which is really quite rare,' said Dr Henehan\n\nWith this initial study complete, the researchers are taking advantage of the facilities in the German Research Centre for Geosciences to enhance their methodology.\n\n'With the femtosecond laser in the HELGES laboratory, we are working to be able to measure these kind of signals from much smaller amounts of sample,' says ???Henehan.\n\n'This will in the future enable us to obtain all sorts of information at really high resolution in time, even from locations with very low sedimentation rates.'\n\nThe full findings of the study were published in the journal PNAS.", "description": "Experts led from the German Research Centre for Geosciences reconstructed ocean conditions using tiny fossils called foraminifera and rocks from\u00a0the time of the impact.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/12/20032872-0-image-a-82_1571744684249.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
