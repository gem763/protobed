Gen. Edward Thomas said in a statement Sunday that the trip fell within \u201cguidelines associated with selecting stopover airports on travel routes and hotel accommodations,\u201d but said Air Force is now reviewing all guidance on the selection of airport and lodging accommodations during international trips.\n\n\u201cU.S. Service members lodging at resort accommodations, even if within government rates, might be allowable but not advisable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not only stewards of American tax dollars but we represent our nation as we travel abroad.\u201d\n\nA crew of seven Air Force and Alaska Air National Guard members stayed at the Trump Turnberry golf resort en route to Kuwait for $136 a night, Brig. Gen. Thomas said. The hotel was dozens of miles away from Glasgow Prestwick Airport but was the closest available and cheapest option within the $166-per-day maximum allowable hotel rates, he added.\n\n\u201cAs our aircrews serve on these international airlift missions, they follow strict guidelines on contracting for hotel accommodations,\u201d he said.\n\nU.S. military expenditures at Prestwick and the nearby Turnberry golf resort operated by the Trump organization are at the center of a continuing probe by House Democrats.\n\nIn a June letter, House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings requested information from the Pentagon about the expenses, citing legal questions about whether the president\u2019s golf course was being improperly subsidized by the military expenditures.\n\nThe letter, sent to then-acting Department of Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, also cites a February 2018 article in the Guardian newspaper, which reported that the Prestwick airport offered U.S. crews free rounds of golf at Trump Turnberry.\n\nA representative for the Prestwick didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\n\u201cGiven the President\u2019s continued financial stake in his Scotland golf courses, these reports raise questions about the President\u2019s potential receipt of U.S. or foreign government emoluments in violation of the U.S. Constitution and raise other serious conflict of interest concerns,\u201d Mr. Cummings wrote in the June letter, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nDetails about the Democratic inquiry were reported earlier by Politico. Representatives from the White House and the Trump Organization didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment Sunday.\n\nThe Defense Department hasn\u2019t produced any documents in the investigation, a committee aide said Sunday, suggesting the committee would consider issuing subpoenas if the Pentagon doesn\u2019t comply voluntarily in the coming days.\n\nThe C-17 plane and its crew were on a multi-leg journey that took them from Anchorage, Alaska, to Creech Air Force Base in Nevada, to Portsmouth, N.H., Glasgow and Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait and then back.\n\nPrestwick is favored by the U.S. Air Force because it is open 24 hours, has better weather than an airport in Shannon, Ireland, also routinely used by the military and less congestion than other European locations, Brig. Gen. Thomas said.\n\nThe U.S. government signed a multimillion-dollar refueling contract with the Prestwick airport in August 2016, according to public procurement records. Since October 2017, the U.S. military has paid the airport hundreds of times for fuel purchases totaling $11 million, Mr. Cummings said. The U.S. government has also made tens of thousands of dollars in purchases at the Turnberry resort in 2018 and 2019, according to procurement records.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump stepped down as a director of the Turnberry resort company in 2017, his two sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. have stayed on as the company\u2019s directors, according to corporate records. And the president continues to have financial interests in the resort, according to his financial disclosures.\n\nMr. Trump in 2014 announced a partnership between the Turnberry resort and Prestwick airport, according to local news reports at the time, encouraging the golf course\u2019s customers to fly through Prestwick. \u201c Donald Trump pledges to make Prestwick Airport \u2018really successful,\u2019\u201d he tweeted.\n\nBoth the Scottish government-owned airport and the Turnberry resort have lost money in recent years, Mr. Cummings said in his letter.\n\nWrite to Lalita Clozel at lalita.clozel@wsj.com and Joshua Jamerson at joshua.jamerson@wsj.com", "description": "The U.S. Air Force said the service was reviewing its travel-spending policies after an aircrew\u2019s March stay at a Trump golf resort in Scotland intensified scrutiny over public funds being spent in hotels and resorts tied to the president.", "authors": ["Lalita Clozel", "Joshua Jamerson", "Lalita.Clozel Wsj.Com", "Joshua.Jamerson Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105122/social", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
