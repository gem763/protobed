Fruman\u2019s lawyer, Todd Blanche, a partner with Cadwalader in New York, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nParnas and Fruman had been trying to make inroads into the state cannabis business for at least two years, after voters there legalized medical use of the drug in November 2016. The Miami Herald earlier reported on their attempts.\n\nTwo people with ties to the cannabis industry told POLITICO they met with Parnas and Fruman approximately five times over the past two years and spoke multiple more times on the phone about going into business together.\n\nAbout a year ago, Parnas and Fruman agreed to invest between $25 million and $30 million in a proposed Florida cannabis company, according to the two industry executives. It was apparent that Parnas and Fruman weren\u2019t very savvy about cannabis, they said, but that isn\u2019t unusual in the pot industry.\n\nWhat did raise red flags was their inability to produce a lawyer, their cluelessness about regulations in states they claimed to be licensed in, and their constant excuses that, the executives said, seemed shadier as time went on.\n\nAccording to the executives, Parnas and Fruman claimed to have licenses in California and Nevada, yet they didn\u2019t know the regulatory basics in either state. They declined to show proof of funds, saying they didn\u2019t want to give away trade secrets.\n\nAbout six months ago, Parnas and Fruman announced they had a regulatory hurdle: One of their primary financial backers already had a more than 5 percent stake in another Florida cannabis company, which meant they could not invest in a similar business.\n\n\u201cWhen they came back with the regulatory issue, we were like, \u2018They should have noticed this way before,\u2019\u201d one of the cannabis executives told POLITICO.\n\nEven when a Florida court seemed to remove the regulatory conflict, Parnas and Fruman still didn\u2019t produce an attorney or move forward. The pair claimed to be represented by a lawyer with Greenspoon Marder in Phoenix.\n\n\u201cThat was one of our things that we thought was kind of shady,\u201d said the executive. \u201cThey still never put us in touch with their counsel, with the Greenspoon Marder guy, to have this conversation. So that doesn\u2019t make sense; they had all this money, and then they didn\u2019t. And this court decision now says they can, but they still aren\u2019t producing anything. There\u2019s weird shit going on.\u201d\n\nEventually, the two executives said they did speak briefly with Greenspoon Marder lawyer Stephen Lenn.\n\nA Greenspoon Marder receptionist in Phoenix said Lenn was no longer with the firm. Lenn did not immediately respond to a request for comment made through a LinkedIn profile. Calls to numbers associated with his name went unanswered or were no longer in service.\n\nParnas and Fruman tried to enter the business again in May, after Florida entered into a court settlement to issue eight new medical marijuana licenses. It was the first time licenses had come up for sale since Florida voters had legalized the drug.\n\nA consultant hired to sell some of the newly issued licenses said Parnas and Fruman, both naturalized U.S. citizens, couldn\u2019t convince him or his clients that they were prepared to assume the responsibility of a medical cannabis business.\n\nThe Florida-based consultant, who spoke on condition of anonymity to uphold his client\u2019s confidentiality, said Parnas and Fruman didn\u2019t understand the industry\u2019s complexity.\n\n\"You've got to be thinking about things like infrastructure and hiring people with know-how,\" the broker said. \"They didn't seem ready, and when you're getting into one of these deals, you're doing it to close.\"\n\nA Florida cannabis industry lawyer said he also encountered Parnas and Fruman in May, when they inquired about two licenses. The men couldn\u2019t show they had the money to pay for two of the licenses.\n\nThe going rate for a cannabis license in Florida is more than $50 million. In August, Columbus, Ohio-based Green Growth Brands paid $54.6 million for a Florida license it purchased from Spring Oaks Greenhouses Inc., according to a prospectus.\n\n\"They couldn't prove they had the cash,\" said the lawyer, who also asked not to be identified, citing client-attorney privilege. \"They weren't serious.\"\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican and Trump ally, has come under fire for his connections to Parnas and Fruman. Parnas hopscotched the state with DeSantis on a campaign trip just before last year\u2019s election. And the governor\u2019s campaign received $50,000 from Global Energy Producers LLC, a shell company at the heart of the federal indictment against Parnas and Fruman.\n\nDeSantis said he would transfer that donation to the U.S. Treasury.\n\nA cannabis industry lobbyist said the governor was not directly involved in the administrative court settlement that led to eight licenses being issued in April. Another lobbyist in Tallahassee said Parnas and Fruman were treated the same as hundreds of other people who have inquired about purchasing one of the licenses.\n\nThe Tallahassee lobbyist said none of the talks elevated to the state Department of Health, which has to approve any new licensee.\n\nIn typical ownership transfers, the department accepts an application from the new business, which involves a fee of more than $60,000 and a background check on the buyers.\n\n\"That background check would have stopped them right there,\" the consultant said.", "description": "\"There\u2019s weird shit going on.\"", "authors": ["Arek Sarkissian", "Natalie Fertig"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e3/23/a33a02fd4d4a9d9de44dceffa117/1007marijuana.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
