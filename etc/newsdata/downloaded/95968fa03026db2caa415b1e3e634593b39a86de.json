We are not oblivious of the fact that official images depicting the Volkswagen Golf 8 have \u201cleaked\u201d onto the Internet in the last few hours, but there\u2019s a thing called mutual respect and keeping your end of the agreement. In just a few hours, all will be revealed following what will be a nearly two-hour event held right in the heart of VW \u2013 the Autostadt facility located near the factory in Wolfsburg.\n\nFew other cars have the global impact the Golf enjoys, especially if we take into account it\u2019s available basically all over the world and has racked up more than 35 million sales since its launch in 1974. The eighth generation aims to be the most technologically advanced model yet, which might not say much seeing as how that\u2019s the norm in the automotive industry, but there are going to be some major changes.\n\nCourtesy of spy shots and a handful of teasers, we know the VW Touareg\u2019s high-tech Innovision Cockpit will be adapted for the Golf 8. This is going to radically change the look of the dashboard by getting rid of many conventional controls as these will be incorporated into the central display. We can probably say goodbye to the physical dials and needles of the instrument cluster since we\u2019re expecting even the base model to have an all-digital setup.\n\nThe updated MQB platform will come along with an array of more economical engines benefiting from a mild hybrid system in the case of the petrol units carrying the \u201ceTSI\u201d moniker. There will also be a cleaner diesel and a couple of plug-in hybrid versions to further broaden the Golf\u2019s customer base. Of course, performance versions will follow, with VW already announcing the GTI and R are both due to be unveiled in 2020.\n\nGolf 8 in the news:\n\nOnly the hatchback is going to be introduced today, and only in five-door form as VW reconfirmed earlier this week plans to axe the three-door model due to low demand. It\u2019s unclear when the estate will be introduced, but chances are it\u2019ll debut just in time for the 2020 Geneva Motor Show next March.\n\nThe livestream will start at 5:30 PM GMT+1 / 6:30 PM CEST / 12:30 PM EST.\n\n\n\n", "description": "The livestream will start at 5:30 PM GMT+1 / 6:30 PM CEST / 12:30 PM EST.", "authors": ["Feedback", "Adrian Padeanu"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/57gM9T3BWNNvQEtRV42BOQ--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/motor1_uk_340/3adb3cfd22833e81f1b73562eb0c1185", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
