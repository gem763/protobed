Mounting costs have fueled the national conversation, and health care is shaping up to be a key issue in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nSee Also: 10 Myths About Health Savings Accounts\n\nEven with employer-provided insurance, your expenses--including premiums and out-of-pocket costs--will likely go up this year. But selecting the right plan for you and your family can help save money. For example, if you don't anticipate having hefty medical expenses, you may come out ahead with a high-deductible health insurance plan paired with a health savings account. For Andy Hill, a corporate event sales director who lives in a suburb of Detroit with his wife, Nicole, and their two children, Zoey and Calvin, switching to a high-deductible plan has saved the family $200 to $300 a month in premiums and allowed them to save about $10,000 in their HSA for future medical expenses.\n\nRegardless of which health insurance plan you choose or whether you get coverage from your employer, through Medicare or on your own, some key strategies for smart shopping can save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars a year on out-of-pocket health care expenses.\n\nUnderstand your coverage. Most plans are still required to provide several kinds of preventive care without any cost-sharing, regardless of your deductible. However, short-term health plans, which typically come with lower premiums than Affordable Care Act policies, aren't required to provide ACA-mandated benefits, such as no-cost preventive care. Depending on your age, this might apply to blood-pressure, diabetes and cholesterol tests; mammograms and colonoscopies; and flu shots and routine vaccines.

Many employers offer savings and incentive programs that reward you for using high-quality, cost-effective providers. Such programs may reduce your out-of-pocket expenses or waive your deductible for that visit or procedure.\n\nPick the right provider. Before you schedule a doctor's visit or a medical procedure, use the tools on your insurer's website, and ask the provider to confirm that they're included in your plan's network. If you're scheduling a procedure, check whether everyone involved--from the doctor to the facility to the anesthesiologist--will be covered in-network. If you're unlikely to hit your plan's deductible for the year, or you're going to a doctor who is out of network, see if you can get a discount for paying cash. You may pay less out of pocket than if you use insurance, and you may still be able to file a claim with your insurer afterward so that the cost can count toward your deductible, says Bill Kampine, senior vice president of HealthcareBluebook.com.\n\nPrices for medical tests and procedures can vary widely, even within the same city. And your doctor may practice at several hospitals or outpatient facilities. To see how costs for a specific procedure in your area vary, visit HealthcareBluebook.com. Most insurers also have tools to help you compare costs at in-network facilities.\n\nBefore scheduling a test or medical procedure, ask your doctor how much it will cost and where he or she will perform it. If the total charge is higher than the fair price, ask about less-expensive alternative facilities that will provide the same quality of care. The surgical fee will be the same, but the facility's charge can vary by thousands of dollars.\n\nWhere you go for lab work matters, too. Check to see if your health plan has a preferred lab with lower costs. Most doctors work with multiple lab companies, but you need to request that your blood or other test materials be sent to your insurer's preferred lab.\n\nSee Also: What You Should Know About Open Enrollment\n\nResearch in advance nearby hospitals and urgent care centers that are in your plan's network, and check to see whether there are any special requirements for emergency care. For minor burns, cuts and sprains, flu symptoms, and minor infections, you'll probably save by avoiding the emergency room and going to an urgent care facility or convenience care clinic.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Choosing the right insurance policy is key to managing higher deductibles and co-pays.", "authors": ["Kaitlin Pitsker", "Associate Editor", "Kiplinger'S Personal Finance"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/F3uqdB7TTgwrTnviS4VDxA--~B/aD04MDA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/kiplinger.com/698fe43ad09c912bd420f60b8bad846d", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
