In Tamil Nadu alone, more than ten children have faced a similar fate over the past fifteen years.\n\nA man places flowers on the coffin of a toddler who died after getting stuck in a borewell, in Trichy/REUTERS PHOTO\n\nThese incidents paint a completely contradictory image of the India that is aiming to fast climb the ladders of development, is arguably one of the fastest growing economies and that is sending extravagant missions into the space or building super-modern bullet trains for that matter.\n\nScientific progress has a purpose and leading cosmologists such as late Stephen Hawking had asserted that all human endeavours in the field of science and technology would be rendered worthless if they couldn\u2019t be directed towards the betterment of the human race. India, on the other hand, has undoubtedly made much progress over the years and our space missions have drawn the attention of the entire world. And for all the right reasons.\n\nDon't Miss 493 SHARES 677 SHARES 23.5 K SHARES 18.9 K SHARES\n\nBut when you look down, there are holes -- some abandoned, some functional and the rest out of sight that go right into the heart of the earth and are so ghastly difficult to reach that once somebody falls into it, the rescue operations go on for days in a row and, more often than not, we end up losing precious lives into these trenches.\n\nPrivate tanker is being filled water from a borewell on Poonamallee Bypass Road near Senneerkuppam in Chennai. BCCL\n\nFurther, Sujith\u2019s death has brought to the fore the lack of awareness on sealing unused borewells and public apathy towards taking safety measures. Inexplicably, April 2014 had seen repeated incidents of innocent children becoming victims of uncovered borewells in the state.\n\nIn September 2013, a six-year old girl child had died after falling into a borewell in Pulavanpadi village in Tiruvannamalai District. Then, another three-year-old girl, R Madhumita, got stuck at about 30 feet of a 500-feet borewell at her father's farm at Pallagaseri village near Villupuram in April 2014. She had fallen into the borewell - covered with a polythene sack - when she stepped on it accidentally while playing.\n\nAfter a 19-hour long struggle, she was rescued alive by multiple teams working in tandem,but later died in a hospital.\n\nAn agriculture borewell in Chinnayanakanahalli village in Srirangapatna taluk is overflowing without running motor pump and people are thronging the place to get glimpse of this astounding sight. BCCL\n\nDays after this mishap, a four-year-old boy Harshan fell into a borewell, also located in a farm at Kuthalapuri in Tirunelveli district. Rescuers had battled for more than five hours and brought the child out alive. A day after the successful rescue,an 18-month old toddler fell into an unused borewell at Kidampalayam village, about 50 km from Tiruvannamalai. D Sujith was playing near a farm along with some family members when he fell into it. Stuck at about 47 feet in the 200 feet borewell, his body was taken out after 24-hours of rescue efforts.\n\nBut Tamil Nadu is not alone, there has been a spike in incidents relating to the borewell in the recent past in almost all parts of the country. A two-year-old boy was pulled out of a 150-foot-deep abandoned borewell in Punjab's Sangrur district in June this year. There have been similar reports in other parts of the country too.\n\nA 108-employee hold on to oxygen and water pipes towards the end of the rescue operation to save 15-month-old Chinnari who fell into an open borewell at Ekkareddiguda,Chevella/BCCL\n\nIt is a good thing that India\u2019s scientific developments are earning it global reputation, and in fact it has been a historical tradition in the country that is home to some of the finest doctors, engineers, scientists and economists in the world. But with the development of scientific technology, we should also be able to save precious lives that are lost due to things of our own making.", "description": "These incidents paint a completely contradictory image of the India that is aiming to fast climb the ladders of development, is arguably one of the fastest growing economies and that is sending extravagant missions into the space or building super-modern bullet trains for that matter.", "authors": ["Saket Suman"], "top_image": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2019/Oct/borewell_1572417669_800x420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
