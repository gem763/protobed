I'm coming back.\"\n\nSome suggested the likes of Atletico Madrid may be among the favourites for his signature, with Ladbrokes placing Diego Simeone's side at 5/2 to move for the 38-year-old.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nHowever, according to Spanish outlet AS the video may have been a publicity stunt for a betting firm that employ him as a brand ambassador.\n\nAccording to AS Ibrahimovic has recently partnered up with Bethard, and that may be the group behind the cryptic message.\n\nIbrahimovic's time at Barcelona was a mixed one following his signing from Inter Milan. Although he scored 21 goals in 45 appearances, he reportedly fell out with then-Barca manager Pep Guardiola, allegedly telling the Catalan boss \"You bought a Ferrari, but you drive it like a Fiat.\"\n\nIbrahimovic is out of contract with LA Galaxy in December, and has most likely played his last game for the club.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nFollowing his side's 5-3 loss to LAFC in the Western Conference playoff semi-final he said in typically brash fashion: \"What happens next year? I don't know. If I stay it will be good for MLS because the whole world will watch it. If I don't stay, nobody will remember what MLS is.\"\n\nAs well as a return to Spain Ibrahimovic has also been linked with a possible move to Napoli, while David Beckham's upcoming franchise Inter Miami have also been mooted as a potential next destination for the controversial player.", "description": "Details have emerged after a video was released in which the Swedish forward insisted he was 'coming back' to the country where he spent one season", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Getty Images", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20656450.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Statue-of-Zlatan-Ibrahimovic-is-unveiled-in-his-hometown-of-Malmo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
