Those included in the SDN can argue that they were victims of mistaken identity, or that the reason for sanctions being imposed no longer exists \u2013 but there is no provision in US regulations to argue innocence. Instead petitioners for delisting are encouraged to prove \"a positive change in behaviour\".\n\nThere are various routes to getting on the SDN. The Guptas have been designated under America's 2016 Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, activated by an executive order that declared \"serious human rights abuses and corruption globally\" as an emergency threat to US interests.\n\nOver the the past two years the so-called GloMag list has grown rapidly to include people believed to be responsible for horrific crimes in various parts of the world, from arms dealers to thieves who steal foreign-donor funds intended for the most desperately poor people in their home countries.\n\nThis is the company the Gupta brothers and Salim Essa find themselves in as part of the GloMag list.\n\nIndividuals and groups implicated in ethnic cleansing in Myanmar.\n\nIn August 2018 leaders and units of Myanmar's army for what the US described as \"their involvement in ethnic cleansing in Burma\u2019s Rakhine State and other widespread human rights abuses in Burma\u2019s Kachin and Shan States\".\n\nThe likes of Lieutenant General Aung Kyaw Zaw are believed to have been directly involved in a campaign of ethnic cleansing that featured massacres and sexual assaults, and caused 700,000 Muslims to flee the country.\n\nAlleged torturers and henchmen from The Gambia and Cambodia.\n\nGloMag features Yahya Jammeh, President of The Gambia until 2017, and alleged helpers such as Yankuba Badgie, who supposedly directly led paramilitary group \"the Junglers\", a greatly-feared \"terror and assassination squad\" that operated in that country.\n\nAn inquiry into the Junglers has heard how victims were cut into pieces or thrown into wells after being shot or suffocated with plastic bags.\n\nThe list features alleged henchman from other countries too, such as General Hing Bun Hieng, who commanded Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen\u2019s bodyguards. Those bodyguards were allegedly involved in beating opposition supporters \u2013 and in one case helping in the escape of people who lobbed hand grenades into an opposition crowd.\n\nThe Saudi Arabian team believed responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nIn November a group believed to have murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi were added to the GloMag list.\n\nEvidence suggests the team drugged Khashoggi before dismembering him, on what several countries say were the orders of Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The GloMag list, which now feature the Gupta brothers and associate Salim Essa, is a collection of allegedly terrible people, including arms dealers, abusers, and people who steal from people in desperate need.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7986/a6d4be3af26d4737982be8243c11aab4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
