But it\u2019s possible that other, stealthier drones complement the high-flying but non-stealthy Global Hawks.\n\nIn 2010, the U.S. Air Force surveyed an airbase in the United Arab Emirates for the deployment of RQ-170 Sentinel stealth spy drones.\n\nAccording to heavily-redacted official documents that journalist Joe Trevithick obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, on Sept. 14, 2010, the Air Force\u2019s Air Combat Command circulated an internal memo discussing the \u201cpre-deployment site survey\u201d for placing some of the satellite-controlled RQ-170s at Al Dhafra airbase in the Emirates.\n\nIn 2019 Al Dhafra hosts American F-22s, F-35s, F-15Es and other warplanes. The MQ-4C drone that Iran shot down in June 2019 also flew from Al Dhafra.\n\nThe small force of flying-wing RQ-170s was busy even before the possible UAE deployment. The 30th Reconnaissance Squadron \u2014 a combined Air Force and CIA unit normally based in remote Tonopah, Nevada -- apparently operates all of the roughly 30 RQ-170s that Lockheed Martin built for the Air Force in the early 2000s.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "So much spying.", "authors": ["David Axe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XUWooj0cDC8DAznUGbvIXA--~B/aD05NjE7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/ee4d37fa17255a7e057b45d63a8b3ca1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
