These strategic initiatives will help in building a more resilient portfolio and delivering sustainable growth to unitholders.\u201d\n\nIndeed, hi-tech buildings was the largest contributor, making up 40 per cent of MIT\u2019s gross revenue and net property income in the first half of the fiscal year.\n\nThis was followed by flatted factories at 38 per cent.\n\nThe manager announced an advanced distribution of 2.93 cents per unit for the period from July 1, 2019 to Sept 25, 2019 to be paid to unitholders on Oct 21, 2019, while the balance DPU of 0.2 cent will be payable together with the third quarter distribution.\n\nUnits of the Reit closed five cents or 1.9 per cent lower at S$2.53.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Companies & Markets - New revenue contributions from recently acquired, refurbished or completed properties led Mapletree Industrial Trust (MIT) to post a higher distribution per unit (DPU) of 3.13 Singapore cents for its second quarter, up from the 3.01 Singapore cents it paid out a year ago. .
