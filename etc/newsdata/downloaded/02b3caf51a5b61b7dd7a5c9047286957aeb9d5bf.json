The only problem? There\u2019s not enough money left to pay employee severance packages.\n\nWeWork literally can\u2019t afford to let people go. Meanwhile, founder Adam Neumann is set to walk away with a $200 million payday under a rescue package by Softbank.\n\nSoftbank, one of the lead investors in WeWork, is expected to announce a $5 billion rescue deal today. The package includes $200 million for Neumann to give up his voting shares.\n\nThe rise and fall of WeWork\n\nAs SoftBank steps in to bail out WeWork, the company\u2019s valuation has plunged. Just weeks ago, the unicorn startup was valued at $47 billion. Now it\u2019s $7.5 billion.\n\nThe company was readying an IPO with JP Morgan leading the charge. Employees with stock options watched the company\u2019s valuation soar to dizzy heights. Weeks later, they face the guillotine with no money left for a severance package.\n\nAs Bloomberg editor and anchor Joe Weisenthal wrote:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy to think of the number of WeWork employees who, a few months ago, thought they were on the verge of becoming millionaires. Fortuna\u2019s wheel turns again.\u201d\n\nA leaked memo from WeWork\u2019s co-CEOs confirmed that layoffs are on the horizon.\n\n\u201cAs part of refocusing around our core business, we are strategically reorganizing our operating model with the goal of creating a leaner, more efficient organization. As we have mentioned, this will result in a smaller, global workforce \u2026 While we cannot commit to an exact timeline, we expect this exercise to roll out largely by function and over the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nAdam Neumann to walk away with $200 million\n\nWhile employees are left in limbo, eccentric co-founder Adam Neumann is expected to walk away with $200 million.\n\nNeumann resigned in recent weeks but still controls 20% through shares and voting rights. The SoftBank rescue package aims to wrestle voting rights back from Neumann in exchange for a $200 million handshake.\n\n\u201cAs co-founder of WeWork, I am so proud of this team and the incredible company that we have built over the last decade\u2026 While our business has never been stronger, in recent weeks, the scrutiny directed toward me has become a significant distraction, and I have decided that it is in the best interest of the company to step down as chief executive\u201d \u2013 Neumann\u2019s resignation speech.\n\nNeumann\u2019s hubris has arguably led to WeWork\u2019s downfall. He mismanaged company finances, including renting his own real estate to the company and using his own stock as collateral in personal loans.\n\nNow those mistakes are hitting the company, investors, and employees hard while Neumann walks away with $200 million in his pocket.", "description": "SoftBank is set to rescue WeWork with a $5 billion package, including a $200 million payout for ex-CEO Adam Neumann while employees face axe.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Adam-Neumann-Flickr.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
