Sign up here.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China is threatening to draw one of the global economy\u2019s neutral referees into the fray: the International Monetary Fund.\n\nAs part of his campaign to pressure Beijing into changing its trade practices, Trump last month formally declared China a currency manipulator. But in a move that risks undermining the IMF\u2019s place as an arbiter for sound economic policy, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has also been quietly pushing the fund to endorse its view -- just weeks after the IMF found China\u2019s yuan was fairly valued and declared there was no evidence of manipulation by Beijing, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe decision by the U.S., the IMF\u2019s largest shareholder, is putting new pressure on the institution as it undergoes a sensitive leadership transition following Christine Lagarde\u2019s departure for the European Central Bank. It also adds another point of tension to Trump\u2019s more than year-long assault on the global trading system.\n\n1980s Law\n\nIMF officials have quietly rebuffed Treasury attempts to draw it into the fight as they try to avoid getting caught in the economic battle between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\n\nThe fund considers China\u2019s yuan as fairly valued, does not find evidence of manipulation, and sees no need to revisit the country\u2019s currency practices, according to public comments by officials and people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity. The lender is not planning to change that view at the behest of the Trump administration, the people said.\n\nMnuchin\u2019s formal designation that Beijing manipulates its currency was justified using a 1980s trade law with looser standards for the label, ignoring a 2015 law with a more detailed criteria.\n\nThe standoff is likely to be high on the agenda for Kristalina Georgieva, who is widely expected to formally succeed Lagarde as the IMF\u2019s managing director within weeks.\n\nIn Treasury\u2019s Aug. 5 statement designating China a manipulator, it said it would engage with the IMF to eliminate \u201cunfair\u201d currency practices. Two days later, Mnuchin spoke to IMF acting managing director David Lipton to plan consultations on China\u2019s currency, along with other issues, according to a Treasury spokesman.\n\nThe IMF decided against any public comment in response to that statement and instead use a scheduled briefing on it\u2019s annual Article IV report on China\u2019s economic health to send its own message, according to one person familiar with the matter.\n\nA Treasury spokesman said that meeting with the IMF regarding certain countries is common, declining to comment further. An IMF spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nThe IMF has so far not started any formal process to work with Treasury to address China\u2019s currency regime, and instead plans to offer subtle push-back on the U.S.\u2019s manipulation charge, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nMnuchin, however, sees otherwise.\n\n\u201cThere will be bilateral discussions and discussions between the IMF and China,\u201d the Treasury chief told Bloomberg News in an Aug. 28 interview. Mnuchin said he spoke to People\u2019s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang shortly after his designation on the yuan.\n\nMnuchin labeled China a currency manipulator -- a move seen as largely symbolic -- the day after the yuan broke the 7 per dollar level for the first time since 2008, unleashing tumult across global markets. Mnuchin\u2019s announcement followed a declaration by China\u2019s central bank that the nation wouldn\u2019t use the yuan as a tool to deal with trade disputes, a statement that Mnuchin viewed as an acknowledgment of intervention, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThere is evidence of the IMF\u2019s indirect rejection of Trump\u2019s views of the yuan, which gained little traction.\n\n\u201cWe see in 2018 as broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies\u201d and \u201cnot significantly over or undervalued,\u201d James Daniel, an assistant director in the IMF\u2019s Asia Pacific office, said in an Aug. 13 call with reporters. \u201cWe will conduct further analysis in 2020, as part of standard IMF processes.\u201d\n\nThe IMF reiterated that message last week in China: The yuan \u201cis assessed to be in line with fundamentals,\u201d Longmei Zhang, deputy resident representative for the IMF in China, told reporters, the South China Morning Post reported.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s relationship with the IMF may start to improve soon. Mnuchin backs Georgieva, the World Bank\u2019s chief executive, to replace Lagarde as the IMF\u2019s managing director, and the Treasury secretary has a good working relationship with her, according to people familiar with the matter. European governments last month selected her as their nominee.\n\nGeorgieva could be installed at the IMF as soon as early October, at which point Mnuchin could renew efforts to engage the lender in addressing Beijing\u2019s currency policy.\n\nOne option could be requesting a \u201cspecial mission\u201d where the IMF would examine China\u2019s currency regime, according to one person. The move would be unprecedented and would likely be blocked by the Chinese, they said.\n\nSuch a report may also find that Trump\u2019s tariffs caused the recent large swings in the yuan. Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer have said previously that there will be a currency \u201cchapter\u201d in any trade deal struck with China, through they\u2019ve given few specifics on what would be in it.\n\nExchange-Rate Flexibility\n\nThe IMF\u2019s disagreement\u2019s with Treasury began before the administration labeled China a currency manipulator.\n\nIn July -- before the yuan slumped to a decade low -- Treasury urged the IMF to use its annual report on China\u2019s economic health to encourage it to stem the yuan\u2019s depreciation, according to people familiar with discussions. While such disagreements aren\u2019t unusual, the Treasury Department sent nearly a dozen officials to the IMF in July to express dissatisfaction with the upcoming report, which was released on Aug. 9.\n\nThe officials told the IMF that its key message on currencies should not be in support of exchange-rate flexibility, and that if it must address foreign-exchange, the fund should encourage a policy that strengthens the yuan, the people said. That\u2019s because a weaker renminbi would counter the effects of Trump\u2019s trade tariffs, they said.\n\nBut their argument failed to work, and the IMF did not make any changes to its conclusions, they said. Such meetings between the U.S. and the IMF about a particular country are routine.\n\nMnuchin had refrained from formally labeling China a currency manipulator in Treasury\u2019s semi-annual report on foreign-exchange policies based on the 2015 criteria, even amid tense trade talks. The next report to Congress on currency policies is expected in October.\n\n(Updates with additional context from 22nd paragraph)", "description": "Trump\u2019s Trade War Pits Mnuchin Against IMF Over China\u2019s Yuan", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic6ca01daa4efd9ab3e119d49e0b0dee99.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
