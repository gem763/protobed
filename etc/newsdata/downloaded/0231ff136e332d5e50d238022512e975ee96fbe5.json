But derivatives of the sulfuric-acid-based salts, like sodium lauryl sulfate, can still be found in many popular shampoos. That\u2019s because, despite what has been said about how they can harm our bodies, sulfates are highly effective at cleaning your hair and scalp, and they give shampoo that lather that\u2019s synonymous with a thorough cleanse. But according to Brooke Jordan, co-owner and master stylist at the Bird House salon in Gowanus, sulfates\u2019 ability to clean is just not worth their potential negative side effects. \u201cThe scoop on sulfates,\u201d she explains, \u201cis that they\u2019re detergents in the surfactant family, and although there are types of surfactants that are completely safe for us, sulfates in particular are generally known to be unsafe.\u201d And as Shirley Hagel, an advanced master stylist at Parlor salon, points out, \u201cSodium lauryl sulfate, which is the harshest of the sulfates, is the same ingredient used in Dawn dish soap.\u201d\n\nSo if you wouldn\u2019t wash your hair with Dawn, it\u2019s probably best to find a shampoo without SLS or any other kinds of sulfates. Luckily, there are tons of sulfate-free shampoos on the market, ranging from bottles you can find at your local CVS to luxe salon-grade brands. What\u2019s more, sulfate-free shampoos are out there for all hair types, too. To find out which sulfate-free shampoos work best for different hair types, we spoke to six hairstylists and salon owners. Read on for their picks, which include shampoos for specific hair types, others that can be used universally, and even some that will deliver the lather of their sulfate-filled cousins (just without the harmful ingredients).\n\nBest overall sulfate-free shampoo\n\nVerb Ghost Shampoo $16 (was $20, now 20% off) Stephanie Louis, the owner of Brooklyn\u2019s Stylebox Salon, emphatically recommends Verb Ghost as a universal sulfate-free shampoo that \u201cworks for EVERYBODY.\u201d She adds that \u201cit\u2019s probably the best shampoo we\u2019ve ever worked with; no matter the hair texture or type, it detangles with ease, moisturizes immediately, and doesn\u2019t leave hair feeling heavy with product.\u201d Louis told us this versatile shampoo won\u2019t bleed out color if you\u2019re using it on color-treated hair. She\u2019s not the only one who loves it \u2014 the inexpensive Verb Ghost is among the best-rated shampoos at Sephora, according to some 307 hyperenthusiastic reviewers, one of whom wrote that \u201cit feels almost magical when it lathers.\u201d This is a not-insignificant detail because, as we noted above, sulfates are often what makes shampoos foam up, so it can be harder to find a sulfate-free one with lathering properties, let alone \u201calmost magical\u201d ones. (Another Sephora reviewer raved that Verb Ghost \u201cbasically gave me shampoo-commercial hair.\u201d) Louis\u2019s emphatic endorsement of Verb as a sulfate-free shampoo safe for any hair type, coupled with the Sephora reviewers\u2019 praise for it (and its affordable price tag), helped it rise to the top of the list. \u201cIt\u2019s really amazing, top-shelf stuff,\u201d Louis promises. $16 at Amazon Buy $16 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest drugstore sulfate-free shampoo\n\nSheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Shampoo Louis says this sulfate-free shampoo carried by most drugstores is the one to grab if you\u2019re doing a quick CVS or Duane Reade run. She notes that \u201ceven though it says for \u2018extremely dry, brittle hair,\u2019 it really is for any hair type.\u201d Plus, she says, the Shea Moisture shampoo can double as a conditioner in a pinch: \u201cIt\u2019s really good at leaving the hair super-moisturized even without conditioner.\u201d If you\u2019re looking for something that delivers even more hydration, you could try Shea Moisture\u2019s sulfate-free Protein Strong Treatment, which Strategist contributor Shammara Lawrence says her dry curls \u201cdrink up.\u201d (Lawrence also told us she notices that she sheds less hair after using it.) $16 at Amazon Buy $10 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nBest sulfate-free shampoo for daily use\n\nDavines Dede Shampoo While Hagel told us you really need to wash your hair only once or twice a week, some people may find it hard to give up their daily habit. If that sounds like you, this Davines shampoo formulated for all hair types is the only one on the list specifically formulated to be gentle enough to use every day. \u201cDavines shampoos are a favorite of mine,\u201d says Jordan, who notes that they are also organic. \u201cThey use disodium laureth sulfosuccinate as their surfactant, which is considered to be very safe for humans because the molecules are larger than other surfactants and can\u2019t penetrate the skin.\u201d $28 at Amazon Buy $28 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest sulfate-free shampoo for added shine\n\nOUAI Clean Shampoo Dhiran Mistry, a stylist at the David Mallett salon, says that if you\u2019re looking to get some extra radiance from your wash, the good-for-all-hair-types Clean Shampoo from Ouai \u201cwill enhance hair\u2019s natural shine.\u201d He adds that the \u201cgentle and detoxifying\u201d formula contains \u201csmart keratin, which bonds with the hair cuticle to repair and smooth it.\u201d $28 at Sephora Buy\n\nBest keratin-safe sulfate-free shampoo\n\nOribe Shampoo for Moisture and Control While the Ouai shampoo is formulated with keratin, it doesn\u2019t promise to protect keratin-treated hair the way Oribe\u2019s sulfate-free, \u201ckeratin-safe\u201d shampoo does. According to Nicole Mouyal, the manager of Davida Salon, sulfate-free shampoos are generally the best option for keratin- or color-treated hair, and Oribe products are her most-trusted favorite. \u201cOribe products have no sulfates, no parabens, and no salt, which are the three factors that can reverse a keratin treatment,\u201d Mouyal told us. \u201cKeratin is an expensive service, and if you\u2019re investing that much in your hair, you should also invest in products that will care for it.\u201d $46 at Dermstore Buy\n\nBest sulfate-free shampoo for dry hair\n\nBest sulfate-free shampoo for thinning hair\n\nAveda invati\u2122 Advanced Exfoliating Shampoo Speaking of thinning hair, Hagel first told us about Aveda\u2019s Invati line when we asked about the best products to treat the condition. She uses the brand\u2019s three-part system (shampoo, conditioner, and scalp spray) to treat her own thinning hair but explains that you can buy just the shampoo if you\u2019re looking for a sulfate-free option specifically for thinner hair. Beyond the general benefits of going sulfate free, Hagel says it\u2019s a particularly good idea to do so if you\u2019ve got thinning hair, because harsh sulfates won\u2019t help the already sensitive state of your strands. $34 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nBest sulfate-free shampoo for fine hair\n\nLiving Proof Full Shampoo For those with fine hair who need something to give their locks oomph, Mistry says Living Proof\u2019s sulfate-free Full Shampoo is \u201cgreat for creating more volume.\u201d It does so, he explains, by \u201cremoving residue and product buildup on hair and scalp, leaving the roots fuller and less weighed down.\u201d $26 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nBest sulfate-free shampoo for tightly curled hair\n\nPhoto: Retailer Mielle Organics Babassu-Oil Conditioning Sulfate-Free Shampoo Louis says this product is like her favorite Verb Ghost shampoo \u201cbut is incredibly effective for tightly curled hair.\u201d When hair is super-curly, you usually have to rely on a conditioner to do the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d of detangling, she explains. But \u201cyou won\u2019t have to worry about that if you use this,\u201d she says. Like the Verb Ghost, this shampoo is also color safe. $16 at Amazon Buy $16 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
