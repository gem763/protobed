An Oct. 3 hearing is set in the suit.\n\nBigland said in his lawsuit that the company's sales reporting methodology had been in place since the late 1980s and was widely known throughout the company including by Sergio Marchionne, who was chief executive until his death in July 2018, and other senior executives.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, Alistair Bell and Daniel Wallis)", "description": "Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV  and its U.S. unit will pay $40 million for misleading investors about its monthly sales figures and will resolve a lengthy probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
