So that\u2019s what Michael Gove meant by \u201cbumps in the road\u201d after no-deal Brexit. Food prices up. Electricity up. Lorries stuck in the channel ports for days on end. Riots.

Cod wars. Social care collapsing. Shortages of medicines. And the return of the black market! The 21st century spiv may be the abiding legacy of this short tragic Johnson government.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to know what to make of all this. The most offensive part, for me, is the blatant deception. It doesn\u2019t feel right to have been lied to by our leaders. \u201cBumps in the road\u201d sounded like a kind of tranquilliser for the anxious punters: a charming, cosy euphemism, as if we were all going on a jolly excursion to the countryside. (The irony being, of course, that all those truckers and holidaymakers won\u2019t be going on any roads, bumpy or otherwise, once they meet French customs.)\n\nCalling this a \u201creasonable worst case\u201d now is a pathetic attempt to sugarcoat it. It is a contradiction in terms. Do they really take the public for fools? Want to treat us like silly children just because we can\u2019t get our drugs? Because we are liable to panic?\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

It will be awful; Brexit isn\u2019t worth it.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

What on earth could possibly lie behind those ominous blocks of black ink?\n\nMuch if this will chaos will go on for years, if not decades, after a no-deal Brexit. More disruption to trade and travel will be a permanent feature of life.The roads will be forever bumpy \u2013 or blocked. We will permanently porter than we would otherwise be. That is because the government can only do so much to mitigate matters. It will not do the extra admin for businesses; it will not forever subsidise the extra costs. The Department for Business won\u2019t take over car production from Honda, and Defra won\u2019t be getting itself into the hill farming business. Boris Johnson won\u2019t come round and stand in the endless queue at the Post Office for you so you can obtain your international driving permit.\n\nAnd yet Yellowhammer doesn't even touch on the even bigger macroeconomic impact of a no-deal Brexit: the loss of hundreds of thousands of well-paid, skilled jobs in the car industry, in aerospace, farming, fisheries, the City, food and pharmaceuticals \u2013 to name just a few.\n\nWhat about the tariffs on imports? The withdrawal of investment? The drop in the value of sterling? Higher inflation? Shortages of workers in the NHS or the potato fields?\n\nWhat about tariffs on our exports? What will an officially estimated 5 per cent drop in national income do to wages and tax revenues and public service\n\nThere is much more to no-deal Brexit than this short, if terrifying, document suggests. No doubt specially spun \u201cupdates\u201d will be produced, but the public is right to be fearful and sceptical about this huge propaganda exercise.\n\nAs for the censored prorogation papers, well, they really must be dynamite. It will need a court order to drag them out of government \u2013 and I believe they would expose lies directed at everyone from the Queen to Larry the Downing Street cat (\u201cno plans for a car-hating dog to join the team \u2013 a worst case scenario\u201d).\n\nImagine, if you can, how foul mouthed and insulting to the voters and contemptuous of the Palace and MPs that Dominic Cummings could potentially be \u2013 and then multiply it. And then perhaps throw in some casual racism about the French, Irish and Germans. Or maybe something truly disgusting about John Bercow.\n\nThese emails and WhatsApp messages must so bad, so embarrassing, so deplorable that they have to break the law to prevent us reading them.\n\nNo wonder Boris Johnson\u2019s gang didn\u2019t want parliament around.
