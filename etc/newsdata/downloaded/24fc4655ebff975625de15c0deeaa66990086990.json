While Trump is guilty of using the construction, he is far from the only public figure to have appended the definite article.\n\nThe construction of Ukraine\u2019s name has been politically fraught for a number of years, as evidenced by the cheeky tone of the embassy\u2019s tweet.\n\n\"These are the only politically correct terms that express respect to the country and its nation,\" it continued, advising readers to \"be smart and avoid Soviet style clich\u00e9s.\" The tweet closed with an skeptical-looking emoji wearing a monocle.\n\nThat construction has also cropped up in media reports surrounding the allegations that Trump inappropriately pressured Zelenskiy to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, though The Associated Press, whose style guidelines have been adopted by a number of news outlets, dropped the definite article in 1991, in accordance with Ukraine's independence referendum that same year. Critics of the \"the\" argue it belittles Ukraine's status as a sovereign state, reducing back to its status as a former Soviet territory.\n\nSome news outlets use \u201cthe Ukraine\u201d frequently, as did then-President Barack Obama occasionally in the aftermath of the 2014 annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula by Russia.\n\nIn the midst of sparring with reporters during his trip last week to the United Nations, Trump also parroted unsubstantiated claims about the Bidens and their work in \u201cthe Ukraine.\u201d\n\nBut Monday's reminder from the Ukrainian Embassy came shortly after a morning tweet from the man whose presidency has been dealt a major blow by his relations with Ukraine.\n\nTrump, who frequently deletes and re-posts messages on his favorite social media platform, deleted a declaration that \u201cAgain, the President of the Ukraine said THERE WAS NO (ZERO) PRESSURE PUT ON HIM BY ME,\u201d re-posting it minutes later without the \u201cthe.\u201d", "description": "\u2018Be smart and avoid Soviet style clich\u00e9s,\u2019 says embassy in Washington.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1172545186-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
