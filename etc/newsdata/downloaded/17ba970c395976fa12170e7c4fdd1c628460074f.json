Stanford Biology\n\nResearchers at Stanford University School of Medicine, along with other collaborators, tracked the biology of over 100 people and discovered a new means of detecting disease. Their study used data from wearable technology, genome sequencing, and microbial and molecular profiling that gave each person an initial, individual baseline of data.\n\nAs the scientists continued to track the baselines, they also kept tabs on any abnormalities that could signal the development of disease. The team identified 13 disease-related findings, including lymphoma, high blood pressure, and precancers. According to the scientists, many of these findings would have been missed by typical health screens.\n\nLearn about the Stanford University School of Medicine\n\n4. Augmedix\n\nThis innovative startup has reinvented the way Google Glass is used. Augmedix allows doctors to better connect with their patients by changing how documentation and administrative tasks are completed. With Augmedix, Doctors simply wear the smart glasses during appointments and, via a live stream, interact with human transcribers.\n\nThese transcribers access the audio and video feed of the doctor-patient interaction, take notes, and update patient records in real time \u2013 saving doctors up to 15 hours a week on patient charting. Not only does this technology allow patients to connect with their doctors, but it also provides an overall improvement to the quality and accuracy of patient documentation.\n\nLearn about Augmedix\n\nAthos Training System analyzes exercise in a muscle-specific format YouTube/ Athos 5. Athos\n\nThe Athos Training System is one of the few wearable health technologies that comes in the form of actual clothing. This wearable technology includes form-fitting shirts, shorts, and leggings that have plastic panels for an oval-shaped biosignal sensor to be inserted during workouts.\n\nAthos gives athletes and their coaches precise data that combines proprietary muscle activity measures and motion tracking technology. The System analyzes exercise in a muscle-specific format, where athletes can see what muscles they're using and how they're being used \u2013 allowing them to correct themselves when not engaging the right muscle groups, and giving them satisfaction when working the right ones.\n\nLearn about the Athos Training System\n\n6. Atlas Tracking\n\nBody sensing technology is the primary focus of Atlas Tracking.
