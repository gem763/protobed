The combatants \u2014 Twitch, Mixer, and Caffeine, at the moment, although Facebook and YouTube shouldn\u2019t be counted out just yet \u2014 have their own visions for what that looks like, and what it should mean for consumers. To that end, Twitch, Mixer, and Caffeine have begun to compete in earnest over exclusive deals for big names in streaming.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about those deals is that they seem to overlook the internet video elephant in the room: YouTube. Most of the biggest live-streamers on the internet also post videos of their streams to the site, which nets them extra money without making them do more work. That means YouTube is the real winner of this competition for streamers. Twitch and Mixer are spending huge sums on talent \u2014 and YouTube is still reaping the benefits.\n\nYouTube has been the internet\u2019s favorite video hosting site for the last decade; as it\u2019s grown up, it\u2019s changed the texture and culture of the internet. To young people, YouTube is where things happen. Like high school, it\u2019s got its own conventions, dramas, and rivalries. Most big streamers are fairly young themselves, and grew up bathed in the internet\u2019s blue-light glow. To them, YouTube is as familiar as, say, their childhood bedrooms, which makes it a natural home for whatever videos they happen to produce.\n\nThat goes for all the site\u2019s top creators. Turner \u201cTfue\u201d Tenney, who has more than 7 million followers on Twitch \u2014 and who is currently the site\u2019s most followed active channel \u2014 has 11.3 million subscribers on YouTube, and his uploads, which include content from Twitch, routinely clear the million-view mark. That makes him one of YouTube\u2019s top stars, too.\n\nAt present, influence online is platform agnostic. While it\u2019s still possible to make your name on one platform and move your fans elsewhere, there\u2019s no reason to believe that will continue. Just today, YouTube announced it had struck an exclusive live-streaming deal with Lachlan, a Fortnite YouTuber who has 12 million subscribers on the platform. During Fortnite\u2019s \u201cThe End\u201d event a couple weeks ago, he pulled in 198,976 concurrent viewers \u2014 which dwarfed Tim \u201cTimtheTatman\u201d Betar\u2019s stream the next day, which brought 100,000 viewers to Twitch.\n\nIf YouTube decides to enter the live-streaming wars in earnest \u2014 which it shows every sign of doing \u2014 the landscape promises to change dramatically again.", "description": "What\u2019s interesting about those deals is that they seem to overlook the internet video elephant in the room: YouTube.
