The flames caused $24 billion in damage, killed 85 people, and destroyed 18,804 structures according to state records.\n\nNearly a year later, recovery is still ongoing for the thousands of people who lost their loved ones, homes, and in some cases, everything. Some are still sifting through the rubble of their houses, trying to find keepsakes. Others have had the rubble cleared from their land and are trying to decide whether to rebuild or move somewhere safer. Still others sometimes wake up from dreams of flames. More than 90 per cent of Paradise\u2019s 26,800 residents have yet to return, meaning true recovery \u2014 a return to what once was \u2014 may never happen.\n\n\u201cI think I will always kind of be searching for Paradise in a way,\u201d Kristina Peregoy, a Paradise resident who was still sifting through her family\u2019s property as of September, told Gizmodo. \u201cEven though it\u2019s right here in front of my eyes, it\u2019s just not how I remembered it. But I think home is mainly people. I think Paradise people and our community will take Paradise with them wherever they go.\u201d\n\nThe impacts of the Camp Fire have reverberated well beyond the 62,000 hectares it burned through. PG&E, the electric utility that\u2019s equipment sparked the fire amid hot, dry conditions, filed for bankruptcy.\n\nAnd in an effort to shield itself from more liability, it took drastic steps earlier this month to cut power for up to 700,000 customers during a period of extreme fire danger. The company\u2019s CEO said this is what the next decade could look like.\n\nFrom 1990 to 2010, 13.4 million new homes were built at the wildland-urban interface across the U.S., a location where cities and town meld with the forest. It\u2019s also where wildfires pose the greatest risks and has put millions of Americans square in harm\u2019s way as forests become more flammable due to rising temperatures and more erratic weather driven by carbon pollution.\n\nThe shape that recovery ultimately ends up taking in Paradise and the surrounding communities could serve as an example \u2014 or a warning \u2014 to the millions of others living in increasingly dangerous forests.", "description": "For the 36,000 people living in and around Paradise, California, the Camp Fire is a definitive moment that cleaved life into a before period and an after one....", "authors": ["Alex Choros", "Matt Hopkins"], "top_image": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/1dtCEwLuCbw/0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
