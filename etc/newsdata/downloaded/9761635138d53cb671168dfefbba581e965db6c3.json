REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union will have no long-term impact on Ryanair, Chief Executive Michael O\u2019Leary said on Tuesday, adding that the UK would need an EU trade deal and it was unrealistic to think otherwise.\n\n\u201cIf you look out long enough, I don\u2019t think Brexit has any affect on our business,\u201d O\u2019Leary said at a Reuters Newsmaker event in London, adding that he thought Britain and the EU would reach a trade deal and retain the Open Skies aviation agreement.\n\n\u201cThe UK\u2019s national interest is best served, I think, by staying in the European Union.
