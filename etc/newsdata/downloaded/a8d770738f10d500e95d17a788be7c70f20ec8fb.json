Emperor Naruhito ascended the throne on May 1, following the abdication of his father -- former Emperor Akihito -- on April 30, the first Japanese monarch to step down in about 200 years.\n\nEmpress Masako arrives at the Imperial Palace on Tuesday.

The last ceremony was held at the peak of Japan's asset-inflated bubble economy.\n\nHowever, the official added, \"We avoided excessive cost-cutting to maintain the quality of the events.\"\n\nOne cost-reduction measure saw the government decide against following the precedent of erecting a stage in the courtyard of the Imperial Palace for the enthronement ceremony, saving some 300 million yen.\n\nThe government also trimmed 80 million yen from the budget for banquets to be held for attendees of the ceremony -- compared with 1990 -- by reducing the number of invites and events.\n\nAbout 2,600 guests in total have been invited to four banquets. The first is scheduled for Tuesday evening after the enthronement ceremony, with 450 people -- including foreign leaders. The rest will be held on Friday, Oct 29 and 31.\n\nIn the previous accession, a total of 3,400 guests were invited to seven banquets held for four days straight from Nov 12, 1990. On three of those four days, two banquets were held. Among the guests were Britain's Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana.\n\nFor the Daijosai Great Thanksgiving Ceremony scheduled for Nov 14-15, a key imperial succession rite to be performed by the new emperor, the government has reduced the size of the venue hall to be built within the East Gardens of the Imperial Palace.\n\nCosts to restore the area to its original state have been slashed by about 300 million yen from the initial estimate.\n\nSecurity expenses, including police vehicles and equipment, have been cut 1.5 billion yen from the previous accession to 3.8 billion yen, as equipment purchased for hosting the Group of Seven summit in Mie Prefecture in 2016 will be utilized.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "Enthronement events for Emperor Naruhito are expected to cost 16.3 billion yen, up 30 percent from former Emperor Akihito's accession, due mainly to an increase in the number of guests.
