The storm was located about 125 miles east of Melbourne, inching forward at 6 mph northwest.\n\nHURRICANE DORIAN'S PATH: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\nHemmer told Sean Hannity he was surprised by how many residents have chosen to ride out the story in Atlantic Beach.\n\nHe said, \"We have seen so many residents come down to the shore throughout the day today to check out the scene here on the surf and to see the waters rise.\"\n\nThe anchor warned that while Dorian is not expected to hit Florida as it did the Bahamas, residents should still be concerned.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Listen we can all be grateful that this is not going to be the Bahamas, certainly not here in Florida. But there is still trouble out there,\" Hemmer warned. \"And by sunrise tomorrow in this part of Florida it will be wet, Sean. It will be windy, and for the first time, this part of Florida will feel the effects of Dorian, finally.\"\n\nFox News' Travis Fedschun contributed to this report.", "description": "Fox News anchor Bill Hemmer appeared on \"Hannity\" giving the latest on Hurricane Dorian as it crawls toward the Florida coast Tuesday night.", "authors": ["Victor Garcia"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/04/694940094001_6083212015001_6083219207001-vs.jpg"}
