(Francois Lenoir/Reuters)\n\nDaniel W. Drezner is a professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and a regular contributor to PostEverything\n\nLast month, the State Department\u2019s Office of the Inspector General issued a blistering report about the political leadership of the Bureau of International Organization Affairs, in particular Assistant Secretary Kevin Moley and his adviser Mari Stull. After interviewing Foreign Service officers, civil service employees and the top leaders at State, the inspector general found that \u201cthe leadership of IO failed to meet the Department\u2019s Leadership and Management Principles,\u201d specifically, \u201cAssistant Secretary Moley and Ms. Stull frequently berated employees, raised their voices, and generally engaged in unprofessional behavior toward staff.\u201d The inspector general recommended disciplinary action. The State Department, in its response, did not contest the findings of the report.\n\nGiven Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s oft-repeated claim that he is bringing the swagger back to the State Department, and his stated aim to \u201ccreate a culture and an environment where the best and brightest from all across America want to come\u201d to the State Department, one would think that he would wish to take action against Moley (Stull left the State Department in January). After all, he fired Kiron Skinner, his director of policy planning, for a similar pattern of behavior. Nonetheless, Moley remains at his job.\n\nWhy? In response to the inspector general investigation, Moley wrote a rebuttal that contradicted what his superiors said had happened in various instances. David Hale, the undersecretary of state for political affairs, wrote to the inspector general to say that \u201cfurther discipline will be considered following the OIG\u2019s assessment of [Moley\u2019s] response to the draft OIG report.\u201d In its final report, the inspector general responded by saying, \u201cOIG stands by the conclusions set forth in this report,\u201d which is a polite way of saying that Moley is full of it.\n\nMoley remains at his job, however, a fact that has managed to lower morale at State even further, which I did not think was possible in this administration. Nonetheless, Hale and Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan promised a closed-door town hall meeting with State employees to discuss what happened.\n\nForeign Policy\u2019s Colum Lynch and Robbie Gramer found out what went down at that meeting. The good news is that Sullivan and Hale were contrite in their acknowledgment of poor management and did not defend Moley in the slightest:\n\n\u201cI will be the first to admit the failure on my part to have done more to address the situation,\u201d Sullivan told the gathering, according to an account of the meeting relayed to Foreign Policy. Hale encouraged staffers whose careers were damaged as a result of political retaliation to come to him to seek some sort of professional remedy or, if they preferred, to pursue a formal grievance against the department. \u201cI\u2019d like to help; I\u2019d also like people to know they can come to me,\u201d Hale said. He pledged to take their case to the undersecretary of state for management, the director general, or human resources \u201cto make amends.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no doubt that what was going on was completely unacceptable,\u201d Hale said. \u201cMisconduct is a soft word, frankly, to use for what has occurred.\u201d\n\nThe bad news is that according to Lynch and Gramer, Sullivan also claimed that Pompeo could not just fire Moley the way he fired Skinner: \u201cThe secretary can\u2019t fire an assistant secretary appointed by a president, so it adds a layer of complexity there. It doesn\u2019t make it right, it doesn\u2019t make it easier to tolerate, but know that the experience we\u2019ve had with this situation has sensitized, I know.\u201d\n\nThis seems like a good time to ask Pompeo and his communications team some open questions. In a traditional administration, this could be done at the daily State Department briefing. There has not been such a briefing in two weeks, however, and Pompeo is sidelining the media on his latest European trip. So why don\u2019t I just use the Spoiler Alerts platform to ask the secretary some questions about this matter:\n\nSecretary Pompeo, your subordinates claim you cannot just fire an assistant secretary appointed by the president. Surely, however, you can ask the president to do it. You are reputed to have a close relationship with President Trump; he would be likely to listen to your advice on your own department. Have you asked President Trump to fire Kevin Moley? If not, why? Secretary Pompeo, even if Trump refuses to fire Moley, surely there are administrative steps that could be taken to sideline his supervisory role. Do you at least plan on taking such steps? Secretary Pompeo, your subordinates acknowledged Moley\u2019s mismanagement and encouraged Foreign Service officers whose careers were harmed by Moley and Stull to seek redress. Given that Moley remains in his position, however, how much do you think Foreign Service officers will trust your team to do what is right? Wouldn\u2019t they fear retribution from a political appointee who has not paid any price for past abuses? Secretary Pompeo, you claim that you want your diplomats to have swagger, and feel that they are joining an organization that promotes the best and the brightest. How persuasive will these claims be if you cannot remove an official who your own team acknowledges has behaved badly? Secretary Pompeo, your deputy secretary is expected to be nominated the next U.S. ambassador to Russia. What assurances can you give that this personnel matter will not fall between the cracks of Sullivan\u2019s departure and whatever acting deputy secretary will serve for the next several months until the president nominates a permanent successor?\n\nI do not expect answers to these questions.\n\nIn their story, Lynch and Gramer quoted a State Department attendee who said that the \u201cgeneral vibe after the meeting was a mix of bitter disappointment and depression.\u201d That is probably because Trump has managed to replace the worst secretary of state in living memory with the second worst.", "description": "So much for swagger.", "authors": ["Daniel W.
