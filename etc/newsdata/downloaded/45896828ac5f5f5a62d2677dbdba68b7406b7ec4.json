The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the team was still sorting through the results and putting together a timetable for his return.\n\nESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter, citing league sources, tweeted that the MRI result was a \u201cbest-case scenario\u201d. That means a limited absence for the reigning league Most Valuable Player of \u201cabout three games\u201d, Schefter reported.\n\nKansas City Chiefs throttle Broncos but lose Patrick Mahomes to knee injury Read more\n\nThe Chiefs play Green Bay a week from Sunday, then face the Vikings and Titans before a Monday night matchup against Tennessee on 18 November. The Chiefs (5-2) have their bye the following week, so it is possible they hold Mahomes out until their game against Oakland on 1 December.\n\n\u201cThe kid had the MRI and we don\u2019t have all the information. That\u2019s what I can give you,\u201d Chiefs coach Andy Reid said Friday. \u201cOnce we get the information, we can give you everything that kind of happened and what\u2019s going on down the road. The whole deal.\u201d\n\nMahomes was hurt during the Chiefs\u2019 30-6 win in Denver on Thursday night while sneaking for first down on fourth-and-short deep in Broncos territory. Everyone jumped up from the pile but Mahomes, who quickly reached for his right knee as trainers rushed onto the field.\n\nPhysicians used what is called a reduction maneuver to guide the patella back into place, and Mahomes was helped to his feet and shooed away a waiting cart. As players from both teams gathered to pat him on the back, Mahomes limped off the field and to the locker room with little assistance.\n\nMahomes was only in the X-ray room for a couple minutes before he was ruled out.\n\nThe Chiefs led 13-6 when Mahomes left and journeyman quarterback Matt Moore, who was signed just before the season when backup Chad Henne broke his ankle, finished the game. Moore wound up going 10 of 19 for 117 yards, a good chunk of it coming on a 57-yard scoring strike to Tyreek Hill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to do, really the whole thing he\u2019s done, coming in late to us,\u201d Reid said. \u201cThen it\u2019s hard to be a relief pitcher. He\u2019s done it before. There\u2019s a certain way to prep for that and he understands that. It paid off for him. The best part is we didn\u2019t have to change up a lot of things. The hard thing is if the guy comes in, the backup, and you have to change the whole offense.\u201d\n\nReid indicated that Moore would be the starter going forward, and that rookie Kyle Shurmur \u2013 the son of longtime NFL coach Pat Shurmur \u2013 could be elevated from the practice squad as the backup.\n\n\u201cI shorted some throws and missed some stuff, some stuff I think the quarterback should hit,\u201d Moore said, \u201cbut I kind of got into a little rhythm there as the game went on and Coach Reid had a nice flow going on with play calls and made me feel comfortable as we went on down.\u201d\n\nHenne is making progress and could be ready to come off injured reserve in Week 8.\n\nMoore and the Chiefs have the benefit of a few extra days by virtue of playing Thursday night, though Reid said he was following through on his plan to give the team a few days off. The team will reconvene after the weekend before a Sunday night showdown against the Packers.\n\nBy that point, the Chiefs could have wide receiver Sammy Watkins back from a hamstring injury, and left tackle Eric Fisher (groin) and left guard Andrew Wylie (ankle) could be close to returning.\n\n\u201cAgain, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have to change the whole offense,\u201d Reid said, \u201cbut definitely that is part of being a coach and knowing your players. You want to put them in the best position for what they do best, then work on those things to get them better on the things they don\u2019t do best.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll look at what (Moore) does best and talk and put together a good game plan.\u201d", "description": "The NFL\u2019s reigning MVP escaped significant ligament damage when he dislocated his right kneecap during Thursday night\u2019s win over Denver", "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc0ac933cffc7b9cebe7e7e6202c9d24afaa891d/0_51_4093_2456/master/4093.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f51125fe61a1c79a024f2a230ec37a4f", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
