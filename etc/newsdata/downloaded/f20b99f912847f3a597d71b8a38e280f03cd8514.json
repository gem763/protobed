Held in Hawaii rather than Japan, they would cost about $100 million per launch.\n\n\u201cJapan is waiting to hear back from the U.S. Missile Defense Agency about what tests will be required,\u201d said one of the sources. \u201cThose tests haven\u2019t been budgeted for.\u201d\n\nAs part of a major defence upgrade, Japan in 2018 agreed to buy the land-based Aegis Ashore sites offered by Washington, rejecting a new U.S. Navy radar offered by Raytheon Co (RTN.N) in favour of one designed by rival Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N).\n\nThe Japanese defence minister at the time, Itsunori Onodera, did not know Japan would also have to pay for missile launches to test the Lockheed radar, the sources said. One of the defence sources said the Japanese government had thought computer-simulated tests would be sufficient.\n\nAll four asked not to be identified because they are not authorised to talk to the media.\n\nAn official at Onodera\u2019s parliamentary office declined a request to interview the senior ruling party lawmaker about the issue. It is unclear whether other Japanese officials knew about the tests.\n\n\u201cThat topic would have been addressed in government-to-government discussions,\u201d said Lockheed Martin spokeswoman Mona Neuhass. \u201cRegardless of the radar selected, a live fire test will be required to verify the fire-control loop.\u201d\n\nJapan\u2019s Ministry of Defence said it had no immediate comment.\n\nThe Japanese government, among the top three foreign buyers of U.S. military hardware for the past three years, must now explain additional spending on a multibillion-dollar project.\n\nThe contract for the Aegis Ashore systems has not yet been signed. The systems are scheduled to be operational by 2024.\n\n\u201cIt may be an opportunity for Japan to rethink Aegis Ashore in favour of integrated air missile defence,\u201d said one of the sources, who is familiar with Japan\u2019s military planning.\n\nIntegrated air missile defence (IAMD) is a broader approach to defence, with multiple components to counter threats ranging from warheads plunging from space to lower-altitude attacks such as cruise missiles.\n\nThis year, North Korea tested ballistic missiles whose warheads appeared to manoeuvre in flight, making them harder to shoot down.\n\nLockheed Martin referred requests to comment on new North Korean missiles to Japan\u2019s Ministry of Defense and the Missile Defense Agency.\n\nSo far Japan has budgeted $1.2 billion for Aegis Ashore hardware but expects other costs, including construction, maintenance and operational expenses over three decades to put the final tally for two sites at $4.31 billion.\n\nHiranao Honda, a lawmaker with the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and director of its security division, said the additional costs showed the programme should be shut down.\n\n\u201cThere are a series of costs that have yet to be budgeted for, such as construction, and we still have to pay for the missiles. There has not been an adequate explanation from the government,\u201d said Honda, who has requested more details from the defence ministry on Aegis Ashore costs.\n\nHe noted that Japan already had eight warships with a similar but less-capable Aegis system that can attack incoming missiles.\n\nALARM\n\nA recent series of short-range missile tests by Pyongyang, which U.S. President Donald Trump dismissed as unimportant, have prompted alarm in Japan.\n\nFormer defence chief Takeshi Iwaya said last month that those launches appeared to test new missiles with irregular trajectories designed to penetrate ballistic missile defences, including the Aegis Ashore stations. Typically, such defence systems are designed to counter projectiles on predictable flight paths.\n\nBoth Lockheed Martin\u2019s Solid-State Radar and Raytheon\u2019s SPY-6, which the U.S. Navy is putting in its latest Aegis-equipped ships, promise a major boost to Aegis\u2019s ability to detect and hit incoming targets.\n\nJapan will also have to buy interceptor missiles along with the radar. The latest missile for the Aegis system, the SM-3 Block IIA, jointly developed by Japan\u2019s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T) and Raytheon, cost about $30 million each.\n\nUsing some of those missiles for tests would add to the cost of setting up the system, as would paying for targets that mimic incoming warheads.\n\nTESTS OVERSEAS\n\nHolding those tests in Japan could crank up tensions in East Asia, so Tokyo would conduct them at a more isolated test site in Hawaii, according to three of the sources.\n\nJapan would have to pay for a temporary Aegis Ashore site there as well as interceptors, including the pricey Block IIA, which would be destroyed in any test.\n\nAside from personnel and target missiles, Japan would also pay for an exclusion zone to keep commercial shipping and aircraft away from the tests.\n\nOne test could cost about $100 million, according to one of the sources, who has knowledge of past tests conducted by the United States in Hawaii.\n\nConfiguring Aegis Ashore to fire other interceptors that could target newer North Korean would require additional tests, he added.", "description": "Additional tests may add at least $500 million (\u00a3405.5 million) to Japan's price tag for two U.S.-built ballistic missile interceptor stations that could struggle to shoot down the latest North Korean missile types, four government and defence sources said.", "authors": ["Tim Kelly", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434404466&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0AK", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
