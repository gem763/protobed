The unrest spread to several mostly Shi'ite Muslim southern cities.\n\nPolice used live ammunition from the first day and clashes have now killed at least 110 people, according to a Reuters toll based on reports from police and medics. The interior ministry gave a casualty toll of 104 killed and more than 6,000 wounded. It said eight of the dead were security forces.\n\nIt is the bloodiest unrest and biggest challenge to Iraq's security since the declared defeat of Islamic State in 2017 and has shaken Abdul Mahdi's year-old government.\n\nThe government has agreed to increase subsidized housing for the poor, stipends for the unemployed and training programs and loan initiatives for youth.\n\nIraqi authorities also said they would hold to account members of the security forces who \"acted wrongly\" in a harsh crackdown on dissent, state TV reported on Monday. The interior ministry denies government forces have shot directly at protesters.\n\nThe protesters demand the overhaul of what they say is an entire corrupt system and political class that has held the country back, despite unprecedented levels of security since the end of the war against IS.
