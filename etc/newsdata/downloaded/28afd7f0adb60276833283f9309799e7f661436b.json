Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) is using an alleged smear by Hillary Clinton to raise money for her presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton accused Tulsi Gabbard \u2014 a combat veteran, soldier and Major in the Army National Guard \u2014 of being \u2018groomed\u2019 to be a \u2018Russian asset,'\u201d the campaign said in a fundraising email sent out on Saturday.\n\nIn the email, Gabbard stated, \u201c[Clinton] finally came out from behind the curtain yesterday, accusing me of being a Russian asset.\u201d She then asked her supporters to donate $25 to her campaign.\n\n\u201cIf this is a fight she wants to have, one that has implications for all of us and the future of our democracy, then I challenge her to come out from behind her proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media, and face me directly,\u201d the email concluded.\n\nOn Friday, Breitbart News reported that Clinton allegedly called Gabbard a \u201cfavorite of the Russians\u201d and added that Jill Stein, the likely candidate to be the Green Party nominee, was a \u201cRussian asset.\u201d\n\nHowever, Gabbard blasted Clinton in a series of tweets on Friday, labeling her the \u201cqueen of warmongers\u201d:\n\nGreat!

Pollak.\n\n\u201cWe must not let Hillary Clinton and her establishment allies silence the voice of the American people and quash all those who dare to offer a dissenting voice in response to our corrupt status quo,\u201d Gabbard\u2019s fundraising email stated.", "description": "Rep.
