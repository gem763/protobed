REUTERS/Joaquin Salguero\n\nBUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentine President Mauricio Macri told a crowd of thousands of supporters on Saturday that he could still turn the tide and win the upcoming presidential election, despite his main opponent\u2019s wide lead.\n\nThe event, which drew massive crowds to the Buenos Aires neighborhood of Belgrano, was the first of 30 marches across the South American country that Macri called for as part of his re-election campaign ahead of the Oct. 27 presidential election.\n\nAfter arriving by train, Macri told the crowd he understood the message voters sent him in the primary election.\n\n\u201cYou are not alone,\u201d Macri said. \u201cYou are waiting for me to tell you that this election can be turned around. Of course it can.\u201d\n\nMacri lost serious ground in the Aug. 11 primary election to Peronist opposition candidate Alberto Fernandez, who is now widely expected to win the election. The stunning results of the primary - a nearly 16-point lead by Fernandez- sparked a market sell-off and eventually led the government to introduce currency controls in order to stop a slide in the peso currency.\n\nOn Saturday supporters held blue and white balloons, waved Argentine flags and carried signs reading \u201cyes, we can,\u201d the slogan Macri has used in his social media posts to garner support for his campaign.\n\nThe march, which was also attended by several prominent politicians from Macri\u2019s coalition, represents his first major campaign effort since his primary election defeat. Recent polling predicts that Fernandez has enough support to win the election outright in October.\n\nThe next march for Macri\u2019s campaign is scheduled for Monday in Buenos Aires province, with others scheduled later in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces.", "description": "Argentine President Mauricio Macri told a crowd of thousands of supporters on Saturday that he could still turn the tide and win the upcoming presidential election, despite his main opponent's wide lead.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1435022298&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R0UT-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
