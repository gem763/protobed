Wow! I mean, I\u2019d love to be on an episode. I have to be honest, I haven\u2019t seen an episode but that\u2019s because I was so involved with being a dancer and chasing my dream of becoming a wrestler, I just didn\u2019t watch TV. So, I missed out on the Australian thing.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pair \u2013 who met at high school and eventually bonded over their love for professional wrestling \u2013 admitted they would love to follow Billie\u2019s idol Dwayne \u2018The Rock\u2019 Johnson into acting one day, but their real goal is to just \u2018entertain\u2019.\n\n\u2018We just wanna be in the entertainment industry, we want to stay in that field,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018At the end of the day, we just want to entertain people. Wherever that takes us in the future,we\u2019re excited and intrigued to pursue that wherever it takes us!\u2019\n\nIllonics (Picture: WWE)\n\nHowever, the team\u2019s real passion and ambitions lie in the world of wrestling \u2013 even after an incredible year which saw them realise their dreams with the huge WrestleMania moment.\n\nPeyton added: \u2018First of all, being in the match at WrestleMania was bucket list for us! That was our first opportunity, and to be on the show and win the tag team titles at WrestleMania. You can see how much that meant to us.\n\n\u2018We got so much love from people reaching out to us from colleagues to friends and family, to fans, recognising how important that moment was to us and what it really meant. All that emotion afterwards was 15 years of us grinding for that one moment. That\u2019s gonna be something that we cherish forever.\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s not all for the BFFs though, who conceded at this point that any other highlights are a bonus. So what\u2019s left?\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a funny question,\u2019 Peyton said. \u2018We\u2019ve ticked off so many of our goals so quickly. Anything else is just a cherry on top! One of our goals is obviously to be inducted into the Hall of Fame, when the time comes \u2013 if there\u2019s room!\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeyton and Billie in the Hall of Fame? That really would be IIconic!\n\n*Friday Night SmackDown airs every week at 1am on Sky Sports Arena and Main Event.
