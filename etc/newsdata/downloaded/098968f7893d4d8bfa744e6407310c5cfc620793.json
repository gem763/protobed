This is because, with a letter \u201cobjecting\u201d to the very possibility of his impeachment by Congress, Trump has announced his intention to defy the Constitution itself.\n\nThe declaration leaves Barr with a stark choice: Will he employ the Department of Justice to defend a president\u2019s open and notorious violation of the Constitution?", "description": "Trump\u2019s DOJ is arguing that Congress should never have heard Nixon\u2019s \u201csmoking gun\u201d tape and should be barred from reviewing any further evidence of Trump\u2019s criminality.", "authors": ["David R.
