Not to be outdone by their larger neighbor, the Emiratis prepared a few welcoming gestures \u2013 some of which ended up just a bit off-kilter.\n\nAfter being personally greeted in Abu Dhabi by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Putin went to the Qasr Al Watan royal palace by motorcade \u2013 escorted by several cars that might seem painfully familiar to every ordinary Russian driver. The white Mercedes\u2019 Emirati licence plates contrasted with the large blue letters \u0414\u041f\u0421 on their hoods \u2013 copying the color scheme of the Russian road police patrols.\n\nThe \u2018patrol\u2019 was then replaced by horsemen carrying Russian and Emirati flags, an impressive sight, though perhaps not as impressive as the Mongolian president\u2019s Genghis Khan cavalry. But the spectacle was complemented by a seemingly casual aerobatics squad flyover \u2013 trailing smoke in the colors of the Russian flag.\n\nFinally, upon his arrival at the palace, Putin was treated to a local rendition of the Russian anthem \u2013 which could only be called pleasant when compared to the Saudis\u2019 bungled performance the day before, but that\u2019s not setting the bar very high. Although, judging by his expression, the Russian president wasn\u2019t expecting much anyway.\n\nAlso on rt.com Sounds grate!
