A century on, scientists have recreated his images to show the impact of global heating on the mountain\u2019s glaciers.\n\nDr Kieran Baxter and Dr Alice Watterson from the University of Dundee used a process called monoplotting to work out the precise locations from which Mittelholzer had taken his photographs. They returned to the spot in a helicopter and lined up their cameras using the alpine peaks as their guide.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Walter Mittelholzer, the Swiss pilot and photographer who flew over Mont Blanc in a biplane in 1919.

In the 1800s, travel writers described how it could be seen from the resort town of Chamonix, but it has since receded more than 2km up the mountain\u2019s slopes.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kieran Baxter at one of the Mont Blanc glaciers found to have diminished.

He died in a climbing accident in 1937.\n\nArgenti\u00e8re glacier in 1919 and 2019 Argenti\u00e8re glacier: the change over a century.\n\nBaxter said: \u201cMittelholzer played a key role in popularising commercial air travel in Switzerland, an industry which ironically came to contribute to the warming of the climate \u2013 and the detriment of the alpine landscapes.\u201d\n\nThe Dundee scientists said they were careful to keep their own impact on the environment to a minimum.\n\nMer de Glace glacier in 1919 and 2019 How the Mer de Glace glacier has changed over a century.\n\n\u201cWhen working at these heights there is currently no viable emission-free alternative so airtime is kept as brief as possible and careful planning goes into getting the most out of a photography flight like this one,\u201d said Baxter.\n\n\u201cLuckily, clear weather allowed these repeat aerial photographs to be taken on the centenary year of the originals. Unless we drastically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, there will be little ice left to photograph in another hundred years.\u201d", "description": "A century after Walter Mittelholzer\u2019s famous aerial mission, scientists repeat his journey to shed light on the impact of global heating", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/941fd18e188c61c3b26f841f138ebaecf2cc9cf5/0_325_4096_2457/master/4096.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=73f968f816ac9de30ec544ccb77c67d3", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
