I\u2019d been in the new room for a few weeks when I got the call from Human Resources. A pleasant-sounding young man said, \u201cMr. Mosley, it has been reported that you used the N-word in the writers\u2019 room.\u201d\n\nI replied, \u201cI am the N-word in the writers\u2019 room.\u201d\n\nHe said, very nicely, that I could not use that word except in a script. I could write it but I could not say it. Me. A man whose people in America have been, among other things, slandered by many words. But I could no longer use that particular word to describe the environs of my experience.", "description": "", "authors": ["Walter Mosley", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Sunday Walter-Mosley.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
