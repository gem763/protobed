REUTERS/Staff/File Photo\n\nBy 0820 GMT, the pan-European STOXX 600 was little changed, with bourses in Germany .GDAXI, Spain .IBEX and Italy .FTMIB rising about 0.2%.\n\nEricsson (ERICb.ST) was the index\u2019s top performer, jumping 6.4% after posting quarterly core earnings that were well ahead of expectations and lifting its 2020 sales target. Shares of Finnish peer Nokia (NOKIA.HE) also gained 3.4%.\n\n\u201cThere was a consensus view on Ericsson that maybe they\u2019ve disappointed on the margins which was holding people back,\u201d said Mark Taylor, sales trader at Mirabaud.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of demand to get into the 5G theme, and Ericsson\u2019s probably the biggest, most liquid name in Europe to play that theme.\u201d\n\nComing off its best weekly performance since February, the STOXX 600 has fallen modestly since last Friday in a week dominated by worries over whether UK will be able to seal a deal to smoothly leave the European Union by Oct. 31.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party maintained on Thursday that it could not support the withdrawal agreement proposed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the European Union in its current form.\n\nThat stoked doubts over whether Johnson will be able to win the British parliament\u2019s approval for any deal, although talks are continuing.\n\n\u201cWe also know that if the DUP doesn\u2019t go for it, then it\u2019s likely that neither will many of the hardline pro-Brexit Conservative MPs who\u2019ve rejected the deal in the past,\u201d said ING economist James Smith.\n\nLondon's blue-chip FTSE 100 .FTSE outperformed with a 0.4% rise as the index's export-focused firms benefited from a weakness in the pound. The domestically-focused midcaps index .FTMC, however, dropped 0.3% and Irish shares fell 0.3%\n\nFears of a slide into recession continue to dog Europe and not all earnings were upbeat, with banking software maker Temenos (TEMN.S) tumbling more than 13%, its worst day in more than four years, after traders said third-quarter core profits missed expectations.\n\nNestle (NESN.S) was the biggest drag on the benchmark index as organic sales growth dipped in the third quarter, outweighing the announcement of a plan to buy back up to 20 billion Swiss francs ($20.13 billion) in shares.\n\nShares of Pernod Ricard (PERP.PA) slipped 2.8% after the spirits maker missed expectations for quarterly organic sales, reflecting slower growth rates in China and India and French car parts group Faurecia (EPED.PA) dropped 6.9% after posting lower-than-expected third quarter sales.\n\n(This story has been refiled to add missing number for Irish share move)", "description": "European stocks recovered from a weak start on Thursday, helped by strong earnings from Swedish telecoms gear maker Ericsson as signs of continuing political barriers to a Brexit deal hit domestically-focused UK firms.", "authors": ["Medha Singh", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441781191&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G0IM", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
