'Milk is good for you' \u2013 a nugget our mothers ingrained into our minds for years, but should we really incorporate milk into our diets?\n\nMilk is a whole food which provides 18 out of 22 essential nutrients, including calcium, magnesium, potassium, zinc and protein. But unfortunately, approximately 75% of the world\u2019s population isn\u2019t able to break down lactose; a core ingredient in milk.\n\n\n\nAnd despite its benefits, milk may put you at risk for some conditions.\n\nFor example, research shows that countries with the lowest rates of dairy and calcium intake also have the lowest rates of osteoporosis. Besides this, there are other reasons why you should reconsider having milk and other forms of dairy in your diet.\n\nWhy milk could be bad for you\n\nIt may cause acne\n\nA study in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology shows that teenagers with acne are those who drink large amounts of low-fat or skim milk. A group of 225 teens aged 14 to 19 with both acne and no acne were used.\n\nThe amount of milk they included in their diet was monitored and after three 24-hour recall interviews, it was found that those with acne had a significantly higher amount of milk in their diet.\n\nIt may increase the risk of cancer\n\nStudies have found that excess calcium from milk and other foods may increase the risk of certain cancers and specifically, prostate cancer by 30-50% in men.\n\nIt was also found that sugars found naturally in milk may be linked to a higher risk of ovarian cancer in women.\n\nMore research is needed, but current research finds that the growth hormones given to cows often contain high levels of chemicals that may increase the risk of developing these cancers.\n\nIt may trigger allergic reactions\n\nMilk allergies are common in both adults and children. Including milk in your diet may trigger allergic reactions if you are sensitive to milk and milk products.\n\nSymptoms may include wheezing, difficulty breathing, blood in stool, constipation, diarrhoea, and worsening skin conditions like eczema. Sensitivity to casein, a protein in milk, can cause other reactions, which include sinus congestion, skin rashes and migraines.\n\nIt can raise bad cholesterol\n\nThere are two types of cholesterol; good and bad.\n\nIf your body has an excess of bad cholesterol, your arteries could get blocked, increasing your risk of heart disease. Milk contains saturated and trans fats, both of which can increase levels of bad cholesterol in your body.\n\nDrink this instead\n\nIf you can\u2019t bear to swap to black coffee or weak tea, don\u2019t worry. There are healthy milk alternatives you can try.\n\nSoy milk\n\nSoy milk has a creamy, mild taste and similar nutritional values to cow\u2019s milk. It\u2019s made from whole soybeans or soy protein isolate. It\u2019s a good source of protein, and vitamins B, D, and E. It should be used in moderation though, as it may cause digestive issues like bloating and gas.\n\nAlmond milk\n\nWith its sweet, nutty flavour, almond milk is a great alternative to cow\u2019s milk. It\u2019s low in calories, fat and carbohydrates, so it\u2019s a great option if you\u2019re watching your weight. The only downside is that it\u2019s low in protein and contains a substance called phytic acid which may limit the absorption of zinc, calcium and iron in your body.\n\nCoconut milk\n\nCoconut milk is made from the flesh of coconuts and water. It has a creamy, milk-like consistency and tastes sweet. It contains no protein and little to no carbohydrates. It does have lauric acid, which helps lower high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which improves heart health. Sip in moderation though, as it\u2019s packed with medium-chain triglycerides, a type of saturated fat.\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "'Milk is good for you' \u2013 a nugget our mothers ingrained into our minds for years, but should we really incorporate milk into our diets?", "authors": ["Aaqeelah Floris"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9232/3f79f0c51d404fd294b03d132c64b00b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-14"}
