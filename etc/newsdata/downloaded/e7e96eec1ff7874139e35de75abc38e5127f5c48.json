Our Writer Had Her Doubts", "language": "en", "text": "One morning in June, I opened my email to find an itinerary for a trip \u2014 a \u201ctransformational journey,\u201d rather \u2014 that would begin that very day. I quickly packed a bag and caught a last-minute flight from Berlin, where I live, to Lisbon.\n\nBy the time I landed, I\u2019d received another email, this one containing a bulleted list of questions: \u201cWhat\u2019s your \u2018story\u2019 about who you are, where you are from, what you do? Are you being the Victim or Creator of your life? Hint,\u201d the email continued, \u201cthe best way to go from Victim to Creator is to ask yourself the very questions I asked in my previous email: \u2018What do I want?\u2019 and \u2018What do I need to do now to get it?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe emails were from my \u201ctravel mentor,\u201d Michael Bennett, co-founder of Explorer X, a Seattle-based agency that creates custom trips designed to provide a \u201clife-changing travel experience.\u201d Explorer X is part of a growing group of companies specializing in what\u2019s known as transformational travel. If experiential travel signifies engaging meaningfully with the people, history, environment and culture of a destination (like a local, not a tourist), then transformational travel is supposedly the next step: Engage so meaningfully, the trip actually changes you.\n\nThis can mean extreme adventure travel, as with companies like Britain-based Pelorus, which offers heli-skiing guided by retired military on active volcanoes in Kamchatka, and immersions with indigenous cultures in Angola and Papua New Guinea. Or it can mean wellness-inflected, small-group trips aimed at building fellowship, as with a slew of female-focused companies like WHOA Travel, which connects its groups with local women to \u201ccreate experiences and friendships that will change the way you view the world and yourself forever.\u201d There is often a sustainability or public service angle. A newer iteration doubles down on the element of surprise. Black Tomato , a New York- and London-based agency, recently debuted a \u201cGet Lost\u201d service, which drops travelers into remote destinations, requiring them to find their way out (tag line: \u201cYou need to get lost to find yourself\u201d).", "description": "Seeing the world \u2018through new eyes,\u2019 was the aim of a rigorously planned trip to Portugal, offered by a new breed of tour operator.
