A second-class stamp can be worth more if it has a fault.\n\nThe rest are sold as used stamps for crafting or paper recycling.\n\nCharities have raised millions over the years. Blue Peter's stamp appeal in 1962, when viewers were asked to collect them to raise money for the homeless, brought in more than 948 million stamps.\n\nUK organisations that still use stamps to raise money include Oxfam, Macmillan, Parkinson's UK and the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB).\n\nTypically, the RNIB raises between \u00a310,000 and \u00a320,000 per year from donated stamps, but so far this year it has raised \u00a323,450.\n\nA spokesman says: 'RNIB can raise vital funds from the donation of used stamps. It's an easy way to support the charity's work in smashing the barriers that still exist for people living with sight loss, and we're incredibly grateful to everyone who donates their stamps.'\n\nParkinson's UK receives around 1,000 stamps per month and, so far this year, has raised \u00a36,000 recycling them along with jewellery, old currency, mobile phones, gadgets, ink cartridges and cars.\n\nMacmillan raised \u00a32,000 from stamps last year, and is on track for the same figure in 2019.\n\nPlenty of smaller charities are trying to encourage stamp donations, too.\n\nBottle caps can make money too! Milk bottle tops GHS Recycling in Portsmouth pays \u00a330 to charity for every 500 kg of bottle tops donated. They must be clean and free of paper, rubber or foil. Details are at ghsrecycling.co.uk/charity-scheme Ink cartridges You can recycle most brands, including HP, Dell, Lexmark, Samsung and Neopost, but they must not be damaged. Recycle4charity (recycle 4charity.co.uk) only accepts cartridges that have not been refilled and that do not carry any other branding than the manufacturer's. For every recycled cartridge, \u00a31 is given to charity. The Recycling Factory (therecyclingfactory.com) offers different sums depending on the brand and type. For example, it will donate \u00a31.50 for a 'virgin' Canon CL-41 cartridge, or 75p if it has been refilled. Old clothes Rags 2 Riches 4 Schools (rags2riches4schools.co.uk) pays 50p per kilogram of good quality, clean, reusable clothes, shoes and accessories, including bags, belts and jewellery, from schools. The money can be donated to the school or to a charity. Mobile phones You can donate old phones to Oxfam, WaterAid or the National Trust via Fonebank (fonebank.com). You may find you get more by selling to a non-charitable firm, then donating the cash, so check comparison sites first.\n\nThe Bone Cancer Research Trust reported that donations have tapered recently. It received \u00a313,000 worth of stamp donations in 2018, yet so far this year has raised only \u00a35,000.\n\nVolunteers at the trust, based in Essex, are concerned that stamp donations are slowing because younger generations communicate more by phone.\n\nTerri Bush, a stamp appeal co-ordinator at the trust, says: 'Rather than putting pen to paper, younger generations are more inclined to use text messages or emails.\n\n'We want more people to get involved in collecting stamps for smaller charities that can benefit greatly.'\n\nMrs Bush says the trust looks forward to January, when many people donate lots of used stamps from Christmas cards.\n\nShe adds: 'Christmas is a busy time for people sending and receiving cards and gifts from other parts of the UK, as well as overseas.\n\n'Collecting stamps costs you nothing, and you can do something useful with something you would have otherwise thrown away.'\n\nSome charities will also accept donations of stamp collections \u2014 old and new \u2014 which can be more lucrative than used everyday stamps because they can be sold to collectors to raise extra funds.\n\nOliver Rudd, of dealer Meridian Stamps, says: 'The supply of stamps is falling, so prices have increased dramatically as commemorative picture stamps, such as the recent Elton John set, are very hard to come by in used condition.\n\n'This has escalated to the point where a used modern stamp can be worth more than a mint one.\n\n'Even everyday definitive stamps [featuring the Queen's head] are collectible, as there are more than 1,700 varieties depending on printing methods, dates, values and so on.'\n\nAnyone collecting stamps for donation needs to ensure they have about a centimetre of envelope paper around them, and the perforations should not be damaged.\n\nAsk charities about your stamp donation before you send anything \u2014 they can be choosy about what they will accept, with some welcoming only full stamp collections rather than used stamps.\n\nMost charities give an address on their website for where to post stamps, but you will need to pay postage \u2014 they don't typically provide freepost addresses.\n\nmoneymail@dailymail.co.uk", "description": "Every kilogram of UK stamps - around 6,000 - is worth about \u00a310.
