He has been a valued source of mine for years.\n\n\u201cThe country is armed to the hilt,\u201d Leege wrote:\n\n\u201cAs president, Trump has resisted any effort to curb citizen access to guns and ammo. He puts on a modest show of concern when a particularly bad gun massacre occurs but, in the end, he sees armed citizens as a significant personal asset.\u201d\n\nLeege went on to speculate about what might happen in the worst of circumstances:\n\n\u201cI think the legal profession, finance, and corporate business would resist Trump\u2019s efforts toward a coup. They need stability to make profits. Perhaps the biggest question concerns the military. Coups are usually backstopped by colonels, not generals. Thus, major barracks could provide him with support. Probably his best strategy to keep all levels of the military loyal to him rather than to the Constitution would be to embroil us in a major war.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Thomas Edsall", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Trump-Leave-White-House.Html"], "top_image": ""}
