The decision is expected to be formalised through a written procedure. \u2014 Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) October 28, 2019\n\nEU has agreed #Brexit extension but needs PM to sign off on it before it\u2019s formalised. VERY uncomfortable for die in a ditch Boris Johnson. He has tried to distance himself as much as possible from this new extension he swore he\u2019d never seek .. https://t.co/fuFuh327Ch \u2014 katya adler (@BBCkatyaadler) October 28, 2019\n\nUK will not be leaving the EU on October 31. Extension granted until Jan 31. This is the third delay to Brexit. Two under Theresa May (March 29, April 12). One under Boris Johnson (\u2018Do or die\u2019 on Halloween) https://t.co/oZSeJ3fVUv \u2014 Beth Rigby (@BethRigby) October 28, 2019\n\nSo what's in the Brexit flextension agreement? Key points: pic.twitter.com/tDu5fBuyIQ \u2014 Nikos Chrysoloras (@nchrysoloras) October 28, 2019\n\nWhat many lawmakers and E.U. officials fear above all else is that they will reach this deadline without having agreed a deal at all. This \"no deal\" Brexit scenario could cause chaos for the U.K. and its neighbors, possibly triggering economic pain, food shortages and civil unrest. But Parliament is deadlocked because it can't agree which E.U. rules to keep and which to scrap. London has become so closely tied to this continental union that unpicking these will be a complex process. Meanwhile, Johnson wants an early general election that could secure him the parliamentary majority to deliver his Brexit plans \u2014 and perhaps more importantly bolster his power as prime minister.
