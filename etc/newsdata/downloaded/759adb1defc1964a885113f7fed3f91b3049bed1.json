Are you upset?\u201d Scott Disick asks in the clip and Kim responds, \u201cNo, \u2019cause I mean, it was my fault. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t drink.\u201d\n\nDays after the holiday bash, which was attended by guests like Paris Hilton, Jennifer Lopez and John Legend, multiple reports claimed that Kardashian was adding to her brood.\n\nKardashian and West were already parents to daughters Chicago, 1, and North, 6, and son Saint, 3.\n\nKardashian later confirmed the news herself during an appearance on \u201cWatch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen,\u201d revealing that the baby would be born \u201csometime soon.\u201d\n\nTheir son Psalm was born in May via surrogate.\n\nIn the clip, the reality star says she\u2019s \u201cso excited\u201d for the new arrival despite having some anxiety early on.\n\n\u201cLook at your mom, she\u2019s got 19 kids. She\u2019s not stressed,\u201d Disick says, to which the icon herself Kris Jenner jokingly adds, \u201cYeah, I want to kill myself.\u201d\n\nEven with four kids, Kardashian hasn\u2019t been pushed to the brink. She recently gushed about baby Pslam on social media. \u201cMy little man is the sweetest ever!\u201d she said on Instagram. \u201cHe\u2019s honestly the best baby. Sleeps through the night and by far my most calm. How did I get so lucky.\u201d", "description": "\"That's why I don't drink,\" the reality TV star said.", "authors": ["Entertainment Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6ffeb82500007e0403608e.jpeg?cache=kzfawrblis&ops=1778_1000"}
