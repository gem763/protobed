Total said in a statement that the acquisition will cost about $600 million taking into account its divestment in another Indian LNG terminal earlier this year.\n\nThe deal will give Total access to India\u2019s market and support its drive to become one of the world\u2019s top LNG players. India\u2019s annual LNG demand will hit 28 million tons by 2023, making it the world\u2019s fourth largest importer of the fuel, according to BloombergNEF.\n\n\u201cThe market in India will have a strong growth and is an attractive outlet for the world\u2019s second-largest LNG player that Total has become,\u201d Total Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne said in the statement.\n\nThe acquisition is the latest in a string of Total investments meant to beef up its presence in LNG. The French giant agreed to take over the Mozambique LNG project earlier this year as part of a deal for Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE: ).\u2019s assets in Africa. The company has also recently absorbed Engie SA\u2019s upstream assets, boosted its investment in Tellurian Inc. and its U.S.-based Driftwood LNG venture, and is planning to sanction a new gas export project in Papua New Guinea.\n\nAdani is developing the Mundra and Dhamra LNG import terminals in India. It plans to expand its distribution network in the next decade to about 6 million homes and 1,500 retail outlets for vehicles.\n\nTotal will make the purchase through a tender offer to public shareholders for up to 25.2% and the residual shares from Adani family, Adani Gas said in a statement to stock exchanges. Times of India reported in June that Total was close to buying a 30% stake in Adani for over $800 million.\n\n(Updates with details on India\u2019s LNG market in fifth paragraph.)", "description": "Total Makes $600 Million Bet on India Gas With Adani Stake", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic3eac42ec18d7ebc3fb2aedda6c8cc11c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
