I look forward to observing those jumpers in the wild.'\n\nAn anonymous woman, from the UK, shared a photo of FatFace's Felicity Fairisle Jumper (pictured) on Mumsnet, and pointed out the rather amusing design fail\n\nThe \u00a356 garment has caused quite a stir online, with many joking the bunting feature looks remarkably similar to a row of breasts\n\nTaking to the comments section, one social media user enthused: 'Oh Lordy...I thought you were exaggerating. Once seen, you cannot unsee' (pictured)\n\nA third added: 'No wonder the model is biting her fingers,' while a further wrote: '\u00a356 for a mainly plastic boob jumper? Amazed they\u2019re not flying off the shelves!'\n\nAnd it wasn't long before others jumped on the bandwagon and revealed they were left in hysterics by the unfortunate blunder.\n\n'This made me chuckle,' enthused one, while a second added: 'That made me properly laugh.'\n\nAnother joked: 'I wouldn't even buy it in a charity shop a pound, as the boobs are droopy,and not perky,' while a further simply added: 'It is TERRIBLE isn't it? How did they not notice?'\n\nMany admitted that the rather rude blunder made them 'properly laugh' and 'chuckle' - and joked they couldn't 'unsee' it\n\nMeanwhile, a few innocent-minded shoppers admitted they failed to see an issue with the item - until they read all of the comments.\n\n'I looked at it and thought \"What's wrong with that... oh\" as my eyes moved down,' wrote one, while a further commented: 'Quick look seems OK oh no no no it really doesn't what t** designed this?'\n\nHowever, the amusing design faux pas wasn't enough to stop some fans of the brand from getting into the festive spirit.\n\n'Oh I usually love Fatface fairisle jumpers,' defended one. 'I'd still wear it,' while another admitted: 'I don't see anything but a jumper.'", "description": "An anonymous woman, from the UK, took to Mumsnet to share a rude design on a FatFace jumper.
