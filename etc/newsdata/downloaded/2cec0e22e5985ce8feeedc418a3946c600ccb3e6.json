One is a three-pronged requirement, called an \u201cABC test,\u201d stating the following:\n\n\u201cA person providing labor or services for remuneration shall be considered an employee rather than an independent contractor unless the hiring entity demonstrates that the person is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity in connection with the performance of the work, the person performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and the person is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation or business.\u201d\n\nThe other is an enforcement mechanism that gives the state Attorney General power to sue over claims that drivers are misclassified as independent contractors.\n\nProtestors march through the financial district, demanding fair wages and more transparency during a strike against Uber in San Francisco, California, U.S., May 8, 2019.

In addition, McRay is asking the court for an injunction that would order Uber to classify its drivers as employees.\n\nThe filing comes as the new bill, Assembly Bill 5, awaits Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s signature, and as Uber and a coalition of companies, including Lyft, DoorDash, and Postmates, try to create carve-outs that would spare the companies the version of the bill, as it stands. Claims in the lawsuit allege violations of a California Supreme Court ruling on which the new law is based.\n\nDara Khosrowshahi, CEO of Uber Technologies Inc., attends the annual Allen and Co. Sun Valley media conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, U.S., July 11, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid More\n\n\u201cIndeed, the California legislature has now passed a statute known as Assembly Bill 5, which codifies the 2018 California Supreme Court decision\u2026,\u201d the complaint states, \u201cunder which an alleged employer cannot justify classifying workers as independent contractors who perform services within its usual course of business.\u201d\n\nA decision Wednesday from the Third Circuit Court of Appeals could make enforcing mandatory arbitration agreements increasingly difficult. The court opened the door to allow an Uber driver to argue that his work is considered engagement in interstate commerce, which in turn, would permit him to bring a claim in court to argue that the company had misclassified him as an independent contractor.\n\n\u2018Drivers will not automatically be reclassified\u2019\n\nFor Uber\u2019s part, the company says, despite the law, it plans to continue treating drivers as independent contractors, and may have success challenging the argument that drivers are part of the usual course of its business. Uber\u2019s chief legal officer Tony West said during a conference call with reporters before the lawsuit was filed on Wednesday that Uber had been successful in arguing under the ABC test in the past that drivers are independent contractors.\n\nStory continues", "description": "An Uber driver in California is wasting no time seizing upon a new law passed by the state legislature Wednesday that could reclassify ride-hailing drivers from independent contractors to employees.", "authors": ["Alexis Keenan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bHHaJENdo4ktNNkfRXxgfw--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-07/1753be20-af1c-11e9-9eea-090fade5ec02", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
