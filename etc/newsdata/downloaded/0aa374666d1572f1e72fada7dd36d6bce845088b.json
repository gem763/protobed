(Tom Saater/For The Washington Post)\n\nFour hundred nights. Fatima counted each one as she lay on the ground with her toddler, crammed between strangers, swatting away mosquitoes in a room that stank of feces. She remembers thinking: Why did I escape the terrorists for this?\n\n\u201cBoko Haram treated us better,\u201d she said, tears sliding down her cheeks.\n\nFatima, now 18, is among thousands of children detained in recent years by Nigerian armed forces \u2014 including many who had fled extremist captors \u2014 amid a decade-long conflict that often turns victims into suspects.\n\nDefense officials deny claims of abusive confinement and say they must vet everyone who emerges from the restive countryside: Boko Haram and other Islamist groups in Nigeria\u2019s northeast are known for sending children to carry out attacks. But human rights advocates say conditions in the holding centers are so appalling they thwart the military\u2019s goal of protecting \u2014 and deradicalizing \u2014 young people by breeding resentment of the government.\n\nIn interviews with The Washington Post, seven children who spent time in the Giwa barracks near the city of Maiduguri, as well as other military facilities, said they were allowed no outside contact. None of the seven, now ages 10 to 18, met with lawyers. The Washington Post is using only their nicknames because they fear reprisals.\n\nOne young man said soldiers beat him. One girl said a guard tried to rape her. All described an environment where they slept beside strangers on mats, were separated from family members by gender and saw people die of illness.\n\nA new report from Human Rights Watch corroborates their accounts. Researchers said they met in June with 32 children and young adults who reported being packed into hot rooms without bedding or mosquito nets in a region where malaria is a top cause of death. They described an overwhelming stench coming from an open toilet, the authors wrote, and sometimes fainted in the heat.\n\nThe military called the report false.\n\n\u201cApprehended children are kept in secured places, where they are adequately fed, profiled and de-radicalized before their release,\u201d Col. Onyema Nwachukwu, acting director of defense information, said in a public statement. \u201cThe children are provided with regular feeding, clothing, requisite medical attention, in-house spiritual and educational tutoring and other welfare needs.\u201d\n\n\n\nResidents cross a pedestrian bridge, which bears a sign of Malala Yousafzai, an activist for human rights and a symbol of hope, in Maiduguri, Nigeria on Sept. 5. (Tom Saater/For The Washington Post)\n\nNigerian forces have released at least 2,200 children \u2014 nearly all without charges \u2014 since 2013 and treated them \u201cas victims of war and not as suspects,\u201d Nwachukwu said in his statement. He did not respond to The Post\u2019s request for an interview.\n\nThe United Nations says more than 3,600 children have been held in military facilities during that period.\n\nOver the past 10 years, Boko Haram, one of several extremist groups seeking to build an Islamist state in West Africa, has killed approximately 27,000 people.\n\nThe Nigerian military and international partners have shrunk the terrorists\u2019 footprint in recent years, but the group continues to launch devastating attacks from its remote outposts in the northeastern state of Borno. The terrorists often strap children with explosives and force them into crowds. Eight suicide bombers have struck Maiduguri, the state capital, since January.\n\n[Suspected Boko Haram fighters kill 65 in attack on funeral in Nigeria]\n\nSome in Nigeria fear the military\u2019s vetting strategy could keep those who have run from violence in hiding. The conflict has displaced more than 2 million people, and at least 22,000 remain missing, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross. About half were younger than 18 when they disappeared.\n\nAhmed Abdullahi, 64, said his two teenage sons dashed into the forest when Boko Haram ambushed their village in 2014.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t be willing to come out,\u201d Abdullahi said. \u201cThey could be targeted by Boko Haram or by the military.\u201d\n\n\n\nAhmed Abdullahi and wife, Hauwa Abdullahi, were separated from their children in 2014 when Boko Haram fighters attacked their settlement in Gwoza. Their two sons ran to hide in the forest and they were never seen again. (Tom Saater/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe allegations about the Giwa barracks come as the United States grapples with its own child-detention controversy \u2014 the Trump administration unveiled a regulation last month that would allow federal agents to indefinitely hold minors who try to cross the border. Reports have surfaced in Texas of children being forced to sleep on concrete floors with aluminum blankets, among other complaints.\n\nFatima said she spent 15 months in military custody before being released to a camp in Maiduguri for displaced people last summer.\n\nShe remembers walking to her older sister\u2019s village in 2014 when men with machine guns blocked the dirt path. They beat her, burned her face with the barrels of their AK-47s and later forced her to marry a fighter. She gave birth to a baby boy.\n\nFatima was 16 when she finally escaped the Boko Haram camp, running barefoot with her son wrapped in cloth on her back. Adrenaline and chance carried her to a group of Nigerian soldiers.\n\n\u201cThen I was in another kind of prison,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery day I prayed to leave.\u201d\n\nGoggo, 14, said her ordeal began about four years ago when Boko Haram militants attacked her village. Soldiers found her hiding in the bush with her family. They accused her father and brother of being Boko Haram members and beat them, she said.\n\nThat was the last time she saw them.\n\nGoggo said she spent two years in the women\u2019s side of Giwa. Two hundred people were kept in one big room, she said. The smell made her feel sick. She had trouble eating.\n\n\u201cI could see maggots crawling in my soup,\u201d she said.\n\nOne day, she said, a guard pulled her into another room and told her he wanted to make love to her. She screamed. Other soldiers ran in and stopped him.\n\nGmarley, 15, lost touch with his family after gunmen stormed his village five years ago. They ran one way. He bolted another.\n\nBoko Haram fighters caught the 10-year-old and gave him a choice: Join us or die.\n\nHe spent three months with the terrorists, learning how to make bombs. Then the military charged the camp. Gmarley escaped in the chaos.\n\nHe walked all night back to his home village, where soldiers apprehended him.\n\n\u201cThey pointed their guns at me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey kept saying, \u2018Your parents are Boko Haram.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nAhmed Abdullahi shows pictures of his two sons who have been missing since 2014 when Boko Haram fighters attacked their settlement in Gwoza. (Tom Saater/For The Washington Post)\n\nMallam, 18, wanted to be a fisherman. He left his village at age 12 with some friends to catch tilapia in a nearby river.\n\nThat is when insurgents sprang out and surrounded them. \u201cAll those with able bodies,\u201d he recalls them saying, \u201cmust join us or be killed.\u201d\n\nThe Boko Haram fighters walked the boys deep into the forest. For months, they tried to brainwash them: Everything Western is evil. Destroying the enemy is God\u2019s work.\n\nThen they led them to a Boko Haram camp and armed them with AK-47s.\n\nMallam said he was forced to attack military outposts. He said he closed his eyes and fired at random.\n\nIf he shot at the ground, he said, he would look suspicious. If he returned with a bullet left in the chamber, they would kill him.\n\nThis pattern continued for five years before he plotted with a friend to escape. They waited for the guards to fall asleep and slipped away in the darkness, running to the first military bunker they could find.\n\nThe soldiers, he said, beat them with their guns and tied them up. They were ordered to kneel for two days.\n\nHe is not sure how long the military kept him.\n\n\u201cI had already made up my mind for the worst,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they should free me, fine. If they should kill me, fine.\u201d\n\nIsmail Alfa contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\n\u2018A famine unlike any we have ever seen\u2019: As Nigeria battles Islamist terrorists, millions are at risk of starvation\n\nWhy Shiite Muslim protesters and Nigeria\u2019s security forces keep clashing\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "A Human Rights Watch report describes appalling conditions in screening centers; the military rejects the allegations.", "authors": ["Danielle Paquette", "West Africa Bureau Chief", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/USRxePGkYQyE0qPLZN0zjbpKKE8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7IRAB4WXAUI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
