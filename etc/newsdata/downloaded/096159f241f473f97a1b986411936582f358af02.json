The passengers staged mass protests before the ship docked in Southampton. In response, the cruise line offered a 25 percent credit toward a future trip. But we're told more than 1,000 people are now planning to sue the company.\n\nPassengers leaving the Norwegian Spirit cruise ship Friday were quick to share their anger, reports CBS News correspondent Mola Lenghi.\n\n\n\n\"There's a lot of people that are saying never again,\" one passenger said.\n\n\"Yeah, we feel like we've been scammed,\" another said.\n\nThe cruise left from the same port in England on Sept. 27. Passengers paid prices starting around $1,200 for a 14-day trip that was supposed to include stops in Holland, Norway, Iceland and Ireland.\n\n\n\n\"We don't want to be on the ship! We want off the ship!\" angry passengers yelled.\n\nBut problems mounted quickly. After what Norwegian called \"severe weather conditions,\" the ship canceled several planned destinations \u2013 within the guidelines of its guest contract \u2013 leaving irate passengers stuck on board for days.\n\n\n\n\"The toilet just does not flush,\" a passenger said.\n\nKatasha Jones and her boyfriend left the cruise early amid additional concerns over broken plumbing. She said the hallways smelled like sewage, and Norwegian's response left a bad taste.\n\n\n\n\"A refund would be nice but\u2026 a discount to spend more money with them is really just not going to cut it for people,\" Jones said.\n\n", "description": "The Norwegian Spirit passengers staged mass protests before the ship docked in Southampton, England", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/11/f33864fa-a82f-48ad-8061-72804e927ad8/thumbnail/1200x630/79eaf0f717336eb2fd2a2486fd6cb858/ctm-1011-norwegian-cruise-protest.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
