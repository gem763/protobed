The purpose is to try to persuade them to underwrite the purchase of the stricken Lehman Brothers by Bank of America.\n\nIt\u2019s a dramatic episode. More so, when away from the table, Bank of America is then approached by a troubled Merrill Lynch, and Bank of America agrees to buy it instead. That leaves the British bank, Barclays, as the only possible saviour for Lehman, and it\u2019s blocked by the UK regulators.\n\nThe picture reeks of power \u2013 failing clout maybe, but nevertheless the testosterone flies off the screen. Not least, because you realise that every single person involved, in camera, sitting in the chairs and also on the phone, at Bank of America, Merrill, Lehman, Barclays and the authorities, is a man.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAfter the crash, the Labour politician Harriet Harman remarked of the amount of turmoil, \u201cSomebody did say ... that if it had been Lehman Sisters, rather than Lehman Brothers, then there may not have been as much.\u201d\n\nContinued Harman: \u201cI do seriously think half the financial services industry is women now. Women make up half the workforce of insurance companies and banks. Why shouldn\u2019t they have a say on boards as well?\u201d\n\nAt last \u2013 11 years after the near-total meltdown and hundreds of years of banking history \u2013 a female has broken through the glass ceiling of major British banks, and by extension the City, and British business. One of the \u201cbig four\u201d British banks of RBS, Lloyds, Barclays, and HSBC has a woman at its head.\n\nThere have been other female chiefs in British banking \u2013 Ana Botin at Santander and Dame Jayne-Anne Gadhia at Virgin Money, the purchaser of Northern Rock, as well as Inga Beale at insurer Lloyd\u2019s of London and Clara Furse at the London Stock Exchange, but Alison Rose\u2019s appointment to run RBS is the most significant leap.\n\nShe is the first woman to head a genuinely big time, all-singing, all-dancing British bank; not just a lesser player or one that specialises in retail banking, but an organisation that, while it\u2019s not what it was compared to the heady days pre-crash when Fred Goodwin was in charge, counts as a financial powerhouse. Rose tops 67,000 employees and oversees an asset base of \u00a3694bn and leading brands such as NatWest and Coutts. Her bank is the largest provider of banking, finance and risk management services to UK corporate and commercial customers.\n\nThen I remembered the lunch I\u2019d enjoyed at Lehman, shortly before it went under, when the men present were mocking the calamity at Northern Rock, also run by a fella\n\nThe elevation of Rose, married with two children, and with 27 years of service behind her at RBS, is a landmark. I\u2019ve wined and dined at all the large bank headquarters in my time, and not once have I been hosted by a woman. On the way to the hospitality suite, you\u2019re usually taken down a corridor adorned with portraits of current and former bosses. Every single one of them has always been male.\n\nNowhere was that masculinity more evident than at RBS during Goodwin\u2019s day. He wasn\u2019t a muscly, heavyweight of a bloke \u2013 more fly-half than prop forward \u2013 but he oozed the male traits of aggression and competitiveness. Goodwin would positively bristle when a rival was mentioned, his flinty eyes inevitably narrowing and his lip curling. He couldn\u2019t help himself. It was the culture in which he\u2019d been brought up, in which he\u2019d risen up. A macho, kill and take no prisoners, culture.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Here we go again, I thought, the sisters making a claim that was naive and out-of-touch. The banks\u2019 failure, I reasoned, had nothing to do with the gender of those in charge. But then I remembered the lunch I\u2019d enjoyed at Lehman, shortly before it went under, when the men present \u2013 only men \u2013 were mocking the calamity at Northern Rock, also run by a fella.\n\nAnd I recalled Goodwin, and how he\u2019d set RBS on a course to disaster by steering it to acquire ABN-Amro, partly because, it was always said, he could not bear the thought of Barclays taking over the Dutch bank. ABN-Amro was a terrible buy, with RBS paying well over the odds. It led to RBS having to be rescued by the British government, and caused the toppling of Goodwin.\n\nWould a woman have done the same? Would Rose, if was up to her, as it could be in the years to come, embark on something similar? I doubt it.\n\nRecalling 2008, and the death of Lehman, and remembering that subsequent film, with all the men outstaring each other, and refusing to show any sign of warmth lest it be interpreted as weakness, it\u2019s difficult to argue Harman\u2019s madness. She may well have had a point.\n\nIt\u2019s up to Rose now to show so. She takes over in a different banking climate, but make no mistake: hers is the most vital move of any by a woman in British business. Nowhere is more sexist than the top of British commerce (despite what the PRs claim), and within that, nowhere is more sexist than the City (despite what the PRs claim). It\u2019s been too long coming, but Rose\u2019s selection is the cause of much rejoicing.", "description": "There is a scene in the compelling film\u00a0Too Big To Fail, documenting the banking collapse of 2008, in which the US treasury secretary Hank Paulson, together with the president of the Federal Reserve, Timothy\u00a0Geithner, gathers the heads of the biggest US banks, including Goldman Sachs\u2019 Lloyd\u00a0Blankfein, JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie\u00a0Dimon, and Morgan Stanley chief John Mack.
