Jesus? It\u2019s me. Photo: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images\n\nThe second coming is here! Sorry, false alarm. It\u2019s just Gwendoline Christie floating across the 2019 Emmys red carpet. The Game of Thrones star spent ages waiting, hair in a bun, and stealing scenes only to be industry-crucified by HBO not submitting her for Outstanding Supporting Actress. So, instead, she submitted herself and Ser Brienne of Tarth showed up wearing a winner\u2019s look: the uniform of Jesus Christ of Nazareth himself. Plus, flowy locks. So, perhaps she has the most important Emmys voter is on her side. The look channels JC, it channels Game of Thrones, the show where Christie proved herself to be a queen as the first female knight, and it has to be the most comfortable Emmys look on the purple carpet. Soft silk, baggy silhouette? That\u2019s what we\u2019d like to be buried in (and then resurrected in three days later, thank you very much.)", "description": "Gwendoline Christie (Brienne of Tarth on \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019) looks like Jesus Christ on the Emmys 2019 red carpet.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/galleries/events/2019/emmys/batch-4/GettyImages-1176430118.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
