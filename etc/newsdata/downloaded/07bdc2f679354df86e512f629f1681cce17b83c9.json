May this autumn's sorghum harvest be bountiful! We good now, China?'\n\nAn episode of South Park titled 'Band in China,' which pokes fun at American companies who bow to strict Chinese censorship laws, resulted in the Comedy Central show being scrubbed from the internet in China\n\nIn the plot from the episode last Wednesday, Randy (right) gets arrested carrying marijuana into China, frustrating his plans to sell weed\n\nHe is then sent to a work camp, where he sees Winnie the Pooh and Piglet, who are imprisoned because the bear was used to mock Chinese President Xi Jinping\n\nThe episode highlights the harsh conditions of the prison camp where Randy is held\n\nParker and Stone reference the NBA, which is struggling to contain the fallout from Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey's recent tweet in support of pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong - a statement some Chinese NBA fans found offensive.\n\nThe Comedy Central show, which is in the midst of its 23rd season, aired an episode on Wednesday titled 'Band in China'.\n\nThe show features Randy traveling to China to expand his marijuana distributing business.\n\nRandy flies to China thinking he is the first businessman to seek to grow his sales by branching out internationally.\n\nSouth Park creators Matt Stone (left) and Trey Parker (right) mocked China after it was learned censors had banned the show from all internet platforms\n\n'Like the NBA , we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts,' the show's creators wrote in a statement posted on Twitter\n\nOn the plane, however, he runs into a number of American businessmen, including tech figures and even NBA players, who are also headed to China.\n\nRandy is also disappointed to find that a number of Disney characters were on the flight to China.\n\n'I can handle some healthy competition,' he says. 'Who else wants to go to China and get some of their money?'\n\nThis prompts a number of Disney characters, including the Beast from Beauty and the Beast, Captain America and Black Panther to enter the cabin and take their seats.\n\n'It's OK, it's OK... I'm sure there's plenty of Chinese people for all of us,' a frustrated Randy says.\n\nAfter arriving in the country, Randy is hauled off to a work camp for possession of marijuana.\n\nSouth Park's creators made mention of the NBA, which is trying to dig itself out of a controversy that was sparked by a tweet from Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey\n\nMorey apologized on Monday for the tweet he swiftly deleted over the weekend that included an image of the activists' rally cry: 'Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong'\n\nIn the camp, he meets Winnie the Pooh and Piglet, who were imprisoned because the bear was used to mock Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nWhile Randy languishes in a work camp, the gang at South Park decide to get together to form a metal band.\n\nA manager then decides he wants to make a movie about the band featuring Stan, Jimmy, Kenny, and Butters.\n\nBut in order to get the film distributed in China, the manager orders numerous changes to the script.\n\n'Now I know how Hollywood writers feel,' Stan says as Chinese guard watches over him and orders edits while he writes the script.\n\nThe episode takes a number of veiled shots at Disney. In one sequence, Mickey Mouse makes sure that cartoon characters from Disney and Disney-owned Marvel fall in line with China's edicts.\n\nThe episode ends when Stan leaves the metal band, insisting that he won't agree to Chinese censorship.\n\nIn response to the episode, Chinese streaming services and web sites removed any trace of South Park, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nEvery episode, clip, and reference to the show has been removed from Chinese web pages, social media sites, discussion groups, message boards, and even fan pages.\n\nWeibo, China's Twitter-like social media platform, has removed all mention of South Park even though the show has been the subject of billions of posts.\n\nRockets star James Harden (above) on Monday apologized to China as the team and the NBA were forced into defensive mode when China's state broadcaster yanked Rockets games from the air and sponsors abandoned them\n\nBaidu, which is China's largest online discussions platform, has scrubbed all threats and sub-threads mentioning South Park.\n\nThe latest controversy involving a popular American brand comes as the NBA's Houston Rockets are grappling with their own problems with China sparked by General Manager Daryl Morey's tweet in support of Hong Kong protesters.\n\nMorey apologized on Monday for a tweet in support of Hong Kong protests, saying he did not intend to offend fans of the NBA team in China.\n\n'I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation on a complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives,' Morey said in a tweet.\n\nTHE NBA'S STATEMENT ON MOREY'S TWEET 'We recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable. 'While Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals' educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them. 'We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together.'\n\n'I have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention,' he said, adding that his tweets did not represent the Rockets or NBA.\n\nThe team's Chinese sponsor and a Chinese sportswear maker suspended work with the Rockets after Morey's tweet over the weekend.\n\nMorey quickly deleted the tweet, which included an image captioned: 'Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.'\n\nIn recent months, masses of demonstrators have taken to the streets in Hong Kong to protest a proposed bill that would allow for the extradition of suspected criminals to mainland China.\n\nDemonstrators see the bill, which has since been withdrawn, as a worrying sign of China's attempts to intervene in Hong Kong's affairs.\n\nHong Kong is a semi-autonomous region that has special administrative status in China after the British handed back the territory in 1997.\n\nIn a separate statement, the NBA said it recognized Morey's views have 'deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.'\n\nThe NBA's statement generated harsh backlash in the United States, with fans slamming the league for its perceived kowtowing to the Chinese government.\n\nSeeking to mend the rift, Rockets star James Harden tried to defuse the controversy by issuing his own apology to China.\n\n'We apologize. You know, we love China. We love playing there,' Harden said as his team prepared for an exhibition game in Tokyo on Monday.\n\n'For both of us individually, we go there once or twice a year. They show us the most important love.'", "description": "Trey Parker and Matt Stone issued a tongue-in-cheek 'apology' to 'the Great Communist Party of China' after Chinese censors scrubbed South Park from the internet in response to an episode.", "authors": ["Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/20/19411798-0-image-a-12_1570478374153.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
