It was submitted for the 2020 Grammys in categories like song and record of the year \u2014 where songwriters and producers also earn nominations; the Recording Academy will announce its nominees on Nov. 20.\n\n\u201cThe last thing we want to do is throw any negativity toward Lizzo\u2019s momentum and movement as a cultural figure. If we believe in what she\u2019s preaching, believing in ourselves & our own voices is something we thought she\u2019d understand,\u201d Justin Raisen wrote.\n\nLizzo is currently selling T-shirts on her website that read \u201c100% that bitch \u201d \u2014 the line created by Lioness (She didn\u2019t immediately reply to an email from The Associated Press seeking comment).\n\n\u201cIf Ricky and Lizzo\u2019s team decide to settle this dispute with us, we would like to share some of the proceeds with Mina for her influence on Healthy,\u201d Justin Raisen wrote.", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 There's a debate about the truth behind Lizzo's \"Truth Hurts.\" Lizzo's breakthrough tune, which spent six weeks on top of Billboard's Hot", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/16/f1bcec_2019-austin-city-limits-music-festival-weekend-day-30332-lizzo-lizzo-performs-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
