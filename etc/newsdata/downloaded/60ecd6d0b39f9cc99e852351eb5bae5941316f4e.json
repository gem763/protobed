The event was part of a conference put on by Weatherford, a major oilfield services provider, and was billed as \u201cthe U.S. oil and gas industry\u2019s only Production 4.0 forum.\u201d Per Weatherford, its aim was \u201cto discuss the role of digitalization in the near and long-term future of oil and gas production.\u201d\n\nAccording to Offshore Engineer Magazine, Amazon Web Services has \u2014 along with Microsoft and IBM \u2014 partnered with Weatherford to help build its suite of Production 4.0 technologies. As the conference title indicates, these technologies are explicitly intended to accelerate and improve oil production. AWS was a Platinum sponsor of the event.\n\n\u201cWeatherford Production 4.0 products \u2026 activate field-wide intelligence to maximise production,\u201d Manoj Nimbalkar, Weatherford Global Vice President, Production Automation and Software, said in a press release. \u201cWeatherford delivers the future of production performance through next-generation automation, IoT infrastructure and advanced optimisation software to boost production, uptime and efficiency.\u201d\n\nBoosting production will also boost the amount of heat-trapping carbon dioxide that is released into the atmosphere at a time that scientists say that most fossil fuels must be left in the ground if we are to avoid catastrophic climate change.\n\nIn no uncertain terms, accelerating oil production will accelerate the advance of the climate crisis.\n\nWeatherford hosts energy visionaries from @amazon & @Microsoft and Production 4.0-driven oilfield operators from @ApacheCorp & Targa Resources to discuss digitalization in oil and gas production. This is the industry\u2019s only Production 4.0 forum in the US. https://t.co/rFEPUd7QsI pic.twitter.com/LV3XGc5rjF \u2014 Weatherford (@WeatherfordCorp) October 7, 2019\n\nAmazon won headlines around the globe when CEO Jeff Bezos announced the company\u2019s ambitious-sounding \u2018Climate Pledge.\u2019 This, Bezos said, set the online retailer on a path to 100 per cent clean energy and carbon neutral shipping. The pledge was largely seen as a response to Amazon employees\u2019 continued agitation for their company to adopt a plan to address the climate crisis.\n\nYet the details and specifics of the roadmap to sustainability were scarce, and when a reporter asked Bezos if he would be cancelling his company\u2019s contracts with the oil and gas industry, his response was simple: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to work hard for energy companies,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd our view is we\u2019re going to work very hard to make sure that as they transition they have the best tools possible.\u201d\n\nBezos is certainly making good on his word.\n\nCorporations typically host a presence at trade conferences like this to advertise their services and network with prospective clients in hopes of attracting new business. By sponsoring this event, and by sending David Milam, AWS\u2019s Head of Oil & Gas Solutions, to give a keynote talk \u2014 mere weeks after Amazon made a highly publicized pledge to reduce carbon emissions and embrace clean energy, no less \u2014 the company is sending a clear signal that it will remain wide open to the business of advancing and technologically improving fossil fuel production.\n\nIt is quite literally underwriting \u201cAccelerating Oil Production 4.0.\u201d\n\nAmazon may say it is dedicated to being a part of the solution to climate change \u2014 and it may yet make good on its commitments to power its own operations with clean energy and reduce its shipping emissions. But by simultaneously helping oil and gas companies develop new technologies to automate, streamline, and accelerate the extraction of fossil fuels, Amazon is undermining both its own claims to sincerity and any net carbon reductions it might make.\n\nWorse, by helping to keep oil cheaper and more plentiful, Amazon and other tech companies assisting in oil extraction are delaying the transition they claim to want to help advance. If Amazon is serious about its climate pledge, it needs to be in the business of decelerating fossil fuel production, not the opposite.\n\nAmazon did not respond to a request for comment, and Weatherford declined to do so.", "description": "Just two weeks after Amazon pledged to radically reduce its company-wide carbon emissions, the head of its oil and gas web services subsidiary travelled to Houston, Texas, to participate in the oil industry\u2019s \u201cAccelerate Production 4.0\u201d event.
