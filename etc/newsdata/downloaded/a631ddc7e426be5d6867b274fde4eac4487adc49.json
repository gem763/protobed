Also, it was executed by President George W. Bush and supported by Biden.\n\nBiden later claimed he was immediately against the Iraq War after voting to authorize it in 2002, but FactCheck.org showed that it was three years before he began opposing it.\n\nWhile he was vice president in 2011, the Obama administration also withdrew all U.S. forces from Iraq, which created a vacuum for the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).\n\nThe Obama administration also did not support moderate Syrian protesters before the Syrian civil war began, which prompted some to turn to Islamist groups for help, fueling the civil war and ISIS\u2019s numbers in Syria.\n\nThe Syrian civil war has led to hundreds of thousands of Syrians killed, about eight million Syrians displaced from their homes, a refugee crisis, and terrorist attacks in Europe.\n\nDespite this, Biden touted his foreign policy record, stating that \u201cour commanders across the board, former and present, are ashamed.\u201d Actually, only retired commanders \u2014 some of whom worked for the Obama administration \u2014 have expressed shame.\n\nHe said, \u201cAnd the fact of the matter is, I\u2019ve never seen a time \u2014 and I\u2019ve spent thousands of hours in the Situation Room, I\u2019ve spent many hours on the ground in those very places, in Syria and in Iraq, and guess what? Our commanders across the board, former and present, are ashamed of what\u2019s happening here.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, he stated that he would make it clear to Assad that \u201che\u2019s going to have a problem\u201d with Turkey and tell Turkey it will pay a \u201cheavy price\u201d for invading Syria. (Trump has already threatened to tank Turkey\u2019s economy and imposed sanctions.)\n\nBiden also said he would want U.S. troops to be protected by air cover (which they are as they withdraw from Syria) but said he would \u201cmake it clear that they\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would want those thousand troops to be protected by air cover, those thousand troops that are being \u2014 having to withdraw under fire, make it clear that they\u2019re not going anywhere and have them protected and work my way back toward what, in fact, needs to be done, protecting those Kurds. They lost their lives. This is shameful, shameful what this man has done,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019 @Kristina_Wong.", "description": "Joe Biden claimed Wednesday night during the fourth Democrat debate that U.S. troops in \"Iraq\" are \"being fired on\" by Syrian regime forces.", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Joe-Biden-pointing-debate-October-15-2019-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
