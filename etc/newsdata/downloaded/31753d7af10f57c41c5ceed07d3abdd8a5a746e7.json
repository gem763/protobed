On April 5, 1999, he performed a stunt where he was buried in a coffin for seven days underneath a three-ton water-filled tank with only liquids to sustain himself. Blaine is pictured in the coffin\n\nThe first of his accusers filed a sexual assault claim in 2018, and a second woman came forward this year.\n\nOne of the women told law enforcement that in 1997, Blaine hypnotized her into performing a sex act on him at his Manhattan apartment.\n\nThe other woman says Blaine sexually assaulted her in his apartment on New Year\u2019s Day, 1998, which may fall outside the statute of limitations, leaving it unclear how the NYPD is approaching their investigation.\n\nA few sexual assault offenses in New York carry no time limit for criminal prosecution, like rape in the first degree, after lawmakers overturned the statute in 2006.\n\nBut acts some, like forcible touching and rape in the third degree, must be prosecuted within 2-5 years from the time of the alleged act, or from the time the alleged victim turned 18.\n\nAmong other things, the difference between rape in the first degree and rape in the third degree in the state of New York is whether the alleged perpetrator used physical force or the threat of immediate death, physical injury or kidnapping, and potentially the age of the victim.\n\nIn a statement in April, the NYPD said it \u2018takes sexual assault and rape cases extremely seriously, and urges anyone who has been a victim to file a report so we can perform a comprehensive investigation, and offer support and services to survivors'.\n\nBlaine was accused of raping former model Natasha Prince (pictured) in 2004 in London in 2016. He was questioned by detectives with Scotland Yard but not prosecuted\n\nThe incident involving Prince allegedly occurred shortly after Blaine's suspension stunt in London, where he sealed himself inside a transparent, plexiglass case for 44 days, hanging 30 feet in the air on the bank of the River Thames. Blaine is pictured in the plexiglass case\n\nThis is not the first time Blaine has been accused of sexual assault. Former model Natasha Prince alleged Blaine raped her in London in 2004, which the magician denied.\n\nPrince alleged that Blaine drugged and anally raped her at a private home in the Chelsea area of London in the summer of that year.\n\nBlaine was questioned in 2017 but Scotland Yard detectives later declined to take further action after investigating her claim.\n\nBlaine is known for stunts like being buried underground for seven days without food or water in New York in 1999.\n\nHe also stayed in a plexiglass case suspended 30ft above the Thames River in London for more than 40 days in 2003.", "description": "The celebrity magician appeared in a somber mood before stepping inside the exclusive event in NYC, dressed modestly in a blue shirt, dark pants and sneakers, with a black baseball cap on.", "authors": ["Luke Kenton For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/18/19660738-0-image-a-21_1570989538977.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
