In the past two years, the company struggled with waste and quality control at its giant battery plant, the Gigafactory, outside of Reno, Nevada.\n\nRepresentatives from Tesla were not immediately available for comment.\n\nIn 2016, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that he believed most safety complaints filed to NHTSA were \"fraudulent\" and suggested such complaints were part of a broad conspiracy to thwart his electric vehicle company.\n\nTesla's new Smart Summon feature (which allows drivers to bring a car out of a parking spot to where they are standing without a driver behind the wheel) also caught the attention of NHTSA this week. The agency said it became aware of some reports of accidents involving Smart Summon but declined to confirm whether it has launched a formal investigation into Smart Summon.\n\nHere's the full petition:", "description": "Tesla is facing new scrutiny from a federal auto safety agency around battery issues in some Model S and Model X vehicles.", "authors": ["Lora Kolodny Annie Palmer", "Lora Kolodny", "Annie Palmer"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105926045-1559662919891gettyimages-1149766443r.jpg?v=1570197170", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
