It ties the prime minister\u2019s hands about the date of the election. It sets it in law, so it doesn\u2019t give him the wriggle room that his plan would have.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard from behind the scenes, but I have written to him this morning, so I will hope to get a response this morning.\u201d\n\nWhen the idea for the bill-based election was first revealed on Sunday, Johnson\u2019s ministers dismissed it as a \u201cgimmick\u201d. However, Downing Street soon indicated it could adopt the plan if its FTPA-based election bid failed.\n\nHowever, agreement seems some way off amid mutual mistrust over issues such as the fact that a bill could be amended.\n\nAsked about the idea on Monday, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, refused to be drawn, calling the government motion the \u201cquickest and easiest and safest route\u201d to an election. He told Sky: \u201cWhat the prime minister is determined to do is get this vote through tonight.\u201d\n\nBut Williamson said he believed MPs were getting behind an election: \u201cThey are moving to recognition that this parliament isn\u2019t going to deliver anything. It doesn\u2019t want no deal. It doesn\u2019t want a deal. It seems to not want an election. That\u2019s not sustainable.\u201d\n\nThe schools minister, Nick Gibb, told the Today programme Swinson sought an election in order to \u201cdisobey\u201d the mandate given in the EU referendum. \u201cThey want to revoke article 50 and keep us in the EU,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Lib Dem/SNP plan also opens a divide with Labour, which has said it can only back an election if Johnson categorically rules out no deal, both at the end of January and if no permanent trade deal is in place by December 2020.\n\nIn seeking an election the Lib Dems have given up on their preference for a second referendum. Swinson said Jeremy Corbyn had been \u201cmissing in action on Brexit\u201d, and that without Labour support in parliament a second referendum would not happen.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any guarantee that waiting is going to make the Labour party suddenly get a serious position on Brexit,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what waiting would do is risk no deal. Because if we waste this extension and we end up with that 31 January deadline looming, assuming it\u2019s granted today, and we haven\u2019t done anything with this time, then there\u2019s no guarantee the EU will extend again.\u201d\n\nSwinson told Today she believed this had helped the EU move towards agreeing a Brexit extension to 31 January.\n\nShe said: \u201cOne of their big concerns was that they offered an extension earlier this year, said \u2018don\u2019t waste the time\u2019, and then we had a Conservative leadership election and Boris Johnson mucked about not trying to get a deal, shutting down parliament, the very masterclass in timewasting. So understandably they had a degree of reluctance.\u201d", "description": "Party\u2019s leader predicts Boris Johnson will take suggested route if Brexit delay agreed", "authors": ["Peter Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4b9e8b04314a4c9978e6a4f852941053ab456a0/0_77_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=57956e3add5719744281c54fddfdb5f3", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
