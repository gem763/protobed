What you need to know and do if your hotel room has bedbugs", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Here are eight travel-ready products will protect you and your belongings from bedbugs. Wibbitz - Smarter Travel\n\nOne of the last things anyone wants to see after entering a hotel room is a creepy, crawly bedbug \u2014 or to wake up with bedbug bites.\n\nBedbugs are tiny insects approximately the size of an apple seed. Adult bedbugs are oval, reddish-brown and flat. Younger ones can be difficult to see because they're so small.\n\nAnd there's a reason they're called bedbugs: They like to lurk during the daytime where people sleep and feed on them at night (bed bugs feed on both human and animal blood). The insects can be found in a host of places from mattresses to bedding to cracks in furniture to under carpeting and more.\n\nBedbugs can be found worldwide, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and are not a reflection on the cleanliness of any accommodation (so, yes, even a five-star hotel can have bedbugs). They don't spread disease nor are they seen as dangerous, but allergic reactions to bites could require a doctor visit.\n\nThe bites look like mosquito or flea bites, with a swollen, red spot that could itch or hurt. They could present randomly as well as in a straight line. Some people might not have any adverse reaction to the bites, but others could see swelling.\n\nOne of the last things anyone wants to see after entering a hotel room is a creepy, crawly bedbug \u2014 or to wake up with bedbug bites.

You should also check out the furniture near the bed, cracks in night stands as well as behind picture frames, where bedbugs can hide.\n\n\"If you think your hotel bed has bedbugs, you can either check your bed yourself, looking for small blood spots or small blood smears on the sheets and strip the bed and check under the mattress seams or ask the manager to organize for the housekeeper to do it for you,\" Maureen Spencer, travel blogger, told USA TODAY. \"Take photos of any evidence you find and ask for a room change.\"\n\nThere's no federal bedbug law, but 21 states do have bedbug-related legislation, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, like ensuring hotels are maintaining cleanliness and that hotels must exterminate bedbugs before housing different guests.\n\nWhat should I do if I find bedbugs in my hotel room?\n\nStep one: Panic! (Just kidding.)\n\n\"The very first thing that you should do if you encounter bedbugs in your hotel room, or even if you have a suspicion that there might be bedbugs in your room, is to pack up your stuff and place it as far away from the bedbug-infested places as possible,\" Kristiana Kripena, digital and content marketing director for InsectCop.net, tells USA TODAY. You want to avoid the bugs coming with you to your own house, she says.\n\nYou should also obviously notify hotel staff, but do your best to stay calm.\n\n\"Remember \u2013 this is never going to be something that hotel staff wants to hear,\" Becca Siegel of travel blog and Instagram @halfhalftravel tells USA TODAY. \"Actually, it's the last thing they want to hear because it's going to affect everyone staying in the hotel, their staff, their efforts in eradicating bedbugs and also their ratings online. Try to remain calm and empathetic.\"\n\nAlso remember that what you think is a bedbug might not be one at all.\n\n\"I can\u2019t tell you the number of times that a guest just sees a bug near a bed or on a bed and makes an assumption,\" Victoria Agredo, a hospitality industry veteran, tells USA TODAY. \"An untrained eye checking a room for themselves really isn\u2019t that helpful. They may find something or they may create a panic over nothing.\"\n\nIf they are indeed bedbugs, make sure you ask to be moved to a different room (and not one next to the one where you stayed).\n\nJordan Bishop, founder of consumer watchdog and travel website Yore Oyster, recommends sealing your clothes and other belongings in plastic bags and running them through a hot laundry cycle ASAP.\n\nYou can also use a garbage bag, and place that in a freezer overnight to get rid of bedbugs. For non-washable items, enlist a pest-management professional.\n\nCool: You can now stay in a giant guitar-shaped hotel that you have to see to believe\n\nHmm: Congress takes on 'hidden fees' at hotels and resorts. Here's what it could mean for travelers\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/hotels/2019/10/30/bed-bugs-hotel-room-what-you-need-know-bedbugs-hotels/2486528001/", "description": "One of the last things anyone wants to see after entering a hotel room is a creepy, crawly bedbug \u2014 or to wake up with bedbug bites.", "authors": ["David Oliver", "Published A.M.
