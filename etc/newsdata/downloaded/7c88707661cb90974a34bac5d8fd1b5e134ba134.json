I traveled all over the world with him. And he would sometimes, when we were seated with world leaders, and they would look away from me, he'd say, \"Senator Klobuchar is the lead Democrat on this trip, and she will go next.\"\n\nKlobuchar said: 'I still remember being there at his ranch. John (her husband) and I went to visit him and Cindy (McCain) when he was dying. And he pointed to some words in his book, because he could hardly talk. And the words says this: \"There is nothing more liberating in life than fighting for a cause larger than yourself.\"'\n\nMeghan shared a picture hugging her father, adding: 'This is the night he won New Hampshire in 2000. And I will say goodnight and leave you all with that. People remember him and love him for bringing America together not dividing it apart. Thank you for the beautiful closing answer Senator Klobuchar'\n\n'And I still remember being there at his ranch. John (her husband) and I went to visit him and Cindy (McCain) when he was dying. And he pointed to some words in his book, because he could hardly talk. And the words says this: \"There is nothing more liberating in life than fighting for a cause larger than yourself.\"'\n\nHer moving comments were praised by McCain's daughter Meghan on Twitter, who said: 'I miss you so much Dad.'\n\nMeghan shared a picture hugging her father, adding: 'This is the night he won New Hampshire in 2000. And I will say goodnight and leave you all with that. People remember him and love him for bringing America together not dividing it apart. Thank you for the beautiful closing answer Senator Klobuchar.'\n\nIn her response Klobuchar also said: 'We have to remember that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us.\n\n'And we have to remember that our job is to not just change policy, but to change the tone in our politics, to look up from our phones, to look at each other, to start talking to each other, because the way we win - and not just win the presidency, but take back the U.S. Senate - is by winning big.'\n\nBiden, answering Cooper's question, said: 'John McCain worked for me when he worked in the Navy, and he was - he was my assigned to me to travel around the world. We became close friends. He became very close friends with my wife, Jill. Visited our home. He was there with his children.\n\n'And on his death bed, he asked me to do his eulogy. John, I would say to John, \"John, you didn't see a war you never wanted to fight.\" And he'd say, \"You didn't see a problem you never wanted to solve.\" But he was a great man of principle. He was honorable. He was honorable.'\n\nJoe Biden, who delivered a eulogy at McCain's funeral in September 2018, also named the late Senator\n\nIn response to Cooper's question others also named colleagues from across the aisle, Bernie Sanders mentioned Utah Senator Mike Lee; Kamala Harris said Senator Rand Paul; and Tulsi Gabbard said former Representative Trey Gowdy.\n\nDespite the touching words, others tweeted their anger last night at what they perceived were wasted minutes which could have been spent scrutinizing the candidates.\n\nCooper had framed his question by using the recent example of the apparently unlikely sight of Ellen DeGeneres and George Bush laughing together at a Dallas Cowboys game on October 6.\n\nThe Mayor of San Antonio, Julian Castro, tweeted: 'Three hours and no questions tonight about climate, housing, or immigration. Climate change is an existential threat. America has a housing crisis. Children are still in cages at our border.\n\n'But you know, Ellen.'", "description": "CNN host Anderson Cooper was asking the candidates in Ohio about friendships they had which might 'surprise us and what impact it's had.'", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/11/19782908-0-image-a-50_1571221790471.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
