Again, his appeals went unfulfilled.\n\nSo in the span of roughly 30 seconds, the seemingly inconceivable had unfolded. A man who is virtually impossible to miss \u2014 consider his outsized 6-foot-11 frame, booming baritone and reputation as an agitator with the \u201cBad Boy\u201d Detroit Pistons of the 1980s \u2014 essentially went ignored.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s ah, what the right word is,\u201d Mystics Coach Mike Thibault said of Laimbeer, pausing before finishing his thought. \u201cHe has a large personality to go with his physique, and he coaches kind of like he played, He wants to have an intimidating team.\u201d\n\nPregame antics and late-game frustration give Aces something to build on\n\nAlso serving as the Aces\u2019 president of basketball operations, Laimbeer has constructed a flourishing franchise in less than two years since being hired, extending a track record of winning that drew notice from his peers shortly after he accepted his first job as a WNBA coach.\n\nLaimbeer took over the Detroit Shock during the middle of the 2002 season and a year later directed them to the first of three WNBA championships. He also was named WNBA coach of the year in 2003, the first of two such awards.\n\nThe winning attitude he has managed to cultivate throughout his professional basketball career was particularly attractive to MGM Resorts International, which purchased the San Antonio Stars in 2017, then relocated to Las Vegas and hired Laimbeer away from the New York Liberty.\n\nTwo years later, he has the Aces, who missed the playoffs last season, ahead of schedule, nearly wresting home-court advantage from Washington, the No. 1 seed, in the series opener thanks to storming back from a 13-point deficit with 6:23 left in the fourth quarter.\n\nThey failed to manufacture anything close Thursday night, fading down the stretch in a 103-89 loss, but are heading home for Sunday night\u2019s Game 3, seeking at least to avoid a sweep. The fourth-seeded Aces went 13-4 at home during the regular season.\n\n\u201cIt was important for our players and our franchise to be in a series because it teaches them and gets them learning,\u201d Laimbeer said Thursday morning after the Aces\u2019 shootaround. \u201cI keep saying this is year two of three. If it happens this year, wonderful, and we have a chance to do that.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cit\u201d and \u201cthat\u201d of course is winning a championship, an accomplishment Laimbeer initially enjoyed 30 years ago as the starting center for the Pistons, who swept the Los Angeles Lakers, led by Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, for the first of consecutive NBA titles.\n\nIn the Eastern Conference finals that season, the Pistons won three straight games to close out Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls, deploying a defensive assault they proclaimed \u201cThe Jordan Rules\u201d in an effort to blunt the production of the future nine-time NBA scoring champion.\n\nLaimbeer relished his role as an enforcer of \u201cThe Jordan Rules,\u201d much as he did in committing emphatic fouls against the likes of Abdul-Jabbar, Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, Charles Barkley and other Hall of Famers on opponents the Pistons faced regularly in the playoffs.\n\n\u201cHe wants to be a physical team, and so he drafts players and goes after players in that mold,\u201d said Thibault, who was the Bulls\u2019 director of player personnel and an assistant coach from 1982 through \u201986.\n\nTake Laimbeer\u2019s most important acquisition this past offseason, Liz Cambage.\n\nThe rugged 6-8 Aussie is among the most skilled scorers in the world, preferring to collect the vast majority of her points in the painted area. She had a team-high 23 points and 10 rebounds in Game 2.\n\nThe 2018 WNBA MVP runner-up came to the Aces after requesting a trade from the Dallas Wings, who received Moriah Jefferson, Isabelle Harrison and first- and second-round picks in the 2020 draft in the deal Laimbeer orchestrated.\n\nThen there was the addition of 6-4 forward A\u2019ja Wilson as the No. 1 overall selection in the 2018 draft.\n\nWorking with Laimbeer to become a more polished post player, Wilson went on to win rookie of the year. She also had won a national championship at South Carolina under Coach Dawn Staley, one of the greatest point guards in women\u2019s basketball history who played in three Final Fours at Virginia.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s someone who has definitely helped me out in my first two years here,\u201d Wilson said. As for Staley, she \u201creally kind of harped on the guards, but now having a coach that played my position, that\u2019s been where I am, he can really help me mentally and just kind of on the X\u2019s and O\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThe instruction for post players has included video of Laimbeer from his time with the Pistons, at first eliciting snickers from players. They occasionally roll their eyes these days when asked about watching footage, ancient by some of their standards, of their coach sporting trademark short shorts from a bygone era.\n\nBut there is a greater purpose to viewing Laimbeer during his playing days, and it has nothing to do with vanity. It all goes back to winning \u2014 which he did plenty of in the NBA \u2014 learning how to infuse that culture into a locker room and then regularly carrying it onto the court.\n\nEven Las Vegas bookmakers were convinced, with the Westgate in the preseason installing the Aces as a league-best 5-2 favorite to win a title.\n\n\u201cI threw everything I could at them this year,\u201d Laimbeer said. \u201cAll my experience from a player and a coach, some all-time stories, what to expect from the media. What had people follow us around for a month at a time, which is unusual, but they had to learn that aspect of the business.\n\n\u201cThey had to learn how referees are going to behave. Everybody picked us number one, and I said, \u2018No way,\u2019 so they had to handle that pressure throughout the course of the season, so all those factors I tried to give them everything I knew and experienced.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nElena Delle Donne, the WNBA\u2019s MVP, is right at home with the Mystics\n\nElena Delle Donne freed her mind, and a historic season followed\n\nThe inaugural Mystics almost never won.
