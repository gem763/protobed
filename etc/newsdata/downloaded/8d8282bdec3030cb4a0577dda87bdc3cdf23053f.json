Both funds are replete with dividend payers, but the Vanguard fund returned 22% through Aug. 30 and the ProShares fund returned 16%.\n\nA key difference? The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF had nearly a 9% weighting in technology stocks as of July 31, while the Aristocrats ETF recently had less than 2% of its portfolio in tech names.\n\n\u201cCompanies exhibiting stronger earnings growth to support regular dividend hikes have been in greater demand than those more value-oriented ones offering higher income streams,\u201d says Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual-fund research at CFRA.\n\nGrowth Trumps Yield Funds favoring stocks with growing dividends, as opposed to higher yields, have generally outperformed this year. Data as of Aug. 30 Sources: CFRA and Morningstar\n\nThe 57 S&P 500 Aristocrats, which include Coca-Cola (KO) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), have increased their dividends for at least 25 straight years. Many tech companies are precluded, even more-established firms like Microsoft (MSFT), which didn\u2019t initiate a dividend until 2003.\n\nOn the other hand, the Vanguard appreciation fund\u2019s top five holdings were recently tech stalwarts Microsoft and Visa (V), as well as old-line dividend payers Procter & Gamble (PG), Walmart (WMT), and Comcast (CMCSA).\n\nStill, Rosenbluth cautions that it\u2019s important to look at funds individually, not in terms of broad categories. \u201cThe devil is often in the details because the performance of these dividend growth ETFs is notably different depending on the exposure,\u201d he says. \u201cTech stocks are relatively newer entrants to the dividend world.\u201d\n\nThe outperformance of dividend growth funds is also part of a broader trend that has seen growth fare much better than value. If a stock has a high yield, it can signal underpformance and fall into the value category.\n\nThe Russell 1000 Growth Index has returned 22.1% this year, compared with 13.2% for the comparable value index. That outperformance has occurred over one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods as well.\n\nOf the six exchange-traded funds in the accompanying table, the three tilted to dividend growth have had the best performance in 2019.\n\nThe worst performer of the funds shown in the table is the Invesco S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility (SPHD), up 9.1%. The fund looks for higher-yielding stocks but with lower volatility based on recent performance.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nAs of June 30, its top holdings included Ford Motor (F), which was recently yielding 6.5%, and AT&T (T), which sports a yield of nearly 6%. Both stocks have gained more than 20% this year. But other holdings such as Altria Group (MO), which is down about 8% and yields around 7%, have dampened the portfolio\u2019s returns.\n\nStill, higher-yielding, more defensive companies \u201cshould provide downside protection because that yield is more of a buffer,\u201d says Rosenbluth.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of last year, for example, the Invesco fund returned minus 6.75%, compared with minus 13.52% for the S&P 500.\n\nThe fund\u2019s 12-month yield is 4.29%, versus 1.74% for the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF, according to Morningstar .\n\nIn 2019 at least, investors in that fund are getting a better yield but with less capital appreciation compared to dividend portfolios with more of a growth bent.\n\nFor dividend investors, finding the right long-term balance between yield and capital appreciation is the hard part.\n\nWrite to Lawrence C.
