ISIS is another name for the Islamic State, the militant group whose rise drew the U.S. military into Syria.\n\nAD\n\nPentagon chief says a solo incursion by Turkey into Syria is \u2018unacceptable,\u2019 but doesn\u2019t pledge to stop it\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces, a major Kurdish group that has fought closely with the U.S. military, said the U.S. troops had already begun pulling out and criticized them for not fulfilling their obligations.\n\n\u201cThe United States forces have not fulfilled their obligations and withdrew their forces from the border area with Turkey,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis Turkish military operation in north and east Syria will have a big negative impact on our war against Daesh and will destroy all stability that was reached in the last few years.\u201d The statement used the Arabic acronym for ISIS.\n\nAD\n\nIt added that the group reserved the right to defend itself against Turkish aggression.\n\nErdogan, who has portrayed a Turkish incursion as necessary to protect his country\u2019s borders, has spoken in recent weeks of resettling millions of Syrian refugees in Turkey in a \u201csafe zone\u201d in northern Syria, a plan that has been criticized by refugee advocates as well as local Syrian Kurds who could be displaced by such a proposal.\n\nOn Saturday, Erdogan said the invasion could begin \u201cas soon as today or maybe tomorrow.\u201d The operation \u2014 which he called \u201cfountains of peace\u201d \u2014 would be conducted by air and land, he said.\n\nAD\n\nU.S. officials depicted the impending offensive, and the U.S. troop withdrawal, as a dramatic turn after their prolonged attempt to hammer out an arrangement that would allay the Turks\u2019 concerns about Syrian Kurdish forces close to their border, while also averting a battle they fear will be bloody for Kurdish fighters who the Pentagon see as a stalwart ally.\n\nAD\n\nMilitary officials point out that Kurdish assistance is still required to avoid a return of the Islamic State in Syria and to guard facilities where Islamic State militants and their families are being held.\n\nA senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an evolving situation, said the U.S. government \u201chas no idea\u201d what the Turkish operation would look like, whether it would be a small, symbolic incursion or a major offensive intended to push 30 or 40 kilometers into Syria.\n\nAD\n\nU.S. officials said an operation deep into Syria could further jeopardize the security of ISIS prisons. \u201cThere are many potential disastrous outcomes to this,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe White House announcement comes only two days after the Pentagon completed its most recent joint patrol with Turkish forces in northern Syria, a central element of the U.S. effort to build trust in northern Syria. But a series of similar patrols and other measures overseen from a joint U.S.-Turkish military hub in southern Turkey have not reduced Ankara\u2019s impatience to establish the buffer zone it has envisioned.\n\nAD\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Friday, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper described ongoing U.S.-Turkish cooperation in northern Syria, saying that his Turkish counterpart had agreed in a call last week \u201cthat we need to make the security mechanism work.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn negotiations, the United States had said it would agree to a strip along the border to be cleared of Syrian Kurdish fighters and jointly patrolled by the United States and Turkey on the ground and in the air. That strip is about five miles wide, only about a quarter of what the Turks have demanded.\n\nSyria camp is at risk of falling under ISIS control, Kurdish general says\n\nErdogan\u2019s plan to send at least 3 million Syrian refugees into the 140 mile-long strip is also counter to what the United States says was part of the agreement they had reached to allow only the 700,000 to 800,000 refugees who originally fled the area to resettle there.\n\nAD\n\nThe joint patrols are taking place in only about a third of the border length with a plan to gradually expand them. In addition to not liking U.S. terms for the agreement, Erdogan believes the United States is dragging its feet in implementing it.\n\nAD\n\nIbrahim Kalin, a spokesman for Erdogan, wrote on Twitter that Turkey\u2019s proposed border zone would keep Turkey safe while allowing displaced Syrians to return. \u201cTurkey is strong and determined,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter months of warning about the turmoil such a move could have, U.S. officials said they are now watching Turkey\u2019s actions closely to inform their own decisions about how quickly they must move the hundreds of troops expected to be affected.\n\n\u201cWe're gonna get out of the way,\u201d another U.S. official said.\n\nThere are about 1,000 U.S. troops in northeast Syria.\n\n\n\nThe SDF also predicted that Islamic State fighters would break out of prison camps the SDF manages in different areas of Syria.\n\nThe potential for greater risk to Islamic State prisons and camps comes after months of unsuccessful efforts by the Trump administration to convince countries in Europe and elsewhere to repatriate their citizens.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe White House statement said that \u201cTurkey will now be responsible for all ISIS fighters\u201d in that area. \u201cThe United States will not hold them for what could be many years and great cost to the United States taxpayer,\u201d Grisham said.\n\nThe planned offensive comes amid already heightened U.S. tensions with its NATO ally Turkey, over Ankara\u2019s plans to operate a sophisticated Russian air defense system.\n\nFahim reported from Batman, Turkey, Dadouch from Beirut.
