The guest house claims nearly 650 square feet, with two bedrooms and a bathroom.\n\nMore: What are the Property Taxes on a Cannes, France, Home?\n\nAmenities\n\nThe basement of the main house has a gym and a sauna as well as a wine cellar.\n\nOutside, anchoring the manicured grounds, a swimming pool splashes near the guest house, where its serenity yields to the cerulean Mediterranean waters.\n\nAmid the abundant vegetation also lies a tennis court shared with the owners of two other properties.\n\nThere\u2019s also a four-car garage.\n\nNeighborhood Notes\n\nPart of Antibes on Cote d\u2019Azur, or the famed French Riviera, Cap d\u2019Antibes rivets with its rugged, rocky edges and lush blanket of local flora. The villas that nestle on the peninsula often are owned by celebrities, who seek the privacy of the community away from the tourist bustle in Antibes.\n\n\"The neighborhood is cosmopolitan, quiet and residential,\" Ms. Lemoine said.\n\nFrom Penta: Sotheby\u2019s to Offer Francis Bacon\u2019s \u2018Pope\u2019 on Behalf of Brooklyn Museum\n\nAs is expected from an enclave on the Mediterranean seashore, Cap d\u2019Antibes lends itself to boating and yachting. On its east coast, among private docks, lies Port Salis, near a stretch of sandy beach\u2014one of just a few along the otherwise craggy promontory. To the west, small, fishing boats dot Port de l\u2019Olivette.\n\nAlthough not devoid of its own historic and architectural sites, Cap d\u2019Antibes borders what is one of Antibes\u2019 primary attractions\u2014the old town, with its tall buildings huddled along narrow, winding cobblestone streets.\n\nLocated between the cities of Cannes and Nice, Antibes, as well as its eponymous peninsula, are easily accessible by land, air and sea.\n\nListing agent: Martine Lemoine, Christie\u2019s International Real Estate affiliate Micha\u00ebl Zingraf\n\nView the listing here.
