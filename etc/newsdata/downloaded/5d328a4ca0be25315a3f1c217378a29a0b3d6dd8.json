The premier needs almost all of them to support him if his deal is to pass.0930 Parliament opens. Johnson will set out his deal in a statement, taking questions from Members of Parliament.1100 (roughly) When Johnson\u2019s statement is finished, they move to debating the deal. Speaker of the Commons John Bercow announces which amendments will be voted on. The one to watch has been proposed by Oliver Letwin.1430 (roughly) It\u2019s likely an MP will propose moving to a vote around this point.\n\nHow does voting work? For a detailed look at the procedure, see: Order! Order! How the U.K. Parliament Will Vote on Brexit\n\nHow are the votes stacking up? See our tally: Can Johnson Pull Off the Impossible? We\u2019re Counting the Votes\n\nThey will vote on the amendments first. The government wants its motion not to be amended, so a \u201cNo\u201d vote is a win for Johnson, and a \u201cYes\u201d vote is a defeat. Each vote takes around 15 minutes.\n\nIf Letwin\u2019s motion passes:\n\nJohnson is required by law to seek a delay to Brexit.They will then vote on the motion as amended.The government can\u2019t withdraw its motion at this point.Letwin argues that if his amendment has passed, the vote can still indicate how much support there is for Johnson\u2019s deal. But it would have no legal effect.\n\nIf Letwin\u2019s amendment is defeated, or isn\u2019t selected for a vote:\n\nThey will vote on the unamended motionA \u201cYes\u201d vote is a win for Johnson. He will not be required to seek a delay to Brexit.A \u201cNo\u201d vote means Johnson is required to ask the European Union for more time.\n\nIf the deal is rejected, Johnson could choose to ask for a vote on whether the U.K. should leave the EU without a deal. In practice, this is unlikely, because it would reveal how little support that idea has in Parliament. If Johnson does push the question, an amendment has been proposed that would call instead for a second referendum.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Robert Hutton in London at rhutton1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tim Ross at tross54@bloomberg.net, Robert Jameson\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Britain\u2019s Parliament meets Saturday to pass judgment on Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal.
