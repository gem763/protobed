And then probably moved it on a few more notches too.\n\nWoodhill was Smith\u2019s batting coach at Sutherland Cricket Club in south Sydney when he was still a teenager. What most people who view cricket along traditional lines saw back then was an outstandingly gifted cricketer but one with a strong bottom hand grip who had a predilection for playing across the line. In other words, Smith was undeniably gifted but was very much a cricketer who needed to spend a lot more time acquainting himself with a coaching manual.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

His appetite for batting is huge and that hasn\u2019t changed.\n\n\u201cCricket has this great way of destroying itself from within. You\u2019ve seen glimpses of Steve in players like Viv Richards and Javed Miandad. I would love to have seen Barry Richards play a full career as an international player to see where he would have got. Same with Graeme Pollock.\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019ve got players like your (Steve) Waughs, your (Allan) Borders , your (Jacques) Kallises. They had to conform even though they had unbelievable careers.\n\n\u201cI think Steven is the first one who has just said \u2018f**k it \u2013 I\u2019m not conforming, the whole aim of the game is to score runs and I\u2019m going to do whatever I can to score runs\u2019.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not used to seeing someone play like that and that\u2019s what I talk about when I say about conforming.\n\n\u201cEvery article over here starts with the words \u2018a former great\u2019. Someone like Mark Taylor. The problem with the former greats is that they don\u2019t understand how good this guy is because it doesn\u2019t look how you want it to look.\u201d\n\nAs Australia celebrated retaining the Ashes at Old Trafford late on Sunday afternoon, Smith had every excuse to offer a retort to those who have continued to view his technique through a classical lens \u2013 and criticised him accordingly whenever handed the chance.\n\nBut when you\u2019ve scored 671 runs at an average of 134 in just three Ashes Tests, you\u2019ve pretty much let your batting do the talking anyway.\n\nNow, with the final Test approaching, Don Bradman\u2019s record total of 974 runs during the 1930 series between the two sides might just be beyond him, so might Wally Hammond\u2019s 905 runs from 1928/29.\n\nBut he should be confident of jumping ahead of Arthur Morris (674 runs), David Gower (732 runs), Herbert Sutcliffe (734 runs), Alastair Cook (766 runs) and maybe even Mark Taylor (839 runs) on the all-time Ashes series run-scoring list by the time he has put his bat away for a final time this summer at the Oval.\n\nWhatever happens it hasn\u2019t been a bad return for a man who this time last year was wondering whether he would ever play a Test for his country again.\n\n\u201cTake in the time off for the suspension (a one-year ban for ball tampering in a Test against South Africa in Cape Town in March 2018) and that has just exacerbated the situation,\u201d says Woodhill.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t ever want to have a bad day because he has to make up for what was taken away from him.\n\n\u201cThe natural reaction is to suggest that Steve Smith will get found out in the end. But everyone has been waiting for Steve Smith to get found out since 2013. He has gone past that. He\u2019s never going to be found out. It\u2019s just what ceiling he places on himself now, I think.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, Woodhill is gone. He has to take another call. This time from David Warner, another player he has worked with closely in the past.\n\nHe, of course, is a man with slightly more weighing on his mind after a dismal series that has seen him score just 79 runs at an average of 9.87 in four Tests.\n\nFortunately for Australia, Smith has more than made-up for that shortfall.", "description": "Trent Woodhill wants to making something abundantly clear after a summer that has seen Steve Smith redefine the art of run scoring.
