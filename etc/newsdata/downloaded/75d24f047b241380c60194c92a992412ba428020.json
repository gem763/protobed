The camera is just 0.575 x 0.575 x 0.232mm in size. It has also been awarded the Guinness World Record for the 'Smallest Commercially Available Image Sensor.\"\n\nThe sensor is capable of capturing a 40,000 pixel colour image with the help of an RGB Bayer chip. The camera has a 1/36-inch optical format with support for capturing videos at 30fps and resolution of 200x200 pixels.\n\nDon't Miss 15.7 K SHARES 11.6 K SHARES 1.6 K SHARES\n\nEven though the sensor is tiny, it has some serious low-light performance. The sensor is also capable of capturing 120-degree wide-angle imagery with a depth of field range up to 30 mm. It is also, as per company claims, the only ultra-small chip-on-chip camera which supports backside illumination.\n\nPotential use for the world's smallest camera sensor\n\nNow you might be wondering where can such a small camera be helpful. For starters, this camera could revolutionise medical processes like endoscopies and catheters that can now be made smaller and thus make the experience comfortable for patients and doctors. OmniVision also states that the camera can be applied to other fields too, such as spy equipment, wearables etc.\n\nAs per the post on company's website, \"Due to the sensor's low power consumption, less heat is generated at the distal tip of the endoscope, improving patient comfort and thus permitting longer-duration procedures. The sensor enables easy integration, with a 4-pin interface and analog data output, capable of data transmission of up to 4 meters with minimal signal noise.\"\n\nUniversity of Utah\n\nMany people are trying to make cameras smaller. Recently, engineers at the University of Utah developed an extremely thin camera lens (thinner than human hair) where the glass is flat as opposed to conventional curved lenses.\n\nIn a conventional lens, light is captured off the object and bent before it reaches the sensor. However, the newer lens has microstructures which instead directly bends the light at the sensor.", "description": "The camera is developed by California based OmniVision.
