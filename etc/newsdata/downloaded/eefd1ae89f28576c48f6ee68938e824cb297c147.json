(Mike Blake/Reuters)\n\nAttacks on crucial Saudi oil installations crippled the world\u2019s second-largest oil producer and sparked new geopolitical tensions \u2014 but how much pain consumers feel will hinge on how long it takes normal output to return, experts say.\n\nThe weekend drone strikes marked the biggest disruption to Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil industry since the early 1990s, but if crude stockpiles can tide over global markets and production bounces back quickly, the episode will have a negligible effect on pump prices.\n\nShould the recovery take weeks or months, though, the impact could be far-reaching. Higher fuel prices can not only motivate consumers to cut spending elsewhere but also ultimately reach into virtually every corner of the economy. Airlines, cruise ships, trucking, railroads and retailers all will feel the pinch of higher fuel prices.\n\nState-run Saudi Aramco churned out 9.85 million barrels per day in August, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But Saturday\u2019s attack on an oil processing plant and nearby oil field forced the kingdom to suspend production of 5.7 million barrels of crude, or nearly 6 percent of the 100 million barrels the world consumes each day.\n\nThe situation weighed on Wall Street, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 165 points before the benchmark index recovered somewhat. The Dow closed down 142 points, or about 0.5 percent, finishing the day at 27,076. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq composite closed down about 0.3 percent each. The S&P index closed at 2,997. The Nasdaq closed at 8,153.\n\nThe Saudi company initially said it hoped to restore a third of that lost production \u2014 about 2 million barrels \u2014 by Monday, and it has given no timetable for a full recovery. The prospect of tightening supplies sent energy stocks higher as oil prices jumped about 13 percent, one of their strongest days in years. Brent crude futures were selling at $68 per barrel around 4 p.m. on Monday; U.S. West Texas intermediate was trading at more than $61 per barrel.\n\nShares in the big international oil companies \u2014 known as the supermajors \u2014 climbed on global markets. U.S. petroleum giant ExxonMobil advanced 1.5 percent, to $73.73; Chevron finished at $124.12, up more than 2 percent; while BP spiked nearly 4 percent, to $39.35. Companies that service and supply the supermajors and Middle East producers were up even more. Schlumberger Limited jumped 5.3 percent, and Halliburton leaped 11 percent on expectations of more business following the attacks.\n\n\u201cThe Schlumbergers and the Halliburtons supply the equipment for the drilling, so if we have a big supply disruption like we have now, they are going to have to do the drilling and probably the repairs,\u201d said Bill Selesky of Argus Research. \u201cThat\u2019s why those two are both trading up pretty good today.\u201d\n\nConsumers could be looking at a 10- to 25-cent increase in gas prices in the coming weeks, said Ed Moya, an analyst with OANDA. Though such a jump would be relatively modest, it would come at an unwelcome moment, threatening the U.S. economy\u2019s most powerful engine amid mounting fears of a slowdown.\n\n\u201cAll the sentiment indicators have been softening, and any pressure on the consumer could derail the case for higher equities we\u2019ve seen in recent weeks,\u201d Moya said.\n\n[Crude prices jump, Wall Street recoils after drone strike erases half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil output]\n\nConsumer spending powers about 70 percent of the U.S. economy, and retail sales rose in August, even as other key economic indicators weakened under the weight of the trade war with China.\n\nThe U.S. manufacturing sector contracted in August for the first time since 2016, and the Commerce Department recently revised second-quarter economic growth estimates because growth had slowed more than previously thought. Meanwhile, constant trade tensions and signs of a slowdown are sending investors into the bond market in droves.\n\nFalling demand had sent gas prices lower after Labor Day, so consumers should be able to bear a short-term surge in prices more easily. On Monday, the average price for a gallon of gas in the United States was $2.564 according to AAA, about 28 cents lower than a year ago.\n\n\u201cOil price spikes due to geopolitical crises in the past have had a depressing impact on U.S. consumers when they filled up their tanks,\u201d said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. \u201cIt costs them a few more bucks when they fill up, and so consumers hunker down and cut spending in other areas. That hurts the economy.\u201d\n\nDespite Monday\u2019s oil price spikes, prices are a long way from hitting records. In June 2014, the price of oil was $105.40 per barrel. Since then, oil prices have declined, and the energy sector index of the S&P 500 has dropped along with it. The S&P energy index on Monday afternoon was up 3.6 percent, which is one of its best days of the year but still down more than 36 percent since June 2014, according to Howard Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nMoya estimated that an increase would last a month or so, provided that political tensions ease and there are no further attacks. Officials have said Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil stockpile will allow it to meet export obligations for several weeks while Aramco recovers, and OPEC and Russia are holding off on unleashing additional supplies for now despite the magnitude of disruption.\n\nAramco is reportedly considering a delay in its initial public offering until production returns to normal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think even Aramco\u2019s limited listing on the Saudi stock exchange can withstand this event,\u201d said John Kilduff of Again Capital. \u201cThis attack is a material adverse change to the company. They are going to have to do a lot more risk disclosure in their IPO document as it relates to Iran and the region.\u201d\n\nIf Saudi production doesn\u2019t recover quickly, there will be implications for other consumer travel costs. In 2018, the global airline industry spent $180 billion on fuel, accounting for 23.5 percent of operating expenses, according to the International Air Transport Association.\n\n\u201cThe hardest hit on this price surge is the cruise ships and the airlines,\u201d Moya said. \u201cI think you\u2019d see bit of a waiting period, but those costs would be passed on. You\u2019re definitely going to see that weigh on the consumer.\u201d\n\nCarnival Corporation, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines were all down more than 1.5 percent in premarket trading. Delta Air Lines was down 2.25 percent.\n\nCrude oil prices soared nearly 20 percent Monday in the largest-ever intraday jump, then declined some. Brent crude, the international benchmark, was up 14 percent Monday afternoon, trading above $68 per barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, was up 13.6 percent, trading at more than $62 per barrel.\n\nOn Sunday, President Trump announced via Twitter that he had authorized the release of a yet-unspecified amount of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to \u201ckeep the markets well-supplied.\u201d The 600-million-barrel reserve is tapped only in extreme circumstances, and it takes 13 days for SPR oil to hit markets after a presidential decision.\n\n\u2026 sufficient to keep the markets well-supplied. I have also informed all appropriate agencies to expedite approvals of the oil pipelines currently in the permitting process in Texas and various other States. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019\n\n\u201cMake no mistake: the loss of more than 5 percent of the world\u2019s supply is a supply emergency,\u201d said Bob Tippee, chief editor of Oil & Gas Journal. \u201cThere have been withdrawals for far less strenuous reasons.\u201d\n\nThe United States was both the world\u2019s largest producer and consumer of oil in 2018, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. In a tweet Monday, Trump insisted the United States wasn\u2019t reliant on Middle Eastern oil but would unleash its reserves to help allies.\n\nBecause we have done so well with Energy over the last few years (thank you, Mr. President!), we are a net Energy Exporter, & now the Number One Energy Producer in the World. We don\u2019t need Middle Eastern Oil & Gas, & in fact have very few tankers there, but will help our Allies! \u2014 Donald J.
