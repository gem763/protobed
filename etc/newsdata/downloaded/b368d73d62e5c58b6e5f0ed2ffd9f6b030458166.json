While the attack did not disrupt the flow of oil from the Kingdom, the attempts \"underscore the degree of difficulty in repelling aerial attacks\", according to a separate note.\n\nThat's destined to put a floor under oil prices in the interim, Tran warned, with \"additional potential attacks\" restricting the ability of Saudi Arabia to draw down its reserves to meet the shortfall.\n\nPresident Trump took to Twitter to signal the US could respond with force.\n\n\"There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed,\" Trump said.\n\nRead more: Trump says US is 'locked and loaded' in response to attack on Saudi oil supply\n\nIt comes after oil prices fell last week on the news that National Security Adviser John Bolton had departed the White House, leading to hopes that tensions with Iran would abate.\n\n\"One thing we can say with confidence is that if that part of the reason for last week's fall in oil and improvement in geopolitical risk sentiment was the news of John Bolton's sacking... then it is no longer valid,\" National Australia Bank head of FX strategy Ray Attrill said in a note.\n\nThe currencies of major oil exporters Canada and Norway both rose 0.5% and 0.6% in response, while the Japanese yen, perceived as a safe-haven currency, rose more than 0.3% on the US dollar.\n\nWhile energy sectors are expected to rally on the news, the broader indices did not seem to be suffering as a result of the attack when the first began opening on Monday.\n\nAustralia's ASX 200 and China's Shanghai Composite were both trading flat, while Korea's KOSPI was up almost 0.5% as of 12 am EDT. Japan's NIKKEI was closed on a public holiday.", "description": "The attack that wiped out 5% of the world's global oil production was \"not a one-off,\" a commodity trader has warned, as geopolitical tensions rise.", "authors": ["Jack Derwin"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7f0e012e22af0c9b6c29c3-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
