(the \"Company\" or \u201cRock Tech\u201d) (TSX-V: RCK; Frankfurt: RJIB) is pleased to report that it has entered into a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (\u201cMOU\u201d) with Ardiden Limited (ASX: ADV), a nearby lithium explorer.\n\n\n\nRock Tech and Ardiden will endeavor to work together to develop the potential supply of spodumene concentrate with a grade between 6% and 7% lithium oxide (\u201cLi 2 O\u201d), initially using the resources of their two flagship lithium projects, Rock Tech\u2019s Georgia Lake project and Ardiden\u2019s Seymour Lake project. An important focus will be the design and evaluation of the best suitable processing and infrastructure facilities at Rock Tech\u2019s Georgia Lake project.\n\n\u201cWe are very happy to work with Ardiden as a first-step to consolidate assets in this important North American mining region,\u201d said Dirk Harbecke, Rock Tech\u2019s Chairman. \u201cAs our lithium projects are proximal to each other, we have multiple beneficial synergies. Both projects have direct access to rail, port, highway and power supply. This cooperation represents an opportunity for us to potentially secure additional feedstock for the planned concentration plant at our Georgia Lake site without further expenses for drilling on our property. It is also an additional step for fulfilling our vision to prospectively build further downstream lithium processing facilities at the nearby regional mining and logistics hub of Thunder Bay.\u201d\n\nFigure 1 \u2013Rock Tech\u2019s and Ardiden\u2019s Lithium Projects in northwest Ontario, Canada\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/899451b0-96fb-42f1-a51d-a4fda7698756\n\nAdditionally, Rock Tech and Ardiden aim to work together to develop the optimal transportation of potential feedstock from the Seymour Lake project to the Georgia Lake project, progressively bring additional spodumene resources on-stream from other 100%-owned Ontario lithium projects and develop options for joint value-adding strategies through potential development of downstream processing facilities at Thunder Bay, Ontario.\n\nThe Georgia Lake Lithium Project\n\nIn June 2018, Rock Tech released a resource estimate, prepared in accordance with NI 43-101, that included measured and indicated resources of 6.57 million tonnes averaging 1.01% Li 2 O and inferred resources of 6.72 million tonnes averaging 1.16% Li 2 O.\n\nIn October of 2018, Rock Tech completed a preliminary economic assessment (\u201cPEA\u201d) on the \u201cMain Zone\u201d of the Georgia Lake lithium project, an area representing approximately 73% of the defined resources. The results of the PEA included a pre-tax NPV of $312 million and a pre-tax IRR of 62.2%.\n\nThe Seymour Lake Lithium Project\n\nIn March 2019, Ardiden announced an upgraded mineral resource, prepared in accordance with the JORC Code (2012), at the Seymour Lake lithium project of 4.83 million tonnes averaging 1.25% Li 2 O and 186ppm Ta 2 O5.\n\nIn addition, there are significant exploration targets present within the Seymour Lake lithium project. The aggregate exploration target for the Seymour Lake lithium project is 4.5 to 7.2 million tonnes averaging between 0.8% Li 2 O and 2.4% Li 2 O.\n\nThe quantities and grades stated for all exploration targets is conceptual in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to define mineral resources at these targets and it is uncertain if further exploration of these targets will produce results that permit mineral resources to be estimated.\n\nQualified Person\n\nAll scientific and technical information in this news release concerning the Georgia Lake lithium property was reviewed and approved by Karl-Stephan Peters, EurGeol 787, a qualified person (QP) as defined under National Instrument 43-101.\n\nCompetent Person\u2019s Statement (Ardiden Limited)\n\nThe information in this announcement that relates to the Mineral Resource Estimate and the Exploration Target adjacent to the North Aubry Mineral Resource is based on, and fairly represents, information and supporting geological information and documentation that has been prepared by Mr. Philip Alan Jones, an independent consulting geologist whom is a Member of the AusIMM and a Member of the AIG.
