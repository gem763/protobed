While smartly dressed in bespoke, black double-breasted suits, it\u2019s the crystalline veils that drip down their jawlines that make it crystal clear just what Hongjoong meant about shining brighter.\n\n\n\nATEEZ, short for \u2018A TEEnager Z\u2019, is the first K-Pop group from KQ Entertainment and consists of eight members who all range in age from nineteen and twenty-one: Hongjoong, Mingi, Wooyoung, San, Yeosang, Yunho, Jongho and Seonghwa. The group debuted in October 2018 with double title tracks 'Pirate King' and 'Treasure' and immediately emerged as genre frontrunners by mixing scorching trap beats and indomitable stage presence with a tireless work ethic and a gritty determination to see their dreams come to fruition.\n\nTheir underdog mentality, bolstered by hard-hitting cuts like 'Say My Name' and 'HALA HALA', helped ATEEZ revolutionise what it means to be a \u2018rookie\u2019 K-Pop group. In the span of a year, they've completed a world tour (including a sold-out U.S. leg), received their first win with their single 'Wave' on Korean music program M Countdown, signed with RCA Records in July, and released three EPs that each cracked the top 12 of the Billboard World Albums chart.\n\nTheir latest album, TREASURE EP.FIN: All To Action, is ATEEZ at their most inventive yet. The album completes the swashbuckling, treasure hunting storyline that they\u2019d been cultivating over their last three EPs, and leaves the group just like they were this time last year: ambitious, passionate and ready to set out on a new adventure.\n\nExploring a variety of genres including trap, EDM and R&B, All To Action proves that ATEEZ can take any song and make it their own. Lead single 'Wonderland' is an explosive, brass-heavy call to action that unleashes ATEEZ\u2019s full power with fiery rapping, fierce choreography, and growls, while \u201cMist\u201d is a pulsating R&B playground for the group\u2019s singers to sweep listeners off their feet with their poignant vocals. The secret gem on the album, however, is the uplifting pop track 'Sunrise' which was written and composed in part by Hongjoong and encourages listeners to hold out for the sunrise during their darkest moments.\n\nThe album is also full of allusions to other ATEEZ tracks; it can be heard in songs like 'Precious (Overture)' which is a reprise of 'Treasure', and seen in their choreography for 'Wonderland' which contains multiple dance moves from past tracks like 'HALA HALA' and 'Illusion'.\n\nBut underneath an intense schedule which saw them perform in three continents, there\u2019s a side to ATEEZ that vocalist Seonghwa wishes could be seen more often: their humanity. \u201cDespite our charismatic performances and how we look on stage, off-stage and behind the scenes, we\u2019re very shy. Just normal, average, twenty-year-olds,\u201d he reveals. The rest of the group nod and voice their agreement.\n\nSo who are ATEEZ when they\u2019re off stage? It\u2019s not until asked about their passions outside of work that ATEEZ\u2019s true, youthful colours come out. \u201cI like playing video games and sleeping at the dorm,\u201d vocalist Yunho chirps. Video games are the group\u2019s common thread and the conversation quickly derails as the members speak with unconfined enthusiasm about their most commonly played games: Pro Evolution Soccer and League of Legends. Mingi tosses an arm around San\u2019s shoulders and adds: \u201cSan\u2019s gaming skill is pro level.\u201d\n\nWith the release of All To Action and its single 'Wonderland', it felt fitting to go down the rabbit hole to when ATEEZ were trainees themselves, practicing day in and day out and dreaming of the day they would debut. Since then, each member\u2019s perception of what it means to be a successful K-pop idol has vastly changed as they\u2019ve watched their dreams become a reality.\n\nAs a trainee, Wooyoung never imagined that ATEEZ would receive so much love and support from fans, who racked up over 11 million views for their \u201cWonderland\u201d music video in just five days. \u201cI thought it would probably take a while for us to get fans, because I know how hard it is to be successful in this business,\u201d he answers truthfully, pursing his lips. \u201cLuckily, we received overwhelming love and support from many people and I am very honoured. I hope to grow to be a top idol in a few years; an artist who\u2019s very talented and humble at the same time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to be a role model for other dreaming artists,\u201d Yeosang replies in English without hesitation. \u201cWhen I was a trainee, I thought it would just be about performing on stage, singing, dancing and that\u2019s it. After I debuted, I realised that there\u2019s a lot more to it; I\u2019ve got to act cute, fly some hearts to fans and things like that.\u201d\n\nFlying hearts and acting cute are just the tip of the iceberg for typical fan service required of a K-Pop idol; it\u2019s also ATEEZ\u2019s \u201cfavourite part\u201d. The group has a unique relationship with their fans called ATINY, a combination of the words \u2018ATEEZ\u2019 and \u2018destiny,\u2019 and in the past have asked them to help design the group\u2019s lightstick or even choose the title track of their third album, TREASURE EP.3 : One To All, between the bouncy hip-hop track 'Illusion' and the tropical house tune 'Wave'.\n\n\u201cATINY\u2019s opinions are very important to us,\u201d answers Seonghwa. \u201cIncorporating their ideas into [ TREASURE EP.3 : One To All] made it that much more special.\"\n\nPerhaps with the love of those ATINY hearts in mind, despite a successful tour and winning their first award for Best Performance at this year\u2019s Soribada Awards, ATEEZ shows no signs of slowing down. With the release of All To Action, the band will begin a rigorous schedule performing their new single on the Korean television program circuit in between fan signs, multiple festivals performances across South Korea, their first anniversary, and celebrating Jongho\u2019s nineteenth birthday.\n\nWith their treasure hunting days behind them, the eight members of ATEEZ will chart their own course toward a new dream in the k-pop industry. \u201cWe still have a long way to go, but my dream when I was a trainee was to form a group with great teamwork and to venture out into the hip-hop, R&B genres,\u201d says Mingi, his kilowatt smile softening as he reflects. \u201cAside from looking at whether we succeed or not, I want ATEEZ to be a group that continues to venture out into unexplored territory and challenge themselves when it comes to music.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd still good teamwork!\u201d Hongjoong interjects. \u201cAnd to go on forever with eight members. That\u2019s one of our dreams too.\u201c\n\nCredits\n\nPhotography via KQ Entertainment.\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "Get to know your new favourite eight-piece treasure hunting popstars ahead of the release of their first full-length album, \"TREASURE EP.FIN: All To Action\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da45ed78ed62700094253b4/lede/1571061590989-ateez-splash.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
