Sign up here.\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 Rex Tillerson took the stand Wednesday in New York\u2019s high-profile lawsuit against ExxonMobil, and prosecutors didn\u2019t even ask him about his alter ego, \u201cWayne Tracker.\u201d\n\nTillerson used that name to email his underlings about climate change when he served as CEO of Exxon from 2006 until the end of 2016. But instead of asking him about that correspondance, prosecutors grilled President Trump\u2019s former Secretary of State on whether Exxon defrauded investors by using different calculations to account for the cost of future climate change regulations.\n\nThat\u2019s the crux of New York\u2019s case: The state claims Exxon kept one set of public numbers to account for the future costs of greenhouse gas regulations, and another, much lower set, to make business decisions.\n\n\u201cDid you have your head in the sand?\u201d defense attorney Theodore Wells asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tillerson responded.\n\nDuring his time at Exxon, Tillerson semi-officially went by \u201cWayne Tracker\u201d \u2014 \u201cWayne\u201d is Tillerson\u2019s middle name, but there\u2019s no word on why he used \u201cTracker\u201d \u2014 and he admitted to using the email address, wayne.tracker@exxonmobil.com, for much of his official business.\n\nTillerson left the email account that used his actual name, rex.w.tillerson@exxonmobil.com, for his assistant to sort through. He just got too many emails on that account, he said.\n\nBut when New York subpoenaed his emails, the company had deleted them in what it said was a routine sweep.\n\nNew York was widely expected to argue that, because the email account contained information relevant to the investigation, Exxon shouldn\u2019t have deleted them. The prosecution focused on proving that Exxon lied to investors about the different sets of numbers.\n\nNew York prosecutor Kim Berger put internal emails on the screen in the courtroom as evidence in which Exxon execs said they knew Tillerson preferred the lower estimates for climate change regulation costs, which made new oil and gas investments look more profitable.\n\n\u201cWell it\u2019s kind of a matter of math,\u201d Tillserson, who insists he made a good-faith effort to accurately account for costs, said on the witness stand. \u201cIf you set a high number it\u2019ll help some investments, it\u2019ll hurt others.\u201d\n\nWells also asked Tillerson how he felt about being accused of fraud by the state of New York.\n\n\u201cI feel badly for the men and women at the ExxonMobil corporation, the ones who work hard to put all of this together to inform the management, because they\u2019re being accused of fraud as well,\u201d Tillerson.\n\nCover image: Former Exxon CEO and ex-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson leaves a courthouse in New York, Wednesday, Oct. 30, 2019.
