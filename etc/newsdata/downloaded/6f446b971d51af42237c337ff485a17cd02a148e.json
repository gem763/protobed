(Evan Vucci)\n\nOn the day after his defense was trampled for the second straight game, Washington Redskins Coach Jay Gruden started talking about quarterbacks. As in the ease with which Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott stood in the pocket on Sunday afternoon and waited patiently for his receivers to get open.\n\n\u201cThe pass rush is not there,\u201d Gruden said.\n\n\u201cPrescott\u2019s patting the ball two and three times,\u201d he added.\n\nThen he frowned.\n\n\u201cAnd when we do get the pass rush, we\u2019re not tight enough in coverage,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a combination really. I\u2019m not blaming the pass rush. I\u2019m not blaming the coverage. So we might have to get some more exotic looks to make the quarterback hold the ball a little longer to get home with the pressure.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins are supposed to have one of the NFL\u2019s better defenses, both according to their players and coaches but also based on the recent investments the team has made in the unit via free agency and the draft. But after the season\u2019s first two games they are 30th in the league in yards allowed with 910 and have given up more than 30 points on each Sunday. Opponents are converting 64 percent of their third downs.\n\nSome of the reason for this is the kind of basic defense Washington has been playing, one without many blitzes or disguised coverages.\n\n\u201cVanilla\u201d is the word Gruden used to describe it.\n\n[Svrluga: The Redskins\u2019 defense was supposed to be the strength of the team. It\u2019s not.]\n\nWhen asked why the Redskins would play such a basic defense against two important division opponents such as Philadelphia and Dallas, he pointed to the five new regulars in the group \u2014 three of whom are rookies.\n\n\u201cYouth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re mixing and matching in the secondary.\u201d\n\nInjuries to experienced cornerbacks Quinton Dunbar and Fabian Moreau are forcing Washington to play younger players such as rookie Jimmy Moreland and scrambling to find free agents to fill in as backups. Against the Eagles in Week 1 there were blown coverages that led to two long touchdowns by Philadelphia\u2019s star wide receiver DeSean Jackson. Gruden said his staff didn\u2019t want the same thing to happen against Dallas.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want [big plays] to happen, obviously,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to challenge them and make them earn their grass and unfortunately they did, but we were a little bit more sound. We just didn\u2019t make many plays.\u201d\n\nThe season is in danger of falling apart fast. At 0-2, with both of those losses in the division, the Redskins are in trouble, especially with two of their next three games coming against Chicago and New England. Gruden talked a lot on Sunday about not hitting \u201cthe panic button.\u201d The team\u2019s newest player, former Jacksonville Jaguars and Houston Texans cornerback Aaron Colvin, talked about how the Texans team he was on last year started 0-3, with lots of defensive breakdowns, only to win its next nine in a row on the way to becoming AFC South champions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen it done before,\u201d Colvin said. \u201cI know that the media and the fans don\u2019t want to hear that, because they want to hear, \u2018What can you do for me now?\u2019 We need to win. But in this locker room we need to realize that it really isn\u2019t over, and the way we approach every single day, that correlates directly to Sundays, so we got to be able to do that.\u201d\n\nGruden insisted Monday that he likes this team and is sure it will start winning.\n\n\u201cWe have a good skill set in house,\u201d he said before adding: \u201cI think we\u2019re a tough, physical football team. We just haven\u2019t shown it right now.\u201d\n\n[Boswell: Think the Redskins\u2019 start to the season has been bad? It may be about to get worse.]\n\nHe is optimistic that defensive lineman Jonathan Allen, who missed most of the Eagles game and all of the Cowboys game with a knee sprain, will be able to practice this week. He also hopes tight end Jordan Reed, who has been in the concussion protocol, will be cleared to play by doctors, although he had no update on Reed\u2019s condition. Dunbar, whose sore knee kept him from practicing last week, wasn\u2019t close to playing this past weekend. Moreau, recovering from an ankle injury, was slightly closer to returning. Gruden believes that either Dunbar or Moreau could be back this weekend, allowing the coaches to use more exotic schemes.\n\nMostly, though, he wants the third down defense to be fixed. He wants the pass rush to be a threat. He backed away from a line uttered in frustration on Sunday when he said the defensive coaches aren\u2019t \u201creaching\u201d the players. He said the communication is fine. The defense has to improve.\n\n\u201cOur standards haven\u2019t changed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just got to play harder, demand more.\u201d\n\nRead more on the Washington Redskins:\n\nTrent Williams\u2019s holdout enters third week of Redskins\u2019 season, with no end in sight\n\nHail or Fail: After Cowboys shred Redskins defense, Josh Norman rants against the media\n\nRedskins may have a potential star in Terry McLaurin, but rest of playmakers have been lacking\n\nToo many near-misses doom the Redskins in a frustrating loss to the Cowboys", "description": "Gruden said Washington's pass rush must improve, but also blamed its coverage and a lack of \"exotic looks\" to confuse opponents.", "authors": ["Les Carpenter", "Reporter Covering Washington Redskins", "September At Pm", "Les Carpenter Returned To The Washington Post In", "Writes About The Washington Redskins."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Oq8FfE35ZUfGKmZiuEwSbHjW9q0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YO7ZWRWYVYI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
