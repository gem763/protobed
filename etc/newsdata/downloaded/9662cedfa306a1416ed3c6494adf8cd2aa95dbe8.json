And that is the case\".\n\nTwelve months after the US pulled out of the nuclear deal, Iran began reducing its commitments under the accord.\n\nThe UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Friday that just over 10 percent of Iran's uranium stockpile was now enriched up to 4.5 percent, above the 3.67 percent limit stipulated in the 2015 deal.\n\nIt also said Iran's total stockpile of uranium, which under the accord should be no more than the equivalent of 300 kilograms (661 pounds) of uranium hexafluoride, now stood at roughly 360 kilograms.\n\nIran has not specified what its third step might be in reducing its commitments to the deal.\n\nForeign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Tuesday in an interview with the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper that the step would be taken on September 6.\n\nRouhani's chief of staff Mahmoud Vaezi said the third step would be taken \"in the event Iran's demands are not met\".\n\n\"A committee decides the third step and we will decide... two or three days prior to the deadline,\" he said late Saturday, quoted by state news agency IRNA.\n\nVaezi said Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi would head an Iranian economic delegation travelling to France on Monday to discuss proposals aimed at salvaging the nuclear deal.\n\nMacron has urged the US to offer some sort of relief to Iran, such as lifting sanctions on oil sales to China and India, or a new credit line to enable exports in return for its compliance with the nuclear deal.", "description": "President Hassan Rouhani spoke with French counterpart Emmanuel Macron on Saturday, warning him Iran would take the next step in reducing its nuclear commitments unless Europe lives up to its own undertakings.
