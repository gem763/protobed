According to a criminal complaint filed in the U.S. District Court of Kansas, the Army solider spoke with an undercover FBI agent on the Telegram messenger app, where he relayed instructions on how to make \"a Middle East style bomb.\"\n\nJarrett William Smith, a 24-year old private first class infantry soldier stationed at Fort Riley, Kansas, was charged with one count of distributing information related to explosives and weapons of mass destruction.\n\nSmith joined the Army on June 12, 2017 and was transferred to Fort Riley on July 8, 2019.\n\nIn this Feb. 9, 2015 file photo, an honor guard stands at the entrance before ribbon cutting ceremonies for the new 1st Infantry Division Headquarters at Fort Riley, Kan. Prosecutors say a U.S. Army infantry soldier stationed at Fort Riley shared bomb-making instructions online and also discussed killing activists and bombing a news network. AP\n\nProsecutors allege Smith discussed his plan to kill far-left-leaning \"antifa\" activists and described how to build a bomb that could be triggered by calling a cellphone. Smith reportedly said on Facebook that he wanted to travel to Ukraine to fight with a paramilitary group known as Azov Battalion.\n\nSmith also suggested targeting a major news network with a car bomb, though the news network was not identified in the complaint. Smith appeared to be targeting former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke as well, according to prosecutors. O'Rourke is currently running for president in the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\"You got anyone down in Texas that would be a good fit for fire, destruction and death?\" the undercover FBI agent allegedly asked Smith.\n\n\"Outside of Beto? I don't know enough people that would be relevant enough to cause a change if they died,\" Smith said allegedly.\n\nBeto O'Rourke seen September 12, 2019, in Houston.

This isn't about any one person or one campaign and we won't let this scare us or cause us to back down in fighting for what's right.\"\n\nSmith was arrested Saturday. In an interview before his arrest, Smith told investigators he knew how to make improvised explosive devices and routinely provided instruction on building them. He stated he did this to cause \"chaos.\"\n\nSmith could face up to to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 if he is convicted. The FBI investigated the case, while U.S. Attorney Tony Mattivi will prosecute.", "description": "Jarrett William Smith, a 24-year old private first class infantry soldier, was charged by the Justice Department in Kansas on Monday", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/23/bad603fa-38d5-48e3-9f82-90f751500f2d/thumbnail/1200x630/1266ba9364cdecffdfe64e834285979f/jarret-william-smith.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
