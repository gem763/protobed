Adam Schiff illegally made up a FAKE & terrible statement, pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the Ukrainian President, and read it aloud to Congress and the American people. It bore NO relationship to what I said on the call. Arrest for Treason?\" Trump wrote in a post on Twitter.\n\nTrump appeared to reference statements made by Schiff during a hearing held by the House Intelligence Committee, of which Schiff is the chairman. Schiff said his remarks parodied Trump's comments on the call with Zelenskiy.\n\nThe Republican president has increasingly lashed out at political opponents since House Democrats announced on Tuesday they would pursue an impeachment inquiry.\n\nHe likened the whistleblower and White House officials who gave information to the whistleblower to spies and suggested they committed treason.\n\nThe inspector general for the director of national intelligence deemed the whistleblower complaint credible and urgent, while the top U.S. intelligence officer said the whistleblower acted in good faith.\n\n(This story deletes extraneous character in paragraph 2.)\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Makini Brice and Doina Chiacu; Editing by Catherine Evans and Chizu Nomiyama)", "description": "The comment is likely to inflame criticism of Trump's handling of the scandal engulfing his presidency, stemming from a telephone call in which Trump asked Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden and his son.
