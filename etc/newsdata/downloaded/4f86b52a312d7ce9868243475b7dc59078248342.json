The PKK is designated a \"terrorist\" organisation by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. But unline Ankara, Washington and Brussels do not consider the YPG and its political wing - the Democratic Union Party - as \"terrorist\" groups.\n\nSince the launch of the operation, Turkey and its allied Syrian rebel forces have secured a number of villages along the border region, according to the Turkish authorities.\n\nHowever, the town of Ras al-Ain has held out, with battles raging on Wednesday.\n\nAl Jazeera reporters along the border said heavy gunfire and artillery fire was heard across the city amid a \"fierce\" battle for its control, with Kurdish fighters burning tyres in a bid to blind Turkey's fighter jets and digging in against a ground offensive by Turkish-backed Syrian rebels.\n\n\"The fighting today in Ras al-Ain has been intense,\" said Al Jazeera's Charles Stratford, reporting from Ceylanpinar on the Turkey-Syria border. \"The situation is incredibly tense.\"\n\nSmoke rises over Ras al-Ain, as seen from the Turkish border town of Ceylanpinar [Murad Sezer/Reuters]\n\nAs Turkey's military operation entered its second week, US President Donald Trump was due on Wednesday to dispatch his deputy Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Ankara, in a visit that comes days after imposing sanctions on Turkey over its offensive.\n\n191014165613108\n\nPence's office said he would meet Erdogan on Thursday and \"voice the United States' commitment to reach an immediate ceasefire and the conditions for a negotiated settlement\". Robert O'Brien, the US national security adviser, is already in the Turkish capital for lower-level meetings before the arrival of Pence and Pompeo.\n\nBut Ankara has consistently rebuffed foreign pressure to curb its offensive.\n\nSpeaking in Parliament on Wednesday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said threats and sanctions were unacceptable and pledged that Ankara would retaliate against the US move.\n\nCavusoglu also said Turkey expected the US Congress to turn back from its \"damaging approach\", and added that ties between Ankara and Washington were at a critical juncture.", "description": "Turkish leader rejects international pressure, promises operation will continue until his country's goals are met.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/16/759bfe5f7da14839a097d136b6f7433d_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
