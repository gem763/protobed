Ilhan Omar (D-MN) expressed her frustration at the House Republicans who barged into a closed-door hearing on Wednesday, demanding more transparency in the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry into President Trump, because they violated the rules.\n\nSpeaking on The Intercept's \"Deconstructed\" podcast with Michael Moore, Omar said it was obnoxious for House members, lead by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), to not have faced punishment so far for entering the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) with their cell phones, which is against protocol.\n\n\"It is obnoxious to me that none of them were arrested or are going to find themselves in trouble for the security breach that they did,\" Omar said.\n\n\"You think they should be arrested?\" podcast host Mehdi Hasan asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Omar replied. \"It took an hour and a half to re-secure that room, while they still refused to leave. The idea that somebody would go into a room like that with their cell phone still on them, realizing how sensitive the information that is in that room is, is obnoxious.\"\n\nFox News reported there was never really a chance for the Republicans who went into the Capitol Hill SCIF to be arrested, even though some hoped they would and be walked out in handcuffs so it could help their argument that House Democrats are abusing the impeachment inquiry process. It is still possible for the congressmen who violated the SCIF rules to be referred to the House Ethics Committee.\n\nRepublicans entered the room as House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) was about to give his opening statement for Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary Laura Cooper's testimony.\n\n\"GOP members tried to get in to view documents, staff tried to prevent them, but Reps. Gaetz, [Andy] Biggs and, [Paul] Gosar went past staff, and the rest of the members followed into the room. Shouting commenced, and members chanted, 'Shame!' They were then made to leave, denied access to transcripts,\" a source who was present during the incident told Townhall.", "description": ".10/24/2019 12:25:49PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien", "Leah Barkoukis", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/106/814316fd-6408-4e6b-881e-ca393771aca1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
