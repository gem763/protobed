REFILE-Asia Rice-Indian prices slip on weak African demand; strong baht hurts Thai exports\n\n(Refiles to include dropped word in lede)\n\n* Muted demand for Indian rice despite price correction\n\n* Vietnamese rice rates edge up from 12-year low\n\n* Exporters in Vietnam benefit from higher Thai rates\n\n* Dhaka considering providing subsidy to farmers\n\nBy Karthika Suresh Namboothiri\n\nBENGALURU, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Indian rice export prices slipped this week as demand from Africa was subdued, while shipments from Thailand remained sluggish due to a strong baht.\n\nPrices of 5% broken parboiled variety RI-INBKN5-P1 in top exporter India were quoted at around $371-$375 per tonne this week, down from $373-$379 a week ago.\n\nDemand from African countries has been muted for the last few weeks, even as export prices have corrected, said an exporter based at Kakinada in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.\n\nIndia's rice exports plunged 26.5% in April-July from a year ago to 3.14 million tonnes, a government body said earlier this month. Thailand, a strong baht THB=TH , Asia's best performing currency in 2019, has kept away potential buyers who find cheaper markets elsewhere, such as in Vietnam. Thai exporters have struggled to sell the staple since the beginning of the year.\n\nThe country's benchmark 5-percent broken rice RI-THBKN5-P1 prices were quoted at $400-$420 a tonne on Thursday, compared to $400-$418 last week.\n\n\"The price is only fluctuating due to the exchange rate at the moment as both demand and supply remain unchanged,\" a Bangkok-based trader said.\n\nConcerns over supply also persist due to floods in northeastern Thailand that have damaged agricultural land, including some rice-growing areas. This has not had an immediate impact on prices though, traders said.\n\n\"Buyers seem to be heading to Vietnam as Thai prices are a lot higher,\" a trader based in Ho Chi Minh City said.\n\n\"We think that prices have bottomed and that domestic supplies have gone low as the summer-autumn harvest has ended.\"\n\nIn Vietnam, rates for 5% broken rice RI-VNBKN5-P1 rose to $335 a tonne on Thursday from $325 a week earlier, which was its lowest since November 2007.\n\nPreliminary data showed at least 37,100 tonnes of rice is scheduled to be loaded at Ho Chi Minh City ports during Oct. 1-9, with most of the shipments bound for West Africa and Malaysia, according to traders.\n\nMeanwhile, Bangladesh is considering providing a subsidy to farmers, who suffered a double blow of low rice prices and high harvesting costs, in an effort to reduce production costs and boost domestic output, Agriculture Minister Abdur Razzaque told Reuters on Thursday.\n\n\"To make it profitable, we must use more machinery because the labour price is very high. We'll provide (a) subsidy to help farmers buy modern machinery so that they minimize labour costs for production,\" he said.\n\nDhaka has been unable to clinch overseas deals since a long-standing export ban was lifted in May as its rice is more expensive than India's or Thailand's, despite a recent fall in local prices.", "description": "REFILE-Asia Rice-Indian prices slip on weak African demand; strong baht hurts Thai exports", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB6T15I_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
