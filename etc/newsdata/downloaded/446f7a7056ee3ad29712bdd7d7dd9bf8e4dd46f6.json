Under the law, UACs are supposed to be placed with family or foster care sponsors as quickly as possible, but that turns out to work against the mental health needs.\n\n\u201cMental health clinicians described intentionally not probing into past events, but instead staying focused on helping children to cope and remain stable,\u201d the auditors found. \u201cMental health clinicians referred to this as a \u2018Band-Aid\u2019 approach, akin to psychological first aid; the goal is not to treat children\u2019s underlying issues because children will not be in the facility long enough to make meaningful progress.\u201d\n\nSome of the mental health professionals said the children\u2019s trauma was so high that despite their own training, they weren\u2019t prepared. Clinicians even reported facing their own mental distress from having to hear about the horrific conditions some of the children had faced during their travels.\n\nDemocrats were eager to blame President Trump.\n\n\u201cThese reports validate what we have long known, the Trump administration\u2019s cruel and chaotic immigration policies are taking a damning toll on children and their mental health,\u201d said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, Mississippi Democrat and chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee.\n\nHe said his panel has a hearing scheduled for later this month to examine children\u2019s health and safety in connection with the border crisis.\n\nThe report says the administration\u2019s policies did exacerbate matters.\n\nOne boy \u2014 he was either 7 or 8 years old, the investigators weren\u2019t sure \u2014 was separated from his father without explanation, and developed a delusion that his father had been killed and came to believe he too would be killed, the report said. The boy needed emergency psychiatric care.\n\nBut the end of the separations also led to trauma, the report said, as the shelters tried to figure out how to comply with a court order to reunite the children.\n\n\u201cFor example, case managers in facilities were not always able to let children know when, or even if, they would be reunified with their parents, or whether that reunification would happen in the United States. This type of uncertainty added to the distress and mental health needs of separated children,\u201d the auditors said.\n\nThe children who did need help for their stress also distracted the facilities from caring for other children, the audit found.\n\nFederal health officials, in their response to the report, said many of the problems identified are beyond their control, including the surge of migrant children that overwhelmed government facilities, and the unique type of trauma illegal immigrant children face when sent on a terrifying journey without parents.\n\nStill, the health officials said they\u2019ve already taken steps to try to alleviate some of the problems, including cutting the amount of time children are in custody from an average of 93 days in November 2018 to 48 days in April.\n\nIn short, children are being pushed out of government care and into sponsors\u2019 hands as fast as ever.\n\nHHS said it also hired a board-certified psychiatrist to lead a mental health team for the migrant children.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
