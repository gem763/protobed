Standard screening procedures revealed the presence of pathogens on infants in the intensive care unit which they then tracked to the washing machine.\n\nLeftover water lurking in the machine\u2019s rubber seal was thought to be contaminating babies\u2019 socks and knitted caps. The final rinsing process, which runs unheated, detergent-free water through the clothes, could also be spreading hostile bacteria.\n\nThe research, published in Applied and Environmental Microbiology, warns that microorganisms can also persist in domestic washing machines at reduced temperatures.\n\n\u201cIf elderly people requiring nursing care with open wounds or bladder catheters, or younger people with suppurating injuries or infections live in the household, laundry should be washed at higher temperatures, or with efficient disinfectants, to avoid transmission of dangerous pathogens,\u201d said Martin Exner, chair and director of the Institute for Hygiene and Public Health.\n\n\u201cThis is a growing challenge for hygienists, as the number of people receiving nursing care from family members is constantly increasing,\u201d he said.", "description": "\u201cEnergy-saving\u201d\u00a0wash cycles could spread germs, new research suggests.
