This new version of Windows is optimized to work with dual-screen devices, such as the Surfaces Neo and Duo, also announced at the same event.\n\nWindows 10X was introduced in tandem with the new Surface Neo, Microsoft\u2019s dual-screen device, and presumably it\u2019ll also work with the Surface Duo phone, also revealed at the event. According to Microsoft, it allows all apps to make the best of both screens, or, as they put it, \u201cto fuel a new era of productivity and creativity across two screens.\u201d\n\nApplications can be \u201cspanned\u201d across two screens, optimizing the layout so that it\u2019ll work on both. It\u2019ll also reflow the layout depending on your screen orientation. Whenever you open an app, it\u2019ll snap to the screen you used to summon it, but if you drag the app to the divide between the two screens, it\u2019ll automatically span both screens. The Start Menu is fresh as well. It has an attractive search bar and a selection of pinned apps, and can be opened from either screen.\n\nWindows 10X also readjusts as you manipulate the screens \u2014 for example, it\u2019ll recognize the Surface keyboard when you snap it over one of the screens. When you do this, it turns the part of the screen not covered by the keys into a \u201cWonderbar,\u201d which includes a trackpad.\n\nWe didn\u2019t get a release date on Windows 10X, but presumably it\u2019ll be available Holiday 2020, the same time as the Surface Neo and Duo. Microsoft also said they want to get it into developers\u2019 hands as soon as possible.\n\nCheck out all of the news from today\u2019s Microsoft Surface event here.\n\nRead next: Microsoft announces the Surface Neo, the dual-screen PC of the future", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FWindows-10X.jpg&signature=136cb9bdbcfab4d9567185d7502bdc90", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
