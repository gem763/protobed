Americans see work requirements as one important way for welfare programs to merge compassion and fairness.\n\nAmericans also broadly recognize work as a fundamental source of well-being in their own lives.\n\nMost report that work gives them a sense of identity, as opposed to being something they just do for a living. In fact, more than two-thirds say that they would work in a paying job even if they didn\u2019t need the money.\n\nJob satisfaction has been consistently high (at around 90 percent) since Gallup started polling on it in the early 1990s.\n\nThese positive feelings toward work should come as no surprise.\n\nAs social psychologist Jonathan Haidt describes in his book \u201cThe Happiness Hypothesis,\u201d humans have a \u201cbasic drive to make this happen,\u201d and one way this commonly manifests itself is through work.\n\nIn other words, work empowers us to connect and engage productively with our environments, and thus provides us with a sense of meaning and purpose.\n\nYet despite the inherent value of work, the government\u2019s current means-tested programs generally do little to promote work. Instead, these programs often discourage work by reducing benefits as recipients earn more income.\n\nLast year, the White House Council of Economic Advisers reported that most recipients of means-tested assistance who are capable of work actually work few hours or not at all.\n\nEven in the program at the core of the successful 1996 welfare reform, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, nearly half of work-capable individuals currently are idle, neither working nor preparing for work.\n\nLow levels of work keep people from achieving their full potential.\n\nFor example, an additional year of employment for a low-skilled adult aged 18-35 boosts his long-term future wages by 4 percent, on average. Less work, therefore, undermines his earnings capacity and ability to flourish.\n\nYet recent calls for expansive policies such as universal basic income are completely devoid of work provisions. The now-deleted FAQ page for the left\u2019s Green New Deal promised \u201ceconomic security\u201d for those who are \u201cunwilling to work.\u201d\n\nAdvocates of universal basic income, which guarantees cash payments to everyone regardless of need, often cheer the fact that the idea decouples work from income.\n\nHowever, we know from social psychology and public opinion that work has value in and of itself. Dismissing this basic idea\u2014and failing to apply it to public programs\u2014would be a damaging development.\n\nThe Trump administration is right to focus on work in its new budget proposal.\n\nIn addition to strengthening work in TANF and food stamps, Congress and the administration should consider reforms proposed by The Heritage Foundation to go further. A good place to start: Reform the earned income tax credit to increase work incentives.\n\nThe earned income tax credit is a broadly supported program that rewards work among low-income earners. Congress should reform the credit to encourage work more effectively, namely by linking the credit to hours worked, as well as to reduce fraud and marriage penalties.\n\nOur policies must do more to promote work for those who are able to work. The Trump administration is doing its part, calling in its budget outline for \u201cbold proposals to help able-bodied adults \u2026 enter the job market and work toward self-sufficiency.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s budget proposal offers a great start toward advancing a vision of greater self-reliance and human flourishing.", "description": "President Donald Trump issued an\u00a0executive order\u00a0last April that called for policy reforms to, among other things, \u201cimprove employment outcomes and economic independence.\u201d", "authors": ["Vijay Menon", "Former Research Assistant", "Domestic Policy Studies", "Vijay Was A Research Assistant For Domestic Policy Studies At The Heritage Foundation."], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-03/GettyImages-1129709495.jpg?itok=Nu9S4G8L"}
