(Picture: ITV/Rex)\n\nCraig Revel Horwood has hit out at James Jordan after he slammed the Strictly Come Dancing judges\u2019 decision to axe Dev Griffin from the show last weekend.\n\nThe 54-year-old panellist has claimed that the dancing pro is \u2018just out for the publicity\u2019 after he and his three fellow judges \u2013 Motsi Mabuse, Shirley Ballas, and Bruno Tonioli, all opted to send the Radio 1 DJ home following his and Dianne Buswell\u2019s dance-off against Viscountess Emma Weymouth and Aljaz Skorjanec.\n\nJames later shot to the defence of Dev and Dianne and claimed the judging was \u2018all over the place\u2019 and he even branded them \u2018liars\u2019.\n\nAlthough Craig has now hit back at James and said that Dev was the worst dancer on the night and they did make the right decision.\n\nHe said: \u2018James Jordan is just out for publicity and if he was on the judging panel, I\u2019m telling you looking at it you have to judge on what you see.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Was Dev the right person to go on the night? Yes. Would he have been better in the future? Yes. Was he better in the past? Yes.\n\n\u2018He just got a dance he wasn\u2019t particularly good at and he made a mistake.\n\nDev and Dianne were eliminated (Picture: BBC)\n\n\u2018Dev was the worst dancer on the night but if he had done his other routines then he may have been successful going through.\u2019\n\nCraig also took a swipe at fans of the show who were up in arms about Dev\u2019s axing, insisting they know \u2018nothing\u2019 about dancing the cha cha cha.\n\nSpeaking at the Best Heroes Awards, he told the Daily Mirror: \u2018They can kick off as much as they like.\n\n\u2018How much do they know about the cha cha cha? Nothing darling \u2026 so they can kick off.\u2019\n\nThe Strictly Come Dancing Judges decided to send Dev home\n\nAfter Dev and Dianne were eliminated from the show, James admitted he felt \u2018irritate by the judges\u2019 and claimed to axe the pair was \u2018a bit of a farce\u2019.\n\nHe said: \u2018I loved all of the dancing this week, but I was just irritated by the judges. It was such a great show, but we were disappointed that Dev and Dianne are gone! It happens every year, to be fair. Dev had so much to give. He was brilliant in my opinion.\n\n\u2018I felt the show itself did its job, the pros did their job, the celebrities did their job, but the judges didn\u2019t do their job. It was a bit of a farce.\n\nJames Jordan has branded the Strictly judges \u2018liars\u2019 Picture: Matt Frost/ITV/REX)\n\n\u2018The wrong person this evening is gone. It comes from the judging being all over the place. I mean, David and Nadiya with 28 points in front of five other couples. It\u2019s impossible.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe star also took to Twitter to share his shock at the decision.\n\nHe tweeted: \u2018How dare the judges say they are truly shocked!!! Liars!!! And it\u2019s your fault! Fact!\n\n\u2018Why can people not be more honest in the world\u2026\n\n\u2018The public have been watching long enough to call bull****!\n\n\u2018Just mark what you see and then let the public decide\u2026just do your job!\u2019\n\nStrictly Come Dancing continues on Saturday at 6.40pm on BBC One and BBC iPlayer.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
