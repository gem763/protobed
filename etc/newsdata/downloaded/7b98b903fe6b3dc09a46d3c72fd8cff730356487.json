Not a single scripted series from a major US broadcast network won an Emmy on Sunday.\n\nPrime Video ruled the comedy categories. \"Fleabag\" won the awards for best comedy series, actress in a comedy series, and more. \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" won two supporting acting Emmys.\n\nNetflix's \"Ozark,\" \"When They See Us,\" and \"Black Mirror: Bandersnatch\" took home major prizes, as did FX's \"Pose,\" the first season of which is available to stream on Netflix.\n\nBut HBO was the biggest winner of the night, with nine Emmys on Sunday and 34 overall (including the Creative Arts Emmys last week). \"Game of Thrones\" won best drama series and \"Chernobyl\" won best limited series.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of where to stream every TV show that won an Emmy on Sunday:", "description": "Nearly every Emmy winner this year can be watched on Netflix, Hulu, HBO, or Amazon Prime Video as streaming dominates television.", "authors": ["Travis Clark"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d88fcd72e22af1d677df2e7-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
