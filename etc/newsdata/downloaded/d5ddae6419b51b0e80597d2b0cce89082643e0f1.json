Through the use of DNA samples, authorities are working to identify the victims and determine if they match any missing person cases, El Universal reports.\n\nBreitbart Texas reported last week on a large-scale raid targeting the Union de Tepito where more than 700 police and military forces arrested 31 suspects, seized several tons of drugs, and found two labs. Authorities also found a weapons cache which included a rocket launcher and grenades.\n\nThe raid targeted the operations of the ruling cartel in Mexico City. The group\u2019s current leader, \u201cEl Lunares,\u201d escaped. Authorities believe he was tipped off moments before the raid. Several local, high-level policemen are currently under investigation for their alleged ties with the cartel.\n\nSoon after, a federal judge ordered the release of 27 of the 31 suspects, claiming their arrests were illegal involving fabricated evidence to develop the investigation.\n\nIldefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.
