Danh says her sister loves the outdoors and that her injuries may make it hard for her to climb, one of her favourite activities.

She studied to be a mechanic and worked in several local garages before moving to B.C.\n\nBefore the collision, she was a server at the Shark Club Sports Bar & Grill in Vancouver, Danh said.\n\n\"She's hard-working, free-spirited and loves the outdoors,\" said Danh.\n\n\"One of Desiree's favourite things to do is to climb a tree and read in it. Mobility issues will make it hard for her to climb, but I think what will be more difficult is adjusting to a new face,\" Danh said.\n\nEvancio will now require facial reconstruction surgery because of the severity of her injuries, Danh said, and will lose her right eye as well as mobility in one of her arms.\n\n\"Her face was taken from her,\" she said.\n\nVancouver police say Desiree Evancio was walking downtown when she was struck by a white van and became trapped underneath.

Steve Addison.\n\nEvancio suffered trauma to her face and limbs in the crash, her sister said. (Submitted by Ashley Danh )\n\nAddison said impaired driving may have been a factor.\n\n\"At this point we do believe that alcohol may have played a role in the collision, but we are conducting further investigation to determine the circumstances of the event,\" he said.\n\nWhile no charges have been laid, police contionue to investigate.", "description": "Desiree Evancio will require facial reconstruction surgery and is facing a lengthy recovery after she was hit and\u00a0dragged by a van in downtown Vancouver.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5329410.1571703146!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/van-collision-desiree-evancio.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
