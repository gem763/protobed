Forgive me for not remembering who said that. This was several hours into switching back and forth between the debate and the Montreal Canadiens vs. Tampa Bay Lightning. It may have been Steven Stamkos.\n\nWhoever it was, he\u2019s almost certainly right. But they\u2019d better all be getting better. Most have been running for the greater part of a year. Businessman Andrew Yang \u2014 campaign theme: MATH (Make America Think Harder) \u2014 announced on Feb. 2, 2018. In the admittedly remote chance he makes it all the way to election day, Nov. 3, 2020, he will have been running for 1,005 days, almost as long as the entire Kennedy administration. He has been at it 20 months already.\n\nA long audition is a very useful gauntlet\n\nIf you spend a good part of every day answering questions about why you want to be president, what you want to do as president and what you think about any of a thousand things \u2014 \u201cName a friend you have that people would be surprised to hear about\u201d was the final question Tuesday night \u2014 then if you don\u2019t get better at it, you\u2019d better get out, as several underperforming Democrats have already done. In another series of questions, the septuagenarian candidates, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, just back from a heart attack, were asked whether they had the stamina to be president. None gave the obvious answer, which is: Just watch me! If I can make it through the campaign, I can handle the presidency.\n\nYou don\u2019t actually order troops around or send off squadrons of drones as a presidential candidate but you\u2019ve got to put together a multimillion-dollar organization capable of quick thinking and instant response and, though you\u2019re running for chief executive, not chief legislator, you\u2019ve got to present a plausible policy platform. It\u2019s a gruelling marathon (unlike all those non-gruelling marathons). But it does weed people out. Sen. Kamala Harris, a one-time media favourite, may be in the process of weeding herself out with her suggestion that Twitter should close Donald Trump\u2019s account on the grounds he has been intimidating potential impeachment witnesses, which is a crime. Even her CNN questioners seemed doubtful. Not all voters are looking for judgment, of course \u2014 otherwise Trump would not be president \u2014 but for those who are, a long audition is a very useful gauntlet.\n\nFor her part, Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s free ride on whether going to Canada-style single-payer medicare would cause Canada-style high middle-class taxes appears to be over. She says she doesn\u2019t want to say because the Republicans would use her answer against her in the general election. But that\u2019s a curious way to do bold social policy. You don\u2019t talk about its true costs now because you don\u2019t want to talk about them during the general election, either. It\u2019s almost Trumpian in its gall. (Recall that Trump is the candidate who in 2016 criticized Mitt Romney for not releasing his tax returns early enough in the 2012 campaign to get the inevitable bad public reaction behind him but then didn\u2019t release his own tax returns at all, presumably because they were so bad he could never do it early enough.)\n\nAs our own election campaign winds down almost all commentators are saying what a relief it is that it\u2019s over and how dreary it has been\n\nAs our own election campaign winds down almost all commentators are saying what a relief it is that it\u2019s over and how dreary it has been. It did start badly, with daily character assassination attempts, especially by the Liberals, based on unwise things other parties\u2019 candidates had said on social media \u2014 which should cause all sensible people to wonder if they really, really need to be on social media. That onslaught stopped when the blackface photos came out. (For a terrific discussion of what we should and shouldn\u2019t learn from them, see Peter Shawn Taylor\u2019s new article in C2C Journal.) After that there has been lots of focus on both policy and the horse race. Unfortunately, the focus on policy is also largely a horse race: which party has the most generous offerings for which interest groups?\n\nIn terms of policy debate, Canadians who speak one language and didn\u2019t want to listen to translators \u2014 who would? \u2014 had just two hours of exposure to six party leaders, which boils down to 20 minutes per leader, minus talking by moderators. The leaders of the three major parties each spoke between 3,800 and 4,000 words, which is the length of just five newspaper columns like this one. Not very much on which to base a decision whether to entrust the nation\u2019s governance to a person.\n\nThe last thing we need is more electoral law. But if parties had to introduce their full platform in the campaign\u2019s first week and then defend it in a series of debates over the following three weeks, Canadians could develop the kind of familiarity with the issues and candidates that many U.S. Democrats are gradually gaining.", "description": "Maybe we should take a page from America\u2019s gruelling marathon", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/advance-poll.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
