Bernie Sanders of Vermont, 78, was hospitalized in Las Vegas, Nevada, due to chest discomfort and has canceled all 2020 campaign events indefinitely.\n\nIn a statement released on Wednesday, Sanders' senior adviser Jeff Weaver said: \"During a campaign event yesterday evening, Sen. Sanders experienced some chest discomfort. Following medical evaluation and testing he was found to have a blockage in one artery and two stents were successfully inserted. Sen. Sanders is conversing and in good spirits. He will be resting up over the next few days.\"\n\nWeaver added, \"We are canceling his events and appearances until further notice, and we will continue to provide appropriate updates.\"\n\nHours after the news of his hospitalization broke, Sanders took to Twitter to assure supporters he's OK. He also used it as an opportunity to pivot to and tout his Medicare for All plan.\n\n\"Thanks for all the well wishes. I'm feeling good. I'm fortunate to have good health care and great doctors and nurses helping me to recover,\" Sanders said. \"None of us know when a medical emergency might affect us.

I'm feeling good. I'm fortunate to have good health care and great doctors and nurses helping me to recover.\n\n\n\nNone of us know when a medical emergency might affect us. And no one should fear going bankrupt if it occurs. Medicare for All!\n\nThe top three candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, which includes Sanders, are septuagenarians. Former Vice President Joe Biden is 76 and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is 70. The issue of age has come up at times and been a point of controversy. After former HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro challenged Biden on whether he'd forgotten what he said a few moments ago during the most recent presidential primary debate, for example, some pundits accused him of ageism.\n\nSanders has dismissed concerns about his age along the campaign trail.\n\nWhen asked about it during an interview in February, Sanders said, \"We have got to look at candidates, you know, not by the color of their skin, not by their sexual orientation or their gender, and not by their age. I mean, I think we have got to try to move us toward a nondiscriminatory society, which looks at people based on their abilities, based on what they stand for.\"\n\n\"I have been very blessed in my life with good health,\" Sanders continued, adding: \"I'm very lucky that as a kid I was a long-distance runner, and I think I had and still have a great deal of energy. So I would ask people to look at the totality of who I am \u2014 my energy level, my record in the US Senate \u2014 and not just at one criterion.\"\n\nPrior to launching his campaign, Sanders last October told Politico that his age would \"obviously\" be a \"factor\" if he ultimately decided to run.\n\nRead more: Warren is pulling ahead of Biden and starting to look like the 2020 Democratic frontrunner\n\nDespite his age, Sanders is particularly popular with young voters: A mid-September NBC/Wall Street Journal survey showed that a third of voters under 35 supported him. Comparatively, Warren, who led Biden by roughly two-to-one among liberals and Democrats under 35, drew 25% of the vote from this demographic.\n\nFollowing the news of his hospitalization, other 2020 candidates wished Sanders a swift recovery.\n\nBiden tweeted, \"@DrBiden and I are sending our best wishes to @BernieSanders, Jane, and the whole Sanders family. Anyone who knows Bernie understands what a force he is. We are confident that he will have a full and speedy recovery and look forward to seeing him on the trail soon.\"\n\nSimilarly, Warren tweeted, \"Bruce, Team Warren, and I are sending all our best wishes for a speedy recovery to @BernieSanders. I hope to see my friend back on the campaign trail very soon.\"\n\nNOW WATCH: Why the US border facilities are 'concentration camps,' according to historians", "description": "Sen.
