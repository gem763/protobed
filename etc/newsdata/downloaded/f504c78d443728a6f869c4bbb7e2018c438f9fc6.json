It was an experience I'll never forget, I loved every second of it.\n\n\"I didn't feel like there was any pressure at all being there which is why I enjoyed it so much, which is why it was such a memorable thing because I wasn't going there to win.\n\n\"I just wanted to get there and perform in Wembley Arena and be back on BGT. In all honesty the reaction I got from the crowd was so nice and so lovely it far exceeded my expectations.\"", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The former solider, 29, made the jack of hearts transform into the eight of diamonds before our very eyes", "authors": ["Molly Pike", "Image", "Itv", "Splash News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20396368.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SycoThames.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
