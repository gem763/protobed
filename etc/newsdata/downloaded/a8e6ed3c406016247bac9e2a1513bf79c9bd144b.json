And he actually said that stress is becoming a bigger and bigger crisis everywhere,\" Huffington told CNBC's \"The Brave Ones.\"\n\n\"And then he ended\u2026by saying: 'And if you decide to do that, I'll invest in it.' And at the time, I really thought he was crazy. I really thought (The Huffington Post) was going to be my last act. I loved it like a third child.\"\n\nHuffington had noticed that content about sleep and work performance, as well as articles about stress and screen reduction time, did well online. \"Increasingly, all these subjects began to bring us more traffic than our coverage of politics. So, I could see that the world was hungry for this conversation,\" she said.\n\nIn 2016, Huffington stepped down as editor-in-chief of her online publication and launched Thrive Global, a media company and consultancy that helps corporations with their employees' overall wellbeing, and Ma and Alibaba co-founder Joseph Tsai invested an undisclosed amount.\n\nThrive has since worked with companies such as Accenture, JPMorgan and SAP, and it has published articles by the likes of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who wrote about sleep, and pop star Selena Gomez, who discussed digital detoxing.\n\n\"These role models give permission to people to make these changes in their lives without feeling that if they take their foot off the accelerator for 10 minutes to meditate or to go for a walking meeting they are somehow going to fall behind,\" Huffington told \"The Brave Ones.\"\n\nHuffington sold The Huffington Post to AOL for $315 million in 2011. AOL became part of Verizon in 2015.", "description": "In 2016, Huffington stepped down as editor-in-chief of her online publication and launched Thrive Global, a media company and consultancy that helps corporations with their employees' overall wellbeing.", "authors": ["Lucy Handley"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105983625-1561343138848gettyimages-971094292.jpeg?v=1564004198", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
