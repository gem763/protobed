Update: Sunshine makes a comeback on a warm Tuesday", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nStarry skies over Lake Anne in Reston. (Kit Case/Flickr)\n\nClouds failed to keep us all that cool Monday, with highs rising into the 80s most spots. Warm is the story ahead, so perhaps it\u2019s fitting. We see sunshine return with vengeance Tuesday on another warm but not hot day. After that, temperatures are on the way back toward summerlike levels. Kicking the warm season out of here is always one of the hardest jobs of the year.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough Tonight: It\u2019s not impossible a shower or two rolls by during the evening, but most folks stay dry. Parts of the area could be in for a nice sunset as some breaks enter the picture. With time, skies should start to clear. Lows range across the 60s overall, but that could be a 70 downtown. Winds are out of the north-northeast about 5 to 10 mph.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Tuesday): Some clouds may linger into the morning, but we should see increased sun as the day progresses, and we probably finish mostly sunny. As the sun comes out, temperatures head upward. Highs make the low- and mid-80s most spots. Winds should flip to the south, about 5 to 10 mph.\n\nSee Jason Samenow\u2019s forecast through the weekend.

Mold spores are low/moderate. Tree pollen is low.\n\nFall is coming, maybe: We\u2019ve had only one day at or above 90 degrees so far in September. That might seem typical, considering we\u2019re headed out of summer, but the city averages three such days per September. Despite the fact that our last 90-degree day comes around the 11th on average, it looks as if we may be seeing some past that date this year. Models are in fairly good agreement of more heat on the way. Let\u2019s also hope the cool-down shown after comes together!\n\n\n\nForecast temperatures from today's GFS weather model run.
