He was roughly twice the size of Loki with a long tail.\n\n\"It was scruffy looking. When you see pictures of panthers and pumas online they all look really nicely brushed, not like that.\n\n\"It made a 'big cat' sound and Loki had all his teeth out - he wasn't backing down.\n\n\"I think his animal instinct kicked in [even though] he knew he was out of his depth.\"\n\n(Image: SWNS.com)\n\nKayleigh said Adam and their seven-year-old son Jacob Holmes, had taken Loki out for a walk at 3pm.\n\nThe mum received a worried call from Adam saying Loki had gone missing for half an hour after he was let off the lead.\n\nKayleigh met with them in a bid to track him down, and it was only when Adam looked down an embankment that he spotted Loki face-to-face with the big cat.\n\nKayleigh said: \"Adam got to the top of a hill and I heard him swear.\n\n\"He picked up a log and threw it down the hill - he wasn't aiming at the cat, just wanted to scare it.\n\n\"The cat looked at Adam and then leapt back into the woods, Loki came running back to Adam.\n\n\"We got Loki in the car to get out of there.\n\n(Image: SWNS.com)\n\n\"We checked him over when we got home. He had the mark on his face, which we cleaned up, and saw that he was struggling to sit and stand up.\n\n\"He was eating, drinking and going to the toilet OK and wasn't whimpering or crying so we waited until Monday morning to take him to the vet and get checked over.\n\n\"Because the cut had healed quite a bit by Monday morning and it didn't look infected, the vet wasn't too concerned about that and said he could have fallen over and hurt his leg.\"\n\nThe vet prescribed an anti-inflammatory medication, which Loki needs to take once a day for a week.\n\nKayleigh said: \"We don't know what happened - some people have said the cut on his face could have been a swipe from the cat, or he could have caught it on barbed wire, I haven't got a clue.\n\n\"It was a bit of a shock, you don't expect something like that to happen.\n\n\"We won't ever be going there again.\"\n\n(Image: James Linsell-Clark/ SWNS)\n\nKayleigh wrote a warning on social media urging other dog walkers to be careful in the area.\n\nHer post reads: \"WARNING PEOPLE - we took our dog to the outskirts of wakerley woods today and came across a Black Panther/Puma. It was face to face with our dog!!\n\n\"People who no Loki no he's a big boy the panther, a bloody big black cat with yellow eyes was more than twice his size.\n\n\"We reported it to the police and they said they have had a few reportings of the same thing in that location.\n\n\"We won't ever be going there again.
