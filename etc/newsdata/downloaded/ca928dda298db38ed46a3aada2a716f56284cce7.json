They were invented in the early 1990s by designer John Varvatos, who was then at Calvin Klein. Varvatos cut a pair of long johns and managed to create what is now the most popular kind of underwear for men.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re infinitely better than boxers,\u201d says Derek Guy, editor at men\u2019s style site Put This On and blogger at Die, Workwear. \u201cThey give you support. They don\u2019t bunch up in your pants. And when they\u2019re made from good materials, they just feel nice.\u201d Today, there are hundreds of styles of boxer briefs to choose from. To sort through all the options, we asked 11 menswear experts which ones are the best.\n\nCalvin Klein Stretch Boxer Briefs $30 (was $43, now 30% off) The original Calvin Klein style is still one of the best out there, according to Ian Taylor, the London-based editor-in-chief of men\u2019s style site FashionBeans. He suggests avoiding the Marky Mark look, instead going with a darker color like gray or black. \u201cIn photo shoots, you often see people wearing white, which looks great when it\u2019s well-lit and photographed on a model with a six-pack. But if you\u2019ve been wearing them for six months, they won\u2019t look quite as pristine. Grays and blacks have a bit more of a shelf life.\u201d Phillip Wong, co-founder and creative director of Hawthorne swears by these, too: \u201cI\u2019ve worn only the classic Calvin Klein boxer briefs for as long as I can remember. The shape is exceptional, not too tight, and it\u2019s very low maintenance,\u201d he says. $30 for 3 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nEverlane The Longer Boxer Brief Although the Calvin Kleins are Wong\u2019s favorite, he says these boxer briefs from Everlane deserve an honorable mention. \u201cThe longer legs hug your thighs more, so there\u2019s less of the bunch-up and movement you sometimes get with shorter boxer briefs,\u201d explains Wong, who also appreciates their high-quality fabric. \u201cThey\u2019re almost completely Supima cotton, and very lightweight.\u201d $18 at Everlane Buy\n\nUrban Outfitters Basic Boxer Brief For something fun and easier on the wallet, fashion and branding consultant Ronny Opong likes these boxer briefs from Urban Outfitters. \u201cSurprisingly, they make some great boxer briefs,\u201d he says. He likes the zebra print, but if you\u2019re feeling less bold, the same style is also available in solid black. You can be a single pair for $12 or a three-pack for $28. $12 at Urban Outfitters Buy\n\nHamilton and Hare Stretch- Jersey Boxer Briefs (Pack of 5) This luxury option from a newer brand is also one of Taylor\u2019s favorites. He says the British company is \u201cdoing loungewear and underwear better than anyone else at the moment. There\u2019s a softness and comfort to them, and it\u2019s moisture-wicking, which, for this kind of garment, is very important.\u201d $157 at MATCHESFASHION.COM Buy\n\nSunspel Cotton-Jersey Boxer Trunks They\u2019re pricier than standard boxer briefs, but Taylor loves the high-quality jersey material in Sunspel underwear. $32 at MATCHESFASHION.COM Buy\n\nTommy John Second Skin Boxer Brief Underwear start-up Tommy John got a lot of love from our panel, with three people recommending a different style from the brand. Derek Guy is a big fan of their \u201cSecond Skin\u201d model, and he especially likes the micro-modal fabric the company uses. \u201cThe non-pilling blend wicks moisture away from the skin better than pure cotton, which means you feel drier and more comfortable throughout the day,\u201d he says. The company designs their underwear with a unique, horizontal \u201cquick draw\u201d fly. \u201cI was skeptical when I first heard about it,\u201d says Megan Collins, founder of menswear site Style Girlfriend. \u201cLike, how much better can that really be? But then I gave a pair to my best friend\u2019s husband to try out, and to this day he still will text me saying how much he loves them.\u201d $34 at Tommy John Buy\n\nEmporio Armani Soft Modal Boxer Brief Stylist Brandon Garr generally prefers traditional briefs to boxer briefs because he finds them more comfortable, but the one pair he\u2019ll make an exception for are these modal boxer briefs from Emporio Armani. \u201cThey feel like a second skin, and don\u2019t bunch up like most boxer briefs,\u201d he says. $45 at Giorgio Armani Buy\n\nSAXX Ultra Boxer Briefs (2-Pack) \u201cI purchased my first pair of SAXX brand men\u2019s underwear four years ago, and I haven\u2019t worn anything else since,\u201d says Kyle Andrew, an actor and model. He appreciates Saxx\u2019s \u201cballpark pouch\u201d design, which he says \u201ckeeps things separated for maximum comfort.\u201d His favorite style is the Ultra boxer briefs. They\u2019re made primarily of viscose fabric, a moisture-wicking cotton alternative similar to modal. $57 at SAXX Buy\n\nMeUndies Boxer Briefs Melideo says he generally prefers something less expensive that he can buy in bulk, but \u201cI did get a couple of pairs of MeUndies,\u201d he says, referring to the direct-to-consumer brand. \u201cThey are SUPER soft.\u201d \u00c0 la carte they\u2019re $24 per pair, which is comparable with most premium brands. But if you sign up for the company\u2019s monthly subscription service that price drops to $16. $24 at MeUndies.com Buy\n\nMack Weldon AIRKNIT Boxer Brief Cassandra Sethi, New York City\u2013based personal stylist and founder of Next Level Wardrobe, is a fan of another underwear start-up, Mack Wheldon. \u201cIn my past life as a senior buyer for a luxury fitness gym, our clients loved Mack Weldon. I\u2019m a fan as well. They are based in NYC, develop their own amazing fabrics and are experts at fit as well as quality. I highly recommend their Airknit fabric. It\u2019s super lightweight and breathable with four-way stretch.\u201d $28 at Mack Weldon Buy\n\nTommy John Second Skin Titanium Trunks Barron Cuadro, founding editor of Effortless Gent, also recommends Tommy John, but he prefers this trunk-style model which has a shorter leg than the boxer-briefs. He loves this pair for the fit, wide waistband, and \u201cultrasoft\u201d fabric. And unlike with other underwear, he hasn\u2019t seen any pilling in them over the course of many wears and washes. $32 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nPair of Thieves Super Fit Trunks Collins recommends Pair of Thieves as one of the few direct-to-consumer brands available at budget prices. \u201cEven though they\u2019re more of a mass brand, they really do make it part of their DNA to provide the same level of \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 underwear technology that we\u2019ve come to expect from other companies that are out there \u2018disrupting\u2019 the underwear space.\u201d The bold prints add some punch to a dull underwear drawer, and two-packs go for less than the price of a single pair from higher-end brands. $13 at Target Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
