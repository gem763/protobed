(Francisco Kjolseth/The Salt Lake Tribune via AP)\n\nNearly two months ago, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt signed a secretarial order declaring that electronic bicycles \u201cshall be allowed\u201d in any area on federal land where regular bikes can ride. But even as top officials are pressing ahead to institute the policy, no one knows yet exactly what that means.\n\nIn an interview last week, Bureau of Land Management Director William Perry Pendley said his agency was still determining where people could ride e-bikes, which are an increasingly popular form of motorized bike. Historically, they have been barred from nonmotorized trails.\n\nPendley, who sat for an interview with The Post on Friday in Fort Collins, Colo. before participating in a panel on the future of public lands at the Society of Environmental Journalists annual conference at Colorado State University, noted that e-bikes have gained favor among Americans like his neighbors in Evergreen, Colo. who ride them in the morning when they get doughnuts from a nearby store.\n\n\u201cWe have an aging population,\u201d Pendley explained, adding that \u201clifting that restriction, which maybe made sense before e-bikes but doesn\u2019t make sense now, will increase recreational activities.\u201d\n\nPendley, the former president of the Mountain States Legal Foundation, once pressed to radically reduce the size of federal lands to make way for development. But he compares his new role in the land-management agency to a lawyer switching clients. \"I am a zealous advocate. You can tell, I'm a zealous advocate for my clients. I have a new client now, and my client's the American people and I'll be a zealous advocate for that client.\"\n\nThe Aug. 29 order, which enjoys the support of the bike industry and some mountain bike organizations, says that the change \u201cis intended to increase recreational opportunities for all Americans, especially those with physical limitations, and to encourage the enjoyment of lands and waters managed by the Department of the Interior.\u201d\n\nWhile the order took effect \u201cimmediately,\u201d officials on the federal, state and local level are still trying to determine how it plays out. \u201cAs BLM develops its policy guidance to the field, managers familiar with specific conditions on the ground will consider whether e-bike use is consistent with relevant laws, regulations, and policies,\u201d Interior senior adviser Carol Danko said by email.\n\nAnd several conservation groups have raised concerns about the effect on visitors' experience to backcountry sites, given that e-bikes have motors and can go as fast as 20 to 30 miles per hour.\n\n\u201cThis is the beginning of full motorization of the back country,\u201d said Michael Carroll, senior director for the People Outdoors Program at The Wilderness Society. \u201cThe Secretarial Order has just caused massive confusion for everyone.\u201d\n\nIn Durango, Colo., for example, the town\u2019s Parks and Natural Land Preservation Advisory Board plans to meet to sort out what the policy means for areas where municipal areas banning e-bikes intersect with federal trails. The BLM\u2019s Tres Rios field office has announced that its paths are now open to e- ikes, but many riders access these trailheads by riding on Durango\u2019s trails.\n\nAnd Great Outdoors Colorado, the program that provides millions to state and local governments to preserve and protect open space, has stipulated in some grants that the money is spent on \u201cthe construction of nonmotorized trails of local, regional and statewide significance.\u201d\n\nThe National Park Service issued its electronic bikes policy a day after Bernhardt signed his directive. Pendley said his agency, which manages more than 10 percent of the nation\u2019s land mass, is still consulting with field managers and determining whether some legal obstacles remain.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at whether or not there\u2019s a statutory prohibition against having these quasi-motorized vehicles on the trails,\u201d he said, \u201cthat perhaps may have been funded with the help of \u2026 Congress with funds that were restricted.\u201d\n\nYou are reading The Energy 202, our must-read tipsheet on energy and the environment.

While the first three debates began with policy-oriented questions, this one started with impeachment. But that didn't stop Tom Steyer: After about an hour-and-a-half, the billionaire, environmental activist and now presidential candidate pivoted from a foreign-policy question about Russia to climate change, which he called the \u201cmost important international problem that we're facing.\u201d He also brought up environmental issues in the final question the moderators asked about unlikely friendships, mentioning a South Carolina women who is \u201cfighting for clean water and environmental justice in her community.\u201d\n\nAfter about an hour-and-a-half, the billionaire, environmental activist and now presidential candidate pivoted from a foreign-policy question about Russia to climate change, which he called the \u201cmost important international problem that we're facing.\u201d He also brought up environmental issues in the final question the moderators asked about unlikely friendships, mentioning a South Carolina women who is \u201cfighting for clean water and environmental justice in her community.\u201d Bernie Sanders also shoe-horned it into an answer to an impeachment question: \"It is absolutely imperative we go forward with impeachment,\" the Vermont senator said. \"I hope that [Trump] is impeached.
