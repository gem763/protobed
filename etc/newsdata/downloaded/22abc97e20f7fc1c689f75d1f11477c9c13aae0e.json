However, Joe Manchin is going to stay put in the US Senate \u2014 to the relief of Chuck Schumer:\n\nDemocratic Sen. Joe Manchin will not run for governor of West Virginia in 2020, a spokesman confirmed. The senator, who served as governor of West Virginia from 2005 to 2010, stoked speculation in recent months about a possible run against Republican Gov. Jim Justice, saying in April that being governor of West Virginia is the \u201cbest job in the world.\u201d\n\nAs Justice\u2019s predecessor, Manchin would certainly know that. The allure of going back to his old job must have been strong, too. Manchin has expressed considerable frustration over the hyperpartisan nature of the US Senate and its inability to work together. Some of that frustration \u2014 although certainly not all of it \u2014 has been directed to his own party leadership.\n\nHad Manchin gone back to run for governor, he\u2019s popular enough to be a favorite to win it. However, Republicans would have an enormous advantage in any race for an open Senate seat. Unless the state party nominated a Roy Moore, it would be an almost certain flip. Manchin might be the one Democrat left who could win a statewide race in West Virginia, especially with the specters of Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi hanging over a Senate seat \u2026 or for that matter, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and The Squad, too.\n\nNow that Manchin\u2019s staying put, Democrats won\u2019t have to worry about that seat for another five years. Of course, that assumes that their leftward march doesn\u2019t convince Manchin to follow Justice\u2019s lead and flip over to the GOP. Schumer may not be out of the woods yet in a Green New Deal Democratic Party.", "description": "Schumer safe ... for now, anyway.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Andrew Malcolm"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Joe-Manchin.jpg"}
