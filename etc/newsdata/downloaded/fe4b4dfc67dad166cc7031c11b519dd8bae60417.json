It won't be the same in Zagreb. It will be a different atmosphere.\n\n'We will have 35,000 fans there behind us and there will be great passion which you didn't hear from the home fans in this game.\n\n'Coming to Manchester City with Dinamo Zagreb in the Champions League, you look at it as a top game, the game of your lives for some player.\n\n'The quality of the City players, the stadium, the pitch. We expected a big game. It was a big game, yes, just a bit quiet! Not quite what we expected.'\n\nPep Guardiola has repeatedly expressed a wish for more noise to be generated at home games particularly on European nights when City's reputation suffers in comparison to Liverpool and Anfield. Before the 2-0 win against Zagreb, the manager called on his players to \"seduce\" the fans.\n\nAccording to Pinto, it didn't work. 'We know about Anfield and all these famous English grounds and the atmosphere,' he said.\n\n'City fans may have their reasons why they are louder for a Premier League match against another English team than in the Champions League. It was OK for us, it wasn't a problem that it was quiet, but that is how we found it.\n\nIn our stadium, City are still the big dog and we are the underdogs but with the passionate support we have, we can surprise them. Why not?'", "description": "A lack of atmosphere inside Manchester City's Etihad Stadium is becoming the talk of Europe after Dinamo Zagreb's Ivo Pinto poked fun at the lack of noise at the Etihad.", "authors": ["Joe Bernstein For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/23/19346084-0-image-a-141_1570316365609.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
