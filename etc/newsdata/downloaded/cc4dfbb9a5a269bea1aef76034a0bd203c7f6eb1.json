US President Donald Trump said America was \"locked and loaded\" to respond but later moderated his tone, saying he hoped to avoid conflict.\n\nOil stocks rose, benefitting from the higher prices, but major indices in New York, Europe and Asia all fell.\n\nNate Thooft of Manulife Asset Management told AFP that, while the oil price increases were large, they still left prices themselves below highs reached earlier in the year.\n\nThe stock markets' reaction was also comparatively muted, said Thooft.\n\n\"The pullback is pretty minor in the grand scheme of things,\" he said.\n\n\"Historically, when we had such a significant event in the Middle East, you'd see a much larger reaction.\"\n\n- Brexit hits pound again -\n\nIn China, fresh economic data showed activity had slowed last month, with the pace of industrial production, retail sales and investment in fixed assets all lower.\n\nIn foreign exchange, the dollar was down against the yen and up against the euro, while the pound slid, with the EU saying that Britain had offered no new, viable Brexit proposals after Prime Minister Boris Johnson held Brexit deal talks with EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker.\n\nGold, which along with the yen is seen as a haven in times of geopolitical and economic unrest, rose.\n\nSaudi Arabia was on Monday expected to restore at least a third of the production lost to the attacks, according to experts and reports.\n\nThe Saturday strikes on national energy giant Aramco's Abqaiq processing plant and Khurais oil field knocked 5.7 million barrels per-day off production, more than half of the OPEC kingpin's output.\n\nSaudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said on Sunday the kingdom would use its vast inventories to partially compensate for the lost production and the United States also authorized withdrawals from the American strategic reserve -- though none were yet planned.\n\n\"The attack wiped out around half of Saudi Arabia's production -- representing around five percent of global daily output -- and highlighted the vulnerability of security at these facilities to drone attacks,\" noted Oanda senior market analyst Craig Erlam.\n\n\"Spikes in oil prices when the global economy is already flirting with the idea of recession (are) not ideal and, if repeated and sustained, could ultimately be what tips us over the edge,\" he added.\n\nFacing a dauntingly uncertain economic horizon amid the US-China trade war, the Federal Reserve is set to cut interest rates this coming week.\n\n- Key figures around 2300 GMT -\n\nBrent North Sea crude: UP 14.6 percent at $69.02 per barrel\n\nWest Texas Intermediate: UP 14.7 percent at $62.90\n\nNew York - Dow: DOWN 0.5 percent at 27,076.82 (close)\n\nNew York - S&P 500: DOWN 0.3 percent at 2,997.96 (close)\n\nNew York - Nasdaq: DOWN 0.3 percent at 8,153.54 (close)\n\nLondon - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.6 percent at 7,321.41 points (close)\n\nFrankfurt - DAX 30: DOWN 0.7 percent at 12,380.31 (close)\n\nParis - CAC 40: DOWN 0.9 percent at 5,602.23 (close)\n\nEURO STOXX 50: DOWN 0.9 percent at 3,518.45 (close)\n\nHong Kong - Hang Seng: DOWN 0.8 percent at 27,124.55 (close)\n\nShanghai - Composite: FLAT at 3,030.75 (close)\n\nPound/dollar: DOWN at $1.2424 from $1.2496 at 2030 GMT\n\nEuro/pound: DOWN at 88.56 pence from 88.66 pence\n\nEuro/dollar: DOWN at $1.1002 from $1.1078\n\nDollar/yen: DOWN at 108.10 yen from 108.11 yen\n\nburs-dg/cs", "description": "Crude prices took historic leaps on Monday, as investors reacted to the sudden loss of Saudi oil production capacity following devastating drone attacks over the weekend.", "authors": ["Ben Perry"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8qk.fV_lRMSWM.VjJpG0pg--~B/aD01MTE7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/afp.com/045594818ef29c937ccbd9622c59e2b2992b737e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
