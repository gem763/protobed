Perhaps a lot, if the object being raised is the Queen's eyebrow. Clearly, that's what David Cameron thought when he asked royal officials whether the monarch might oblige to help him convince Scottish voters they ought to back his case for preserving the union in the run-up to the 2014 independence vote. Interviewed for a BBC documentary, Mr Cameron insists there was not \"anything that would be in any way improper\" about the request.\n\nThe Queen later urged people to \"think very carefully about the future\". Scotland went on to reject independence by a margin of 55.3% to 44.7%, a result which Mr Cameron says left him \"blissfully happy\". In the two-part documentary, Mr Cameron also says he ignored the reservations of colleagues to allow the Brexit referendum to take place and now \"broods\" every day about the vote and its consequences.\n\nUK 'has 12 days to set out Brexit plans'\n\nThe current occupant of No 10, Boris Johnson, continues to grapple with the consequences of that Brexit vote. Now Finland's prime minister Antti Rinne says he and French President Emmanuel Macron are in agreement that the UK must produce written proposals for the new Brexit deal Mr Johnson insists he wants by the end of September, or else \"it's over\". A Downing Street source tells the BBC the government will \"put forward proposals at the appropriate time\". Mr Johnson maintains the UK will exit the bloc, with or without a deal, on 31 October. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg says it's not the first time we've seen this \"diplomatic dance\".\n\nGet news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning\n\nTrudeau in 2001 'brownface' photo\n\nIt has emerged that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wore \"brownface\" at an Arabian Nights-themed private school gala nearly two decades ago. In response to Time Magazine publishing the school yearbook photo, Mr Trudeau says he deeply regrets his actions and \"should have known better\". With an election looming, rival party leaders are piling the pressure onto Mr Trudeau. The BBC's Jessica Murphy had already been examining whether he could convince Canadians to rally behind him once again.\n\n'I am a voice for the dead'\n\nBy Swaminathan Natarajan, BBC World Service\n\n\"I saw my mum getting killed in front of my eyes. I couldn't protect her. After that I saw two of my sisters getting killed.\"\n\nTaimour Abdulla Ahmed is thinking back to the evening in May 1988 when, as a 12 year-old, he and dozens of other children and women were forced into a desert pit and Iraqi soldiers opened fire on them.
