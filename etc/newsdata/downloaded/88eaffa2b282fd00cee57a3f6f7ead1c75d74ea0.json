A handful of 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls say yes.\n\nThe roughly 20-strong field looking to beat President Donald Trump next year mostly aligns in its plans to rejoin a Paris Climate Agreement that includes U.S. allies, and most candidates want to end new fossil-fuel leasing on public lands. Widening the lens, however, their environmental proposals reveal key differences, and not just when it comes to U.S. oil, where to extract it and how to sell it.\n\nTen candidates, many of whom have issued or updated their climate-change proposals in recent weeks and days, will participate in one-on-one interviews on CNN Wednesday evening across seven hours of programming. It\u2019s the first time in a presidential campaign that the question of what to do about the \u201cclimate crisis,\u201d as CNN calls it, has earned its own single-issue forum on prime-time television. A CNN poll conducted in April showed that 96% of voters who identify as Democrats favored taking aggressive action to slow the effects of climate change.\n\n\u201cOne area where candidates overwhelmingly agree is ending new leases for fossil-fuel development on federal lands. Investors should take note because this is something that a president can do unilaterally, without congressional approval,\u201d says James Lucier, who leads the energy, environmental and tax practices at Capital Alpha.\n\nRead: UN chief warns of \u2018dramatic climate emergency\u2019 as G-7 pledges $20 million for Amazon fire\n\nFederal lands offshore and onshore currently produce 13% of U.S. natural gas and 24% of U.S. oil CL.1, -0.30% . U.S. crude oil exports will nearly double to 9 million barrels a day by 2024, the International Energy Agency forecasts. That\u2019s enough to surpass Russian shipments and threatens to overtake Saudi exports. But the U.S. should be investing in alternative energy sources, not pouring oil onto the global market, say early poll leaders Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, along with Sen. Cory Booker and select others.\n\nCapital Alpha Note: This graphic was created before candidates John Hickenlooper and Jay Inslee dropped out of the presidential race and before Andrew Yang detailed his proposals.\n\nAbout half of the field is backing a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d that has already been factoring into the election conversation. Some are adding their own features to the pact rolled out by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other members of Congress earlier this year. Sanders, Harris, Warren, Booker and Sen. Amy Klobuchar all signed off on the Green New Deal legislation.\n\nFuture Returns: What would the Green New Deal mean to investors?\n\nFollowing the lead of major states such as California and New York, the candidates with the more advanced plans are moving to endorse features of the Green New Deal, such as a 100%-clean-electricity goal (10 candidates of the 19 tracked by Lucier and Capital Alpha) and a net-zero emissions target by 2050 (nine candidates). Many other candidates have been vocal supporters of the deal, which is at least as much a job-creation bill as climate-protection bill.\n\nSurprisingly, few candidates (only four) lead with an explicit carbon price \u2014 a cost applied to carbon pollution to encourage polluters to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases they emit into the atmosphere. Most candidates are choosing emissions targets instead as a means of stopping ozone depletion. Those that favor a carbon price do generally have less developed policies than those who follow a Green New Deal approach, analysts say. Still, a majority of candidates are at least open to a carbon price, notes Lucier. Entrepreneur Andrew Yang, out with his $5 trillion proposal in late August, plays up the use of nuclear energy more than his competition.\n\nMore candidates have put a price tag on their plans in recent weeks but how exactly they\u2019ll fund ambitious environmental fixes will have to be hammered out as the group narrows.\n\nRelated: Andrew Yang urges Americans to move to higher ground because response to climate change is \u2018too late\u2019\n\nThe Democratic National Committee, by a vote of 222-137, in August ruled against allowing a climate-only debate that former climate-focused 2020 candidate Gov. Jay Inslee and activists had pushed for. Inslee has since announced his withdrawal from the presidential race to run again for Washington governor.\n\nOpinion: How to make sure your ESG fund does what you think it does\n\nUsing the candidates\u2019 own proposals and analysis from Capital Alpha, here\u2019s a snapshot of climate-policy positions among the higher-polling names or those who have made climate change a particular priority. Not all candidates are included, nor are the highlights exhaustive of each candidate\u2019s environmental proposals to date.\n\nBiden: The Obama administration\u2019s vice president wants 100% clean energy and net-zero emissions by 2050. He\u2019ll work with other major international carbon-emitting nations to create enforceable pacts, he says. He\u2019ll advance a $1.7 trillion federal investment and $5 trillion total public-private spending on climate initiatives.\n\nSanders: The long-serving Vermont senator, who considers himself a Democratic Socialist, will push for the end of exports of coal, natural gas and crude oil, while phasing out nuclear energy. He recently detailed a $16 trillion climate plan that builds on the Green New Deal.\n\nWarren: The Massachusetts senator will spend $2 trillion over 10 years in green research, manufacturing and exporting; $1.5 trillion of federal energy product procurement over 10 years; and $100 billion in foreign aid for clean-energy deployment. She\u2019ll ban new fossil-fuel leases offshore and on public lands and will regulate companies to disclose climate risks. Warren has said corruption and lobbying are big obstacles to U.S. action on climate change.\n\nHarris: The California senator updated what had been a relatively thin climate policy proposal ahead of the CNN forum. She is calling for $10 trillion in spending over a decade to combat human-driven global warming and leveling a new tax or fee on companies that emit greenhouse pollution. She had included a climate cooperation pledge as part of foreign policy that she says will restore U.S. footing with allies. As senator, she has co-introduced legislation to block efforts to roll back fuel-emissions standards by the Trump administration.\n\nRead: Trump is reportedly working to prevent more automakers from California emissions rollback defection\n\nBooker: The Newark mayor-turned-New Jersey senator introduced a $3 trillion plan the day after Labor Day that promises spending on clean energy and would require \u201cfossil fuel producers\u201d to pay a carbon fee on coal, natural gas and oil production and end tax subsidies to those industries. He does not go into greater detail about how such a plan would be paid for. \u201cWithout immediate action, we risk an incredible human toll from disasters, health impacts, rising national security threats, and trillions of dollars in economic losses,\u201d he said in a release as deadly Hurricane Dorian churned in the Caribbean and charted a route headed for parts of the Southeast U.S. coast.\n\nKlobuchar: The Minnesota senator was weeks or months behind some of her competition in laying out a climate plan, but on Sept. 1 she advanced her ideas for \u201caggressive executive action\u201d if elected to the White House. Klobuchar would ensure the U.S. participates in the Paris climate agreement on day one of her presidency, restore the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, bring back the fuel-economy standards and introduce legislation that would, she says, put the U.S. on a path to 100% net zero emissions by 2050, among other initiatives.\n\nYang: In his $5 trillion \u201cLower Emissions, Higher Ground\u201d plan released Aug. 26, Yang says he would allow the U.S. to achieve net-zero emissions by the middle of the century. His plan includes: a transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy and upgrading infrastructure and farming practices; moving populations to higher ground; researching the removal of carbon from the atmosphere, including using \u201cspace mirrors\u201d to deflect sunlight. Compared to climate-change plans from most other candidates, Yang\u2019s would focus on keeping nuclear energy. He didn\u2019t say exactly how he\u2019d pay for the $5 trillion proposal, although a carbon tax is included.\n\nSouth Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg: Mayor Pete\u2019s $1.1 trillion plan calls for net-zero emissions by 2050 and creating 3 million clean-energy jobs in the next decade, with a focus on replacing lost rural jobs. His spending on the issue is shy of the between $2 trillion and $16 trillion in climate spending proposed by field front-runners Biden, Warren and Sanders. The mayor detailed the creation of a $250 billion fund matched with $250 billion in private investment with American companies to lead development of green technologies and a $50 billion seed fund for riskier and experimental ideas. Buttigieg had said he\u2019ll explore carbon capture and he\u2019ll push for collaboration with other countries to create climate goals more ambitious than the Paris agreement.\n\nFor too long D.C. has chosen denial and obstruction as we\u2019re faced with the imminent catastrophic effects of climate change. But science compels us to act\u2014and we're running out of time. Today, I'm announcing a plan to unite America to meet this challenge. https://t.co/4KFD800NKq \u2014 Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) September 4, 2019\n\nFormer Texas Congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke: The oil-country politician would provide no new fossil-fuel leases and would change the royalties that oil and gas companies pay taxpayers for pumping from public lands to reflect the greater demands of climate change. He too looks to surpass the Paris agreement, in 2030 and after.\n\nFormer Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro: His \u201cPeople and Planet First Plan\u201d aims to direct $10 trillion in federal, state, local and private investments toward the issue over the next 10 years. A campaign spokesman said the plan would be paid for with a new carbon pollution fee, a restart of the Superfund tax and making \u201cpolluters pay,\u201d CNN said. Previous proposed taxes \u2014 the inheritance tax and wealth inequality tax \u2014 would help pay for the plan, as well as the eliminating the Trump tax cuts. Castro\u2019s plan also calls out the racial impacts of climate change, citing a series of studies that found those most directly impacted by issues like toxic waste, asthma and pollution are more likely to be people of color and more vulnerable communities.\n\nRead: Here\u2019s where the 2020 presidential candidates, including Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, stand on affordable housing\n\nAnd: Where the 2020 candidates stand on student debt and college affordability", "description": "The roughly 20 Democratic hopefuls for the 2020 presidential race align on rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, protecting federal lands and supporting...", "authors": ["Rachel Koning Beals", "News Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ163_warren_ZG_20190826150535.jpg"}
