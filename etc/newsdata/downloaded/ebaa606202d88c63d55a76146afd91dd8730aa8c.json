The agency confirms at least one person has died from vaping-related illnesses.\n\nGovernment health investigators say they discovered a chemical \u2013 an oil derived from Vitamin E \u2013 found in samples of marijuana vaping products from patients all over the country who got sick after vaping. In a case that shows the potential dangers from vaping unknown or uncertain substances, an Illinois teenager talked with CBS News about his near-death experience.\n\nAdam Hergenreder, of Gurnee, Illinois has been hospitalized since last week. \"I'm 18 years old. My lungs are like a 70-year-old's,\" he said.\n\nHergenreder said he vaped with THC, the primary ingredient of marijuana. \"I got it off a drug dealer.\"\n\nCorrespondent Dean Reynolds asked, \"You're buying it off the street from some guy that you don't really know, in retrospect do you think that was kind of dumb?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" he replied. \"When you're addicted like that, I don't think that goes through your mind.\"\n\nSoon after, Hergenreder became feverish, started vomiting, and was gasping for breath. His mother, Polly, drove him to the hospital where he went straight to intensive care.\n\n\"It's probably every parent's nightmare,\" she said. \"And we couldn't make Adam better.\"\n\n\"Did you ever think that your son might die?\" Reynolds asked.\n\n\"Yes, because we were told he would have.\"\n\nHergenreder told Reynolds he'd been vaping for about two years, to get the buzz from nicotine, and then the high from marijuana. Now he says, when he tries to take a deep breath, \"Most of the time it ends up in a cough.\"\n\nHe says now he regrets it. \"Of course. My lungs will never be the same.\"\n\nHergenreder's pulmonologist, Dr. Stephen Amesbury, worries that the current crisis may be only the beginning.\n\nReynolds asked, \"Do you have any doubt in your mind that vaping is responsible for this?\"\n\n\"There doesn't seem to be anything else turning up in these cases,\" Dr. Amesbury replied. \"We look for other potential causes, but we haven't been able to find anything else, and coincidentally all these people have been vaping.\"\n\nContaminants and counterfeit vaping products have been of interest to health officials investigating these illnesses, and while the potential link to the Vitamin E oil is important, the FDA says much more testing is needed to get at the cause of what's making people sick.", "description": "Illinois teen says after vaping with the primary ingredient of marijuana he now has the lungs of a 70-year-old", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/06/dce59c0a-29a2-4594-ae0a-c0c7b5c18e34/thumbnail/1200x630/3c2b1eb231dc16bf2bf590b4f4f5e04f/0906-ctm-vapingcontaminant-reynolds-1927898-640x360.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
