Highs: Mid-to-upper 60s.\n\nTonight: Evening shower chance mainly southeast. Lows: Upper 40s to mid-50s.\n\nTomorrow: Warm and mostly sunny.

Into the afternoon and evening, a weak system thickens that cloud cover and brings a chance for a few light showers, especially south and southeast of the Beltway. But even for those lucky enough to see raindrops, it\u2019s sure no drought-buster. Highs reach the mid-to-upper 60s with light winds, from the northeast during the morning, and from the southeast during the afternoon. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTonight: The risk of some light showers continues into the evening mainly southeast of the Beltway. We should then see partial clearing overnight, which may allow for some patchy fog to develop in outlying areas. Lows dip into the upper 40s to mid-50s. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for the latest updates. For related traffic news, check out Gridlock.

Light winds form the west help to dry us out and warm us up. Temperatures head for the sweet spot, topping out in the low-to-mid 70s under mostly sunny skies. Sure, we need some rain, but it\u2019s hard to find fault with days like this. Confidence: High\n\nTomorrow night: Clear and cool is the name of the game into the overnight. Skies sparkle and shimmer with stars, as temperatures fall to the mid-40s in the coolest spots to the low 50s downtown. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nTuesday looks like another nice one, with mostly sunny skies and highs back in the low-to-mid 70s. Subtle changes start to arrive later in the afternoon and evening, with increasing clouds as winds start to come from the southeast. Cloud cover continues to increase Tuesday night with a shower possible toward morning and mild lows in the upper 50s and low 60s. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nWednesday brings our first significant chance for appreciable rainfall in some time. While it\u2019s too soon to say rain is a sure bet, periods of rain seem increasingly likely. If you listen hard enough, you\u2019ll hear sighs of relief from the local flora. Highs head for the upper 60s to near 70, and winds could turn somewhat gusty late.
