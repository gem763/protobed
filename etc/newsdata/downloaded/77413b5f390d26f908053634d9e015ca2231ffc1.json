It\u2019s time for a constructive conversation based on the facts.\n\nThe summer of 2019 didn\u2019t just bring us high temperatures \u2014 it featured hot rhetoric over policymakers\u2019 concerns that redemptions from open-end investment funds could cause financial stability risks.\n\nThe Bank of England asserted that \u201cthe mismatch between redemption terms and the liquidity of some funds\u2019 assets has the potential to become a systemic issue.\u201d The European Systemic Risk Board warned of financial vulnerabilities associated with \u201cliquidity transformation\u201d by bond funds. And the Bank for International Settlements, the International Monetary Fund and the G20\u2019s Financial Stability Board have all echoed similar concerns.\n\nStatements like these are not new. But the summer of 2019 also brought the overheated charge that regulated stock and bond funds that provide daily redemption are \u201cbuilt on a lie.\u201d\n\nNow that the weather is cooling, it\u2019s time to cool down the rhetoric too and start a more constructive conversation. The ability of funds to manage liquidity and meet investor redemptions are legitimate subjects for discussion. But that discussion must be informed by the historical record and data, along with a deeper understanding of how these vehicles operate, are regulated, are used by their investors and interact with capital markets.\n\nOpen-end funds \u2014 US mutual funds and UCITS in Europe \u2014 have a proven track record of meeting investor redemptions, including during times of market stress.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the historical record. Open-end funds \u2014 U.S. mutual funds and UCITS (undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities) in Europe \u2014 have a proven track record of meeting investor redemptions, including during times of market stress. Over the past 35 years, U.S. stock and bond funds alone have paid $58 trillion in redemptions on demand.\n\nThis strong track record is built on a solid foundation. Put simply, open-end equity and bond funds are regulated and operated precisely so that investors can redeem their shares. Investors expect, and the law requires, that these funds maintain sufficient liquidity to meet redemptions.\n\nHow do they do it? First and foremost, open-end funds invest predominantly in liquid securities. For both UCITS and U.S. mutual funds, regulations restrict or otherwise limit the amount of illiquid assets a fund may hold.\n\nWhen regulated funds offer daily redemption, they value their portfolio holdings each day. Subscriptions and redemptions are priced based on end-of-day valuations, which means that an investor\u2019s transactions reflect what has already happened in the market. The fund\u2019s portfolio gains and losses are factored into the amount that the investor pays or receives.\n\nCases in which UCITS have [suspended redemptions]\u2014including this summer\u2019s high-profile events in the U.K.\u2014have had no systemic effects.\n\nAnd the legal obligation to meet redemptions shapes every aspect of fund management. Fund managers construct their portfolios and investment strategies to align with their funds\u2019 dealing frequency and their investors\u2019 needs. They actively monitor their funds\u2019 overall liquidity profile and investors\u2019 anticipated subscription and redemption activity. They diversify their portfolios, creating varying streams of dividends and interest payments. In short, they work hard to ensure they have cash flow and assets that, in the aggregate, are sufficiently liquid to meet anticipated fund flows.\n\nWhen investors wish to redeem fund shares, funds have numerous sources to meet those redemptions \u2014 including cash holdings and cash from new investor share purchases, interest and dividend payments, and proceeds from maturing securities and portfolio rebalancing. This means that redemptions may not require sales of portfolio securities at all \u2014 let alone the \u201cfire sales\u201d at steep discounts that some regulators fear will trigger systemic problems.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that no fund has ever experienced difficulties. But in the vast U.S. fund market, we have found only six instances in five decades when equity and bond funds suspended redemptions. Notably, each of these events involved unique circumstances and none had any impact on the broader financial system. Similarly, cases in which UCITS have employed this emergency tool \u2014 including this summer\u2019s high-profile events in the U.K. \u2014 have had no systemic effects.\n\nPut these facts together, and it\u2019s clear: Liquidity management by open-end funds is far more dynamic and robust than many academics and regulators seem to appreciate.\n\nAnd the evidence bears this out. The Investment Company Institute has provided regulators with data demonstrating that investors are buyers as well as sellers of fund shares \u2014 even during severe market downturns, as the chart shows for European-domiciled bond funds. Data also shows that funds are buyers as well as sellers of securities, even in stressed markets. Markets are never one-sided with all sellers and no buyers.\n\nLiquidity management by open-end funds is far more dynamic and robust than many academics and regulators seem to appreciate.\n\nDecades of experience likewise show that fund investors don\u2019t panic or run in volatile markets. In more than 40 episodes of market turmoil since 1944, in the U.S., Europe and Canada, fund shareholders have responded quite moderately, with no mass redemptions. (In a future article, we\u2019ll provide more evidence on how fund investors behave, and why.)\n\nThe mission of policymakers concerned with \u201cfinancial stability\u201d is understandably to look for sources of instability. Yet it is incumbent upon those who attribute potential financial stability risks to open-end funds to take into account the extensive public record of data, history, regulation and fund operations, and to re-examine assertions that don\u2019t match the facts about these funds.\n\nAuthors:", "description": "These funds have a proven track record of meeting investor redemptions, even during times of market stress.
