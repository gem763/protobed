But then the family spent a couple weeks traveling through Hawaii in a rented Volkswagen VWAGY, +1.43% van, and after that they knew they were heading for #vanlife.\n\n\u201cI was immediately on Craigslist looking for vans after that trip,\u201d jokes Paul\u2019s wife, attorney Rebecca Eichler, 49.\n\nIn 2015, the couple \u2014 whose kids were then 10 and 13 (Rebecca says they chose to do it at these ages because \u201cthey weren\u2019t at pivotal years in school\u201d) \u2014 hit the road in a 1985 VW Vanagon van. They spent $6,500 on the van and $7,000 refurbishing it with a new transmission, shocks, gaskets, brake hoses and more; they even glued eyelashes on the headlights and named the van Wesley, after the main character in their favorite movie \u201cThe Princess Bride.\u201d Paul got a year-long leave of absence from his job to take the trip; Rebecca, who runs her own immigration firm, put her work on hold for a year; and the couple homeschooled the children during the journey.\n\n\u201cDespite the hard times, we could see the resiliency in the kids as things progressed. They were able to bounce back from disappointment and hard situations \u2014 hot weather, bugs, foods that they didn\u2019t necessarily love but ate because that is what there was in this or that village.\u201d Rebecca Eichler\n\nThe plan was to spend a year traveling through Central and South America all the way down to the tip of Argentina \u2014 but after their first week in Mexico, where they stayed in the same spot for a week, they decided to take the trip slower and just do Central America. The family ended up going roughly 15,000 miles \u2014 they aren\u2019t exactly sure how far as the odometer broke at some point in El Salvador and they didn\u2019t fix it until they reached Nicaragua a few weeks later \u2014 through seven countries including Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Panama.\n\nPaul Carlino & Rebecca Eichler\n\nAmong the highlights: They spent a few weeks on Ometepe Island (in the middle of a lake in Nicaragua) making chocolate with an American woman who had a biodynamic farm there (they found her through the WorkAway program, which connects travelers who are looking for a place to stay and willing to do work for it).\n\n\u201cShe had no electricity, dirt floors, chickens were running around everywhere, her water came from a hose connected to a spring \u2026 There were glass bottles everywhere where she said she was trapping earth spirits.\u201d They helped her make chocolate bars -- that\u2019s how she earned money, Rebecca says \u2014 that she sold to hotels, tourists, \u201cand a bunch to the commune up the hill\u201d where the residents might have sometimes \u201cbeen a little stoned,\u201d Paul jokes.\n\nThey also did some building for a riverside eco-lodge in Costa Rica, witnessed an olive ridley turtle nesting in Mexico, sledded down a volcano in Nicaragua, and crossed the Panama Canal onboard a catamaran. They did this by becoming volunteer line handlers \u2014 in which you secure mooring lines on a boat; the Panamanian government requires four line handlers on a boat when crossing the canal. \u201cSomeone we had met earlier in the trip gave us the idea. It was an adventure, we spent the night on a catamaran that had come all the way from Portugal,\u201d Paul says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d do it all again in a heartbeat,\u201d says Paul \u2014 who adds that they\u2019ve already been talking the two of them taking that trip once the kids graduate from high school. Here\u2019s what the trip cost, what the kids really thought about it, and more.\n\nPaul Carlino & Rebecca Eichler\n\nThe cost:\n\nThe couple saved for eight years to pay for the trip, scrimping on housing (they continued to live in their roughly 1,200-square-foot home in Alexandria even after they had two kids). They also didn\u2019t have cable TV, lived with hand-me-down furniture and clothing instead of new, and drove old cars as long as they lasted. Rebecca adds that the couple worked to repay their student loans and mortgage as soon as they could, never carried a balance on their credit cards. \u201cOur lifelong philosophy is to be cheap,\u201d Paul writes on the family\u2019s website, where they chronicled the trip and its costs.\n\nPaul documented the costs of the trip, and estimates that they spent $36,000 on the year (not including the cost of the van and its repairs, and health insurance for the year, which costs upwards of $2,000 for the year (they got a travel insurance policy that did not cover them in the U.S.) The biggest cost was food for the family, which he estimates was about $12,000 for the year; that was followed by accommodations at about $10,000 for the year. Paul jokes that he wanted the family to sleep in the van the whole time, but \u201cin an effort to not give them too much to talk about in therapy later,\u201d he jokes, he agreed to hotels and AirBnBs sometimes (usually when it was too hot to sleep in the van).\n\nEntertainment came in at about $3,500 a year \u2014 they did everything from rock climbing to surfing lessons to museums and carnivals \u2014 and miscellaneous expenses (purchases like laundry, gas, SIM cards for the phone and haircuts) cost about $5,500.\n\nPaul Carlino & Rebecca Eichler\n\nThe kids:\n\nIt was certainly an adventure for the kids \u2014 who did everything from ziplining to learning to surf to jumping off waterfalls \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t always easy for them. One of the big challenges for the kids was not having peers their age with them at all times, as well as the language barrier, Rebecca says: \u201cSo, when we did find English speaking kids, we tended to stay put where they were until they moved on.\u201d\n\nTheir daughter, who was 13 at the time, struggled with may parts of the trip, says Rebecca, adding that \u201c13 is a challenging age to be anywhere\u201d and noting that \u201cwe\u2019ve got lots of photos of her holding her hand in front of the camera as if warding off the paparazzi.\u201d Their 10-year-old son was enthusiastic for most of the trip though, \u201calways up for swimming, exploring, and trying new foods,\u201d Rebecca says. Now, that\u2019s flipped. \u201cOnce we were back, she was proud of it, whereas our son who is now 13 says he will never get in the van again.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite the hard times, we could see the resiliency in the kids as things progressed. They were able to bounce back from disappointment and hard situations \u2014 hot weather, bugs, foods that they didn\u2019t necessarily love but ate because that is what there was in this or that village. They also gained a perspective, first in a sense of understanding how privileged we are to be born and raised in the US,\u201d Rebecca says.\n\nWhen the year was up:\n\nThe couple returned to their regular jobs in 2016, but after a year spent on the road, things felt different. \u201cWe came back and were very changed. It\u2019s hard to fit back into that same life,\u201d Paul says. \u201cWe met so many people doing different things, taking different paths \u2014 they\u2019d all be sitting on the same beach but from different paths.\u201d\n\nSo in January 2018 the couple moved to San Miguel de Allende in the highlands of Mexico, where their cost of living is a third of what it was in the U.S. To earn money and pay private school tuition for the kids, they rent out their house in Alexandria; they earn extra money for everything else by freelance writing, running Spanish courses for U.S. professionals and doing various other odd jobs (tax return preparation and brewing and selling kombucha).\n\nAs a result of the van trip and seeing how other people lived, \u201cWe realized we didn\u2019t have to go to a job every day. We can choose how we want to live our lives \u2014 do what we want,\u201d Paul says. \u201cIt is not an impossible dream \u2014 there are communities of people out there doing this \u2014 single people, couples, families. If they want to, they can.\u201d", "description": "The 15,000-mile journey that changed their lives", "authors": ["Catey Hill"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP230_van3_ZG_20190812112131.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
