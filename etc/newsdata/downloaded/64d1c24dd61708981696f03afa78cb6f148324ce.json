No country is safe\".\n\n\"The escalation of violence has led to an unprecedented humanitarian crisis\" in the Sahel, he said.\n\nThe meeting, of the Economic Community Summit of West African States (Ecowas), also called on states \"not to accept that terrorists use their territory as a sanctuary or base to fall back on\".\n\nSome interpreted that statement as a dig at Mali and the insecurity in Kidal.", "description": "As West African leaders try to find ways to stop jihadist violence in the Sahel region, attention is turning to a rebel-held town in Mali's north accused of being a base for militants to launch attacks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8183/ea3478c3b05347a18b8a614bc65f8062.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
