It allowed him to reflect on his life and provided time to think about family members that he had recently lost.\n\n\"I had some times where I need some guidance and I actually pleaded with God to give me direction and to make me worthy of the challenge,\" reminisced the retired health company entrepreneur.\n\n\"I believe in God and a higher power and it was really comforting for me to use that as a crutch to keep going.\"\n\n'Gave me their beds'\n\nDespite extensive preparation, there were certain things along the way that were out of Long's capable control. One of which was the weather.\n\nConditions on the steppe would switch suddenly from torrential rain to sweating heat but being entirely immersed in nature also provided some memorable moments.\n\nFrom wading through large river crossings to watching the local herdsmen, Long fell in love with the country and communities along the route.\n\nWith a strict 8 p.m. curfew, when participants would have to stop riding for the day, Long found himself knocking on doors to find a place to sleep at night.\n\nDespite an obvious language barrier, the random interactions with the local people turned out to be the most humbling experiences.\n\n\"They all accepted me and some of them gave me their beds and they slept on the floor,\" he said.\n\nOne particular moment, when staying with a young mother and her two daughters, still stands out among the rest.\n\n\"It has just quit raining and the sun was setting,\" he said fondly.\n\n\"The two daughters were sitting on the edge of this corral, where they kept their calves, singing some kind of Mongolian lullaby. It was so neat to see.\n\n\"In the morning, she [the mother] wore her ceremonial gown and milked the cow for me. I had fresh cream milk on sweet rice cereal. Man, it was so good.\"\n\nPhotos: Why \"Glorious Goodwood\" is so loved Goodwood racecourse offers far-reaching views across the Sussex Downs in the south of England.
