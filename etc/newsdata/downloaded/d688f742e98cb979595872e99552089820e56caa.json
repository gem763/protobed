This run-up in the T stock price was during a period of concerns over a global trade war with China and the U.S. Federal Reserve expressing a certain degree of skepticism about a cooling housing market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile some investors may want to step back and wait for the enthusiasm to cool off, there are several reasons why the rally in AT&T stock may still have steam left.\n\nThree Reasons to Keep an Eye on AT&T Stock\n\nSeptember Is iPhone Apple Mania Month\n\nSeptember is usually a huge month for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as it often comes down with plenty of hot announcements. And just recently AAPL announced its new iPhone line up. The media coverage will send shoppers flocking to their nearest AT&T store to place orders. AT&T will be among the first carriers to offer the newest iPhone 11, iPhone11 Pro and iPhone Pro Max as well as the Apple Watch Series 5.\n\nRegardless of the actual top-line revenue boost that the new iPhone product line delivers to AT&T, the launch will create buzz that should lift the price of T stock.\n\nShortly after the Apple iPhone announcement, David Christopher, president of AT&T Mobility and Entertainment, chimed in: \u201c[the] iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro are cutting-edge devices that deserve more than a \u2018just OK\u2019 network \u2026 AT&T is the nation\u2019s best wireless network that\u2019s also the fastest network for iPhones.\u201d\n\nFurther, T has poured billions into its 5G Evolution and will be front and center in offering 5G speeds once the new technology standard is introduced. According to John Stephens, Chief Financial Officer, AT&T plans to have 5G in parts of 29 cities within six months and nationwide 5G coverage on sub-6 GHz spectrum by the first half of 2020.\n\nWarner Media Is Driving Revenues Across Businesses Lines\n\nAT&T is unique in the telecom sector in that it controls parts of the entire value chain from content creation, transmission to point of sale and direct to consumer distribution in premium brand names such as HBO, Directv and SKY. This comprehensive control of the value chain has delivered revenue growth across content sales, consumer distribution and advertising.\n\nAccording to an update by AT&T to shareholders, \u201cEntertainment Group EBITDA was up nearly 4% in the first half of the year.\u201d The potential long-term strength behind T becomes even clearer when you add to that the fact that Stephens expects the Warner Media synergies to deliver $700 million additional revenue by the end of the year and direct-to-consumer sales will also see a boost next year as AT&T will move forward with the launch of a premium-priced HBO Max service in spring 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nAT&T Is De-Leveraging and Optimizing Its Capital Structure\n\nAt a recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch Media, Communications & Entertainment conference in Los Angeles, AT&T detailed plans of reducing debt and becoming essentially a company with less financial risk and increased free cash flow. The huge debt load among telecom firms caused in part by the billions spent in the run up to 5G has been an a risk issue plaguing the entire industry.", "description": "AT&T (NYSE:T) is on a roll.
