The law itself has been criticised for its ambiguous language, and led jurors to acquit him.\n\nThe government lawyers failed to make a convincing argument in his case, and the verdict makes one thing clear: it's tough to prosecute individuals under the act or for related violations.\n\nLobbyists who earn money from foreign governments are still required to file the paperwork, but now they will rest a bit easier.", "description": "Greg Craig was the only Democratic appointee charged as a result of the Mueller inquiry.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E859/production/_108618495_hi012760027.jpg"}
