According to 9to5Mac, some Creative Cloud subscribers received emails last night inviting them to sign up for the beta program through a Google Forms signup page.\n\nPhotoshop CC for the iPad is a more powerful software than any other iOS or Android app Adobe has released so far, including the more limited Photoshop Sketch and Adobe Illustrator Draw. Adobe is aiming to bring \u201creal Photoshop\u201d to the iPad, with features like layers, masks, selections, transforming, and importable brushes. Its main selling point is Cloud PSDs that will be able to sync changes across the desktop and the iPad so you can work across devices with the same file. There won\u2019t be any video-oriented features, though, so you won\u2019t be able to use it to make animations.\n\nThe app was still in its early stages when we tested it out last October, with a mostly finished UI but minimal functionality. Hopefully, these invites mean that the app is nearly ready and close to release. If you\u2019re a Creative Cloud subscriber and want to test it out, you can sign up through the Google Forms link above, but there\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019ll be chosen.", "description": "Adobe has sent out emails inviting Creative Cloud subscribers to sign up to beta test its upcoming Photoshop CC for the iPad.", "authors": ["Dami Lee", "May"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lu05AZHrHxpbtKbvRspmCiFa960=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13263213/akrales_181012_3024_0062.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-14"}
