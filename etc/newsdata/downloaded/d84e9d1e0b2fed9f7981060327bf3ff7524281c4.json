I mean God almighty,\u2019 Hearn said on talkSPORT. \u2018I listened to him last night, ramble, ramble, it\u2019s like everyone\u2019s playing games with Ronnie because all you\u2019ve got to say is something to him and he will automatically disagree with you.\n\nRonnie O\u2019Sullivan has been critical of the English Open again (Picture: VCG via Getty Images)\n\n\u2018I think he\u2019s best left out there with the fairies at the bottom of the garden.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHearn especially took exception to the idea that O\u2019Sullivan is \u2018forced\u2019 to play against opponents that \u2018are just happy to be there.\u2019\n\n\u2018Forced!\u2019 Hearn exclaimed. \u2018It\u2019s like Tiger Woods saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to play someone who\u2019s not ranked in the top 10.\u201d\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t lose my patience, I used to find him quite amusing but now I find him deadly dull. I find him so boring.\n\n\u2018I think he\u2019s the greatest player in the world, I love to watch him play snooker, he is fabulous entertainment, but once he gets into a studio and goes on a rant\u2026\n\n\u2018The game has never been in a better place , there\u2019s never been more money, never been more opportunity.\n\n\u2018When Ronnie was quiet the prize money was \u00a33.5m for the season, but he don\u2019t stop talking now it\u2019s \u00a316m.\n\n\u2018Yes there are kids coming through the ranks and yes he will have to play them and yes that kid is \u2018up for none\u2019 because he\u2019s playing Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan!\n\n\u2018He doesn\u2019t have to play in anything, he can sit at home all day, watch the tele, listen to you on the radio.\n\n\u2018Ronnie picks and chooses what he plays in, now he wants to pick and choose who he plays.
