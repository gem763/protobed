When a road system is better organised, the movement of vehicles and passengers is more efficient and uses less resources.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, when the connections between brain regions are more structured, information processing can be performed more efficiently.\u201d\n\nDr Feng, who has previously published findings on the links between tea consumption and overall human health, added: \u201cOur current results relating to brain network indirectly support our previous findings by showing that the positive effects of regular tea drinking are the result of improved brain organisation brought about by preventing disruption to interregional connections.\u201d\n\nIn the future, the team of researchers plans to examine the effects that tea, and bioactive compounds found in tea, have on cognitive decline.\n\nIn addition to brain health, tea consumption, especially of green tea, has been linked to a lower risk of heart disease, cancer and diabetes, according to Harvard Medical School.", "description": "Tea-drinkers may enjoy benefits apart from caffeine boosts and relaxation, as researchers believe drinking tea could also be good for your brain.\u00a0 According to a new study by the National University of Singapore (NUS), regular tea drinkers have better organised brain regions compared to non-tea drinkers.", "authors": ["Chelsea Ritschel"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/16/16/istock-928034704.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
