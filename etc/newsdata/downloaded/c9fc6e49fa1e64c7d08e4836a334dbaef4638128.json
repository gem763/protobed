The proposal, which called for customs stations on each side of the Ireland-Northern Ireland border, failed to win over support from the EU.\n\nBritish Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay has called for more intensive talks with his EU counterparts before an Oct. 17 summit on the issue, which precedes Britain\u2019s Oct. 31 departure deadline. Outgoing EU President Jean-Claude Juncker and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier will address European Parliament Wednesday about recent negotiation efforts.\n\nJohnson plans to meet with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar Thursday and call for British lawmakers to meet on Saturday, Oct. 19, for a rare weekend session.\n\nIrish officials have also rejected Johnson\u2019s backstop alternative.\n\n\u201cThere are some fundamental objectives that haven\u2019t changed for the past three years and we need them guaranteed,\u201d Varadkar said. \u201cI think it is going to be very difficult to secure an agreement by next week, quite frankly.\n\n\u201cEssentially what the U.K. has done is repudiate the deal that we negotiated in good faith with Prime Minister [Theresa] May\u2019s government over two years and sort of put half of that now back on the table and are saying: \u2018That\u2019s a concession.\u2019 And of course, it isn\u2019t really.\u201d\n\nJohnson has vowed to leave the EU on schedule, on Oct. 31. Previously, he\u2019s said the departure will happen regardless of a deal, but British lawmakers have forced him, through the Benn Act, to request a delay if no deal is present by Oct. 19, two days after the summit.\n\n\u201cDeal or no deal, but no delay,\u201d Johnson reiterated on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s time to get Brexit done and get on with delivering on Britain\u2019s priorities: safer streets, better hospitals and improved schools.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 9 (UPI) \u2014 Talks between Britain and the European Union over London\u2019s departure from the 28-nation bloc ended Wednesday without an", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
