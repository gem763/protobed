That\u2019s a hashtag right now,\u201d the Capitals captain said after Carlson\u2019s two goals helped the Washington Capitals to a 5-3 win over the Calgary Flames on Tuesday night.\n\nCarlson scored and added an empty-netter for an NHL-leading 20 points (five goals, 15 assists) in 11 games.\n\nThe 29-year-old American is the fourth different defenseman in NHL history to register 20 points or more in October joining Paul Coffey (1981, 1988), Al MacInnis (1988) and Brian Leetch (1990).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great thing obviously. I don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d Carlson said.\n\nHe has three games remaining this month to better the high of 25 points in 13 games set by MacInnis when he was with Calgary.\n\nOvechkin had a goal and an assist and Tom Wilson also scored for Washington. Chandler Stephenson got the credit on an own-goal by the Flames. Braden Holtby finished with 32 saves.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a dangerous team when we\u2019re doing the right things,\u201d Carlson said.\n\nElias Lindholm, Tobias Rieder and Austin Czarnik scored for the Flames. Cam Talbot stopped 25 shots in his second straight start.\n\n\u201cFor good stretches of the game I felt we played well and carried the game, but ultimately it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Flames forward Matthew Tkachuk said. \u201cWe still didn\u2019t get any points tonight. \u2026 They\u2019re a good hockey team, probably the best we\u2019ve played this year. That was a good measuring-stick team.\u201d\n\nWilson pushed Washington\u2019s lead to 4-2 on a feed from Lars Eller to beat Talbot under his left pad with 7:26 left in the third period. Carlson\u2019s empty-netter with 1:45 remaining maid it a three-goal game before Rieder capped the scoring with 16 seconds to go.\n\nTen seconds after Czarnik pulled the Flames even at 2-2 in the second, Ovechkin quieted the Saddledome with a go-ahead goal with 3:25 left in the period.\n\nThe Capitals\u2018 captain took a backhand pass from Nicklas Backstrom on a 2-on-1 and wired the puck home for his seventh of the season.\n\nCzarnik scored his first by pouncing on a loose puck and sweeping it past Holtby during a goal-mouth scramble for a T.J. Brodie rebound.\n\nTalbot mishandled Carlson\u2019s off-speed shot from the boards for Washington\u2019s first goal of the game 35 seconds into the second period.\n\n\u201cPretty lucky,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cI\u2019ve had some good fortune this month.\u201d\n\nStephenson\u2019s centering pass from behind Calgary\u2019s net deflected off Flames defenseman Rasmus Andersson and in at 2:41 to make it 2-0.\n\nLindholm halved the deficit with a power-play goal at 3:19, his team-high sixth goal. The Swede wristed a cross-ice feed from Johnny Gaudreau over Holtby\u2019s glove.\n\nCalgary outshot the Caps 15-9 in a scoreless first period.\n\nNOTES: Carlson is five points back of Kevin Hatcher (426) for the third-most points by a Capitals defenseman in franchise history. \u2026 Ovechkin is four goals from passing Luc Robitaille (668) for 12th in all-time NHL scoring. \u2026 Flames forward Sam Bennett was scratched a second straight game with an undisclosed injury.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCapitals: At Edmonton on Thursday night.\n\nFlames: Host Florida on Thursday night.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Alex Ovechkin is starting an early-season campaign for teammate John Carlson to win this season's Norris Trophy as the league's top defenseman.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/23/capitals_flames_hockey_89877_c0-310-3200-2176_s1200x700.jpg?dcb9c0a308d96b972babc16fdc7d1be1b59b020f", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
