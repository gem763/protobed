The CBA prevents teams offering players with his amount of service time more than 30 percent of the cap, so they couldn\u2019t offer him more money if they wanted.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nGeneral manager Jon Horst quickly said that they will offer Antetokounmpo the supermax when eligible, but the Bucks have work cut out for them to make his decision easy in the summer of 2021.\n\n\u201cBud and I talk about this all the time: It\u2019s our responsibility to create an environment, a culture, a basketball organization where our players want to come to work every day with players that they want to play with every day, and they want to win at the highest level,\u201d Horst said, via Fox Sports Wisconsin. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken great steps towards that last year. We\u2019ve continued to build on that, we\u2019re going to continue to build on that, and I think we all fully believe that if we continue to put the right things in place and give Giannis the right opportunity, he loves Milwaukee, he loves the state of Wisconsin, and I think he\u2019ll be a Buck for a long time.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bucks have already had to make tough decisions as key players hit free agency. This summer, they opted to keep All-Star Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez and George Hill over Malcolm Brogdon, and supplemented their roster with Kyle Korver and Robin Lopez.\n\nPlenty of teams \u2014 from the Warriors to the Knicks to the Lakers \u2014 will be licking their chops for a chance to bring in Antetokounmpo, perhaps the league\u2019s best player. If the Bucks can take the next step and win a championship in the next two years, maybe he\u2019ll stick around for good.\n\nThe bad news is that Toronto did just that, and even they couldn\u2019t stop Kawhi Leonard from leaving for the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nBucks GM Jon Horst confirmed that the team will offer Giannis Antetokounmpo a supermax deal next summer when first eligible.
