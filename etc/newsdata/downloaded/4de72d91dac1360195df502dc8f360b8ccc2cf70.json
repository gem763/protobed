We have deployed forces in and around Halle and are trying to stabilise the situation until we have all the relevant information.\"\n\nThe railway station in Halle, a city of 240,000, was closed down as a precaution amid the police operation.\n\nMass-selling daily Bild said on its website the shooting took place in front of a synagogue.\n\nBut a police spokesman could not confirm this to Euronews, saying it happened on a street containing both a church and a synagogue, not necessarily outside the Jewish place of worship.\n\nOn the same street is a Jewish cemetery.\n\nThe Associated Press reports a person interviewed on n-tv television said he had been in a kebab shop when he saw a man with a helmet and a military jacket who he said fired shots into the shop, in the incident in Halle.\n\nPolice said they were also investigating reports of shots fired in Landsberg, 15 kilometres (about 10 miles) from Halle, although it is unclear whether those reports relate to the incident in Halle.\n\nThis is a developing story, check back for updates.", "description": "Two people killed and several injured in Germany street shooting", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/21/96/26/1000x563_cmsv2_972dc96a-d9d5-5c0a-95d3-2806313c5dd5-4219626.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
