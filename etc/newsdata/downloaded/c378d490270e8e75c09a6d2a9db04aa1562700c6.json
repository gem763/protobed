David Benioff and DB Weiss, the writers behind Game of Thrones, will no longer be working on a new Star Wars trilogy for Lucasfilm.\n\nThe release of the three new films was due to happen in 2022, with Benioff and Weiss tackling a new, post-Skywalker era for the franchise.\n\nHowever, the pair have suggested that they no longer have time to define the stories of a new galaxy, far, far away after making a historic nine-figure deal with Netflix in August.\n\n\u201cThere are only so many hours in the day, and we felt we could not do justice to both Star Wars and our Netflix projects,\u201d the pair said in a statement to Deadline. \u201cSo we are regretfully stepping away.\u201d\n\nThat D&D, as they are known, are so in-demand with the studios but sneered at by fans is largely down to the final season of Game of Thrones, which many viewers thought was the epic series' worst. Many became skeptical of the Star Wars deal after several bizarre narrative choices came to define the fantasy saga's reputation.\n\nLucasfilm, however, have not closed the door on having D&D return to the writers room. Kathleen Kennedy, the company's president, said: \u201cDavid Benioff and Dan Weiss are incredible storytellers. We hope to include them in the journey forward when they are able to step away from their busy schedule to focus on Star Wars.\u201d", "description": "It was an announcement that sent some Star Wars fans into despair:", "authors": ["Telegraph Reporters", "Tim Robey", "Eleanor Halls"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tv/2019/05/15/TELEMMGLPICT000197152211-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwVvrlgp8cXzmrYAgKfQ-SHk.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
