His melodies will always be part of our memory.\u201d\n\nHe was born Camilo Blanes Cort\u00e9s in the city of Alcoy, in southeastern Spain, and studied at art school before launching a music career. Mr. Sesto took his stage name partly out of superstition: Sesto is an alternate spelling of sexto, Spanish for sixth, and he noted that his given, middle and family names each have six letters, and that he was the sixth member of his family.\n\n\u201cAnd if you want to be numerical about it, the street number of my house is 3399,\u201d he told the Miami Herald in 1993. \u201cAdd the numbers and you get 24 \u2014 4 and 2 makes six. My son was born on the 24th. Again, 4 and 2 equals six. \u2026 Is it a coincidence or something more?\u201d\n\nMr. Sesto never married and had his son, Camilo Blanes, through a relationship with Lourdes Ornelas. Complete information on survivors was not immediately available.\n\nHe was scheduled to release a new album Sept. 13 and begin a U.S. tour in October.\n\n\u201cI want people to believe in what I do, to identify with what I do,\u201d Mr. Sesto told the Herald. \u201cAnd for that you have to give them your heart and soul. It must be a total submission.\u201d\n\nRead more Washington Post obituaries\n\nFrancisco Toledo, Mexican artist and activist known as \u2018El Maestro,\u2019 dies at 79\n\nCarol Lynley, actress in 1972 blockbuster \u2018The Poseidon Adventure,\u2019 dies at 77\n\nJames Atlas, explorer of literary lives and publisher of biographies, dies at 70", "description": "He sold more than 100 million records, buoyed by hits like \u201cAlgo de M\u00ed.\u201d", "authors": ["News Services", "Staff Reports"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SGNR6EGSTII6TE2DIDNVPT3KXU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
