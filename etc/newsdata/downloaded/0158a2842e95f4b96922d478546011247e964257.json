From Roy Nelson\u2019s loss to Frank Mir, to what\u2019s next for dual champion Ryan Bader, to which grand prix will come next and more, check below for highlights from Coker\u2019s session and be sure to watch the complete video above.\n\nOn wanting Roy Nelson to retire:\n\n\u201cI think that I go back and talk to my team about that. You know, I think Roy brought it and did his best today. It didn\u2019t work out, but we\u2019ll evaluate that. I think that it might be that time. I\u2019m not sure, but that\u2019s something that only Roy can decide. But as far as what I said on Wednesday, it\u2019s definitely a possibility.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Steve Mowry and the future of the heavyweight division:\n\n\u201cThose guys, they have very \u2013 I don\u2019t think they even have 10 fights yet. Fortune probably \u2013 how many fights does Fortune have? Maybe five, six, I\u2019m not even sure, but when the time is right, we\u2019ll do it, and I don\u2019t want to throw them into the deep water too early, because we have a lot of hope and feel that these guys are going to be the future of this company. So let them simmer a little bit more, but they\u2019ll be a shot, and they will have that opportunity. But to me, 10 is like the right number. Get them 10 fights, 12 fights then let them go fight anybody they want to fight.\n\nThe next grand prix tournament:\n\n\u201cAs far as the next weight class, I think there\u2019s two or three different divisions that we can throw a nice eight-man or even a female tournament, so I think that we\u2019ll evaluate as this featherweight tournament is going on, but it might be a female tournament at the end of the year.\u201d\n\nJake Hager\u2019s no contest:\n\n\u201cYeah, I mean, these things happen. I don\u2019t want to speculate one way or the other, but I think that we\u2019ll try to get him back in the cage as soon as possible. I know he has a very busy schedule with wrestling, and we\u2019re supportive of that, and when he\u2019s ready to come back and fight in the cage, we\u2019ll have him back when he\u2019s ready.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Ryan Bader:\n\n\u201cYeah, I talked to him the other day, and he would like to fight at light heavyweight, and that\u2019s going to be his next fight, and we\u2019ll have it announced soon because we\u2019re going to have him fight sometime in February.\n\n\u201cBader, let me tell you: He\u2019s itching to fight. He wants to fight in Japan. He wants to fight in February. He wants to \u2026 he\u2019s ready to go.\u201d", "description": "Bellator president Scott Coker reacted to Bellator 231 and offered updates on some of the organization's notable fighters after the event.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Matt Erickson", "Nolan King", "Mike Bohn", "Mma Junkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/scott-coker-bellator-231-post.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
