Full of sound and fury, the spectacle signified, again, that YouTubers and social media influencers - as many now accept - are the modern means of advertising and endorsing to the world. Or at least a new world.\n\nThis was the platform from which KSI and Logan Paul, two of the greatest stars of that sphere with 40 million subscribers, followers, or fans, traded heavy verbal blows as they came head to head at a fiery, intense face off on stage with all the chutzpah of a WWE theatrical mash up.\n\nThe YouTube stars, who first fought in the biggest white collar fight of all time (watched by 20 million last year, online of course) will fight again in Los Angeles on November 9. This time on a professional pay per view platform, live on Sky Sports Box Office this time, on DAZN in the USA, and promoted by Eddie Hearn.\n\nOn Monday night, a sold-out crowd - mainly teenagers - circled the Troxy hours out from the event. The hooting and wailing did not end - nor objects being thrown - until the two men had left the building.", "description": "It was the most unusual of boxing press conferences, at The Troxy in east London, late last night.", "authors": ["Gareth A Davies", "Boxing Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/boxing/2019/10/08/TELEMMGLPICT000212342967-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
