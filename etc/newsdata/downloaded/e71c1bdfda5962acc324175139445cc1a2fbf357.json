It has the potential to undertake a wide range of repetitive and time-consuming activities, including preparation of medicines, loading and unloading centrifuges, pipetting and handling liquids and picking up and sorting test tubes.\n\nThe mobile YuMi\u00aecould also be used in hospitals for a wide variety of logistics roles. YuMi\u00ae may be able to dispense medicines, transport them to where they are needed in hospitals, bring medical supplies to hospital staff and bed linen direct to patients\u2019 bedrooms.\n\nAt TMC Innovation Institute, ABB will develop robots that are able to carry out repetitive, delicate and mundane processes, leaving highly skilled medical and laboratory staff free to undertake more valuable roles and ultimately treat more patients. ABB analysis shows that repetitive tasks could be completed up to 50 per cent faster with automation, compared to current manual processes, with the added benefit that robots can work 24 hours a day.\n\n\u201cThe healthcare sector is undergoing significant transformation as the diagnosis and treatment of disease advances, while coping with an aging population, increasing costs and a growing worldwide shortage of medical staff. With our new healthcare research and development hub at TMC we are aiming to develop answers to these challenges \u2013 together with the best minds in academia, science and medicine,\u201d said Sami Atiya, President of ABB\u2019s Robotics and Discrete Automation business. \u201cOur experience in industrial and collaborative robotics will give us a strong basis to be able to adapt flexible automation to the healthcare sector. Together with our partners at TMC, we will develop cutting-edge robotics solutions. We are working to reduce the number of manual procedures performed by medical staff, improve the accuracy of laboratory work and enhance patient satisfaction and ultimately patient safety.\u201d\n\nOther technologies showcased by ABB at the Healthcare Research Hub include YuMi\u00ae robots that could aid in centrifuge tending and test tube handling systems, and an IRB 1200 robot that could execute liquid transfers in a pipetting application. All are common medical laboratory tasks that robotic automation may be able to support by combining consistent performance with a level of flexibility and continuous operation that could increase throughput and quality while minimizing costs.\n\nTMC is the largest medical city in the world with world-class collaborative research resources, including some of the world\u2019s leading companies and hospitals. ABB\u2019s new 5,300 sq ft (500m2) Healthcare Hub will be housed at the TMC Innovation Institute, a state-of-the-art hub that fosters collaboration of medicine and cutting-edge technology, connecting start-ups with pioneers in academia and leading technology companies in order to accelerate the development and prototyping of breakthrough medical technology.\n\n\u201cTexas Medical Center, TMC Innovation, and the entire TMC network of member institutions are pleased to welcome ABB on the occasion of its first foray into the healthcare space with this incredible and unprecedented new robotics facility,\u201d emphasized Bill McKeon, President & CEO of Texas Medical Center. He added, \u201cA primary goal across TMC \u2013 the largest medical city in the world \u2013 is to make research happen faster while simultaneously cutting costs in order to create more rapid and cost-effective solutions for patients who are in desperate need of treatment. ABB\u2019s move into the heart of the Texas Medical Center campus with this first-of-its-kind R&D facility for creating robotics solutions in healthcare will set a new course for advancements in medicine and establish TMC as the nexus for a new kind of synergistic partnership that will shape the future of healthcare for clinicians, researchers, and patients alike.\u201d\n\nRobotic automation in the healthcare sector offers significant opportunity for future growth. According to internal ABB research, the global market is estimated to reach nearly 60,000 non-surgical medical robots by 2025, a fourfold increase from 2018.\n\nWatch the video:https://youtu.be/SA_1vfH5UIk\n\nMedia b-roll: https://drive.google.com/file/d/13r9gjaXpLCZmJ69m6m6YyVDM9ONkauQO/view\n\nABB (ABBN: SIX Swiss Ex) is a technology leader that is driving the digital transformation of industries.
