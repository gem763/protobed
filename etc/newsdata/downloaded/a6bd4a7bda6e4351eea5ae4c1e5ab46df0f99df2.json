However, his lawyer said that the Justice Department feels it can be legally withheld, the Times reported.\n\nSchumer is now urging his Senate colleagues to subpoena the report, arguing along with Pelosi that it is, in fact, illegal for it to be kept from lawmakers.", "description": "The judge and judicial analyst is arguing that reports of Trump's alleged requests for election help are worse than any scandal ever seen under his tenure.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d89473d2100001508ebdef4.jpeg?cache=ymcdlgg4ig&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
