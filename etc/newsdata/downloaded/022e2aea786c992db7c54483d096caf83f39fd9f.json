And your governor and other state officials may be kept in the dark, too.\n\nThere\u2019s no federal law compelling state and local governments to share information when an electoral system is hacked. And a federal policy keeps details secret by shielding the identity of all cyber victims regardless of whether election systems are involved.\n\nElection officials are in a difficult spot: If someone else\u2019s voting system is targeted, they want to know exactly what happened so they can protect their own system. Yet when their own systems are targeted, they may be cautious about disclosing details. They must balance the need for openness with worries over undermining any criminal investigation. And they want to avoid chaos or confusion \u2014 the kind of disruption that hackers want.\n\nThe secrecy surrounding foreign hacks is not a hypothetical issue. The public still doesn\u2019t know which Florida counties were breached by Russian agents in the 2016 election. Rick Scott, Florida\u2019s governor in 2016 and now a U.S. senator, was not told at the time and didn\u2019t learn most of the details until this year.\n\nAnd the threat to electoral systems is real. Federal officials believe Russian agents in 2016 searched for vulnerabilities within election systems in all 50 states. And the nation\u2019s intelligence chiefs warn that Russia and other nations remain interested in interfering in U.S. elections.\n\nMeanwhile, experts worry the White House hasn\u2019t highlighted the threat as President Donald Trump argues it\u2019s OK for foreign countries to provide damaging information on his political rivals \u2014 a matter now the subject of an impeachment inquiry led by House Democrats.\n\nIn general, it\u2019s up to electoral agencies to disclose when they\u2019ve been hacked. That, plus the federal policy protecting the identity of cyber victims, could mean that state election officials might not be told immediately if one of their local election offices experiences a breach. In addition, the whole situation could be considered classified as part of a federal investigation.\n\nAt least two states \u2014 Colorado and Iowa \u2014 have implemented policies to compel local officials to notify the state about suspected breaches involving election systems.\n\n\u201cEvery American in this nation deserves to have a democracy they can believe in, and when there is not good communication on cyber incidents \u2026 it does create a lack of confidence in the system,\u201d said Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold. \u201cLuckily we have been able to work around the void of federal policy that has been leaving our nation in a precarious spot.\u201d\n\nBut Department of Homeland Security officials say privacy is needed to ensure that officials come forward and share valuable threat information, such as suspect IP addresses.\n\nSome election officials could be hesitant about public disclosures, concerned their agencies would be portrayed in a negative light. They could opt to handle any breach alone.\n\nThat could create dangerous delays in sharing information, said Jeanette Manfra, assistant director for cybersecurity at Homeland Security\u2019s new cyber agency.\n\nHomeland Security acts as the middleman between the intelligence community and the states. In general, communication and coordination on election security have improved in the last two years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked over the years to be able to declassify even more and to do it faster,\u201d Manfra said. \u201cIt\u2019s still not a perfect process.\u201d\n\nDue to the criminal nature of cyber breaches, law enforcement officials may seek to withhold releasing certain information long after the incident. When Florida\u2019s current governor, Ron DeSantis, was briefed this year on the 2016 cyber breaches, he said he signed an agreement preventing him from identifying the affected counties.\n\nThe secrecy surrounding Florida helped spur bipartisan legislation that would compel reporting among federal, state and local officials and to voters potentially affected by a breach. Rep. Stephanie Murphy, a Florida Democrat, co-sponsor of the bill, said she believes voters are the victims, not the election office, and that not disclosing information about election-related breaches could undermine public confidence.\n\nIn June, a majority of Americans expressed at least some concern that voting systems are vulnerable to hackers, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to assess if what people are doing in response is sufficient when I don\u2019t know the full scope of the problem,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s the same issue with voters: How can they feel comfortable or confident that this next election will be free and fair?\u201d\n\nYet election officials want to ensure they have a good understanding of what happened before going public so they don\u2019t contribute to the confusion that the hackers may be trying to achieve.\n\nCyber intrusions are inherently complicated, taking time to understand and contain. There is also a concern of inadvertently releasing information that could invite further compromises or undermine an investigation.\n\n\u201cIt is important to be as transparent as possible, but as with any crime, the full details of an investigation are not discussed,\u201d said Paul Pate, Iowa\u2019s Republican secretary of state. \u201cIt\u2019s a balancing act that needs to be measured on a case-by-case basis.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, California election officials quickly disclosed the state had been notified by federal officials that its election systems were among those scanned by Russians the year before. Five days later, they had to correct the announcement after discovering the scans involved a non-election system. Secretary of State Alex Padilla, a Democrat, said it was an important lesson in making sure all the facts were there, especially considering the public is not familiar with cybersecurity terminology.\n\nIn the summer of 2016, hackers accessed Illinois\u2019 voter registration database, and officials moved fast to shut down the system and isolate the threat. State officials knew the move wouldn\u2019t go unnoticed and felt it was important to notify the public.\n\nIt became clear only later that Russian agents were involved, and the breach was part of an unprecedented campaign to interfere in U.S. elections.\n\nMatt Dietrich, spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections, said it would be hard to imagine that any election office would seek to keep something like that quiet today.\n\n\u201cIn 2016, it was a story and then it was dealt with and then it kind of went away for a year,\u201d Dietrich said. \u201cThat is not going to happen this time. It will be a national and a worldwide story. We all know this. We all know we are going to be under the microscope.\u201d\n\n___\n\nCassidy reported from Atlanta.
