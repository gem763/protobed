This, in turn, draws oxygen up from beneath, according to the firm\n\nPollogen unveiled the product in an Indiegogo campaign this month for a discounted $109 ahead of its official release next year, when it will retail at $229. It's available in three pastel colors\n\nThe campaign has already raised more than $110,000 on Indiegogo, touting the ability to rejuvenate your face in a matter of minutes.\n\nGeneo Personal is currently priced at $109 for early-birds, and comes in three pastel colors: powder pink, mint green, and white.\n\nThe device itself measures just under 5-inches long and weighs less than a pound. When it\u2019s not in use, it fits into a discreet charging stand.\n\nAnd, according to the firm, it will give you an Instagram-ready appearance \u2013 no filter necessary.\n\nHANDS-ON WITH THE GENEO PERSONAL OXYGENATION DEVICE Dailymail.com tested out the Geneo Personal device in powder pink What strikes me first about Pollogen's latest device is its minimalist design. It fits perfectly in the palm of your hand, and the charging dock takes up little room on a dresser or counter-top. The device itself is straightforward to use, and to the joy of those who prefer instant gratification, the results are immediately apparent. I used Geneo Personal for about three weeks and was impressed by the effects on my skin. Unlike many other exfoliating devices which can leave your skin feeling raw, Geneo Personal provides a gentle treatment that cleans your face without making it feel as though it's been rubbed by sandpaper. The moment I was officially sold, however, came after a long weekend of camping. This device made for the most refreshing post-camping scrub I've ever had, leaving my face feeling fresh and dewy. The price-tag is undeniably hefty - especially for those who don't catch the Early Bird - but it's certainly a steal in the long-term if you consider the alternative of going out to get expensive facials at the salon.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a 3-in-1 facial experience, because it Oxygenates, Exfoliates, and Nourishes your skin in just 6 minutes,\u2019 said Sharon Ravic, CEO of Pollogen.\n\n\u2018We put our face through a lot every day, exposing it to the sun\u2019s harsh rays and air pollutants. It\u2019s time to unlock the skin\u2019s natural potential by raising the oxygen levels in our skin cells.\n\n\u2018Throw out the brush heads and bring on the bubbles.\u2019\n\nGeneo Personal is expected to begin shipping February 2019.", "description": "Israeli beauty-tech firm Pollogen has launched its Geneo Personal device, which stimulates oxygen from beneath the skin\u2019s surface to give you a clearer, fresher face within minutes.", "authors": ["Cheyenne Macdonald For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/16/22/5103536-0-image-a-20_1539725072785.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-16"}
