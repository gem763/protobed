But this is not the week to observe that we don\u2019t see much of her, because in Hustlers we see most of her.\n\nIt is a film inspired by a true story, about a bunch of stripper/prostitutes who prey on wealthy customers, drugging the men and fraudulently using their credit cards.\n\nLopez is terrific, and while I can\u2019t claim to be an expert, it\u2019s hard to imagine even a professional pole-dancer looking more at ease astride a pole.\n\nJennifer Lopez (pictured right) plays a pole-dancer in this new film Hustlers which is inspired by a true story of strippers who are preyed upon by wealthy customers. It revovles around It\u2019s simply lots of sleazy men being taken for a sleazy ride\n\nShe plays Ramona, an experienced stripper who acts as mentor to newcomer Destiny (Constance Wu), and teaches her all the pole moves \u2014 the stag, the reverse stag, the scissor-sit, the half-nelson, or maybe I\u2019m beginning to think back to ITV\u2019s Saturday-afternoon wrestling. At any rate, there\u2019s quite a repertoire.\n\nThe story pings between 2007 and 2014, when a journalist (Julia Stiles) piecing the story together interviews all the protagonists.\n\nFollowing the 2008 financial crash, pole-dancers suffer a direct hit; the Wall Street bankers don\u2019t flash the cash like they used to.\n\nSo Ramona thinks, why don\u2019t the strippers start stripping the assets of bankers who still like to party, and who, after all, were responsible for the mess everyone\u2019s in?\n\nThey begin spiking men\u2019s drinks with a cocktail of ketamine and MDMA, two drugs which together make the victims woozily incapable of protecting their pin numbers.\n\nWe see this happening a lot, which is where the narrative suffers. This is not a sophisticated scam and the film is not The Sting, or American Hustle, or even Ocean\u2019s Eight. It\u2019s simply lots of sleazy men being taken for a sleazy ride.\n\nWriter-director Lorene Scafaria does her best not to make the women look sleazy, too \u2014 they\u2019re just trying to earn a buck to support their grannies, kids, themselves \u2014 but with limited success. Nor can she stop Hustlers getting rather tiresomely repetitive.\n\nShe tries to jolly things up with a lively soundtrack and other devices such as slow-motion, but not even a slow-mo J-Lo can quite overcome the paucity of the plot.\n\nStill, among the largely female audience at the screening I attended, it went down great guns. It would make the perfect hen party film \u2014 unless the stags are out on the same night, heading for a strip joint.\n\nA right royal return to Downton!\n\nDownton Abbey (PG)\n\nVerdict: Back in the Abbey bit\n\nRating:\n\nAn early Seventies episode of Upstairs, Downstairs, an ITV period drama of beloved memory, revolved around a visit to the big house in Belgravia by the King and Queen.\n\nIt was a good hook then from which to hang myriad storylines about class, deference, snobbery and anxiety, and it remains one now, as an ITV period drama of much fresher memory, although no less beloved, is given a big-screen makeover.\n\nThe eagerly-awaited film version of Downton Abbey arrives in cinemas today, following Monday\u2019s widely-publicised world premiere in London. That was already my second viewing of a movie which gives us what we never expected to see: the Earl of Grantham\u2019s second chin wobbling in empathy, Mr Carson\u2019s eyebrows beetling in consternation, the Dowager Countess of Grantham\u2019s lips pursed in disapproval, all in gigantic silver-screen form.\n\nThe Downton Abbey cast are back in this film-version full of compacted plots and sub-plots, some compelling, some preposterous, some purring with early promise then fizzling out, just like on the telly\n\nThe characters pick up pretty much from where they were last set down.\n\nMr Carson (Jim Carter), Downton\u2019s steadfast former butler, now spends his days seeing to his cabbages (real ones, not a reference to Daisy the dim-witted kitchen maid).\n\nBut soon he is summoned out of retirement to help prepare for the visit of King George V (Simon Jones) and Queen Mary (Geraldine James).\n\nThere is a marvellous moment when, granite of both countenance and purpose, he strides bowler-hatted down the drive towards the great house.\n\nAn unseen orchestra swells, as when anything momentous happens in movies. Sylvester Stallone as Rocky rising from the canvas, John Wayne squaring up to the Comanche, Carson returning to ensure the kedgeree is on the sideboard in time for breakfast, that sort of thing.\n\nJim Carter stars as Charles Carson in the movie which is just a miniature of the TV series\n\nActually, that\u2019s where the challenge lay for Downton\u2019s creator Julian Fellowes, who wrote the screenplay. Could he and U.S. director Michael Engler, a TV veteran without much feature-film experience, really make their story properly cinematic?\n\nThe answer is yes, up to a point. The lavish production values and meticulous period detail, last seen on TV on Christmas Day 2015, transfer splendidly to the big screen.\n\nBut in essence, even though the characters are 10ft high, this film is nothing more, nor anything less, than an entire series in miniature. It is full of compacted plots and sub-plots, some compelling, some preposterous, some purring with early promise then fizzling out, just like on the telly.\n\nKnitting them all together is the overnight stay of the King and Queen, during a royal tour of Yorkshire. It is 1927. At dinner, His Majesty wonders whether old Lady Grantham (Maggie Smith) was affected by the social upheaval caused by the previous year\u2019s General Strike?\n\n\u2018My maid was rather curt with me,\u2019 she tells him, a nice reminder that Fellowes is capable of writing very funny dialogue. As ever, much of it comes from Dame Maggie\u2019s mouth, spat out past the plums.\n\nDownton fans know she is at her most comical when she is in high dudgeon. Here, her dudgeon could hardly be higher.\n\nThe Queen\u2019s lady-in-waiting, Lady Maud Bagshaw (Imelda Staunton), is her cousin, but they have fallen out over the question of who will inherit Lady Bagshaw\u2019s fortune.\n\nThe Countess believes it should be her own son, the 7th Earl (Hugh Bonneville). Lady B has other ideas. Meanwhile, there is similar indignation below stairs, what perhaps we might call low dudgeon, because the King\u2019s pompous butler (David Haig) has informed the servants that the royal household will be taking over their jobs for the duration of the royal visit.\n\nThis means that Mrs Patmore the cook (Lesley Nicol) is to be usurped by a comedy Frenchman (Philippe Spall). She\u2019s understandably furious, as we would all be if a comedy Frenchman elbowed us out of ze way, demanding ze vanilla pods. But dopey Daisy (Sophie McShera) can\u2019t fathom why anyone cares.\n\nThere used to be a time when Daisy couldn\u2019t fathom anything. She barely seemed to know her own name, let alone a coulis from a consomm\u00e9. But actually Daisy has discovered confidence. \u2018All this fuss for a man and woman we don\u2019t even know,\u2019 she chirps.\n\nThe counterbalance to Daisy\u2019s firebrand republicanism is the ardent royalism of Mr Molesley the footman, beautifully played for laughs by Kevin Doyle (who claims to have borrowed his awkward curtsey from Theresa May).\n\nYet republicanism rears its brazen head elsewhere in the story; how and where I must let you find out for yourself.\n\nWhat you can probably guess, however, is that the Downton staff contrive to get the better of the royal retinue, albeit in ways that belong more to the plotting of a Chuckle Brothers sketch than a grown-up feature film.\n\nMeanwhile, the sub-plots come thick and fast.\n\nSomeone has been pinching silver knick-knacks. The boiler\u2019s broken, although we know the oven still works because \u2014 spoiler alert \u2014 Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael) has a bun in it.\n\nAnd Tom Branson (Allen Leech), the Irish former chauffeur who upset a whole row of applecarts by marrying Lady Sybil (RIP), has taken a shine to Lady Bagshaw\u2019s fragrant maid (Tuppence Middleton).\n\nThere are broader issues to grapple with, too.\n\nFellowes has a tasteful little grapple with Twenties attitudes to homosexuality by making Mr Barrow (Rob James-Collier) fall for a chap in the royal household, while Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) is beginning to wonder whether the heyday of great landed families might be over.\n\nIndeed, she\u2019s so remarkably modern she uses the term \u2018conspiracy theory\u2019 fully 40 years before it was coined.\n\nStill, Fellowes can be forgiven the odd anachronism, and for squeezing in too many storylines. After all, they are only there as springboards for our favourite characters.\n\nHappily, creepy Mr Bates (Brendan Coyle) doesn\u2019t get much more than a limp-on part, to the relief of those of us who still rather wish he\u2019d gone to the scaffold in series five.\n\nAnd that, finally, is the key to enjoying this movie.\n\nThere\u2019s absolutely no point seeing it if you don\u2019t already know who all these people are. If you do, how can you possibly resist?\n\nA shorter version of this review ran in Tuesday\u2019s paper.\n\nLove, life and childbirth in a film to break your heart\n\nFor Sama (18)\n\nVerdict: Gripping documentary\n\nRating:\n\nFor Sama is a gripping Arabic-language film about the Syrian civil war, set in the beleaguered city of Aleppo, and containing the single most extraordinary image I\u2019ve seen in documentary cinema if not ever, then certainly all year.\n\nThe co-director, with the British filmmaker Edward Watts, is Waad al-Kateab, who has constructed it as a kind of love letter to her young daughter, Sama. It is also a letter of apology, full of contrition on behalf of her and her doctor husband for bringing Sama into a world where Russian warplanes deliberately drop bombs on hospitals, to break the spirit of those rebelling against the dictatorship of Russia\u2019s ally, President Assad.\n\nIt chronicles the fight, not so much against Assad, as to stay alive and unbroken.\n\nBritish filmmaker Edward Watts has joined up with Waad al-Kateab to createthis gribbing Arabic-language film For Sama which illustrates the fight to stay alive and unbroken during the Syrian civil war\n\nSmall events assume huge meaning, such as a man giving his thrilled wife a persimmon in a city devoid of fruit and vegetables.\n\nAs for that extraordinary image, it comes about two-thirds of the way through, when a mother in the final stages of pregnancy is caught in a bomb blast.\n\nShe seems to be dead. So does her baby, delivered by Caesarean section, despite the best efforts of the medics to find life.\n\nI\u2019ll say no more. But if you can find this documentary, see it.", "description": "BRIAN VINER: Jennifer Lopez's role in Hustlers is terrific and documents a world where sleazy men preyed upon prostitutes between 2007-2014.
