And what a legacy Rep. Elijah Cummings Elijah Eugene CummingsCracks emerge in White House strategy as witness testifies Overnight Defense: Pentagon insists US hasn't abandoned Kurds | Trump expands sanctions authority against Turkey | Ex-Ukraine ambassador says Trump pushed for her ouster On The Money: Trump announces limited trade deal with China | Appeals court rules against Trump over financial records | Trump expands authority to sanction Turkey MORE (D-Md.) has left for us.\n\nThurgood Marshall once said, \u201cNone of us has gotten where we are solely by pulling ourselves up from our bootstraps. We got here because somebody bent down and helped us.\u201d\n\nThe legacy Elijah Cummings has given to us is a lesson in bending down and helping others. From the home of a sharecropper he learned hard work, humility and perseverance. When he was at the University of Maryland School of Law, he learned the power of the rule of law and the importance of \u201cjustice for all.\u201d On the streets of Baltimore, he learned what happens when a community is forgotten and justice is rare. But the most important lesson he would learn is what it meant to be a servant, and a leader.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Gospels were a core part of Rep. Cummings\u2019s story. It was how he did his job each day \u2014 to be of service to others and to \u201cbe not afraid,\u201d especially in the face of those who would ridicule him and the work he did on behalf of his community. He would often remind us of the simplicity of his mission: \u201cI want justice, oceans of it. I want fairness, rivers of it. That\u2019s what I want. That\u2019s all I want.\u201d\n\nBut more important, Rep. Cummings would also hold steady the nation\u2019s moral compass, while keeping his finger on the pulse of his neighborhood and his city, mindful of their problems but also of their possibilities.\n\nWhile the congressman and I would butt heads from time to time on various policies, when it came to Baltimore we agreed: It was no longer enough to have a seat at the lunch counter, it was time to own the diner \u2014 and he got to make the sausage.\n\nHe wrote some of the nation\u2019s toughest drug policies. \u201cYou have to understand, I come from a neighborhood where 'The Wire' was filmed,\u201d he said. He also pushed for economic empowerment in underserved communities, declaring: \u201cBaltimore will do extremely well, but that\u2019s not the question. The question is whether all of Baltimore will rise together, or will we leave some behind?\"\n\nRep. Cummings made certain to put first the best interests of both the community he represented and the nation he loved. Today, so many of us stand taller because Elijah Cummings bent down; today we are stronger because Elijah Cummings uplifted a new generation of men and women who have been cut from the hem of his coattail.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI am honored to have spent time with him, learned from him, battled with him and to have watched firsthand how he managed the complexities of leadership.\n\nBy his example we would come to appreciate the patriot, the fighter, the man who was unafraid to draw us away from the partisan edge. Instead, he would tell us to remember that, one day, an accounting of our leadership would come due: \u201cWhen we\u2019re dancing with the angels, the question will be asked, 'In 2019, what did we do to make sure we kept our democracy intact? Did we stand on the sidelines and say nothing?' \u201d\n\nBut now we are left to grieve for a dear friend and, in our grief, we turn for understanding and consolation.\n\nPsalm 30:5 reminds us that \u201cweeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning.\u201d We are encouraged to embrace Elijah Cummings\u2019s life not with a \u201cvale of tears\u201d but with the joy of having known him. We are richer because he believed in our possibilities, and even more grateful for the man who knew how to make the sausage.\n\nMy condolences for the family of Rep. Cummings. Their loss is personal, but it is shared by so many whose lives were touched by him. While we mourn with them, we also celebrate with them the life of a great man \u2014 a mentor, a friend, a servant and a leader.\n\nMichael Steele is the former Republican National Committee chairman and former lieutenant governor of Maryland.
