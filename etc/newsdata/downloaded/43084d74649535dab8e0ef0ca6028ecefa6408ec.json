These people can easily fall victim to investment scams and other cons, he says, and a number unknowingly become money-laundering mules.\n\nCommon Scams\n\nPigeon-drop scams: With these scams, victims are told that a considerable sum of money was found and will be shared with them if an upfront payment is received. According to the AIG survey, 60% of respondents weren\u2019t aware of pigeon-drop scams.\n\nRomance scams: It\u2019s bad enough that victims can be swindled out of their savings by someone pretending to love and care about them, but some of these scams also can lead seniors even further down the rabbit hole by causing them to engage unwittingly in criminal behavior. Some money-laundering scams start with a budding \u201cromance\u201d in exchange for money. Once a level of trust develops, the scammer persuades the person to deposit money, often in the form of checks or wire transfers, on the scammer\u2019s behalf with the instructions to send that money to someone else. The AIG survey showed 57% weren\u2019t even aware of romance scams.\n\nPrepaid credit- and debit-card scams: This is where victims are asked to make payments\u2014often multiple ones\u2014to a utility or other company to address a debt. The survey found 52% of respondents weren\u2019t aware of such scams.\n\nThere are so many scams out there beyond these that it\u2019s hard to avoid encountering a would-be fraudster, but there are some ways to decrease the likelihood that you\u2019ll be a victim, says Odette Williamson, a staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center who works on elder issues.\n\nProtective Measures\n\nRecognize the warning signs. Seniors who are lonely or experiencing cognitive decline can be particularly susceptible to financial scams. Families should be wary if their loved one mentions an out-of-the-blue romance, or starts to make large withdrawals from bank or investment accounts.\n\nCall authorities. These types of crimes are often under-reported because victims are embarrassed to come forward, says Wolverton, a former agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation who consults as a financial investigator in fraud cases. It can be even trickier when family fraud comes into play, which is one reason federal authorities have started to push financial institutions to take a more proactive role when certain activities seem suspicious.\n\nIf fraud is suspected, Wolverton recommends filing a report first with the local police department and putting the retiree\u2019s bank on notice to watch for suspicious activity. Having this documentation can provide a chain of evidence to help federal officials break up larger operations.\n\nWebsites for government agencies such as the FBI, Internal Revenue Service, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service can also direct seniors and their families on how to report suspected fraud.And if the internet is involved, seniors or their families can file an online complaint with the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center.\n\nReduce phone calls. Since most scams are perpetrated over the telephone, Williamson says, seniors should consider registering their numbers with the National Do Not Call Registry maintained by the Federal Trade Commission. They also should refrain from making purchases over the phone.\n\nCheck statements. Retirees or their caretakers should review bank and credit-card statements regularly to make sure all of the charges are authorized. Family members may also consider getting permission to monitor their loved one\u2019s financial transactions remotely. And if there are caretakers in the home, don\u2019t give them a credit card, Williamson says. Instead, give them a debit card with limited funds.\n\nKnow consumer rights. The FTC Cooling-Off Rule gives consumers a three-day right to cancel certain purchases for a full refund. The rule applies to \u201cdoor-to-door sales\u201d and covers these types of transactions as well as those made at a seller\u2019s temporary location such as a hotel room or convention center or at an in-home presentation. There are several exceptions, but it\u2019s worth noting that in a number of instances consumers can simply change their minds about a purchase\u2014no questions asked. In these instances, they \u201cdon\u2019t have to have a reason for canceling,\u201d Williamson says.\n\nQuestions? Comments?
