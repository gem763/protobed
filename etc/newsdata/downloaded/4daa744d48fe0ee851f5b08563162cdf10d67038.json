And how fortunate they are with their goal is bordering on a joke.\n\n'They are now fighting to get into the top four. You really don't want to move into the new stadium and within one season you are not in the Champions League. Something's going on there.\n\nHe is yet to win any silverware at Spurs and Merson thinks that should be crucial to his decision\n\n'I don't know what it is but this team, with the quality it has, can't be turning in performances like they have done.\n\n'If you are someone like Harry Kane, you've got to be sitting down at the end of the season and thinking: \"What am I going to do? Am I going to stay here and win absolutely nothing? Or do I go on and try and win something in my career?\"\n\n'I'm not having a dig at Tottenham, but you play to win in your career. Winning is the reason you play the game.'", "description": "Mauricio Pochettino's side are seventh in the Premier League with just two wins in their last five games, and they also fell to a 7-2 defeat at home in the Champions League against Bayern Munich.", "authors": ["Amitai Winehouse For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/17/20044198-0-image-a-293_1571760729498.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
