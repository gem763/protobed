Buck had previously been charged in Moore\u2019s death after his arrest last month.\n\nBuck, 65, who is white and has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democratic causes, preyed on vulnerable men, most of them black, some of them homeless and addicted to drugs, and pressured them to take drugs or let him inject them with narcotics as part of sexual activity known as \u201cparty and play,\u201d prosecutors said.\n\nA defense lawyer has previously said Buck denies a role in both deaths. Lawyers for Buck, who is being held without bail, did not immediately return emails seeking comment on the indictment.\n\nThe five-count indictment includes a charge in Dean\u2019s death and adds charges that Buck provided meth to three other men.\n\nDetails of those encounters were included in an affidavit filed with a criminal complaint last month in federal court.\n\nIn one encounter, an escort who said he was paid $300 for his services in December, told detectives that Buck gave him a drink and he lost control of his body and passed out, according to court documents. When he regained consciousness, Buck was approaching him with two syringes loaded with meth and he made an excuse to leave the apartment.\n\nIn a second incident that month, the same escort said Buck gave him what he said was meth, but the man thought it was actually a tranquilizer because he was immobilized on the floor for more than six hours. Buck told the man to leave, but he couldn\u2019t move.\n\nBuck then became frustrated and threatened him with a buzzing power saw, the man said, according to the affidavit. A surge of adrenalin helped him get to his feet, retreat to the kitchen and he eventually left.\n\nAnother man said he met Buck in June on Adam4Adam, a gay dating and escort site, while he was living in a hotel on Skid Row in Los Angeles.\n\nThe man ended up living with Buck for part of the summer and said Buck injected him with meth on nearly a daily basis for five weeks, according to the affidavit.\n\nHe said he overdosed Sept. 4 and 11 when Buck injected him each time with two syringes of meth. On the final time, he said Buck also gave him GHB, the powerful sedative often referred to as a date-rape drug. He again felt he was overdosing and asked Buck to call an ambulance.\n\nWhen Buck refused, the man left the apartment and went to a nearby gas station, where someone called an ambulance that took him to the hospital.\n\nThat final encounter led to Buck\u2019s arrest _ more than two years after activists began staging rallies outside his rent-controlled apartment and pressuring the local district attorney to bring charges in the July 27, 2017 death of Moore, 26.\n\nJasmyne Cannick, a communications strategist who led the effort to seek justice for Moore, said the indictment was a long time in coming and that learning it had been handed down was an \u201cincredible feeling.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo finally see this come to a reality, it\u2019s more than I imagined,\u201d Cannick said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the fight you\u2019re not thinking about the victory part because we had so many downs, very little ups until quite recently. Nobody believed us, no one took us seriously.\u201d\n\nMoore\u2019s mother and her supporters have questioned why it took so long to bring charges and have suggested Buck got favorable treatment because of his status and reputation and that the victims were ignored because they were gay black men, drug users and often sex workers. The activists had repeatedly warned that if Buck wasn\u2019t stopped, others would die.\n\nFive months after Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey declined to bring charges in Moore\u2019s death, Dean, 55, was found dead Jan. 7 on the floor of Buck\u2019s living room _ the same place Moore died.\n\nDean\u2019s sister thanked supporters, activists, federal prosecutors and a detective who worked the case.\n\n\u201cMy family is overjoyed with the news today,\u201d Joann Campbell said in a statement. \u201cEd Buck, you will never hurt and cause harm to another family.\u201d", "description": "Wealthy California political donor Ed Buck was indicted Wednesday by a federal grand jury for two overdose deaths in his West Hollywood apartment and charged with providing methamphetamine to three other men, one of whom survived two overdoses.
