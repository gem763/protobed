This discrete safari camp would be a veritable oasis if not for the fact that there are no trees hereabouts and the tents appear to have evolved from the dunes. It is the only privately operated camp in the Cape Range National Park, which has itself been sequestrated from surrounding pastoral stations.\n\nThe sublime location of Sal Salis Ningaloo Reef resort.\n\nTo get here, I have travelled from Exmouth to the north via a road that sweeps past a caravan park owned by mining magnate Andrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forrest (primed for resort-style development) and along an empty stretch of orange dirt rimmed by a ribbon of blue sea.\n\nThe ocean is an extension of the dunes, the dunes\u2019 earthly ripples sent from the ocean. All of it is encompassed in the UNESCO heritage listing, and so this human settlement must operate according to regulations as strict as those pertaining to the marine park.\n\nEvery 'room' has a view and is within easy reach of the beach.\n\nMy tent is tucked behind the dunes, a capsule of understated luxury that gives concession to its fragile environment \u2013 long-drop toilets, a limited allocation of water, power that is mostly solar-generated. When the camp is dismantled at the end of the dry season in November, little evidence of its existence will be left behind.\n\nYardie Creek Gorge in Cape Range National Park, north of Ningaloo Reef. Catherine Marshall\n\nBeyond the coastal plain lie jagged gullies and ridges, a landscape enlivened by the fluorescent new leaves of kurrajong trees. At Yardie Creek \u2013 as far south as the road will take us \u2013 Sal Salis guide Cheyenne Riddle points out warty apple bushes protruding from cracks in the rock and bush figs ripening on the tree.\n\n\u201cThe fruit goes from green to yellow to purple,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re a really good source of food for the rock wallabies that live here.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAppearing on cue, the wallabies leap around the rock face, textured feet and long tails improving their dexterity. Undercut by waterways and sink holes and caves, this immense karst was once an ocean floor; fossils are embedded in it, brain-shaped imprints marooned from the ocean nearby.\n\nThat night, I leave the tent flaps open and am cooled by a southerly washing off the sea. In the morning, it\u2019s just a few steps from breakfast to the beach, and a handful of strokes from the shore to the reef.\n\nBack at camp after a hard day's swimming and exploring.\n\nMy mask is a portal to the past, for beneath the water\u2019s surface is a vision of what that limestone slab might have looked like at the beginning of time: an endless forest of sculpted corals shot through with glittering sunrays and bright, darting fish. It\u2019s the Garden of Eden, submerged beneath the limpid waters of a remote West Australian seashore.\n\nThe Milky Way tends to steal the show at night.\n\nNEED TO KNOW\n\n\n\nGetting there Qantas operates daily flights from Perth to Exmouth.
