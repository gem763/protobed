Illustration: Jeanne Verdoux\n\nWhat does it actually feel like to be pregnant? Stretch marks, kicks \u2014 theoretically, at least, you\u2019re prepared for these things to happen, even if you can\u2019t quite imagine how. But there are plenty of things you aren\u2019t prepared for at all. For example: You are probably not prepared to smell like a sandwich.\n\nThis one came to us from Angela Garbes, author of Like a Mother: A Feminist Journey Through the Science and Culture of Pregnancy.\n\nANGELA: One of my best friends told me how, in her pregnancy, she developed this really specific BO that she called, like, an Italian sub. She was like, \u201cIt was like a combination of, like, raw onion and, like, vinegar.\u201d\n\nAnd we heard from other anonymous listeners and friends about the things you don\u2019t expect when you\u2019re expecting:\n\n\u201cThe most surprising thing that happened to me when I was pregnant was that I realized I had two extra nipples.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth times I was pregnant, my butt went flat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI grew extremely long eyebrow hairs. Like, they would dip down into my eyes. Like, one stray hair kind of clinging over the top of my glasses.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got a varicose vein on my clitoris.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe shape of my cornea actually changed. I wear contacts and they just felt like they were scratching my eyeballs. And so I went to my optometrist and told him, and I mentioned that I was pregnant. And he immediately said, like, \u2018Oh. Yeah, your eyes have completely changed shape.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter 12 years of working in front of a computer, my first pregnancy gave me carpal tunnel syndrome. What the fuck?\u201d\n\nLots of them told us that pregnancy was a time of extreme horniness.\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m a woman in my 50s now, but I\u2019ve raised two girls, and I remember quite distinctly during both pregnancies how surprised I was by how horny I was all the time \u2026 I never have wanted it that much in my life, ever.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust like walking around could get me close to orgasm.\u201d\n\n\u201cI grew up in a really Evangelical culture where I was often told that men think about sex every seven seconds and I always found that to be doubtable as I became an adult. but then when I was pregnant, I started to feel like maybe I understand that.\u201d\n\nTo hear more stories about the unexpected realities of pregnancy \u2014 from people like Rukmini Callimachi and many more \u2014 click above, and subscribe wherever you listen.", "description": "During this week\u2019s episode of The Cut on Tuesdays, we talked to women about the things they weren\u2019t expecting during pregnancy.", "authors": ["The Cut"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/30/30-podcast-feed.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
