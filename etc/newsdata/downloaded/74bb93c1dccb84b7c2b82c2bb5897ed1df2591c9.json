Incidentally, so was Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, the Hawaii Democrat whom Clinton had just called a \u201cfavorite of Russians\u201d in the 2020 race, prompting Gabbard to accuse Clinton of being \u201cthe queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\u201d\n\nAnyway, I decided to go.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHeld at the posh Mandarin Oriental hotel, Fortune\u2019s conference is the kind of event where the seminars have titles like, \u201cCo-Opetition: From Competition to Cooperation,\u201d and where the hallways are lined with pressed-juice stands, and pop-up Dior counters providing mini-makeovers, and many, many advertisements for M.M. LaFleur, which is a clothing brand you never need know exists unless you reach a certain age and income level, at which point its logo will stalk you on Facebook. \u201cM.M. LaFleur Live with Purpose. Dress with Ease.\u201d\n\nWandering around on Monday and Tuesday (using a press pass, not my life savings), I caught sessions featuring congresswomen Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), Old Navy CEO Sonia Syngal and feminist icon Anita Hill. The COO of Rothy\u2019s shoes was there, talking about how to build a viral brand, and so were dozen of audience members wearing Rothy\u2019s shoes \u2014 evidence that the COO knows of what she speaks \u2014 and I am not going to lie, I was wearing Rothy\u2019s, too.\n\nThe summit is one of those why-the-hell-not events, is what I\u2019m saying. As in, I certainly wouldn\u2019t pay for it, but if you want to, go ahead. It\u2019s no weirder than many manly conferences with booths showcasing the latest golf club technology. It\u2019s Goop, but with its feet rooted more on the ground.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nExcept then, abruptly, it wasn\u2019t. Because Anita Hill finished her Q&A, and the audience members ate our fancy \u201cNetworking Lunch,\u201d and then suddenly it was Kirstjen Nielsen on the brightly lit ballroom stage, determinedly dodging every question posed to her by \u201cPBS NewsHour\u2019s\u201d Amna Nawaz.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t regret enforcing the law because I took an oath to do that,\u201d she said, after Nawaz repeatedly pressed her on whether she regretted signing the memo that greenlighted removing children from their parents at the Mexican border.\n\nNielsen insisted that she \u201cspoke truth to power from the very beginning\u201d of her tenure, and resigned when it became clear that \u201csaying no\u201d wasn\u2019t enough. But then when Nawaz pointed out that Nielsen had just accepted another position with the administration, on the National Infrastructure Advisory Council, Nielsen defended the move: \u201cAre you telling every CEO in here that they should never advise the government?\u201d she asked incredulously.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNielsen\u2019s interview was over within 15 minutes, and then an event moderator appeared onstage and solemnly addressed the audience: \u201cI know that was intense, and I just want to acknowledge that.\u201d\n\nAnd then I left the auditorium to get a mango-citrus juice and a perfume spritz and think about Powerful Women.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Nielsen is powerful; even before joining Homeland Security, she\u2019d been one of the highest-ranking women in the White House. There\u2019s no doubt that she\u2019s a woman; in public appearances she plays up a traditionally womanly appearance with makeup and high heels.\n\nThose were the basic qualifications for an invitation \u2014 but should they have been the only ones? When we talk about \u201cPowerful Women,\u201d should we applaud a woman who used her considerable power to make life difficult for the most powerless among us?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFortune had titled Nielsen\u2019s session \u201cHard Questions,\u201d and the questions were appropriately pointed: Nobody tossed her softballs about how she balances work and home life, or how she shoehorns in \u201cme\u201d time. Nobody could have grilled Nielsen harder than Nawaz did, or tried to.\n\nBut her presence was so incongruous to the rest of the event \u2014 an innocuous, if privileged brand of go-get-\u2019em corporate feminism \u2014 that it called into question why we were in that hotel at all.\n\nWhat, in 2019, is the purpose and organizing principle of an event like the Most Powerful Women Summit? Is it like the Hall of Presidents at Disney World \u2014 a non-editorializing showcase of every boldfaced woman Fortune could rustle up to prove that many women are powerful?\n\nAD\n\nAre we saying that Powerful Women are just like powerful men \u2014 some good and some bad? Which is true, of course, but then why do we need a separate event for them?\n\nAD\n\nAre we just saying that women like green juice and Rothy\u2019s?\n\nKirstjen Nielsen deserved to be questioned, hard, for her role in an immensely controversial administration policy. And maybe she accepted this particular engagement, her first since leaving the White House, because she thought she could expect a welcoming audience. One who would embrace her as one of their own because being a lady is rough, am I right? Toward the end of her interview, Nielsen wanly said she thought she was going to be asked more about cybersecurity.\n\nBut still, there was something off about it. Here she was, making her reputation-washing debut in a ballroom event celebrating aspirational women, smiling grittily as she informed us that, no, we\u2019d all misremembered the whole past three years.\n\nAnd most of us had paid $13,500 to be there.\n\nMonica Hesse is a columnist writing about gender and its impact on society.
