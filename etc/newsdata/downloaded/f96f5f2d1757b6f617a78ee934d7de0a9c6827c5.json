Then the music suddenly stopped and a jingle for Mytel, a phone operator part-owned by the military, blared through the speakers while the soldier broke into a dance.\n\nThe gag channelled popular anger about the military's tight grip on large swathes of the economy. When the troupe live-streamed their performances on Facebook, the generals were unable to see the funny side and decided to prosecute them.\n\nThey now face between two and four years in prison for violating vaguely-worded laws against online defamation and inducing military officers \u201cto disregard or fail\u201d in their duties. All seven were denied bail and have been held for months at Yangon\u2019s Insein prison.\n\nControversial tradition\n\nThe young performers remain defiant, and have hung on to the boisterous energy they brought to their shows in April.\n\n\u201cAm I scared? No!\u201d said 24-year-old Su Yadanar Myint, giggling, when asked at a court hearing on Tuesday if she feared a prison sentence. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to be scared of\u2026 we can read books, we get to stay privately just with other political prisoners.\u201d\n\nThe Peacock Generation performances' where they made fun of the military found a ready audience on the streets of Yangon. [d. khin/Peacock Generation Facebook page]\n\nThe proceedings have been complicated, with some members of the group travelling between two different courts to defend against two different charges and others only facing one charge.\n\nFive of the seven will appear in court again on Wednesday to hear a final ruling for one of the charges, which carries a maximum two year sentence. But that will only mean the end of proceedings for two people. The others will not know their fates until next month, when they have to attend more rulings. They face prison sentences of up to four years.\n\nThangyat, performed during Myanmar\u2019s April New Year celebration, traditionally serves as a vehicle for communicating uncomfortable truths to the country\u2019s leaders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tradition that lets the people tell the government and the rulers what is happening in the country, what has to be done and what has to be fixed,\u201d said Zeyar Lwin, 29, another of the defendants.\n\nThe military junta tolerated the performances for a while after taking power in a 1962 coup, but then banned them in 1988; the same year they killed thousands of protestors to stamp out a mass student-led uprising.\n\nThe tradition was permitted again by a reformist military-backed government in 2013, but performers were still compelled to submit their lyrics to censors for approval.\n\nAnd while the government of former dissident and human rights icon Aung San Suu Kyi ended censorship of thangyat lyrics when it came to power in 2016, it reintroduced it the following year.\n\n\u201cWe have to have freedom of expression parallel with rule of law,\u201d Myo Nyunt, a spokesperson for Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy party, told Al Jazeera. \u201cWe have to balance them, nothing can be reached at the edge.\"\n\nForced onto the streets\n\nNow, troupes that refuse to get approval from censors are barred from performing inside venues, which is why Peacock Generation were among those to hold their shows on the streets.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t submit anything to the censorship committee because we want freedom of expression,\u201d said Su Yadanar Myint. \u201cThe censors would have cut lots of the lyrics.\u201d\n\nIt is unlikely the ensemble\u2019s crude critiques of the military\u2019s continued role in politics would have survived the red pen.\n\nThey should grow a thick skin so they can actually listen to what younger people think about them. Thinzar Shunlei Yi, youth activist\n\nAt one point in the show the performers referred to unelected military lawmakers, who are guaranteed 25 percent of all seats in parliament, as \u201c25 cow sh**s in a beautiful garden,'' Su Yadanar Myint said.\n\nAnother lyric demanded that generals be sent to the International Criminal Court, or ICC. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the ones they hated the most,\u201d said Zeyar Lwin.\n\nMyanmar\u2019s military has faced repeated international calls for its generals to be prosecuted for genocide after they ordered attacks against the Rohingya minority in 2017 that are believed to have killed thousands.\n\nUnited Nations experts and several major rights groups have also called for accountability for alleged war crimes against other ethnic minorities, including in Kachin and Shan states.\n\nThe military has vehemently rejected the UN panel\u2019s findings.\n\nBrigadier General Zaw Min Tun, a military spokesperson, told Al Jazeera the Peacock Generation\u2019s performance \u201ccreated misunderstandings between the public and the military.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not really good for the dignity of the military,\u201d he added.\n\nMyanmar was a military dictatorship for more than 40 years, and the armed forces continue to wield significant power. [Ann Wang/Reuters]\n\nYoung speak out\n\nThinzar Shunlei Yi, a prominent youth activist, encouraged Myanmar\u2019s generals to embrace the thangyat tradition.\n\n\u201cThey should grow a thick skin so they can actually listen to what younger people think about them,\u201d she said.\n\nMore established and older performers often steer clear of controversial material, she added, meaning it is often only political activists used to the threat of jail who are willing to perform hard-hitting satire.\n\n\u201cIn Myanmar there are many things that our renowned artists and comedians don\u2019t really talk about. It\u2019s only young activists who speak up,\u201d she said.\n\nPart of the reason the Peacock Generation performers are able to stay so upbeat is that some of them have been jailed before for their activism, so they know how to look out for each other, said Zeyar Lwin, who spent nine months in jail in 2015.\n\nThey have also protested for better conditions, including the right to meet their families after court hearings and to be allowed a short break from their handcuffs before being sent back to prison.\n\nEven so, Su Yadanar Myint says that when she gets out she plans to tone down the lyrics to her performances to avoid being arrested again.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to sing more beautifully, less directly,\u201d she said. \u201cNot just \u2018go to the ICC\u2019 or stuff like that.\u201d", "description": "Members of the Peacock Generation were detained after they poked fun at the military in popular street performances.", "authors": ["Joshua Carroll", "Cape Diamond"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/30/3d792504342b4280ae3df8ff036a7c03_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
