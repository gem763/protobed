Its net operating income fell 69 percent from 2015 to 2017; a Trump Organization representative testified last year that the reason was Trump\u2019s damaged brand.\n\nAD\n\nNow, the G-7 summit will draw hundreds of diplomats, journalists and security personnel to the resort during one of its slowest months of the year, when Miami is hot and the hotel is often less than 40 percent full. It will also provide a worldwide spotlight for the club.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat about Doral?\u201d Trump asked aides earlier this year, according to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who announced the move. Mulvaney said a nationwide search conducted by Trump\u2019s administration led to the conclusion that the president was right.\n\n\u201cDoral was far and away the best physical facility for this meeting,\u201d he said. The administration examined 10 sites before choosing this one, according to Mulvaney, who then quoted an anonymous site selection official who he said told him, \u201cIt\u2019s almost like they built this facility to host this type of event.\u201d Mulvaney did not say what other sites were vetted \u2014 just that they were all worse.\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to select his own resort as host of the international gathering is a sign that he is becoming more brazen about flouting criticism from Congress and shattering ethical norms that have been observed by previous presidents with regard to separating the duties of their office from their financial well-being.\n\nAD\n\nIt also appears to signal the collapse of promises made by the president and Eric Trump, his son and the day-to-day leader of Trump\u2019s businesses, at the start of the Trump presidency \u2014 when they pledged to create separation between the president\u2019s private business and his new public office.\n\n\u201cI will be leaving my great business in total,\u201d Trump said as president-elect in 2016.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere are lines that we would never cross, and that\u2019s mixing business with anything government,\u201d Eric Trump said in 2017.\n\nThe Trump Organization on Thursday said it was \u201chonored\u201d to have been chosen by its owner, the president, for this event.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to have been asked to host the 2020 G-7 Summit at Trump National Doral,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nBut the company did not respond to questions about how much money it will make off this event.\n\nAD\n\nEric Trump did not respond to questions about how much the president\u2019s company would charge the United States or foreign governments during the event. He also did not respond to questions about whether the Trump Organization would ask taxpayers to pay for upgrades to the site. One obvious concern for next year: There will be at least eight world leaders coming to this event, but at present Doral has just two \u201cpresidential suites.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe State Department, which typically helps organize these events, declined to comment.\n\nMulvaney said the White House was not going to release information about the selection process.\n\n\u201cIf you want to see our paper on how we did this, the answer is absolutely not,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, the Democratic-led House has already passed a measure that would ban federal funds from being paid to the president\u2019s properties \u2014 a provision that, if it became law, would seem to block a gigantic federal event at the Doral Club.\n\nAD\n\nRep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.), one of 200 congressional Democrats who have sued Trump over his doing business with foreign governments and are investigating Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel, said that president\u2019s ongoing interest was to \u201cleverage the presidency to benefit himself, his family and his associates, rather than the country\u2019s interests.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), a member of the House Judiciary Committee, also condemned the decision. \u201cThe cardinal sin of the Trump presidency is the conversion of his public office into an instrument of private gain and campaign activity,\u201d he said, calling the deal a \u201csellout of the U.S. government, the Constitution and the American people.\u201d\n\nHosting the G-7 summit could become problematic legally for Trump because foreign governments would be paying money to his business, which Democrats have held is a violation of the foreign emoluments clause of the Constitution.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s decision confirms what we have long known: Unless the courts expeditiously require the President to comply with the words of America\u2019s founders, the Foreign Emoluments Clause soon will lose all practical effect, allowing presidents to profit from foreign governments without first obtaining the consent of Congress,\u201d Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center and one of the lead attorneys for the congressional Democrats on the case, said in a statement.\n\nAD\n\nOther Democrats on Capitol Hill were bothered that the White House made the Doral announcement on the day that Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), chair of the House Oversight Committee and one of the most aggressive investigators of Trump\u2019s conduct, died.\n\n\u201cGod bless Elijah E. Cummings \u2014 this is what Chairman Cummings talked about all the time,\u201d said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.). \u201cAnd it\u2019s just, you know, on the same day as Chairman Cummings passes, for the administration to do what it did is just a reminder of how important oversight is and how we need a vital check on the executive branch.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe G-7 summit rotates among sites chosen by the seven member countries and by the European Union. The last time it took place in the United States, in 2012, President Barack Obama held it at the government-owned retreat at Camp David in Maryland. Before that, President George W. Bush held it at the exclusive, isolated resort of Sea Island, Ga., in 2004.\n\nAD\n\nThis year, Trump had hinted repeatedly that he intended to award the event to himself. At this year\u2019s G-7 summit, in August in Biarritz, France, Trump said his aides had examined other sites and come back to tell him that Doral was the best.\n\n\u201cThey went to places all over the country, and they came back and they said, \u2018This is where we\u2019d like to be,\u2019 \u201d Trump said then. \u201cIt\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about getting the right location.\u201d He particularly praised the club\u2019s ample parking.\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s properties have hosted U.S. government officials before, and his company says it does not seek to make a profit off that business. But even so, those locales can be expensive. At his Mar-a-Lago Club, for instance, the government paid Trump\u2019s company $546 per night for each staffer staying in the club\u2019s guest rooms and $1,000 for a single night of drinking by White House aides at one of Mar-a-Lago\u2019s bars.\n\nAD\n\nIn this case, Eric Trump recently said that if Doral was the choice, the president would not overcharge his own government.\n\n\u201cIt actually would have saved the U.S. a tremendous amount of money in that they wouldn\u2019t be paying for massive amounts of rooms with some hospitality company that\u2019s going to milk the hell out of the U.S. government,\u201d Eric Trump said at a forum put on by Yahoo Finance last week.\n\nAD\n\nThese events are massive: In 2004, when the United States hosted the summit on Sea Island, the organizers served 45,000 meals to 3,000 people and paid the owners of the Island resort $3 million to reserve the entire property for 10 days, according to Bob Goodwin, who organized the event for Bush. He said that foreign governments also paid for their own rooms.\n\nGoodwin said that the organizers paid for communications upgrades to the island but not for any upgrades to the resort itself.\n\nGovernment contracting experts were deeply skeptical that the president would not benefit financially from the deal.\n\n\u201cAny great resort in the country would love to be on national television nonstop hosting the G-7,\u201d said Steven Schooner, professor of government procurement law at George Washington University.\n\nSchooner, who has advised plaintiffs who have sued Trump over his business practices, said that owners of competing properties could potentially file a complaint opposing the decision, given the lack of transparency in the selection process. \u201cWe know what an open and competitive contracting process looks like, and that\u2019s what this wasn\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n\nEven if the Trump Organization charged lower than market rates, the event would bring guests to fill unfilled rooms, as well as a glut of global publicity.\n\nThe summit will also come to Doral at a particularly good time \u2014 June, when Miami is steamy and its business usually drops off sharply. In 2017, the hotel reported that June was its second-slowest month, with just 38.3 percent of its rooms occupied. Only August, at 31.1 percent, was slower.\n\nDoral Mayor J.C. Bermudez said late Thursday that he had not been told of the resort\u2019s selection. \u201cI found out the same way that I guess you did,\u201d by watching Mulvaney\u2019s news conference, he said.\n\nAt day\u2019s end, Bermudez said he was unaware of any calls from the federal government to the city, even after Mulvaney\u2019s announcement. He said he was eager to start the planning for the massive event eight months away.\n\nTrump has visited his own properties more than 100 times as president \u2014 sometimes bringing along foreign leaders. Those visits have resulted in tens of thousands of dollars in revenue for his businesses, as the U.S. government \u2014 and other governments \u2014 pay for their personnel to accompany him.\n\nBut this is something on a different scale: Seven foreign leaders, plus hundreds of other foreign personnel, would be housed at Trump\u2019s resort. Trump is already facing lawsuits for allegedly violating the Constitution\u2019s ban on receiving \u201cemoluments\u201d from foreign governments.\n\nTrump bought the 57 year-old Doral golf resort in 2012, taking out $125 million in loans from Deutsche Bank to finance the purchase. He then poured money into renovating it \u2014 relying heavily on a crew of Hispanic stoneworkers that included some undocumented immigrants, according to members of the crew.\n\nThe Doral club is a keystone property in Trump\u2019s portfolio. It provides him more revenue than any other hotel or golf club. Since 2015, however, the 643-room club\u2019s revenue and profits have nose-dived, according to figures that the Trump Organization provided to Miami-Dade County last year.\n\n\u201cThey are severely underperforming\u201d other resorts in the area, tax consultant Jessica Vachiratevanurak, who had been hired by Trump, told a county official last year in a bid to lower the property\u2019s tax bill. Vachiratevanurak said the club\u2019s net operating income \u2014 a key figure, representing the amount left over after expenses are paid \u2014 had fallen by 69 percent as of 2017.\n\nThe Trump Organization says the real problems scaring visitors away are the Zika virus and hurricanes. The Doral club\u2019s revenue rebounded slightly in 2018, according to Trump\u2019s presidential financial disclosures, though it is unclear whether profits went up or down.\n\nIn recent years, Doral has turned to Trump\u2019s political allies to replace some of its lost revenue. This past weekend, for instance, it hosted a pro-Trump group called American Priority. Shown at that event was a violent video depicting Trump shooting, stabbing and beheading members of the media and some Democratic opponents, according to the New York Times.", "description": "The decision is without precedent in modern American history: The president used his public office to direct a huge contract to himself.", "authors": ["Toluse Olorunnipa", "White House Reporter", "David A.
