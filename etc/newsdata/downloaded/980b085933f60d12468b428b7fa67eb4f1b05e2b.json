Construction of buildings with two or more units rose 32.8% in August from a month earlier. Single-family home construction, meanwhile, rose just 4.4%\n\nResidential building permits, which can signal how much construction is in the pipeline, rose 7.7% from July to an annual pace of 1.419 million.\n\nHousing-starts data are volatile from month to month and can be subject to large revisions. August\u2019s 12.3% increase for starts came with a margin of error of 10.2 percentage points. More broadly, home construction has been weak this year. In the first eight months of 2019, starts were down 1.8% compared with the same period in 2018.\n\nWednesday\u2019s data are a positive sign for a housing sector that has been on shaky footing the past year. Despite historically low mortgage rates and rising wages, the housing sector has been strained by a low inventory of affordable homes, propelled by rising construction costs and lack of land.\n\nLast month, the Commerce Department reported that July saw the largest monthly drop in new-homes sales since 2013, with new-home sales falling by 12.8 percent, a bigger decline than economists had anticipated. Numbers for August 2019 will be released on Sept. 25.\n\nEconomists have been waiting for low mortgage rates to have a measurable impact on the housing market. The average interest rate on a 30-year mortgage was 3.56% last week, according to Freddie Mac, about a percentage point less than it was a year ago. A Wednesday report from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed that mortgage applications for home purchases have risen for three straight weeks.\n\nHome-builder stocks, meanwhile, are outpacing the S&P 500 this year by a 13-point margin, fueled in part by speculation over low borrowing costs.\n\nZillow economist Matthew Speakman said the strong August housing-starts numbers indicated high builder confidence was being buoyed by falling mortgage rates. \u201cIt\u2019s not flashy, but this sign of resilience is welcome news for a housing market that is still struggling to grasp some momentum,\u201d Mr. Speakman said.", "description": "Home building in the U.S. increased in August to the highest level since June 2007, a positive note for the housing industry in a year marked by lagging home sales and sluggish single-family construction.", "authors": ["Will Parker", "Sarah Chaney", "Sarah.Chaney Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108251/social", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
