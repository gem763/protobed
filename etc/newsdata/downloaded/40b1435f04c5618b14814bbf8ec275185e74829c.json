John Durham, the U.S. attorney for Connecticut, is leading that effort. The Justice Department\u2019s Office of the Inspector General has also been conducting an investigation into aspects of the FBI's Russia probe. That report is expected to be released in the near future.\n\nSenate Democrats on the Judiciary Committee also sent a letter to Barr on Thursday that questioned the attorney general's ability to be impartial in any matter related to Trump and Ukraine. In their letter, the senators cited Trump's July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, in which he asked Zelensky to investigate the Biden family. During that call, Trump said that both Barr and his personal attorney Rudy Giuiliani would get in touch with the Ukrainian president.\n\n\"This raises legitimate questions about your knowledge of the activities of Mr. Giuliani and others, as well as the actions that you have taken and your discussions with the President and White House about these investigations,\" the senators wrote.\n\nThe Democratic senators also cited Barr's visit to Italy to look into the origins of the Russia investigation, and noted that Trump told Zelensky he would \"like to have the Attorney General call\" to discuss a conspiracy theory related to Ukraine and the 2016 election.\n\n\"Impartial enforcement of the law is essential to give the American public confidence in the Justice Department's work,\" the senators wrote. \"Your personal connection to these matters creates the appearance of a conflict of interest and gives rise to questions about whether the Department is being used to advance the President's personal interests.\"\n\nBut Republicans defended the Justice Department\u2019s decision to classify its review as a criminal investigation. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) further predicted on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo\u201d that the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general report would be damning. He also touted his resolution, introduced Thursday, that condemns the House impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cFifty Republicans have told the Nancy Pelosi House Democrats that what you're doing to the president is unfair,\u201d Graham said, citing the number of co-sponsors to his resolution.\n\nSchiff was unfazed by Graham\u2018s resolution. He instead touted a Friday court decision in which a federal judge ruled that the Justice Department needed to turn over former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s grand jury evidence to the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe decision came after House Democrats secured damning testimony last week from William Taylor, the United States\u2019 top diplomat in Ukraine, who told investigators that Trump wanted to make military aid and a White House meeting with the Ukrainian president conditional upon a Ukrainian government investigation into his political rivals.\n\n\u201cI think what we\u2019re seeing really is Lindsey Graham trying to respond to the devastating testimony that\u2019s come out from Ambassador Taylor and others,\u201d Schiff said on \u201cThis Week.\"\n\nSchiff said the House Intelligence Committee would continue moving forward, and described former national security adviser John Bolton as \u201can important witness.\u201d He reiterated that the House would have public hearings but declined to say when.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to give precise timing because ,in part, we\u2019re struggling with the White House\u2019s continuing efforts to obstruct our investigation, to obstruct witnesses coming in,\u201d Schiff said.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f6/39/cf91b20947ca8221d5cbd333a19d/20191027-schiff-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
