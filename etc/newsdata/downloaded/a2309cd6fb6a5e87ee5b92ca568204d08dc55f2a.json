Mike Parson announced he\u2019s sending additional law enforcement officers to St. Louis.\n\nOn Oct. 1, Parson will send 25 state employees, mostly state troopers, to the city. So far this year, at least 22 children have been shot in gun-related incidents across the St. Louis metropolitan area.\n\n(MORE: Gun deaths of St. Louis children rise to 22 as 3-year-old shoots self in head)\n\nLast week a 3-year-old boy in the city accidentally shot himself in the head and a 13-year-old boy was shot while walking through an apartment complex on the same day.\n\n\u201cWe know we have a serious problem with violent crime that must be addressed, and we have spent the past months meeting with leaders and organizations at all levels to discuss possible solutions,\u201d Parson said in a statement Thursday. \u201cThis is about targeting violent criminals and getting them off our streets. If we are to change violent criminal acts across our state, we must work together, we must do our jobs, we must support our law enforcement officers to accomplish these goals, and we must start prioritizing the prevention of crime.\u201d\n\nPHOTO: Missouri Gov.

This move, he said, will free up local officers to focus on known \u201chigh-crime\u201d areas.\n\n\u201cLaw enforcement has the greatest impact on taking violent criminals off the highways when we work collaboratively at all levels of government throughout the criminal justice system,\u201d Missouri State Highway Patrol Colonel Eric Olson said in a statement. \u201cThe Patrol is committed to this plan and working with our partners and citizens to help make the region safer.\u201d\n\n(MORE: 'This is urgent': Mayor announces reward in string of fatal child shootings)\n\nParson is also allocating $2 million in state resources to help crime victims.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to doing everything we can at the state level, but we can\u2019t do it alone. It is truly a team effort, and everyone has to do their job to keep Missourians safe,\u201d Parson said. \u201cNone of us, no matter where we\u2019re from, want to see our children being shot in the streets. If we are to change violent criminal acts across our state, we must do our jobs, work together, and support our law enforcement officers to accomplish that goal.\u201d\n\nWhile gun-related violence is up across the Show-Me state, including Kansas City, Parson is not sending troopers or additional funding to those areas at this time, according to The Associated Press.\n\nSt. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson and the St. Louis Police Department did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.", "description": "To help combat a wave of violence and the recent rise in shooting incidents involving children, Missouri Gov.
