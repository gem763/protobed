In others, the injuries that US veterans suffered are hidden from view.\n\nBut all of the works by former president George W. Bush \u2014 painted as a tribute to the men and women he sent to war \u2014 reflect the human toll of his decisions as commander-in-chief.\n\nCommand Sergeant Major Brian Flom was wounded in the face by a rocket attack in Iraq in 2007.\n\n\u201cThat was the easy part,\u201d he told AFP, standing beside a painting in which he appears with fellow military personnel, one of dozens of works on display at Washington\u2019s Kennedy Center.\n\n\u201cThe challenging part was the TBI (traumatic brain injury) and the post-traumatic stress that accompanied a lot of time spent in a combat zone.\u201d\n\nRecovery is \u201cstill going on \u2014 it\u2019s an everyday process, right, and some days are better than others.\u201d\n\nFlom was selected to go on a mountain bike ride with Bush in 2015, and has now met him \u201cmany times,\u201d including dinner at the former president\u2019s house.\n\nBush \u201cdecided one day to paint people that he had a connection with and meant something to him, and here I am.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge honor,\u201d Flom said.\n\nBush ordered the American military into Afghanistan following the September 11, 2001 attacks and launched the invasion of Iraq to topple dictator Saddam Hussein in 2003.\n\nMore than 3,500 American military personnel have been killed and more than 32,000 wounded in hostile action in Iraq, while combat in Afghanistan \u2014 a war that turned 18 on Monday \u2014 has left nearly 2,000 dead and more than 20,500 wounded.\n\nBush took up painting after leaving office in early 2009, and has sought to help veterans who served in the wars that defined his presidency.\n\n\u201cI painted these men and women as a way to honor their service to the country and to show my respect for their sacrifice and courage,\u201d Bush said in a quote featured at the exhibition, which is titled \u201cPortraits of Courage: A Commander in Chief\u2019s Tribute to America\u2019s Warriors.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Wish it was different\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cEverybody that was painted\u2026 has participated in one of two events that the president hosts every year with wounded veterans and their families\u201d \u2014 a bike ride and a golf tournament \u2014 said former US Army sergeant first class Michael Rodriguez.\n\nRodriguez, who is pictured in a standalone portrait by Bush, deployed nine times during his 21 years in the military and was wounded several times, \u201cmainly traumatic brain injuries\u201d from bomb blasts.\n\nHe met Bush during a mountain bike ride in 2014, and was later selected for an advisory council on how to better serve post-9/11 veterans and their families, getting to know him personally.\n\nRodriguez said he has no anger toward Bush over the injuries he sustained.\n\n\u201cDuring my 21 years of service, I worked for four different presidents. I would never assume to\u2026 be that arrogant to think I\u2026 had all the information to make the decisions they made,\u201d he said.\n\nHe has \u201cnever, ever been upset at any of our presidents.\u201d\n\nFormer US army sergeant DeWitt Osborne is another veteran painted by Bush, like Flom appearing in a montage of military personnel.\n\nHe was wounded by a bomb blast near Baghdad in 2006 that injured his right shoulder, right foot, fractured vertebrae and caused traumatic brain injury as well as post-traumatic stress.\n\nHe underwent 21 surgeries, spending four years recovering at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.\n\nOsborne said he still follows events in Iraq, where the US withdrawal was followed by a rise in violence, a jihadist takeover of swathes of the country and years of battles to push the militants back.\n\nProtests have recently erupted in which more than 100 people have been killed over a week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame,\u201d Osborne said of events there, expressing hope that things get better. \u201cWe as a country (have) shed a lot of blood and tears and work over there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish it was different.\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 In some paintings, the wounds are plain to see: an arm or leg lost to war.
