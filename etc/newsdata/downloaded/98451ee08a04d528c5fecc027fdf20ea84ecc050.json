Gavin Newsom announced he had signed a bill that could fundamentally change college sports. The Fair Pay to Play Act will allow college athletes in the state to earn money by signing endorsement deals. Under current NCAA rules, these actions would cost players their amateur status and cause them to be barred from college competition.\n\nThe bill has received high-profile support: NBA superstar LeBron James said it would allow star athletes to be compensated for \u201cthe billions they create,\u201d and Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders tweeted, \u201cCollege athletes are workers. Pay them.\u201d\n\nNCAA president Mark Emmert warned that California schools could be barred from competing for national championships if the bill goes into effect. The issue of endorsements is related to, but distinct from, the debate over whether universities should directly pay athletes a stipend for playing.\n\nWhy there's debate:\n\nSupporters of the bill argue that star athletes generate a tremendous amount of money for the people and systems around them but don't see any profit themselves, all while risking injury that could jeopardize their future earning potential. The situation is especially pernicious, some argue, because players in profitable \"revenue sports\" like football and basketball are forbidden from playing professionally out of high school because of age restrictions in the NBA and NFL.\n\nEndorsement money could help alleviate the difficult financial circumstances that many players face while in college and benefit athletes in sports that don't have high-paying professional leagues, proponents say.\n\nOpponents of the bill say it would undermine the spirit of amateurism that has been a core element of collegiate sports. There is also concern that allowing a handful of star players to earn big money would perpetuate a competitive imbalance that unfairly benefits high-profile schools. Others make the case that players are paid in the form of scholarship money and earn indirect benefit from the publicity that comes from playing college sports.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nThe Fair Pay to Play Act will go into effect on Jan. 1, 2023. However, by that point it may prove unnecessary. The NCAA has begun its own process to look into how its rules might be amended to potentially allow many of the same provisions as California\u2019s bill.\n\nPerspectives\n\nCalifornia's bill could force a radical change in how college sports work\n\n\"California can indeed change the game by passing the bill, which would circumvent the NCAA\u2019s unfair and draconian rules forbidding student-athletes from making money\n\nEndorsements can be beneficial to players and schools\" \u2014 Liz Roscher, Yahoo Sports\n\nEndorsements can be beneficial to players and schools\n\n\"Letting other people pay the athletes is a win-win-win. Players get a fair deal, and colleges avoid cash outlays many can\u2019t make, issues over fairness among athletes, and unseemly bidding wars.\" \u2014 Len Simon, San Francisco Chronicle\n\nDirect athlete endorsements would undermine more equitable schoolwide deals\n\n\"Currently, corporate funds go to athletic departments and are generally distributed among all sports; with third-party payments, those funds could instead mostly go directly to a few student-athletes, starving the rest.\" \u2014 Cody McDavid, New York Times\n\nAthletes are left out of the huge money created by college sports\n\n\"Truly, the NCAA presides over a system that generates huge payouts for many participants. \u2026 Who\u2019s deprived of a piece of the action? The student-athletes, who put their health and lives on the line to feed everyone else at the trough.\" \u2014 Michael Hiltzik, Los Angeles Times\n\nAthletes are already paid in scholarships\n\n\"I have never seen an athlete under scholarship starve while attending an American university. These kids are not living in poverty. If you\u2019re on scholarship, you\u2019re getting paid a lot of money \u2014 scholarship money.\" \u2014 Nick Canepa, San Diego Union-Tribune\n\nOutside money would solve the funding problems that come with paying players directly\n\n\"So how do you create greater efficiencies (i.e., paying higher amounts to the athletes or teams generating more revenue) without creating internal budgeting or gender equity issues within your athletics program? You source those funds externally.\" \u2014 Patrick Rishe, Forbes", "description": "The question of whether college athletes should be paid got a new wrinkle thanks to a bill in California that would allow player to sign endorsement deals, in violation of NCAA rules.
