It pledged to resume them after its cash position improves.\n\nCEO Rajeev Suri said that risks previously flagged regarding the initial phase of the rollout of the high speed 5G networks are \u201cnow materializing\u201d for Nokia. He said there was \u201cpricing pressure\u201d in closing initial 5G deals, reflecting operators\u2019 reluctance to pay premium prices for the new network technology that allows ultra-fast downloading speeds.\n\n\u201cWe expect that we will be able to progressively mitigate these issues over the course of next year,\u201d Suri said in a statement. \u201cTo do so, we will increase investment in 5G in order to accelerate product roadmaps and product cost reductions, and in the digitalization of internal processes to improve overall productivity.\u201d\n\nNokia said it has 48 commercial 5G deals and 15 live networks, roughly on par with Swedish competitor Ericsson but clearly lower than Chinese market leader Huawei, which has however been shadowed by allegations of spying and security concerns.\n\nNokia didn\u2019t comment on Huawei\u2019s current woes but noted that \u201csome customers are reassessing their vendors in light of security concerns, creating near-term pressure (for Nokia) to invest in order to secure long-term benefits.\u201d\n\nHuawei, the world\u2019s biggest maker of telecom network gear, has been at the center of a furious geopolitical battle between the U.S. and China. The U.S. government has been lobbying allies in Europe and elsewhere to shun Huawei over concerns its equipment might aid Chinese electronic spying, claims that the company has consistently denied.\n\nEarlier this month, the European Union warned that 5G networks face a range of cyber threats, including from hostile countries.\n\nWhile steering clear of singling out Huawei, an EU security risk assessment identified \u201cstates or state-backed actors\u201d as the most serious and likely culprits to carry out sophisticated attacks on new 5G networks.\n\nThe report didn\u2019t name specific countries. It only briefly mentioned Huawei as one of the main suppliers of 5G equipment, alongside with Nokia and Ericsson - the three main companies that dominate the network business.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Finnish tech company Nokia warned Thursday that its profits will be lower than expected due to tough competition and costs related to new-generation 5G networks, about which mobile operators are cautious amid global concerns about cybersecurity.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jari Tanner"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
