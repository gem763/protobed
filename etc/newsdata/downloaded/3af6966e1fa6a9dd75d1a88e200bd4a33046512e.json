The game doesn\u2019t use a camera. We added the picture-in-picture to illustrate how it works.\n\nNintendo\u2019s newest Switch game, Ring Fit Adventure, is an amusing generator of unusual, unprecedented experiences. Never before have I lost a 20-minute video game boss battle because my form could have been better in one or two yoga stretches. Never before have I opened an in-game treasure chest by doing squats. Never before have I found anything \u2014 not a playlist, not a personal trainer, not a disappointed glance in the mirror \u2014 that has made me actually look forward to exercising my core. That last one alone designates Ring Fit Adventure as genius software.\n\nRing Fit Adventure is a hybrid of a workout routine and a stat- and story-driven video game in which you attack your enemies with exercise. You team up with a talking ring to save the world from evil monsters, some of which are shaped like dumbbells, and you\u2019re going to sweat, at least a little, to save the day.\n\nThe surprisingly enjoyable Nintendo creation is no gym replacement, but it\u2019s a fascinating experiment that will likely impact users differently depending on their level of fitness. It\u2019s more of a traditional video game than Nintendo\u2019s blockbuster 2008 exercise game Wii Fit. There\u2019s a world map! There\u2019s levelling up! There\u2019s a story! It\u2019s smartly designed with trademark Nintendo ingenuity, while still limited in the way even the best-intentioned home exercise offerings tend to be.\n\nThe game is packaged with two key items: a frozen-pizza-sized plastic tension ring into which the player snaps the system\u2019s right Joy-Con controller and a leg strap into which the player slips the left one. The ring can be squeezed and stretched, as the controller\u2019s sensor tracks tension and tilt.\n\nThat enables the game to challenge you to squeeze the ring overhead to work your deltoids, for example, and to detect if you\u2019ve squeezed, how hard you squeezed, if you\u2019re holding that squeeze and how fast you\u2019re releasing it. The sensors can keep track of your hands during a squat or the tilt of your body as you do a yoga pose while holding the ring. The sensor in the Joy-Con on your leg tracks tilt, which can detect the depth of a squat or your pace as you run in place. It can also track the angle of your thigh and therefore some of the quality of your form as you lay on the floor, ring set aside, doing leg lifts.\n\nThe sensors are limited in what they can detect and the exercises they can orchestrate, which makes the game as prone to cheating as any other exercise gear unaccompanied by a well-compensated personal trainer. The game does try to simulate one, at least with animated experts demonstrating good technique and a lot of voicework urging the same. The game\u2019s verbal prompting, not the Joy-Cons\u2019 sensors, is what\u2019ll keep your back straight or your shoulders down or your knees bent as you attempt good form in a given exercise.\n\nMore significantly, the game\u2019s structure \u2014 its video-gameness, for lack of a better way of putting it \u2014 is its prime motivational tool. Workouts are integrated into a lengthy adventure, which is broken into levels that each involve about a dozen minutes of exercise.\n\nPlaying those levels involves a mix of running in place, which makes your in-game character run through an obstacle course or outdoor pathway toward a goal, squeezing the ring to shoot bursts of air at destructible boxes and pulling it outward to vacuum coins. (You can switch to a quiet mode that replaces running with knee bends, if you have downstairs neighbours who are sensitive to noise.)\n\nRing Fit Adventure comes with a leg strap and a tension ring which combine with the Switch\u2019s Joy-Con controllers to track the user\u2019s workout movements.\n\nAs you jog through a level, you encounter enemies who pull you into turn-based battles in which you choose specific exercises to use for attacks, drink attack-boosting or health-buffing smoothie power-ups to keep yourself alive and accrue experience points to level up and unlock new exercises. These battles are the part of the game that provide the most rigorous exercise and are engagingly presented as strategic combat in which you\u2019re picking the right exercises to do the most damage.\n\nProper form helps. If you don\u2019t squat deeply enough or don\u2019t engage your core long enough during a leg lift, you\u2019ll do less damage. This is very much subject to what the sensors can detect and makes the game prone to cheating.\n\nRegardless, clearing a level means narrative progress and the accrual of experience points which will level you up to increase your attack and defence stats.\n\nRing Fit Adventure BACK OF THE BOX QUOTE No pain, no XP gain. TYPE OF GAME Exercise Adventure LIKED Novel idea, takes seconds to set up for a workout, exercise-driven battles actually made me want to work out my core DISLIKED The jogging between battles doesn't accomplish much, the Switch's sensors can't track your form enough to prevent bad habits DEVELOPER Nintendo PLATFORM Switch RELEASE DATE October 18 PLAYED Did nine workouts in 11 days for a total of 98 minutes of exercise time, 432.75 calories burned (estimated), did 318 squats\n\nThe more you play, the more you unlock new exercises and strategic possibilities. The game is actually motivating its player to target certain muscle groups from workout to workout, but it so effectively works this into the mental process of strategic turn-based combat that I was barely conscious of that as I played.\n\nFor example, I\u2019m not a person who normally wants to do stomach exercises, but then I played deep enough into Ring Fit Adventure to unlock the ability to target colour-coded enemies with colour-coded attacks. Suddenly I was looking forward to clearing out yellow enemies with some solid core work. I was eager to get on the floor and do some leg lifts, because I knew they\u2019d do added damage. I wanted to exploit weaknesses and clear the fight.\n\nThe middle guy is weak to yoga. His buddies take extra damage if you do ab exercises.\n\nIn tougher battles, I\u2019ve been motivated to pick exercises that don\u2019t just target colour-coded weaknesses but focus on one enemy or target a group. I\u2019ve also started to use boosts, which can give, say, leg-based exercises more potency for a few turns.\n\nTo really get into Ring Fit Adventure, you don\u2019t just need the game, though. You also need the power to not care how ridiculous you will look playing this game. After all, you play a lot of this game by running in place while squeezing a plastic ring. This is not something that will make you look cool.\n\nPlay it alone or with understanding spectators and you\u2019re fine. Will you get buff? I\u2019m not sure how effective the workouts in the game can be, if they can significantly sculpt your body rather than simply motivate you to enjoy feeling some burn and getting active each day. I\u2019ve played the game for 10 days, raising the game\u2019s workout difficulty a couple of notches a few days ago.\n\nI\u2019ve played more to proceed through the game world than to really knock myself out, and so I\u2019ve generally gotten a light sweat and a little muscle burn from each workout, but, other than when we shot some clips of me playing under hot studio lights, nothing really wiped me out. The moments in each workout when I would run in place to propel my character through a level elevated my pulse a little, but they provided little more labour than a brisk walk. The exercise combat was where I\u2019d find any burn.\n\nA person\u2019s fitness level will play a big factor in this. I\u2019ve got a small paunch of a belly and I don\u2019t lift weights, but I do run three times a week, about 40 minutes per run. A couple of minutes of cardio in this game is a breeze for me, but I could certainly use more work on my core, which I\u2019m at least grateful for the game to motivate me to do. It\u2019s one reason I plan to play more and could be one of many fitness goals that Ring Fit could help a player pursue.\n\nThese were all the exercises I did in a failed attempt to beat one of the game\u2019s world bosses. He had a sliver of health remaining.\n\nThe other reason I plan to keep playing Ring Fit Adventure is because I\u2019m a sucker for novel game design. This thing is like no game I\u2019ve experienced before, and I badly want to see how it plays out. What happens when Nintendo\u2019s designers marry exercise to action-adventure video game mechanics? Where does a game like this go?\n\nThe game starts with a silly narrative set-up. You\u2019re a man or woman who finds a talking ring. You\u2019 team up with it to, at least initially, fight a buff dragon who is terrorising the world. The ring acts mostly as a personal trainer, motivating you through your exercises and making this the most voice-acted game Nintendo has ever put out, for better or worse. Sample line: \u201cYour sweat is so shiny and beautiful!\u201d Uh, thanks, game.\n\nAs you work out, you\u2019re working your way through an in-game map that even includes a town with a shop that sells new outfits and smoothie-based power-ups. Each level has a little story behind it. You\u2019re rescuing a character or helping them find something or fighting the big dragon again.\n\nThe one town I\u2019ve found so far is very basic. There\u2019s a shop staffed by side characters who are selling smoothies and stat-altering outfits. After I cleared one level, I unlocked a new power for my ring and can now combine ingredients I discover into new smoothies.\n\nI want to see more and more of this kind of thing, but I can\u2019t rush it. You can\u2019t binge-play a game like this, not without passing out or cheating at the exercises. I\u2019m happier to just play it naturally and marvel at what the game might show me next. I\u2019ve been amused, for example, to see how exercises are used to trigger some simple things. My favourite, so far, is opening a treasure chest with a trio of squats.\n\nWhere will the story go? How many other outfits can I unlock? Which power-ups must I collect to help me conquer another boss battle? I want to keep playing to find out. That\u2019s a win for the game and for my health, because it means I want to keep exercising.\n\nThe cleverness of Nintendo\u2019s design extends beyond the main exercise adventure. A \u201cmulti-task\u201d mode tracks squeezes and pulls of the ring while your Nintendo Switch system is in sleep mode, the idea being that you could use the ring for arm workouts while talking to someone on the phone or watching TV. Any exercise you do that way provides a boost the next time you play the game. Nintendo\u2019s designers also utilise the right Joy-Con controller\u2019s infrared sensor to track your pulse after a workout, which, just, wow, that\u2019s really clever, Nintendo.\n\nRing Fit Adventure is no replacement for just going to the gym or taking up swimming or otherwise thoroughly committing to exercise. It is, at least, simple to set up, entertaining to play and therefore easy to keep using. It\u2019s Nintendo being weird, which, for some of us, is a draw unto itself. Maybe this isn\u2019t the game you were hoping Nintendo would make next, but it\u2019s the kind of experiment I\u2019m glad the company sometimes tries. And it\u2019s fun, even, miraculously, when it\u2019s asking me to exercise my abs.", "description": "Nintendo\u2019s newest Switch game, Ring Fit Adventure, is an amusing generator of unusual, unprecedented experiences.
