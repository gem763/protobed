REUTERS/Umit Bektas\n\nHong Kong has been relatively calm for the past week, with only small, often colourful demonstrations, and Sunday\u2019s march will test the strength of the pro-democracy campaign, which has in the past rallied millions on to the streets.\n\nIn rejecting the protesters\u2019 request for a march permit, police said past events had been \u201chijacked by a group of radical protesters\u201d who set fire to buildings, hurled petrol bombs at police, detonated a home-made bomb and wrecked infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWhile we always respect citizens\u2019 rights to assembly and freedom of speech, we are alarmed by this epidemic that radical protesters resort to violence in expressing their opinion,\u201d Acting Chief Superintendent of Police Public Relations Branch, Kong Wing-cheung, said in announcing the rejection.\n\nThousands have defied police in the past and staged mass rallies, often peaceful at the start but becoming violent at night.\n\n\u201cWe will not back down even after the attack on the Civil Human Rights Front convener Jimmy Sham. Our most powerful force is the unity and resistance of this civil society,\u201d said the rights group, calling on the public to rally on Sunday.\n\nProminent rights activist Jimmy Sham was brutally beaten by four men wielding hammers and knives on Wednesday, a move pro-democracy lawmakers said was meant to intimidate protesters and incite violence ahead of Sunday\u2019s planned march.\n\nProtesters on Friday night formed a human chain wearing Jimmy Sham face masks, with a banner reading: \u201cWe are all Jimmy Sham. Je Suis Jimmy Sham.\u201d\n\nThe human chain was planned to stretch a 40 km (25 miles) along the city\u2019s metro, with many people wearing eccentric masks in defiance on a ban on covering faces at public rallies. Wearing a face mask at a public rally carries a maximum penalty of one year in jail.\n\n\u201cI am not worried about being prosecuted because I violate the anti-mask law. I think people won\u2019t be afraid to come out on Sunday,\u201d said Kiki, 29, wearing a pig face mask.\n\nHong Kong has been hit by four months of protests, driven by concerns Beijing is eroding freedoms granted when Britain handed the city back to China in 1997.\n\nChina denies the accusation, blaming foreign nations such as the United States and Britain for inciting the unrest.\n\nRelated Coverage U.S. lawmakers urge Apple to restore HKMap app used in Hong Kong\n\nThe crisis in the Chinese-ruled city is the worst since the handover and poses the biggest popular challenge to China\u2019s President Xi Jinping since he took power. Xi has warned he would crush any attempt to split China.\n\nHONG KONG MAN ACCUSED OF MURDER\n\nRiot police and protesters have fought street battles, with police firing tear gas, rubber bullets and occasionally live rounds against brick and petrol-bomb throwing activists.\n\nTwo people have been shot and wounded by police and thousands injured. Police have arrested more than 2,300 people since June.\n\nMany Hong Kong residents are angry with what they believe is excessive force by police and the introduction of the face mask ban by embattled leader Carrie Lam.\n\nLam has rejected the protesters\u2019 five core demands: universal suffrage, an independent inquiry into police behaviour, amnesty for those charged, stop describing protesters as rioters, and the formal withdrawal of an extradition bill.\n\nThe bill, which would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent to Communist Party-controlled courts for trial, was seen as the latest move to erode those freedoms and sparked the unrest. Lam says the bill is now dead, but it has not been formally withdrawn.\n\nThe case of a young Hong Kong man, Chan Tong-kai, accused of murdering his girlfriend in Taiwan last year before fleeing back to Hong Kong, was held up originally as an example of why an extradition bill was needed.\n\nLam\u2019s office said on Friday Chan had written to her saying he would \u201csurrender himself to Taiwan for his alleged involvement in the homicide case in Taiwan upon prison discharge\u201d.\n\nChan is currently serving a 29-month sentence in Hong Kong for money laundering. It was not immediately clear what had prompted his letter or what plea he planned to make.\n\nHong Kong hub is facing its first recession as a result of the unrest, which has damaged tourism and retail.\n\nProtesters dressed in black ninja-like outfits have torched metro stations and Chinese banks and shops they believe are linked to mainland China. Many businesses have been forced to close.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nChina has banned the bulk shipment to the city of black clothing and other items popularly used by Hong Kong protesters, staff at Chinese courier firms said.\n\nSecretary for Transport and Housing, Frank Chan, said on Friday it would be weeks before the metro operated fully.\n\nPro-democracy candidates will stand in almost all 452 seats in Hong Kong\u2019s upcoming local elections, encouraged by the protests, with the outcome of the November poll a barometer of support for the city\u2019s government.", "description": "Hong Kong pro-democracy campaigners on Friday vowed to stage a major march at the weekend despite police ruling the rally illegal, setting the scene for possibly more unrest in the Chinese-ruled city, battered by months of violent protests.", "authors": ["Jessie Pang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442359528&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H1DR", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
