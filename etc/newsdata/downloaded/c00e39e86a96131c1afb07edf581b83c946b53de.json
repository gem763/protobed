Equalities Minister Liz Truss is understood to want to consider the next steps carefully before taking any action - almost a year after a consultation closed.\n\nLast night, fellow equalities minister Baroness Williams said the reforms were more \"complex\" and \"contentious\" than she first thought, telling attendees: \"Bear with us\".\n\nBut Labour's Dawn Butler said: \"She said it\u2019s contentious. What the f***?\n\n\"Being left handed was contentious once upon a time. Being a working woman was contentious once upon a time. Being gay was contentious once upon a time.\n\n(Image: Dave Benett/Getty Images)\n\n\"Who gives a s***? Just amend the Act already. The act is out of date - we all agree.\n\n\"108,000 people contributed to the consultation - just amend the god damn Act!\u201d\n\nCommons Speaker John Bercow took a thinly veiled swipe at Ms Truss by \"saluting\" her predecessor, who he said \"was always crystal clear and unequivocal in her support for trans rights\u201d.\n\nHe added pointedly: \u201cIt is lamentable that progress is not what people expected it to be. But she [Ms Mordaunt] took the lead and others must now follow.\u201d\n\nAnd Penny Mordaunt - who was sacked from Boris Johnson's Cabinet in the summer reshuffle - had carefully-chosen words for her successor in her own speech.\n\nMs Mordaunt said: \"I would say if you feel after you\u2019ve listened, if you feel after following the evidence, if you feel after empathising that to do the right thing you need to be brave, if you are brave - what you will discover is there was no need to be.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nIt came at a glitzy ceremony which featured another sweary rant by Doctor Who chief Russell T Davies at Boris Johnson and Donald Trump .\n\nThe TV legend said the US was \"an empire of bile and hypocrisy and white bigotry run by a great big gargantuan orange space hopper.\n\n\"And frankly like some sort of continental echo we\u2019ve spawned our own blond b****** here.\n\n\"You might have gathered I\u2019m never going to vote Conservative. There are good conservative ministers - people like Nick Gibb the schools minister. It\u2019s supposed to be a good party.\n\n\"It\u2019s supposed to stand for honour and hard work and self responsibility - it\u2019s the party of our mums and dads for god's sake.\n\n\"It is supposed to be a force for good.\n\n\"What the f*** is happening to them?\n\n(Image: Tom Nicholson/BAFTA/REX)\n\n\"It was said by PinkNews that when Amber Rudd left the cabinet that meant more than 50% of the cabinet were against gay marriage.\n\n\"That\u2019s the world we\u2019re living in now. It stinks. And we must do everything to fight it.\u201d\n\nTaking aim at the event's sponsors he added: \"While I\u2019ve got the microphone, pay your f****** taxes Amazon! Come on!\n\n\"It\u2019s all very well talking about having an LGBT inclusive workforce - not if you don\u2019t let them p***!\u201d\n\nBaroness Williams urged patience with the Gender Recognition Act reforms, which have angered some religious and women's groups.\n\nShe said: What I thought and I\u2019m sure Penny would agree with me here would be quite a simple process actually turned out to be quite a complex one.\n\n\"Not only was it complex it was actually quite contentious.\n\n\"And I wondered at one stage in fact rather than reform were we actually going to go backwards with this.\n\n\"So all I can say is bear with us, I would rather get this right in slower time than get it wrong and rush it. But I remain committed to reform of the GRA.\"", "description": "Labour equalities chief Dawn Butler declared 'who gives a s***?' as John Bercow and Tory ex-equalities minister Penny Mordaunt also urged Boris Johnson's government to act", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Pa", "Getty Images", "Dave Benett Getty Images", "Tom Nicholson Bafta Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20639782.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Brexit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
