Some policy makers, however, are likely to oppose the move, pointing to robust consumer spending that is keeping growth in the U.S. around a solid 2% pace.\n\nWednesday's report, based on anecdotal information collected by the 12 regional Fed banks through August 23, described consumer spending as \u201cmixed,\u201d offering something for both camps in that debate.\n\nAuto sales grew modestly and tourism was generally solid. Overall manufacturing was down slightly while housing sales remained constrained. And transportation activity, which includes trucking, softened, which some districts attributed to \u201cslowing global demand and heightened trade tensions.\u201d\n\nThe Beige Book, as the survey is known, follows the release of weak data on U.S. manufacturing this week. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s purchasing managers index showed factory activity contracted in August for the first time since 2016. The group\u2019s gauge of new orders dropped to a more than seven-year low, while the production index hit the lowest since late 2015.\n\nLittle changed with regard to the labor market or prices. Employment grew at a \u201cmodest pace on par with the previous reporting period,\u201d and staffing agencies \u201cuniversally cited tightness across various labor market segments and skill levels, which continued to constrain growth.\u201d\n\nWith the Fed focused on muted inflation, the report showed that firms see only modest price increases.\n\n\u201cAlthough firms in some districts noted an ability to pass along price increases, manufacturers relayed limited ability to raise prices,\u201d the report said. \u201cDistrict reports on the impact of tariffs on pricing were mixed, with some districts anticipating that the effects would not be felt for a few months.\u201d\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "Fed Says Most Businesses Are Optimistic, Consumer Spending \u2018Mixed\u2019", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic23f595ad55f0fee5e58ec855e696cb1d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
