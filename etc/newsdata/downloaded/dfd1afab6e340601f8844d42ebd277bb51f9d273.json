One concern for BMW is the U.S. threat to raise import tariffs on foreign cars, although President Donald Trump has delayed any decision on that until around late November.\n\nNicolas Peter told CNBC's Annette Weisbach at the Frankfurt Motor Show Monday that his firm was \"best prepared\" to cope with trade tariffs but further measures threatened by Washington would have an impact.\n\n\"If this tension between (the) U.S. and China would further escalate this would have an negative impact on our P+L (profit and loss) but we still have a couple of months time and I definitely hope the politicians would come to a sensible solution,\" he said.\n\nData on Monday revealed that BMW Group's global deliveries rose 4.4% in August when compared to the same month last year. The company's total sales across 2019 to the end of August were 1,617,512 units \u2014 a 1.3% rise on 2018's comparable time scale.", "description": "Nicolas Peter said BMW was well positioned to cope with tariffs but hoped Beijing and Washington could avoid further levies.", "authors": ["David Reid"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/101044134-180937601.jpg?v=1418762303", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
