I bet not, considering how the company axed that idea without ever releasing it to the world. But today, it\u2019s launching a $100 mobile gamepad called the Junglecat yet again \u2014 this time reincarnated as a set of two Nintendo Joy-Con-like gamepads that snap onto either side of your handset.\n\nThe catch is you\u2019ll need to stick your phone in a specific case to make that trick work, and Razer only has cases for four phones to start: the Razer Phone 2, Samsung Galaxy Note 9, and Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus in the US, or swapping out the Note 9 for a Huawei P30 Pro case in the rest of the world.\n\nOtherwise, you\u2019ll be connecting the two pads together with a little bridging bar and using them at a distance from your phone or PC, like this:\n\nWill it come to other phones? \u201cWe will continue to evaluate the needs of interested customers and address them accordingly,\u201d a Razer rep tells The Verge, explaining that the company prioritized phones with large displays and gaming-oriented specs that sold in high volumes for this release.\n\nAlso, while Razer is promising the \u201cinstantaneous response with a reliable, low latency connection to your smartphone,\u201d you should probably know that the connection Razer\u2019s talking about is standard Bluetooth Low Energy. Unlike Nintendo\u2019s Joy-Cons and a handful of other third-party controllers, there\u2019s no physical connection to your handset, and it looks like you may need to charge them individually over USB-C.\n\nAll that said, Razer says they\u2019ll deliver 100+ hours of gaming on a charge, which is quite a bit, and will let you remap buttons and even change the sensitivity on its large, Switch-like joysticks as well as offering native support for many games. If you\u2019re interested, you\u2019ll find the new Junglecat here.\n\nP.S. If you think the industrial design looks a lot like a Gamevice, you\u2019re not alone. I thought so, too, which reminded me to go find out what happened back when Gamevice sued Nintendo over the design of its Joy-Cons. Turns out that case was voluntarily dismissed. So now you know.\n\nRazer also announced its first truly wireless earbuds today.", "description": "Remember when Razer announced a sleek sliding gamepad for your iPhone called the Junglecat?
