In 2020, the company said it expect to sell $5 billion to $10 billion of non-strategic assets to help pay down debt.\n\nMeanwhile, for the third quarter of 2019, AT&T's pay-TV business continued to be in free-fall, crimping revenue and hurting the bottom line. WarnerMedia revenue in the third quarter dropped 4.4% on a tough comparison with Warner Bros.'s stronger theatrical slate in the year-earlier period.\n\nREAD MORE: HBO Max will need a hefty 15 million new subscribers just to break even, according to Wall Street analysts\n\nThe telco said it expects chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson to remain chief executive through at least the end of 2020. In addition, the company said it will add one new director at its next board meeting followed by another director in 2020, among the concessions to assuage Elliott's concerns.\n\n\"The objectives we have outlined today have been central to our plans for many months, even before we closed our acquisition of Time Warner,\" Stephenson said in a statement. \"But, as you would expect, our thinking has also benefited from our engagement with our owners, including Elliott Management. I've found our engagement with Elliott to be constructive and helpful, and I look forward to continuing those conversations.\"\n\nLast month, Elliott Management urged AT&T to refocus on its core business, criticizing its massive deals for Time Warner and DirecTV as inhibiting its financial performance.\n\nIn a statement Monday, Elliott Management's Jesse Cohn and Marc Steinberg commended the AT&T plan, saying the new steps \"will create substantial and enduring shareholder value at one of America's greatest companies\u2026 It is clear to us that AT&T is committed to and accountable for creating shareholder value over the near- and long-term.\"\n\nOverall, AT&T's consolidated revenue for the third quarter was $44.59 billion, below analyst consensus estimates of $45 billion and down 2.5% year over year. Net income dropped 18% to $3.95 billion; that translated into Q3 adjusted earnings per share of 94 cents (vs. consensus analyst estimates of EPS of 93 cents).\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, AT&T dropped a net 1.16 million premium TV video subscribers, including at DirecTV, while its over-the-top AT&T TV Now service dropped 195,000 net customers, for a total net loss of 1.36 million video subs. The company attributed about 225,000 of those losses to programming blackouts. As of the end of the period, AT&T had 21.6 million total video customers, which included 1.1 million AT&T TV Now subscribers \u2014 down 3.6 million from 25.2 million a year earlier.\n\nWarnerMedia Q3 2019 operating revenue was $7.8 billion, down 4.4%, dragged down by a 10.4% decline at Warner Bros. with the company citing \"a more favorable mix of box office releases in the prior comparable period\" (which included \"Aquaman\" and \"A Star Is Born\") as well as lower TV licensing. HBO revenue was up 10.6% to $1.8 billion, and Turner revenue of $3.0 billion was up 0.6%.\n\nWarnerMedia has set an HBO Max media day for Tuesday, Oct. 29, to announce new details of the forthcoming subscription streaming service set to debut next spring, which AT&T is banking to drive future financial growth.\n\nFor 2020-22, AT&T projects consolidated revenue to grow between 1%-2% each year. For next year it projected adjusted earnings per share to be $3.60 to $3.70 per share and $4.50 to $4.80 by 2022. Those EPS targets factor in HBO Max investment of 15 cents-20 cents per share in 2020, decreasing to about 10 cents per share in both 2021 and 2022. In the next three years, AT&T said it would pay off all the debt it amassed through the $85 billion transaction for Time Warner.\n\nOn Sunday, AT&T announced a $1.1 billion deal to sell its majority stake in Central European Media Enterprises. As of Sept. 30, the telco's long-term debt stood at $153.57 billion, down from $166.25 billion at the end of 2018.", "description": "AT&T promised to make\"no major acquisitions\" through 2022 and announced a three-year capital allocation plan.", "authors": ["Todd Spangler"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db6eb9adee019392a39a412?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
