The paper said officials had not limited how many people could listen to the call, which aides apparently expected to be unremarkable.\n\nThese details add to the allegations in an explosive whistleblower complaint, made public Thursday morning, involving the call as well as broader dealings with Ukraine from Trump\u2019s allies.\n\nRead more: Read the full declassified whistleblower complaint about a phone call between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president\n\nThe complaint was lodged in August by an anonymous intelligence official to the inspector general for the intelligence community.
