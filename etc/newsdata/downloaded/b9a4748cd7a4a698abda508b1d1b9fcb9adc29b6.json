The whole side. There were just holes in the side of the car. And then they start to investigate it but now it\u00b4s after the race.\n\n\"I mean, what more should he (Leclerc) do to get a penalty? I like hard racing, but I don\u00b4t think this was hard racing. This was just irresponsible driving into Turn Two.\"\n\nVerstappen, who was forced off, eventually retired in the pitlane after 15 laps while Leclerc had to pit for a new front wing.\n\nThe Monegasque had started on the front row, with team mate Sebastian Vettel on pole, but both Ferraris made poor starts with Valtteri Bottas seizing the lead for Mercedes into the first corner.\n\nVerstappen had made a strong start, from the third row, in a home race for Red Bull's engine partner Honda.\n\nVettel moved slightly before the lights went out and then stopped, escaping punishment because his tyres did not cross the line to trigger a sensor -- a decision Verstappen also questioned.\n\n\"Just watching the footage back from Seb\u00b4s start -- I mean, he moves, he stops,\" he said.\n\n\"The rule says you cannot move, and that\u00b4s fine because he didn\u00b4t gain an advantage they said. I really don\u00b4t understand what\u00b4s going on today with the rules.\"\n\nLeclerc defended himself and said it was a 'tricky situation'.\n\n\"Obviously I understeered being behind Seb and Lewis (Hamilton), and then we touched, I don't know what happened from the full situation from the outside, and this I need to look at,\" he said.
