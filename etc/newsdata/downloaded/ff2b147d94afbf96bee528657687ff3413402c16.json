In November, Chichester\u2019s Pallant House launches a series of exhibitions, including a close analysis of the relationship between Henry Moore and his patron, Walter Hussey.\n\nAt the same gallery, visitors will have the chance to see Jann Haworth\u2019s 28ft mural Work in Progress. The fascinating Radical Women: Jessica Dismorr and her Contemporaries, meanwhile, explores how the artist and her peers engaged with literature and radical politics through art.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nFor the first time, Lucian Freud\u2019s self-portraits have been arranged together in a career-spanning exhibit at the Royal Academy; the women of the Pre-Raphaelite movement are finally getting their dues at the National Portrait Gallery, and another often overlooked member, Simeon Solomon, is being honoured with an exhibition in Liverpool.\n\nSee below for information on all of this and more.\n\nRadical Women: Jessica Dismorr and her Contemporaries \u2013 Pallant House Gallery, Chichester (2 November 2019 \u2013 23 February 2020)\n\nBorn on 3 March 1885, Jessica Dismorr was one of the few English painters of the Thirties to work in an entirely abstract manner. She was the only female contributor to Group X, a short-lived British art movement launched in the years after the First World War, and one of just seven British women at DOOD (de Olympiade onder Dictatuur) Amsterdam in 1936, an exhibition set up to counter Joseph Goebbels\u200b\u2019 Nazi Art Olympiad. She pursued her work despite debilitating periods of mental illness, but ultimately took her own life in August 1939.\n\nThis exhibition, curated by Alicia Foster, comprises 80 works \u2013 including paintings, sculptures, graphic art and archive materials by Dismorr and her fellow Rhythmists, Anne Estelle Rice and Ethel Wright. There are also works by Helen Saunders, Paule Vezelay\u200b, Sophie Fedorovitch and Winifred Nicholson.\n\n\u201cContinuing our mission to champion overlooked modern British artists,\u201d explains Pallant House curator Louise Weller, \u201cRadical Women: Jessica Dismorr and her Contemporaries explores what it means to be radical, and how female artists in the early 20th century engaged with the politics and modernist literature of their time.\u201d\n\nMore information here.\n\nJann Haworth: Close Up \u2013 Pallant House Gallery, Chichester (2 November 2019 \u2013 23 February 2020)\n\nThis is the very first opportunity to witness a 2016 work by American Pop artist Jann Haworth at a UK gallery. Her Work in Progress, a 28ft mural, is the result of a major community project and celebrates women who served as catalysts for radical change in art, science and social activism (a total of 100 women, spanning 3,000 years). As well as the mural, you can see Haworth\u2019s sculpture and wall-based works from the Sixties to the present day.\n\nWork in Progress is an evolution of Haworth\u2019s collaboration with her then-husband, Peter Blake, on the iconic artwork for Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band. For this 2016 piece, Haworth and her daughter Liberty Blake organised a series of workshops in the US, where participants created stencil portraits of important women throughout history.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time Jann Haworth and Liberty Blake\u2019s mural has been exhibited in the UK,\u201d Pallant House curator Louise Weller says. \u201cIt is the result of a collaborative community project celebrating the contributions women have made to cultural and social change. It continues to grow, taking on a different significance wherever it is shown and reflecting the changing political landscape, moving between a statement of celebration and protest.\u201d\n\nMore information here.\n\nHenry Moore: The Artist and his Patron \u2013 Pallant House, Chichester (30 October 2019 \u2013 8 March 2020)\n\nAn exhibition of works bequeathed by collectors including Brenda Rawnsley and David Medd offers valuable insight into the patronage of Henry Moore by Walter Hussey, who staunchly ignored criticism from traditionalists who dismissed Moore\u2019s radical works. Key moments in Moore\u2019s career are captured here, from his wartime shelter sketches to his Surrealist drawings and Forties lithographs.\n\n\u201cPallant House was founded thanks to the generosity of Walter Hussey, the former Dean of Chichester Cathedral, who bequeathed his exceptional collection of art to us in 1985,\u201d says curator Louise Weller. \u201cThis one-room exhibition is a unique opportunity for us to explore the relationship between this remarkable patron of 20th century British art and one of Britain\u2019s greatest sculptors.\u201d\n\nMore information here.\n\nSopho Chkhikvadze: Gazing \u2013 Compass Gallery, Glasgow (Until 1 November 2019)\n\nThe Georgian-born figurative artist Sopho Chkhikvadze\u2019s works are on display at the Moscow Museum of Modern Art, the Museum Montanelli, Prague, and in numerous public and private collections throughout Europe and the UK.\n\n\u201cSopho is a fine narrator,\u201d the Compass Gallery says of her work. \u201cEach of her paintings has a particular view of everyday life and humanity, which takes as its starting point the experience of the human subject. She invites us to gaze at her enigmatic portrayals of figures in everyday situations, somewhat like looking into a personal photograph album \u2013 like a snapshot from a camera.\u201d\n\nMore information here.\n\nAntony Gormley \u2013 Royal Academy, London (Until 3 December 2019)\n\nAntony Gormley\u2019s iron casts of his own body are recognised around the world. They gaze, expressionless, out to sea on beaches in Kent and Crosby, and were displayed on rooftops during his show at the Hayward Gallery in 2007. Now they fill the exhibition halls at the Royal Academy, standing upright and projecting out from the walls and the ceiling.\n\nThe best-known British sculptor working today, Gormley follows in the footsteps of Ai Weiwei and Anselm Kiefer to take over the academy\u2019s main galleries. A series of pieces from his 45-year career are arranged alongside major new installations using organic, industrial and elemental materials, which were created for the Royal Academy. The exhibition, which is being hailed as his most ambitious exhibit in more than a decade, continues Gormley\u2019s exploration of the notion of infinite space \u2013 a visceral challenge to our perception of physics.\n\nMore information here.\n\nSimeon Solomon \u2013 Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool (End date TBC)\n\nBorn into a wealthy Jewish family in London, Simeon Solomon became involved with the Pre-Raphaelite circle after an introduction by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and held his first exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1858. His talent, good looks and charm helped him gain acceptance in the upper echelons of artistic circles with his sensuous but provocative paintings inspired by religious iconography.\n\nBy all accounts, he should have enjoyed a long and lucrative career. But it was not to be \u2013 he was arrested after being caught with a man in a public toilet, and suffered an unjust fall from grace. All but a few of his friends abandoned him, and his career was ruined. Today, a number of exhibitions, including Britain\u2019s first queer art show at Tate Britain in 2017, have made efforts to celebrate his work. Two of his most famous paintings are on display at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool: Mystery of Faith (1870) and Girl at a Fountain (1865).\n\nMore information here.\n\nGauguin Portraits \u2013 National Gallery, London (Until 26 January 2020)\n\nThe first-ever exhibition devoted to the portraits of Paul Gauguin spans his early years as an artist to the time he spent in French Polynesia.\n\n\u201cBy adding carefully selected attributes or placing the sitter into a suggestive context, Gauguin was able to make portraits that expressed meaning beyond their personalities,\u201d the National Gallery explains. \u201cA group of self-portraits, for example, reveals how Gauguin created a range of personifications including his self-image as Christ in the Garden of Olives.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Top artworks and where to see them Show all 30 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. Top artworks and where to see them 1/30 Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa (c.1503) at The Louvre, Paris It's the mysteriously serene smile of this painting's subject \u2013 thought to be Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a Florentine fabric merchant \u2013 that has given it universal fame. The portrait's small size \u2013 it measures 77 x 53 cm \u2013 can still be a surprise to those jostling for a glimpse of it, but it is the earliest Italian portrait to focus so closely on the sitter in a half-length portrait. RMN-Grand Palais (Louvre Museum) 2/30 Johannes Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring (c.1665) at the Mauritshuis in The Hague As she looks around with her slightly parted lips, you can\u2019t help but wonder what this painting's sitter is about to say. There is an almost photorealist quality to this painting of an anonymous girl with a pearl earring \u2013 immortalised by Scarlett Johannson in the 2003 film. Vermeer, the Dutch Golden Age painter, died impoverished \u2013 he only painted two or three paintings a year because he worked so slowly, and the world forgot about his work until it was rediscovered in the 19th century. 3/30 Peter Doig's Blotter (1993) at Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool There is something so tranquil and magical about Doig's paintings. This purple-hued work from a family snapshot is of his brother standing on a frozen pond and looking down into the reflection. Images reflected in water are common in his work \u2013 as seen in White Canoe (1991) and Echo Lake (2000) \u2013 and function as \u201centrances to other worlds\". National Museums Liverpool Collection 4/30 Sandro Botticelli's The Birth of Venus (1485-1486) at the Uffizi Gallery, Florence The Renaissance painting is the highlight of the Uffizi in Florence for good reason \u2013 it's a triumphant celebration of female beauty. Venus, with her long flowing hair, has been blown by the gentle breeze onto the shore of Cyprus and balances on a giant scallop shell. A young woman, thought to be Hora of spring or one of the graces, holds out a cloak covered in flowers. 5/30 Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling (1508) in Vatican City This breathtaking sequence of scenes from the Book of Genesis covers the ceiling of one of the chapels in the Vatican, and includes Michelangelo's best known fresco of the Creation of Adam. The Italian Renaissance painter was commissioned to paint it in 1508 by Pope Julius 11 \u2013 he even designed his own scaffold to paint up so high. 6/30 Gustav Klimt's The Kiss (1907-1908) at the \u00d6sterreichische Galerie Belvedere, Vienna Nothing can be as irresistibly romantic as Klimt\u2019s oil painting, which shimmers with gold leaf and depicts two lovers entwined in a loving embrace. Both wear patterned robes which reference the contemporary style of Art Nouveau and the earlier Arts and Crafts movement. It is a departure from the artist\u2019s usual portrayal of woman as the femme fatale. Belvedere 7/30 Claude Monet's Impression, Sunrise (1872) at The Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet, Paris It is easy to get lost for hours in the calmness of Monet\u2019s hazy scene of the port of Le Havre, with a rising red sun casting shadows onto small boats. When it was first shown in a group show in Paris in 1874, the painting that gave Impressionism its name was criticised for looking unfinished. 8/30 Hokurai's The Great Wave (1829-1832) at The British Museum, London There is something seductively dangerous about this enormous, claw-like wave, that is about to break and engulf three fishing boats off Kanagawa in Japan. The woodblock print is the first in the Japanese artist\u2019s series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji. It is one of the most famous Japanese artworks in the world. 9/30 Vincent van Gogh's The Starry Night (1889) at The Museum of Modern Art, New York Van Gogh painted this night sky from a view from his room at the Saint-Paul asylum in Saint-Remy, France, where he was admitted for mental illness after cutting off his own ear. With its intense swirling patterns, van Gogh manages to conjure up a whirling vista above a sleepy village, with the crescent moon, stars, Venus and orbs. The Museum of Modern Art 10/30 Rembrandt van Rijn's The Night Watch (1642) at Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam This militia painting threw formality out of the window with its sense of movement and action. Rembrandt even painted himself hidden in the scene, which depicts Captain Banning Cocq and 17 members of his civic militia guards \u2013 all of whom commissioned the painting. Rembrandt puts a spotlight on the main characters with his trademark use of light and shadow, including a woman carrying a chicken. 11/30 Theodore Gericault's The Raft of the Medusa (1818-1819) at The Louvre, Paris This lifesize painting, which measures about 16 feet by 23.5 feet, almost takes you with it on its doomed journey. The then-27-year-old Gericault drew inspiration from a real tragedy of men aboard a French naval frigate in 1816. Only 10 of the 150 men who boarded the raft lived. It is regarded as an icon of Romanticism for its emotive composition and interest in the natural world. 12/30 Tracey Emin's I Could Feel You (2014) at Tate Britain, London The Young British Artist is better known for her installations such as My Bed (1998) but it is no surprise that her paintings also hint at being candidly autobiographical in her examination of the female body. This is one of six related works on paper, each with a sensual title (Just Waiting, Stay Up, All for You), which is painted in black gouache. Tracey Emin 13/30 Mt St Victoire, Cezanne (c.1895) at Princeton University Art Museum, New Jersey Post-Impressionist painter Cezanne, with his bold, flat use of colour, painted the mountains in southern France overlooking his hometown Aix-en-Provence many times. His new ways of depicting perspective by simplifying objects to planes and geometric shapes was a big influence on the later Cubists, especially Picasso, who called him \u201cmy only master\u201d. Henry and Rose Pearlman Collection 14/30 Pablo Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) at the Museum of Modern Art, New York Picasso used geometric forms to portray the female body in this striking painting of five nude sex workers in a brothel in Barcelona. His new style kick-started Cubism, a movement that he and Georges Braque invented and which resulted in abstract and fragmented paintings. AFP/Getty 15/30 Marcel Duchamp's The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (1915-1923) at Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia Duchamp\u2019s bizarre artwork, that he declared as \u201cpermanently unfinished\u201d, is meant to evoke the erotic tension between the bride and the bachelors. Known as The Large Glass, as it is over nine feet, it comrpises two shattered glass panels suspended vertically, which contain a mechanical-like bride, a large shape that references the Milky Way, nine bachelors in geometric shapes and mechanical objects, all painted in oil to give it colour. Gaby Av 16/30 Andy warhol's Campbell's Soup Cans (1962), Andy Warhol at the Museum of Modern Art, New York This artwork, which consisted of 32 canvases, each painted with a Campbell soup can in different flavour, helped to introduce pop art as a major art movement in the US. It led to many more works depicting Campbell Soup cans over his career \u2013 ones with torn labels or opened lids, many being produced at The Factory, where studio assistants created them for him. Wally Gobetz 17/30 Bosch's The Garden of Earthy Delights (1503-1515) at Museo del Prado, Madrid The central panel of this extraordinary triptych oil painting on oak panel shows a manic utopia of male and female nudes cavorting with wild abandon, often with animals. The left panel shows Christ blessing Eve before she is presented to Adam while the right panel illustrates Hell. It is likely this work, by the Danish artist Bosch, is a warning against lust. Museo del Prado 18/30 Jasper Johns's Flag (1954-1955) at the Museum of Modern Art, New York The American artist dreamt he painted a large American flag and got on with it promptly the next morning. Now it is the painting for which he is best known, painted over strips of newspaper visible beneath the see-through paint, locating the painting in the McCarthy era and at the beginning of the Cold War. EPA 19/30 Damien Hirst's Anthraquinone-1-Diazonium Chloride (1994) at Tate Liverpool This famous example of a Spot Painting \u2013 rows of randomly coloured circles \u2013 was produced by Hirst\u2019s assistants. The artist produced about 60 Spot Paintings a year from 1986 to 2011. For Hirst, who is reportedly now the UK's richest living artist, they were just \u201ca way of pinning down the joy of colour\u201d. 20/30 Salvador Dal's The Persistence of Memory (1931) at the Museum of Modern Art, New York Time and space have a hallucinatory quality in this instantly recognisable surrealist painting of melting watches. The human face, visible on an abstract form, with its long eyelashes, represents Dali. This painting was fuelled by the artist's interest in the dream analysis of Sigmund Freud, and made him a star at the age of 28. Getty 21/30 Lucien Freud's Girl with a White Dog(1951) at Tate, London Freud was known for his psychologically complex figurative portraits, and this painting of his first wife Kitty Garman, who was pregnant at the time of the sitting, is no exception. The artist manages to reveal a multitude of emotions in the composition. He painted her many times during their short marriage, which ended in divorce in 1952, due to his many infidelities. Getty 22/30 Edvard Munch's The Scream (1893) at The National Museum, Oslo from 2020 This painting came about when Munch was overcome by fear and anxiety during a walk with two friends, and \u201cthe sky suddenly turned to red\u201d. The location was in earshot of his sister\u2019s lunatic asylum, but it is said to capture the universal anxiety of modern man. It is currently waiting to be rehoused in the new National Museum in Oslo. Nasjonalmuseet 23/30 John Henry Fuseli's The Nightmare (1781) at Detroit Institute of Art, Michigan This sexually charged painting of a woman lying across a bed, as a demonic creature crouches on her chest, has been an icon of horror, ever since it was first exhibited at the annual RA exhibition in 1782. Is she having a nightmare? Is it referencing Fuseli\u2019s own love life? Or is it about female desire? The artwork created shock and intrigue in its day and made Fuseli famous. Detroit Institute of Arts 24/30 Bridget Riley's Nataraja (1993) at Tate Modern, London When Bridget Riley first created her black and white abstract paintings in the 1960s \u2013 known as op art \u2013 the images seemed to actually move. The brightly coloured diagonal stripes in this later painting, inspired by a trip to India, also creates a sense of movement. She created it on paper in gouache, before handing it over to her studio assistants, to transfer it onto canvas. Tate 25/30 Jackson Pollock's Autumn Rhythm (Number 30) (1950) at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York Pollock had already created his first \"drip painting\" in 1947, sending shockwaves through the art world. The technique, which involved painting on a canvas laid flat on the floor and pouring, dripping, even splattering paint onto it \u2013 with a degree of control \u2013 is at its peak in Autumn Rhythm, which is evocative of nature. He died in a car crash aged 44 in 1956. Met Museum 26/30 \u00c9douard Manet's Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l\u2019herbe (1862) at the Musee d\u2019Orsay, Paris This painting caused a scandal when it was first exhibited in Paris in 1863. The scene of a naked woman having a picnic with two fully clothed men is still jarring. But in Manet\u2019s day, female nudes usually represented figures from mythology, like goddesses. This painting, which places the nude in an everyday setting, was a departure point for Modern Art as Manet refused to toe the line. RMN (Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay)/Herv\u00e9 Lewandowski 27/30 Frida Kahlo's Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird (1940) at Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas, Austin The Mexican surrealist artist found painting self-portraits therapeutic. This one reveals her suffering; her long lasting pain after a bus accident; her infertility; her divorce from artist Diego Rivera and the end of her affair with photographer Nikolas Muray. Bursting with symbolism from Mexican folklore, it is a jigsaw puzzle of meaning. AFP/Getty 28/30 Diego Vel\u00e1zquez's Las Meninas (1656) at Museo Nacional del Prado, Madrid, Spain The leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age captures himself working on a large canvas in this realistic portrayal of the Spanish court, where he was court painter. The young princess Infanta Margarita Theresa is surrounded by servants, while her parents King Philip 1V of Spain and Mariana of Austria, watch the scene from a doorway. It holds plenty of mystery as to the relationship between the viewer and the characters depicted. For example, does the mirror reflect the hidden picture on the easel? 29/30 Henri Matisse's Conversation (1908-1912) at the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg What are they talking about? It looks serious. Matisse\u2019s oil painting depicts the artist and his wife Amelie in conversation against an intense sapphire blue colour. Matisse wears striped pyjamas, which were fashionable as leisurewear in 20th century France. It was painted in his country house, and there is a tension in the way his wife sits \u2013 understandable, given that he reportedly once told her that he loved painting more than her. Gandalf's Gallery 30/30 Sir John Everett Millais's Ophelia (1851-1852) at Tate Britain, London A drowning Ophelia from Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet is slowly sinking into the stream. The Pre-Raphaelite artist recreated, with breathtaking attention to detail, the consequence of Hamlet\u2019s murder of her father. His 19-year old model, Lizzie Siddal, nearly died of a cold from lying in a bath fully clothed for hours, long after oil lamps used to keep the bath water warm went out. The artist did not notice but ended up paying her doctor\u2019s bills. John Everett Millais 1/30 Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa (c.1503) at The Louvre, Paris It's the mysteriously serene smile of this painting's subject \u2013 thought to be Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a Florentine fabric merchant \u2013 that has given it universal fame.

Museo del Prado 18/30 Jasper Johns's Flag (1954-1955) at the Museum of Modern Art, New York The American artist dreamt he painted a large American flag and got on with it promptly the next morning. Now it is the painting for which he is best known, painted over strips of newspaper visible beneath the see-through paint, locating the painting in the McCarthy era and at the beginning of the Cold War. EPA 19/30 Damien Hirst's Anthraquinone-1-Diazonium Chloride (1994) at Tate Liverpool This famous example of a Spot Painting \u2013 rows of randomly coloured circles \u2013 was produced by Hirst\u2019s assistants. The artist produced about 60 Spot Paintings a year from 1986 to 2011. For Hirst, who is reportedly now the UK's richest living artist, they were just \u201ca way of pinning down the joy of colour\u201d. 20/30 Salvador Dal's The Persistence of Memory (1931) at the Museum of Modern Art, New York Time and space have a hallucinatory quality in this instantly recognisable surrealist painting of melting watches. The human face, visible on an abstract form, with its long eyelashes, represents Dali. This painting was fuelled by the artist's interest in the dream analysis of Sigmund Freud, and made him a star at the age of 28. Getty 21/30 Lucien Freud's Girl with a White Dog(1951) at Tate, London Freud was known for his psychologically complex figurative portraits, and this painting of his first wife Kitty Garman, who was pregnant at the time of the sitting, is no exception. The artist manages to reveal a multitude of emotions in the composition. He painted her many times during their short marriage, which ended in divorce in 1952, due to his many infidelities. Getty 22/30 Edvard Munch's The Scream (1893) at The National Museum, Oslo from 2020 This painting came about when Munch was overcome by fear and anxiety during a walk with two friends, and \u201cthe sky suddenly turned to red\u201d. The location was in earshot of his sister\u2019s lunatic asylum, but it is said to capture the universal anxiety of modern man. It is currently waiting to be rehoused in the new National Museum in Oslo. Nasjonalmuseet 23/30 John Henry Fuseli's The Nightmare (1781) at Detroit Institute of Art, Michigan This sexually charged painting of a woman lying across a bed, as a demonic creature crouches on her chest, has been an icon of horror, ever since it was first exhibited at the annual RA exhibition in 1782. Is she having a nightmare? Is it referencing Fuseli\u2019s own love life? Or is it about female desire? The artwork created shock and intrigue in its day and made Fuseli famous. Detroit Institute of Arts 24/30 Bridget Riley's Nataraja (1993) at Tate Modern, London When Bridget Riley first created her black and white abstract paintings in the 1960s \u2013 known as op art \u2013 the images seemed to actually move. The brightly coloured diagonal stripes in this later painting, inspired by a trip to India, also creates a sense of movement. She created it on paper in gouache, before handing it over to her studio assistants, to transfer it onto canvas. Tate 25/30 Jackson Pollock's Autumn Rhythm (Number 30) (1950) at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York Pollock had already created his first \"drip painting\" in 1947, sending shockwaves through the art world. The technique, which involved painting on a canvas laid flat on the floor and pouring, dripping, even splattering paint onto it \u2013 with a degree of control \u2013 is at its peak in Autumn Rhythm, which is evocative of nature. He died in a car crash aged 44 in 1956. Met Museum 26/30 \u00c9douard Manet's Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l\u2019herbe (1862) at the Musee d\u2019Orsay, Paris This painting caused a scandal when it was first exhibited in Paris in 1863. The scene of a naked woman having a picnic with two fully clothed men is still jarring. But in Manet\u2019s day, female nudes usually represented figures from mythology, like goddesses. This painting, which places the nude in an everyday setting, was a departure point for Modern Art as Manet refused to toe the line. RMN (Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay)/Herv\u00e9 Lewandowski 27/30 Frida Kahlo's Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird (1940) at Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas, Austin The Mexican surrealist artist found painting self-portraits therapeutic. This one reveals her suffering; her long lasting pain after a bus accident; her infertility; her divorce from artist Diego Rivera and the end of her affair with photographer Nikolas Muray. Bursting with symbolism from Mexican folklore, it is a jigsaw puzzle of meaning. AFP/Getty 28/30 Diego Vel\u00e1zquez's Las Meninas (1656) at Museo Nacional del Prado, Madrid, Spain The leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age captures himself working on a large canvas in this realistic portrayal of the Spanish court, where he was court painter. The young princess Infanta Margarita Theresa is surrounded by servants, while her parents King Philip 1V of Spain and Mariana of Austria, watch the scene from a doorway. It holds plenty of mystery as to the relationship between the viewer and the characters depicted. For example, does the mirror reflect the hidden picture on the easel? 29/30 Henri Matisse's Conversation (1908-1912) at the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg What are they talking about? It looks serious. Matisse\u2019s oil painting depicts the artist and his wife Amelie in conversation against an intense sapphire blue colour. Matisse wears striped pyjamas, which were fashionable as leisurewear in 20th century France. It was painted in his country house, and there is a tension in the way his wife sits \u2013 understandable, given that he reportedly once told her that he loved painting more than her. Gandalf's Gallery 30/30 Sir John Everett Millais's Ophelia (1851-1852) at Tate Britain, London A drowning Ophelia from Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet is slowly sinking into the stream. The Pre-Raphaelite artist recreated, with breathtaking attention to detail, the consequence of Hamlet\u2019s murder of her father. His 19-year old model, Lizzie Siddal, nearly died of a cold from lying in a bath fully clothed for hours, long after oil lamps used to keep the bath water warm went out. The artist did not notice but ended up paying her doctor\u2019s bills. John Everett Millais\n\nAbout 50 works are featured, including paintings, sketches, and multi-media objects from public and private collections around the world.\n\nMore information here.\n\nBridget Riley \u2013 Hayward Gallery, London (Until 26 January 2020)\n\nThe Hayward Gallery is presenting a major retrospective dedicated to the work of one of the most influential exponents of \u201cOp art\u201d (\u201cop\u201d being short for optical). Alongside many of her best-known canvases, such as the eye-popping High Sky, there are rarely seen portrait drawings and studies of friends made in the Eighties. Visitors will also be able to witness the works that link her later abstract paintings and early figurative works, such as Pink Landscape, which applied the techniques Riley acquired by studying French Impressionist painter Georges Seurat. Often overwhelming but always brilliant, Riley\u2019s works demand your attention whether at close quarters or standing from a distance.\n\nMore information here.\n\nPre-Raphaelite Sisters \u2013 National Portrait Gallery, London (Until 26 January 2020)\n\nA new exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery shines a light on the oft-overlooked women of the Pre-Raphaelite movement, from Elizabeth Siddal to Fanny Cornforth. Collecting paintings, poetry, letters and other important pieces from the time, the exhibition\u2019s curators reveal the women behind the pictures and the essential role they played in the successive Pre-Raphaelite phases between 1850 and 1900.\n\nSome, such as Christina Rossetti, were literal sisters \u2013 she modelled for Dante Gabriel Rossetti in Ecce Ancilla Domini, while he illustrated her poem \u201cGoblin Market\u201d. Other stars of the exhibit were wives, lovers, models and muses, or poets and artists in their own right \u2013 just as talented, but frequently omitted from history. Until now.\n\nMore information here.\n\nDrawing on Nature: Taki Katei\u2019s Japan \u2013 World Museum, Liverpool (Until 13 April 2020)\n\nOnce a celebrated artist, Taki Katei had his paintings displayed in Japan\u2019s Imperial Court. After his death, however, the demand for his style fell out of fashion, and his work was slowly forgotten. The World Museum is now showing an astonishing collection of ink drawings and watercolours by the artist as well as telling the story of how his work travelled from Tokyo to Liverpool. The exhibition is split into five themes to help visitors examine the hidden meanings in his work.\n\nMore information here.\n\nLucian Freud: The Self-portraits \u2013 Royal Academy, London (Until 26 January 2020)\n\nThis is the first time that Freud\u2019s self-portraits have been united in a single exhibition. More than 50 paintings, sketches and prints are currently on display at the Royal Academy, offering a fascinating insight into his development as a painter. The works span from his earliest portrait, completed in 1939, to his final one 64 years later, so visitors will be able to see the artist\u2019s evolution from delicate lines and a more graphic style to the rugged, fleshier paintings of his later years. Due to high demand, visiting hours have been extended to 8pm every Saturday until 3 December. The exhibition is also open until 10pm on Fridays.\n\nMore information here.\n\nOn Refusal: Representation & Resistance in Contemporary American Art \u2013 The MAC, Belfast (Until 19 January 2020)\n\nThis group exhibition is taking place across all three of the MAC\u2019s galleries, and looks at how a number of American artists explore themes of representation, refusal and resistance. It includes works by Elliott Jerome Brown Jr, Aria Dean, Paul Stephen Benjamin and Sable Elyse Smith. Amid the tumultuous political and social landscape of the US and the UK, and renewed debates surrounding border politics in Northern Ireland, these works will speak to systems of oppression and institutionalised violence.\n\nMore information here.\n\nDerek Jarman Protest! \u2013 IMMA, Dublin (15 November until 23 February 2020), and then at Manchester Art Gallery (2 April 2020 \u2013 31 August 2020)\n\nThis major retrospective, which marks 25 years since Jarman\u2019s death, is based on the eclectic works of one of the most influential figures in 20th-century British culture. A painter, filmmaker, writer, set-designer, gardener and political activist, Jarman engaged fiercely with art and society. The exhibit comprises major works from the Sixties to the Nineties, many of which have never been seen in public before. Included is a series of large canvases he produced in the Nineties, which used tabloid newspaper headlines that spread panic and disinformation about Aids (Jarman was diagnosed as HIV-positive in 1986).\n\nMore information here.\n\nRembrandt\u2019s Light \u2013 Dulwich Picture Gallery, London (Until 2 February)\n\nThe design and lighting of Rembrandt\u2019s Light exhibition has been specially tailored to immerse audiences in his work and offer a new way of looking at one of the greatest artists who ever lived. It marks 350 years since his death with 35 paintings, etchings and drawings, including major loans from the Louvre and Amsterdam\u2019s Rijksmuseum. There\u2019s a particular focus on Rembrandt\u2019s output between 1639-1658, when he lived in Breestraat, Amsterdam. Highlights include Philemon and Baucis, which is shown in the UK for the first time, as well as three of Rembrandt\u2019s most famous paintings of women: A Woman Bathing in a Stream, A Woman in Bed and Girl at a Window.\n\nMore information here.\n\nWilliam Blake \u2013 Tate Britain, London (Until 2 February 2020)\n\nMore than 300 works will form the largest Blake exhibition in almost 20 years, and reposition him as a visual artist for the 21st century. As famous for his paintings and prints as he is for his poetry, Blake has created some of the most iconic images in British art history. The exhibition shows his work as he intended it to be experienced, in the form of vast frescos projected on to the walls of the gallery. Highlights include Newton, The Ghost of a Flea, and a section dedicated to his illuminated texts, such as Songs of Innocence and of Experience.\n\nMore information here.\n\nArtist Room: August Sander \u2013 National Museum Wales, Cardiff (Until 1 March 2020)\n\nRegarded as the most important German photographer of the early 20th century, August Sander celebrated the importance of the individual with his portraits. More than anything, he wanted to represent the breadth and variety in German society, by photographing farmers, secretaries, policemen and politicians. This exhibition at the National Museum Wales in Cardiff includes more than 170 modern prints produced from the original plates by Sander\u2019s grandson, Gerd Sander.\n\nMore information here.\n\nTroy: Myth and Reality \u2013 British Museum, London (21 November 2019 until 8 March 2020)\n\nOne hundred and fifty years ago, the British Museum turned down German millionaire-archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann\u2019s offer to exhibit his findings from Hisarlik in northwestern Turkey, claiming a lack of space. Remarkably, this is still the first time a major exhibition on Troy has taken place in Britain. It features 300 objects dating from the Bronze Age to the present day, and investigates how the heroes, heartbroken, women and wanderers said to have played a part in the Trojan War continue to inspire retellings.\n\nMore information here.", "description": "There are a number of fantastic art exhibitions taking place around the UK and Ireland this winter, from major retrospectives of artists such as Bridget Riley, William Blake and Lucian Freud, to a display of objects linked to the ancient Greek city of Troy.", "authors": ["Roisin O'Connor"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/28/11/composite-exhibitions.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
