I just wrote a song and, thankfully, people seemed to like it.\"\n\nCapaldi's lovelorn ballad spent seven weeks at number one in the UK over the summer, and has also topped the charts in Canada, Ireland, Malaysia and the Czech Republic.\n\nIn the US, however, it has been a sleeper hit, taking 24 weeks to reach the summit; where it replaces Lizzo's Truth Hurts.\n\n\"I feel like America's sweetheart, at least for a moment,\" Capaldi told Billboard magazine. \"I feel like I'm the sweetest heart in all of the US of A.\"\n\n\"I feel like I'm a wrestler, and I'm just walking out [to the ring] and there's an American flag, and I'm saying, 'USA! USA!' That's what I feel like, a wrestler.\"\n\nThe 23-year-old, who still lives with his parents, added that breaking the US meant, \"I'll be able to pay the rent for the next few months!\"\n\nOther Scottish musicians to top the US single charts include Annie Lennox, Rod Stewart and Calvin Harris - however all of them did so as part of a group, or as a featured artist.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
