Sports Illustrated reported he repeatedly yelled toward a group of female reporters about closer Roberto Osuna, who was suspended for 75 games last year for violating MLB\u2019s domestic violence policy before being traded from Toronto to the Astros.\n\nTaubman shouted \u201cThank God we got Osuna!\u201d according to SI, which said he made similar remarks several times, punctuating them with a profanity.\n\nManfred wasn\u2019t sure how long the investigation will need.\n\nHOUSTON (AP) - Commissioner Rob Manfred says Major League Baseball will look into a politicized tweet by umpire Rob Drake that referenced a rifle and criticism of President Donald Trump.\n\nDrake posted this message to Twitter: \u201cI will be buying an AR-15 tomorrow, because if you impeach MY PRESIDENT this way, YOU WILL HAVE ANOTHER CIVAL WAR!!! #MAGA2020\u201d\n\nThe tweet has since been deleted.\n\nManfred spoke at Minute Maid Park on Wednesday night before Game 2 of the World Series between the Houston Astros and Washington Nationals.\n\nDrake, 50, has worked spring training or regular-season major league games since 1999 and joined the big league staff in 2010. Drake was not assigned to work the postseason this year.\n\nHOUSTON (AP) - Major League Baseball and its players\u2019 union are optimistic talks are progressing on testing for opioids following the death of Los Angeles Angels pitcher Tyler Skaggs.\n\n\u201cThe dialogue in this has been really positive with the players association, a lot of common ground on addressing the issue,\u201d Commissioner Rob Manfred said before Game 2 of the World Series. \u201cWe understand that our workforce is a microcosm of society. There\u2019s a societal problem.\u201d\n\nSkaggs was found dead in his hotel room on July 1 before the start of a series against the Texas Rangers. The Tarrant County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office said the 27-year-old died after choking on his vomit with a toxic mix of alcohol and the painkillers fentanyl and oxycodone in his body.\n\nWhile the joint program of MLB and the players\u2019 association has testing with penalties for performance-enhancing drugs and banned stimulants, opioids are included in drugs of abuse and not subject to testing with penalties for players on 40-man rosters.\n\nBOXING\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) - Boxing promoter Oscar De La Hoya denies accusations of sexual assault contained in a lawsuit filed against him this week.\n\nDe La Hoya\u2019s company, Golden Boy Promotions, issued a statement describing the action as a \u201cfrivolous lawsuit\u201d and calling the allegations \u201ccompletely false.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit filed Monday in Los Angeles County Superior Court alleges that the unnamed woman had a consensual sexual relationship with De La Hoya until he assaulted her at his home in Pasadena in November 2017.\n\nThe lawsuit goes into graphic detail in its allegations against De La Hoya, claiming the former boxing champion was intoxicated at the time that he overpowered the woman. The lawsuit doesn\u2019t specify whether she filed a complaint with the police after the alleged attack, which left her requiring medication for \u201cextreme swelling and pain.\u201d\n\nThe complainant says she went to a hospital after the alleged attack and eventually sought psychological treatment, during which she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. The woman claims she still has daily symptoms of depression and anxiety.\n\nGolden Boy Promotions\u2019 statement suggests De La Hoya is being extorted.\n\nPRO FOOTBALL\n\nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) - The Patriots have placed receiver Josh Gordon on injured reserve with knee and ankle injuries.\n\nThe move was posted on the NFL\u2019s transaction wire.\n\nGordon suffered the injuries during New England\u2019s win over the Giants in Week 6 and sat out Monday night\u2019s win over the Jets. He did not participate when the Patriots returned to the practice field on Wednesday.\n\nGordon\u2019s absence will mean the Patriots will now be leaning even more on veteran Mohamed Sanu, acquired in a trade with Atlanta on Tuesday, to provide some stability to an offense that leads the league in scoring at nearly 32 points a game.\n\nGordon was among New England\u2019s leading receivers this season. In six games he has 20 catches for 287 yards and a touchdown.\n\nThis marks the second abbreviated season for Gordon. Following a trade from Cleveland last season, he appeared in 11 games for the Patriots before being suspended indefinitely last December for violations of the league\u2019s substance abuse policy.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "BASEBALL", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
