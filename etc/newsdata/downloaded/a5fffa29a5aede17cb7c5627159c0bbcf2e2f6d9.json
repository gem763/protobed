At least that's what Ivanka Trump seems to think, after marking her 38th birthday on Wednesday by showing off her wrinkle-free complexion in a makeup-free, pouty-faced snap - while noting that she feels '38 years young'.\n\nThe first daughter shared the candid photo with her followers first thing in the morning, writing alongside it: 'Hugs, kisses and lots of birthday wishes,' before adding a kissing-face emoji and the hashtage #38yearsyoung.\n\nIn the slightly blurred photo, Ivanka can be seen showing off a very smooth complexion that appears to be makeup-free; in a break from the glamorous outfits she has been modeling recently, the mother-of-three appears to be wearing a black workout top.\n\nCelebration: Ivanka Trump marked her 38th birthday on Wednesday by sharing a makeup-free pouty-faced selfie on Instagram\n\nHer short blonde locks meanwhile are pushed back from her face in a messy, straight style.\n\nIt is possible that Ivanka kicked off her birthday with a run; both she and Jared are keen runners, and have been known to enjoy morning workouts in their neighborhood.\n\nDouble trouble: She also shared the snap on her Instagram Story, this time with a special pink border\n\nWhether it was endorphins or just a feeling of birthday joy, Ivanka certainly appeared to be in high spirits when she snapped her photo.\n\nThe first daughter hammed it up for the shot, puckering her lips and making an exaggerated kissy face at the camera.\n\nNo doubt eager to share her celebratory mood with as many of her followers as possible, Ivanka also posted the snap on her Instagram Story, where it appeared with a special pink border.\n\nInstead of typing the caption out with Instagram's built-in text options, it appears Ivanka used an external app to edit the image and add stylized wording - echoing the same sentiment that she shared on her main feed.\n\nAs well as the photos, Ivanka also re-posted a tribute video made by one of her fan pages, which features dozens of clips of her throughout the year.\n\nFrom her official four-day tour in Africa in April and her June trip to the G20 summit in Japan to her many official White House meetings, the sweet clip captures many of the first daughter's highlights from throughout the year.\n\nDay of work: On Tuesday, Ivanka attended a meeting of the President's Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons\n\nSidekick: The first daughter sat next to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at the meeting, where she put on a rather more glamorous appearance than in her birthday selfie\n\nSaying goodbye: Ivanka gave Pompeo a kiss on the cheek after the meeting was over\n\n'Thank you @alwaysivanka for creating this amazing birthday video,' Ivanka wrote while sharing it on her own Instagram account. 'I've done a lot of living in the last 12 months!!! The best is yet to come.'\n\nThe lighthearted posts come after the first daughter made a rather more glamorous and put together appearance at a meeting of the president's Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (PITF) in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on Tuesday.\n\nIvanka donned a black dress with white polka dots and gold buttons going down the front for the occasion, and her sleek blonde bob was poker-straight. She also sported her signature smokey eye makeup and dusty rose lipstick.\n\nThe White House senior adviser was seen giving Secretary of State Mike Pompeo a kiss on the cheek when she left the meeting and shared a laugh with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar while on her way out.\n\nIt has been a week of celebrations for Ivanka, who also marked her tenth wedding anniversary with Jared Kushner on Friday.\n\nCelebration: Ivanka paid tribute to her husband Jared Kushner on Instagram on Friday morning in honor of their 10-year wedding anniversary\n\nLooking back: The first daughter shared three portraits from their wedding, which took place at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, on October 25, 2009\n\nIn honor of the special occasion, Ivanka penned a gushing tribute to him and their decade-long marriage on Instagram, sharing three photos from their wedding, which took place at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, on October 25, 2009.\n\nThe first portrait shows Jared and Ivanka beaming for the camera. The second is a picture of them sharing a kiss underneath the fall foliage, and in the third, they are seen touching noses and smiling at each other.\n\n'Today marks a decade of marriage to my best friend and life partner: 3,652 days, 3 amazing, curious children, countless adventures, ups, downs, laughter, love and pastrami together,' Ivanka captioned the images.\n\n'Everything about you is real, kind, humble and brave. You inspire me with your calm, stoic disposition and unwavering prioritization of that which matters most in life,' she continued. 'You are a dedicated public servant, amazing father and relentless optimist who never confuses a hard problem with one that is unsolvable.\n\n'Everything about me is revealed and known to you. You see all of me and love me for exactly who I am. I can be vulnerable with you, as well as strong and determined. I love you and dream of forever together.'", "description": "The first daughter celebrates her 38th birthday on Wednesday, October 30 and she celebrated by posting a selfie on Instagram that shows her making a kissy face at the camera.", "authors": ["Charlie Lankston For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/13/20377690-0-image-a-73_1572443360017.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
