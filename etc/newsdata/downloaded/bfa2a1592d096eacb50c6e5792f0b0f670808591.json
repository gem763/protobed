Some late-session trade headlines didn\u2019t help matters. Let\u2019s look at a few top stock trades in deep detail.\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow #1: ROKU\n\ntop stock trades for ROKU More\n\nWe covered Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) earlier this week, but given the drumming that it took Friday \u2014 down more than 20% at one point \u2014 I thought it was worth looking at again.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nShares bounced on Thursday following a test of the 50-day moving average. However, they began Friday under pressure after Pivotal Research initiated the stock with a sell rating and $60 price target.\n\nWhere are we now?\n\n\n\nThe 100-day is at $109.70, while the gap-fill from the post-earnings surge is down at $100.97. Near there is the 50% retracement for the one-year range at $101.43.\n\nIn between the downside levels (the gap fill and the 50% retracement), and the upside (the 100-day moving average), is Roku stock price.\n\nWhen shares were trading at $105.93 \u2014 which they were at one point on Friday \u2014 it was down 40% from its highs. From its peak, Roku stock fell about 60% in Q4. So this name has a tendency to shed some weight, but it has given investors an opportunity to get long too. A few lucky ones did.\n\nWith 45 minutes to go in the session, Roku stock already surpassed 57 million shares traded. It feels greedy, but I would love to see Roku fill its gap back down to ~$101. A lower open on Monday that reclaims Friday\u2019s close would be the reversal that short-term traders need to get long this one again.\n\nOver the 100-day moving average could get a squeeze going up to the 38.2% near $119 and possibly the 50-day near $128.\n\n\n\nIf the gap-fill level and the 50% retracement doesn\u2019t hold, the August lows near $96 are on the table. A flush lower from there would be possible if buyers don\u2019t step up and defend Roku.\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow #2: Amazon\n\ntop stock trades for AMZN More\n\nWith the stock market near its all-time highs and with several mega-cap tech companies back in favor \u2014 like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) \u2014 it\u2019s interesting to see Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) act as a laggard.\n\nShares are down almost 12% off the July highs, when it looked like Amazon stock was going to breakout.\n\n\n\nThe stock has spent 2019 putting in a series of higher lows (blue line), although AMZN is threatening to break that trend should it continue much lower. Adding more weight to the current price action, the 200-day moving average is about $20 per share below current levels.\n\nShould AMZN lose uptrend support and the 200-day moving average, range support at $1,750 will almost instantly be on the table. Further, the 61.8% retracement is in this area too, at $1,757. If this area fails, then the June lows near $1,672 will be in the cards as Amazon stumbles into no man\u2019s land.\n\nOn the upside, look to see how the stock does with the $1,850 area. There it has range resistance and the 50-day moving average. At $1,879 is the 78.6% retracement. Over this area puts $2,000+ back on the table.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of detail to absorb. So try to keep it simple. Below the 200-day moving average, and range support at $1,750 is on the table. Below that mark is bearish. If the 200-day holds, $1,850 resistance is on the table. Above that is bullish and over $1,880 puts $2,000+ in the realm of possibilities.\n\nIn between is chop.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow #3: S&P 500 (SPY)", "description": "It was a quadruple witching day on Wall Street, leading to extra volatility on Friday.
