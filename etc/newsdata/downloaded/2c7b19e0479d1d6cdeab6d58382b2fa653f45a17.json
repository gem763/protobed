I can\u2019t put it into words,\u201d Knight said.\n\nBrittany Altomare and Jaye Marie Green tied for second at 16-under, giving the US the top three spots in the event at The Colony, Texas.\n\nKnight came into the tournament needing a top five finish to crack the top 100 on the LPGA money list and ended up taking home her biggest career prize, $195,000.\n\nShe is also the fourth American winner in 2019, joining Cydney Clanton, Nelly Korda and Lexi Thompson.\n\nUntil Sunday\u2019s victory, there wasn\u2019t much for Knight to write home about in her rookie season. She missed the cut in half of her 18 starts on the Tour and was looking a relegation to the qualifying series.\n\nThat all changed this week as she earned a two-year exemption and will play in the CME Globe Tour Championship in November.\n\nShe grew up about an hour\u2019s drive away in Aledo, Texas. She wanted to dedicate her first victory to her late brother, Brandon, who died in a car accident when Cheyenne was just 12.\n\n\u201cI think I had a second caddie. I know he\u2019s watching in heaven, and he\u2019s so proud of me,\u201d a teary-eyed Knight said. \u201cThis is for Brandon.\u201d\n\nAltomare shot a 67 and third-round leader Green closed with a 69.\n\nEngland\u2019s Georgia Hall, who had one of the best rounds of the day with a five-under 66, finished in a tie for fourth with Jane Park of the US who had a 68.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s Stephanie Meadow and Katherine Perry tied for sixth at 10-under 274, eight strokes adrift of Knight.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 Texan Cheyenne Knight captured her first US LPGA Tour title in her native Lone Star State on Sunday, firing a 66 for a two-shot", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/67afc1_cheyenne-knight-tees-off-on-hole-final-volunteers-america-classic-golf-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
