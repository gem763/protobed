I am in discussions with an established London law firm and two senior barristers with a view to challenging Benn Act through Courts.\n\n'We must not allow our opponents to bind the hands of PM as he negotiates with overseas power.'\n\nMr Johnson has consistently referred to the anti-No Deal law - introduced by Labour Party politician Hilary Benn - as the 'surrender' act.\n\nYesterday afternoon, Mr Kawczynski confirmed he was thinking of launching his legal challenge against the bill.\n\nHe said yesterday: 'Following personal meeting with Barristers today I have shared written legal advice on loopholes in \"Surrender Act\" with colleagues.\n\n'Barristers believe we have case to take to Courts and encouraging me to pursue. Reflecting over weekend.'\n\nBoris Johnson, pictured leaving Downing Street on Thursday, has apparently conceded that he will have to ask the EU for a Brexit delay if there no divorce agreement in place by October 19\n\nLeo Varadkar, pictured in Copenhagen today, said he would back a Brexit delay if the alternative was a No Deal split\n\nHis move comes as yesterday clarity appeared to emerge over Mr Johnson's seemingly contradictory positions on the act.\n\nHe has long maintained that he will stick to his 'do or die' pledge to deliver Brexit with or without a deal by October 31.\n\nBut he has also insisted that the government will abide by an anti-No Deal law passed by rebel MPs.\n\nThe Court of Session in Scotland yesterday heard that government papers said the PM will comply with the law and seek an extension if he is unable to strike an accord with the bloc.\n\nDocuments submitted to the Court on behalf of Mr Johnson were read out and in them it is made clear he will not attempt to frustrate the so-called Benn Act.\n\nDowning Street did not deny that was an accurate representation of Mr Johnson's position but said that they would not be commenting further.\n\nHowever, Mr Johnson subsequently recommitted to his 'do or die' promise as he tweeted: 'New deal or no deal - but no delay.'\n\nA senior Number 10 source told the BBC the government remained of the view that a Brexit delay could be avoided even if Mr Johnson is forced to ask for one.\n\nFor example, the government could ask for a delay to comply with the law while also making clear in public and private that it will not negotiate any further with the EU.\n\nIt came as Leo Varadkar, the Irish Taoiseach, said Ireland would likely agree to a request from the UK for a Brexit extension if the alternative was a No Deal divorce.\n\nSpeaking during a visit to Denmark yesterday, Mr Varadkar said: 'I've always said that Brexit doesn't end with the UK leaving, it's just the next phase of negotiations.\n\n'But if the UK were to request an extension, we would consider it, most EU countries would only consider it for good reason, but an extension would be better than No Deal.'\n\nBrexiteer Steve Baker, the chairman of the European Research Group of Tory MPs, appeared to suggest that the government could still find a way around a delay as he responded to the court case.\n\nHe tweeted: 'A source confirms all this means is that government will obey the law. It does not mean we will extend.\n\n'It does not mean we will stay in the EU beyond Oct 31. We will leave.'\n\nBrexiteer Steve Baker (pictured), the chairman of the European Research Group of Tory MPs, appeared to suggest that the government could still find a way around a delay as he responded to the court case\n\nMr Baker's comments combined with the Number 10 source suggest Mr Johnson may ultimately be forced to ask for a delay but that he could at the same time try to scupper it.\n\nHowever, even if he was to make clear he does not personally want an extension, the act of asking for one would still be politically damaging given that he said at the start of September he would rather be 'dead in a ditch' than push back Brexit.\n\nWhether or not the EU would be willing to postpone Brexit in such chaotic circumstances is unclear.\n\nBut Mr Varadkar made clear yesterday that he was in favour of a delay if the alternative was a chaotic split on October 31.\n\nSpeaking alongside the Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen, who also signalled his support for a Brexit extension, the Taoiseach said he still believes a deal is possible before the current deadline.\n\nHe said: 'Our focus is on securing an agreement and getting a deal at the EU Council Summit [on October 17-18].\n\n'I believe that's possible but in order for it to be possible all sides have to reaffirm the shared objectives, when this started two or three years ago, coming to an agreement required no hard border between Ireland, north and south, that the integrity of the Single Market of the European Union will be protected, and that the all-island economy will be protected.\n\n'What we need to do is refocus on those objectives and come to an agreement by the middle of October, and I think that is possible.'\n\nLegal action launched at the Outer House of the Court of Session yesterday seeks to create an order which would force Mr Johnson to send the extension letter set out in the Benn Act and prohibit him from trying to frustrate the Act's purpose.\n\nThat could include banning him from asking EU member states to reject the letter he will be legally obliged to send or by sending an additional letter which contradicts the first.\n\nAidan O'Neill QC, representing the campaigners behind the legal action, claimed Mr Johnson's previous statements go against what he has said to the court through the documents.\n\nMr O'Neill said: 'We can't trust this government, in light of statements it has made, that it will comply with the law.'\n\nThe trio behind the court action - businessman Vince Dale, SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC and Jolyon Maugham QC - are seeking an order to ensure Mr Johnson requests an extension if he refuses to abide by the terms of the Benn Act.\n\nYesterday's court battle comes just over a week after Mr Johnson was humiliated in the Supreme Court as judges ruled unanimously his prorogation of Parliament was unlawful.\n\nThe so-called Benn Act was passed by Parliament last month and it requires the government to ask for a Brexit extension until January 31 if an agreement is not reached with the EU by October 19.", "description": "Tory MP Daniel Kawczynski, who represents\u00a0Shrewsbury, has said he has been speaking to barristers about launching a possible challenge to the\u00a0anti-No Deal law.", "authors": ["James Wood For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/12/19330846-0-image-a-80_1570274048352.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
