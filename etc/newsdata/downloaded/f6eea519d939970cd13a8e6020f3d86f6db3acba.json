The attacker is believed to have entered through a back door.\n\nThe two deceased individuals were both males and the 14 people wounded included some who were not wounded by gunshots, but were hurt during the rush for windows and doors after shots rang out.\n\nCNN reports that party attendees have been \u201creluctant\u201d to provide Hunt County Sheriff Randy Meeks with a description of the attacker.\n\nMeeks commented on the situation, saying, \u201cIt appalls me that, as many folks that were there, (they) have not been able to give us a better description of this shooter. Due to the many different descriptions being provided by those in attendance at that party, we unfortunately do not have any solid suspect information to provide at this time.\u201d\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
