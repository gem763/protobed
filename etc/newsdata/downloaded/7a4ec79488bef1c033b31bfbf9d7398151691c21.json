The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the internal deliberations.\n\nIran called the U.S. claims \u201cmaximum lies\u201d and threatened American forces in the region. The attack dimmed hopes for potential nuclear talks between Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at the U.N. General Assembly this week.\n\nThe U.S. government produced satellite photos showing what officials said were at least 19 points of impact at two Saudi energy facilities, including damage at the heart of the kingdom\u2019s crucial oil processing plant at Abqaiq. Officials said the photos show impacts consistent with the attack coming from the direction of Iran or Iraq, rather than from Yemen to the south.\n\nIraq denied that its territory was used for an attack on the kingdom. U.S. officials said a strike from there would be a violation of Iraq\u2019s sovereignty.\n\nThe U.S. officials said additional devices, which apparently didn\u2019t reach their targets, were recovered northwest of the facilities and are being jointly analyzed by Saudi and American intelligence. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, did not address whether the drone could have been fired from Yemen, then taken a round-about path, but did not explicitly rule it out.\n\nThe attacks and recriminations are increasing already heightened fears of an escalation in the region, after a prominent U.S. senator suggested striking Iranian oil refineries in response to the assault, and Iran warned of the potential of more violence.\n\n\u201cBecause of the tension and sensitive situation, our region is like a powder keg,\u201d said Iranian Brig. Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh. \u201cWhen these contacts come too close, when forces come into contact with one another, it is possible a conflict happens because of a misunderstanding.\u201d\n\nActions on any side could break into the open a twilight war that\u2019s been raging just below the surface of the wider Persian Gulf in recent months. Already, there have been mysterious attacks on oil tankers that America blames on Tehran, at least one suspected Israeli strike on Shiite forces in Iraq, and Iran shooting down a U.S. military surveillance drone.\n\nThe attack Saturday on Saudi Arabia\u2019s Abqaiq plant and its Khurais oil field led to the interruption of an estimated 5.7 million barrels of the kingdom\u2019s crude oil production per day, equivalent to more than 5% of the world\u2019s daily supply. It remains unclear how King Salman and his assertive son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, will respond to an attack targeting the heart of the Saudi oil industry.\n\nCrude oil futures shot up 9.5% to $60 as trading opened Sunday evening in New York, a dramatic increase.\n\nSaudi Arabia has promised to fill in the cut in production with its reserves, but has not said how long it will take to repair the damage. The Wall Street Journal cited Saudi officials as saying a third of output would be restored on Monday, but a return to full production may take weeks.\n\nIn Washington, Trump said he had approved the release of U.S. strategic petroleum reserves \u201cif needed\u201d to stabilize energy markets. The president said the final amount of the release, if any, would be \u201csufficient to keep the markets well-supplied.\u201d\n\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi dismissed the U.S. allegation of responsibility as \u201cblind and futile comments.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Americans adopted the \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 policy against Iran, which, due to its failure, is leaning toward \u2018maximum lies,\u2019\u201d Mousavi said in a statement.\n\nHouthi leader Muhammad al-Bukhaiti reiterated his group\u2019s claim of responsibility, telling The Associated Press it exploited \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d in Saudi air defenses to strike the targets. He did not elaborate.\n\nIran, meanwhile, kept up its own threats. Hajizadeh, the brigadier general who leads the country\u2019s aerospace program, said in an interview published across Iranian media Sunday that Revolutionary Guard forces were ready for a counterattack if America responded, naming the Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar and Al-Dhafra Air Base near Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates as immediate targets, as well as U.S. Navy ships in the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea.\n\n\u201cWherever they are, it only takes one spark and we hit their vessels, their air bases, their troops,\u201d he said in a video published online with English subtitles.\n\nTrump insisted that unspecified conditions must be met before he would sit down with the Iranian leader, apparently rejecting the comments of two top advisers.\n\n\u201cThe Fake News is saying that I am willing to meet with Iran, \u2018No Conditions.\u2019 That is an incorrect statement (as usual!).\u201d In fact, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last week that \u201cthe president has said that he is prepared to meet with no conditions.\u201d And Pompeo had told reporters days earlier that \u201cthe President has made clear he is happy to take a meeting with no preconditions.\u201d\n\nIran has said it was unwilling to meet with Trump while crushing sanctions the American leader imposed on Tehran after unilaterally withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear accord over a year ago remain in place.\n\n___\n\nGambrell reported from Dubai.
