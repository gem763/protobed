Naidoo claimed that the injuries were due to Daniel falling into a bathtub filled with hot water, and that he was found dead the next day.\n\nA forensic pathologist, however, testified that the wounds on Daniel were inflicted while he was still alive.\n\n'No compelling circumstances to deviate from prescribed sentences' - State Prosecutor\n\n\n\nPrior to the sentencing, State prosecutor Steven Rubin argued that the murder of Daniel, was \"out of the ordinary\" and that there was no need to deviate from the prescribed minimum sentence.\n\n\"We have a 3-year-old boy who is defenceless, we have two parents who are obligated to safeguard the needs of the child \u2013 both have failed to do this, and resulted in a horrific death.\n\n\"This is out of the ordinary, far beyond what we thought a human being was capable of,\" he said.\n\nWith respect to Cloete*, Rubin argued that she had failed to use any possible interventions provided to her.\n\nALSO READ: Baby Daniel's mom had opportunity to flee son's killer but failed to do so, court hears\n\n\"It's hypocritical for Accused No 1 to say the system failed her, because when social workers came to her home, she lied and told them that everything was fine,\" he added.\n\nRubin further questioned Cloete\u2019s conduct when she learnt of the abuse and still chose to stay in a relationship with Naidoo.\n\n\"For a mother to sit by while a man makes a child eat his faeces is a thing I cannot understand, on its own, my lord \u2013 this warrants imprisonment. she fails to give an explanation on the events leading up to\n\n\"Her degree of negligence led to the facilitation to allow Accused No 2 to commit the murder, had it not been for her actions \u2013 the murder would not have taken place,\" he further explained.\n\n*Maryke Cloete is not the woman's real name.
