They pinned their hopes on special counsel Robert Mueller and his report into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and possible obstruction of that investigation by Trump.\n\nWhen Mueller\u2019s report was not framed as clearly as the party would like, particularly around the 10 instances of potential obstruction, Democrats turned to the courts. Trump\u2019s tax returns and foreign emoluments have all been sought \u2013 and fought over \u2013 but little has emerged as the White House seeks to protect Trump\u2019s interests. A legal case cannot be presented clearly enough to upend Trump\u2019s \u201cI didn\u2019t do it\u201d and \u201cwitch hunt\u201d narrative.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

A legal decision is clear-cut. A political decision is messy and could have consequences at the ballot box if it goes badly. But the Ukraine allegations have changed the narrative.\n\nTrump is accused of pressuring the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in a July phone call to investigate the son of Joe Biden, the former vice-president and the frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic nomination.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Trump has also admitted delaying aid to Ukraine until recently, but said it was because European nations were not contributing to Kiev and he wants them to do more.\n\nThe allegations came after a whistleblower working in US intelligence filed a formal complaint reportedly related to the phone call. The acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, refused to release the details of the complaint.\n\nThe narrative is now simple enough that a flood of Democrats, including those facing tough re-election campaigns, joined the calls for a formal impeachment investigation. Pelosi has the political cover she needs \u2013 even if it is unlikely the Republican-led Senate will actually impeach.\n\nThe circumstances are similar to elements of the Mueller inquiry: potential assistance from a foreign power to help swing an election. But Democrats appear certain that this Ukraine scandal is clearer. In announcing the inquiry, Pelosi said: \u201cThe actions taken to date by the president have seriously violated the constitution... no one is above the law\u201d.\n\nNot much has changed empirically. Six house committees have been investigating various elements of Trump\u2019s conduct, with judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler clashing with Pelosi repeatedly over the last few weeks in his belief he was already running an impeachment investigation. But the difference now is that Democrats are all officially on the same page. With clarity of purpose can come clarity of message. Confusion will no longer reign.\n\nIf that clarity makes it through to the public hearings, we could see a change in popular opinion. In the same way that such hearings did in the Watergate scandal. With Democrats looking to battle Trump\u2019s social media and Fox News-aided clout, clear public hearings that dominate cable news schedules will help dramatically.\n\nSome Democrats will not be happy that Pelosi has said the other committees will make recommendations to the house judiciary committee, which has the authority to handle impeachment. Their reports could help form articles of impeachment brought against the president. Many Democrats want a laser focus on the Ukraine issue, with articles of impeachment not muddied by talk of Trump\u2019s tax returns or election finance violation allegations.\n\nTrump, as before, has called the whole thing a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and said he has done nothing wrong, trying to undercut Pelosi\u2019s announcement by releasing a partial transcript of the call with Zelensky and preparing to give the whistleblower complaint to congress.\n\nPrevarication and muddying the waters have been mainstays of the Trump playbook, but if Democrats move quickly they may be able to leave the White House unable to respond quickly enough. Trump has already backtracked over some elements revealed by the media while his lawyer Rudy Giuliani has contradicted himself within the same interview.\n\nPelosi has told Democrats to \u201cstrike while the iron is hot\u201d. The political risk is high, with Trump potentially able to gain traction if the Senate blocks impeachment, but Pelosi now sees the possible electoral gains. With a set narrative to put in front of the American people, the party can now act with a much clearer purpose.", "description": "The Democrats have been trying to tell the American people the story of Donald Trump\u2018s alleged corruption in the simplest way possible for more than two years.", "authors": ["Chris Stevenson"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/24/22/trump-pelosi-impeach-fade.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
