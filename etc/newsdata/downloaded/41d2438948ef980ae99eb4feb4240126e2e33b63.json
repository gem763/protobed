The couple can then go to court with all the correct paperwork.\n\nWe spoke to the professionals at diyorce.co.za for some insight into the process.\n\nWhat is a DIY divorce?\n\nA DIY divorce can only occur when both parties are interested in an uncontested divorce.\n\nThe major features a couple must agree on, for an amicable DIY divorce, are:\n\nWhether or not to get divorced\n\nSplit of assets\n\nMaintenance (if any) and the amount\n\nCustody and maintenance of minor children\n\nAs a result of this, there are restrictions around who would find a DIY divorce useful. If you can\u2019t agree on the terms of the divorce, then the DIY route isn\u2019t for you.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t in agreement about the key aspects of your divorce, then it is best to use mediation or the services of a divorce lawyer.\n\nIf through mediation you come to an agreement on the basics of your divorce, then it is possible to use continue on to a DIY divorce service.\n\nWhat does it cost?\n\nA DIY divorce is often a cheap, quick and easy way of getting a divorce. It is expensive to use a lawyer (from around R500 to as much as R3000 per hour) and it is hard to know how long the consultation process may take.\n\nCosts can easily mushroom and it can be hard to control, especially when you\u2019re doing something unfamiliar that you are emotionally invested in.\n\nIt is also possible to do your divorce entirely by yourself, but it is a complex process that needs to be perfect; you want the forms to be filled and submitted correctly so you don\u2019t have to extend the process of getting a divorce.\n\nSo it's often a much more cost effective method, with a basic, uncontested divorce costing under R1000 in some cases.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nIn order to make the process fast and affordable, templates are used to save expensive attorney time. The divorcing couple fills in an online form to capture all of their details and an attorney then looks through the information and will let them know if more information is required.\n\nOnce the attorney is happy that the documents are suitable for submission, they send them to the divorcing pair for review. Once everyone is happy, the attorney sends details through on how to submit the documents and explains the next steps.\n\nIn order to process your divorce, you\u2019ll need to take the documents to court and pay for the sheriff to serve them on your partner (this costs from R150). After the documents are served a court date can be set.\n\nIn an uncontested divorce only the plaintiff - the person who has started the process - needs to appear in court.\n\nFor those that need additional support, it is possible to add consultations with a lawyer, and even someone to go to court with you, for an extra fee.\n\nHow long will it take?\n\nHow long the process takes will vary depending on where you are in the country, but barring complications, the judge will make the agreement an \u2018Order of Court\u2019 in about a month.\n\nChat back:\n\nShare your story with us, and we could publish your mail.
