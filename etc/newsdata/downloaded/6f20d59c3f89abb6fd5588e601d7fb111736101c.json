The uncommon Treasury bond/dividend yield inversion is providing a level of support.\n\nU.S. Treasury yields have fallen in step with a global bond market rally as the trade war between China and the United States has kept recession fears on the horizon. Negative yields on government debt in countries such as Germany and Japan have also helped to depress those on U.S. Treasuries.\n\nWhile yields on intermediate-term Treasuries have been below the S&P 500's dividend yield for several months, the long-term 30-year yield <US30YT=RR> inverted at the end of August, the first time since March 2009, when stocks bottomed to mark the start of the current bull run.\n\n\"Whether it is the Federal Reserve signaling more cuts in the future or just in general this rally in the bond market, overall lower rates - you would think - put some sort of floor on the market as well,\" said Mark Kepner, equity trader at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.\n\n(Graphic: Inverted curve of 30-yr Treasury and S&P dividend yield - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/5726/5676/Pasted%20Image.jpg)\n\n\"It's pretty clear that the $17 trillion in negative-yielding bonds have been a black hole that sucks yields lower and lower in the U.S.,\" said Don Ellenberger, head of multi-sector strategies at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh.\n\nWith the dividend yield for the S&P 500 now above that of the 30-year, investors may look to stocks with high dividends for income.\n\nAfter dropping 1.8% in August, the S&P has gotten off to a fast start in September to completely erase that decline, in part due to gains in sectors such as energy <.SPNY> and consumer discretionary <.SPLRCD> that contain stocks with high dividend yields.\n\n\"There\u2019s a complete disconnect between the stock and bond markets,\" said Terri Spath, chief investment officer at Sierra Mutual Funds in Los Angeles.\n\n\"Some people are buying stocks for their dividends and bonds for capital appreciation.\"\n\n(Graphic: S&P 500 dividend yield vs US Treasuries - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/5732/5682/Pasted%20Image.jpg)\n\nWith each of the three major Wall Street indexes coming off monthly declines in August, investors may be tempted to look elsewhere in the short-term as September has been the worst- performing month for each since 1950, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac. The S&P has averaged a monthly decline of 0.5% and the Dow Industrials <.DJI> a 0.7% fall in the last month of the third quarter over that time.\n\nBut the higher dividend yields compared with government bonds could provide some incentive for stocks. Data from Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York, shows that there have been 31 instances since World War II when the S&P dividend yield exceeded that of the 10-year note. The benchmark index was higher a year later by an average of 22%, gaining in price 74% of the time.\n\nOver the same time period, Stovall found 20 occurrences of the yield on the S&P topping that of the 30-year Treasury. In the following year, the index had risen by an average of 12% while climbing 80% of the time.\n\n\"At some point an absolute thing kicks in and you go 'Well, where am I going to get my income from?' and the income- producing stocks, the yielding stocks are an attractive place to go,\" said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nOf S&P 500 components, 310 held a dividend yield above that of the 10-year note <US10YT=RR>, while 333 stocks' yields were above the 5-year <US5YT=RR> and 253 had yields higher than that of the 30-year bond through Wednesday's close.\n\nRecent inversions along the yield curve have triggered worries about an economic slowdown, as they have preceded each recession since 1970.\n\nStory continues", "description": "A decline in interest rates on long-term U.S. government bonds below the average stock dividend yield has received less attention than an inverted Treasury yield curve, but it could be a reason stocks find support after a bruising August.
