The government agency is particularly interested in whether Juul used deceptive marketing that targeted minors. It\u2019s also looking into Juul\u2019s hiring of influencers to sell its products. The FTC might seek monetary damages.\n\nIn a statement to the Journal, Juul said it used influencers in a \u201csmall, short-lived pilot\u201d that ended last year. The company paid less than $10,000 to fewer than 10 adults over the age of 30 who were current or former smokers, the spokesperson told the paper.\n\nThe investigation apparently has been in the works since last year, even before tobacco conglomerate Altria Group invested more than $12 billion to take a 35 percent stake in the startup. The first FTC letter requesting marketing information was sent to Juul in September. News of this investigation joins prior reports that the Food and Drug Administration along with several state attorneys general are also investigating Juul\u2019s marketing practices. The FDA asked Juul to turn over information that could explain why the devices are popular with young people, and then it inspected the company\u2019s office looking for related documents.\n\nMeanwhile, in an interview today, Juul Labs CEO Kevin Burns warned nonsmokers to never use its company\u2019s products. \u201cDon\u2019t vape,\u201d Burns said in an interview on CBS This Morning. \u201cDon\u2019t use Juul.\u201d He went on to say the product isn\u2019t designed for people who don\u2019t already have a \u201cpreexisting relationship\u201d with nicotine.\n\nThe US Surgeon General declared youth vaping an epidemic in 2018 and specifically noted the popularity of Juul in his advisory. A study published earlier this year found that people who started vaping in their teens were more likely to smoke cigarettes later in life.\n\nJuul is now working to backpedal out of the youth market that it says it never wanted in the first place. It\u2019s created a Bluetooth-enabled e-cigarette that requires users to submit government-issued photo identification to use the product. It\u2019s also pushing retailers to install an electronic age-verification system on their point-of-sale software. The company is willing to offer up to $100 million in incentives to get them to do so.", "description": "The FTC is reportedly investigating Juul Labs over its marketing practices that might have targeted minors through the use of influencers and other efforts.", "authors": ["Ashley Carman", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AUSusxzjNAbciFR3u2ebqjdbIQs=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11908455/acastro_180702_2708_juul_0002.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-29"}
