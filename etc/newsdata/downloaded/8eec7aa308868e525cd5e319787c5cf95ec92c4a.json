(NIRC/PA)\n\nAodhan Connolly (right), director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said it should come as \u201cno surprise\u201d amid the uncertainty of how the United Kingdom will leave the European Union.\n\n\u201cSeptember was another disappointing month for footfall in Northern Ireland with a further similar dip to that witnessed in August, very much reflective of what we have seen with consumer spending too over recent months,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe looming threat of a no deal disaster affecting consumer spending. It is no surprise that retail sales growth was in the red in the latest BRC figures.\n\n\u201cMany consumers held off from non-essential purchases, or shopped around for the bigger discounts, while the new autumn clothing ranges suffered from the warmer September weather.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing political gridlock surrounding Brexit is harming both consumers and retailers.\n\n\u201cClarity is needed over our future trading relationship with our closest neighbours, and it is vitally important that the UK does not leave the EU without a deal.\n\n\u201cThe fact Northern Ireland households have half of the discretionary income of Great British households means that we will feel any cost rises hardest.\u201d\n\nDiane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard, said footfall patterns were different in Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK.\n\n\u201cIn the UK as a whole, the vast majority of the footfall decline emanated from the last week of the month when the country was hit by exceptionally heavy rain,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHowever, in Northern Ireland the more severe drops were in the early weeks of the month when the weather was most favourable.\n\n\u201cTo provide some context, in the last week of the month in Northern Ireland footfall dropped by -3.5% versus a drop of -6.1% across the UK. This suggests that the decline in footfall is more structural, and not simply a function of adverse weather conditions.\u201d", "description": "Northern Ireland Retail Consortium chief Aodhan Connolly was speaking after it emerged footfall in the region dropped by 3.1% last month.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/00/wire-19669952-1571008068-962_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
