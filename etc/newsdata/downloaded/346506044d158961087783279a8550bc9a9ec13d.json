(David Gunn/CBC)\n\nHuebert says he expected the framework would look more like the federal government's defence policy, released in 2017, which includes clear commitments accompanied by spending promises.\n\nInstead, he says, this framework suggests the government doesn't have a clear plan for balancing its goals of environmental protection in the North with eliminating poverty and related social issues.\n\n\"I was hoping to see some type of discussion about what that means,\" he said. \"How do you actually do that? That's what I was hoping to see.\"\n\nA 'road map' to guide policy\n\nCrown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett calls the framework a \"road map\" that will guide how the federal government considers spending programs in the North.\n\n\"You begin with the policy and then you work toward implementation,\" Bennett said in an interview with CBC News. \"It's a matter of us now, as we move through each budget cycle of each government, having a road map for closing these gaps.\"\n\nIt's uncertain whether that will actually happen though, as next month's election could usher in a new government with different ideas.\n\nIqaluit Mayor Madeleine Redfern says she is cautiously optimistic about how effective the Arctic policy could prove to be. (Sara Frizzell/CBC)\n\nIqaluit Mayor Madeleine Redfern is cautiously optimistic about how effective the framework will be, with much of the \"hard work\" still to come in developing specific spending programs.\n\nShe previously criticized the time it's taken to develop the framework , but now that it's out she's happy it acknowledges the importance of including local, territorial and Indigenous governments in making decisions about the North.\n\n\"The framework speaks to the fact that we need to be more collaborative, more strategic. It's not a strategy per se, other than to say we need to actually be working together,\" she said.\n\nThough this acknowledgement alone won't immediately change things, it is \"needed and necessary\" to make the wholesale changes required in the North, Redfern said.\n\n\"There's been a lot of historical inefficiencies within government programs at all levels that have sometimes worked in conflict or contradict each other,\" she said.\n\nNow, the real question is whether this framework leads to more detailed proposals, Redfern said.\n\n\"There's a lot of really good stated goals in the framework. The hard work now is for us to begin to develop those strategies and see significant changes and improvements in our communities.\"", "description": "The federal government's new Arctic strategy lists health, infrastructure and economic development at the top, with calls to end poverty, eradicate hunger and eliminate homelessness, but it includes few details on how it plans to do all that.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5235129.1564781787!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/trudeau-north-20190801.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
