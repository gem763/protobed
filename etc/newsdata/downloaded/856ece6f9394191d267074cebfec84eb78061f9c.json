In fact, it is expensive as borrowers will have to pay a fee of 1.95 per cent of the total value of the property if the deal goes through.\n\nThere is also the 0.5 per cent interest on the loan per month until the mortgage is completed.\n\nThough this seems high this is actually on the lower end of the spectrum when it comes to this type of deal, with most bridging loans averaging between 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent per month.\n\nA spokesperson for the broker said: 'The term of the Habito Go loan is 12 months and the interest will therefore not exceed 6 per cent.\n\n'We will only be issuing Habito Go loans to customers we know have a high degree of confidence will get their main mortgage well within that timeframe - hence our focus on underwriting and getting valuations and comprehensive conveyancing underway in a timely and thorough manner right at the very start.'\n\nThe deal is not available on new-build properties.\n\nCould this save you money?\n\nAccording to HM Land Registry, cash purchases account for between 30 to 40 per cent of all housing transactions.\n\nWhile not an option available to everyone, buying a home this way has its advantages, the biggest being the speed with which you can close the deal.\n\nSellers like the certainty this gives them, and sometimes a cash buyer can secure a lower price on the home as a result.\n\nThe deal is available to first-time buyers applying for mortgages up to 85% loan-to-value\n\nHabito put us in touch with a homebuyer called Oliver Lambert who works for a private equity firm with a stake in Habito.\n\nHe says he recently managed to shave \u00a312,700 off the asking price of his new home by paying cash up front using Habito Go.\n\nThe North West London flat Oliver wanted was on the market for \u00a3595,000. Oliver was offered the opportunity to upgrade his HSBC mortgage application to an all-cash purchase using Habito Go.\n\nOliver then offered the seller \u00a3572,000 as a cash buyer, which the seller accepted. It is not clear whether the seller would have accepted that anyway, however.\n\nWithin five working days, a valuation on the property was carried out and a report was delivered. At the same time, solicitors were engaged and, simultaneously, Oliver's mortgage application was progressed, submitted and accepted with HSBC\n\nThe process took 26 days from start to completion, after this Oliver got the keys to his first home.\n\nOliver, who works for a private equity firm with a stake hold in Habito, recently bought a flat with Habito Go\n\nTaking the latest listing price, minus the accepted sale price, Oliver made an overall saving of \u00a323,000 or around 3.9 per cent.\n\nThis also allowed him to make a stamp duty saving, only paying \u00a318,850 on the \u00a3572,000 accepted cash offer instead of the \u00a319,750 he would have had to pay on the \u00a3595,000 listing price, saving him \u00a3900 in tax.\n\nAfter paying Habito Go their fee of 1.95 per cent, or \u00a311,154, Oliver saved a total of \u00a312,746 by managing to negotiate down the price.\n\nOn his current 1.79 per cent five year fix, over 25 years Oliver would also save an extra \u00a32,689 in interest.\n\nIn London's struggling housing market many buyers are accepting lower offers anyway, so there is a chance that Oliver could have secured a discount without the service.\n\nHis success story does not mean that this tactic will work every time, however.\n\nLondon is currently experiencing the steepest fall in house prices since the recession and Brexit uncertainty has hit the housing market in the capital the hardest of anywhere in the UK.\n\nElsewhere in the UK, particularly areas where the housing market is strong, sellers might not be in such a rush to sell, and may be less willing to accept lower offers.\n\nHowever, for those who believe they can negotiate the asking price of a home down to cover the fee, or those who simply don't mind paying the fee if it gives them a greater chance of securing the home more quickly, this deal might work.\n\nPersonal finance expert Andrew Hagger said: 'Habito Go has the potential to wipe out some of the major hassle factors encountered by first-time buyers.\n\n'The speeding up of the process and ability to negotiate a cash buyer discount could be highly beneficial and many borrowers could see some or all of the product fee costs negated due to a lower purchase price being achieved.\n\n'It also gives first-time buyers a greater chance of getting their number one choice of home - rather than having to settle for second, third or fourth choice.'", "description": "Habito claims that customers\u00a0can get their loan offer in as little as 24 hours, helping them to secure their property earlier and putting them in a stronger negotiating position on price.", "authors": ["Will Kirkman For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
