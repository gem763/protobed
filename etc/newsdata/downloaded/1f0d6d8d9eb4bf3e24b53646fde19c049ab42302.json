He wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh. After publicly suggesting that soldiers shoot migrants if they threw rocks, the president backed off when his staff told him that was illegal. But later in a meeting, aides recalled, he suggested that they shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down. That\u2019s not allowed either, they told him.\n\n\u201cThe president was frustrated and I think he took that moment to hit the reset button,\u201d said Thomas D. Homan, who had served as Mr. Trump\u2019s acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, recalling that week in March. \u201cThe president wanted it to be fixed quickly.\u2019\u2019", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Trump-Border-Wars.Html"], "top_image": ""}
