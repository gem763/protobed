Or perhaps, they were a little too passionate.\n\nRedditor Cvoony discovered that, when looking at the Bulls logo on their brother's sweater flipped upside down, the white-on-red image of a scowling bull turns into, uh. Well it looks like... you know. It's a robot having sex with a crab, OK?\n\nWhile the original image of the right-side-up, robot-on-crab action was posted to Reddit, it really gained some viral traction on Twitter when someone bothered to take the rotate tool and actually flip it. We're warning you, you really won't be able to unsee it.\n\nIf you turn the Chicago bulls logo upside down it\u2019s a robot having sex with a crab pic.twitter.com/KGfsqyr3Ml \u2014 Deniz Camp @ SDCC (@MDesaad) September 14, 2019\n\nSEE ALSO: The 'Is your child texting about' meme is back and still hilarious\n\nSome commenters suggested that the robot might be \"reading a book\" or \"studying the Bible.\" Yeah, right. Don't try to deny the intimate relationship between android and crustacean. Since the logo has been around for decades, these users are probably not the first to have their eyes opened.

I don't care that this has been with the team since 1966, because there's no excuse to still having graphics with terrible font choices and unfortunate Word Art-looking design in 2019. I'm looking at you, Marvel.\n\nTake a step back from Photoshop, rotate your image, flip it horizontally. You may just avoid being relentlessly clowned by sharp-eyed internet users several decades later. Or you might just really believe robot/crab love... if so, respect.", "description": "Graphic design was clearly not the passion of whoever designed the NBA's Chicago Bulls logo.
