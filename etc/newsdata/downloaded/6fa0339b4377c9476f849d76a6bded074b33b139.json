The former guerrillas also had killed six tourists, including two Americans, near the town of Victoria Falls.\n\nHowever, reports from churches, nongovernmental organizations and journalists showed that, over a period of four years, government forces imposed curfews, burned and bulldozed homes, and herded thousands of civilians into camps, where they were killed and buried in mass graves.\n\nLater research by the Catholic Church revealed high levels of torture and rape. Many victims, it said, were bayoneted to death or burned alive. The church report estimated that 20,000 people died in the action, but a ZAPU party spokesman said it was \u201cat least double that, or more.\u201d\n\nGregory Stanton, who served in the State Department and is now president of the activist group Genocide Watch, said in an interview that \u201call diplomatic and intelligence cables relating to the massacres should be released immediately,\u201d along with reasons \u201cwhy the U.S. took a decision to remain silent.\u201d\n\nIn Zimbabwe, the military campaign against the Matabele was known as \u201cGukurahundi\u201d \u2014 a rain that washes away husks after the corn has been reaped.\n\n\u201cThis was a genocide, plain and simple,\u201d said Mr. Stanton, who helped set up war crime courts in Rwanda and Cambodia. \u201cIt fits the definition used by the International Criminal Court at The Hague.\u201d\n\nWith the death of Mugabe, Mr. Stanton said, it is \u201ctime for America to clear its conscience.\u201d\n\nWilf Mbanga, editor of The Zimbabwean newspaper, said London and Washington had taken part in a \u201cconspiracy of silence that included all of Western Europe along with Australia and Canada.\u201d\n\nHe said the priority in the 1980s was to end apartheid and white minority rule in South Africa.\n\n\u201cI think many were reticent to criticize someone like Mugabe, who had fought against white rule in Zimbabwe,\u201d he said. \u201cThey wanted to show that democracy was working and South Africa had nothing to fear from handing power to the black majority.\u201d\n\nAmnesty International has joined calls for an inquiry into Gukurahundi and said the \u201cfailure to hold anyone accountable set a dangerous precedent.\u201d\n\nCritics say the Reagan administration and prominent black Americans at the time repeatedly passed on opportunities to expose and condemn Mugabe\u2019s campaign of violence and terror.\n\nRetired Sen. David Coltart is a former Zimbabwean minister for education. In the 1980s, his Bulawayo law firm represented some of the victims of Gukurahundi.\n\n\u201cIt has always been a mystery to me why Ronald Reagan, who was president at the time and who hosted Robert Mugabe at the White House, did not speak out,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo many people are still missing, lying in mass graves across Matabeleland. Nothing will bring them back, but answers could help start the healing. Britain and the United States owe them that,\u201d Mr. Coltart said.\n\nIn 1983, Newsweek\u2019s correspondent in Johannesburg, Holger Jensen, wrote one of the first stories exposing the Gukurahundi killings. Mr. Jensen later served as foreign editor of The Washington Times.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
