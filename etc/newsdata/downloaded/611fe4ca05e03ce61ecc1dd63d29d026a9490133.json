On Monday, The New York Times revealed that the press release was issued after Secretary of Commerce Wilbur L. Ross Jr. threatened to fire top NOAA employees following a tweet from its Birmingham office contradicting Trump.\n\n\u201c[T]he content of this press release is very concerning as it compromises the ability of NOAA to convey life-saving information necessary to avoid substantial and specific danger to public health and safety,\u201d McLean reportedly wrote in the email.\n\nHuffPost In a Sept. 1 tweet, Donald Trump falsely claimed Alabama could expect to be hit hard by Hurricane Dorian.\n\nTrump\u2019s incorrect tweet was widely panned by experts watching the storm\u2019s path, who noted that the state of Alabama was extremely unlikely to face devastating impact from the hurricane and criticized the president for inciting fear unnecessarily. A tweet sent from the official account of the National Weather Service\u2019s Birmingham office contradicted Trump\u2019s claim, saying Alabama would not see \u201cany impacts\u201d from Hurricane Dorian.\n\nAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east. #alwx \u2014 NWS Birmingham (@NWSBirmingham) September 1, 2019\n\nBut the NOAA, which oversees the National Weather Service, issued an unattributed public statement on agency letterhead condemning the NWS office in Birmingham. The statement, issued Friday, said the NWS tweet \u201cspoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.\u201d\n\nNOAA/HuffPost In an unattributed statement released by the NOAA Friday, the agency seemed to corroborate the president's incorrect claims about Hurricane Dorian and the risks it posed to the state of Alabama.\n\nMany people initially interpreted the statement as a government agency\u2019s act of fealty to Trump, who had spent the previous five days desperately arguing his initial claims were correct.\n\nIn a video posted online Sept. 4, Trump even motioned to a map he or someone in the White House had doctored with a Sharpie to imply Alabama had been in the storm\u2019s path as he claimed.\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images President Donald Trump during an Oval Office briefing on the status of Hurricane Dorian, in Washington, D.C.\n\nAs the NOAA\u2019s chief scientist, McLean reportedly told staffers a specific danger arises \u201cif the public cannot trust our information, or we debase our forecaster\u2019s warnings and products.\u201d\n\nThis has been updated with more information about the Friday NOAA statement.", "description": "The agency, which oversees the National Weather Service, issued a statement Friday supporting the president's false claims about the path of Hurricane Do...", "authors": ["Associate Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d767a6f230000e903512945.jpeg?cache=nlctnmaig5&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
