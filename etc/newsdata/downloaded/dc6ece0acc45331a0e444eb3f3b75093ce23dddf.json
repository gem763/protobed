He said communication with the area was difficult because of the isolated location.\n\nPakistani forces were again firing mortars down on villages inside Afghanistan after fighting resumed Monday morning, said General Mohammad Ayub Hussainkhail, an Afghan commander for forces on the eastern border.\n\n\"Dozens of local people have displaced from the area,\" he said, adding that reinforcements had arrived in the Do Kalam area of Nari district.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Pakistan.\n\nBorder fences\n\nThe two countries often trade accusations that the other side is firing across the border, which runs for 2,400km (1,490 miles), much of it through mountainous terrain.\n\nThe Taliban and other armed groups operate on both sides of the porous line.\n\n191007044244901\n\nPakistani troops are currently building border fences in response to ongoing complaints by Afghanistan over cross-border movement, particularly by fighters.\n\nBut Kabul remains deeply suspicious of Pakistan's motives. Islamabad had backed the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, and until recently seemed unable or unwilling to go after fighter leaders taking refuge inside its borders.\n\nAfghanistan also disputes the exact path of the border, known as the Durand Line, which was drawn by the British in 1893 to mark the edge of their colonial possessions.", "description": "The two countries often trade accusations that each side is firing across the border.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/28/1730a4f7c62a49508a117f69f6dae07d_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
