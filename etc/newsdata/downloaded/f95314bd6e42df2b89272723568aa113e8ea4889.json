Lorenzo Reyes delivers this weeks power rankings and biggest risers and fallers. USA TODAY\n\nAfter he was taken off of the field on a backboard Sunday, Denver Broncos cornerback DeVante Bausby said he was \u201cparalyzed\u201d for half an hour and couldn\u2019t move before gaining his mobility.\n\n\u201cI was awake the whole time,\u201d Bausby told reporters Tuesday. \u201cI was never unconscious. I just couldn\u2019t move. But I was still talking and everything. The doctor said I\u2019d be fine and I just kind of trusted him. After 30 minutes, I was able to wiggle my toes and after a couple of hours regain full mobility, so I was straight. I was fine.\u201d\n\nBausby collided with Broncos teammate and linebacker Alexander Johnson during Sunday\u2019s 20-13 victory against the Los Angeles Chargers shortly after he tackled running back Austin Ekeler early in the second quarter.\n\nPlay stopped and teammates quickly called on Denver\u2019s medical staff to tend to Bausby. The medical trainers removed Bausby\u2019s facemask and secured him to a backboard before taking him off the field and transporting him to the Los Angeles Trauma Center.\n\nNFL power rankings: New teams enter top 10 following losses by Cowboys, Chargers\n\nMore: Buccaneers OL Alex Cappa breaks arm vs. Saints, plays through rest of game\n\nBausby said he underwent further testing, scans, and X-rays.\n\n\u201cThey said I was paralyzed for the first 30 minutes,\u201d Bausby said.\n\nBroncos coach Vic Fangio characterized the injury as \u201csomething with the spinal area\u201d saying he didn\u2019t know the technical term for it, but said it was had to do with \u201ccompression.\u201d He added that he didn\u2019t think it would need \u201cdrastic treatment\u201d to heal but instead would simply require time.\n\n\u201c \u2018Baus\u2019 is doing good,\u201d Fangio said Monday. \u201cNo timetable on his return yet, but he\u2019ll definitely miss some time. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll be the entire rest of the season or not, (with) these things the first few days and week will kind of tell the story.\u201d\n\nBausby, 26, is in his third season in the league after stints with the Bears and the Eagles. He had emerged as a starter over Denver\u2019s last two games and had totaled 13 tackles and three passes defended.\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re just going to take it real slow and gain my strength back,\u201d Bausby said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a timetable, but hopefully pretty soon. My plan is to come back and play, though.\u201d", "description": "After suffering a scary collision Sunday against the Chargers, Broncos CB DeVante Bausby said he was paralyzed for 30 minutes.", "authors": ["Lorenzo Reyes", "Published P.M.
