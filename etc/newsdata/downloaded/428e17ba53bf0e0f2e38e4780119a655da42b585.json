(Matt Rourke/AP)\n\nALLENTOWN, Pa. \u2014 About 200 miles outside Washington, the impeachment inquiry into President Trump is something Rep. Susan Wild\u2019s constituents are aware of \u2014 but when they get the chance to talk to the Democratic congresswoman, they have other things on their minds.\n\n\u201cGuns. That\u2019s part of the reason I\u2019m here,\u201d said Ian Tauber, heading into the Wednesday town hall here with Wild. \u201cI mean, I get impeachment and I support it at this point, but I\u2019d like to see continued progress in other areas.\"\n\n\u201cWe have climate change, we have prescription drugs,\u201d said Robert Martin at the town hall, referring to the subjects he\u2019d rather be talking about.\n\n\u201cI'm very concerned about climate change,\u201d said Deb Martin.\n\nIn fact, of more than two dozen questions Wild fielded in the crowded town hall at Muhlenberg College, only two were about impeachment. That\u2019s notable, given that Wild is a moderate Democrat who reluctantly supported an impeachment inquiry last week, acknowledging it might cost her politically. She represents a \u201cpurple\u201d political district, Pennsylvania\u2019s 7th, which has Democratic leanings but narrowly voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential race.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t come to Congress to pursue an impeachment inquiry,\u201d she told the crowd, which was largely supportive of her decision to back one. \u201cIt was the last thing in the world I wanted. I said on the campaign trail it would be a two-year distraction, and I don\u2019t want to see something that would take away from the work we need to do for working Americans. And here we are.\u201d\n\nWild says the Trump administration left her no choice. She said last week that if the administration didn\u2019t release the whistleblower complaint to Congress as it was supposed to, she\u2019d support an inquiry. Then it was released, along with a rough transcript of Trump\u2019s July call with the newly elected Ukrainian president, when Trump appears to pressure him to get dirt on his political opponent.\n\nThe call, she told reporters Wednesday before the town hall, \"pretty clearly was an attempt to use the power of his office to try to gain a political advantage. And the surrounding facts remain to be seen.\u201d\n\nNow, Wild is more in line with the leaders of the impeachment inquiry than the last few holdouts within the Democratic caucus. The leaders have warned the Trump administration that any efforts to withhold documents would be considered an obstruction of their impeachment probe \u2014 and an impeachable offense in its own right. Wild agrees. \u201cIf the administration stonewalls us and refuses to produce things, I would consider that to be an obstruction of justice, and yes, I believe that would constitute additional grounds [for impeachment],\" she said.\n\nThe crowd gathered to talk to her Wednesday didn\u2019t seem to mind her stance. When someone cited polls that show a majority of Americans don\u2019t support impeachment, a handful of people in the back yelled \u201cNooooo!\u201d and \u201cWe do!\u201d The town hall was being held in the most liberal part of her district, but Wild said she had spent the rest of the week traveling throughout the entire district, including its more rural parts, and impeachment was just not on people\u2019s minds.\n\n\u201cSo far in the district, I\u2019ve heard absolutely nothing,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cCrickets.\u201d\n\nPeople want to talk about public education, climate change, prescription drug costs and manufacturing. Those were the bulk of questions addressed to her on Wednesday. Even Ken Thompson, who didn\u2019t vote for her and opposes impeachment, didn\u2019t ask about it when he got his turn at the microphone. He wanted to make a point about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails.\n\nFor Wild, that could be considered good news. She took a politically risky move, and so far it\u2019s not blowing up in her face.\n\nBut it also means that the issues her constituents care about risk getting put on the back burner in the House. And that may be the most dangerous thing of all about the impeachment inquiry for her: An already difficult job to legislate in a divided government just got even harder.", "description": "In a town hall in Pennsylvania, Rep.
