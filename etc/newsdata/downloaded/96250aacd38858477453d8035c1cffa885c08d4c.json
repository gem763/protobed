I'm doing well. Rolling along. Eating well.\"\n\nWhile James confessed: \"Her boobs are massive. I love it.\"\n\nOla revealed that James has been helping out loads and doing a lot of extra housework.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nHe admitted: \"I'm quite a softie. I'm very protective. I'm always making sure she's careful when she's walking up the stairs and all the housework I'm doing.\"\n\nAt the weekend, James voiced his disappointment that Kevin Clifton was drafted in to replace the injured Neil Jones.\n\nHe thinks that Gorka Marquez, who missed out on a celeb partner this year, should have got the call up.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nJames said: \"I've got nothing against Kevin. But Kevin was on the show. He had his celebrity partner.\n\n\"Gorka hadn't. He was on the show last year. It wasn't his choice. It would have been a nice nod to Gorka for a week.\n\n\"Kevin's been there and done it. For Gorka it would have been a nice thing.\"\n\nJames isn't shy when having his say on Strictly, but believes the judges actually got the decision right this weekend.\n\n(Image: David Fisher/REX)\n\nCatherine Tyldesley was controversially booted out with pro partner Johannes Radebe - sparking outrage from a large section of viewers.\n\nJames, who admitted he is often \"very controversial\", claimed the public have no case to be angry.\n\nHe said: \"I'll call BS. On paper Catherine has been better on the show. They're only there to judge the dance off. That's a fact.\n\n\"When Dev [Griffin] went out that for me was more controversial because he should have gone home. For me they've got it right.\"\n\nThe Daily Mirror Pride of Britain Awards, in partnership with TSB, will broadcast on ITV on 5th November at 8pm .\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
