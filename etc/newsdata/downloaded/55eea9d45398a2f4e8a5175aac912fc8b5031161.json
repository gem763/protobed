Depressed business conditions, meanwhile, mean that corporate income tax has also disappointed, while VAT revenues are lower than the same period last year.\n\n\"Tax shortfalls have occurred in spite of the implementation of additional tax hikes, including the 1% VAT increase and an increase in taxes for the top tax bracket,\" wrote Momentum. \"There is a growing concern that the country has approached its limit on advancing tax revenue collections through further tax increases for taxpayers.\"\n\nEarlier in October SARS head Edward Kieswetter told Bloomberg that it is \"going to be hard\" to reach the estimated R1.58trn revenue that Treasury forecast.\n\nKieswetter, appointed as permanent head of the revenue collection agency in March, said part of the difficulty in meeting targets was that resources allocated to SARS have been \"significantly constrained, for no other reason that there just is no money.\"\n\n\u201cUnless we have the resources to rebuild the capability, the project of restoring SARS is at risk,\u201d he said.", "description": "Ahead of the mini budget later this month, Momentum says the SA Revenue Service faces shortfalls in personal income tax, corporate income tax and VAT.", "authors": ["Jan Cronje"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9465/5021e2997c5d477c82ee9c61259a9f19.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
