(Next up is CNN\u2019s LGBTQ Town Hall next month, proving the Democrats are fatally preoccupied with fringe concerns that might get them plaudits on Twitter but won\u2019t win over a single voter from Donald Trump.)\n\n\u201cYou and other members of the Sunrise Movement are going to be the ones who are going to receive the credit for this change that we\u2019re talking about today,\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke gushed under cross-examination by the Sunrise youngsters.\n\nJulian Castro effusively praised Sunrise, too, even though its aggressive questioning was designed to cement the candidates into ever more extreme positions.\n\nPoor Kamala Harris was visibly uncomfortable as she waved her arms around desperately as the answers were extracted.\n\n\u201cWill you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking your first day in office, adding the United States to the list of countries who have banned this devastating practice?\u201d she was asked.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question I\u2019m in favor of banning fracking, so yes,\u201d Harris replied.\n\nCNN\u2019s Erin Burnett asked Harris if she would \u201creduce red meat specifically\u201d if she were president.\n\n\u201cYes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I would,\u201d said Harris, dancing around the stage like a cat on a hot tin roof.\n\n\u201cPlastic straws?\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think we should, yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cOffshore drilling\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nHer voice barely above a whisper at the end, you could almost see her political future flash before her eyes.\n\nBanning everything is not a recipe for electoral success.\n\nPete Buttigieg tried to explain sacrifice was necessary because the climate \u201ccrisis\u201d is \u201con par with winning World War II \u2026 perhaps even more challenging than that.\u201d\n\nAmerica\u2019s prosperity is built on the cheap, abundant fossil fuel under our feet and offshore, and yet green zealots want to force us into an energy crisis by banning coal, fracking, offshore gas exploration, even the export of fossil fuels: \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d said Cory Booker.\n\nElizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang want to impose a carbon tax on all of us \u2014 effectively a tax on electricity, which will send energy bills through the roof.\n\nSanders vowed to spend a staggering $16 trillion on the \u201cemergency\u201d and force the country onto 100 percent renewable energy for electricity and transport by 2030. He says the money will magically materialize from gutting the defense budget and taxing all the rich people he imagines will sit around like fat geese waiting to be plucked.\n\nOf course, there was no acknowledgment from candidates that even if every American switched off the lights and went back to living in caves China will merrily keep building coal-fired power plants and emitting twice as much carbon dioxide as the United States.\n\nThey have bought the unscientific fantasy that you can replace base-load fossil fuel or nuclear power with unreliable solar and wind.\n\nThey also seem to have bought the Greta Thunberg apocalypse myth that the planet will end in 11 years unless we somehow stop climate change by ending the use of fossil fuels.\n\nBut if you really believed the end is nigh, then the obvious solution would be to switch to nuclear. If you really thought carbon dioxide was killing the planet you would embrace this most reliable, zero-emissions energy source, which causes less environmental degradation than renewables. For instance, a solar farm in California reportedly requires 450 times more land to produce the same amount of energy as a nuclear plant.\n\nBut Warren and Sanders are implacably opposed to nuclear.\n\nFor all the Democrats, the big idea is to spite Donald Trump by signing back onto the Paris climate accord.\n\nBut America should be on bended knee in gratitude that Trump bailed out of the latest treaty from the UN\u2019s Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nThe preamble to the Paris Agreement alone tells you this is at heart a social-engineering project, aimed at remaking the capitalist economies of the West.\n\nSignatories must \u201crespect, promote and consider their respective obligations on human rights, the right to health, the rights of indigenous peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons with disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the right to development, as well as gender equality, empowerment of women and intergenerational equity.\u201d\n\nNow you see why Julian Castro is talking \u201cenvironmental racism?\u201d\n\nLike the IPCC, the Democrats have given up the pretense that climate alarmism has anything to do with the actual \u201cenvironment,\u201d as most Americans would understand that word: clean air and water.\n\nThat should be warning enough about their real motives.\n\nMarriage is \u2018broke\u2019n for modern gals\n\nIf the future is female, something has to be done about the broke men no one wants to marry.\n\nAs women start to outstrip men in the educational and career stakes, they\u2019re finding the store of \u201ceconomically attractive\u201d males has dried up, according to a study in the Journal of Family and Marriage.\n\nThey might have reached the pinnacle of modern feminist success, but it seems women still prefer the old-fashioned notion of \u201cmarrying up.\u201d\n\nEither they lower their expectations or resign themselves to loneliness. A society without marriage is a bleak prospect indeed.\n\nAmerican $aints\n\nAfter 10:15 Mass at St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral yesterday, Timothy Cardinal Dolan was delighted to receive a $5,000 check for his Notre Dame restoration fund from Joe Heenan and his sons Michael and Ryan, who had driven from Philadelphia to deliver the donation in person.\n\nThe money, donated by the 248-year-old Irish society of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick\u2019s, where Heenan is resident historian, is just the latest wallet-loosening by generous Americans to help restore the 12th century Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, which was ravaged by fire in April.\n\nSo far, $14 million has flowed into the cardinal\u2019s \u201cSt. Patricks to Notre Dame\u201d fund and he is looking forward to meeting an emissary from Notre Dame who is visiting New York this week to say thank you.", "description": "Joe Biden\u2019s bleeding eye at the Democrats\u2019 marathon \u201cclimate crisis\u201d town hall on CNN last week is as good an omen as any of the political curse of eco-catastrophism.", "authors": ["Miranda Devine", "September"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/bernie-warren.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
