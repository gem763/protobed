I hope... I am going to spend five years more here at least.\n\n\u201cFootball is a game to enjoy and when you don\u2019t win it is difficult to enjoy but you can\u2019t create a drama,\u201d Pochettino added. \u201cAnd we are not going to create a drama.\u201d\n\nWhile the result against Bayern led defender Jan Vertonghen to say he felt \u201cashamed\u201d, Pochettino said the scoreline should not detract from their first-half display.\n\nAsked if it was his low point at Tottenham, Pochettino said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe so. In terms of the result of course, the score, but we played really bad games in more than five years here with a different result.\u201d\n\nTottenham have won only two of their last nine games in all competitions and sit sixth in the league, 10 points behind leaders Liverpool.\n\n\u201cWe need to move on and we need to be ready,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cWe need to try to show the best quality and the best performance, the competition doesn\u2019t wait for you.\n\n\u201cYou cannot go home and cry and spend three days closed in your room, you need to move on quick, that is the key. You stick with your ideas and be more stronger than before.\u201d\n\nPochettino played down concerns about midfielder Dele Alli\u2019s loss of form which has cost him his place in the England squad.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong with Dele,\u201d he said. \u201cFootball is about form and sometimes you have a not so good period.\n\n\u201cDele only needs time to recover his best performance and we will help him and provide the tools and the platform.\n\n\u201cNow he is in a tough period but we need him because he is a very important player for us.\u201d\n\nTottenham are without right back Serge Aurier through suspension for the trip to Brighton. Midfielder Moussa Sissoko looks likely to slot in there for the 1130 GMT kickoff.", "description": "Tottenham Hotspur coach Mauricio Pochettino dismissed speculation about his future at the club on Friday and said he hoped to spend many more years in North London.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437030760&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930ZC", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
