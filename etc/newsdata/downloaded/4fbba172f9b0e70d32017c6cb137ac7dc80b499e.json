But when Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tried to bring up the subject during Thursday\u2019s Democratic debate, in response to a question about education, a moderator cut her off.\n\n\u201cStart with our babies by providing universal child care for every baby age 0 to 5, universal pre-K for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old in this country,\u201d Warren said, just getting on a roll when ABC moderator Linsey Davis interrupted. \u201cThank you, senator,\u201d Davis said.\n\nDavis was just following the rules: Warren\u2019s time for the response had lapsed. But the moment was a perfect metaphor for the attention child care and other work-family issues have gotten in these debates \u2015 or, more accurately, the attention they have not gotten in these debates.\n\nThat seems like a problem.\n\nThe U.S. is an extreme outlier when it comes to the support it gives to working parents. In the rest of the developed world, national governments make sure parents of newborns get paid time off and, then, if they return to work, that they have access to affordable, quality child care. Adults caring for relatives, including the elderly, also get support.\n\nThe lack of a similar safety net here in the U.S. is as noteworthy as the lack of a truly universal health care system. And yet it hasn\u2019t gotten nearly the same attention from politicians until very recently \u2015 in 2016, when Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton put forth a plan that would have guaranteed more affordable child care to all Americans, and now in 2020, when several Democratic candidates have staked out similarly ambitious positions.\n\nConspicuous among them is Warren. She has become famous for her policy agenda but the very first spending program she outlined, back in February, was her child care proposal, which envisioned raising the famously low quality standards of child care and then making sure every working parent could afford it.\n\nHeidi Gutman via Getty Images Presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tried to bring up child care during Thursday night's Democratic debate, but was cut off.\n\nNo family would have to pay more than 7% of its income on child care, under Warren\u2019s plan, and for families with incomes of less than twice the poverty line, or an annual income of about $50,000 in households of four, child care would be free.\n\nThat kind of program would represent a massive, revolutionary investment of government money into early childhood. Internal estimates suggested the net cost, taking into account its projected economic benefits, would be $700 billion over 10 years. The new investment would represent something like a fourfold increase in what the federal government spends on child care today, or maybe even more depending on how you do the math.\n\nAnd Warren isn\u2019t the only one out there talking about these issues.\n\nFormer San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro has proposed a national pre-kindergarten program that would look like the one he brought to his city and that experts have hailed as a model. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has done the same, citing the city\u2019s popular new pre-K program that is arguably his signature accomplishment.\n\nDe Blasio wasn\u2019t on the stage Thursday night, but Castro was and, tellingly, he mentioned early childhood programs on his own \u2015 during his prepared opening remarks. Former Vice President Joe Biden got in a plug for pre-K during a question about education, while Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) brought up both child care and paid leave, causes he\u2019s championed for years.\n\n\u201cI believe that the United States should not be the only major country on earth not to provide paid family and medical leave,\u201d he said.\n\nThe moderators didn\u2019t pick up on any of this, asking not a single question related to either child care or paid leave. And it\u2019s been that way for three debates now, according to Vicky Shabo, a senior fellow at think tank New America who focuses on work-family policy.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t like these are fringe issues,\u201d Shabo told HuffPost. \u201cVirtually every working person will need time away from their job at some point to care for a new child or deal with a serious personal or family health issue ... Nearly every working parent is challenged to find quality, affordable child care, and many child care providers cannot themselves afford child care or basic living expenses for their own families because their pay is so low.\u201d\n\nThat last part is especially important. Some of the child care proposals envision raising the pay of providers, not simply to improve conditions for kids but to boost incomes of adults who are almost criminally underpaid. The typical worker at a child care center makes less than $11 an hour, as of 2017, which is roughly what parking lot attendants get.\n\nThe lack of child care and paid leave has additional economic consequences. With better early childhood programs, low-income kids are more likely to succeed academically and be more successful in the workplace once they become adults, according to a large body of research.\n\nAnd because the responsibility for caregiving falls disproportionately on women, the inability to find affordable child care \u2015 or get paid time off from work \u2015 ends up holding back the professional advancement of many, reducing not just their family incomes but also economic growth.\n\nThere\u2019s been a steady, if underappreciated, progression of states taking action on their own. Connecticut and Oregon both enacted paid leave laws this year. In California, the new budget Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom just signed made its pioneering paid leave law even more generous and dumped a bunch of new money into child care.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the blue states, by the way. Pre-K is up and running in Georgia, Oklahoma and Tennessee, and has support of Republican leaders in those states.\n\nAll of which is to say, early childhood and work-family issues seem ripe for more discussion. And although there\u2019s only so many issues the debates can cover, especially with so many candidates, it\u2019s hard not to think their near-total absence from conversation so far has at least something to do with the fact that, historically, these have been \u201cwomen\u2019s\u201d issues that the predominantly male political establishment has not taken seriously.\n\nAnother factor may be the relative unity among Democrats on the need for the federal government to take a much bigger role in supporting working parents and caregivers. Debates inevitably focus on the most contentious issues and, so far, there are no signs of the kinds of disagreements that exist over health care, for example. But it\u2019s not as if the Democratic proposals are devoid of controversial elements that might matter to voters and that would be worth probing now, early in the campaign.\n\nIs a plan to subsidize child care fair to at-home parents? Should the proposals be even more generous? What about evidence that big child care initiatives in other countries left some kids worse off? Can businesses handle the logistical and financial complications of more workers taking time off? Could stronger support for caregiving actually set back the cause of gender equality, by making it more financially viable for women to stay out of the workforce?\n\nThe more thoughtful proponents of bigger investments in child care and paid leave have answers to these questions. Maybe it\u2019s time debate moderators started asking for them.", "description": "It's a huge issue for working parents and the candidates keep trying to bring it up.", "authors": ["Senior National Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7b9ca43b00002a74d2644f.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
