But sans red-herring singles \u201cMe!\u201d and \u201cYou Need to Calm Down,\u201d Lover has provided a rare opportunity for Taylor Swift to \u2026 chill. Her NPR Tiny Desk Concert exemplifies that by just being the girl and the guitar-string scars on her hands. \u201cYou guys ever have costume changes at Tiny Desk?\u201d she jokes while taking off her jacket. On top of Lover\u2019s title track, the pop star sang \u201cThe Man,\u201d \u201cDeath by a Thousand Cuts,\u201d and Red\u2019s fifth track, \u201cAll Too Well.\u201d (The last two being breakup songs that she\u2019s very happy she doesn\u2019t relate to anymore.) \u201cThere\u2019s one song that I\u2019m particularly proud of because when the Red album came out there was this one song on the album and I\u2019m like \u2018I\u2019m the only one who likes this song this much, but it\u2019s only because it happened to me and it\u2019s personal. No one is going to like \u201cAll Too Well\u201d as much,\u2019\u201d she recalls, adding that it\u2019s crazy how \u201cAll Too Well\u201d usually makes No. 1 on any Taylor Swift song ranking. It\u2019s No. 2 on Vulture\u2019s, but that\u2019s only because \u201cYou Belong With Me\u201d is a bop.\n\nRelated", "description": "Taylor Swift gets personal on her very first NPR Tiny Desk Concert.
