It\u2019s becoming more and more difficult,\u201d he said.\n\nThe collapse of the agency has also affected thousands of employees.\n\nIn a statement, Thomas Cook Chief Executive Peter Fankhauser, apologized to customers and employees.\n\n\u201cI would like to apologize to our millions of customers, and thousands of employees, suppliers and partners who have supported us for many years. Despite huge uncertainty over recent weeks, our teams continued to put customers first, showing why Thomas Cook is one of the best-loved brands in travel,\u201d he said. \u201cThis marks a deeply sad day for the company which pioneered package holidays and made travel possible for millions of people around the world.\u201d\n\nHere is what to know about Thomas Cook:\n\nWhy did Thomas Cook collapse?\n\nFaced with Brexit, poor mergers and increased competition, the 178-year-old company finally fell to its demise on Monday.\n\nKey to its downfall is Thomas Cook\u2019s merger with MyTravel, a U.K.-based package travel company, in 2007. What had initially started out with hope, ended up in disaster. Thomas Cook ended up with huge debts that proved impossible to manage as, MyTravel had only made a profit once since 2001. The impact of the merger came to a head in May after Thomas Cook reported a record loss of \u00a31.5 billion ($1.85 billion) and a steep drop in summer sales.\n\nThomas Cook also faced new competition from lower cost rival Jet2Holidays, putting the company\u2019s profits under fresh pressure. Previously, the market had been split between Thomas Cook and Tui. Within two months, Thomas Cook had to issue two profit warnings.\n\nBrexit didn\u2019t help their situation either\u2014the original March 29, 2019 Brexit deadline meant that people were nervous about booking holidays.\n\nIn August this year, there was hope that Thomas Cook could break free from disaster after it agreed to a $1.1 billion rescue deal with Fosun, a China-based investment company, Thomas Cook\u2019s biggest shareholder and its debtholders.\n\nHowever, as of Monday, Thomas Cook collapsed into liquidation after talks with shareholders, lenders and the U.K. government failed to come up with a rescue plan after the company\u2019s banks demanded a further $250 million.", "description": "Hundreds of thousands of passengers were left stranded on Monday following Thomas Cook collapse", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XxPMYhdk1fRe0RBYbT1nYQ--~B/aD0xODMzO3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/39b9b3d65f1f3361adea5ba2f9810ead", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
