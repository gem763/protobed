REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo\n\nThe group will overhaul its European store estate using data to give insight into what customers want in each location, with 40% of the stores transformed by the end of 2021, Read said.\n\nCustomer service offered by Apple and Amazon had changed expectations, and Vodafone hopes to improve its services faster than former incumbent rivals like BT, Deutsche Telekom and Telefonica with targeted and personalised marketing, he said.\n\n\u201cIf you believe that 40% of your transactions are going to be digital, then how does that impact why someone goes to a store. The journeys and the purpose of the store changes,\u201d Read told reporters at a briefing in Duesseldorf, Germany.\n\n\u201c(That) means that we will have more \u2018experience\u2019 stores, less standard format stores (and) more convenience, and kiosk and click-to-collect stores.\u201d\n\nRead said the group would use new technology such as its AI-powered chatbot to help customers buy products and services in just three clicks.\n\nVodafone, the world\u2019s second largest mobile operator, however, plans to continue store openings in of Britain.\n\nIn September, it announced plans to open 24 new franchise stores in Britain this year, and it is examining the possibility of opening 50 more stores in 2020 in conjunction with new online services.\n\nAlthough Britain is Vodafone\u2019s home market, it is not in the vanguard of Read\u2019s plan to create a \u201cgigabit\u201d company centred on 5G mobile, ultrafast cable and fibre broadband, and a European pay-TV platform second only to Comcast\u2019s Sky in customer numbers.\n\nGermany will be the engine of growth, Read said, with growth driven by the acquisition of Unitymedia, the largest cable network in the $22 billion (18 billion pounds) deal to buy Liberty Global assets, which was completed in July.\n\n\u201cI definitely think (Germany\u2019s) the heart of the company, because it\u2019s 40% of the free cash flow,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we have a fantastic asset position in that marketplace.\u201d\n\nHe said by the 2022 financial year Vodafone\u2019s German broadband network, comprising cable and fibre, would include 25 million premises against 8 million for other fibre providers.\n\n\u201cWe have a structural advantage that cannot be closed in any short-time horizon, which is why we really want to drive penetration,\u201d he said.\n\nUnitymedia was being integrated faster than any other previous acquisition, he said, with better execution, despite its significantly larger size.\n\n\u201cWe feel very confident on the cost, the capex and the revenue synergies,\u201d he said.\n\nVodafone is aiming to cut costs by 1.2 billion pounds by its 2021 financial year.", "description": "Vodafone will shut 15% of its 7,700 stores in Europe and upgrade some of the remaining outlets as customers buy more online and change their expectations of in-store shopping, chief executive Nick Read said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Paul Sandle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438526683&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF971E1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
