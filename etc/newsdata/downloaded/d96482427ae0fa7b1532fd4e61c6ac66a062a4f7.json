Yes, there is some occasionally!\n\nHong Kong's leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, finally on Wednesday withdrew officially a detested proposed law that would have allowed the rendition of suspects into China's rigged legal system.\n\nThis meets the first of five demands made by the protestors who have taken to the streets for more than three months now. It's a no-brainer of a decision that somehow took a lot of thought.\n\nThe markets love it. Hong Kong stocks jumped 3.9% on Wednesday, bringing them back into the black for the year. The benchmark Hang Seng index's paltry 2.6% gain in 2019 is starkly removed from China's strong 29.1% showing so far this year, for stocks in Shanghai and Shenzhen.\n\nHong Kong's property developers, so obviously affected by what goes on in the city, were the top gainers. Wharf Real Estate (WARFY) climbed 12.1%, New World Development (NDVLY) rose 10.1% and Sun Hung Kai Properties (SUHJY) advanced 9.8%.\n\nCathay Pacific (CPCAY) , the city's flagship airline, saw its stock surge 7.2%. Cathay has been at the center of a storm over its employees. China's aviation authority instructed the airline to bar any staff who took part in protests or \"overly radical activities\" from flying over its airspace.\n\nThe city's beleaguered subway system, the MTR Corp. (MTCPY) , rose 6.4%. The protests have become running battles in its halls, and may now ease. The MTR has also come under attack literally and figuratively, from protesters angry that it has delayed trains so police can board them to make arrests, or shuttered stations where demonstrators were returning home. One MTR station became site of a violent triad attack.\n\nBanks were also on the up on Wednesday, Hang Seng Bank (HSNGY) ahead 6.9% at the close. Protesters have tried to target the banking system, unsuccessfully, but consumer morale has been low and retailers are having a torrid time.\n\nLam, the Hong Kong leader, had already declared that the Fugitive Offenders Bill was \"dead.\" But this seemed like a piece of legalese to many, raising the question of why she wouldn't formally strike the potential law from the books.\n\nA Reuters story revealed on Friday that the Lam administration had in fact presented exactly such a withdrawal to the Beijing government, as a way of defusing the situation in Hong Kong - only to be told that under no circumstances could it do so.\n\nThe Hong Kong administration also suggested that it would be feasible to meet the second of the protesters' demands. That's the appointment of an independent commission of inquiry into the protests, and the conduct of the police in responding to them.\n\nBeijing ordered Lam not to withdraw the bill, or to launch any such an inquiry. The events, corroborated by three Reuters sources, demonstrate without a shadow of a doubt that the central Chinese government orders and directs the Hong Kong government, which is supposed to have great autonomy. In effect, it shows the \"One Country, Two Systems\" mechanism meant to govern Hong Kong is just a sham public relations front.\n\nLam, a second Reuters exclusive revealed, told a meeting of executives that she would resign, given the choice. She also said she has to \"serve two masters,\" despite only being appointed to govern Hong Kong - meaning she has only one master, a city she should represent to Beijing.\n\n\"For a chief executive to have caused this huge havoc to Hong Kong is unforgivable,\" she said in an audio recording in English. \"If I have a choice, the first thing is to quit, having made a deep apology.\"\n\nLam responded to this leak of her own words with another bit of legalese, saying she had not contemplated discussing a resignation with the central people's government. That of course does not rule out her having discussed such a move with any number of individuals. I'm sure they told her Beijing would not accept her stepping down.\n\nThe leaks, which I explained yesterday , have rather preposterously been called \"fake\" by the state-run Global Times newspaper, appear to have worked. No longer could Beijing sit back and blame everything on Lam and the local government.\n\nAnd suddenly there's progress. The simple legal withdrawal of a \"dead\" bill has happened. The tension in Hong Kong can ease. Lam, now detested by pro-Beijing loyalists who championed that bill, will likely resign after a face-saving period. Sure, this isn't over. But what a relief.\n\nLam has not announced an independent inquiry. She instead said she would \"fully support\" the work of the Independent Police Complaints Council, an existing body that generally handles individual cases of misconduct. She also said she would start a \"direct dialogue\" with the community this month. She also invited \"community leaders, professionals and academics\" to examine, independently, Hong Kong's deep-seated social problems, and advise the government on solutions.\n\nThe Hong Kong government is mostly appointed, not elected. So it never finds out at the ballot box what the Hong Kong people really want. It is a past master at conducting public consultations that it controls, then ignores.\n\nSo I doubt any of that blather will placate anyone, or achieve much. It also seems to lay the blame at Hong Kong's many social problems, when it is Beijing's meddling in Hong Kong's legal and political affairs that also causes a lot of the resentment.\n\nStill, it's a start. Let's hope it yields positive results.\n\nCathay also announced on Wednesday that its chairman, John Slosar, would also resign. He joins CEO Rupert Hogg and Hogg's chief lieutenant, Paul Loo, who stepped down last month. Hogg said the company could have handled its response to the protests better.\n\nThe markets weren't cheering Slosar out the exit aisle. He will be replaced by Patrick Healy, another representative from Swire Pacific (SWRAY) , which controls the airline and owns 45% of the stock. Slosar had been chairman of Swire Pacific, too, and at 63 is retiring a little early.\n\nThey're cheering the likelihood that life will get a little closer back to normal in Hong Kong. Forward bookings are down \"in the region of double digits,\" Cathay said in early August, due to unrest that has at times blocked Hong Kong's famously efficient airport. Tourists and business travels alike have seen tear gas on their TV screens.\n\nHong Kong is also the world's largest air-freight hub. The U.S.-China trade war plus fighting in Hong Kong's streets has been a double blow there. Cathay's cargo revenue fell 11.4% in the first half of the year, performance that mostly came before the protests got hot.\n\nHong Kong is a great city, one I've called home for 18 years. Many of its residents have been incredibly sad about what has taken place in the last three months. And angry. And really frustrated that there was no way forward.\n\nWith this actual, legal, final killing of the hated rendition bill, there's finally one step of advance.", "description": "Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam finally announced that a hated extradition bill will be terminated, legally.
