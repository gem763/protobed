I was too exhausted.\n\n\"I had two packets of wine gums. That's as close as I got to drinking.\"\n\n(Image: Jonathan Buckmaster)\n\nIn court, Gascoigne was said to have kissed the woman without her consent for four seconds in front of shocked passengers while the train was outside Darlington.\n\nHe maintains he only kissed the woman because she was being taunted over her weight by fellow passengers.\n\nA jury at Teesside Crown Court took nearly three hours to clear him of sexual assault and assault by beating.\n\nHe explained that he was haunted by the death of his nephew, Jay Kerrigan, in 2016.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nAn inquest ruled Jay accidentally overdosed on drugs at his girlfriend\u2019s home.\n\nThe hearing was told that he had battled mental problems and was tormented by schoolyard bullies.\n\nGazza told the Sunday Mirror: \u201cMy nephew Jay died, he was bullied and I never want to see that happen to someone else.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\"All I was doing was sticking up for the girl.\n\n\u201cI gave the girl a peck. I didn\u2019t mean anything sexual, I just heard what was said to her and wanted to help.\n\n\"If it was anyone else this would never have gone to court. I accept I\u2019m not liked by everyone.\"\n\nHe called the last year a \u201cnightmare\" and said he had worked hard to stay sober in the last six months.\n\n(Image: Jonathan Buckmaster)\n\n(Image: Jonathan Buckmaster)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in trouble but nothing like this. I worried people would stop me going down the high street and shout abuse at me, or stop me from being around their kids\", he said.\n\n\u201cI was thinking, \u2018Have I let the fans down?\u2019 Being on the sex offenders list \u2013 that\u2019s not me.\n\n\"This is the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever been through. There were times when I could have just f***ing locked the door, turned my phones off and just got bladdered.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve stayed strong \u2013 I\u2019ve had to. Even talking about this I could walk out and go get pissed now. But I know alcohol would make it worse.\u201d", "description": "Football legend Gazza tucked into two packets of wine gums after being cleared of sexual assault", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Jonathan Buckmaster", "Reuters", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20659402.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_JBP_DXX_PAULGASCOIGNE18101945JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
