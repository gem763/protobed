And the CBO estimates that the deficit will stay above $1 trillion over the next decade.\n\nThose projections stand in contrast to President Trump's campaign promises that even with revenue lost initially from his tax cuts, he would be able to eliminate the federal budget deficit with cuts in spending and increased growth generated by the tax cuts.\n\nThe budget showed that revenue rose 4% in the 2019 budget year, which ended Sept. 30, but that spending surged at twice that rate. Spending increased for defense programs and for the government's big benefit programs for the elderly, Social Security and Medicare.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin asserted that Trump's economic program was nevertheless working, with unemployment at its lowest point in nearly 50 years. Mnuchin argued that to put the budget on a sustainable path, Congress must enact proposals \"to cut wasteful and irresponsible spending.\"\n\nSo far, though, neither party has shown much interest in reducing the soaring deficits. Trump and Republicans seem content with the $1.5 trillion tax cut measure that Congress passed during Trump's first year in office. And Democrats who are running to oppose him in next year's election have proposed their own expensive spending plans, including Medicare for All.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden answers a question as Senator Elizabeth Warren reacts Thursday, Sept. 12, 2019, during a primary debate.

Phillip / AP\n\nWhile pledging to protect Social Security and other benefit programs, many of the Democratic presidential candidates have said they will roll back Trump's tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations to pay for their programs.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, budget deficits are on track to keep rising \u2014 thereby raising the national debt, as a percentage of the economy, to its highest point since the end of World War II.\n\nThe government did previously run $1 trillion annual deficits from 2009 through 2012, when the Obama administration was spending heavily to combat the effects of the 2008 financial crisis and the worst recession since the 1930s.\n\nThis time, the deficits are occurring at a dramatically different time: The unemployment rate is historically low, and the economy is in a record 11th year of expansion.", "description": "The surge is largely due to increased spending and revenue lost to GOP tax cuts", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/03/19/d4f557a6-b754-41fc-9a9e-9a6a3d16ea8e/thumbnail/1200x630/473b7fec868c21b738133918975896e5/133457162.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
