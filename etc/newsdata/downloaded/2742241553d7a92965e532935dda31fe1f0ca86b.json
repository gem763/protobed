These big corporations must pay more tax. They rely on our infrastructure, expertise and sales so must pay their fair share into society. Still outrageous.'\n\nAnd Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said: 'How many more examples of large-scale tax avoidance does this Government need?'\n\nFacebook's vice-president of northern Europe, Steve Hatch, said the company was investing heavily in the UK and will employ 3,000 people here by 2020.\n\n'The UK is now one of Facebook's most important hubs for global innovation,' he said.\n\n'Businesses across the country use our platforms to grow and revenue from customers supported by our UK teams is now recorded here so that any taxable profit is subject to UK tax.'\n\nFacebook also said it spent \u00a3356.2million on research and development in the UK last year, up from \u00a3263.7million in 2017.\n\nIt hired Mr Clegg to lead its global lobbying after a string of scandals, including data breaches and concerns about how it deals with extremist content.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development suggested re-allocating some profits and taxing rights that big tech giants pay, in countries where they have 'significant consumer-facing activities and generate their profits'.", "description": "Last year it employed 1,965 workers who were paid a staggering total of \u00a3230.2million in wages.
