Just when you\u2019ve downed one bad guy, an even tougher one appears out of the backcloth. For Tom Curry and Sam Underhill, their reward for seeing off Australia\u2019s back-row partnership of Michael Hooper and David Pocock on Saturday is arguably an even stiffer assignment: a showdown with the All Black loose forward pairing of Sam Cane and Ardie Savea, and a battle that could well determine the course of this weekend\u2019s World Cup semi-final.\n\nCane was in a generous mood as he faced the media in Tokyo on Monday afternoon, paying a warm if measured tribute to the young pair who have lit up England\u2019s tournament so far. Then again, when you\u2019ve stepped into the shoes of perhaps the greatest All Black of all time and overcome a broken neck, you\u2019re probably not daunted by a challenge.\n\nTo slip on the black No 7 jersey is to take possession of a cherished bloodline, going back through the great Richie McCaw and Josh Kronfeld to the likes of Michael Jones and Ian Kirkpatrick. And perhaps the greatest testament to Cane\u2019s indispensability to this All Blacks unit is that at his best, such comparisons do not disgrace him. Yet one of the curiosities of his 66-cap career is that to date, not one of them has come against England. That will change this weekend.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Curry and Underhill may be just 21 and 23, but their performances at this tournament have displayed a maturity beyond their years, making 36 tackles between them against Australia. \u201cUnderhill and Curry have been pretty impressive,\u201d Cane acknowledged. \u201cBoth have got a huge appetite for hard work, have very good skill-sets.\u201d Throw in the tussle of the No 8s between Kieran Read and Billy Vunipola, and you have all the makings of a thrilling match-up.\n\nThe trend towards playing two opensides at No 6 and No 7 is one Eddie Jones\u2019s side have deployed to good effect of late, offering greater fluidity in return for a little heft at the set piece. Back in August, Jones suggested that England might sacrifice Curry against the All Blacks in order to play an extra jumper in the lineout. Curry\u2019s stellar form, however, surely makes him safe for now.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Ratings: England vs Australia Show all 31 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Teams are so structured and probably the best chance to attack from unstructured [play] is turnover ball, so you might increase your chances ever so slightly.\u201d\n\nAnd when it comes to flexibility, few teams can touch this All Black back row. One of their greatest strengths is the way they can switch roles almost at will, deploying Cane\u2019s brilliant scramble-defence and Savea\u2019s superb ball running to sniff out opposition weaknesses wherever they appear. It is a unit designed, as captain and No 8 Kieran Read puts it, to \u201cmix and mingle and go where we\u2019re needed\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s a relatively untried pairing, boasting just four outings together, and one that came about largely by accident, after Liam Squire was injured during the recent Rugby Championship. \u201cArdie has been working really hard on some of his set-piece work, which a No 6 is required to do a little bit more,\u201d said Cane. \u201cBut bar the set piece, our roles are pretty interchangeable.\u201d\n\nOf course, Cane is lucky still to be around. It\u2019s barely a year since he went in to clear a ruck against South Africa, got his head caught, and ended up breaking his neck, an injury that required a steel plate and four screws. Now, it\u2019s Cane looking to turn the screws on the English, in a battle of the breakdown with a World Cup final at stake.", "description": "Like levels in a computer game, World Cups\u00a0increase their difficulty in small but devastating increments.
