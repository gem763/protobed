The bill, a bipartisan effort supported by Trump and buoyed by high profile celebrities like CNN\u2019s Van Jones, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, reduces prison sentences for some federal crimes and provides support services for currently and formerly incarcerated men and women. But the decision by the center to single out Trump for his efforts at an event that substantially restricted student and faculty access at the predominantly black college was a showcase in hypocrisy and rightly garnered widespread condemnation.\n\nThe location was itself a cruel juxtaposition. Blacks make up 55 percent of the Democratic primary electorate in South Carolina, a state where the confederate flag once flew over the capitol.\n\nThe First Step Act was a sorely needed reform. Statistics reveal that one in three black men in this country spend time in prison during their lifetimes; 56 percent of the prison population is comprised of black and Latino Americans, and while African Americans are roughly 13.4 percent of the U.S. population, they alone comprise 34 percent of those in prison. So striking are the numbers and lingering effects of disrupted lives and families that a 2015 New York Times report proclaimed there are \u201c1.5 million missing black men\u201d due to incarceration or early death.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe First Step Act\u2019s sponsors, Sens.

Decades-long increased militarization of local police departments came into full view. Sen. Paul felt compelled to speak on these issues in a piece for Time Magazine in which he pointed out that \u201cGiven the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them.\u201d Repeated attempts to move the legislation forward have been stalled by Republicans.\n\nConsidering the sinuous path and significant political capital expended to achieve reform, why does Trump\u2019s award feel so offensive? First, Democrats have a healthy distrust for his motives given past interactions and comments. Second, as a New York political gadfly and provocateur, Trump spent his own money on full page ads urging the death penalty for the Central Park 5, who have since been exonerated. In fact, earlier this year after a powerful film by Ava DuVernay exploded into the national consciousness, the president doubled down on his feelings about the case. Furthermore, Trump\u2019s attitudes toward racial hierarchy are evident in comments referring to \u201cs-hole\u201d countries and his characterization of urban, mostly minority, populations including a widely publicized shot at the late Rep. Elijah Cummings Elijah Eugene CummingsSpecial election to fill Cummings seat to be held on same day as Md. presidential primary Man explains refusing to shake McConnell's hand at Cummings memorial: 'I couldn't do it' Paul Ryan launches new nonprofit MORE (D-Md.) and Baltimore.\n\nTrump never misses an opportunity to contradict himself. So three days after being honored in South Carolina, Trump launched into a diatribe against Chicago\u2019s leadership by intimating that its police chief and status as a sanctuary city contribute to the crime rate at a conference for international chiefs of police taking place there.\n\nThe inherent danger to communities of color is that away from the public events, Trump\u2019s sentiments can be amplified and promoted through the federal bureaucracy. The administration\u2019s first attorney general, Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsJeff Sessions calling Alabama lawmakers about 2020 Senate bid Sessions eyeing old Senate seat: report The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - Dems shift strategy on impeachment vote MORE, reinforced an ugly narrative about cities and communities of color by routinely calling out Obama and Democrats for their supposedly lax approach to crime and punishment. Such accusations fly in the face of years of data showing a substantial decrease in crime and decreasing incarceration rates for all populations, including African Americans.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSessions went further by issuing a directive in 2017 to U.S. attorneys requiring prosecutors to push for the most serious charges on crimes. Oddly, the administration also opposed reforms in Chicago\u2019s police department after the shooting of Laquan McDonald and reversed a plan to decrease number of private prisons.\n\nGiven Trump\u2019s track record, should it matter that criminal justice reform passed because of his penchant for courting celebrities? The men and women whose lives have been forever altered by the prison system may not care how the law came to fruition. But the president\u2019s cringe-worthy remarks likening the impeachment process to lynching and the plight of black Americans \u2013 and the failure to engage activists including one who literally wrote the book on criminal justice reform \u2013 suggests the path to substantive change will be fraught with contradiction and peppered with insult to injury.\n\nBasil A.
