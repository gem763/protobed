A drilling rig in New Mexico\n\nThe numbers: U.S. industrial production jumped 0.6% in August, the largest increase in a year, the Federal Reserve reported Tuesday. Output in July was revised to a 0.1% decline from the prior estimate of a 0.2% drop.\n\nWall Street had expected a 0.4% rebound, according to a MarketWatch survey.\n\nWhat happened: The increase was due mainly to a surge in mining output, which includes oil and gas production. Mining output jumped 1.4%, almost completely reversing a 1.5% decline in the prior month. Utilities output rose 0.6%.\n\nManufacturing production rebounded as well in August, rising 0.5% after a 0.4% decline in July.\n\nOutput for motor vehicles and parts fell 1% in August after a 0.5% gain in the prior month. Excluding autos, manufacturing rose 0.6%.\n\nCapacity utilization rose to 77.9% in August, the highest rate since March. The capacity utilization rate reflects the limits to operating the nation\u2019s factories, mines and utilities. It\u2019s still below pre-2008 recession levels, above 80%, that could increase production costs and prices.\n\nBig picture: U.S. manufacturing remains in a recession due to weakness in the global economy and Trump\u2019s trade war with China. The weakness is a main reason why the Federal Reserve is expected to cut its benchmark interest rate for the second time this year on Wednesday. The industrial sector could also be hurt by the strike at General Motors Co. GM, +2.90% , now in its second day.\n\nWhat are they saying? \u201cWe expect the trend in manufacturing output to fall through the end of the year, at least,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He said the two factors boosting production in August \u2014 crude oil and manufacturing output \u2014 won\u2019t last.\n\nMarket reaction: Stocks ended the session higher on optimism about possible easing of U.S. and China trade tensions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.13% was up 33.98 to close at 27,110 while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.26% was up 7.74 to close at 3,005.70.", "description": "U.S. industrial output rose 0.6% in August, the largest gain in a year, the Federal Reserve said Tuesday.", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR389_oil_dr_ZG_20190916134300.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
