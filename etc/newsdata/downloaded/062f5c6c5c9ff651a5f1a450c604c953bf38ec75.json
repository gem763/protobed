People who are good with money are always looking for a way to live within their means and spend less than they need to. We collected money tips and spending preferences from experts and people who have accomplished admirable feats like paying off their mortgage early, eliminating five figures of debt, and putting $100,000 in savings.\n\nThere are some purchases and habits that just make no sense to those who are truly good with money \u2013 here are the top seven things they aren\u2019t likely to buy or spend on.\n\nThey\u2019re not buying brand new cars\n\nsource REUTERS/Mark Blinch\n\n\u201cThe person who was actually has several hundred thousand in the bank or may even be a millionaire is going to drive a 5-year-old car or a 10-year-old car,\u201d says personal finance expert and author Lynette Khalfani-Cox.\n\nA new car loses 10% of its value in the first month, and 20% of its value in the first year, reports Business Insider contributor Steven John. Someone who\u2019s good with money won\u2019t want to take on that kind of loss.\n\nThose who are good with money know that the best value comes from buying used, and that by keeping the same car for a while, they can save a lot.\n\nAnd they\u2019re not leasing a new car constantly, either\n\nWhen it comes to leasing, Khalfani-Cox says that someone who\u2019s good with money will likely turn the other way. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to say, \u2018oh, let me lease this $50,000 car, and then next year let me lease another one,'\u201d she says.\n\nLeases will still involve down payments, and though the monthly payment and up-front payments may be lower, you\u2019ll never own anything like you could with a loan. Though a lease might seem like a way to dodge debt in the short term, those who are good with money will see it in a different light.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re motivated by the lowest long-term cost, buying and keeping your cars longer will make more financial sense,\u201d Alain Nana-Sinkam, the vice president of strategic initiatives at TrueCar, previously told Business Insider\u2019s Tanza Loudenback.\n\nThose who are good with money are likely to be less caught up in needing the latest and greatest, meaning a lease won\u2019t really be the best option for them.\n\nThey won\u2019t buy houses they can\u2019t afford\n\nsource Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nThose who are good with money aren\u2019t looking to spend more than they can afford on a home, and they know that the best piece of real estate is the one they can afford.\n\nBusiness Insider contributor Holly Johnson saved aggressively to pay off her home by age 40, and travels for multiple months of the year by spending frugally and leveraging credit card benefits.\n\nAnd when it came to buying a house, she and her husband bought a significantly smaller house than they could have to pursue early retirement and living mortgage-free. \u201cHousing affordability calculators have always told us we could spend double, triple, or more than we did on a home,\u201d writes Johnson. \u201cBut we have always ignored them and forged our own path.\u201d\n\nInstead of buying a large, expensive house, they opted to spend on experiences. If they\u2019d bought a larger house, she writes, \u201cwe would have a lot less money to save and invest each month toward early retirement. We would also have to drastically curb our annual travel budget.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re not buying things on credit that they can\u2019t pay for\n\nsource Westend61/Getty Images\n\nWhether it\u2019s a $2,000 purchase or a $20 purchase, those who are good with money won\u2019t pay interest on their purchases.\n\nCarrying a balance on your credit card means you\u2019ll be charge interest every month, and it won\u2019t be cheap, either \u2013 many credit cards will charge interest rates of 25% or more.\n\nBusiness Insider writer Elizabeth Aldrich racked up $10,000 worth of debt in her 20s. But, since then, she\u2019s learned from her past and has become good with money, paying it all off in three years and building a $20,000 emergency fund in six months.\n\nAs she looked back on the money mistakes that got her into debt, she cites carrying a credit card balance as one of the biggest issues. \u201cEvery month I would run up a balance on my credit card and then pay off what I could by the end of the month,\u201d she writes. She also writes that this habit caused her to \u201cspend thousands of dollars on credit card interest in my 20s.\u201d\n\nNow, she never spends money on interest.\n\nThey\u2019re not buying luxury goods from brand-name designers\n\nThose who are good with money are \u201cless interested in brand names or tags and labels,\u201d says Khalfani-Cox. And it seems that those with wealth are starting to take this cue from those who are good with money.\n\nAs Business Insider\u2019s Hillary Hoffower reports, \u201cshowing off wealth is no longer the way to signify having wealth. In the US particularly, the top 1% have been spending less on material goods since 2007.\u201d\n\nInstead of material items, many wealthy people these days are opting to spend on privacy, exclusive wellness and fitness routines, and investing in education instead of buying designer items.\n\nAnd they\u2019re less likely to load up on material items at all, opting for quality over quantity\n\nsource Getty\n\nThose who are good with money aren\u2019t filling their closets with fast fashion clothing and buying an abundance of cheap things that will break. Instead, they\u2019d rather put money into items that will last.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re more concerned with quality as opposed to quantity,\u201d says Khalfani-Cox. She continues: \u201cI think people who are good with money are often not afraid to go against the grain and to actively unplug from consumerism.\u201d\n\nAnd they probably aren\u2019t planning lavish, expensive weddings\n\nAnyone who\u2019s planned a wedding knows just how costly they can be. But those who are good with money aren\u2019t planning to spend lots of money on their ceremony.\n\nNathan Clarke of The Millionaire Dojo used aggressive savings techniques and investments to sock away over $100,000 in savings by age 25, and he has hopes of becoming financially independent and is pursuing his goals of becoming a millionaire.\n\nFor him and his now-wife, one of the things that helped him to reach $100,000 in savings was a low-cost wedding. They spent just $10,000 on the big day, and saved aggressively instead of spending on the wedding.\n\n\u201cReally, all we paid for was all the decorations, food and a little bit for the reception venue,\u201d writes Clarke. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why people think they have to spend $50k on a wedding. I\u2019d rather travel the world for a year with $50k than spend it on one day.\u201d", "description": "Business Insider - People who are good with money aren't buying or leasing new cars, chasing designer items, or wanting the biggest and best houses..
