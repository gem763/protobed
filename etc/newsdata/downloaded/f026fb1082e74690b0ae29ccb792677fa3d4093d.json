And he notes that negotiations are \u201cprogressing well\u201d.\n\nThrough its network of more than 24 free trade agreements with 36 trading partners, trade now accounts for more than three times Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nIndeed, trade has become the republic\u2019s lifeblood.\n\n\u201cOur FTAs are with countries that collectively account for more than 85% of global GDP and more than 90% of Singapore\u2019s trade,\u201d says Iswaran. \u201cThese FTAs have gained our businesses access to millions of consumers in markets across the globe.\u201d\n\nHe notes that the FTAs have provided preferential access to service sectors, expanded government procurement opportunities, and improved intellectual property protections.\n\n\u201cThese FTAs also provide legal certainty and help to safeguard the interests of Singapore businesses in overseas markets,\u201d he adds.\n\nAccording to a study by the Ministry of Trade and Industry, businesses are estimated to gain an average of 18% higher trade deals after two years and a further 16% in the third year as a results of these FTAs.\n\nThis has translated into businesses saving about $720 million in tariffs in 2016, higher than the $450 million saved a decade before that.\n\nAnd now, the Singapore Business Federation is intensifying its outreach and education efforts to increase awareness and help businesses to navigate FTAs, so that more Singapore companies expand into new markets.\n\nEven so, Iswaran opines that the current trade regulations do not sufficiently address digital needs. With digitalisation becoming more rampant, he notes the need to beef up digital trade regulations.\n\nHe also emphasises that free and open trade does not always generate equitable outcomes, noting that this why Singapore is investing in training of workers and helping businesses transform and adapt to the digital era.\n\n\"Where necessary, we make government transfers to ensure we share the benefits across society and uplift the most vulnerable. These measures help to ensure that the benefits of free trade are equitably distributed, and that we progress as one cohesive society,\" Iswaran says.\n\nAmid an uncertain global economy, Iswaran notes that there have been constraints to multilateral negotiations due to wide ranging interest that tempt members to converge on the lowest common denominator.\n\n\"We were clear then, as we are now, that our pursuit of FTAs can and should complement and not supplant multilateralism. Bilateral and plurilateral FTAs are a practical way for like-minded parties to work towards a more ambitious level of trade liberalisation,\" he says.", "description": "SINGAPORE (Oct 24): Singapore is looking to lead digital trade efforts at the World Trade Organization through a Joint Statement Initiative (JSI) on e-commerce, says S Iswaran, Minister in-charge of Trade Relations.
