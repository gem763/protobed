I felt the same way about theatre adapters mucking up classic films while I sat through this babyish travesty of a comic masterpiece.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame, as the show is set in the post-war period and fronted by Stephen Mangan, a genial comic actor with big Fifties teeth. He plays the hapless inventor Sidney Stratton \u2013 the Alec Guinness part in the original film \u2013 who invents an everlasting polymer fabric that never gets dirty.\n\nClothes made of it will never wear out.\n\nThe show is set in the post-war period and fronted by Stephen Mangan, a genial comic actor with big Fifties teeth and joined by the lissom Kara Tointon as Daphne (both above)\n\nThat means no jobs for the mill-workers and nosediving profits for the factory owners. Suddenly, the idealistic Sidney finds himself the enemy of the people, the unions and bosses.\n\nEven the cosy washerwoman \u2013 Sue Johnston in crinkly tights, a sight I\u2019m keen to forget \u2013 thinks Sidney\u2019s a fool.\n\nMangan is joined by the lissom Kara Tointon as Daphne, unenviably stuck in the part played on screen by the sublime, sexy-voiced Joan Greenwood. A Strictly Come Dancing winner, Tointon has a seduction scene designed simply to show off her slinky pins.\n\nIT'S A FACT When Alec Guinness met James Dean, Dean showed him his new Porsche. Guinness said: 'Get rid of it, you'll be dead in a week.' He was.\n\nRichard Cordery overacts as her blustering bore of a father; Richard Durden is the cruel capitalist.\n\nI grew increasingly irritated by writer-director Sean Foley\u2019s garish adaptation, with its fart-noise laboratory, innuendo and bunged-in Brexit references. The show, meanwhile, neglects the film\u2019s delicious, gentle cynicism, and its lesson that nothing lasts for ever except human frailty.\n\nThe recipe here is to keep things frantic and noisy. There\u2019s a skiffle band, ghastly pub songs (by Noah and the Whale\u2019s Charlie Fink) and, worse, an outbreak of clog-dancing.\n\nOnly the final chase on an L S Lowry-style townscape evokes any real Ealing charm.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know the film and love Mangan, you can expect two hours of farcical northern nonsense and add an extra star to this review. But in my view, an imperishable English classic has been turned into a crass theatrical knees-up.\n\nPride And Prejudice* (*Sort Of)\n\nBristol Old Vic Touring until March, 2hrs 45mins\n\nRating:\n\nIn this rambunctious, Glasgow-originated show, a cast of six women play servants acting out the novel. It\u2019s fast and feminist, but it\u2019s also infectiously funny. Moreover, despite the offputting \u2018sort of\u2019 tag, the book\u2019s plot is fully intact.\n\nForget Colin Firth and costumed actors poncing about in the usual BBC style. Expect modern props, Doc Martens, and karaoke disco hits at the drop of a bonnet. Elizabeth even belts out You\u2019re So Vain at Mr Darcy, the Carly Simon song that Jane Austen might well have written herself.\n\nThe dialogue is loaded with non-Regency profanities, and the famous Netherfield Ball is an almighty drunken bender. The five sisters throng bolshily under the eye of the squawking Mrs Bennet.\n\nIn this rambunctious, Glasgow-originated show, a cast of six women play servants acting out the novel. It\u2019s fast and feminist, but it\u2019s also infectiously funny\n\nMr Bennet never says a single word \u2013 that\u2019s because he isn\u2019t even an actor, just a propped-up newspaper in an armchair!\n\nIn this account (by the company Blood Of The Young), the spirit of Jane Austen is somehow preserved in this wacky reimagining of the book, one that removes the stately home theatrics to find a very different sense and sensibility, involving beer crates and hand microphones.\n\nIt\u2019s emotionally fraught, too. Writer Isobel McArthur (she also plays Darcy and Mrs Bennet) amplifies Austen\u2019s focus on the brutal economic reality for the book\u2019s women.\n\nIt\u2019s a crisis embodied in Meghan Tyler\u2019s grieving Elizabeth (above with Felixe Forde), an obstreperous \u2018persona non-starter\u2019, emotionally devastated at her sisters\u2019 stark choice\n\nIt\u2019s a crisis embodied in Meghan Tyler\u2019s grieving Elizabeth, an obstreperous \u2018persona non-starter\u2019, emotionally devastated at her sisters\u2019 stark choice: marriage or destitution.\n\nPining love erupts over the stage in the old-gold soundtrack that includes Candi Staton, Andy Williams, Pulp, The Shirelles and Etta James. It\u2019s mad but it works.\n\nWhy not frogmarch an Eng Lit-studying teenager to what they think will be a boring Jane Austen night out \u2013 then watch their sulky face light up at what follows.\n\nThe Niceties\n\nFinborough Theatre, London Until October 26, 2hrs\n\nRating:\n\nDon\u2019t ever envy an American professor. This one (played by musical star Janie Dee) is making suggestions to a black student on how to improve her essay on the effect of slavery on the American Revolution.\n\nThe student, Zoe, thinks her paper has all it needs. While Zoe talks like a flaky millennial, she is in fact made of titanium. Seething at what she sees as the professor\u2019s patronising, racist, white privilege, she ruthlessly sets out to destroy her career.\n\nThis campus play \u2013 set in the Obama era \u2013 starts out with a buzz. But author Eleanor Burgess\u2019s sympathies are too weighted in favour of the verbose but decent, lesbian, liberal prof to be dramatic.\n\nAn American Professor (Janie Dee) is making suggestions to a black student (Moronke Akinola) on how to improve her essay on the effect of slavery on the American Revolution\n\nI found myself rooting for the take-no-prisoners student, superbly played with a fierce sense of grievance by newcomer Moronke Akinola.\n\nThe steam, however, completely goes out of the thing in the over-talky second half, as the professor \u2013 Janie Dee visibly struggling with her cardboard part \u2013 negotiates her fate. Successful plays for two actors are rare. This isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nThe Last King Of Scotland\n\nCrucible, Sheffield Until Saturday, 2hrs 45mins\n\nRating:\n\nFirst a novel in 1998, then an award-winning film, now Giles Foden\u2019s grimly believable story about a Scottish doctor who becomes right-hand man to Ugandan dictator Idi Amin is adapted for the stage by Steve Waters.\n\nIt\u2019s always absorbing, offering a double image of two men capable of incredible self-delusion. And it boasts a terrific performance by Tobi Bamtefa, who captures the knife-edge capriciousness of the megalomaniac Amin.\n\nHe brings a big, tough presence \u2013 but also a sense of the ridiculous, a huge laugh and excellent comic timing. Daniel Portman is too inscrutable as the doctor, Nick Garrigan, however: the motivations for his ethical slide aren\u2019t always clear.\n\nIt boasts a terrific performance by Tobi Bamtefa, who captures the knife-edge capriciousness of the megalomaniac Amin but Daniel Portman is too inscrutable as the doctor, Nick Garrigan\n\nAnd until its harrowing final part, Gbolahan Obisesan\u2019s production lacks dynamism and danger. It might have worked better in a more intimate space \u2013 the action feels too diffuse on the Crucible\u2019s big stage, and it could be bolder with its use of music and movement.\n\nThe Last King Of Scotland proves \u2013 once more \u2013 a powerful story about the grotesque rise and fall of a despot, but this play doesn\u2019t make a strong case for theatre being the best way to tell it.\n\nHolly Williams\n\nMy Beautiful Laundrette\n\nCurve, Leicester Touring until November 9, 2hrs 25mins\n\nRating:\n\nHanif Kureishi has adapted his seminal 1985 film, about an unlikely love affair between Omar, a young man of Pakistani heritage, and Johnny, a white youth, for the stage.\n\nThe movie broke boundaries and crisply critiqued Thatcherite Britain; the play\u2019s portrayal of Omar\u2019s entrepreneurial family still feels stereotype-busting, and the racial tensions have obvious resonance in an era when the far-Right is on the rise.\n\nBut Kureishi\u2019s style \u2013 an elliptical, off-kilter, heightened naturalism \u2013 can pose challenges, and Nikolai Foster\u2019s production rarely rises to them. The jokes never land, the pace is off, and no one really plays the subtext.\n\nThere are lovely moments, such as the pride and pleasure Omar (Omar Malik) and Johnny (Jonny Fines, very good) take in cleaning up the grotty laundrette Omar\u2019s uncle gives him\n\nThere are occasional lovely moments, such as the pride and pleasure Omar (Omar Malik) and Johnny (Jonny Fines, very good) take in cleaning up the grotty laundrette Omar\u2019s uncle gives him. But too often characters feel two-dimensional.\n\nGrace Smart\u2019s set evokes the period with Day-Glo graffiti, neon signage and scaffolding \u2013 but its junkyard clutter hampers the actors stuck in its midst. And Foster\u2019s production squanders one of its great selling points: they got Pet Shop Boys to compose new music, yet we hear little more than snatches of synths in scene changes.\n\nAs with much else here, it seems like a missed opportunity.\n\nHolly Williams", "description": "'Why can't you scientists leave things alone,' says a charlady in the 1951 black-and-white Ealing comedy on which this is based.", "authors": ["Robert Gore-Langton For Event Magazine"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/15/19542012-0-image-a-83_1570718233960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
