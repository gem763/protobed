Xiaomi says the Mi Mix Alpha\u2019s screen would be made of sapphire glass, which is extremely scratch-resistant.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nChinese tech giant Xiaomi just revealed on Tuesday a new 5G concept smartphone called the Mi Mix Alpha. It has a screen that wraps almost all the way around the phone, and it looks utterly incredible.\n\nThe only thing preventing the screen from wrapping around the phone entirely is a thin ceramic strip along the back where the Mi Mix Alpha\u2019s triple-lens camera system is seated.\n\nThe Mi Mix Alpha doesn\u2019t look like a phone you\u2019d ever want to put down on any surface for the fear of scratching it. But that\u2019s fine, because it\u2019s just a concept that no one can buy or use right now.\n\nHowever, Xiaomi appears to have thought of that, even for the concept. The company said the Mi Mix Alpha\u2019s glass is 2.88g sapphire. To be honest, I\u2019m not sure that that means, but I do know that sapphire is designed to be extremely scratch-resistant.\n\nOh, and the Mi Mix Alpha\u2019s frame would be made of \u201cTC4 aerospace-grade titanium alloy\u201d that Xiaomi says is three times as strong as steel. Casual.\n\nThere\u2019s no telling how much this marvel costs, or even if it\u2019ll ever make it to store shelves. After all, Xiaomi itself said it\u2019s a concept. Either way, it should be a hint to all smartphone makers for what to do in the next few years. I am ready for it.\n\nCheck out the Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha:\n\nThe Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha is essentially a phone that\u2019s almost entirely made of screen. It has a 180.6% screen-to-body ratio, Xiaomi said.\n\nThere\u2019s only a thin strip of ceramic down the back of the phone for the cameras. Otherwise, the screen wraps around the side and all the way to the thin cameras strip.\n\nIf this phone ever makes it past the concept stage, there would be three cameras on the back, including:\n\nA 108-megapixel primary camera\n\nA 20-megapixel ultra-wide-lens\n\nA 12-megapixel telephoto zoomed lens.\n\nThe Mi Mix Alpha looks better while charging than any other smartphone.\n\nI\u2019d imagine that the Mi Mix Alpha\u2019s charging animation might take up a considerable amount of power on its own. As amazing as this looks, the animation might be better as an option for those who don\u2019t mind slower charging speeds.\n\nEven when it\u2019s telling you that you have a notification, it looks better than any other smartphone.\n\nA lot of Android phone makers these days are ditching the signature Android notification light. Xiaomi is bringing it back in a very, very big way on the Mi Mix Alpha. Although, remember, the Mi Mix Alpha is still a concept, so this might never see the light of day.\n\nThe sides have pressure-sensitive sensors, presumably for the power and volume buttons.\n\nWith a pressure sensitive screen wrapped around the edge, it\u2019s not outlandish to think that you could set a variety of functions for the Mi Mix Alpha\u2019s edges, like app shortcuts and camera buttons.\n\nIt simply looks better than any other smartphone, period.\n\nXiaomi said the Mi Mix Alpha will have \u201cmiss-touch detection\u201d so that it doesn\u2019t register false touches when you hold it.\n\nWhat Xiaomi didn\u2019t say is when, or if, the Mi Mix Alpha would be released, and how much it would cost, but I\u2019d estimate a phone like the Mi Mix Alpha would cost well over the $1,000 mark.", "description": "Business Insider - The Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha is only a concept, but the company even adresses your concerns about the screen's scratch-resistance..
