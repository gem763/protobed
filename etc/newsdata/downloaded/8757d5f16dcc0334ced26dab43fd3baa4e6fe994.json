How the new season's cast could shape the primary", "language": "en", "text": "Welcome to \u201c2020 Vision,\u201d the Yahoo News column covering the presidential race with one key takeaway every weekday and a wrap-up each weekend. Reminder: There are 126 days until the Iowa caucuses and 400 days until the 2020 election.\n\nOver the weekend, various 2020 Democrats fanned out to various early primary states, where they made various cases for their candidacies. In Oakland, Calif., Kamala Harris was railing against the perception that she lacks \u201celectability.\u201d In South Carolina, Elizabeth Warren was courting black voters. And in New Hampshire, Bernie Sanders was breakfasting with Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez before addressing college students.\n\nBut the real 2020 action might have been Saturday night on NBC.\n\n\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d returned this weekend for its 45th season, renewing a tradition of lampooning presidents (and would-be presidents) that stretches back to the show\u2019s earliest days. In a sharp 10-minute sketch, cast members and guest stars playing the various Democratic candidates \u201cunited together and decided,\u201d in the words of Cecily Strong, portraying CNN anchor Erin Burnett, to \u201chandle the impeachment the only way they know how \u2014 with a muddled 10-person town hall debate.\u201d\n\nThe real candidates took notice.\n\n\u201cThat girl being played by @MayaRudolph on @nbcsnl?\u201d Harris gamely tweeted. \u201cThat girl was me\u201d \u2014 repeating the line she used to skewer Joe Biden in an exchange about school busing during the first Democratic debate, which was the basis of the sketch in which Rudolph appeared.\n\nFrom left, Larry David as Bernie Sanders, Woody Harrelson as Joe Biden and Maya Rudolph as Kamala Harris on \"Saturday Night Live\" on Sept. 28.

For much of its history, \u201cSNL\u201d has powerfully shaped public perception of the personalities of our presidents. Today, millions of Americans remember Gerald Ford as the doofus who looked like Chevy Chase and tripped over his own feet. Jimmy Carter is that Dan Aykroyd-like figure delivering smooth technocratic answers to citizen questions on live radio. George H.W. Bush is a vague, feckless Dana Carvey shaking his head and saying \u201cNa ga da it.\u201d And so on.\n\nThe internet, meanwhile, has only enhanced the political potency of \u201cSNL.\u201d Now that its funniest moments can go viral, the show has the power to define candidates much earlier and more indelibly than ever. Just look at what Tina Fey did to Sarah Palin: Research has shown that in 2008, Republicans and independents who watched Fey spoof John McCain\u2019s running mate were more likely than nonviewers to see her negatively.\n\nSo what did we learn from the first round of 2020 impersonations? Should the candidates be afraid?\n\nFor most of those polling in the single digits, the answer is yes. Dismissed by Strong\u2019s Burnett character as the \u201cguy who tragically misread our enthusiasm for him,\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke (Alex Moffat) was portrayed as a pathetic Gen X lightweight (\u201cThanks for, like, still having me around, this is rad!\u201d) desperate to show off his \u201ceighth-grade Spanish.\u201d Andrew Yang (Bowen Yang, no relation) complained that he\u2019s \u201cliterally giving free money to people and I\u2019m still in sixth place.\u201d Cory Booker (Chris Redd) was a bug-eyed, low-polling oddball who was allotted only five words before Burnett (Strong) allowed him to \u201cleave now to beat traffic.\u201d A slowly gyrating Marianne Williamson (Chloe Fineman) appeared via \u201castral projection\u201d and offered to \u201ctrap\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s \u201csoul inside this crystal.\u201d Pete Buttigieg (Colin Jost) confirmed the pronunciation of his name.", "description": "\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d returned this weekend for its 45th season, renewing a tradition of lampooning presidents (and would-be presidents) that stretches back to the show\u2019s earliest days.", "authors": ["Andrew Romano", "West Coast Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KfwspSa2z7iIE.y3mvucig--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/4dd1c690-e3b5-11e9-aa9f-e9d385715e1f", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
