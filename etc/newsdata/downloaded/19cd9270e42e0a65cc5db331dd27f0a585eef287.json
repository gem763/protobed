REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson\n\nScarf, who joins the fourth-largest U.S. bank after a 2-year stint leading Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N), will become Wells Fargo\u2019s third CEO in as many years. Former CEOs Tim Sloan and John Stumpf resigned amid sales practices scandals that have plagued the bank since 2016.\n\nScharf is taking over a bank that is still operating under a regulatory microscope, trying to rebuild its reputation with customers, investors and politicians.\n\nStill, he struck an upbeat tone on a call with analysts following his appointment.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t come in with a preconceived notion that there has got to be some kind of dramatic change,\u201d Scharf said. \u201cThe first priority is to make sure we get the regulatory issues behind us to help create the foundation that we need to continue to build the company.\u201d\n\nScharf is a hard-working leader who focuses on making operations more efficient rather than a charismatic visionary, said a source familiar with his leadership style.\n\nAlthough Scharf, 54, said he had imagined that BNY would be his last job, he has always had aspirations to be a big bank CEO, the source said.\n\nPrior to joining the custodian bank, Scharf held the top job at Visa Inc (V.N), the world\u2019s largest payment network. He started his career in 1987 at Commercial Credit Corp, a consumer finance company run by Jamie Dimon and Sandy Weill - executives who went on to lead two of America\u2019s biggest banks.\n\nHEAVY LIFT\n\nWall Street analysts cheered the conclusion of a search that has dragged on for 6 months, and applauded the board\u2019s pick of a banking veteran who has experience leading a diverse array of businesses.\n\nUncertainty about management has been cited as a top concern for analysts since Sloan\u2019s departure in March. Wells Fargo\u2019s stock edged up 1% during that period while the KBW Bank Index rallied 7%.\n\nHowever, bank analysts said clearing regulatory hurdles will still be a tough task, as Wells Fargo is currently operating under more than a dozen regulatory consent orders.\n\n\u201cThe appointment of Mr. Scharf removes a major overhang,\u201d Saul Martinez of UBS wrote in a note to clients. Still, he added, \u201cwe think getting past the heavy lift of the consent order is necessary for Wells to be able to reduce its cost base.\u201d\n\nKBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said he was unsure what to expect from Scharf as Wells\u2019 CEO since his tenure at Bank of New York Mellon lasted only for two years.\n\n\u201cScharf\u2019s first task will be appeasing regulators and making the changes necessary to remove the asset cap currently in place,\u201d Kleinhanzl said.\n\n\u201cHe moves from a bank with far less retail business than Wells Fargo, so he will face a steep learning curve,\u201d said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business.\n\nSeparately, BNY Mellon named finance head Thomas Gibbons as its CEO on an interim basis. The bank also said Scharf had forfeited all of his equity and incentive awards, which were unvested as of Thursday.\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s board had considered keeping its interim CEO, Allen Parker, on a permanent basis even after saying it would seek an outsider to fill the role, sources had told Reuters in June. Parker will stay with the company to help the transition and as general counsel\n\nWells said Scharf\u2019s base salary at the bank would be $2.5 million - nearly the same as Sloan\u2019s base pay in 2018.\n\nRegulatory filings showed that Scharf\u2019s total compensation for 2018 at BNY was $9.4 million. Sloan\u2019s total compensation for the year was $18.4 million.\n\nShares of Wells Fargo were up nearly 4.% at $50.83 in late-morning trading.", "description": "Wells Fargo & Co on Friday named banking veteran Charles Scharf its next chief executive officer effective next month, ending a six-month search.", "authors": ["Imani Moise", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434510246&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0RC", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
