The headline was promptly changed.\u201d\n\nBut not before critics, including the president\u2019s children, pounced.\n\nEnemy of the people??? With headlines like this and the fact that the @washingtonpost and others in the MSM have harsher criticism for The President of The United States than they do for the leader of ISIS, a known serial rapist and murderer, you really have to start to wonder!!! pic.twitter.com/JH448bCA7Y \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 27, 2019\n\nUnreal.\n\nal-Baghdadi described as \u201cAustere religious scholar\u201d instead of \u201cterrorist\u201d in Washpo Obituary headline. pic.twitter.com/3fTxBMInLo \u2014 Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) October 27, 2019\n\nI have no words. https://t.co/4zH9Ji0Smy \u2014 Stephanie Grisham (@PressSec) October 27, 2019\n\nEvery day The Washington Post uses harsher words against @realDonaldTrump than they do in writing about one of the world\u2019s most evil terrorists.
