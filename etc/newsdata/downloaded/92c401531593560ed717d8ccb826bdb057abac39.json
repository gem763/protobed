The House of Commons Speaker will decide whether the government gets to present MPs with a \"straight-up-and-down vote\" on Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit deal with the EU later. Ministers argue that Saturday's vote for an amendment to their motion means that the House hasn't yet had a proper chance to decide on the actual substance of the issue.\n\nBut Mr Bercow could rule that the government is effectively asking for the same thing to be debated twice. If that happens, there probably won't be a discussion or a vote.\n\nHowever, the government also plans to introduce the legislation required to implement the Brexit deal - the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - during Monday's Commons session.\n\nFollowing Saturday's events, Mr Johnson, as required under law, requested from the EU a delay to the Brexit deadline, beyond 31 October. But his letter was unsigned and was accompanied by a signed one saying any further postponement \"would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners\".\n\nScotland's highest court will consider today whether this complied with the law or was intended to \"frustrate\" it.\n\nHere are some words and graphics explaining what could happen next in the Brexit saga.\n\nMeanwhile, try our simple Brexit guide.\n\nHarry: I'll protect my family\n\nThe Duke of Sussex has opened up on some personal aspects of his life.

The prince also talked about his relationship with his brother, saying they had \"good days\" and \"bad days\".

In the capital Santiago, rioters have set fire to a garment factory, where five people died. The government has imposed a state of emergency. Here are pictures of what's going on in Chile.\n\nWhy is Spain digging up a dictator?\n\nGeneral Francisco Franco ruled Spain from 1939 until his death in 1975. He was buried in a mausoleum called the Valley of the Fallen, just outside Madrid. But that site has become a shrine for the far right and is loathed by many Spaniards.\n\nSpain's socialist government wants to move Franco's remains to a less controversial site. But that plan is opposed by Franco's family and his far-right supporters. Last month, the country's top court rejected an appeal from the family and backed the government's plan.\n\nThe issue has proved highly controversial.\n\nRead the full article\n\nWhat the papers say\n\nWill there be a fresh Brexit vote and will the PM's deal get through?
