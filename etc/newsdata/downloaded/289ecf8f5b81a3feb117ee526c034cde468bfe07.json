REUTERS/Baz Ratner/File Photo\n\nNAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya\u2019s parliament should repeal a cap on commercial lending rates in line with the president\u2019s demands, the finance committee of the legislature said in a report seen by Reuters on Wednesday.\n\nPresident Uhuru Kenyatta refused to sign the government\u2019s budget for this financial year earlier this month, demanding that lawmakers repeal the cap, which has been blamed for a slowdown in private sector credit growth.\n\nThe team proposed that existing loans be shielded from any increases in rates even after the cap is repealed, according to the committee\u2019s report, which was issued late on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cAny agreement or arrangement to borrow or lend which was made... shall continue to be in force for such terms including interest rates and for the duration specified in the agreement,\u201d the committee said.\n\nThe parliament will vote on whether to accept the finance committee\u2019s recommendations next Tuesday, said Aden Duale, parliament\u2019s majority leader.\n\nLawmakers have the option of removing the cap from the bill or overruling the president if two thirds of the 349 members vote to override his position.\n\nIn 2016, the government limited rates banks can charge customers to four percentage points above the central bank\u2019s benchmark - currently 9% - saying it was concerned about high rates.\n\nBut the cap has had plenty of unintended consequences, including a reduction of loans for customers deemed as risky and the blunting of the effectiveness of monetary policy, the central bank says.", "description": "Kenya's parliament should repeal a cap on commercial lending rates in line with the president's demands, the finance committee of the legislature said in a report seen by Reuters on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446450757&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0GQ-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
