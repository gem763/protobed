All nations need a battle-ready military that can be deployed at short notice.\n\nThe military not only secures the country, it is also essential for regional stability.\n\nPeacekeeping and helping our neighbours are some of the things the South African military has excelled at since we became part of the community of nations.\n\nA crucial by-product is an active defence industry, which is a boon for cutting-edge technological development.\n\nRead: The arms deal ghost\n\nFor crying out loud, even eSwatini has a military arm. Known as the Umbutfo eSwatini Defence Force, it consists of 3 500 soldiers \u2013 fewer than the members of Cape Town\u2019s Hard Livings gang, but a defence force nevertheless.\n\nOur neighbour even has an air force comprising about nine aeroplanes, which include potent military machines such as a Cessna, a Learjet and an Airbus.\n\nIn decades past, eSwatini even had a navy \u2013 one boat that was docked at Maputo. But it apparently got lost and the entire navy was disbanded.\n\nBut we digress. The point here is that some opponents of the arms deal conflated their opposition to the corruption associated with it with the belief that the country did not need to refresh its military muscle.\n\nThe debate then got muddied as those defending the acquisition \u2013 most of them innocent \u2013 adamantly claimed that the deal was clean.\n\nThose who were involved in the purchase of jets, vessels and other equipment have said that the primary deal was aboveboard, but that there may have been corruption associated with the secondary stage that involved fittings.\n\nIf it was indeed the case that the primary level was totally clean, South Africa would have achieved a historic feat by being the first country since the existence of nation states to conclude a corruption-free arms deal.\n\nThe Seriti commission of inquiry into the deal was supposed to put paid to the argument of whether or not there was corruption associated with the primary acquisition.\n\nIt did nothing of the sort. Judge William Seriti, then a Supreme Court of Appeals jurist, shamed South Africa\u2019s highly respected judiciary by presiding over a sham of an inquiry that was designed to shore up the official narrative that the arms deal was virtuous.\n\nAFP\n\nEven someone with a brain the size of a typical Donald Trump supporter could have worked out that Seriti and his team had a mandate to achieve a predetermined outcome.\n\n\n\nThis was a great tragedy because Seriti had been a highly rated lawyer and a well-regarded judge before this process.\n\nWhat possessed him to throw away his gilded name in pursuit of a negative cause is a mystery. But throw it away he did.\n\nHistory will remember Seriti not as a fearless lawyer or a judge who made rulings that made the powerful quiver.\n\nHis name will forever be associated with the white-washing of corruption. The damning judgment that set aside the findings of the Seriti commission is the ultimate ugly blot on his name.\n\nRead out by Gauteng Judge President Dunstan Mlambo last week, the judgment from a full Bench found that the commission fell short of the objective of investigating \u201cwith an open mind to reveal the truth to the public on a matter of utmost public importance ... which had bedevilled the constitutional democracy in this country since its dawn\u201d.\n\nThere was \u201cclear failure to test evidence of key witnesses\u201d and \u201ca refusal to take account of documentary evidence which contained the most serious allegations which were relevant to its inquiry\u201d, the judges found.\n\nWhile the setting aside of the findings does not end the debate about the probity of the arms deal, it discredits those who waved it as the final word on the matter.\n\nNow that the commission has been discredited, so has the narrative that it supported.\n\nWe will most likely never fully know what really happened in smoke-filled rooms, nor will the money that changed hands be traced.\n\nIt would be foolhardy and too prohibitive to launch a new investigation.\n\nAnyway, the behaviours of Jacob Zuma and the Guptas, as well those of the many who stole from us, are much fresher in our memory.\n\nBut at least we know that, somehow, this deal made us lose our innocence.", "description": "Every South African patriot would have had their chest puffed up and a lump in their throats during the air displays at President Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s inauguration in May.", "authors": ["Mondli Makhanya"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9255/4f30f2fbb99746c29e53e41dde97cdb8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-26"}
