He\u2019s been with Breitbart for years having served as the website\u2019s in-house counsel following a failed run against Chicago Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky in 2010. He was once editor-in-chief of the website but is now a senior editor-at-large. Pollak is currently spending plenty of time in South Carolina following Democratic presidential candidates Beto O\u2019Rourke and Joe Biden\u2019s treks through the state.\n\nPollak\u2019s work on the O\u2019Rourke beat got under the skin of at least two campaign staff members enough to have a Benedict College police officer boot him from an event this week. He wrote about it, of course, generating plenty of defense from other journalists including Matthew Rosenberg and Elizabeth Williamson from The New York Times. Josh Dawsey from The Washington Post tweeted out Pollak\u2019s story and The Poynter Institute decried O\u2019Rourke\u2019s move by calling it a major mistake.It also received coverage from CNN, POLITICO, the Associated Press, and other news outlets. Breitbart fans, such as Donald Trump Jr., have filled social media with Pollak\u2019s recollection of the events. One Trump fan quipped \u201cthere would [be] none left\u201d if Trump removed Democrat reporters from his events.\n\nYet, it didn\u2019t take long for a multitude of other writers and bloggers to defend the Texas Democrat\u2019s action. One declared factual reporting was being devalued by allowing a \u201cpropaganda outlet\u201d to blend in with news organizations. Another criticized Breitbart as a \u201cglorified blog\u201d () and it was the site\u2019s \u201cgreatest trick\u201d to be considered a news site. A third cried Breitbart had been eroding American democracy for years by \u201cposing as legitimate news\u201d while a fourth accused journalists of \u201cgrotesque\u201d behavior for accepting Pollak and Breitbart in the Beltway. There was hope from a fifth that other candidates will follow O\u2019Rourke\u2019s lead.\n\nThe O\u2019Rourke campaign promised to return access to Pollak although the future will probably not contain an apology. A spokesperson declared Breitbart is on a tightrope between \u201cbeing news and a perpetrator of hate speech.\u201d The organization did promise it believed in the right to free press but desired a safe space for HBCU students to talk about sensitive issues.\n\nA friend of mine recently mentioned he believed tribalism was killing America. Another lamented the current American political scene was \u201call about the damn jersey.\u201d Michigan Congressman Justin Amash raised the same concerns when discussing leaving the Republican Party while heaping a heavy dose of scorn on Democrats. All these observations come to mind when I consider any situation involving a news entity and \u201cnot real journalism\u201d claims.\n\nThe question worth considering is whether this push from certain parties and politicians to somehow de-legitimize and deny news outlets access because of their reporting flies in the face of freedom of speech and freedom of the press in the Constitution. The next question is what the proverbial \u2018next step\u2019 might be if those who believe in ostracizing and de-legitimizing news organizations, regardless of slant, take over both parties.", "description": "A cascade of errors.", "authors": ["Taylor Millard", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Andrew Malcolm"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/beto-memememe.png"}
