With the most powerful military in the world at its side, Saudi Arabia may well be emboldened to ratchet up hostilities toward Iran \u2014 while Iran, feeling threatened by its enemy\u2019s position of strength, will become even more provocative in an attempt to prove itself a formidable adversary. For both sides, U.S. intervention fosters behavior that makes war more likely.\n\nIf mutual escalation continues, however, Washington eventually will have to choose: Do we follow through on the pledge to fight for Saudi Arabia, becoming embroiled in a major new conflict? Or do we disentangle from the region\u2019s squabbles, declining to wage war at Saudi behest after years of suggesting we would do exactly that? Neither option is good, but both can be avoided by changing course now.\n\nSaudi Arabia is unworthy of unconditional U.S. support. Like the Kurds, it is not a treaty ally of the United States \u2014 nor should it be, as its government is a brutal dictatorship well known to contribute to regional chaos, most visibly at present through its U.S.-enabled war in Yemen. Unlike the Kurds, it is a wealthy state perfectly capable of handling its own defense. Rather than deploying more American forces to protect an oppressive regime that has no obligation to do the same for us, Trump should finally make good on his many promises to bring U.S. soldiers home.", "description": "", "authors": ["Bonnie Kristian", "Theweek.Com Articles Trump-Recreating-Americas-Syria-Dilemma--Saudi-Arabia"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
