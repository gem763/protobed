The business is one of thousands trapped in entrenched drought across much of eastern Australia, with many preparing for drastic action to survive.\n\n\u201cI've gone back to old-style farming,\u201d Hayes says. \u201cIt's digging up between the rows, removing all of the weeds, reducing the bud numbers on the vines to lower the crop load and waiting for the God pump to kick in.\n\n\u201cThat's Mother Nature and rainfall arriving.\u201d\n\nLike so many others working on or around the land while 95 per cent of NSW and two-thirds of Queensland is in long-running drought, Hayes says he\u2019s in \u201csurvival mode\u201d.\n\n\"I'm trying to have the glass at 55 per cent full but probably deep down I know if I don't get sufficient rainfall over the next four to five weeks ... we may have an 80 to 100 per cent loss for the vintage this year.\u201d\n\nSeen it all before\n\nTo say Hayes is unimpressed with news of a regional drought tour by federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and senior Coalition MPs this week would be an understatement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlongside Nationals minister David Littleproud, Frydenberg visited Stanthorpe and Warwick in Queensland, and Inverell in northern NSW, hearing first-hand how primary producers, businesses and community leaders are holding up.\n\nHayes has seen it all before.\n\n\u201cThey'll come in their flash RM Williams and their Akubras and their imported polo shirts from France, thinking they're super cool.\n\n\u201cI'd like to get them out in the vineyard and spend a couple of days working, tasting and eating the dust, facing extreme temperatures we haven't seen before. It might just wake a few of these politicians up.\u201d\n\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg, orchard owner Dino Rizzato and Drought Minister David Littleproud in a dried up dam at Cottonvale apple orchard, outside Stanthorpe south-west of Brisbane. AAP\n\nHe\u2019s not exaggerating. The most recent drought analysis by the Bureau of Meteorology shows rainfall remains painfully below average in the eastern states, as well as in South Australia and parts of northern Tasmania.\n\nA total lack of meaningful rainfall has persisted and root zone soil moisture is well below average for most of the country.\n\nThe tour has included stops at bone-dry paddocks, struggling businesses and the federally funded Emu Swamp Dam project in south-east Queensland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt every stop, locals tell the city visitors more financial assistance is badly needed. The Coalition has a $7 billion drought package, and last week announced another $100 million in funding, which included extending and simplifying the farm household allowance, a welfare payment some farmers have been reluctant to take up.\n\nMore than 100 local councils will receive $1 million grants and money is going to low-interest loans, non-profits and financial counselling services.\n\nFor Mike Hayes, the entire federal budget won't be enough if the Coalition keeps avoiding the existential elephant in the room.\n\n\"This is a direct impact of climate change. I don't care what anybody says.

If we farmed like our forefathers did, we would have been broke years ago. \u2014 Peter Mailler, farmer\n\nAfter years of drought, Australia\u2019s agriculture sector is growing smaller along with the amount of land used for primary production.\n\nBureau of Statistics data show there were 85,000 agricultural businesses in Australia at the start of the financial year, a drop of 3 per cent from June 2017.\n\nAs farmers say each successive year of drought gets harder, about 378 million hectares of land is being used for agriculture in Australia, a drop of 4 per cent in two years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome 85 per cent of farm income comes from production, with 11 per cent from off-farm employment or other business, and 0.6 per cent from grants, government transfers and relief funding.\n\nSo far, just over a third of eligible households are accessing the expanded farm household allowance payment, a signal the clunky application process and pride could be getting in the way of immediate financial support.\n\nFrydenberg stressed dollars and data during his visit but conceded he was in the region to listen to ideas for future assistance by the government.\n\nHe has been visibly moved by the stories locals have told him, including farms going to the wall and another three suicides in one small area in recent months.\n\n'It's not a normal event'\n\nLike so many others, Peter Mailler is thinking about both immediate help and longer-term planning.\n\n\"At some point you must recognise that what we're dealing with is not able to be mitigated through normal strategies.\n\n\u201cIt's not a normal event.

The window dressing and positioning around drought and drought policy in Australia is actually startling.\u201d\n\nOnly good fortune is helping his farm get through 2019, he says.\n\nNationals member for New England Barnaby Joyce, left.

AAP\n\n\u201cWe were lucky to get under a single fall of rain in March that made the difference but there are better farmers than me who have done everything right, who will make significant losses this year, just because they weren't lucky enough to be on the edge of a storm.\u201d\n\nAcross the border in Inverell, off-farm realities are changing because of drought. In November, the Target store will close, a signal local cafe owner Jenny Thomas dreads.\n\n\u201cSince we heard that, the morale has dropped a bit again,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn small towns you have Target, you have Big W.

Thomas works seven days herself and says locals are still finding the money for a cup of coffee.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hard slog already. The spend is down. The foot traffic is still coming in but they're not spending as much and they might not come in once every fortnight. I might see them once every three months now.\u201d\n\nWith a cheerful smile, she says the state and federal governments should focus on nickel and dime ways to help struggling communities.\n\n\u201cI thought opening a cafe five-and-a-half years ago was a good idea but it's very stressful.\u201d\n\nMore frequent and severe\n\nEconomists say over the past 50 years, Australia\u2019s real gross farm product has declined by about 27.5 per cent during droughts, with leaner production methods and technology helping create a smaller decline in agricultural output during the current dry.\n\nImproved weather forecasting and irrigation also help but droughts are becoming more frequent and more severe in Australia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrade figures released on Thursday showed strong beef exports, as producers turn off more stock because of the dry. Wheat exports were down, at about $213 million, in August \u2013 the third-worst result for the month in the past two decades. The only two worse totals were both in periods of drought.\n\nAt each stop on the tour, Frydenberg has faced questions about the lack of a co-ordinated national drought policy. Labor has asked the Auditor-General to probe the veracity of the claimed $7 billion price tag for spending from Canberra.\n\nJosh Frydenberg and David Littleproud with farmers in Stanthorpe, Queensland. AAP\n\nThe Treasurer sees no disconnect between the government's policies on drought and effective action to mitigate damaging climate change, stressing Australia's role in the global community.\n\n\"We accept the science around climate change. We accept that it is part of what is happening here today.\n\n\"We've had droughts in the past in this nation, very severe ones ... droughts are not new, but the severity of this drought is the worst in living memory and we do accept that the climate is changing and man is contributing to that. The science has told us that.\"\n\nImminent exhaustion of water\n\nFor Stanthorpe, which faced serious bushfires just weeks ago, more immediate problems persist. Facing the imminent exhaustion of its water supply, about $800,000 per month is going to be spent to truck in 34 truckloads of water per day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt times, the emotional impact of the situation here has shown on Frydenberg's face. A long way from inner-city Kooyong, the message has been received.\n\nHe read letters written by struggling families in Inverell and was visibly moved by stories about what the lack of rain has done to everyday life.\n\nOne letter said the loss of time had been the hardest thing.\n\n\"Time to do what we used to do before carting feed and water took over,\" the Treasurer read.\n\n\"We used to enjoy riding our horses and going places but now we cannot go anywhere. As soon as we do, a cow will get stuck in the mud that used to be a dam. The horses, who are part of our family, look at us every day for more food.\n\n\"The children work hard to help us, instead of doing homework or downtime.
