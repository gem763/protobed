Please help.\n\nRead more: My boyfriend won't forgive me for cheating \u2013 how do I win him back\n\nAnswer\n\nIt must be disheartening being treated like you don\u2019t exist or like you don\u2019t matter. Your man\u2019s actions are saying a lot that he\u2019s not saying verbally. It\u2019s time to sit him down and ask him why he\u2019s acting in this manner.\n\nHe needs to understand that quality time is not only about spending time in bed together making love. Quality time should include other activities that you enjoy doing together as a couple.\n\nThese can range from simple ones that are of no monetary value to things you have to pay for. No matter how busy he is building his career, he needs to dedicate time to you and to strengthening and nurturing your relationship.\n\nTake the time to speak to him about this, but make sure you don\u2019t sound as if you\u2019re accusing him of anything as this might make matters worse.\n\nJust explain that you have concerns about your relationship because of what happens when you\u2019re visiting him. Tell him how that makes you feel.\n\nEverydayknow.com suggests that when your boyfriend has never made time for you in the entire relationship, your best bet is to just talk to him about it.\n\nIn many cases, the boyfriend does not even realize how his behaviour is perceived. He may be used to being a single guy who gets to go to work, hang out with friends and spend most of his free time relaxing.\n\nHe also may be afraid of seeming needy by asking you to spend time with him every day. Whatever the reason, there is an excellent chance that he has no clue how you feel. The only way that he will ever figure out how you feel about this is if you talk to him about it.", "description": "Sis Dolly answers some of the burning questions from our readers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9493/0c742f137c824e7d9843ef02a8922d26.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
