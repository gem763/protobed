After all, that money\u2014or at least the interest on it\u2014will have to come out of workers\u2019 paychecks, leaving them with less money to spend on everything else.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nMuch less recognized is America\u2019s hidden pension, or retirement, debts. That hidden debt is the money that workers across the country have been told will they will receive in retirement\u2014money that, all too often, simply is not there.\n\nSocial Security is the most obvious of America\u2019s pension debts. The program has $13.9 trillion in unfunded obligations over the next 75 years. Fifteen years from now, when its notional trust fund runs dry, all retirees will receive about a 25 percent benefit cut.\n\nFor the average Social Security recipient, a loss of $4,200 per year in income would be a significant financial hit.\n\nUnfortunately, the retirement outlook is drastically worse for private union workers and state and local government employees. On average, their pension funds are only 43 percent and 35 percent funded, respectively.\n\nMultiemployer pensions have promised $638 billion more than they\u2019ve set aside to pay their retirees. State and local pension plans are short between $4 trillion and $6 trillion.\n\nA private union member with a $24,000 pension, could lose $14,000.\n\nState and local workers could be even worse off. Some of those funds have mere pennies on the dollar on hand to pay promised benefits.\n\nIf Congress doesn\u2019t act to improve Social Security and multiemployer pensions, benefit cuts kick in. But if state and local policymakers fail to reform their underfunded pensions, taxpayers will almost certainly pick up the tab because, in most states, retired workers receive their pensions before active workers get paid.\n\nThe pension-tax-hikes won\u2019t be small. On average, pension underfunding amounts to between $12,200 and $18,300 per resident.\n\nSuch high tax increases could send some states into an economic death spiral. In Illinois, California and Connecticut, for example, per-capita unfunded pension burdens are $29,000 or higher. That\u2019s about $120,000 in additional taxes for a family of four.\n\nRelying on tax increases alone to cover state and local pension shortfalls would almost certainly cause workers and businesses to flee the high-tax states, leaving them with an even smaller revenue base to pay for their unfunded pensions.\n\nRelying on tax increases\u2014through Congress\u2019s proposed bailout\u2014to shore up private union pensions would wrongly penalize taxpayers and the majority of companies that do not participate in union-run pension plans\n\nSimilarly, relying on tax increases to shore up Social Security would dampen our economy and lower working families\u2019 incomes. An analysis by Drew Gonshorowski and I shows that workers of all income levels would be significantly worse off if Congress relies on tax increases to solve Social Security. And this is true even if Congress also raises Social Security benefits.\n\nMoreover, the economy would suffer significantly if policymakers rely on tax increases to solve Social Security\u2019s shortfalls. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School of Business looked at two proposals to address the problem: the Social Security 2100 Act, which would raise Social Security taxes and benefits, and a more targeted reform that included cost-saving measures such as gradually raising the retirement age, reducing benefits to well-off retirees, and lowering cost-of-living adjustments. They found that the economy would be 7.3% larger with the latter, smaller Social Security program.\n\nHow is that so? As former Social Security Principal Deputy Commissioner Andrew Biggs explains: \u201cThe logic is straightforward: when taxes go up people work less; when Social Security benefits go up, people save less. If people work less and save less, the economy grows more slowly.\n\nAmerica\u2019s largely hidden and yet-to-be fully realized retirement income shortfalls are on par with the size of our country\u2019s public debt.\n\nWhile the consequences of failing to recognize and address those massive deficits would be devastating\u2014for retirees, workers, and the entire economy\u2014the good news is that there are solutions. And those solutions\u2014the economically constructive ones\u2014do not include bailouts, massive pension losses, or tax increases.\n\nCommonsense changes to union pension plans can prevent employers and unions from breaking their pension promises, and a properly-managed pension insurance agency can minimize pension losses.\n\nState and local governments can overcome the inherent conflict between short-sighted political interests and long-term pension promises by shifting to defined-contribution retirement benefits that require immediate funding.\n\nAmericans can cushion potential retirement shortfalls by capitalizing on improved health outcomes and life expectancies that mean most individuals can work years longer than previous generations.\n\nAnd Congress can return Social Security to its original roots by shifting benefits from upper-income earners to lower-income earners while letting everyone keep more of their hard-earned paychecks.\n\nRachel Greszler is a research fellow in economics, budget and entitlements for The Heritage Foundation.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM FOX BUSINESS", "description": "America\u2019s largely hidden and yet-to-be fully realized retirement income shortfalls are on par with the size of our country\u2019s public debt.", "authors": ["Rachel Greszler"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Greszler_Rachel.png?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
