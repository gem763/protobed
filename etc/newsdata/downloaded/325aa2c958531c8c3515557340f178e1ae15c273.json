In a press release announcing the launch of the beta, Samsung says that the new version of Android includes redesigned smaller notifications, an \u201cenhanced Dark Mode,\u201d and other Android 10 features such as Focus Mode.\n\nSamsung\u2019s press release doesn\u2019t say exactly which countries are getting the beta, but SamMobile reports that it should be available in South Korea, Germany, and the US. You can find out if you have access by heading into the Samsung Members app and looking for a notification about the beta. Samsung says the beta will be available for Galaxy S10E, S10, S10 Plus, and S10 5G devices. As always, however, you should be careful about installing beta software on anything you rely on as a primary device.\n\nThe South Korean electronics giant has traditionally been slow at bringing the latest version of Android to its devices. Last year it didn\u2019t open its Android 9 beta until mid-November, and the software didn\u2019t start releasing until January of the following year. In this context, a mid-October release is a much quicker turnaround for Samsung, even if it comes a month and a half after Android 10 was released.", "description": "Samsung has released a beta version of Android 10 for Galaxy S10 devices, including the S10E, S10 Plus, and S10 5G.
