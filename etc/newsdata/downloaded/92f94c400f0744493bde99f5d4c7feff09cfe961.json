Arrivals and offtake too remained at a low ebb and volume of business poor because of heavy rains in the region. Absence of demand from millers mainly kept major oil prices unchanged. No trader was in mood for any commitment, adopting `wait and watch' move, according to sources.\n\n***** VIDARBHA MARKETS OILS\n\n* Soyabean, cottonseed, groundnut loose, groundnut refined, sunflower refined, linseed,\n\nrapeseed, castor and coconut KP oil ruled steady here in weak trading activity.\n\n* Traders expect nearly steady trend in major edible oils here.\n\nSOYMEAL\n\n* Soymeal prices today quoted static here on lack of demand from local traders.\n\nSOYABEAN\n\n* Soyabean prices recovered again in Nagpur Agriculture Produce Marketing\n\nCommittee (APMC) on good buying support from local crushing plants amid thin\n\nsupply from producing regions because of heavy rains.
