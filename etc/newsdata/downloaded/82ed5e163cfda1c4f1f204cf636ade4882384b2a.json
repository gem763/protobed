It promises way better battery life than a laptop and runs most of the same apps, with LTE support to always keep you connected, although the size and weight come at the expense of things like a headphone jack. In short, it promises to be that mythical holy grail that can bridge the gap between a phone and a full-fledged laptop.\n\nI\u2019m talking, of course, about Microsoft\u2019s newly announced Surface Pro X. Or is it Apple\u2019s iPad Pro?\n\nBut while the two devices sound similar in concept, they represent two very different ideas of what this category of device should be. The iPad Pro is an iOS device that\u2019s been elevated to do more than an iPhone, thanks to a larger display, a keyboard, a stylus, its own operating system, and even mouse support (sort of). Frankly, the iPad Pro was a clear response to Microsoft\u2019s Surface Pro, which popularized the idea of adding a detachable keyboard and stylus to a powerful tablet so you could work done with a slate.\n\nNow, Microsoft\u2019s new response to the iPad Pro \u2014 in the Surface Pro X \u2014 in turn looks towards the iPad\u2019s strengths by distilling the Windows 10 experience down to a more portable and mobile-friendly form that borrows features like better battery life, instantly resumable work, a slimmer form factor, and ARM-based processors.\n\nThere are obvious differences here: the Surface Pro X is a more traditional PC. It has a user replaceable SSD, multiple USB-C ports, and it\u2019ll run plenty of familiar apps like Office and Chrome exactly like you\u2019d expect if you were coming from a more traditional laptop. There\u2019s more user control over what you can install and how you\u2019ll use it, especially compared to the notoriously locked-down iPadOS (n\u00e9e iOS). It has a trackpad and a mouse.\n\nMicrosoft is promising up to 13 hours of battery life, compared to the iPad Pro\u2019s 10 hours. The Surface Pro X also features a larger 13-inch display, although it\u2019s similar in size and thickness to Apple\u2019s larger model.\n\nThe future of computing also isn\u2019t cheap, no matter who you buy it from: the Surface Pro X starts at $999. The Type Cover and Surface Pens are sold separately, for $139.99 and $144.99, respectively, or you can buy them in a bundle for $269.99. That\u2019s a total of $1,268.99 for the full Surface Pro X experience.\n\nIt\u2019s still too early to say how the fight will shake out\n\nApple\u2019s iPad Pro is similarly pricey, starting at $799 for the smaller screen and $999 for the Surface Pro X-sized model. The Apple Pencil is another $129 on top, while Apple\u2019s Smart Keyboard costs either $179 or $199, depending on your tablet\u2019s size, which shakes out to either $1,098 or $1,327 to start. All told, you can easily pay as much as a comparable \u201creal\u201d laptop from either Apple or Microsoft as you can on their more mobile-focused alternatives.\n\nIt\u2019s still too early to say how the fight will shake out: iPadOS is brand-new and has a lot to prove when it comes to turning an iPad into a main computer. And there\u2019s still some big question marks as to whether Microsoft\u2019s new SQ1 processor can actually keep pace, especially given the past failures of ARM Windows devices (like the original Surface RT, for instance). It\u2019s the same question at its core: can you rely on the iPad Pro or Surface Pro X to replace your laptop all the time, instead of just most of it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a computer?\u201d is the question Apple\u2019s infamous iPad commercial asked two years ago, setting off a still ongoing debate across the internet about the future of portable PCs. A year later, the Surface Pro X is Microsoft\u2019s clear response. Whether either of them really do have the right answer to that question remains to be seen.", "description": "Microsoft\u2019s newly announced Surface Pro X checks a lot of boxes for a mobile laptop: long battery life, mobile processor, LTE, and more.
