The road is meant to highlight Baku\u2019s recent modernization, and it is lined with sleek new buildings. The Heydar Aliyev Center, an undulating wave of concrete and glass, was designed by Zaha Hadid. The state oil company is housed in a twisting glass tower, and the headquarters of the state water company looks like a giant water droplet. \u201cIt\u2019s like Potemkin,\u201d my translator told me. \u201cIt\u2019s only the buildings right next to the road.\u201d Behind the gleaming structures stand decaying Soviet-era apartment blocks, with clothes hanging out of windows and wallboards exposed by fallen brickwork. As you approach the city center, a tower at the end of the avenue looms in front of you. Thirty-three stories high and curved to resemble a sail, the building was clearly inspired by the Burj Al Arab Hotel, in Dubai, but it is boxier and less elegant. When I visited Baku, in December, five enormous white letters glowed at the top of the tower: T-R-U-M-P. The building, a five-star hotel and residence called the Trump International Hotel & Tower Baku, has never opened, though from the road it looks ready to welcome the public. Reaching the property is surprisingly difficult; the tower stands amid a welter of on-ramps, off-ramps, and overpasses. During the nine days I was in town, I went to the site half a dozen times, and on each occasion I had a comical exchange with a taxi-driver who had no idea which combination of turns would lead to the building\u2019s entrance. The more time I spent in the neighborhood, the more I wondered how the hotel could have been imagined as a viable business. The development was conceived, in 2008, as a high-end apartment building. In 2012, after Donald Trump\u2019s company, the Trump Organization, signed multiple contracts with the Azerbaijani developers behind the project, plans were made to transform the tower into an \u201cultra-luxury property.\u201d According to a Trump Organization press release, a hotel with \u201cexpansive guest rooms\u201d would occupy the first thirteen floors; higher stories would feature residences with \u201cspectacular views of the city and Caspian Sea.\u201d For an expensive hotel, the Trump Tower Baku is in an oddly unglamorous location: the underdeveloped eastern end of downtown, which is dominated by train tracks and is miles from the main business district, on the west side of the city. Across the street from the hotel is a discount shopping center; the area is filled with narrow, dingy shops and hookah bars. Other hotels nearby are low-budget options: at the AYF Palace, most rooms are forty-two dollars a night. There are no upscale restaurants or shops. Any guests of the Trump Tower Baku would likely feel marooned. The timing of the project was also curious. By 2014, when the Trump Organization publicly announced that it was helping to turn the tower into a hotel, a construction boom in Baku had ended, and the occupancy rate for luxury hotels in the city hovered around thirty-five per cent. Jan deRoos, of Cornell University, who is an expert in hotel finance, told me that the developer of a five-star hotel typically must demonstrate that the project will maintain an average occupancy rate of at least sixty per cent for ten years. There is a long-term master plan to develop the area around the Trump Tower Baku, but if it is implemented the hotel will be surrounded for years by noisy construction projects, making it even less appealing to travellers desiring a luxurious experience\u2014especially considering that there are many established hotels on the city\u2019s seaside promenade. There, an executive from ExxonMobil or the Israeli cell-phone industry can stay at the Four Seasons, which occupies a limestone building that evokes a French colonial palace, or at the J. W. Marriott Absheron Baku, which has an outdoor terrace overlooking the water. Tiffany, Ralph Lauren, and Armani are among the dozens of companies that have boutiques along the promenade. A former top official in Azerbaijan\u2019s Ministry of Tourism says that, when he learned of the Trump hotel project, he asked himself, \u201cWhy would someone put a luxury hotel there? Nobody who can afford to stay there would want to be in that neighborhood.\u201d The Azerbaijanis behind the project were close relatives of Ziya Mammadov, the Transportation Minister and one of the country\u2019s wealthiest and most powerful oligarchs. According to the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index, Azerbaijan is among the most corrupt nations in the world. Its President, Ilham Aliyev, the son of the former President Heydar Aliyev, recently appointed his wife to be Vice-President. Ziya Mammadov became the Transportation Minister in 2002, around the time that the regime began receiving enormous profits from government-owned oil reserves in the Caspian Sea. At the time of the hotel deal, Mammadov, a career government official, had a salary of about twelve thousand dollars, but he was a billionaire. The Trump Tower Baku originally had a construction budget of a hundred and ninety-five million dollars, but it went through multiple revisions, and the cost ended up being much higher. The tower was designed by a local architect, and in its original incarnation it had an ungainly roof that suggested the spikes of a crown. A London-based architecture firm, Mixity, redesigned the building, softening its edges and eliminating the ornamental roof. By the time the Trump team officially joined the project, in May, 2012, many condominium residences had already been completed; at the insistence of Trump Organization staffers, most of the building\u2019s interior was gutted and rebuilt, and several elevators were added. After Donald Trump became a candidate for President, in 2015, Mother Jones, the Associated Press, the Washington Post, and other publications ran articles that raised questions about his involvement in the Baku project. These reports cited a series of cables sent from the U.S. Embassy in Azerbaijan in 2009 and 2010, which were made public by WikiLeaks. In one of the cables, a U.S. diplomat described Ziya Mammadov as \u201cnotoriously corrupt even for Azerbaijan.\u201d The Trump Organization\u2019s chief legal officer, Alan Garten, told reporters that the Baku hotel project raised no ethical issues for Donald Trump, because his company had never engaged directly with Mammadov. According to Garten, Trump played a passive role in the development of the property: he was \u201cmerely a licensor\u201d who allowed his famous name to be used by a company headed by Ziya Mammadov\u2019s son, Anar, a young entrepreneur. It\u2019s not clear how much money Trump made from the licensing agreement, although in his limited public filings he has reported receiving $2.8 million. (The Trump Organization shared documents that showed an additional payment of two and a half million dollars, in 2012, but declined to disclose any other payments.) Trump also had signed a contract to manage the hotel once it opened, for an undisclosed fee tied to the hotel\u2019s performance. The Washington Post published Garten\u2019s description of the deal, and reported that Donald Trump had \u201cinvested virtually no money in the project while selling the rights to use his name and holding the contract to manage the property.\u201d A month after Trump was elected President, Garten announced that the Trump Organization had severed its ties with the hotel project, describing the decision to CNN as little more than \u201chousecleaning.\u201d I was in Baku at the time, and it had become clear that the Trump Organization\u2019s story of the hotel was incomplete and inaccurate. Trump\u2019s company had made the deal not just with Anar Mammadov but also with Ziya\u2019s brother Elton\u2014an influential member of the Azerbaijani parliament. Elton signed the contracts, and in an interview he confirmed that he founded Baku XXI Century, the company that owns the Trump Tower Baku. When he was asked who owns Baku XXI Century, he called it a \u201ccommercial secret\u201d but added that he \u201ccontrolled all its operations\u201d until 2015, when he cut ties to the company. Elton denied having used his political position for profit. An Azerbaijani lawyer who worked on the project revealed to me that the Trump Organization had not just licensed the family name; it also had signed a technical-services agreement in which it promised to help its partner meet Trump design standards. Technical-services agreements are often nominal addenda to licensing deals. Major hospitality brands compile exhaustive specifications for licensed hotels, and tend to approve design elements remotely; a foreign site is visited only occasionally. But in the case of Trump Tower Baku the oversight appears to have been extensive. The Azerbaijani lawyer told me, \u201cWe were always following their instructions. We were in constant contact with the Trump Organization. They approved the smallest details.\u201d He said that Trump staff visited Baku at least monthly to give the go-ahead for the next round of work orders. Trump designers went to Turkey to vet the furniture and fabrics acquired there. The hotel\u2019s main designer, Pierre Baillargeon, and several contractors told me that they had visited the Trump Organization headquarters, in New York, to secure approval for their plans. Ivanka Trump was the most senior Trump Organization official on the Baku project. In October, 2014, she visited the city to tour the site and offer advice. An executive at Mace, the London-based construction firm that oversaw the tower\u2019s conversion to a hotel, met with Ivanka in Baku and New York. He told me, \u201cShe had very strong feelings, not just about the design but about the back of the hotel\u2014landscaping, everything.\u201d The Azerbaijani lawyer said, \u201cIvanka personally approved everything.\u201d A subcontractor noted that Ivanka\u2019s team was particular about wood panelling: it chose an expensive Macassar ebony, from Indonesia, for the ceiling of the lobby. The ballroom doors were to be made of book-matched panels of walnut. On her Web site, Ivanka posted a photograph of herself wearing a hard hat inside the half-completed hotel. A caption reads, \u201cIvanka has overseen the development of Trump International Hotel & Tower Baku since its inception, and she recently returned from a trip to the fascinating city in Azerbaijan to check in on the project\u2019s progress.\u201d (Ivanka Trump declined requests to discuss the Baku project.) Jan deRoos, the Cornell professor, developed branded-hotel properties before entering academia. He told me that the degree of the Trump Organization\u2019s involvement in the Baku property was atypical. \u201cThat\u2019s very, very intense,\u201d he said. The sustained back-and-forth between the Trump Organization and the Mammadovs has legal significance. If parties involved in the Trump Tower Baku project participated in any illegal financial conduct, and if the Trump Organization exerted a degree of control over the project, the company could be vulnerable to criminal prosecution. Tom Fox, a Houston lawyer who specializes in anti-corruption compliance, said, \u201cIt\u2019s a problem if you\u2019re making a profit off of someone else\u2019s corrupt conduct.\u201d Moreover, recent case law has established that licensors take on a greater legal burden when they assume roles normally reserved for developers. The Trump Organization\u2019s unusually deep engagement with Baku XXI Century suggests that it had the opportunity and the responsibility to monitor it for corruption. Before signing a deal with a foreign partner, American companies, including major hotel chains, conduct risk assessments and background checks that take a close look at the country, the prospective partner, and the people involved. Countless accounting and law firms perform this service, as do many specialized investigation companies; a baseline report normally costs between ten thousand and twenty-five thousand dollars. A senior executive at one of the largest American hotel chains, who asked for anonymity because he feared reprisal from the Trump Administration, said, \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t look at due diligence as a burden. There certainly is a cost to doing it, especially in higher-risk places. But it\u2019s as much an investment in the protection of that brand. It\u2019s money well spent.\u201d Alan Garten told me that the Trump Organization had commissioned a risk assessment for the Baku deal, but declined to name the company that had performed it. The Washington Post article on the Baku project reported that, according to Garten, the Trump Organization had undertaken \u201cextensive due diligence\u201d before making the hotel deal and had not discovered \u201cany red flags.\u201d But the Mammadov family, in addition to its reputation for corruption, has a troubling connection that any proper risk assessment should have unearthed: for years, it has been financially entangled with an Iranian family tied to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, the ideologically driven military force. In 2008, the year that the tower was announced, Ziya Mammadov, in his role as Transportation Minister, awarded a series of multimillion-dollar contracts to Azarpassillo, an Iranian construction company. Keyumars Darvishi, its chairman, fought in the Iran-Iraq War. After the war, he became the head of Raman, an Iranian construction firm that is controlled by the Revolutionary Guard. The U.S. government has regularly accused the Guard of criminal activity, including drug trafficking, sponsoring terrorism abroad, and money laundering. Reuters recently reported that the Trump Administration was poised to officially condemn the Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization. I asked Garten how deeply the Trump Organization had looked into the Mammadov family\u2019s political connections. Had it been concerned that Elton Mammadov, as a sitting member of parliament, might exploit his power to benefit the project? How much money had Ziya Mammadov invested in Elton\u2019s company? Garten noted that he didn\u2019t oversee the due-diligence process. \u201cThe people who did are no longer at the company,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what was done in this situation.\u201d He would not identify the former employees. When I asked him to provide documentation of due diligence, he said that he couldn\u2019t share it with me, because \u201cit\u2019s confidential and privileged.\u201d A 2014 Instagram post of Ivanka Trump at the Baku tower. Photo Illustration by The New Yorker Photo Illustration by The New Yorker\n\nNo evidence has surfaced showing that Donald Trump, or any of his employees involved in the Baku deal, actively participated in bribery, money laundering, or other illegal behavior. But the Trump Organization may have broken the law in its work with the Mammadov family. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, passed in 1977, forbade American companies from participating in a scheme to reward a foreign government official in exchange for material benefit or preferential treatment. The law even made it a crime for an American company to unknowingly benefit from a partner\u2019s corruption if it could have discovered illicit activity but avoided doing so. This closed what was known as the \u201chead in the sand\u201d loophole. As a result, American companies must examine potential foreign partners very carefully before making deals with them. I recently spoke with Alexandra Wrage, who runs Trace International, a consortium of three hundred corporations that do business overseas. Trace helps these firms avoid violating the F.C.P.A., and it has a division that can be hired by individual clients to assess potential foreign partners. To comply with the law, Wrage noted, an American company must remain vigilant even after a contract is signed, monitoring its foreign partner to be sure that nobody involved is engaging in bribery or other improprieties. Wrage pointed out that corrupt government leaders often use their children or their siblings to distance themselves from illicit projects. Such an official creates a company in the relative\u2019s name which appears to be independent but is controlled by the official. To lessen the likelihood of an F.C.P.A. violation when working with a company that is owned by a child or a sibling of a government minister, Wrage told me, \u201cyou\u2019d need to show that the child has real expertise, real ability to do the work.\u201d Otherwise, Wrage said, \u201cthe assumption is that they are a partner entirely because of their ability to use their parent\u2019s power.\u201d Before Elton Mammadov became a member of parliament, in 2000, he was a maintenance engineer who had no experience in real-estate development. When the Trump Organization joined the Baku project, it barred a Mammadov-owned company from doing construction work, because it was deemed incompetent. Wrage said that a U.S. company looking to make a deal with a foreign partner should be confident that the partner has a reasonable likelihood of making a profit from the venture. If the project seems almost guaranteed to lose money, it could well be a bribery scheme or some other criminal operation. The partner also should uphold modern accounting standards. \u201cIt\u2019s simple,\u201d she said. \u201cWill money flow through this business because it offers a compelling product at a decent price, or will the money come because of an illicit relationship with someone who uses their power?\u201d Wrage told me that, in 2009, an American entrepreneur was successfully prosecuted for his part in a corruption conspiracy in Azerbaijan. Frederic Bourke, the co-founder of Dooney & Bourke, the handbag company, had invested in a project in which a foreign partner paid bribes to Azerbaijani government officials and their family members. Bourke was sentenced to a year in prison for violating the F.C.P.A.; he appealed the conviction, claiming ignorance of the corruption. Two years later, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the conviction, saying that, regardless of whether he had known about the bribes, \u201cthe testimony at trial demonstrated that Bourke was aware of how pervasive corruption was in Azerbaijan.\u201d The F.C.P.A., they said, also criminalized \u201cconscious avoidance\u201d\u2014a deliberate effort to remain in the dark about any transgressions a foreign partner might be involved in. After Bourke\u2019s conviction, Wrage said, U.S. companies were well aware of the dangers of making careless deals in Azerbaijan. Even a cursory look at the Mammadovs suggests that they are not ideal partners for an American business. Four years before the Trump Organization announced the Baku deal, WikiLeaks released the U.S. diplomatic cables indicating that the family was corrupt; one cable mentioned the Mammadovs\u2019 link to Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard. In 2013, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project investigated the Mammadov family\u2019s corruption and published well-documented expos\u00e9s. Six months before the hotel announcement, Foreign Policy ran an article titled \u201cThe Corleones of the Caspian,\u201d which suggested that the Mammadovs had exploited Ziya\u2019s position as Transportation Minister to make their fortunes. The Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty investigation revealed that Baku XXI Century, the company controlled by Elton, had at least two other stakeholders. One of them was a company called zqan, an acronym for the family members of the Transportation Minister: Ziya Mammadov; Qanira, his wife; Anar, his son; and Nigar, his daughter. Anar is the official head of zqan. Another stakeholder in Baku XXI Century was the Baghlan Group, a company run by an Azerbaijani businessman who is known to be close to Ziya Mammadov. Baku XXI Century, zqan, and Baghlan have so many overlapping interests that they often seem to operate as a single concern. According to the Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty investigation, the companies all prospered largely through contracts with the Transportation Ministry. The Trump Tower Baku complex was built partly on land controlled by the ministry. A Baghlan subsidiary received a contract from the ministry to import a thousand London-style cabs to Baku. Soon afterward, ministry inspectors began preventing competing taxi services from parking in the city center or at subway stops. Another new rule required all taxi owners to pay taxes and license fees at the Bank of Azerbaijan, a private entity that at the time was owned jointly by Anar Mammadov and Baghlan. Anar\u2019s net worth has been estimated at a billion dollars, but he is not a self-made man. According to the Associated Press, zqan was founded in 2000, when he was in his late teens. He began studying in England that year, and remained there until 2005; during that period, the company that he ostensibly ran experienced explosive growth. Trump Organization officials, as well as others familiar with the Baku project, told me that during the tower\u2019s construction Anar was barely involved, and was often travelling abroad. (He flies on a Gulfstream G450 private jet.) An American who did business in Azerbaijan told me, \u201cIt\u2019s common knowledge there that Ziya Mammadov controls zqan.\u201d One of the cables sent in 2010 by the U.S. Embassy in Baku noted that, \u201cwith so much of the nation\u2019s oil wealth being poured into road construction,\u201d the Mammadovs had become disproportionately powerful in Azerbaijan. Another cable suggested that Ziya controlled zqan, the country\u2019s \u201clargest commercial development company.\u201d This cable described Ziya as being the object of \u201cmany allegations from Azerbaijani contacts of creative corrupt practices.\u201d\n\nMuch of the land occupied by the Trump Tower Baku complex was once packed with houses. In 2011, residents received letters from the local government authority informing them that their homes were to be demolished to make way for a project of crucial government significance. Thirty families were evicted. One resident, Minaye Azizova, told me that the government gave her eighteen thousand dollars in compensation for a home that, by her estimation, was worth five times as much. After she discovered that her home had been condemned so that Baku XXI Century could build a luxury tower, she sued the government. \u201cTurns out the sound of the squeaky toy was coming from inside the house.\u201d Construction of the building began in 2008. I have spoken with more than a dozen contractors who worked on it. Some of them described behavior that seemed nakedly corrupt. Frank McDonald, an Englishman who has had a long career doing construction jobs in developing countries, performed extensive work on the building\u2019s interior. He told me that his firm was always paid in cash, and that he witnessed other contractors being paid in the same way. At the offices of Anar Mammadov\u2019s company, he said, \u201cthey would give us a giant pile of cash,\u201d adding, \u201cI got a hundred and eighty thousand dollars one time, which I fit into my laptop bag, and two hundred thousand dollars another time.\u201d Once, a colleague of his picked up a payment of two million dollars. \u201cHe needed to bring a big duffelbag,\u201d McDonald recalled. The Azerbaijani lawyer confirmed that some contractors on the Baku tower were paid in cash. Two people who worked on the Trump Tower Baku told me that bribes were paid. Much of the graft was routine: Azerbaijani tax officials, government inspectors, and customs officers showed up occasionally to pick up envelopes of cash. The executive at Mace, the construction firm, told me that the Mammadovs handled payments and all interactions with the Azerbaijani government. \u201cWere people bribed?\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe. We didn\u2019t check.\u201d (A spokesman for Mace said that the firm was \u201cnot involved\u201d in any corruption.) Pierre Baillargeon, the architect whom the Mammadovs hired to alter the tower\u2019s original design, is a Canadian who runs a studio in London. He has often worked in parts of the world known for corruption, including Sudan and Syria, and has done several projects in Azerbaijan. In a phone interview, Baillargeon said that he knew nothing about corruption and was \u201cjust a designer.\u201d I asked him why he thought the hotel had been built in such an inhospitable part of Baku. \u201cEvery project has detractors,\u201d he said. When I asked him if he had seen large payments being made in cash, he hung up. (He did not respond to later calls.) Alan Garten, the Trump Organization lawyer, did not deny that there was corruption involved in the project. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and defend the Mammadovs,\u201d he said. But, from a legal standpoint, he argued, the Trump Organization was blameless. In his opinion, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act doesn\u2019t apply to the Baku deal, even if corruption occurred. \u201cWe didn\u2019t own it,\u201d he said of the hotel. \u201cWe had no equity. We didn\u2019t control the project. The flow of funds is in the wrong direction.\u201d He added, \u201cWe did not pay any money to anyone. Therefore, it could not be a violation of the F.C.P.A.\u201d \u201cNo, that\u2019s just wrong,\u201d Jessica Tillipman, an assistant dean at George Washington University Law School, who specializes in the F.C.P.A., said. \u201cYou can\u2019t go into business deals in Azerbaijan assuming that you are immune from the F.C.P.A.\u201d She added, \u201cNor can you escape liability by looking the other way. The entire Baku deal is a giant red flag\u2014the direct involvement of foreign government officials and their relatives in Azerbaijan with ties to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. Corruption warning signs are rarely more obvious.\u201d Tillipman explained that the F.C.P.A. defines corruption as \u201cthe payment of money or anything of value\u201d to a foreign official. Last year, JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay two hundred and sixty-four million dollars to settle charges that it had violated the F.C.P.A.; the bank had given jobs and internships to relatives and friends of government officials in Asia. Tillipman, along with several other F.C.P.A. experts, told me that the Trump Organization had clearly provided things of value in the Baku deal: its famous brand, its command of the luxury market, its extensive technical advice. In May, 2012, the month the Baku deal was finalized, the F.C.P.A. was evidently on Donald Trump\u2019s mind. In a phone-in appearance on CNBC, he expressed frustration with the law. \u201cEvery other country goes into these places and they do what they have to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible law and it should be changed.\u201d If American companies refused to give bribes, he said, \u201cyou\u2019ll do business nowhere.\u201d He continued, \u201cThere is one answer\u2014go to your room, close the door, go to sleep, and don\u2019t do any deals, because that\u2019s the only way. The only way you\u2019re going to do it is the other way.\u201d It is unclear how the Trump Administration plans to approach F.C.P.A. enforcement. Jay Clayton, Trump\u2019s choice to run the Securities and Exchange Commission, co-authored a paper in 2011 arguing that American companies were at a severe disadvantage because of the U.S. government\u2019s \u201csingular strategy of zealous enforcement.\u201d But Jeff Sessions, the new Attorney General, told the Senate Judiciary Committee during his confirmation hearings that he will continue to uphold the F.C.P.A.\n\nAfter 9/11, prosecuting financial corruption acquired new political importance. The C.I.A. and other intelligence services came to believe that preventing illicit money from flowing through the global financial system was a necessary tactic in preventing future terrorist attacks, and the U.S. led an international effort to enforce financial transparency. Banks and other financial entities were required to vet their clients aggressively and to report any suspicious activity. Prosecutions for money laundering, bribery, and other financial crimes rose significantly. In 2000, the government launched three prosecutions under the F.C.P.A. Last year, it initiated fifty-four. Investigators of financial fraud like to say that government corruption, money laundering, and other illicit behavior often form a \u201cnexus\u201d with even more troubling activity, such as financing terrorism and developing weapons of mass destruction. This appears to be true in the Baku deal. As the Mammadovs were preparing to build the tower, the family patriarch, Ziya, was cementing his financial relationship with the Darvishis, the Iranian family with ties to the country\u2019s Revolutionary Guard. At least three Darvishis\u2014the brothers Habil, Kamal, and Keyumars\u2014appear to be associates of the Guard. In Farsi press accounts, Habil, who runs the Tehran Metro Company, is referred to as a sardar, a term for a senior officer in the Revolutionary Guard. A cable sent on March 6, 2009, from the U.S. Embassy in Baku described Kamal as having formerly run \u201can alleged Revolutionary Guard-controlled business in Iran.\u201d The company, called Nasr, developed and acquired instruments, guidance systems, and specialty metals needed to build ballistic missiles. In 2007, Nasr was sanctioned by the U.S. for its role in Iran\u2019s effort to develop nuclear missiles. The cable said that Kamal and Keyumars were frequent visitors to Azerbaijan; Kamal had recently established \u201ca close business relationship/friendship\u201d with Ziya Mammadov, and, with Mammadov\u2019s assistance, had been awarded \u201cat least eight major road construction and rehabilitation contracts, including contracts for construction of the Baku-Iranian Astara highway.\u201d (Keyumars also seems to have been involved in these deals.) The cable added, \u201cWe assume Mammedov [sic] is a silent partner in these contracts.\u201d \u201cDoes the No. 1 stop here and does that go to Penn Station and can I get a train there to Philadelphia and then how do I get to Walnut Street?\u201d Iran has two militaries. The Iranian Army is a conventional force whose mission is to protect the country. The Revolutionary Guard is an independent force of about a hundred and fifty thousand soldiers, whose duty is to protect the country\u2019s Islamic system and to preserve the power of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The Revolutionary Guard has its own air force and navy, and it has a unit known as the Quds Force, which the United States has identified as a major supporter of Hezbollah and other international terrorist groups. The Guard has developed a shadow economy within Iran to fund its activities and expand its power. It controls all official border crossings and runs several unofficial ports, solely for its own use. The Revolutionary Guard smuggles into the country everything from consumer goods blocked by sanctions to drugs. It also owns seemingly legitimate companies in construction, energy, telecommunications, auto manufacturing, and banking. According to the United States Institute of Peace, the Guard is linked \u201cto dozens, perhaps even hundreds, of companies that appear to be private in nature but are run by [Revolutionary Guard] veterans.\u201d J. Matthew McInnis, an Iran expert at the American Enterprise Institute, who served as a consultant to Michael Flynn when Flynn was the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told me that owners of Revolutionary Guard-related businesses often become rich. But there is a catch: from time to time, they should expect to be asked to serve the needs of the Guard. \u201cWhen the Revolutionary Guard says, \u2018We need to move some illicit stuff,\u2019 or \u2018We need new parts for our missiles,\u2019 they reach out to these guys,\u201d McInnis explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a soft network that can do all sorts of things that are very hard to trace.\u201d Keyumars Darvishi once ran Raman, a construction firm that is owned by the Islamic Revolution Mostazafan Foundation. According to the United Nations, the foundation is a major financial arm of the Revolutionary Guard. Keyumars left Raman to run Azarpassillo, the putatively independent construction company that received multiple road contracts in Azerbaijan. According to Azarpassillo\u2019s Web site, it was incorporated in 2008. In recent years, Keyumars has also served as the acting director of the Tehran Metro Company, filling in for his brother Habil. Mehrzad Boroujerdi, a political scientist at Syracuse University, who studies the political, economic, and military \u00e9lite of Iran, said, \u201cIt looks like Azarpassillo is a front organization for the Revolutionary Guard.\u201d He found it inconceivable that Keyumars Darvishi, after working for years in a company controlled by the Revolutionary Guard, would quit, raise large amounts of capital on his own, and then become the head of a fully independent company that competed against Revolutionary Guard fronts for contracts. Khatam Al-Anbia, an Iranian construction giant that is controlled by the Guard and is under U.S. sanctions, has subcontracted Azarpassillo on at least two major infrastructure projects in Iran. The Tehran Metro Company is also involved in both projects. McInnis told me, \u201cIf you see a connection with Khatam Al-Anbia, you would assume the connections to the Revolutionary Guard are there. The suspicion of Azarpassillo being a front company is certainly worth investigating. It would fit a normal pattern.\u201d Alan Garten told me that the Trump Organization checks to see if potential Trump partners are on \u201cwatch lists and sanctions lists,\u201d and that the company knew nothing of Ziya Mammadov\u2019s relationship to the Darvishis until 2015, when it learned that \u201ccertain principals associated with the developer may have had some association with some problematic entities.\u201d And yet, by that point, the U.S. Embassy cables had been online for four years. Garten insisted that the Trump Organization still has no idea if the association between the Mammadovs and the Darvishis is real, or if it\u2019s simply an allegation \u201cspread by the media.\u201d I recently spoke with Allison Melia, who until 2015 was one of the C.I.A.\u2019s lead analysts of Iran\u2019s economy; she now works for the Crumpton Group, a strategic advisory firm whose services include conducting due diligence for companies. She told me that her team could have compiled a dossier on the Mammadovs and their connection to the Revolutionary Guard in \u201ca couple of days.\u201d She said that any reputable investigative firm conducting a risk assessment would have advised a U.S. company to avoid a deal with a family connected to the Revolutionary Guard. The U.S. has imposed various sanctions on Iran since the Islamic Revolution, in 1979. In recent years, U.S. and international efforts have focussed on isolating Iran from the global financial system, in order to prevent it from funding terrorist groups and contributing to worldwide instability. In 2015, the U.N., spurred by the Obama Administration, reached an agreement with Iran, and lifted some sanctions in return for a slowdown of the country\u2019s nuclear program. However, according to the Congressional Research Service, many sanctions against Iran remain in effect, because of the country\u2019s \u201csupport for terrorism, its human-rights abuses, its interference in specified countries in the region, and its missile and advanced-conventional-weapons programs.\u201d In December, 2015, the U.S. House of Representatives imposed additional sanctions on the Revolutionary Guard and its associated businesses. American companies must insure that they are not receiving funds that originated with any sanctioned entity. Ignorance is not a defense, especially if there is ample warning that a foreign partner could have a link to such an entity. Most firms, upon hearing of even a slight chance of Iranian involvement, conduct due diligence that is much more extensive than what is typical for F.C.P.A. compliance. Erich Ferrari, an attorney who specializes in sanctions-related legal cases, said that before the Trump Organization cashed any checks it should have been certain of \u201cthe source of the funds\u201d\u2014\u201cnot only the bank it was remitted from but how the Mammadovs actually earned the money they paid.\u201d He said of the Baku deal, \u201cIt takes a lot to shock a lawyer, but I\u2019ve had very few clients do so little due diligence.\u201d\n\nThe nexus between the Mammadovs and the Darvishis suggests both opportunism and desperation. Ziya Mammadov is sixty-four, and in recent years the family\u2019s position in Azerbaijan has begun to weaken. President Aliyev has systematically isolated, and then fired, longtime members of the regime in order to make way for his own cronies. From 2008 to 2014, Ziya Mammadov, perhaps fearing his ejection from political office, vastly increased his personal wealth. During the same period, mounting international sanctions made it far more difficult for Iran to sell oil abroad, receive foreign funds, and import products. International banks became increasingly reluctant to accept funds from businesses owned by the Revolutionary Guard, severely limiting its ability to support allies such as Hezbollah and the Syrian government. At a moment when Iran was struggling to find ways to send money outside the country, Keyumars Darvishi joined Azarpassillo and began making one deal after another in Azerbaijan. Ziya Mammadov apparently had complete discretion with regard to Azarpassillo\u2019s projects. On April 6, 2007, Anne Derse, then the U.S. Ambassador to Azerbaijan, wrote in a cable that Charles Redman, at the time a senior vice-president for the American construction firm Bechtel, had recently met with Ziya Mammadov. Redman was looking for business, and knew that Azerbaijan was planning several major new roads. Bechtel could build them, he said, at an average cost of six million dollars per kilometre. Mammadov complained to him that this was too expensive. Bechtel ended up building nothing. Instead, much of the roadwork was done by Azarpassillo\u2014at a much higher cost. According to a 2012 report by Azerbaijan\u2019s Center for Economic and Social Development, an independent think tank, road construction during Mammadov\u2019s tenure was \u201cthe most expensive in the world,\u201d costing an average of eighteen million dollars per kilometre. (Derse declined to comment; Redman did not respond to e-mails.) The available evidence strongly suggests that Ziya Mammadov conspired with an agent of the Revolutionary Guard to make overpriced deals that would enrich them both while allowing them to flout prohibitions against money laundering and to circumvent sanctions against Iran. Based on Ziya Mammadov\u2019s past, it seems reasonable to assume that his main motive was profit. Like most Azerbaijanis, he is a secular Shiite Muslim, and he has no known ties to hard-line factions in Iran. Why did the Darvishis want to work with the Mammadovs? It might have caught their attention that the Mammadovs had their own private bank\u2014one that had unfettered access to the global financial system. While Azarpassillo was making deals with the Transportation Ministry, the Mammadovs were investing heavily in a series of large construction projects. Money launderers love construction projects. They attract legitimate funds from governments and private investors, and they require frequent payouts to legitimate subcontractors: cement factories, lumberyards, glass manufacturers, craftsmen. In the Trump Tower Baku project, money was going in and out of the U.S., the United Kingdom, Turkey, Romania, the United Arab Emirates, and several other countries. With such projects, it can be exceedingly difficult to detect the spread of illicit funds. At the same time, the Mammadovs\u2019 money was flowing through holding companies in offshore banking centers. According to leaked documents in the Panama Papers, companies controlled by the family have opened accounts in such places as the Bahamas, the British Virgin Islands, and Panama. The shell companies that list Mammadovs as beneficiaries or officers have bland names such as Trans-European Leasing Group and 1st Rate Investment, and many of them are owned by other shell companies. In 2009, a year after Baku XXI Century began building the tower, the company opened the Baku International Bus Terminal, an enormous station that includes a shopping mall and a hotel. During this period, the Mammadov family also began building a hotel, a golf course, and a spa in the mountains north of Baku. Meanwhile, the Mammadovs spent lavishly on themselves. Ziya built a mansion in one of the most expensive neighborhoods of Baku, and, on the beach, a villa whose walls are decorated to resemble ancient Egyptian bas-reliefs. Elton\u2019s son, Aynar, became famous for having a collection of expensive cars, including a Ferrari, a Maserati, and a Lamborghini. Anar began using the Gulfstream G450, which typically costs forty-one million dollars, and bought a seven-bedroom home in London. He also spent millions of dollars on an effort to promote Azerbaijan in Washington, D.C., hosting galas for members of Congress and other powerful figures. A former associate of the Trump Organization told me that in 2012, on one of Anar\u2019s trips to America, he visited Trump Tower, in New York, to meet with Donald Trump and company executives. (The Trump Organization would not confirm the visit.) Around this time, the contracts for the Baku project were issued. Between 2004 and 2014, Mammadov family businesses spent more than half a billion dollars on large construction projects. They also poured money into a major construction-materials company, an insurance firm, and a new headquarters. It\u2019s not clear how the Mammadovs funded such enormous investments while spending so much on themselves. They may have received loans, or secretly owned profitable businesses that supported the flurry of spending. Another explanation is that some of the investment money came from the Revolutionary Guard, through Azarpassillo. Calls and e-mails to Azarpassillo, the Iranian Mission to the U.N., and the Azerbaijani government were not returned. Ziya and Anar Mammadov did not respond to requests for comment. Donald Trump has not addressed the Baku deal since becoming President. A Department of Justice spokesperson would not comment on the possibility of its investigating the Trump Tower Baku deal.
