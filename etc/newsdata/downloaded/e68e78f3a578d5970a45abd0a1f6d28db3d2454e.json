I\u2019m personally most excited for the return of Netflix\u2019s \u201cBoJack Horseman\u201d and HBO\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley.\u201d Those are perennial must-watches and both will end with these new seasons.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s not a \u201creturning\u201d show technically, and therefore not on the list below, but the most recent season of \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d (which earned multiple Emmy nominations) will debut on Netflix on Oct. 10. That season already aired on Pop TV, but most people seem to watch the show on Netflix, so in a way it\u2019s \u201creturning.\u201d\n\nYou can read more about all the shows below, as well as watch their trailers.\n\nAnd if you want to stay informed on what\u2019s joining Netflix on a weekly basis, be sure to subscribe to the Streamline newsletter.\n\nJi Sub Jeong/HuffPost\n\n\u201cSorry for Your Loss,\u201d Season 2 (Facebook Watch, Oct. 1)\n\nFacebook Watch Elizabeth Olsen in \"Sorry for Your Loss\"\n\nDetails: A widow reckons with having to move on.

You can watch for free on Facebook here.\n\nRead on: Series creator Kit Steinkellner spoke with Indiewire about the storytelling process. Here\u2019s her explanation of how the writing team approached the two seasons:\n\nThe metaphor I used was this woman has been stranded on a distant planet, and her goal [in Season 1] is to just emerge from the wreckage, make sure her oxygen tank is working, and get to that nearby crater 100 feet away. ... And she did. She survived. ... And so, we wanted to tell the story that comes next, which is once you get your head above water, once you know you can swim, what do you do?\n\nTrailer:\n\n\u201cBig Mouth,\u201d Season 3 (Netflix, Oct. 4)\n\nNetflix \"Big Mouth\"\n\nDetails: Kids going through puberty in a suburb of New York City hang out with anthropomorphized versions of their sexuality. Spending time with literal manifestations of their newfound horniness allows them to explore what sexuality means.\n\nThe main voice cast includes Fred Armisen, Jessi Klein, Nick Kroll, Jason Mantzoukas, John Mulaney, Jordan Peele, Maya Rudolph and Jenny Slate.\n\nSeasons of \u201cBig Mouth\u201d run 10 episodes of roughly 25 minutes each.\n\nRead on: This season has a crossover episode with other Netflix hit \u201cQueer Eye.\u201d The full cast of that show makes an animated appearance. As Entertainment Weekly describes, the \u201cQueer Eye\u201d cast does a makeover for the \u201cBig Mouth\u201d character Coach Steve. Here\u2019s an explanation:\n\nTheir next makeover target? Coach Steve, who\u2019s living on the S.S. Diaper Barge and using one brush for literally all his body parts. Van Ness has the appropriate response: \u201cJesus in my vagina, that poor brush.\u201d\n\nTrailer:\n\n\u201cGoliath,\u201d Season 3 (Amazon Prime, Oct. 4)\n\nGreg Lewis/Amazon Prime Billy Bob Thornton in \"Goliath\"\n\nDetails: A lawyer with a guilty conscience about his money-seeking past tries to win tough cases for the moral good.

Dennis Quaid guest-stars.\n\n\u201cGoliath\u201d seasons run eight episodes of roughly 50 minutes each.\n\nRead on: On the press cycle for \u201cGoliath\u201d over the years, Thornton has repeatedly pointed out that the independent films he used to make are no longer possible and that streaming television has been the better avenue for more niche productions. Here he is talking to Vulture in 2018:\n\nI love independent film so much, and that\u2019s kind of where I made my mark. But independent film is not as big a thing now. The type of independent film I made is out of existence, so doing something like this gives me an opportunity to do an independent film over a long period of time. That\u2019s exactly what it feels like. It doesn\u2019t feel like television in the traditional sense.\n\nTrailer:\n\n\u201cPeaky Blinders,\u201d Season 5 (Netflix, Oct. 4)\n\nRobert Viglasky/Netflix Cillian Murphy in \"Peaky Blinders\"\n\nDetails: Set in post-World War I England, a gang tries to gain power through any means necessary.

This latest season earned its highest viewership yet, with episodes regularly attracting millions of viewers. RadioTimes explained the main reason for the increased popularity:\n\nA huge factor is the show\u2019s move to BBC One, with series one to four of Peaky Blinders airing on BBC Two. On that channel, the highest viewing figure achieved was 2.4 million for the season four finale.\n\nTrailer:\n\n\u201cMr. Robot,\u201d Season 4 (USA, Oct. 6)\n\nUSA Christian Slater and Rami Malek in \"Mr. Robot\"\n\nDetails: A cyber-vigilante living in New York City tries to thwart various villains through hacking, while also trying to get ahold of his mental health.

He contrasted this one to the previous season, saying:\n\nSeason 3\u2019s theme was disintegration, where we\u2019ve seen Elliot and Mr. Robot at odds like we have never seen them before in the series, I would say that the word for season 4 is integration. We saw a little bit of this at the end of season 3, where we\u2019ve seen them go through this reconciliation, and season 4 now begins this new relationship where they\u2019re really on the same team now and working together.\n\nTrailer:\n\n\u201cEl Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie\u201d (Netflix, Oct. 11)\n\nBen Rothstein/Netflix Aaron Paul in \"El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie\"\n\nDetails: Not exactly a returning \u201cshow,\u201d but since this special movie is a continuation of the \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d saga, I\u2019m making an exception here. The exact plot remains mysterious, but this will likely follow the character Jesse as he runs from the law.\n\nAaron Paul stars. Jonathan Banks apparently makes an appearance. Will Bryan Cranston?\n\n\u201cEl Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie\u201d runs 2 hours, 2 minutes.\n\nRead on: Speaking with The Hollywood Reporter, series creator Vince Gilligan spoke about the methods the production crew used to avoid leaks and spoilers. Reporter Rebecca Keegan summed up the process:\n\nThey did use other means to keep the project hush-hush, including waiting until the last possible minute to share the script with crew, obscuring locations with trucks and screens and relying on a private jet to shuttle a key castmember in and out of Albuquerque without notice.\n\nTrailer:\n\n\u201cCastle Rock,\u201d Season 2 (Hulu, Oct. 23)\n\nHulu Lizzy Caplan in \"Castle Rock\"\n\nDetails: This season, a nurse struggling with her mental health tries to protect her daughter from mysterious forces in the town of Castle Rock.

The idea is to use one of the author\u2019s favorite creepy Maine burgs as a hub that connects all of his stories \u2014 the characters, the monsters, the legends \u2014 within a multiverse that serves as a backdrop for new prestige TV tales.\n\nTrailer:\n\n\u201cBoJack Horseman,\u201d Season 6 (Netflix, Oct. 25)\n\nNetflix \"BoJack Horseman\"\n\nDetails: In this final season of the show, the titular character tries to reset his life through rehab. An alcoholic and guilt-ridden past keep the character from happiness, but renewed self-awareness and intimate human connection may finally save him. Note: Netflix has split this final season in two parts, with the second half of the season debuting in early 2020.\n\nThe main voice cast includes Will Arnett, Alison Brie, Aaron Paul, Amy Sedaris and Paul F. Tompkins.\n\nSeasons of \u201cBoJack Horseman\u201d run about 12 episodes of roughly 25 minutes each.\n\nRead on: On Twitter, Paul claimed that Netflix canceled \u201cBoJack.\u201d This news came after the recent surprise cancellation of \u201cBoJack\u201d-adjacent show \u201cTuca & Bertie.\u201d Here\u2019s the text from the Paul tweet:\n\nWe had a wonderful time making Bojack. Couldn\u2019t be more proud. Fell in love with these characters just like everyone else did but sadly Netflix thought it was time to close the curtains and so here we are. They gave us a home for 6 beautiful years. Nothing we could do about it.\n\nTrailer:\n\n\u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d Season 6 (HBO, Oct. 27)\n\nAli Paige Goldstein/HBO Kumail Nanjiani and Thomas Middleditch in \"Silicon Valley\"\n\nDetails: In this final season, the tech company that has grown throughout the series finally becomes an industry titan.

But there are a lot of good, well-intentioned people there. In the world of Wall Street, people are there to make money \u2014 it\u2019s pure unadulterated capitalism. Silicon Valley has people who are actually interested in the technology, so it\u2019s a little different. As much as I make fun of Silicon Valley, I prefer its personalities to pure Wall Street people.", "description": "Here's what to stream this month.", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d94c7cc2100003100518fc9.png?cache=MdiLUBM43e&ops=1778_1000"}
