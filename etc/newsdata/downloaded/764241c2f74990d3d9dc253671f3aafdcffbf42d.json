Again, he spurned the opportunity. A reporter asked him, \u201cWere you joking when you asked China to investigate the Bidens?\u201d \u201cChina has to do whatever they want,\u201d Trump replied without any change of expression. \u201cIf China wants to look into something, I think that\u2019s great. And if they don\u2019t want to, I think that\u2019s great too.\u201d On Friday, Trump again suggested that China should look into the family. \u201cChina can do whatever they want,\u201d the president told reporters, \u201cwith respect to one and a half billion dollars\u201d that was supposedly (but not actually) entrusted to Biden\u2019s son.\n\nTrump sometimes pretends, after the fact, that he was joking. That\u2019s what he did in 2018, when special counsel Robert Mueller asked about the July 2016 press conference in which Trump invited Russia to hack Clinton\u2019s emails. Trump told Mueller that video of the press conference showed his request was \u201cin jest.\u201d But Russian operatives, watching the video, concluded that it wasn\u2019t. \u201cWithin five hours of Trump\u2019s remark,\u201d says Mueller\u2019s report, \u201ca Russian intelligence service began targeting email accounts associated with Hillary Clinton for possible hacks.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that Trump thinks all of this is fun. He loves the idea of foreign countries targeting his opponents. He thinks beating up reporters is hilarious. But that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s joking. It just means he\u2019s twisted. And Republicans like Rubio, who shrug off the president\u2019s outbursts, aren\u2019t more clever or sophisticated than the rest of us. They\u2019re just cowards.", "description": "", "authors": ["William Saletan", "Slate.Com News-And-Politics Trump-Collusion-Jokes.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
