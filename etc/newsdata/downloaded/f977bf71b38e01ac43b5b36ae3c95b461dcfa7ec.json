The EU is expecting a similar ruling over U.S. subsidies for Boeing that would allow it to set tariffs on American goods.\n\n\u201cThe EU must react and probably raise punitive tariffs itself after WTO approval,\u201d Maas wrote on Twitter, in an apparent reference to a similar WTO case involving Boeing.\n\nMaas, however, said that the EU \u201cremains prepared to jointly negotiate rules for subsidies to the aircraft industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can still avert further damage,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe U.S. tariffs do not go into effect before Oct. 18, leaving some space for negotiations.\n\nThe Spanish government echoed that hope.\n\nMinister of Agriculture Luis Planas said, \u201cthere is still a margin for negotiation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government of Spain will bring to bear all the pressure (it can),\u201d he said.\n\nPlanas said Spain was going to push the European Commission to have the agricultural products removed from the American list.\n\nHe said the government would be supporting its producers of olive oil, olives, pork products and cheese, among the businesses most vulnerable to the U.S. tariffs.", "description": "The U.S. imposed tariffs after getting approval from the WTO over European subsidies for plane-maker Airbus.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GE765_Trump__ZG_20180302125155.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
