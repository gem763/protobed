SDF commander Mazloum Abdi said on Wednesday that Trump had promised to maintain long-term support for the Kurdish-led forces.\n\nAbdi also held a phone call with Russia\u2019s Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, Interfax news agency reported, and said he backed the actions of Russian military police and Syrian military.\n\nFRICTION WITHIN NATO\n\nIn a sign of growing ties between Ankara and Moscow, the head of Russia\u2019s defence sales agency was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying Moscow could deliver more S-400 missile defence systems to Turkey.\n\nTurkey, a NATO member, has already been frozen out of a programme to buy and help produce F-35 jets and faces possible U.S. sanctions for buying the S-400 systems, which Washington says are incompatible with NATO\u2019s defences and threaten the F-35 if operated near the stealth fighter.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters, Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said the disagreements over the F-35 could be overcome. Despite criticism from allies over the Syria incursion and its growing ties with Moscow, Turkey remained at the heart of NATO, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are at the centre of NATO, and we remain determined to carry out all of our responsibilities fully. We are going nowhere,\u201d he said.\n\nA senior Trump administration official said the United States still hoped Turkey would not deploy the S-400 system.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump delivers a statement on the conflict in Syria as Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House National Security Advisor Robert O\u2019Brien stand by in the Diplomatic Room of the White House in Washington, U.S., October 23, 2019.
