Biden by paying high fees to his son Hunter.\n\n\u201cIn May of this year, I became concerned that a negative narrative about Ukraine fueled by assertions made by Ukraine\u2019s departing Prosecutor General, was reaching the President of the United States and impeding out ability to support the new Ukrainian government as robustly as I believed we should,\u201d Mr. Volker said.\n\nMr. Volker is a key figure in the impeachment inquiry. He was one of the leading figures in trying to get President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to talk.\n\nMr. Volker reached out to Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, to warn him that Mr. Lutsenko and his allegations were unreliable. Mr. Giuliani was planning to travel to Ukraine at that time, although that trip was ultimately cancelled.\n\nMr. Volker defended Mr. Biden against allegations of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cI have known former Vice President Biden for 24 years. The the suggestions that he would be influenced in his duties as Vice President by money for his son simply had no credibility to me. I know him as a man of integrity and dedication to our country,\u201d he told lawmakers.\n\nWhile Mr. Volker knew that Mr. Giuliani was pressing for the Ukrainian government to make a statement about fighting corruption and mention Burisma or the 2016 election, he said he was unaware that Mr. Biden was a specific subject of discussion until the transcript of Mr. Trump\u2019s phone conversation with the Ukrainian president was made public.\n\nMr. Volker said he was under the impression the meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky would be focused on rooting out corruption in the Ukrainian government.\n\nThat public statement was ultimately scrapped after diplomats grew concerned about Ukraine appearing to interfere in the 2020 elections.\n\nThe former state department official explained that in his efforts to support the new Ukrainian administration, led by Mr. Zelensky, he was asked by the president\u2019s aide Andrey Yermak to connect him to Mr. Giuliani.\n\n\u201cI did so solely because I understood that the new Ukrainian leadership wanted to convince those, like Mayor Giuliani, who believed such a negative narrative about Ukraine, that times have changed and that under President Zelenksy Ukraine is worthy of U.S. support,\u201d Mr. Volker said.\n\nHe notified the Ukrainians that Mr. Giuliani was not an official U.S. representative.\n\nAs Mr. Volker was setting up a meeting between Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Yermak in mid-July, he was notified that there was a delay on aide of Ukraine, but he did not see it as connected to the ongoing efforts to set up a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky.\n\n\u201cI did not perceive these issues to be linked in any way,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything from the force of law to the unanimous position of the House, Senate, Pentagon State Department and NSC staff agued for going forward, and I knew it would just be a matter of time.\u201d\n\nMr. Volker spent more than nine hours being questioned by members and staffers on Capitol Hill Wednesday, as part of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry against the president. It is centered on the allegations that Mr. Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate his political opponent, Mr. Biden.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
