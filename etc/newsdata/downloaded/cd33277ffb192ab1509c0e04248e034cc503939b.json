Manodh Marks pleaded guilty to attempting to take control of the Kuala Lumpur-bound MH128 last May. The 26-year-old had been under the influence of ice when he claimed to also be in possession of a bomb.\n\nSri Lankan man to spend at least nine years behind bars over plane terror threat\n\nFor nearly two hours passengers on a Malaysian Airlines flight from Melbourne to Sri Lanka thought they were going to die because Manodh Marks was threatening to destroy the plane.\n\nHe had devices with flashing blue lights in each hand as he stood outside the cockpit of the Airbus with 222 people on board and threatened to \u201cblow the f***ing plane up\u201d.\n\nThe then 25-year-old was jailed last year for up to 12 years and will have to serve at least nine before he\u2019s deported back to his home city of Colombo after pleading guilty to attempting to take or exercise control over a plane. But he\u2019s now hoping to have that sentence overturned so he can return immediately.\n\nHis lawyer Paul Smallwood claims it\u2019s not out of the question Marks be handed a fresh sentence involving no jail time.\n\nMarks had only just been released from a psychiatric unit before he boarded the flight and made the ill-advised decision to use ice.\n\n\u201cThis is a man who was very, very psychiatrically unwell,\u201d Mr Smallwood told the Court of Appeal on Friday.\n\nMarks was in a different position to someone who had been \u201cboozing on\u201d in the lounge before takeoff, he said.\n\nMarks had used drugs before boarding the plane but he was already experiencing residual psychiatric symptoms.\n\nA sentence without jail time was not entirely out of the sentencing range that had been available to County Court Judge Michael McInerney, Mr Smallwood said. Commonwealth prosecutor Krista Breckweg\u2019s said the fact Marks did not have a real bomb did not obliterate his moral culpability, but it was lower than if the bomb had been real.\n\nThe device turned out to be a bluetooth speaker, but his claims had still deliberately terrified passengers who didn\u2019t know that at the time. Three judges are hearing the appeal and agreed with the prosecutors position. The consequences of it being a real bomb would have been \u201ccertain death for everyone on that plane\u201d and that would have been terrifying to anyone, Justice Simon Whelan said.\n\n\u201cThey are terrorised exactly as if it was a real bomb,\u201d he said. Ms Breckweg added that a report found the primary cause of the incident was Marks\u2019 meth-induced psychosis.\n\nPassengers and crew restrained Marks on board the plane during the incident, which occurred shortly after takeoff.\n\nThe plane landed within 15 minutes, but it took 40 minutes for security to arrive and passengers had to remain on board for nearly 90 minutes after. Marks was in court for the hearing. The judges will hand down their decision at a later date.", "description": "For nearly two hours passengers on a Malaysian Airlines flight from Melbourne to Sri Lanka thought they were going to die because Manodh Marks was threatening to destroy the plane.", "authors": ["Karen Sweeney"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ce8cef30082c52b02a501cf8fe4ca2ee?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
