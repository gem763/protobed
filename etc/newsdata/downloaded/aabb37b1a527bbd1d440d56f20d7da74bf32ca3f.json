He asked his fellow workers to help rescue it before the snake slithered up his body and coiled around his neck (pictured)\n\nBut when he tried to force the python into a sack, it quickly reared up and slithered on to Bhuvanachandran\u2019s body instead- before tightly coiling itself around his neck.\n\nIn the nerve-wracking clip, he can be seen trying to balance himself while two locals try to grab the opposite end of the snake and unwrap it from Bhuvanachandran\u2019s neck.\n\nThe men hastily try to untie the snake with a piece of cloth to get a better grip on the reptile, just as the builder is choking for breath.\n\nOne of the fellow workers, who is from the Kerala Institute of Management, was determined to free his friend, on Tuesday\n\nThe builder waits patiently and does not speak a word during the tense clip where men force him to follow their lead so they can get rid of the snake\n\nA joint effort: Two of the men work together to life the snake while others watch on baffled and shocked\n\nThey hold both end's of the python and lift it over the man's head and then pull the snake away and lower it to the ground.\n\nOthers stand back and spectate the incident, showing a mixture of shock and bafflement.\n\nMoments later, three men steady their grip on the mottled snake and another runs over with a sack and lower the python inside.\n\nTwo men lowered the snake to the ground before a third member grabbed a sack to shove the reptile in. It was later released back into the wild by officials\n\nOnlookers are mesmerised by the moment which saw Bhuvanachandran taken to hospital and treated for neck pain\n\nThe beastly animal was then handed to officials who released it back into the wild.\n\nBhuvanachandran was taken to hospital and treated for pain in neck and then later discharged.\n\nThe worker had been hired by the Kerala Institute of Management in the village of Neyyar near Kerala's capital, Thiruvananthapuram.", "description": "Bhuvachandran Nair was treated for neck pain at hospital after a python jumped up his body and coiled around his neck in village in Kerala, southern India, on October 15.
