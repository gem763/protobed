People inherently don\u2019t like to be told what to buy.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t give up\n\nPersistence has been a big factor in Jordan getting enough work, he explains.\n\nHe\u2019s also a keen advocate of taking time away from the business so that you can ensure that when you are working, you\u2019re at your best.\n\n\u201cSeven business hours working at 80% productivity is far better than 15 hour days at 30% efficiency and not feeling rested in the slightest. It\u2019s not the greatest schedule in terms of longevity.\u201d\n\nExpanding the business\n\nJordan\u2019s voiceover business has taken off to the point that he can now devote all of his efforts towards it.\n\n\u201cGoing full-time was a big step, being able to support myself. I can\u2019t describe how brilliant it was.\u201d\n\nKeen to avoid standing still, he now wants to look at how to move into other areas of voiceover work, from bigger clients to diversifying into documentary voiceovers and animation.\n\n\u201cMainly I want to try to maintain and keep doing what I love for a living.\"\n\nAnd that means the chances of voicing The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe from his home-made studio are increasing by the day.", "description": "When we dream of making it big, coat hangers don't often feature - but for Jordan Reader, they did make an appearance in the reality of his career switch", "authors": ["John Fitzsimons"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20380473.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JordanReader5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
