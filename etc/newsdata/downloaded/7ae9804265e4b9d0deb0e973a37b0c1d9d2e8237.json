The debut of the single, titled \u201cTransform,\u201d was accompanied by a dance performance from season 14 finalist V. Unbeatable.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine a better stage,\u201d Hough, 31, told reporters ahead of the finale. \u201cThis is where people\u2019s lives begin, and I feel like I\u2019m just getting started with my music again.\u201d\n\nBefore Wednesday, Hough hadn\u2019t released a new single since 2010, when she came out with her track, \u201cIs That So Wrong.\u201d Two years prior, in 2008, Hough released her self-titled debut album.\n\n\u201cWhen Mandy [Moore] said she was releasing new music after 10 years I literally DM\u2019d her and said \u2018Wait, what?! I am too! This is so cool!\u2019 \u201d Hough said of Moore, who released her new single, \u201cWhen I Wasn\u2019t Watching,\u201d on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cTo be able to release new music after 10 years of feeling like I suppressed it and pushed it away [and] to find it again in my most creative and authentic voice is super empowering,\u201d Hough shared. \u201cAs much as I want people to hear it and I want to share it, it really was a love note to myself. Being connected back to the artist rather the performer of who I am. I\u2019m really excited.\u201d\n\nAhead of debuting her new song on AGT, Hough teased her performance on Instagram, writing alongside a photo of herself laying on the ground and decked out in gold, \u201cGetting grounded, literally. Can\u2019t wait to perform tonight on the #AGTFinale! @agt.\u201d\n\nThose looking for more music from Hough will soon get to hear her sing with Dolly Parton on Netflix\u2019s new scripted anthology series, Dolly Parton\u2019s Heartstrings, which is based on the stories told through Parton\u2019s songs. Hough will appear on the episode centered on Parton\u2019s 1973 classic \u201cJolene\u201d to play the song\u2019s man-stealing title character.\n\n\u201cI get to be Jolene, one of the most iconic characters she\u2019s written about,\u201d Hough said of Parton. \u201cI\u2019m extremely pumped and honored to be doing music with Dolly. I sing in it, and I sing with her.\u201d\n\nRELATED: America\u2019s Got Talent Standout Kodi Lee Leaves Judges in Tears with Latest Moving Performance\n\nJulianne Hough | Frazer Harrison/Getty More\n\nCompeting in the AGT finals are dance troupe V.
