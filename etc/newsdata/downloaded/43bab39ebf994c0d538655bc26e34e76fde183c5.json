Sharing a studio in an East Village basement, the former classmates started out using the space to work independently on their own projects.\n\nThat didn\u2019t last long. Working together so closely, their ideas just naturally began to meld together, forming what would eventually become Rich Brilliant Willing (RBW), their innovative design firm that focuses on LED-centric lighting fixtures for residential, workplace, and hospitality spaces.\n\nThe name is a playful twist one each of the founder\u2019s last names, something Brill, the firm\u2019s managing partner, says \u201cfittingly spoke to our shared aspirations.\u201d\n\nIncorporated in 2009, RBW has taken the playful philosophy behind its name to its striking minimalist designs. The company doesn\u2019t outsource its production. Instead, it\u2019s in control of all parts of its manufacturing, with a design studio and factory that makes products by hand in Industry City, Brooklyn, and a separate showroom for its work located in Soho.\n\nIn a decade, RBW went from an idea bounced around between college friends to a firm that has provided lighting to headquarters for Silicon Valley giants like Uber and Yelp.\n\nTHE ITEM\n\nJust take a look through RBW\u2019s list of lighting options on its website and you\u2019ll find an extensive, diverse collection that could illuminate a host of spaces. It offers smaller fixtures for sconces to outdoor lighting installations to futuristic chandeliers that vary in size and shape.\n\nFor instance, the brand has various \u201cPalindrome\u201d chandeliers that curve and loop onto themselves like cursive signatures written out in the air. Not every design is so bold. The \u201cCentro\u201d designs offer subtler, smaller circular fixtures that could be well-suited for bathrooms or lighting up corridors.\n\nUnder their workplace banner is everything from small sconce lights that could fit in hallways to large installations that could hover over boardroom tables.\n\nMike Garten\n\nPRICE\n\nAs with the wide range of designs, prices vary. There are the smaller \u201cBrim\u201d lights, smaller customizable sconce displays that price from around $260 to $390. Outdoor options like the small \u201cLedge Round\u201d sconce sells for $220. On the other end of the spectrum, look to the larger chandeliers that could be priced at $9,580, such as the \u201cPilot 16,\u201d or much higher, such as the \u201cCinema 864 121212 Plated,\u201d for $49,740.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nRBW has seen a lot of success in a relatively short amount of time. When it comes to understanding what niche of the lighting world their company fits into, the founders emphasize their versatility.\n\n\u201cOur fixtures are designed to enable a wide set of configurations of sizes and finishes,\u201d says Richardson, the company\u2019s director of development. \u201cOur highly flexible lean manufacturing process also allows us to offer such a quick lead time.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S THE GOOD?\n\nThe firm made a commitment to switch over entirely to LED (light-emitting diode) lighting in 2011. Brill says the company saw \u201crapid changes in LED technologies and the creative possibilities it can offer industrial designers like us to explore unique forms while delivering the quality of light and saving energy consumption.\u201d\n\nHighly energy efficient, LEDs also last a lot longer. Richardson says RBW\u2019s commitment to energy efficiency and sustainability efforts squares with the company\u2019s ambition to \u201cbecome pioneers in decorative lighting by adopting all of our fixtures to LED.\u201d\n\nThey recently achieved B Corporation certification, granted to businesses that hit a high standard for social and environmental impact, public transparency, and legal accountability.\n\n\u201cIt shows our continued commitment contributes to crafting energy-efficient collections and allowing designers and consumers to have the choice to do so without sacrificing beautiful designs,\u201d Richardson says.\n\nMike Garten\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT\n\nLast year, RBW gave its customers something of a glimpse into the future when it presented a conceptual design for thin, flexible lighting panels that used OLEDs (organic light-emitting diodes)\u2014think of them as the next generation LED. They presented the installation that they made with OLED manufacturer OLEDWorks at their Soho showroom during NYCxDesign.\n\n\u201cOLEDs are an emerging source of illumination that resembles thins hefts of light. On the forefront of LED technology, they have, until now, gone largely unexplored in the world of lighting design,\u201d Richardson says. \u201cAs manufacturing volumes increase, lighting with OLEDs is expected to become more commonplace, beginning with niche applications in automotive, aerospace and industrial applications.\u201d\n\nFor the immediate future, Brill says RBW is always looking to push itself and \u201cfind problems to solve.\u201d\n\nHe adds that the company is looking to see what new results they could have by further combining design with technology. Brill says look for things like WiFi-dimming controls and color-tunable LED collections in RBW\u2019s future.", "description": "The Brooklyn-based brand illuminates hip Silicon Valley office spaces and private homes alike", "authors": ["Brian Mastroianni"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-115771/social", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
