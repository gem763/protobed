She could be eligible for parole in five years.\n\nPHOTO: This Oct. 1, 2019, booking photo provided by the Dallas County Sheriff's Department shows former Dallas Police Officer Amber Guyger.

Several members of the family broke down in tears, shaking their heads as if in disbelief of the jury's decision.\n\nBut Jean's 18-year-old brother, Brandt Jean, took the witness stand and spoke to Guyger, saying, \"I know if you go to God and ask him, he will forgive you.\"\n\n\"I love you just like anyone else and I'm not going to hope you rot and die,\" Brandt Jean told Guyger. \"I personally want the best for you. I wasn't going to say this in front of my family, I don't even want you to go to jail. I want the best for you because I know that's exactly what Botham would want for you. Give your life to Christ. I think giving your life to Christ is the best thing Botham would want for you.\"\n\nBrandt Jean then asked Kemp if he could give Guyger a hug, a request the judge granted.\n\nHe stepped off the witness stand and met Guyger in front of the judge's bench and embraced as Guyger broke into tears.\n\nPHOTO: Botham Jean's brother Brandt hugs Amber Guyger after her sentencing, Oct 2, 2019. (ABC News) More\n\nMoments later, Kemp spoke to Guyger privately and also hugged her and appeared to give her words of hope. She also handed her a Bible.\n\nJean's mother, Allison, said at a post-sentencing news conference that while the death of her son \"changed my life, changed my family's life,\" she will accept the jury's decision and try to move on.\n\n\"That 10 years in prison is for her (Guyger) to reflect and to change her life,\" Allison Jean said. \"But there is much more to be done by the city of Dallas. The corruption we saw during this trial must stop. The city of Dallas needs to clean up inside. The Dallas Police Department has a lot of laundry to do. The Texas Rangers need to get on board.\"\n\nShe noted the contamination of the crime scene after her son was killed and said the poor use of the training Guyger received as a police officer \"should never happen again.\"\n\n\"His (Botham's) privacy was violated. She intruded on him and that was not enough. She killed him,\" Allison Jean said. \"If Amber Guyger was trained not to shoot in the heart, my son would be standing here today.\"\n\nMany supporters of the Jean family standing outside the courtroom said the sentence was like a \"slap in the face\" to the family and began chanting, \"No justice, no peace!\"\n\nDallas County District Attorney John Creuzot said he accepted the sentence of the jury, which was sequestered for the entire trial.\n\n\"I expected perhaps longer, but I respect what they did,\" Creuzot said outside the courtroom.\n\nCreuzot described the compassion Brandt Jean showed to Guyger as \"an extraordinary act of healing and forgiveness.\"\n\nStory continues", "description": "Former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger was sentenced on Wednesday to serve 10 years in prison for the fatal 2018 killing of an innocent man she shot when she mistakenly entered his apartment believing it was her own.
