This was really difficult but we still won it,\u201d said Wijnaldum, whose 70th-minute volley slipped through the grasp and legs of on-loan Manchester United goalkeeper Dean Henderson.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Back in previous years we had to play good to win the games. Now we play bad and still win games.\n\n\u201cWhen you comes to teams like this it is always going to be hard. We went to Burnley back in the day and it was really difficult.\n\n\u201cThis season we won there but that was also because we put a lot of effort in. On the other side we also know we have the quality to play.\n\n\u201cI think progress we have made is that we win the games we haven\u2019t played well in.\n\n\u201cEven last season, towards the end, we didn\u2019t play really good but we were just trying to collect as many points as possible. Hopefully when we don\u2019t play well we can still win games.\n\n\u201cUp to now it has been good but we have to make sure it stays like that. We still have to have the progression and do even better.\u201d\n\nMuch of Liverpool\u2019s labouring was down to the hard work and organisation United have developed under Chris Wilder.\n\nIt succeeded in stifling the Reds\u2019 famed front three and this was the first league match since the 2-0 victory over Cardiff on April 21 in which Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino or Sadio Mane did not score.\n\nWijnaldum was on target on that occasion too but he does not feel there is any added responsibility on the midfielders to chip in with goals.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t really think about that. Everyone is responsible,\u201d added the Holland international.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to put everyone in position but it\u2019s not always easy to come into the box and sometimes there are enough people in the box so you can\u2019t go in. We try to mix up everything.\n\n\u201cI love them (scoring a rare away goal \u2013 only his third out of 22 league goals) because we were under pressure and to score a goal it is good.\u201d\n\nDespite the platitudes his side received for the way they stymied Liverpool Wilder was unhappy they could not take advantage.\n\n\u201cI am not bothered about pride, I am bothered about the result. Liverpool had an off day and I think we missed an opportunity,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have had big moments in the game but we did not take them. We had to jump all over it and we didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cPoints are the most important thing and we did not get the points we deserved.\n\nPA", "description": "Georginio Wijnaldum believes Liverpool FC\u2019s scratchy win at Sheffield United is an example of the progress being made under Jurgen Klopp. While winning the Champions League in June was hugely significant in terms of Klopp securing his first trophy, there are other factors by which the development of his squad can be measured.
