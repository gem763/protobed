The performance seemed to signal the realization of the promise Harris displayed during her campaign launch before 22,000 spectators in Oakland. Yet it\u2019s been downhill since the summer spike.\n\nHarris is hoping to duplicate the successes of past campaigns that shed staff and came back to win primaries after near collapses the year before \u2014 and to avoid the fate of countless other hopefuls who spent too big early and faded late. In the memo, Rodriguez, who oversees the campaign\u2019s budgeting, describes an \u201cincredibly competitive resource environment\u201d \u2014 in other words, a keen competition for campaign dollars from larger donors. South Carolina, the other early state besides Iowa that would be key to a Harris turnaround, will be spared any cutbacks.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning of this campaign, Kamala Harris and this team set out with one goal \u2014 to win the nomination and defeat Donald Trump in 2020. This requires us to make difficult strategic decisions and make clear priorities, not threaten to drop out or deploy gimmicks,\u201d Rodriguez wrote, a reference to rival Democrats like Cory Booker, Juli\u00e1n Castro and Andrew Yang, who used attention-seeking deadlines and devices to raise money. \u201cPlenty of winning primary campaigns, like John Kerry\u2019s in 2004 and John McCain\u2019s in 2008, have had to make tough choices on their way to the nomination, and this is no different.\u201d\n\nHarris faced a wave of skepticism over the summer as she flat-lined in polls and spent much of her time at big-dollar fundraisers and away from the campaign trail and news media. As she\u2019s pivoted to Iowa \u2014 Harris plans to spend Thanksgiving there \u2014 her campaign appears to be headed in the opposite direction: She\u2019s held fewer than 10 fundraisers over the month of October, a person familiar with her schedule told POLITICO.\n\nThat's deepened concerns among Democratic officials and some campaign aides in recent days about whether she\u2019ll have the money to compete in early states where she\u2019s being swamped by competitors with higher polling figures.\n\nFurther fanning these fears is what some aides described as a feeble digital fundraising effort to open the latest quarter. Rivals Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg raised more than $1 million each within 24 hours of the October debate, with Klobuchar putting the number at $2 million in the days after their effective confrontations of Elizabeth Warren.\n\nUndergirding Harris' weak fundraising performance and overspending is her increasingly fragile standing in Iowa polls and lack of a standout moment the past four months. In the third quarter, which ended Sept. 30, Harris\u2019 fundraising was flat at $11.8 million. She spent $14.6 million \u2014 $2.8 million more than she raised and nearly double what she spent in the prior quarter as she built out her operation. Staffing and payroll taxes, at $3.8 million, accounted for Harris' largest line item. Her campaign also deferred more than $900,000 in debts, an accounting move that inflated her cash-on-hand figure, which stood at $10.5 million.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unsustainable path,\u201d said Ami Copeland, former deputy national finance director for Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign. Assessing Harris\u2019 third-quarter fundraising blitz, Copeland added, \u201cIf that\u2019s the best you\u2019ll squeeze out bringing all of the assets to bear, it\u2019s looking very dire.\u201d\n\nBiden had nearly $9 million on hand, without carrying debts, and his campaign has since all but embraced a super PAC to help stabilize his standing. He\u2019s endured weeks of questions about his viability while raising $4 million more than Harris and holding virtually the same amount of cash.\n\nBefore the staff moves came to light, a number of Harris aides said they were growing frustrated by what they viewed as repeated, crisis-driven strategy shifts. Since settling on her Iowa-focused strategy, Harris is making her fifth trip there this month with stops in Council Bluffs, Newton and the state Democratic Party\u2019s big Liberty and Justice Celebration Friday night in Des Moines. She also traveled three times to South Carolina.\n\nThe question surrounding the Harris campaign is how to turn it around. Low-polling candidates \u2014 even those with a conceivable shot at placing in Iowa \u2014 seldom raise large sums online, particularly without viral moments. Even those can be fleeting. Harris\u2019 persistent problems come as she\u2019s sought to raise her profile in recent weeks with a steady diet of TV appearances around Democrats\u2019 impeachment efforts of Donald Trump.\n\nOver the weekend, she drew attention by boycotting a criminal justice event at a historically black college in Columbia, S.C., after Trump was given an award and most students weren\u2019t allowed to participate. Harris returned to speak after the awarding sponsor was removed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a viral moment is enough to do it,\u201d said Connor Farrell, a Democrat fundraising consultant who works with progressives. \u201cIt might give you a sugar high, but when you are trailing by $10 million or $20 million in the bank, you need a boost that\u2019s more fundamental.\u201d To turn it around, he added, \u201cShe needs some really good polling in the early states.\u201d\n\nRodriguez wrote in the memo that Harris has raised more than $35 million from over 350,000 donors, with an average contribution of $34. Harris\u2019 competitors outside of Biden, however, all improved over time. Bernie Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg have all steadily amassed tens of millions of dollars during their campaign fundraising efforts.\n\nHarris\u2019 biggest financial hauls have come on the back of huge moments for her campaign: Her January launch and the June debate confrontation with Biden. Harris raised over $4.1 million from June 27 to June 30, according to campaign finance filings \u2014 more than $1 out of every $9 she raised over the entire campaign through Sept. 30.\n\nThat burst of momentum carried into early July. Though filings showing Harris\u2019 online fundraising from July 1 onward will not be available until early next year, the credit card processing fees Harris\u2019 campaign paid in July to ActBlue, the Democratic online fundraising platform, show that she raised close to $3 million online that month.\n\nBut rather than set a new pace for the campaign, Harris\u2019 debate bump faded over the rest of the third quarter \u2014 and with it her fundraising momentum, according to sources and her campaign finance filings. Harris brought in little more via ActBlue in August and September combined than she did in July, finishing the quarter with $6.4 million raised online, including relatively quiet days around other Democratic debates.\n\nThe same thing happened at the beginning of Harris\u2019 campaign: an early burst of unsustainable momentum followed by a slide into the fundraising doldrums. An earlier filing from ActBlue showed that Harris raised over $100,000 online in a day 24 times in February and March amid excitement for her new campaign. But she hit that mark just four times in all of April, May and the first 26 days of June, according to the filings.\n\nLeading up to the first debate, Harris\u2019 online take even dipped below $10,000 on two days, and she went a full four weeks without a $100,000 day on ActBlue.\n\nShe raised $938,000 online in those four pre-debate weeks, compared with $1.7 million for Biden, $5 million for Sanders and $5.7 million for Warren.\n\nHarris filled the gaps of her uneven online fundraising efforts with lucrative in-person events. She held 70 fundraisers over the spring and summer, and a dozen alone over the last week of the third quarter. This month, things have been decidedly slower, with the most high-profile event coming last Thursday, when California Gov. Gavin Newsom chaired a fundraiser in Brentwood, Calif.\n\nDonors contacted by POLITICO said Harris\u2019 failure to take off is months in the making but has coincided with her crash in polls \u2014 and it\u2019s been exacerbated by her recent spirals. That she was lapped by Buttigieg, a small-city mayor from Indiana, and nearly overcome in the third quarter by entrepreneur Andrew Yang, only makes it worse.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s from f---ing California. The idea that you don\u2019t have support of high-dollar donors doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d said a Democratic donor who maxed out to Harris\u2019 campaign but is disappointed by her inability to build a large-scale fundraising operation. \u201cI blame her.\u201d\n\nMaggie Severns contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": ["Christopher Cadelago"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/90/d4/14ad8031401da4fda3401a8d17f8/191030-kamala-harris-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
