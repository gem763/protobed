REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU negotiator Michel Barnier on Thursday expressed pessimism on the prospects of clinching a divorce deal with Britain ahead of its withdrawal from the bloc on Oct. 31.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to revise the terms that his predecessor Theresa May agreed with the EU but failed to pass at home. The European Union, however, said he has not made any meaningful proposals to win them over.\n\n\u201cI cannot objectively tell you whether the contacts we have with Mr Johnson\u2019s government will lead to an agreement by mid-October,\u201d Barnier told European Parliament leaders.\n\nHe said he had no reason to be optimistic and reiterated the bloc\u2019s willingness to work constructively with London and to consider concrete and legally operational proposals that are compatible with the withdrawal agreement.\n\nHe said the EU was ready to work with the British government towards a free trade agreement but warned against any attempt to row back on future competition rules agreed by Theresa May.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the level of ambition of a future free trade agreement will be defined by United Kingdom guarantees related to state aid, taxation or social and environmental standards given its economic size and proximity,\u201d Barnier said.\n\nBefore the British parliament was suspended, opposition lawmakers and rebels from Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party passed legislation that would make Johnson ask for a three-month extension to Britain\u2019s EU membership if parliament has not either approved a deal by Oct. 19 or consented to leaving without one by then.\n\nBarnier said the risk of a no deal Brexit would still remain even with an extension.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, you will have understood, despite the vote of the law of extension, the risk of no deal has not been ruled out. A no deal will never be the choice of the Union. But we do not have the ability to avoid only this scenario,\u201d he said.", "description": "EU negotiator Michel Barnier on Thursday expressed pessimism on the prospects of clinching a divorce deal with Britain ahead of its withdrawal from the bloc on Oct. 31.", "authors": ["Foo Yun Chee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429213999&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B223", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
