I think now 10million people have watched the press conference.\n\n\"So what\u2019s the global audience for this fight going to be? I don\u2019t know, in excess of 50 million?\n\n(Image: Alex Burstow/Getty Images)\n\n\"If we can retain one per cent to the sport, then that\u2019s massive for the sport, but we\u2019ve got to work hard to do that. It\u2019s not going to be easy, I\u2019d like to retain 10 per cent.\n\n\"If we can showcase why we love the sport, Devin Haney, Billy Joe Saunders and show this new audience how great the sport is, then we\u2019ve got a chance.\n\n\"We can\u2019t ignore this new world that we live in. Olympic athletes are no longer role models for the younger generation, Youtube stars are. As sad as it may seem, that\u2019s the truth, that\u2019s the world we live in.\n\n\"We just need to face reality, embrace it and try and use that to keep growing boxing.\"", "description": "The YouTube stars will face the media and fans in London on October 7 ahead of their rematch next month", "authors": ["Hassan Rashed", "Image", "Getty Images", "Alex Burstow Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20078670.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_KSI-VS-Logan-Paul-2-Launch-Press-Conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
