Another of Yalom\u2019s signature ideas, expressed in books such as Staring at the Sun and Creatures of a Day, is that we can lessen our fear of dying by living a regret-free life, meditating on our effect on subsequent generations, and confiding in loved ones about our death anxiety. When I asked whether his lifelong preoccupation with death eases the prospect that he might pass away soon, he replied, \u201cI think it probably makes things easier.\u201d\n\nThe hope that our existential fears can be diminished inspires people around the world to email Yalom daily. In a Gmail folder labeled \u201cFans,\u201d he had saved 4,197 messages from admirers in places ranging from Iran to Croatia to South Korea, which he invited me to look at. Some were simply thank-you notes, expressions of gratitude for the insights delivered by his books. In addition to textbooks and other works of nonfiction, he has written several novels and story collections. Some, such as Love\u2019s Executioner & Other Tales of Psychotherapy and When Nietzsche Wept, have been best sellers.\n\nAs I scrolled through the emails, Yalom used his cane to tap a button that alerted the nurses\u2019 station. A voice came through the intercom, and he explained that he needed some ice for his knee. It was the third time he\u2019d called; he told me his pain was making it difficult to concentrate on anything else, though he was trying. Throughout his stay, his wife of more than 60 years, Marilyn, had been stopping by regularly to refresh his reading material. The day before, he\u2019d had a visit from Georgia May, the widow of the existential psychotherapist Rollo May, who was a colleague and friend of Yalom\u2019s. When he runs out of other things to do, he plays on his iPad or his computer, using them with the dexterity of someone half his age.\n\nMany of Yalom\u2019s fan letters are searing meditations on death. Some correspondents hope he will offer relief from deep-seated problems. Most of the time he suggests that they find a local therapist, but if one isn\u2019t available and the issue seems solvable in a swift period\u2014at this point in his career, he won\u2019t work with patients for longer than a year\u2014he may take someone on remotely. He is currently working with people in Turkey, South Africa, and Australia via the internet. Obvious cultural distinctions aside, he says his foreign patients are not that different from the patients he treats in person. \u201cIf we live a life full of regret, full of things we haven\u2019t done, if we\u2019ve lived an unfulfilled life,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen death comes along, it\u2019s a lot worse. I think it\u2019s true for all of us.\u201d\n\nBecoming Myself is clearly the memoir of a psychiatrist. \u201cI awake from my dream at 3 a.m., weeping into my pillow,\u201d reads the opening line. Yalom\u2019s nightmare involves a childhood incident in which he insulted a girl. Much of the book is about the influence that his youth\u2014particularly his relationship with his mother\u2014has had on his life. He writes, quoting Charles Dickens, \u201cFor, as I draw closer and closer to the end, I travel in the circle, nearer and nearer to the beginning.\u201d", "description": "As a psychotherapist, Irvin Yalom has helped others grapple with their mortality.
