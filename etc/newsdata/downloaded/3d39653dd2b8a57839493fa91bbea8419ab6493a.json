(Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP)\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 At the first moment of true pressure, with the bases loaded around him, Walker Buehler calmly located the release valve.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher entered Game 1 of the National League Division Series against the Washington Nationals on Thursday with just four postseason starts to his name. Yet he was fully prepared for his showdown with Patrick Corbin, encountering little resistance through three innings as he opened with a thumping strikeout of Trea Turner and regularly hit the high-90s with his fastball.\n\nBut Buehler boxed himself in during the top of the fourth, walking Adam Eaton, Anthony Rendon and Howie Kendrick in quick succession to bring Asdrubal Cabrera to the plate. With his wavering fastball control prompting a visit from pitching coach Rick Honeycutt, Buehler went to his curveball twice. Cabrera came up empty on the first and then chased again, sending a meek comeback to the mound.\n\nCabrera\u2019s whimpering dribbler was the biggest threat Buehler faced all night, as the all-star gave up just one hit and struck out eight in six innings to lead the Dodgers to a 6-0 win at Dodger Stadium.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of trust in Honey,\u201d Buehler said, blank-faced, after his first career postseason win. \u201cWe felt good about where that pitch was for me to him. I made a pitch and got out of it.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals, so exuberant as they celebrated their wild-card win two days earlier, were doomed by quiet bats early and overwhelmed by the Dodgers\u2019 offense late. Los Angeles, in search of its third straight World Series trip, looked every bit of the record-setting, 106-win favorite, steadily controlling a pitcher\u2019s duel through six innings before breaking open the game with late fireworks.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re good, they\u2019re really good,\u201d Nationals Manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cThat\u2019s why they have been in the postseason so many years in a row. We didn\u2019t play very well today. \u2026 Honestly, we\u2019re facing some really good pitchers.\u201d\n\nBuehler, who went 14-4 with a 3.26 era this season, needed scant help and the Dodgers offense was more than up to the task. Los Angeles manufactured a first-inning run thanks to three walks by Corbin, scored again in the fifth thanks to a Howie Kendrick error at first and then padded the final tally with eighth-inning homers by Gavin Lux and Joc Pederson. As Washington struggled with self-inflicted pain, Buehler impressed Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts with his steady demeanor.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s guys who want those opportunities and like those big moments and want to be the guy,\u201d said Roberts, who predicted this series would be an \u201code to the old school\u201d because it would be settled by which team received superior starting pitching. \u201c[Buehler] knows how to temper and control his emotions and transfer that into his delivery. From that first throw, he was on point tonight. That\u2019s a really good [Nationals] lineup over there. We needed that one.\u201d\n\nWhile the 25-year-old Buehler, who got the Game 1 start over Clayton Kershaw and Hyun-jin Ryu, entered these playoffs with just 23.2 innings pitched in the playoffs, he has already made history. According to Stats Inc., he is the first National League pitcher to have back-to-back playoff starts of six or more innings while allowing two or fewer hits. Buehler went seven innings in Game 3 of the 2018 World Series against the Boston Red Sox.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t pitch in any big games in high school, just some rivalry games in Lexington, Kentucky,\u201d Buehler said. \u201cYou get to college and throw in some big games. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a singular moment. I think there\u2019s a compounding effect of playing games. There\u2019s certain feelings \u2014 nerves and adrenaline \u2014 you did it enough times and they become normal, they don\u2019t overwhelm you.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nNationals drop Game 1 of NLDS on the road, falling to Dodgers, 6-0\n\nNationals will start Stephen Strasburg in Game 2 of NLDS against Dodgers\n\nNationals\u2019 NLDS roster analysis: A seven-man bullpen and a six-man bench\n\nAnthony Rendon is relaxed and candid ahead of potentially his final run with the Nats\n\nStephen Strasburg is the best pitcher in the Nationals-Dodgers series.
