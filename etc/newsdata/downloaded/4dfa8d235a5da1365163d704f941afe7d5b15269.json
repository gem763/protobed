The findings could explain the higher prevalence of asthma, allergies and other immune conditions in babies born by caesarean.\n\n\u201cHow your immune system functions through your life might be influenced by its first interactions with bacteria,\u201d said Nigel Field, a senior author on the paper from University College London. \u201cIf there are differences in longer-term health outcomes by different patterns of [bacteria], that tells us something quite important about health.\u201d\n\nCaesarean babies have lower level of 'good' gut bacteria, study shows Read more\n\nPreviously it was thought that babies\u2019 microbiomes might be shaped by bacteria that they swallow while in the birth canal. But the latest findings revealed that the microbiome of vaginally delivered newborns did not come from vaginal bacteria but from the mother\u2019s gut \u2013 presumably picked up at the moment of birth.\n\nThis calls into question the practice of swabbing babies born by C-section with vaginal bacteria straight after birth.\n\n\u201cThe practice of vaginal seeding is quite controversial,\u201d said Peter Brocklehurst, a professor of women\u2019s health at the University of Birmingham and a co-author. \u201cHere we find no biological evidence that it would be effective anyway.\u201d\n\nBabies are sterile when they are in the womb, but as soon as they are exposed to the outside world they begin taking in bacteria, which rapidly colonises the gut. By six to nine months, the differences between the two groups had levelled out.\n\nBut scientists think that the initial exposure to bacteria at the moment of birth could be a \u201cthermostat\u201d moment for the immune system, defining its sensitivity and which strains of bacteria trigger a response.\n\nScientists are yet to uncover the exact mechanisms by which early exposure influences immune activity, and this needs to be worked out before the findings have any real implications for clinical practice.\n\nBrocklehurst said it would not be advisable for parents try to give caesarean-born babies a dose of maternal gut bacteria, for instance, which could be dangerous.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be very anxious about deliberately introducing those artificially,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, in the future it may become routine to administer a dose of bacteria to babies born through caesarean.\n\nExperts also said the findings should not alarm women who were planning to have, or had had, a caesarean. \u201cIn many cases, a caesarean is a life-saving procedure and can be the right choice for a woman and her baby,\u201d said Alison Wright, a consultant obstetrician and vice-president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.\n\n\u201cThe exact role of the microbiome in the newborn and what factors can change it are still uncertain, so we don\u2019t think this study should deter women from having a caesarean.\u201d\n\nThe study also suggested that antibiotics, which are normally given before a caesarean, play a role in shaping the baby microbiome. Breastfeeding also had an impact on gut bacteria, the study found, but played a more minor role.\n\nThe study, published in Nature, took seven years and involved taking 1,679 faecal samples from nearly 600 babies and 175 mothers. These were posted to the Sanger Institute in Cambridgeshire and entered into a frozen archive.\n\nThe team wants to expand the study to include larger numbers of babies, including those born at home. They also want to look in more detail at how long hospital bugs with antimicrobial resistance persist, and whether this poses any risk to babies born through caesarean.\n\nAndrew Shennan, professor of obstetrics at King\u2019s College London, said: \u201cThis important study confirms that the way we give birth will alter our microbiome in the first year of life. Caesarean delivery results in fewer bacteria in the baby\u2019s gut being like its mother\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThis is not known to be harmful and mothers who need a caesarean should not be alarmed. The further effects of this in long term health need to be evaluated.\u201d", "description": "C-section babies pick up more hospital bacteria than those born vaginally, research shows", "authors": ["Hannah Devlin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d159d2a5d847816f4cf8a4a2451dc823b1806fee/0_65_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=51ee19daee25d403641fba22dcb456bb", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
