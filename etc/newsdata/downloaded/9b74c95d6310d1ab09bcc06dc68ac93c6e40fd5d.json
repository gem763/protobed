But it\u2019s hard to tell exactly what\u2019s causing the outage, or how long until it will be fixed \u2014 and AT&T is saying conflicting things about what\u2019s going on.\n\nHere\u2019s what the company told us, when we asked:\n\n\u201cA recent software update to some devices may be affecting our customers\u2019 voicemail. We are working with the device manufacturer to issue a patch to resolve this and apologize for any inconvenience this has caused.\u201d\n\nThat statement suggests that only a single phonemaker is affected, and that phonemaker might share the blame for the outage \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t make sense, because AT&T customers are reporting a wide array of different phones are having the same issue, and AT&T\u2019s been telling those user different stories about what\u2019s actually going on.\n\nRight now, there\u2019s a 40+ page thread on AT&T\u2019s support forums concerning the recent voicemail issues. (It was marked as \u201csolved\u201d on page 8 by AT&T.) In the thread, AT&T reps have attributed the issues to something much different than a recent software update \u2014 they\u2019ve said it\u2019s because of a \u201cvendor server problem,\u201d as first stated on October 9th, and reiterated as recently as today, October 23rd:\n\nToday, AT&T support reps also said that the voicemail issues are affecting customers in \u201cmultiple markets.\u201d I\u2019ve seen in the thread that this has apparently affected users in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Nevada, and North Carolina, among other potential locations.\n\nSome disgruntled customers say they filed complaints with the FCC. One who did said they were contacted by AT&T\u2019s office of the president soon after, which allegedly told them that the outage affected AT&T subscribers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and \u201cparts of Indiana,\u201d and said the issue was \u201cgrowing.\u201d\n\nThe office also reportedly offered two solutions to get voicemail working again: just wait for the outage to be fixed, or have their mailbox rebuilt, which would delete any saved messages or messages they had received during the outage.\n\nI tried calling AT&T\u2019s office of the president myself, but when I identified myself as a reporter for The Verge, I was told to speak to AT&T\u2019s public relations team.\n\nI tried to figure out if this is affecting Android or iOS devices more. In my rough estimation from reading the thread, Samsung phones seem to have had voicemail issues more than any other type of phone. However, people have also reported problems on iPhones, Pixels, Motorola phones, and even a Pantech flip phone. It should be noted, though, that the skew toward Samsung may be because the thread is in AT&T\u2019s Android support forums.\n\nComplaints aren\u2019t just confined to this support thread, by the way \u2014 people are venting on Twitter, and we were tipped off to this story in the first place by an unhappy AT&T customer.\n\nWe can\u2019t take customer posts on the internet as proof there\u2019s a widespread issue, but the volume of reports over the past month and statements from AT&T itself suggests that AT&T may be experiencing a big problem \u2014 and if it\u2019s as bad as it seems, it might take more than a single software update to fix it.", "description": "AT&T has been experiencing a weeks-long voicemail outage affecting customers across the country.
