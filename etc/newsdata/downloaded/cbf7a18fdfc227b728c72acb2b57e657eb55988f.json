What a shame that this needs to be said.", "description": "As a combat veteran of the War on Terror, it\u2019s distressing to me that the death of al-Bagdhadi is being poisoned by partisanship.", "authors": ["Rob Smith"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/al-Baghdadi-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
