Not least is the unambiguous finding that Mr. Trump urged a foreign leader to investigate a political rival.\n\nBut in a presidency pocked with the less-than-regal vocabulary of this Washington moment \u2014 tweets about witch hunts and hoaxes, liars and leakers \u2014 the document is also striking for its window into the singular verbal tics and strategic instincts of the executive speaker: part flattery-laden banter (\u201cYour economy is going to get better and better I predict\u201d), part foreboding ambiguity (\u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation\u201d).\n\nThis is the new language of American diplomacy, a high-level conversation between two world leaders that can feel lifted from a Manhattan real estate deal \u2014 or from a B-movie script about Manhattan real estate deals.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to make it look like he\u2019s not asking,\u201d said Barbara A. Res , a former executive vice president of the Trump Organization. \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018I want you to.\u2019 It\u2019s \u2018it would be good of you,\u2019 \u2018it would be helpful.\u2019 And I\u2019ve seen him do that before. He did that with his people when he wanted you to do something that was questionable so that he could say that he didn\u2019t say it.\u201d\n\nTo surmount this obstacle, Mr. Trump seemed to rely in his call on a well-worn sleight of attribution: i nsisting that the thing he wants to talk about is actually a thing that everybody is talking about \u2014 in this case, the would-be corruption of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son.", "description": "How the president deploys his \u201cbuddy-buddy\u201d diplomatic vernacular.", "authors": ["Matt Flegenheimer"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/us/politics/25transcript-language/25transcript-language-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
