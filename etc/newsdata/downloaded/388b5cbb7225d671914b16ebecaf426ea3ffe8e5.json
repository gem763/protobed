Excruciating pain of every kind, frequent nausea, utter exhaustion, dizziness, heart damage, and depression. It\u2019s a severe test of one\u2019s resolve that can last for months after treatment. But what if there were a drug that could make these vanish, or at least ease them, substantially? What a godsend that would be.\n\nWell, recent research strongly suggests that such a drug could be on the way.\n\nAdd \u201csenescent cells\u201d to your vocabulary\n\nAs we age, our cells naturally divide less and less frequently\u2014and then divide no more, entering a state called senescence. Studies suggest that 50 is the maximum number of divisions in an average lifetime. It\u2019s not yet clear why there\u2019s a limit, but what\u2019s important is that these senescent cells are by no means just lying around doing nothing.\n\nOnce they reach their senescent state, they keep busy releasing an unhealthy array of proteins and various compounds known to cause inflammation. And, as we know, inflammation is the likely point of origin for almost every disease we study. And, as we age, and our immune systems weaken, and the number our of senescent cells increases, so does the incidence of inflammation becoming chronic. A veritable welcome mat for multiple diseases.\n\nSo senescent cells can not only do some very serious damage to surrounding tissue. They\u2019re also thought to be responsible, in part, for those horrific side effects of chemotherapy. And that\u2019s not all. We\u2019re seeing evidence that strongly links senescent cells to a growing list of age-related diseases, including:\n\nMuscle wasting\n\nCataracts and glaucoma\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s\n\nOsteoporosis and arthritis\n\nHeart failure and high blood pressure\n\nCancers\n\nLung, liver, kidney and skin disorders\n\nMice with an unhealthy glow\n\nFor a closer look, a research team in the Netherlands genetically engineered a strain of mice so their senescent cells would light up, or fluoresce. They then gave the mice cancer, and gave them one of four common chemotherapy drugs: doxorubicin, cisplatin, paclitaxel or temoz.\n\nResults?\n\nThe chemotherapy increased the number of senescent cells in the mice. In places where they weren\u2019t really expected.\n\n\u201cWe saw senescence everywhere: in the liver, lung, heart, skin and fat,\u201d says team leader, Marco Demaria. The mice also started showing typical chemo side effects, becoming less active and developing problems with their hearts and bone marrow, for instance.\n\nIn another experiment, a week after they had received chemotherapy, mice were given a drug that kills senescent cells. Guess what? Their side effects were alleviated. The mice shrugged off their fatigue, became more active, and didn\u2019t develop any of the health problems common in the other mice. \u201cWe are able to interfere with multiple side effects at the same time,\u201d says Demaria.\n\nAnd better still, these mice were also less likely to have their cancer return later on\u2014a problem that\u2019s been plaguing powerful cancer therapies since forever. Imagine what a relief it would be to hear \u201cYour cancer is in remission\u2014for keeps.\u201d\n\nThe team next analyzed blood cells from women with breast cancer. Bingo again. Women with higher blood levels of senescent cells before chemo had more severe side effects during and after chemo.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear by now that purging senescent cells might help guard against unpleasant side effects among chemo patients.\n\nBut it gets better.\n\nA silver bullet?\n\nHere\u2019s where research and evidence team up to present the possibility of new treatments. In this instance, a new treatment that\u2019s beginning to look like a silver bullet, that one researcher says \u201c\u2026would revolutionise the way medicine is practised.\u201d\n\nGet My FREE Curcumin Report Chronic Inflammation Decoded\n\nWow. Clear-eyed, cautious, methodical research experts don\u2019t often make such sweeping statements.\n\nSo here\u2019s why Judith Campisi, at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in California, is so excited.\n\nSuper-mice? Super-people next?\n\nOld mice that were cleared of senescent cells became like-new \u201csuper-mice.\u201d\n\n\u201cTreated mice,\u201d Campisi says, \u201cwere stronger in old age, and looked younger, with plumper, less wrinkled skin.\u201d\n\nTake a deep breath and ponder that for a moment.\n\nBeing stronger, looking younger, being free of typical age-related disease, and for some, free of chemo side effects\u2014aren\u2019t these the dreams of almost every person of advanced age?\n\nAre we homing in on a single, omnipotent intervention that could make chemo less horrible while attacking and eliminating many, even all, age-related diseases?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the dream,\u201d says Ms. Campisi. \u201dInstead of seeing separate specialists for heart disorders, cancer and dementia, a single doctor would take a more holistic, preventive approach to your health.\u201d\n\nShould that come to pass, we\u2019re indeed looking at \u201crevolutionary\u201d change.\n\nA work in progress\n\nSuch promise. But one cell type does not fit all just yet. While the research you\u2019ve just read about tempts us to roll out the nearest senescent cell killer, it\u2019s not, of course, that simple. Our amazing bodies often beckon us down a road to health-rich returns, only to throw up a roadblock or a detour later on.\n\nIn this case, along with the damage they can cause, senescent cells do a lot of good things \u2013 important things.\n\nSome senescent cells for example, can spot a young cancer cell that normally would grow into a tumor. The senescent cells attack and eliminate the threat.\n\nOthers can detect when nearby tissue is in some sort of trouble, and issue a call for help\u2014sort of a cellular neighborhood watch. It\u2019s not a great leap to accept that they may also play a part in healing wounds and other trauma. We wouldn\u2019t want to lose those benefits.\n\nNot surprisingly, there\u2019s tremendous interest in finding out how anti-senescent drugs could work alongside other drugs. Though some drug-drug interactions are dangerous, others are helpful in achieving better outcomes than a single drug can achieve on its own.\n\nBack to the labs\n\nWe can be sure that our dedicated research scientists and clinicians are exploring every possible way to get senescent cells to do their best work, while also changing their unwanted bad habits. With a little luck, today\u2019s promising leads will turn into tomorrow\u2019s \u201cmiracle\u201d drugs.\n\nReferences\n\nDid You Enjoy This Article?
