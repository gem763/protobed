The problem is, if he actually gets away with it, then we all have a problem,\" he said. \u201cThe gall of the people around him who actually defend him, these Republicans, is appalling, and we must do something about it.\u201d\n\nHe continued the theme when talking about Trump's relationship with the media.\n\n\"It\u2019s a resentment of people (who are) writing about what we see is obvious gangsterism. They don\u2019t like that, so they say, \u2018(Expletive) you, we\u2019re going to teach you people. ' \" he said. \"People who have common sense and see what is happening in this world, and in this country, they cannot do it. It\u2019s a shame, it\u2019s a shame that (the Republicans) behave so badly.\u201d\n\nThis isn't the first time De Niro has spoken out about Trump.\n\nIn September, he told Brian Stelter on CNN's \"Reliable Sources\" that he believed Democrats had \"no choice\" but to impeach the president.\n\n\"There's no way around it,\" the actor said. \"This guy has done everything possible, much worse than I ever thought, ever. The day after he was elected, I said, 'Well, I'll give him a chance. You never know.' He is worse than I ever could have imagined. ... This guy should not be president, period.\"\n\nAt the 2018 Tony Awards, De Niro made headlines when he exclaimed, \"(Expletive) Trump!\" onstage, though censors bleeped him before his cursing made it to the broadcast.\n\nContributing: Hannah Yasharoff\n\nMore: Robert De Niro drops F-bombs in CNN interview about a Trump impeachment and Fox News\n\nMore: Trump foes Kathy Griffin, Bette Midler celebrate formal impeachment inquiry\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/11/robert-de-niro-trump-gangster-cant-wait-see-him-jail/3942631002/", "description": "In an interview with The Guardian, actor Robert De Niro, 76, said he \"can\u2019t wait to see (President Donald Trump) in jail.\"", "authors": ["Sara M Moniuszko", "Published A.M.
