Rachel Humphreys reports from party conference. Plus Vince Beiser on the black market in sand\n\nThis week the Liberal Democrats met amid a backdrop of political chaos and a looming general election. In her first conference as Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson has laid out a decisive Brexit position \u2013 that if her party wins an election it will revoke article 50 and stop Brexit.\n\nMembers voted to endorse Swinson\u2019s proposed policy, though the plan has encountered some internal opposition, with one Lib Dem MP, Sir Norman Lamb, saying he was worried such a proposal could stoke divisions.\n\nRachel Humphreys travelled to Bournemouth to see the former Conservative MP Phillip Lee and former Labour MP Luciana Berger take part in their first Lib Dem conference. She talks to the Guardian political correspondent Peter Walker about whether the Liberal Democrats\u2019 strategy of revoke and remain can pay off.\n\nAnd: the journalist Vince Beiser on the fatal consequences of sand being sold on the black market", "description": "Rachel Humphreys reports from the Lib Dem conference with the party hoping for a resurgence.
