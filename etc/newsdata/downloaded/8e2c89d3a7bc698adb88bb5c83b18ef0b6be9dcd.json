Before a section on hate crime begins, an alert flashes up on screen saying: \u2018Warning!\u2019 in large letters.\n\nIt then says: \u2018Please be aware that this package uses real life examples and, as a result, has offensive language and views in it.\n\n\u2018Swear words are spelt out in full. Swear words are spoken in full in the audio files.\n\n\u2018If you feel that this language is not acceptable to you, please close the package down and speak with your supervisor about how to proceed with completing the training.\u2019\n\nIt is understood the warning was issued following a complaint by a distressed junior officer.\n\nFor some years, trigger warnings have been issued by universities to students who might encounter potentially offensive subject matter while studying subjects such as far Right groups and eating disorders.\n\nGlasgow University theology students, for instance, were warned that they might see distressing images while studying the crucifixion of Jesus.\n\nBoris Johnson has pledged to introduce an extra 20,000 officers over the next three years, but a recent Home Office report suggested forces were struggling to recruit because so many young people are \u2018wrapped in cotton wool\u2019 and unprepared for the harsh realities of the world (file photo)\n\nBoris Johnson has pledged to introduce an extra 20,000 officers over the next three years, but a recent Home Office report suggested forces were struggling to recruit because so many young people are \u2018wrapped in cotton wool\u2019 and unprepared for the harsh realities of the world.\n\nThe report, entitled the Front Line Review, said: \u2018Participants gave examples of recruitment interviews where candidates had stated they do not like confrontation or were shocked by the need to work different shift patterns and possibilities of cancelled rest days.\u2019\n\nFrank Furedi, emeritus professor of sociology at the University of Kent, said: \u2018This is very worrying. It is one thing for fragile 19-year-old sociology students to be easily offended, but when you have policemen and women maintaining law and order getting distressed by harsh language then you have a big problem.\u2019\n\nHampshire police were approached for comment but did not reply.", "description": "Chiefs at one force are warning officers they may be upset by 'swearing'.
