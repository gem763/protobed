Bernstein analysts.\n\nAt that rate, Bernstein projects WeWork could run out of cash to maintain its current plans by mid-next year.\n\nBernstein estimates that WeWork needs at least at least $6 billion in funding.\n\nAs the end of June, WeWork was sitting on $2.5billion in cash.\n\nIt has $1.5 billion coming in next year under an earlier deal struck with SoftBank, the Japanese investment firm.\n\nThe company's revenue has more than doubled annually over the last few years, reaching $1.8billion in 2018, mostly through lease acquisitions.\n\nThe communal office space company is in the midst of a shake-up after reporting huge losses\n\nBut its losses have mounted almost as quickly, reaching $1.6 billion last year.\n\nWeWork was founded in 2010 and makes money by leasing buildings and dividing them into office spaces to sublet to members.\n\nIt has locations in 111 cities worldwide and had planned to launch in 169 addition cities, plans that will likely now be pared down.\n\nWeGrow is a for-profit private school that teaches elementary school-aged children and preschoolers starting at age 2.\n\nTuition at the school can reach up to $48,000 per student, according to The Daily Beast.\n\nIt had been run by Rebekah Neumann, wife of WeWork's co-founder Adam Neumann who last month stepped down as the company's CEO.\n\nThe school was part of the communal ethos that the Neumanns had promoted as the guiding principle of their company.\n\nThe program includes yoga, meditation, trips to a Staten Island farm and mentorships with WeWork's members.", "description": "A New Age-themed elementary school (inset) founded by former WeWork CEO Adam Neumann (right) and his wife, Rebekah Paltrow (left), will be shuttered, the company said.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/05/19617188-0-image-a-92_1570854931002.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
