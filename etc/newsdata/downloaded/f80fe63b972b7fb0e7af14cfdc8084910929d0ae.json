In the clip, several teens outline their aspirations for the future, which range from personal to quite political and belligerent.\n\n\u201cWe will employ the Indian Army to clean the streets,\u201d one student says, while another one threatens the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the paramilitary wing of India\u2019s ruling party, and pledges to \u201cavenge the death of every single Muslim\u201d at their hands.\n\nAlso on rt.com Pakistani PM Khan slams media\u2019s \u2018double standard\u2019 on Hong Kong and Kashmir\n\nThe event that was promoted by the video was dedicated to Kashmir, and India\u2019s move to strip decades-old autonomy from the part of the disputed region it currently controls. Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba seems to have big plans for a future conquest in response to the move, since the slogan of the convention, which was held last Saturday, was \u201cWhen Hind will become Pakistan.\u201d\n\nIndians were not thrilled with the promo, according to reactions on social media. Journalist Naila Inayat, whose post of the clip has since gone viral, said the children in it were part of a brainwashed generation.\n\nThis is yet another brainwashed generation of Pakistani children dreaming of conquering India. Old chooran, same old delusions. pic.twitter.com/ACV2mZzfHP \u2014 Naila Inayat \u0928\u093e\u092f\u0932\u093e \u0907\u0928\u093e\u092f\u0924 (@nailainayat) October 13, 2019\n\n\u201cOur kids want to become doctors, engineers, army officers, pilots, scientists and what not. But here they are still selling the dream of Jehad and capturing India,\u201d one of the commenters said.\n\nOur kids want to become doctors, engineers, army officers, pilots, scientists and what not. But here they are still selling the dream of Jehad and capturing India. They have lost a full generation to this propaganda, it's a loss for Pakistan. Feel sorry for them and the thinking. \u2014 Jayanta Deb (@Jayantakrdeb) October 13, 2019\n\n\u201cPoor kids. Someone show them the reality of life,\u201d another one said.\n\nPoor kids. Someone show them the reality of life. India is no halwa ki aise hi kha lega koi....\n\nI have not met any Indian who wants to conquer pakistan. All Indians want is peace. Leave Kasmir alone and it settles down everything. May God guide all. \u2014 ideasingh \ud83e\udd1f (@ideasingh) October 13, 2019\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
