The 2019 State of Nature report found that 41 per cent of the UK\u2019s species have declined since 1970, with climate change being one of the main drivers.\n\nSimultaneously, as a country, we have lost 97 per cent of our meadows since the Second World War, 80 per cent of our chalk grasslands, and more than half of our ancient woodland \u2013 all of which are vital habitats for wildlife and effective carbon sinks.\n\nWhen nature is managed well, it takes carbon out of the atmosphere and wildlife is able to flourish. A prime example of this is peatland \u2013 which covers 12 per cent of the Britain's land area, is a refuge for numerous rare species, and contains more carbon than the forests of the UK, France and Germany combined.", "description": "Nature has a vital \u2013 though often overlooked \u2013 role to play in preventing the worst impacts of climate change.", "authors": ["Roger Gale", "William Hague", "Ben Bradley", "Madeline Grant"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2019/10/15/Squirrel_Overlay_transparent-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.png?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
