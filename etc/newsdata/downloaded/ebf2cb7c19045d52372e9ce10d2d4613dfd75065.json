Good luck out there trying to keep Windows 10 updated and not breaking everything.\u2019\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella (Photo: AP)\n\nOther people claimed the update had \u2018broken\u2019 their start menu, showing a \u2018critical error\u2019 message.\n\nA Reddit user wrote: \u2018Windows update supposed to fix issue with X causes more issues with X\n\n\u2018Windows update breaks the start menu.\n\n\u2018How come these two things are so common recently, especially the start menu breaking?\u2019\n\nThe problems have caused a lot of wailing and gnashing of teeth on Twitter.\n\nA coder called Joonas Loppi wrote a tweet addressed to Microsoft which asked: \u2018Do you do any testing? There have been many reports recently of you shipping s*** updates to customers.\u2019\n\nIf you\u2019re affected by the problems, you can either uninstall the software or wait for the inevitable fix which will be issued in the coming days or weeks\n\nLast month, Microsoft admitted that a bug in Windows 10 was causing major problems with victims\u2019 computers.\n\nThe update was called Windows 10 KB4512941 and is alleged to make some people\u2019s CPU run wild, meaning their whole system slows down.\n\nSome users affected by the glitch were also prevented from using the Windows Search option near the start menu.\n\nNow Microsoft has vowed to solve the issue and said a fix is on the way.\n\nOn its support page, the tech firm wrote: \u2018Microsoft is getting reports that a small number of users may not receive results when using Windows Desktop Search and may see high CPU usage from SearchUI.exe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018This issue only occurs on devices that have disabled searching the web using Windows Desktop Search.\n\n\u2018We are working on a resolution and estimate a solution will be available in mid-September.\u2019\n\nIt was claimed the problem lies with Cortana \u2013 Microsoft\u2019s voice assistant.\n\n\u2018I just installed KB4512941 and now Windows Search is broke and Cortana process in task manager takes 90% CPU,\u2019 a Windows user wrote on Reddit.\n\nOn Twitter, one gamer shared his pain after the update stopped his favourite game from working properly.\n\n\u2018Very cool that Skyrim is broken,\u2019 he wrote.\n\n\u2018Yet another thing Windows updates have ruined for me. They\u2019ve taken everything from me.\u2019\n\nLuckily, Microsoft has now turned out automatic updates meaning new software won\u2019t be rammed onto your computer without express permission.", "description": "Furious users say the latest software is bringing pain and sorrow to their desktop.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/windows-10-505c_1570447961.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
