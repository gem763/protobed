You\u2019re not going to be able to persuade unless you connect with people emotionally. Now, what\u2019s interesting is he wrote that two thousand years ago. What we\u2019re learning today in the lab and through scientific experiments with MRI machines, is that... no one can make a decision without having emotion affect them. So if you cannot connect to people emotionally, you\u2019re losing a big part of persuasion and you\u2019ll be far less influential and effective.\n\nOn how to overcome public speaking anxiety:\n\nYou have to practice under stress. This is what psychologists, especially people who are in sports psychology, the folks who work with field goal kickers and in football or for golfers staring over a two foot putt putt to win the championship. The reason why they can remain fairly calm in those situations is because they practiced it a thousand times and they practice under mild stress. When it comes to public speaking, you have to get up, record yourself and have a group in front of you. How about one or two people in front of you, maybe friends or peers. In that way you\u2019re practicing under, again, mild stress.\n\nFor more of Carmine\u2019s public speaking tips and to hear Claire\u2019s story of overcoming her own stage fright, we recommend listening to the podcast.
