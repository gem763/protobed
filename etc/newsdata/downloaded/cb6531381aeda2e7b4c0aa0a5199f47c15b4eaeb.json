Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has offered her take on a handful of candidacies and worked with several White House hopefuls on legislation.\n\nWhy it matters: Since her improbable 2018 win over Rep. Joe Crowley, at the time the No. 4 House Democrat, Ocasio-Cortez has become a household name. The freshman lawmaker has 5.5 million Twitter followers, giving her commentary influence. Her district is 49% Hispanic and heavily Democratic. However, many consider her, as a democratic socialist, the face of the far-left. Just how desirable her favor would be to more moderate candidates is unclear.", "description": "The freshman representative has yet to endorse a candidate for the Democratic nomination.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/Wkqs28nnAYgNakk_GvNHzWbsAoc=/0x309:5047x3148/1920x1080/2019/07/10/1562794858600.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
