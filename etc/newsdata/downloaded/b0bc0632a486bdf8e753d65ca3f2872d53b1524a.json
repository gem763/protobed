On the same night, plain clothes police officers fired live rounds at the sky in warning to protesters who chased and hurled objects at them. Facebook/Lostdutch, Reuters\n\nThis past weekend (Aug 31-Sept 1) was the 13th weekend Hong Kong\u2019s anti-extradition bill protesters took to the streets to voice their demands.\n\nWhat started out as a largely peaceful demonstration in July has now evolved into a weekly show of violence and bloodshed, especially on the city\u2019s extensive MTR railway network.\n\nOver the weekend, Hong Kong\u2019s most radical protesters again showed they were unwilling to step back from their demands, and have evolved their tactics to deal with police.\n\nHong Kong police, too, continued their unwavering no-nonsense stance in their treatment of protesters, despite facing flak over an alleged pellet shooting incident which left a woman seriously injured in one eye.\n\nNonetheless, the chaos has not seemed to deter Hong Kong citizens from stepping out to form and join rallies and demonstrations. South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported that as many as 10,000 secondary school students are skipping the first day of the school year on Monday (Sept 2) for a rally in the Central district.\n\nStudents protest on the first school day. That\u2019s their determination.

By 3.30pm, SCMP estimated that tens of thousands of protesters were now on the streets.\n\ncaption Demonstrators at one of the protests in Hong Kong on August 31, 2019. source Reuters\n\nAccording to SCMP, police warned people at an illegal march on a main thoroughfare several times that they were taking part in an unlawful assembly.\n\nRead also: Thousands of Hong Kong protesters are defying a police ban and being met with tear gas and water cannons\n\nPepper spray and tear gas is used at the Legislative Council, after police say protesters threw objects, such as bricks, and pointed laser beams at officers. The crowd later smashes its way into the compound, set fire to barricades and throw petrol bombs at police.\n\nPolice then fired blue dye at protesters so they can be easily identified later.\n\ncaption Riot police use water cannon to disperse anti-extradition bill demonstrators during a protest in Hong Kong, China, August 31, 2019. source Reuters\n\nRead also: Hong Kong police are spraying protesters with blue-dye water cannons to mark them for arrest later\n\nProtesters vandalise, bash MTR stations\n\nMTR Corporation said that it had filed a police report, after protesters vandalised part of a station and threw projectiles onto train tracks, causing services to be suspended.\n\nAs night drew near, protesters on the move continued to vandalise MTR stations by smashing a CCTV camera and spray painting ticket machines black. SCMP reported that some also forced the gates open so other protesters could board the trains without paying a fare.\n\ncaption An anti-extradition bill protester smashes MTR facility as they accuse the railway operator of helping the government to catch protesters, at Tung Chung, in Hong Kong, China September 1, 2019. source Reuters\n\nIn total, around 44 stations are said to have been damaged over the weekend, with at least 32 bashed on Saturday alone.\n\nProtesters start fires on roads\n\ncaption Smoke engulfs a street after anti-extradition bill demonstrators set a barricade on fire during a protest in Hong Kong, China, August 31, 2019. source Insert the image source\n\nOn Hennessey Road, protesters throw petrol bombs into a fire, causing explosions. An Oriental Daily reporter described the scene as \u201cvery dangerous\u201d for protesters who were slow to move away from the blaze.\n\nProtesters later start another fire outside the Sogo department store.\n\nUndercover cops fire live rounds\n\nPolice told SCMP that there were undercover police personnel dressed as protesters after men clad in black were spotted dragging protesters towards the police. Upon discovery of the undercover cops, a horde of protesters chase and attack the officers, who then fire a live round into the sky, the Post reported.\n\nDramatic scenes near Victoria Park as a live round was fired by police skywards as a warning shot to protesters. #hongkongprotests Video: SCMP/Kao Shan Shan pic.twitter.com/c2RDpUgPYO \u2014 SCMP Hong Kong (@SCMPHongKong) August 31, 2019\n\nThis was the second time live rounds had been fired in 13 weeks.\n\ncaption A plainsclothes police officer holds a gun while facing demonstrators during a protest in Hong Kong, China August 31, 2019. source Reuters\n\nFight on MTR prompts police to storm train, beat protesters with batons\n\nA large group of protesters at Prince Edward station were caught on video throwing objects and arguing with some elderly men in the MTR. It is unclear what the argument was about but the heated exchange resulted in a fire extinguisher going off in the train after an object was thrown inside.\n\nProtesters and one of the elderly men can be seen waving hammers in a video posted by Facebook user Lostdutch.\n\nSoon after, police raptors from the Special Tactical Squad entered the station and chased protesters while beating them with batons. A video that has gone viral on social media shows the officers chasing a group of four young men and women who cowered and cried as police beat them in a stationary train. Some people can be seen bleeding from the head.\n\nPolice later confirmed 63 arrests were made at Prince Edward and Mong Kok stations, including a 13-year-old boy who was found carrying two petrol bombs and two lighters. According to SCMP, police said they entered the station at the train operator\u2019s request after protestors damaged the MTR control room.\n\nNeedless to say, several train lines were suspended due to the chaos. Three of the stations also remained closed the next day, due to the large-scale damage caused.\n\nThe Hong Kong Free Press (HKFP) also reported that when asked how the raptors distinguished protesters from ordinary commuters, senior superintendent Yolanda Yu said: \u201cWe will use our professional ability to identify whether they are civilians or protesters.\u201d\n\nAccording to HKFP, pro-democracy legislators have labelled the police\u2019s decision to storm the station as \u201clicensed terror attacks\u201d and accused them of \u201cbeating up ordinary citizens indiscriminately\u201d.\n\nTravellers forced to walk to airport\n\nOn Sunday, a planned sit-in at the airport escalated after protesters vandalised parts of the airport and a nearby MTR station in Tung Chung, HKFP reported.\n\nBy around 1:30pm, MTR was forced to suspend the Airport Express line due to the unrest, after trespassers were found on the tracks.\n\nAt wits end, many travellers were forced to hike with luggage in tow on the highways and from as far as Tung Chung, which is around 5km away, SCMP reported. Many flights were delayed as a result of the chaos.\n\ncaption Passengers try to flee as riot police arrives outside the terminals at Hong Kong International Airport on September 1, 2019. source Reuters\n\nRead also: Hong Kong protesters barricaded roads and disrupted trains to and from the airport, forcing travelers to walk\n\nProtesters retreat from airport to Tung Chung\n\nAgain, protesters set up fire barricades to stop police from advancing as they retreated from the Hong Kong International Airport to Tung Chung.\n\nDuring the chaos, radical protesters burnt a Chinese flag and smashed windows at the MTR station.\n\nWith the Tung Chung line suspended, many protesters, who were stranded on Lantau island where the airport is located, decided to walk around 10km in the heavy rain after a typhoon warning was raised.\n\nAccording to SCMP, more than 100 residents in the Tin Shui Wai district engaged in a stand-off with police, after the authority body-searched commuters at the MTR station.\n\nMTR Corporation said in an update on Monday morning that most lines had resumed, with only the Kwun Tong line experiencing delays for slightly over two hours due to \u201cpassengers requesting assistance, train door obstruction, platform screen door operations\u201d.\n\nXinhua warns \u2018end is coming\u2019 for people antagonising China\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua published a commentary that warned \u201cthe end is coming for those attempting to disrupt Hong Kong and antagonise China\u201d.\n\nPublished on Sunday evening, the commentary said that \u201crioters\u201d had \u201cturned a blind eye to people\u2019s freedom by violently obstructing them from going to school and work\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey tried to stir up unrest in Hong Kong and compromise the \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 principle, before spreading the \u2018colour revolution\u2019 into the Chinese mainland.\n\n\u201cHowever, their attempt to \u2018kidnap Hong Kong\u2019 and press the central authorities is just a delusion. No concession should be expected concerning such principle issues,\u201d it said.\n\nThe article continued by warning against crossing \u201cthree bottom lines\u201d. These were, according to the writer, \u201cno one should harm the national sovereignty and security; no one should challenge the power of the central authorities and the authority of the Basic Law of the HKSAR; no one should use Hong Kong to infiltrate and undermine the mainland\u201d.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - After a weekend of havoc, China has warned that \"the end is coming for those attempting to disrupt Hong Kong and antagonise China\"..
