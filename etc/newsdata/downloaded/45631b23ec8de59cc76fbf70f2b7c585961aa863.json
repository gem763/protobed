We have identified areas where we can improve communication and information sharing with other Trusts and organisations, including universities, involved in a patient\u2019s care.\u2019\n\nBecky Marshall had recently started studying at Goldsmiths University in London (Picture: SWNS)\n\nParents Stephen and Jeanette Marshall, 59 and 57, found out daughter Ms Marshall was one of 80 people seen regularly by an overwhelmed mental health nurse in their hometown of Maidstone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInderjit Randhawa, the nurse at Kent and Medway NHS Trust\u2019s primary care mental health team, said she should have been more proactive when dealing with the teen.\n\nIn the nine months before her death, she was left stranded as she attempted to get an in-depth appointment to discuss the dosage of her medication, which she felt was not working.\n\nIn July 2017, she attempted to take her own life before members of the public intervened \u2013 but still did not get an appointment or diagnosis to help manage her mental health.\n\nTwo months later, during a meeting with a mental health worker, she was accidentally told that experts had suggested that she could have emotionally unstable personality disorder, a controversial diagnosis in the UK.\n\nIt is hoped that her death can help future NHS mental health patients (Picture SWNS)\n\nDespite a concerning appointment in September 2017, when Ms Marshall said she imagined her self-harm wounds on her arm transforming into gaping mouths, there was another two-month wait for an appointment, because her need was \u2018downgraded from urgent to routine\u2019.\n\nShe then moved to London and repeatedly tried to get an in-depth appointment with the South London and Maudsley NHS trust.\n\nDr Nighat Yasmeen, who was the last doctor to see her on 8 November 2017, said that an error meant she was only seen for 20 to 30 minutes when the appointment should have taken an hour-and-a-half.\n\nThat meeting was supposed to be an in-depth discussion about her mental health but ended up being a medication review.\n\nExtinction Rebellion launch action plan to blockade London for two weeks\n\nShe died just two weeks later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHelen Greatorex, Chief Executive of Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust, added: \u2018Miss Marshall\u2019s death was a tragedy and we, along with our South London and Maudsley colleagues have committed to a series of actions.\n\n\u2018We have strengthened our approach to supporting people who seek help through their GPs as part of our primary care services. Our aim is to make it as quick and easy as possible for people to get the help they need, when they need it.\n\n\u2018We are working much more closely with the student wellbeing and support services in the colleges and universities across the county, with an emphasis on fast tracking students to the mental health help and support they need.\n\n\u2018Our third key change is a county-wide, Public Health led, Suicide Prevention Project. This work has been nationally recognised and is something that we believe is already saving lives and will continue to do so.\u2019\n\nMs Marshall was seen as a talented and determined artist, photographer and dancer.\n\nIan Bottle, her tutor during a foundation year at the University for the Creative Arts, Canterbury, said she made the most \u2018profound impression\u2019, adding: \u2018Her sensitivity, ambition, intelligence and determination in her work were extraordinary and enabled her to realise the most moving final project.\u2019\n\nSome of Becky\u2019s artwork (Picture: SWNS)\n\nHer tutor said the 19-year-old was \u2018extraordinary\u2019 (Picture: SWNS)\n\nThe youngster also danced and took pictures (Picture: SWNS)\n\nThe evening before she died, Ms Marshall sent her father a text message to say that she loved him, her mother, and younger sister Katy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next day he called and messaged her several times, before using the Find My iPhone function to track her to her room, where her body was discovered.\n\nHe said: \u2018We would like community trusts (and) primary care trusts to look at young people holistically.\n\n\u2018If a person is moving, treat them as a person. There has to be checks, balances, follow-ups and communication between the home NHS trust and the trust they are with at university.\n\n\u2018If you keep passing it down the line, you don\u2019t take accountability. You throw the ball up and there\u2019s no checks to see if someone\u2019s actually caught it.\n\n\u2018But that ball isn\u2019t a ball, it\u2019s a person. It\u2019s a daughter or son or brother or sister.\u2019\n\nMum Mrs Marshall also said universities have a responsibility to warn students if they do not have the ability to care for people\u2019s mental health.\n\nNeed support?
