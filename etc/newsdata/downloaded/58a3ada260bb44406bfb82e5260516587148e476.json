Chris Solari and Graham Couch, Detroit Free Press\n\nEAST LANSING, Mich. \u2014 The situation has reached a critical stage.\n\nMichigan State football has lost three straight games by a combined score of 100-17 and pressure is mounting on MSU coach Mark Dantonio.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just an annoying engine light blinking on a dashboard. This is five-alarm fire time. It\u2019s one thing to lose to Ohio State, Wisconsin and Penn State. It\u2019s another thing to get blown out by them.\n\n\u201cIt is tough to win a football game when you turn it over,\u201d Dantonio said, after Penn State\u2019s 28-7 victory over the Spartans.\n\nActually, it\u2019s tough to win a football game when you score just one touchdown, get a field goal blocked, give up four touchdown passes, average just 2.7 yards per rush, throw two interceptions, play horrendously on special teams and average 31 yards per punt.\n\nOther than that, things are just peachy for the Spartans.\n\nThe root of the problem is Dantonio's stubbornness. He refused to change the coaching staff after last season. He simply moved around coaching assignments. And the Spartans offense has scored just one touchdown in their last two games.\n\n\u201cFootball is a tough game,\u201d Dantonio said. \u201cFootball is a highly complicated, yet basic game I would say. You can complicate it all you want, and it can be as basic as a guy catching a ball or protecting or throwing the ball. From my perspective, we need to execute better. There are things that we can do from a call situation. We've got a lot of the same plays that other people run as well. Timing and who to go to and those type of things, but we will look at everything, we'll address everything, but then on the flip side of things too.\"\n\nWINNERS AND LOSERS: Week 9 led by Oklahoma, Ohio State\n\nFOOTBALL FOUR: As Ohio State rolls and Oklahoma falls, Alabama and LSU ready for showdown\n\nThe Spartans have a bye week to try to regroup.\n\nBut that\u2019s not exactly encouraging, considering recent history. The Spartans had a week off to prepare for Penn State after getting blown out at Wisconsin.\n\nBut the Nittany Lions crushed the Spartans.\n\nNow, the Spartans have a week to get ready to play Illinois. And suddenly, playing against Illinois doesn\u2019t seem so easy, after it showed fight against Michigan, then beat Wisconsin and Purdue.\n\nMichigan State coach Mark Dantonio walks off the field after speaking to players at a timeout during the second half against Penn State at Spartan Stadium in East Lansing, Saturday, Oct. 26, 2019. (Photo: Junfu Han, Detroit Free Press)\n\nIllinois plays Rutgers next week, which means it likely will have a three-game winning streak when it plays MSU.\n\nWhat will happen if the Spartans lose to Illinois?\n\nWith Michigan on the horizon?\n\nIt tells you the state of the MSU program, that Illinois now seems scary for the Spartans.\n\nThat\u2019s why this is critical.\n\n\u201cWe have to get ourselves healed up,\u201d Dantonio said. \u201cWe have a lot of guys who are banged up, nicked up; guys that haven't played. You got to try to get those guys back and you have to stay positive that we are 4-4 \u2013 that's the beauty in it, I guess, if there is any beauty there. The beauty is we're not 2-7, we're 4-4. We got to take that and try to build on those things and get ourselves ready for Illinois.\n\n\"The only way I know how to do that is like I said before \u2014 stay tough, stay tough-minded, stay positive; don't get negative on people, place blame and say it's your fault. Stay positive and build into people and keep grinding. That's the only way I've known how to do it and that's what we'll continue to do.\"\n\nAll kinds of questions are swirling around this program.\n\nBut in many ways, MSU can still control how this ends.\n\nDantonio can cool the critics if the Spartans beat Illinois and Michigan, which just beat down Notre Dame. Then, MSU finishes against Rutgers and Maryland.\n\nSo what would happen if MSU lost to Illinois and Michigan?\n\nYikes.\n\nLike I said, this is critical.\n\n\u201cYou have to play better; you can't beat yourself,\u201d Dantonio said. \u201cYou have to execute. There are certain things when you play a good football team that you cannot do. ... I think as much as anything, recollect yourselves, stay positive with what we're doing. As difficult as everybody wants to say (it is) out there, you can't abandon ship right now \u2013 you can't do that.\"\n\nThe Spartans don\u2019t seem to have a plan right now.\n\nDantonio looked like he was throwing stuff against the wall against Penn State, switching quarterbacks, hoping something would stick.\n\nBut nothing is working right now. The situation is dire.\n\nAnd there are so many issues, spread across the entire team, that there are no easy fixes.\n\nFollow Jeff Seidel on Twitter @seideljeff.", "description": "Michigan State football has a 3-game losing streak and pressure is mounting on coach Mark Dantonio.
