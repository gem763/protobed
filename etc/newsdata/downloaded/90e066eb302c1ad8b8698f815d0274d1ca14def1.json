A damning report showed more than 4.41million patients were stuck on waiting lists in England in August - up by 250,000 from last year. And 662,053 people have waited more than 18 weeks for routine treatments, such as joint replacements - the highest since records began. Health leaders condemned the figures and said they show the NHS could face its worst winter ever with Brexit, harsh weather conditions and flu on the horizon. NHS bosses said trusts up and down the country are working \u2018incredibly hard\u2019 to prepare for the winter and make sure patients are kept safe. But the Royal College of Nursing fears more and more patients are going to be treated in corridors as pressure gets piled on the health service. And the Royal College of Surgeons warned the upcoming winter pressure, Brexit and the NHS pension crisis will create a \u2018perfect storm\u2019 for hospitals this winter. Experts called for 'swift and far-reaching' Government action to get the NHS braced for winter.\n\nProfessor Ted Baker, CQC\u2019s chief inspector of Hospitals, said: \u2018I\u2019m pleased to see that the majority of people surveyed continue to report positively about their experience.\n\n'This is despite the pressures that urgent and emergency care services are under and is a testament to the dedication and hard work of hospital staff across the country.\n\n\u2018However, it is disappointing that in some areas people\u2019s experience continues to fall short.\n\n'We cannot ignore the increasing impact of lengthy waiting times particularly for those patients attending A&E departments.'\n\nHe added: \u2018Patients who are seriously ill and need urgent care should be consistently identified in a timely way, so it is concerning that such a low proportion say they waited 15 minutes or less for an assessment.\n\n\u2018Information provision when leaving hospital and help from staff with pain control were also areas where people were less positive, pointing to the impact of increased demand and pressures on staff who are at full stretch.\n\n\u2018We know there are huge challenges in managing demand for urgent and emergency care services. Emergency departments are under considerable and increasing pressure and need the support of the whole hospital and surrounding local health and social care system to manage the workload.\u2019\n\nChris Graham, chief executive of healthcare charity Picker, which carried out the survey, said: \u2018Today\u2019s findings show only marginal improvements in people\u2019s experiences of emergency and urgent care in the NHS between 2016 and 2018..\n\nThe lack of progress is disappointing given the system\u2019s policy focus on person centred care - but it is also reassuring, given the widely reported pressures on emergency departments, that standards have at least been maintained from the patient perspective.\u2019\n\nAn NHS spokesman said: \u2018This increasingly positive feedback, in the context of 2,400 more attendances at A&E every day in 2018 compared to when the survey was last carried out, is testament to the hard work and skill of the NHS\u2019 growing urgent and emergency care workforce.\u2019", "description": "A survey of 50,000 patients in England revealed thousands were made to wait in pain last year, despite official guidance stating they should be seen in 15 minutes.", "authors": ["Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline", "Eleanor Hayward Health Reporter For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/17/20092870-0-image-a-5_1571848258376.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
