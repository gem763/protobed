Evans, by contrast, began the season outside the top-190 and is currently the 43rd highest ranked male on the planet.\n\nHis climb to the summit of the men\u2019s game in this country is a fine achievement after seeing his ranking vanish entirely less than a year-and-a-half ago after being banned for a year after testing positive for cocaine, and he has applied himself well since returning to the tour.\n\nCameron Norrie could still become British No. 1 this week (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nElsewhere, Canadian left-hander Denis Shapovalov booked a tie with world No. 1 Novak Djokovic after beating Frances Tiafoe 6-4 6-2, while Spain\u2019s Albert Ramos Vinolas beat Marin Cilic 6-4 6-4 to set up a meeting with Roger Federer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTenth seed Fabio Fognini beat America\u2019s Sam Querrey 6-4 6-2 and could face Andy Murray in the second round.\n\nThe British wildcard meets Argentine qualifier Juan Ignacio Londero later on Monday, with Fognini awaiting the winner.", "description": "Kyle Edmund will drop out of the top-50 of the ATP rankings next week and will no longer be British No. 1 following an early exit at the Shanghai Masters....", "authors": ["George Bellshaw"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1172480272_1570441597.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
