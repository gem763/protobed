Who isn\u2019t?\n\nUnfortunately, terrorism does not fall under a single umbrella. It is not just al Qaeda, though all Islamist terrorist groups appear to have the same objective: Kill Americans, weaken the United States, subjugate women, eliminate Israel and impose its version of sharia law across the globe.\n\nThe prospect of a peace agreement would normally be cause for celebration, except in this case U.S. negotiators don\u2019t appear to know who and what they are dealing with. As he ended American involvement in the Vietnam War with the Paris Peace Accords, President Nixon declared \u201cpeace with honor.\u201d It wasn\u2019t long before the Communist North\u2019s takeover of South Vietnam and their murder of \u201ccollaborators.\u201d\n\nA premature U.S. pullout from Afghanistan will fulfill the late Osama bin Laden\u2019s prophecy, which he based on America\u2019s Vietnam experience, that the United States has no staying power and all the terrorists have to do is wait us out.\n\nA Taliban spokesman confirmed this in a statement to the London Times, declaring the group\u2019s unwillingness to even agree to a cease fire, much less a peace deal. \u201cIt is not possible for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will fight. We have fought for 18 years and we will fight for a hundred years. We will continue our \u2018jihad.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere is something else the secular West doesn\u2019t, or worse, refuses to understand. As with some liberal Western leaders who thought promises from communists could be believed, radical Islamists are taught to lie to \u201cinfidels,\u201d if it advances the cause of Islam.\n\nFrom Raymond Ibrahim, writing for Middle East Forum, the Philadelphia-based conservative think tank, \u201cAccording to Sharia (law), in certain situations, deception \u2014 also known as \u2018taqiyya,\u2019 based on Quranic terminology \u2014 is not only permitted but sometimes obligatory. For instance, contrary to early Christian history, Muslims who must choose between either recanting Islam or being put to death are not only permitted to lie by pretending to have apostatised, but many jurists have decreed that, according to Quran 4:29, Muslims are obligated to lie in such instances.\u201d\n\nThe Taliban leadership can be counted on to say to the West whatever it takes to regain power and to possibly again create a haven for terrorists to plot their next attack on the United States.\n\nThe West should never compromise when it comes to the Taliban\u2019s attitude toward women and its desire to return to the days of their complete subjugation to men. Some years ago, I met with a group of Afghan women in New York, who had managed to escape their country when the Taliban ruled. They included teachers, lawyers and businesswomen. These women told horrific stories of life under the Taliban. They were forced to paint over the windows of their homes, forbidden to leave home unless accompanied by a male relative, required to wear burqas in public and should they take a bus anywhere, a male relative had to take the coin from their hands and deposit it in the collection box.\n\nThere is no reform movement among the Taliban, so why doubt the group will return to practicing their interpretation of Islamic law should they have the opportunity?\n\nOne hopes the United States will not consider anything resembling unilateral withdrawal, which is not the way to end a war; victory is.\n\nThe \u201cwar on terrorism\u201d is unique because it is based on religious extremism and its accompanying ideology and a willingness \u2014 even eagerness \u2014 to die for their cause and their god. Should a peace deal eventually be reached without protections that preserve U.S. interests (and American lives), it will only ensure more trouble for the years ahead.\n\n\u2022 Cal Thomas, a nationally syndicated columnist, is the author of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Expiration Date: The Fall of Empires, Superpowers and the United States\u201d (HarperCollins/Zondervan, January 2020).\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
