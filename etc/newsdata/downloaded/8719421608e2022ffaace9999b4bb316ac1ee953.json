REUTERS/Heino Kalis\n\n\u201cI am indebted to France for my life,\u201d said Beryl Roberts from Pontivy, in the north west of the country, who has the French health service to thank for spotting her cancer.\n\n\u201cHowever if there is no more healthcare after Brexit, I will be desperate,\u201d adds the 72-year-old, who is among more than a million Britons living in the EU and facing uncertainty.\n\nTheir biggest concern is over Britain leaving without a deal, which could affect some of the healthcare arrangements enjoyed by Britons living in Europe, many of them pensioners, as well as by more than three million EU citizens in Britain. Allianz Care, which offers an international private medical insurance policy, said enquiries from British citizens, often living in or with properties in France or Spain, had risen by 20% so far this year from the same 2018 period. \u201cIt speaks to the uncertainty. Potential customers have asked lots of questions about cover,\u201d Peter Gibbons, head of individual and small groups at Allianz Care, said.\n\nAXA Global Healthcare and Expatriate Group also report a rise in enquiries, by phone, email or live chat.\n\nAnd in Italy, Jeremy Morgan, vice chairman of expatriate organization British in Europe, is also seeing concern.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re suggesting people voluntarily join the local health service here, or they take out some kind of insurance.\u201d\n\nIn Spain, Sophie Goode was hired by Polifani in 2017 following queries from Britons, who had previously made hardly any enquiries to the insurance broker.\n\nGoode now receives four to six requests for information daily and gives advice about healthcare after Brexit at weekly meetings for expatriates at campsites in Benidorm.\n\nOf every 10 consultations, Goode wins eight clients, including people who qualify for state-backed arrangements.\n\nCOUNTING THE COSTS\n\nHowever, many potential customers are concerned about the cost and are holding off buying health insurance policies until they\u2019re sure they need to, brokers and insurers say.\n\n\u201cWe are saying - at this stage, do not worry,\u201d said Guy Jones, director of broker BD Global Medical.\n\nThe British government last month said 180,000 people already living in the EU who have their healthcare funded by the UK, including pensioners and students, would have their costs covered in the case of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nHowever, the offer only applies for six months.\n\nBritain and Spain have a further arrangement giving people living in each country continued access to local healthcare until at least the end of 2020. Britons working and paying social security in Spain should keep the same access as now.\n\nThe issue could be less pressing if there is a Brexit deal, as Britain and the EU are expected to be covered by transitional arrangements for more than a year, although there remains a lack of clarity over what would happen after this.\n\nBritain and Brussels are in 11th hour talks to try to reach a deal ahead of an EU summit beginning on Thursday.\n\nBritons in Europe also worry health insurance will not cover them for pre-existing conditions.\n\n\u201cI could never afford private healthcare here, as I understand it would be about 8,000 euros a year and exclude my cancer care,\u201d Beryl Roberts said.\n\nBrokers agreed insurance would likely cost several thousand euros a year, and rates usually increase with age.\n\nHealth insurance premiums have also tended to rise sharply in recent years due to increases in medical costs, which Mercer Marsh Benefits said was 9.7% globally in 2018.\n\nBroader international medical insurance policies are more likely than domestic insurance to include pre-existing conditions, offer documents and even online doctors in a variety of languages, and be portable across countries, insurers said.\n\nSlideshow (8 Images)\n\nBut such policies are more expensive, brokers say.\n\nRetired policeman Terry Roberts, 64, lives near Alicante in southern Spain and receives treatment from the Spanish state health system for diabetes and pancreatitis. He is worried he might have to start paying.\n\n\u201cAt the moment it\u2019s making me more ill than I was before. I have to have medication to keep me alive.\u201d", "description": "Some Britons living in the Europe Union are worried about losing access to free healthcare after Brexit, opening up a potentially lucrative new market for European health insurers.", "authors": ["Carolyn Cohn", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441546632&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1K0", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
