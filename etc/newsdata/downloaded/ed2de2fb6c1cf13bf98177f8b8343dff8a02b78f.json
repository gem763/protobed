The crossover episodes see heroes from the network's ever-growing list of comic book adaptions banding together to save the world.\n\nThe special episodes, which are this year entitled \"Crisis on Infinite Earths,\" will span five episodes and include intersecting storylines from \"Arrow,\" \"The Flash,\" \"Supergirl,\" \"DC's Legends of Tomorrow\" and new series \"Batwoman.\" Characters from CW's \"Black Lightning\" will also appear.\n\nThe crossover will reveal what happened to Welling's interpretation of the infamous Man of Steel since \"Smallville\" ended. The series went off the air in May 2011.\n\n\"For eight years, 'Arrow' has stood on the shoulders of 'Smallville,'\" executive producer Marc Guggenheim said in a statement provided to CNN. \"Simply put, there would be no 'Arrow,' and no 'Arrowverse,' without it. So when we first started talking about 'Crisis on Infinite Earths,' our first, second and third priorities were getting Tom to reprise his iconic role as Clark Kent. To say that we're thrilled would be a Superman-sized understatement.\"\n\nRead More", "description": "Tom Welling will play Clark Kent, the role he played on \"Smallville,\" for The CW's \"Arrowverse\" crossoveres between shows like \"Supergirl\" and \"The Flash.\"", "authors": ["Whitney Friedlander"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190919163421-tom-welling-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
