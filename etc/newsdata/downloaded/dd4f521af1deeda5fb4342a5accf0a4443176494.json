I love the show. I\u2019ve watched it my entire life,\u201d she told Extra.\n\nAlthough Trainor\u2019s favorite episode is the one where Rachel writes an 18-page confession \u2015 front and back \u2015 to Ross that he\u2019s too tired to read, she said Chandler is her favorite character \u201cmost of the time.\u201d\n\nTrainor dropped the track Sunday night at 8:30 p.m. EST \u2015 25 years exactly from the sitcom\u2019s debut on NBC.\n\nTo add extra color to the release, Trainor\u2019s track came out just as the Empire State Building in New York City was lit up with the colors red, yellow and blue, which Today.com notes, are the colors of the \u201cFriends\u201d logo.\n\nThe show may have focused on \u201cFriends,\u201d but Trainor\u2019s recording was more of a family affair.\n\n\u201cI actually cut the vocals in my backyard in my studio, with my little brother, my older brother, my husband and my best friend,\u201d she told Rolling Stone. \u201cAnd we were just all laughing and in disbelief. Like, \u2018How is this really happening?\u2019 It was a big party, the best night.\u201d\n\nAdding to the \u201cFriend-liness\u201d is the fact that Trainor\u2019s husband, actor Daryl Sabara, actually appeared on the show\u2019s final season as Owen, the child Chandler accidentally tells he\u2019s adopted.\n\n\u201cWhen he showed me that episode and I remembered it was him, I freaked out,\u201d Trainor said. \u201cIt plays on airplanes when we travel, and we always pop it on and we still scream every time.\u201d\n\nYou can hear Trainor\u2019s take in the video below.", "description": "The singer's version of \"I'll Be There For You\" includes backup vocals by husband Daryl Sabara, who appeared on the sitcom's final season.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88f33a2100000a06eb3c00.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
