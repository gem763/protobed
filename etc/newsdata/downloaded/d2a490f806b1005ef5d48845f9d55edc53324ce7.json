But with the arrival of the Labor Day holiday comes a time-honored transition to a new and more volatile stage of the race. The field is narrowing, the competition growing more sharp.\n\nHow Warren surged past Sanders \u2013 and how he fought back Read more\n\nFormer vice-president Joe Biden has held his early lead despite a season of missteps and gaffes. He is trailed by Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, who has staked out healthcare as his defining issue. But both have lost ground to Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who spent her summer churning out policy plans, working selfie lines and steadily climbing the polls.\n\nRounding out the top tier are the California senator Kamala Harris and South Bend\u2019s mayor, Pete Buttigieg, who used televised events to break through a congested field but have seen their progress stall.\n\nParty leaders and strategists say the race remains fluid at the top as the contenders prepare to share a debate stage in Houston in two weeks\u2019 time.\n\n\u201cThe stakes are higher now but the race is still open,\u201d said Tom Vilsack, secretary of agriculture under Barack Obama and former governor of Iowa. \u201cA spark or a moment during the debate could catapult one of them forward.\u201d\n\nI think Kamala Harris\u2019s supporters are wondering: does she have a second act after the first act was such a success? Bill Galston\n\nPolling last week showed Biden held a comfortable lead at 32%, with Warren and Sanders jostling for second. A USA Today/Suffolk University survey found Warren at 14% and Sanders at 12%; Quinnipiac showed Warren at 19%, four points ahead of Sanders. In both polls, Harris and Buttigieg were the other candidates to top 5%.\n\nBut as Barack Obama and Donald Trump showed in 2008 and 2016, early assumptions and public polling are not always good indicators of who voters will choose.\n\nBiden has an advantage among black voters but faces competition from Harris and the New Jersey senator Cory Booker, the most prominent African American contenders who have targeted his record on race.\n\n\u201cThe nightmare scenario for Joe Biden is that Kamala Harris or Cory Booker emerge very strong in the Iowa caucuses and that leads to an erosion of support among African Americans,\u201d said Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nThe biggest moment of Harris\u2019 campaign so far was the first debate, when she clashed with Biden. But she has faded since. Galston said: \u201cI think Kamala Harris\u2019s supporters are wondering: does she have a second act after the first act was such a success?\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Joe Biden in Prole, Iowa, on 20 August.

His first TV ad hammers the point: \u201cWe have to beat Donald Trump and all the polls agree, Joe Biden is the strongest Democrat to do the job.\u201d But many argue that electability, a calculus that can include gender and racial bias, is not enough on its own.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t nominate someone who we\u2019re not excited about just because we\u2019re afraid and then turn around and ask the rest of the country to get excited about them,\u201d said Heather McGhee, a fellow at the progressive thinktank Demos.\n\nDemocrats are looking for \u201can exciting alternative to not just the last four years but also the last 40 years of rising inequality and insecurity\u201d, McGhee said. \u201cWe need someone who can meet the populist moment.\u201d\n\nThe field crosses the ideological spectrum, from democratic socialist to conservative Democrat; spans four decades in age; includes several women, candidates of color and a gay mayor; and contains veterans and a diversity of faiths and socio-economic backgrounds. That, said Mar\u00eda Urbina, national political director for Indivisible, a progressive grassroots organization, has stoked a \u201creal contest of ideas\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not having just a \u2018binary of good and bad\u2019 debate,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really allows for a serious discussion of the issues. Candidates actually have the space to talk to people, hear their stories and offer solutions.\u201d\n\nOne of the central debates is over how to expand healthcare coverage. Differences between candidates who advocate for a single-payer system and those who want to expand the Affordable Care Act have led to sharp exchanges.\n\nWarren has made economic reform central to her campaign. Sanders champions ideas such as Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. Others have forced conversations on issues such as reparations for slavery, court packing and decriminalizing border crossings.\n\nMichael Steele, a former Republican National Committee chair, believes Democrats must not veer too far left. He argues that moderate and independent voters in battleground states want a candidate who will re-establish order and stability after four years of Trump. A nominee who wanted to overhaul nearly every aspect of the US economy would be a \u201csecond shock to the system\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cThe question is whether or not that\u2019s something that\u2019s palatable to the American public,\u201d he said. \u201cMy bet is it is not.\u201d\n\n\u2018Three Stooges\u2019\n\nThe field has been reduced to 20. The New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand, once seen as a major contender, ended her campaign after failing to qualify for the third debate. Washington governor Jay Inslee, former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper and the Massachusetts congressman Seth Moulton also called it quits.\n\nHalf of the remaining candidates will not debate in Houston, raising serious questions about whether they can win the nomination.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren at the first night of the second Democratic debate in Detroit, Michigan, on 30 July.

Former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld has been joined by former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh, a disillusioned Tea Party star. There are rumblings that former South Carolina governor and congressman Mark Sanford will jump in too.\n\n\u201cCan you believe it?\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cI\u2019m at 94% approval in the Republican party, and have Three Stooges running against me.\u201d\n\nTrump is also watching the Democrats. Tongue firmly in cheek, he said Gillibrand\u2019s exit marked a \u201csad day\u201d, adding: \u201cI\u2019m glad they never found out that she was the one I was really afraid of!\u201d\n\nThe Democratic electorate is so anxious and concerned about the election with Trump Neera Tanden\n\nVoters feel less playful. A USA Today/Suffolk University poll that asked respondents to choose the word that best captured their sentiment ahead of the looming campaign saw just 2% of Democrats saying they were \u201coptimistic\u201d. Only 1% felt \u201cconfident\u201d; 16% said they were \u201cworried, scared, frightened or afraid\u201d.\n\nNeera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning thinktank, said the trauma of 2016 had left Democrats with little appetite for a long primary fight.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic electorate is so anxious and concerned about the election with Trump, that they will start voting strategically to end it in March or April,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want this to go one forever.\u201d\n\nIf Labor Day is the start of a sprint to Iowa and New Hampshire, candidates must not be caught flat-footed. On Monday, Biden will attend picnics in Iowa while Sanders will zip from breakfast in southern Maine to New Hampshire, where he will march in a holiday parade before cooling off at ice cream socials.\n\nWarren will make her 15th visit to New Hampshire, for a house party. Harris will join union members and healthcare advocates at a rally in her home state, California.", "description": "With Labor Day comes a time-honored transition to a more volatile stage of the race \u2013 and Biden has held onto his lead, but Warren and Sanders are right behind", "authors": ["Lauren Gambino"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccdf88a272823f1b697114de6990c8b61a3e6f22/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ac53ecad3a3a3ab17f8cd90d5c77d996"}
