Pictured: with his two children\n\nTrain with focus\n\nAs a father-of-two Lawrence admits that he has to compromise when it comes to his fitness regime now.\n\n'There is most definitely some give and take here, compromise is required by both sides. My wife understands that my training is essential for me to be at my best both professionally and personally - whilst I know that being at home to help the family as often as possible is essential for the kind of family dynamic we want.\n\n'However my freedoms to pop to the gym whenever I choose have definitely reduced as I spend more time being with the family.\n\n'But instead of seeing this as a negative to my training I have turned it on its head by training less frequently but more efficiently.\n\n'Instead of wandering into the gym five times a week for 'general training' sessions, I now go just two or three times a week but ensure that I train with more purpose and focus than ever before - the effect on my training has been positive!\n\n'The urgency of knowing you have less time in the gym to train simply means you have to train smarter with more focus. Training sessions have become more streamlined, warm ups more specific and conditioning more intense. When time is of the essence you simply have to make the most of it!'\n\nAs a trainer for fitness app FiiT he spends time creating workouts you can take anywhere with you\n\nLawrence explains that his presence for a 10 minute workout would be one which involves animal flow movements\n\nWhat are NEAT exercises?\n\n'NEAT stands for Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis i.e. all the non exercise specific energy you expend,' reveals Lawrence.\n\n'This can mean carrying the kids up and down the stairs, doing the endless shopping, walking to and from work - believe me it all stacks up,' says the trainer.\n\n'If you want to remain healthy and lean up as a parent you won't go far wrong by having an A-class neat game, training for 30-40 mins two or three times a week and making nourishing food choices 80 per cent of the time.'\n\nWorkout out with his children: The fitness and his daughter do some fitness moves together in this Instagram snap\n\nThe Fiit Trainer is now one of 20 PT's on the home workout app. Pictured: Before a workout in the sun\n\nAnimal flow movements\n\nLawrence explains that his preference for a 10 minute workout would be one which involves animal flow movements.\n\n'That's 10 minutes of continuously loaded bodyweight exercises that flow through multiple planes of movement.\n\n'This ticks 3 boxes for me - firstly its taking care of my mobility and joint health goals, secondly it is constant weight bearing that is guaranteed to give me a challenging and sweaty resistance workout whilst, lastly, it taps into my brain/body mindfulness practice.\n\n'There may well be certain limitations to what you can achieve in 10 minutes but evidence is showing us that consistency is key - little and often stacks up so if 10 minutes is all you have then grasp it with both hands every time!'\n\nThe fitness trainer and model reveals that results occur with the repeat practice of workouts, short or long, are done well, over time\n\nUse your body weight\n\nThe fitness expert says that humans are designed to move and you don't always need fancy gym equipment. 'Movement is the antidote to many ailments caused by sedentary lifestyle habits of the modern world.\n\n'Knowing how to move in a beneficial way is a powerful tool to have in your locker so take some time learning about your body and how to move it in a way that strengthens it, eases tension and leaves you feeling invigorated and alive.\n\n'The world of tech is providing some amazing solutions for bodyweight training enthusiasts - I'm a trainer for FiiT and we spend so much time creating workouts you can take anywhere with you.'\n\nThe 10 minute workout with only five moves Focus on five exercises which consist of three resistance moves and two isometric core moves Format: 30 seconds each of the following back to back, 4 rounds: (8 mins total) A) Bodyweight Squats B) Press ups C) Burpees D) Rest (4 mins total) A) 4 x 30 second Hollow Hold B) 4 x 30 seconds Side Plank\n\nMotivation when you're tired\n\nLawrence says that motivation is an emotion that comes and goes - some weeks you will feel motivated and other weeks you won't.\n\n'Motivation, much like all other emotions, isn't consistent - so if you rely on it for all your workouts then your training won't be consistent either.\n\n'Structure and ownership of your training is very much a personal mindset that must be developed by the individual - most people have the intent to exercise regularly but many struggle to action out that intent.\n\n'Seek out a support group that you can be accountable to when feeling unmotivated and who share the same battles you face as a parent. Call upon five other friends to commit to training at the same time each week (either in person at a set location or individually at home via online services such as FiiT Club).\n\n'We all feel tired and lacking in motivation to train at times, its completely human and normal - but put yourself into a position where you're part of a community who can own that struggle together...and overcome it.'\n\nLawrence says that motivation is an emotion that comes and goes - some weeks you will feel motivated and other weeks you won't\n\nThe trainer advises you to pick a compound muscle group to work each day and focus on that\n\nConsistency is key\n\nWhether you are an elite athlete or a full time working father looking to remain lean and healthy. Lawrence believes that results occur 'with the repeat practice of workouts, short or long but done well, over time. '\n\n'Depending upon what stimulus you put upon your body it will adapt to it. If you train little and often, but with real purpose, your body will respond. Some changes may be externally visual whilst other changes will be internal health benefits your future self will thank you for.\n\n'My advice is not to scrutinise over progress on a weekly basis but instead to just commit to the lifestyle and allow the results to simply happen i.e. focus on enjoying the process rather than mentally wrestling over the short term outcome.\n\nMake a plan and stick with it\n\nThe trainer advises you to pick a compound muscle group to work each day and focus on that.\n\n'For example on Monday you could choose squats, Tuesday it could be press ups and Wednesday Upper body pull/row. Start with two minutes of preparation mobility work, then do 2 x 4 min EMOMs (a different exercise every minute on the minute) per session.\n\n'You could also do a morning yoga session or even simply enjoy a brisk walk/run around the block if it makes your feel vibrant and energetic before breakfast or after work....whatever gets you moving in a manner that you enjoy!
