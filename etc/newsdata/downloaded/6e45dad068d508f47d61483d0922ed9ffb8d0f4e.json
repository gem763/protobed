A drone attack over the weekend \u2014 carried out by Houthi rebels from Yemen backed by Iran \u2014 reportedly crippled Saudi Arabian crude production by half.\n\nBased on the attack on Saudi Arabia, which may have an impact on oil prices, I have authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, if needed, in a to-be-determined amount.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019\n\nWith the global economy decelerating, crude prices have been entrenched in a bear trend. Yet on Sunday, both international Brent crude (CL=F) and U.S. oil futures spiked by over 10%, as markets anticipated Saudi supply would be at least temporarily crimped by the attack.\n\nThe drawdown of the U.S.\u2019s emergency oil stocks underscored the severity of the situation, and the concerns about global supply. The SPR, which was last tapped in 2011, is an \u201cemergency response tool\u201d used in cases when the loss of global supply is considered disruptive to the world economy.\n\n....sufficient to keep the markets well-supplied. I have also informed all appropriate agencies to expedite approvals of the oil pipelines currently in the permitting process in Texas and various other States. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019\n\nChris Midgley, S&P Global Platts\u2019 head of analytics, said that the ratcheting up of geopolitical tensions warrants an additional $5-$10 premium on global oil prices \u2014 and could break above $70. On Friday, oil settled around $55 per barrel.\n\n\u2018Locked and loaded\u2019\n\nThe unexpected attack on Abaqiq \u2014 a linchpin of Saudi Arabia\u2019s global oil production \u2014 has rattled the markets and stoked new fears about Riyadh\u2019s ongoing conflict with Yemen.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran\u2019s suspected involvement raises questions about whether the U.S. could be draw into a confrontation. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo immediately accused Tehran of masterminding the attack, which the Iranian government denied. Via Twitter, Trump said the U.S. was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d for a potential response.\n\nSaudi Arabia oil supply was attacked. There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019\n\n\u201cUnquestionably, oil prices will be up significantly when the market opens on Monday,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, CEO of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a non-partisan research institute.\n\nGiven the centrality of Abaqiq to Saudi production, the attack \u201cwill have significant impact on the global oil prices,\u201d Dubowitz said.\n\nThe Saudi kingdom is one of world\u2019s largest repositories of oil, churning out around 10 million barrels per day. It was not immediately clear how long it will take for the country to replace the supply lost by the assault on Abaqiq.\n\nGoldman Sachs said in a note on Sunday that a brief outage that lasted no more than a week could boost crude by $3-5. However, Saudi\u2019s oil being offline for two to five weeks could send prices up by as much as $14 per barrel \u2014 and anything longer than that could easily buttress oil above $75, the bank said.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia has a lot of oil in storage now and most likely the attack will not result in a physical shortage of oil,\u201d according to Dubowitz.\n\n\u201cRegardless, there will be a sustained rise in the global oil price, since it is now clear that the Saudi production and export is vulnerable to attacks, and clearly Iran though its surrogate Houthis will continue to strike at Saudi Arabia, as part of its efforts to get out of the sanction regime.\u201d\n\nThe attacks also come as Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil company, Aramco, is preparing to float an initial public offering that could be one of the world\u2019s largest.\n\nAnalysts say that the attack complicates the country\u2019s IPO plans, and raises questions about the long-term security of the country\u2019s reserves from future attacks from rebels, or Iran.", "description": "President Donald Trump said on Sunday he would help offset the expected loss of supply resulting from a drone attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil fields.", "authors": ["Javier E.
