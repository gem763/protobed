(Supplied)\n\nGrowing problem\n\nIt's been a bad month for bedbugs in federal buildings.\n\nTrombetti's note came the same week Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC), which manages government properties, told some Employment and Social Development Canada employees to work from home Friday.\n\nThat request was made so that a pest control company could deal with a bedbug problem at 22 Eddy St. in Gatineau.\n\nPSPC also revealed bedbugs had been spotted on the 16th floor of the Jean Edmonds Tower at 300 Slater St. in Ottawa.\n\nHundreds of federal public servants also had to work from home earlier this month to allow for bedbug treatments at 70 Cr\u00e9mazie Street in Gatineau \u2014 an infestation that had gone on for more than a year.\n\nMagali Picard, national executive vice-president of PSAC, wants the federal government to proactively fight bedbugs in their buildings by, among other things, letting sniffer dogs track them down. (CBC)\n\n'Not isolated cases'\n\n\"These are not isolated cases,\" said Magali Picard, PSAC's national executive vice-president.\n\n\"Employees have a right to feel safe at work, and they're rightfully worried about bringing bedbugs home with them and affecting their families, which is having an impact on their mental health,\" said Picard in a statement to CBC.\n\nThe union would like the federal government to start proactively inspecting its buildings with sniffer dogs, while also creating a registry of buildings contaminated by pests.\n\nThey're also asking them to:\n\nCover fumigation expenses for workers in infested buildings who bring bugs home.\n\nGive them the technological ability to work from home if pests become a problem at their buildings.\n\nAllow workers stay home after fumigation until a follow-up inspection has been made.\n\nTeach them how to identify and report a bedbug problem.\n\nFinally, PSAC said it wants to see the government stop attacking the problem one floor at a time, and fumigate entire buildings when problems persist.\n\n'It's worrying'\n\nSome employees who read the note told CBC their biggest fear is bringing bedbugs home.\n\n\"It's worrying,\" said one woman as she left the building Friday.\n\n\"It's hard to know if you've got some on you or [if] you're bringing them home. I have small children \u2014 I don't want my kids to be subject to bedbugs in my own home.\"\n\nTrombetti wrote in her email that the building's property management team and the workplace health and safety committees were both \"taking this issue seriously.\"\n\n\"As a precaution, we have installed pheromone glue traps on the floor to monitor the situation,\" she wrote.", "description": "As a Tunney's Pasture tower becomes the latest government\u00a0building in the National Capital Region flagged for bedbugs, Canada's\u00a0largest federal workers' union is demanding a more proactive strategy to deal with the pests.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5336920.1572134596!/fileImage/httpImage/image._gen/derivatives/16x9_620/jeanne-mance-building-tunney-s-pasture.", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
