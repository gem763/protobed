Jollyamma Thomas, a.k.a Jolly Thomas, was arrested along with M.S. Mathew and P. Prajikumar who have been named as her accomplices. The crimes came to light when her NRI brother-in-law, Roji Thomas, grew suspicious of a fake will she presented and urged the Kerala police to act.\n\nJolly poisoned the six members of her family by serving them food laced with potassium cyanide, a poison. The first victim was her mother-in-law, Annamma Thomas, who died back in 2002 but everyone suspected it was of old age. Her father-in-law Tom Thomas passed away six years later with the initial reports suggesting heart failure. In 2011, Jolly\u2019s husband Roy Thomas expired following which, in 2014, Annamma\u2019s brother, Mathew Manjadiyil left this earthly plane too.\n\nThe deaths didn\u2019t stop there. In 2014, Roy's cousin, Shaju\u2019s two-year-old child, Alphine died mysteriously with reports saying she died due to choking. Her mother Silli died a few months later. Jolly went on to marry Shaju.\n\nThe reasons behind these cold-hearted murders were to cover up Jolly\u2019s extra marital affairs and a bid to grab the family property. It was found that Jolly was using a forged identity card of the NIT-C to create the impression that she was a lecturer there.\n\n\"We have arrested her and two associates in the murder of her husband Roy Thomas in 2011. The autopsy report of the deceased revealed the presence of potassium cyanide. The second accused, MS Mathew also confessed that he provided cyanide sourced from third accused and a local goldsmith, Prajith Kumar. Based on confessions and scientific evidence, the accused were arrested,\" said KG Simon, Superintendent of Police, Kozhikode Rural who is heading the investigation team. The bodies of the victims are being exhumed from their graves for further investigation.\n\nWe think this will definitely be a plot of a Malayalam or Bollywood movie pretty soon.\n\n\n\n", "description": "A Kerala housewife has confessed to killing six members of her family over a period of 14 years in a bid to get a hold of the family property.
