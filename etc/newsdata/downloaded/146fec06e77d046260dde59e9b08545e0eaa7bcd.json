About 1.4 million adults made a suicide attempt that year, and 10.6 million reported having serious thoughts about attempting suicide, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\n\nResearch has shown conflicting evidence on psychologists\u2019 suicide risk. But some 18% of respondents to the American Psychological Association\u2019s 2009 Colleague Assistance Survey reported experiencing suicidal ideation while facing professional and personal challenges.\n\nA 2010 APA survey suggested that the chief obstacles to engaging in self-care or using colleague-assistance programs were not having enough time, being concerned about privacy or confidentiality, and denying or minimizing problems.\n\nDespite suicide having shed some of its stigma in recent years, many people are still reluctant to talk openly about how to prevent it. And for someone working in a profession like counseling, psychology or social work, there can be an added assumption that the person knows how to handle their problems, said Wright-Berryman.\n\nStudies have highlighted elevated suicide rates in many other occupations, including physicians, veterinarians and military personnel and veterans. Police officers and firefighters are more likely to die by suicide than in the line of duty, one 2018 white paper found.\n\nA 2015 CDC analysis of more than 22,000 people in 17 states found that suicide rates were highest among men working in construction and extraction; arts, design, entertainment, sports and media; and installation, maintenance and repair. Rates were highest among women working in arts, design, entertainment, sports and media; protective service; and health-care support.\n\nBut while occupation can be an important factor, many other variables might impact a person\u2019s mental health and susceptibility to suicidal behavior, said John Westefeld, a psychologist and professor emeritus at the University of Iowa.\n\n\u201cFor me, a central tenet of all of this is no one is immune to suicidal risk,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen certain groups of people or occupations are focused on, sometimes that point gets lost.\u201d\n\nHere are some steps that institutions, managers and workers can take to reduce suicide risk:\n\nTap into resources. Anyone can call the free, confidential National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting HOME to 741741. But the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention has also compiled several mental-health resources for health-care professionals, and the American Association of Suicidology-affiliated Clinician Survivor Task Force offers support to mental-health professionals with a patient, client or family member who has died by suicide.\n\nDraw support from others in your line of work who can relate to what you\u2019re seeing, feeling and dealing with on a regular basis, said Freedenthal, citing therapists\u2019 private Facebook groups as an example. This kind of connection can be \u201chealing and protective,\u201d she said.\n\nHelp destigmatize helpers getting help. Mental-health challenges must be recognized as any other health challenge, said Freedenthal \u2014 acknowledging \u201cthat it\u2019s not a sign of weakness, that it\u2019s not the person\u2019s fault, and that it\u2019s [ideally] not something that needs to be hidden.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to create a culture and climate where people can be open,\u201d she said. The National Alliance on Mental Illness offers strategies on fighting stigma, including having open conversations, being careful and respectful with language about mental illness, and supporting people in recovery.\n\nPractice self-care. That means setting boundaries around your time, attending to your own needs, having fun, and showing yourself the same compassion you extend to those whom you help, Freedenthal said. Strike a balance in your work, play and relationships, Westefeld said: \u201cThe key there is to have a balanced life: diet and exercise and friends and fun.\u201d\n\nNotice when people are struggling, and reach out. \u201cThere\u2019s a real lack of noticing and there\u2019s a real lack of connectedness that just allows people to fall [into] and stay in despair,\u201d Wright-Berryman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get over this hesitancy that someone\u2019s personal despair is their own business.\u201d It\u2019s not a complicated plan of action, she added: \u201cIt\u2019s noticing and it\u2019s asking.\u201d\n\nIf someone you know is struggling with their mental health and resisting seeking treatment, offer \u201cgenuine, supportive encouragement\u201d instead of giving up on them, Westefeld added. \u201cI\u2019ve found that a lot of people, if they\u2019re gently encouraged over time by friends or family members, will come in,\u201d he said.\n\nIf you\u2019re a manager or decision-maker, use your power for good. Speak openly about the fact that mental-health challenges are very common, Freedenthal said, and that it\u2019s OK to get help or take a mental-health day when needed. If you go to therapy, mention your appointments as casually as you would a dental appointment, she said.\n\nOrganize educational programming, workshops and/or training related to mental health and wellness, which could include a component on suicide prevention, Westefeld said. Institute policies and routinely check in on the mental health of people in helping professions in a standardized way across the board, Wright-Berryman added, rather than singling out people who are struggling. \u201cWhen you use universal approaches like that, there\u2019s a natural destigmatizing effect because everyone has to do it,\u201d she said.\n\nIf you need help, seek it. Regardless of your profession, seek out counseling or therapy if you are feeling depressed or suicidal, Westefeld said. \u201cLet\u2019s give it an opportunity and see how it goes.\u201d", "description": "Here\u2019s what needs to be done to reduce the suicide rate in higher-risk professions, as well as in the general population.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS634_mental_ZG_20191003191021.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
