He'd get a game for any team.\n\n'I'm not always sure he's a player who's consistent and makes the difference all the time.\n\nMoyes admitted Pogba often did not win games himself like Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo\n\n'For the profile he's got, you're hoping he makes the difference. He doesn't always make the difference, but do I think he should stay at Manchester United? Yes, I do.'\n\nPogba has been out of United's last eight games with an ankle issue and could be out for a while longer after being spotted with a walking stick before the game against Liverpool.\n\nMoyes is convinced he will be one of the first names on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's team-sheet when he does return.\n\nBut the former United manager is convinced Pogba is their most important midfielder\n\nHe added: 'I don't think he wins games like Messi does for Barcelona or [Cristiano] Ronaldo does for Juventus, but I still think he's a really talented player. He's got a lot to give.\n\n'Watching him at his best was when he was at Juventus, he played a little bit further forward, he got nearer the box more often.\n\n'If you were picking the Manchester United team, Pogba would be in their midfield at the moment, that's for sure.'", "description": "Real Madrid have been credited with a serious interest in the midfielder, with Zinedine Zidane a huge fan, and Juventus are also thought to be keen on bringing him back to Italy.", "authors": ["Amitai Winehouse For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/15/20038750-0-image-a-240_1571753685586.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
