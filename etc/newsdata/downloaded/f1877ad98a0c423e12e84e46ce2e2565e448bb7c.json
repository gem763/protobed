Authorities said he was arrested on Wednesday morning when he arrived at his workplace in Virginia.\n\nThe reporter with whom he was apparently involved, a woman, published eight articles containing classified defense information between May and July 2018, prosecutors said.\n\nIn April 2018, after Frese accessed one of the intelligence reports, the reporter sent him a private message on Twitter asking if he would be willing to speak with another journalist, who worked at another outlet owned by the same company. Frese replied that he would help if it could help advance the first reporter\u2019s career because he wanted to see her \u201cprogress\u201d.\n\nThe government also intercepted a call in September during which Frese allegedly read classified national defense information to the second journalist, according to court documents.\n\n\u201cFrese betrayed the trust placed in him by the American people a betrayal that risked harming the national security of this country,\u201d said John Demers, assistant attorney general, who leads the justice department\u2019s national security division.\n\nThis marks the sixth federal case involving leaks of classified information in a little over two years. A crackdown on leakers was initiated by the Trump administration in 2017 and led by then attorney general, Jeff Sessions.\n\nThe first case to emerge during the Trump administration involved Reality Winner, a former intelligence analyst who divulged a report about Russian interference in the 2016 election to the Intercept news website. She was sentenced to five years in August 2018.\n\nAnother similar case earlier this year involved former intelligence analyst Daniel Everette Hale, who was also charged in connection with leaking information to the Intercept related to a US drone strike program.\n\nUntil the criminal case against Winner, no one had been charged with leaking classified information since 2013, said Demers, the head of the justice department\u2019s national security division, in a press call on Wednesday to announce the charges against Frese.", "description": "Information Henry Kyle Frese passed to journalist appeared in at least eight news reports, DoJ alleges in indictment", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaa6a4f463951a8ff42f339a3c8348a723032f0e/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f957d41c5e9e220a42855629868c4345", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
