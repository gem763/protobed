Announce Definitive Arrangement Agreement", "language": "en", "text": "Not for distribution to United States newswire services or for release publication, distribution or dissemination directly, or indirectly, in whole or in part, in or into the United States.\n\n\n\nVANCOUVER, British Columbia, Oct. 15, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Broadway Gold Mining Ltd. (\u201cBroadway\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSXV:BRD) (OTC:BDWYF) and Mind Medicine, Inc. (\u201cMindMed\u201d), further to the Company\u2019s press release dated July 26, 2019, are pleased to announce that they have entered into a definitive arrangement agreement (the \u201cArrangement Agreement\u201d) that will, if fully implemented, result in a reverse take-over of Broadway by the current shareholders of MindMed by way of plan of arrangement (the \u201cPlan of Arrangement\u201d) under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (the \u201cArrangement\u201d). The Arrangement Agreement will be available on www.SEDAR.com under Broadway\u2019s profile.\n\nDescription of the Arrangement\n\nSubject to the approval of the Supreme Court of British Columbia (the \u201cCourt\u201d), as well as all required TSX Venture Exchange (\u201cTSXVE\u201d), regulatory and other approvals and the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions contained in the Arrangement Agreement (a summary of which is set out below), the Arrangement will occur via a \u201creverse takeover\u201d (the \u201cRTO\u201d) of Broadway by MindMed under the policies of the TSXVE. Pursuant to the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, Broadway Delaware Subco Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Broadway incorporated for the purpose under the laws of Delaware (\u201cDelaware Subco\u201d) will merge with MindMed. In accordance with the Arrangement and the articles of MindMed, all outstanding Class B common shares (\u201cClass B Shares\u201d), Class C common shares (\u201cClass C Shares\u201d) and Class D common shares (\u201cClass D Shares\u201d) of MindMed will be exchanged for Class A common shares (\u201cClass A Shares\u201d), immediately following which all Class A Shares of MindMed will be exchanged, on a one-for-one basis (the \u201cExchange Ratio\u201d), for securities of Broadway on a Consolidated (as defined below) basis (Broadway following the completion of the Arrangement herein referred to as the \u201cResulting Issuer\u201d). Any outstanding convertible securities of MindMed, including any convertible securities issued in connection with the MindMed Financing (as defined below), will be exchanged for convertible securities of the Resulting Issuer on the basis of the Exchange Ratio.\n\nAs part of the Arrangement and subject to the receipt of all required approvals, Broadway will consolidate its outstanding shares, warrants and options on an eight (8) old common shares for one (1) new common share basis (the \u201cConsolidation\u201d) and change its name to \u201cMind Medicine (MindMed), Inc.\u201d (or such other name as MindMed may determine) (the \u201cName Change\u201d). It will also amend its capital structure (the \u201cCapital Structure Amendment\u201d) by creating a new class of multiple voting shares that will each carry 100 votes per share (the \u201cMultiple Voting Shares\u201d), and change the name of its common shares to \u201csubordinate voting shares\u201d (with all other terms of the common shares remaining unchanged). The Multiple Voting Shares will be issued to certain U.S. resident holders of MindMed shares in connection with the Arrangement. Prior to the Consolidation, there are currently outstanding an aggregate of 49,860,204 common shares in the capital of Broadway (each, a \u201cBroadway Common Share\u201d) as well as approximately 3,100,500 share purchase warrants exercisable at CDN$0.15 per share (the \u201cBroadway Warrants\u201d) and 3,840,000 stock options exercisable at prices ranging from CDN$0.05 to CDN$0.43 (the \u201cBroadway Options\u201d). All of these securities will be subject to the Consolidation. MindMed currently has a total of 151,993,671 voting and non-voting shares in the capital of MindMed (each, a \u201cMindMed Share\u201d), prior to the completion of the MindMed Financing (as defined below). All securities issued to MindMed shareholders pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement will be on a post-Consolidated basis. It is anticipated that in the aggregate the (former) MindMed shareholders will hold approximately 96.06% of the post-Consolidated outstanding voting securities of the Resulting Issuer on an undiluted basis, prior to the completion of the MindMed Financing.\n\nThe Plan of Arrangement also includes the transfer of all of Broadway\u2019s right, title and interest, and all associated liabilities, in the Broadway and Madison mine (the \u201cSpin-Out Transaction\u201d), which comprises 450 acres of land, a 192 acre ranch, buildings, mine equipment and fixtures, 6 patented, 35 unpatented mineral claims, and mineral rights to a four-square-mile property, in the Butte-Anaconda region of Montana (the \u201cMadison Project\u201d) to a wholly-owned B.C. subsidiary of Broadway, Madison Metals Inc. (\u201cSpinCo\u201d). SpinCo was incorporated for the purpose of acquiring the Madison Project and has not carried on nor will carry on any other business.\n\nThe Madison Project is currently held by Broadway Gold Corp. (\u201cBroadway Montana\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Spin-Out Transaction will consist of the transfer of all of the shares of Broadway Montana and any related assets and liabilities in connection with the Madison Project to SpinCo (the \u201cTransferred Assets\u201d). SpinCo will also assume all liabilities associated with Broadway\u2019s mineral exploration and development business as conducted prior to the completion of the Arrangement. Pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement, SpinCo will issue 49,860,204 common shares to Broadway as consideration for the Transferred Assets (the \u201cSpinCo Consideration Shares\u201d), which SpinCo Consideration Shares will be distributed to the holders of record of the Company\u2019s shares immediately before completion of the RTO on a pro-rata basis (other than to shareholders who dissent in accordance with the provisions of the Arrangement). Broadway shareholders will be entitled to receive one SpinCo Consideration Share for every common share of Broadway on a pre-Consolidation basis held by such shareholder. As a result, in connection with the Arrangement (and assuming it is completed, for which there can be no assurances), each Broadway shareholder will hold shares of SpinCo as well as their post-Consolidation shares of the Resulting Issuer. The SpinCo Consideration Shares will not be listed or posted for trading on any stock exchange, therefore there will be reduced liquidity for SpinCo shares. There is no guarantee or assurance that securities of SpinCo will ever be listed for trading on any stock exchange.\n\nExploration is being conducted on the Madison Project by Kennecott Exploration Limited under an Earn-In with Option to Joint Venture Agreement (the \u201cEarn-in Agreement\u201d) announced in Broadway\u2019s news release dated April 30, 2019. It is the intention of management that SpinCo will continue operations in Montana under the Earn-in Agreement with Kennecott and will review projects of merit for additional acquisitions to grow the company. Shareholders should note that Broadway did not complete the purchase of the four exploration prospecting licenses in Namibia referred to in its June 3, 2019 news release and does not intend to proceed with that transaction.\n\nAs the Arrangement (including the Consolidation, the Name Change and the Authorized Capital Amendment) requires the approval of the shareholders of the Company by not less than two-thirds of the votes cast at a meeting of such shareholders. Broadway will call an annual and special meeting (the \u201cMeeting\u201d) of shareholders in compliance with an interim order of the Court, which Broadway will seek in accordance with the terms of the Arrangement Agreement. In connection with the Meeting, Broadway will mail an information circular (the \u201cCircular\u201d) to its shareholders describing the Arrangement, MindMed, Delaware Subco, the Spinout, SpinCo and all related matters and other information prescribed under applicable securities laws and TSXVE policies. The effective date of the Arrangement is currently planned for late in the fourth quarter of 2019 or early in the first quarter of 2020. There will be no changes in a shareholder\u2019s holdings in Broadway (other than the Consolidation) as a result of the Arrangement.\n\nThe Arrangement is subject to TSXVE, regulatory and Court approvals in addition to shareholder approval. Full details of the Arrangement will be included in the Circular to be sent to Broadway shareholders in connection with the Meeting. Investors are cautioned that, except as disclosed in the Circular, any information released or received with respect to the Arrangement, the Spin-Out Transaction, the MindMed Offering, and/or other associated transactions may not be accurate or complete and should not be relied upon. Trading in the securities of Broadway should be considered highly speculative.\n\nThe MindMed Financing\n\nMindMed has issued a total of 90,000,000 Class A and Class B shares; the Class A Shares were issued to Savant Addiction Medicine LLC (\u201cSavant\u201d), a Delaware limited liability company, as consideration for the transfer by Savant to MindMed of the 18-MC Program (as described below), and the Class B Shares were issued to certain founders of MindMed. In addition, MindMed has completed a non-brokered offering of 60,992,630 non-voting Class C Shares and Class D Shares at a price of US$0.10 per share for gross proceeds of US$6,099,263 (the \u201cNon-Brokered Offering\u201d). MindMed also settled all outstanding principal and interest on a loan of US$100,000 through the issuance of 1,021,041 Class C Shares.\n\nPrior to the effectiveness of the Arrangement, MindMed intends to complete a brokered offering of securities (the \u201cMindMed Financing\u201d). Details of the MindMed Financing will be announced as they become available. There can be no assurances that the MindMed Financing will proceed, be completed or will raise any particular minimum proceeds if commenced.\n\nUpon completion of the proposed Arrangement, and without taking into account the completion of the MindMed Financing, there will be 158,226,197 undiluted post-Consolidation common shares of the Resulting Issuer issued and outstanding, of which it is expected that the current shareholders of Broadway will hold approximately 3.94% on an undiluted basis, purchasers in the Non-Brokered Offering and including the settlement of the loan mentioned above will hold approximately 39.18% and the Class A Shareholders and Class B Shareholders of MindMed will together hold approximately 56.88% (with all such percentages provided on a non-diluted basis).\n\nManagement of the Resulting Issuer\n\nInsiders, Officers and Board of Directors of the Resulting Issuer\n\nThe board of directors of the Resulting Issuer shall be reconstituted to consist of nominees of MindMed and all existing officers of Broadway shall resign and be replaced by nominees of MindMed, as further described below. It is expected that upon completion of the Arrangement the Resulting Issuer will have a board of seven individuals of which six have been identified as of the date of this press release. Discussions are ongoing with other potential directors and the additional nominees will be announced in a subsequent news release as well as in the Circular.
