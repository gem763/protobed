Photo: Sara Krulwich\n\nAlix Kates Shulman had been a radical feminist in New York City for several years when her novel, Memoirs of an Ex-Prom Queen, hit shelves in 1972. At that point, the women\u2019s movement had spread far beyond the coastal cities and onto the covers of mainstream magazines, not to mention the Senate floor. Without mentioning politics at all, Prom Queen laid out a case for revolution, following Sasha, one white, Midwestern girl in the 1950s, from her repressive girlhood to the lonely, mind-numbing churn of early motherhood. It describes what were then hush-hush experiences in unflinching detail: sexual double standards, spousal rape, workplace harassment, illegal abortion, and the particular middle-class female experience of falling in love with ideas in college, only to realize your ambition was always meant to be funneled into husband-hunting. Despite sniffy reviews \u2014 a New York Times writer called it \u201can angry little book\u201d \u2014 Prom Queen became an instant best seller and a feminist classic.\n\nI picked up the novel as a young teenager, in the thick of the \u201cYou go, girl!\u201d late-\u201990s. It was the first time I truly realized that girls hadn\u2019t always been told that they could do or be anything, or that, for a certain type of woman, her youth and beauty were time-bombs ticking down to her eventual fate as a domestic matron. Rereading Memoirs of an Ex-Prom Queen, which is being reissued this week by Picador, it took on a whole new resonance now that we\u2019re in the middle of another wave of gender consciousness and activism. I spoke to Shulman in her Chelsea loft over wine and Milano cookies about what\u2019s changed in the nearly five decades since readers fiercely identified with Sasha, and what hasn\u2019t.\n\nWhen I first read this book in the \u201990s, I remember thinking, \u201cThank God I don\u2019t have to deal with any of this, things are so much better now!\u201d But this time around, all I could see were the similarities to the present day. For instance, the main character Sasha\u2019s constant sexual tug-of-war in the backseat of her high-school boyfriend Joey\u2019s car. They could have had a wonderful romance, and yet it was ruined because he was told he needed to go as far as possible, and she was told she needed to guard her virginity at all costs. It sort of reminded me of the Aziz Ansari incident: men as pursuers, women as gatekeepers.\n\nI wanted so much to depict what bad high-school sex was like, when you have that conflict where you\u2019re each expected to do different things. Like the fact that he promises to get it over with in the backseat as quickly as possible. He didn\u2019t even remove her underpants. How are you possibly going to have good sex when you have to do it really fast and you can\u2019t even get naked?\n\nI also had this moment of like, \u201cPoor Sasha but also poor Joey.\u201d Men need liberation, too!\n\nI definitely didn\u2019t want to make the men the villains. That was a very conscious choice. I wanted them all to be caught in a trap, to be confused and mystified, too. The only true villain in the book is Jan, the meat chef [who sexually harasses Sasha at her waitressing job and makes her work life hell until she agrees to go on a date with him].\n\nYeah, but the meat chef was probably a Joey back in the day, struggling with women in the backseat, and then he metastasized into this monster because no one ever told him, \u201cThat\u2019s not how you\u2019re supposed to act.\u201d\n\nYes, and Jan did stop pushing Sasha to have sex when she started crying. Sasha pulls out a lot of techniques in order to avoid the sex in the car after their date.\n\nYou\u2019ve said that Sasha\u2019s life is heavily based on your life in the suburbs of Ohio. Were you a prom queen, too?\n\nNo, although I was a popular girl. My inspiration for the novel came when I was marching around in the 1968 Miss America pageant protest. The proms all over the country were essentially like beauty pageants. They were these contests where women were judged mainly for their looks. I remember the \u201cslam books\u201d from junior high, where people would pass around notebooks and write: Who had the prettiest legs, who has the best nose, who has the best bosom? Body objectification is so strange! It\u2019s like, who has the best kidney?\n\nBut at a certain point, [youthful beauty] is over. I was lucky, because at about the time it would have been over for me, I became a writer, which is much more interesting to me than trying to be attractive.\n\nShulman marching in the Miss America protest.

I had become a feminist at my first meeting in the East Village in December 1967, when I heard about New York Radical Women on the radio. So by 1968 I was going to meetings all the time. I\u2019d had a job I loved, which was as an encyclopedia editor. But I had to leave when I got pregnant, as soon as I started to show. There was no such thing as maternity leave. So I was home, and I had to do something, because my career, my worldly life was over. So I started writing.\n\nDid you have any sense before Prom Queen came out that the book was going to hit a nerve?\n\nI had no idea. I thought I was writing it for the ten people in my women\u2019s group. But by the time it came out in \u201972, the feminist movement had taken off and people were hungry to have their own experience viewed through a feminist lens. There were great nonfiction books explaining our feminist take \u2014 Shulamith Firestone, Kate Millett \u2014 but fiction is different. It\u2019s emotional. Prom Queen was the hottest galley around, and the heads of the publishing houses, who were all men, had no idea why. They didn\u2019t get it at all. And not everyone understood that the book was supposed to be funny.\n\nYeah, it\u2019s darkly comic. There\u2019s that moment in the book when Sasha tries to leave her first husband and he responds by forcing himself on her, and she just starts laughing. Like, \u201cThis is horrible, but this is also so absurd. I pity you.\u201d\n\n\ufeffSardonic humor is a response to the feeling that there\u2019s nothing to be done. This is the way it is, you can\u2019t do anything, so you might as well laugh. The alternative is rage and of course there\u2019s lots of rage in Prom Queen, too, but that isn\u2019t going to get it done, either, absent a feminist movement. And it\u2019s definitely a pre-movement book.\n\nRight, you see all the reasons why you need feminism, but you don\u2019t see feminism itself.\n\nExactly. The book ends around the time the feminist movement begins [in the mid-\u201960s]. It\u2019s a consciousness-raising novel. There\u2019s so much of #MeToo in this novel, so much description of unacceptable behavior toward women even from quote-unquote innocent men \u2014 men who don\u2019t know they\u2019re not supposed to do that.\n\nAnd Sasha didn\u2019t really have the opportunity to say \u201cme too,\u201d because she wasn\u2019t close to any women around her. She\u2019s sort of dealing with this all on her own.\n\nWell that, of course, was the major thing that changed in our lives the minute we became feminists. \u201cSisterhood is powerful\u201d sounds sentimental now, but it was a very revolutionary idea. Though Sasha does have [her college friend] Roxanne.\n\nRight, she\u2019s the one who, when Sasha complains about her bad marriage, tells her, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t have to be your fate. You can just leave. You can get a job.\u201d Is Roxanne the stealth feminist character of the book?\n\n\ufeffThere are things she does that look like feminism. She puts raw eggs instead of hard-boiled eggs in her husband\u2019s lunchbox, and she does a lot of other little subversive things to protest her societal position. But again, unless there is a movement, you can\u2019t really be a liberated woman. You can\u2019t do it alone.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about some of Sasha\u2019s good sex. The first time she really seems to enjoy a sexual experience is with her married college professor. Do you see that relationship differently now that professors sleeping with their students is more widely seen as an abuse of power and a creepy thing to do?\n\nI thought he was a creep back when I was writing it, too. I remember writing about him looking at her and crushing a pencil between his teeth \u2014 you can see him as the predator in that scene. And even though she asks him, \u201cAre you seducible?\u201d I didn\u2019t think that at that time such a man would possibly say no. Nowadays, I think he should have said no. What I\u2019m judging more is his behavior, not hers.\n\nOf course, why wouldn\u2019t she have a crush on him?\n\nOh yeah, he knew everything, and she knew nothing. And don\u2019t we all have crushes on our professors? She is finally getting some good sex, and she\u2019s trying to make it on her terms, but of course it\u2019s a given \u2014 as it is for every single predicament she finds herself in \u2014 that she can\u2019t really win.\n\nThe through line of the book is really these double binds that women were constantly put in, pre-feminism. The broader sense is always: Sasha can\u2019t win.\n\nOh, Nona. That\u2019s how we all felt, all the time!\n\nStay in touch.
