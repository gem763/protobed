I hope to learn as much as possible from those players,\" he said.\n\nCapetonian Verreynne is a huge talent and finished as the second-highest run-scorer in this year's One-Day Cup behind Markram.\n\nHe scored 453 runs in 9 innings at an average of 64.71 in that competition and it was that form that saw him included in the SA 'A' side.\n\nVerreynne recently returned from his first-ever trip to India as part of the SA 'A' squad that played five ODIs on the sub-continent.\n\nHe is now looking forward to the Mzansi Super League, the vibe in Paarl and the ultimate prize.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to joining a team that did quite well in last season's campaign. This year I want to help the team to win the title. The support in Paarl is always amazing, I'm really looking forward to that,\" he said.\n\nThe Mzansi Super League (MSL 2.0) is taking place from November 8 to December 16.\n\n- Cricket South Africa", "description": "Newly drafted Kyle Verreynne says he wants to help the Paarl Rocks win the 2019 Mzansi Super League title.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9331/a560995bbe3f4f029b20d6b702d36399.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
