And more than half a million children have not had the vaccination since 2010. Health experts fear parents are being turned against inoculation by fake science put on social media by the \u2018anti-vaxx\u2019 lobby.\n\nBusy modern lifestyles and public complacency have also been cited for the crisis, with many adults forgetting that measles is a killer.\n\nTwo weeks ago a Government report revealed uptake had fallen for all ten childhood jabs, including measles, polio, meningitis and whooping cough.\n\nDebbie Roscoe, 57, and her daughter Ellie, 24. Ellie almost died from measles last year because Debbie chose for Ellie not to have the full MMR jabs as a child.\n\nBut health officials are particularly worried about MMR vaccination rates, which have slipped to their lowest level in five years. Two months ago the World Health Organisation declared that the UK was no longer \u2018measles free\u2019, with poor vaccination rates blamed for the virus\u2019s return.\n\nThe Mail\u2019s campaign is calling for the NHS to introduce an alert system \u2013 text messages or letters \u2013 to remind busy parents of immunisation appointments.\n\nThis newspaper urgently wants to see the fall in uptake reversed, to such an extent that we hit 95 per cent coverage across all ten jabs.\n\nThis vital 95 per cent figure is the World Health Organisation\u2019s target because it ensures \u2018herd immunity\u2019 from a virus.\n\nWith so many of the population protected, the virus is unable to spread and subsequently dies out. The UK would regain its \u2018measles free\u2019 status if vaccination rates improved sharply.\n\nDr Mary Ramsay of Public Health England, the Government agency which oversees vaccinations, said: \u2018These diseases kill. Every child getting the right vaccine at the right time \u2013 that\u2019s what we need to achieve. We\u2019re delighted to have the Mail on board, getting the message to parents and supporting the changes we\u2019re making.\u2019\n\nLiam Sollis of the charity Unicef UK said: \u2018A serious measles outbreak is a ticking time-bomb. It\u2019s great to see the Mail\u2019s campaign to promote vaccination.\u2019\n\nMeasles cases have soared, with the disease striking 991 children last year \u2013 treble the 2017 total. Official figures analysed by the Mail reveal that across Europe only France has more children without protection against the disease\n\nWhat every parent MUST know WHAT IS THE MMR VACCINE? The MMR jab is a combined vaccination that protects against measles, mumps and rubella, all extremely serious diseases. Before the introduction of measles vaccines in the 1960s there were, on average, 85 deaths from the disease each year in England and Wales. MMR was introduced in 1988 and has proved so effective that between 1999 and 2019 there were only four deaths. Mumps can cause deafness, brain swelling and meningitis. Rubella generally presents as a mild rash in children, but if it\u2019s caught early in pregnancy, a woman has a 90 per cent chance of passing the virus on to her foetus which can cause severe birth defects or death. The MMR jab is given as part of a NHS childhood vaccination schedule that starts from the age of eight weeks and goes up to 14 years. The age at which children have each vaccination varies, but as well as MMR, the schedule includes rotavirus (a common cause of diarrhoea and sickness), whooping cough, meningitis B, diphtheria, tetanus, polio and HPV (human papillomavirus, linked to cervical cancer). MMR is given in two stages, first at one year old and then a booster jab at three years and four months. The vaccine contains weakened versions of measles, mumps and rubella viruses, along with water and preservatives for better storage and to hold the components together. Two brands of MMR are available on the NHS \u2013 Priorix and MMRVaxPro (which contains porcine gelatine). \u2018Once you\u2019ve been vaccinated, your immune system develops memory antibody cells,\u2019 explains Dr Nicky Longley, a consultant in travel medicine and infectious diseases at University College London. \u2018Next time it comes into contact with the infection, those memory cells are ready to divide and produce an army of immune cells fighting the infection and preventing it from invading your body and making you ill.\u2019 HOW EFFECTIVE IS MMR? A single dose protects 93 per cent of people against measles, 78 per cent against mumps and 97 per cent against rubella. The recommended two doses of the vaccine increase the rate of protection to 97 per cent for measles and rubella, and 88 per cent for mumps. You may still catch one of these diseases after being vaccinated but it\u2019s very unlikely and, if you do, it will be a much milder version. Protection against measles and rubella lasts for many decades; protection from mumps gradually declines (lasting on average 27 years) so many adults may not be immune. WHY DO EXPERTS SAY IT\u2019S SAFE? Anti-vaxxers claim the triple vaccine is too much of an assault on a young child\u2019s immune system. But, according to Dr Doug Brown, chief executive of the British Society for Immunology, it works because if the vaccines were spread out, children would be vulnerable for longer. \u2018A child\u2019s immune system is designed to fight off lots of germs every day,\u2019 he says. \u2018The amount of challenge that it faces from the combined vaccine is very small in comparison and puts no extra strain on it.\u2019 Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, says there is no evidence the triple vaccine is too much for a child\u2019s body. \u2018You cannot overload your immune system,\u2019 he adds. \u2018And the MMR involves just two visits (rather than six if each vaccine was given separately) \u2013 fewer needles for your children.\u2019 WHY DOES IT MATTER IF MMR IMMUNISATION RATES DROP? Infectious diseases are easily passed from person to person and entire communities can rapidly become infected. If a high enough proportion of a community is protected by immunisation, it stops the disease circulating because the number of people who can be infected is so small. This is called herd immunity. Herd immunity is important because it protects people who cannot be vaccinated - some of the most vulnerable people in society, including children who are too young to be vaccinated and people with a compromised immune systems. By vaccinating your child, you\u2019re not only protecting them but also protecting the most vulnerable in your community. The World Health Organisation advises that 95 per cent of children need to be receive the MMR jab in order to stop the diseases spreading. \u2018This is particularly important for measles as it is so contagious,\u2019 says Dr Brown. \u2018In an unvaccinated community, each person with measles would on average pass the disease on to 12 others. That\u2019s why ensuring a high vaccination rate is critical to stopping the spread of this disease.\u2019 HOW MANY CHILDREN HAVE IT? The uptake of MMR in the UK is well below the recommended level of 95 per cent to achieve herd immunity \u2013 with an uptake of 90.3 per cent in 2018/19. This is lower than in many other European countries. Recent NHS vaccine statistics for England showed that last year only 86.4 per cent of children receive two doses of MMR by the age of five. In the past few years, measles and mumps rates have risen rapidly in the UK - and all over the world. The number of cases across Europe soared from about 5,000 in 2016 to 84,000 in 2018. The US is suffering its worst measles outbreak for 27 years. The WHO lists vaccine hesitancy \u2013 delaying or avoiding jabs - as one of its top ten global health threats. WHY ARE SOME PARENTS SHUNNING THE VACCINE? a major issue is not being able to get a GP appointment at a convenient time, says Dr Jonathan Kennedy, a global public health expert at Queen Mary University of London. \u2018In a recent survey by the Royal Society of Public Health, the \u201ctiming, availability and location of appointments were identified as barriers to vaccination\u201d,\u2019 he says. \u2018There\u2019s also a problem with demand for vaccines as a result of concerns about safety,\u2019 he adds. \u2018In the same survey, one in five parents thought MMR was likely to cause unwanted side-effects and one in ten decided not to vaccinate their child with MMR, the majority due to concerns over safety.\u2019 MMR can potentially cause redness, pain or swelling at the site of the injection, a fever (about one in 15 children) or a short-lived rash (around one in ten). Extremely uncommon side-effects include severe allergic reactions and seizures. WHAT ABOUT MMR AND AUTISM? Some parents believe the triple jab can cause autism. The root of this lies in a paper published in 1998 in the Lancet medical journal by Dr Andrew Wakefield. The British gastroenterologist had looked at 12 children with autism, identifying eight whose parents said their children\u2019s behavioural symptoms had developed within two weeks following the MMR jab. The paper had a major impact but Wakefield was struck off in 2010 by the General Medical Council for acting dishonestly and irresponsibly in the way he conducted his research. His paper was retracted by the Lancet. HOW DO WE KNOW THE MMR DOESN\u2019T CAUSE AUTISM? AT least ten major studies have shown there is no link between the MMR and autism. The most recent, published earlier this year, involved over 650,000 children and found not only no evidence of a connection, but that this was true even among children considered at heightened risk of autism. SHOULD MMR BE MANDATORY? Health Secretary Matt Hancock says there is a \u2018very strong argument\u2019 for making vaccinations for children compulsory. According to Dr Kennedy, the UK would not be the first country to consider this. \u2018In 2017, the Italian government announced that unvaccinated children would not be allowed to attend school,\u2019 he says. \u2018The following year, France increased the number of mandatory vaccines from three to 11. \u2018In the US, where parents can claim exemptions from compulsory vaccination for medical, philosophical or religious reasons, some states have moved to limit or eliminate non-medical exemptions. \u2018Data suggests that mandatory vaccination legislation is effective,\u2019 he adds, pointing to Italy and France, where vaccine uptake has increased uptake. But Dr Brown says compulsory vaccination is a blunt tool and there is no evidence that it would increase immunisation rates. \u2018There are concerns that it could increase current health inequalities and alienate parents with questions on vaccination,\u2019 he warns. WHAT IF MY CHILD MISSED OUT ON THE MMR JAB? It\u2019s never too late to catch up. Older children and adults who missed out can get the jab free on the NHS.\n\nProfessor Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said: \u2018It\u2019s vital parents understand that choosing not to vaccinate their child isn\u2019t just putting their own child at risk, but other children too.\n\n\u2018There is a lot of dangerous anti-vaccination propaganda out there, particularly on social media, that can be incredibly confusing.\n\n\u2018We hope the Mail\u2019s campaign will help to cut through this confusion and allow people make positive, informed and educated choices.\u2019\n\nA health scare over MMR was triggered 20 years ago when a study by former NHS consultant Andrew Wakefield linked the jab to autism.\n\nLike many news organisations, the Daily Mail gave coverage to his findings, which had been published in a highly respected medical journal, the Lancet. However, Wakefield\u2019s research was later found to be \u2018utterly false\u2019 and he was struck off the medical register.\n\nMeasles is highly infectious and causes a temperature, cold-like symptoms, greyish spots and sore, red eyes. Usually it clears up after ten days but sometimes it leads to swelling of the brain, which can cause deafness or death.\n\nFigures provided by Unicef and analysed by the Mail show that 61,788 one-year-olds missed the first MMR vaccine in the UK in 2018. This was the second highest number in Europe after France, where 72,703 babies were not given the jab last year. Turkey was third with a figure of 52,058 and the Ukraine fourth at 37,660. The Mail compared data for 43 European nations without adjusting for population size.\n\nUnlike many other countries, the UK\u2019s vaccination rates are falling so the number of unprotected children is going up every year. This is despite numerous credible studies showing there is absolutely no link between MMR and autism, nor any other illnesses.\n\nOne of the most definitive reviews was published in March and involved 650,000 children who had been tracked for ten years. The authors from the Statens Serum Institute in Copenhagen concluded there was \u2018no support\u2019 for the link.\n\nThe figures from Unicef show that around 585,000 children in the UK missed their first MMR jab between 2010 and 2018. Just 92 per cent of one-year-olds were given it, three percentage points short of the WHO\u2019s target.\n\nThe most recent figures for England alone are even worse and, in 2018/19, only 90 per cent of children received the first MMR jab. The NHS recommends they are given a second dose when they are three.\n\nLast week Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed he was taking legal advice on introducing compulsory vaccinations for school children. But public health experts fear this will have adverse consequences with parents feeling forced to take children out of school.\n\nYesterday doctors called for vaccinations to be offered in supermarkets and nurseries to tackle the decline in uptake.\n\nOne reason the number of unvaccinated children in the UK is higher than some European nations is that our population is larger.\n\nHOUNDED BY \u2018ANTI VAXXER\u2019 TROLLS... OVER MY BABY'S MEASLES AGONY\n\nWeeks before her jab was due, Alba was seriously infected. But when her mother posted this picture as a warning to other parents, she was sickeningly abused\n\nJilly Moss will never forget the night she thought that her baby daughter Alba was going to die. \u2018It was the worst time of my life and I was absolutely terrified,\u2019 she says.\n\nIt was in April this year when little Alba, who was about to turn one, contracted measles.\n\nToo young to be vaccinated, the youngster was hospitalised after her temperature soared to 42c. Her eyes were swollen shut and doctors were worried that Alba could lose her sight. She couldn\u2019t eat or drink and had so much trouble breathing that she had to be put on oxygen.\n\nIt was a terrifying time for Jilly, 35, a full-time mother and husband Richard, 35, a product manager who live in Surbiton, Surrey, with their daughter, now 18 months. The couple have no idea where she caught the virus, but Alba first showed signs of the illness in the days leading up to her birthday on April 1.\n\nJilly Moss will never forget the night she thought that her baby daughter Alba (pictured) was going to die. \u2018It was the worst time of my life and I was absolutely terrified,\u2019 she says. It was in April this year when little Alba, who was about to turn one, contracted measles\n\n\u2018She had no appetite, a high temperature, puffy eyes and a very delicate rash on the back of her head and I was back and forth to the doctors who kept saying it was viral and nothing to worry about,\u2019 says Jilly.\n\n\u2018She\u2019d been a healthy baby before that but about four days after her birthday, I was getting increasingly concerned. I took a picture of her rash and sent it to my granny, a 93-year-old former teacher, and she rang me straight away and said: \u201cShe\u2019s got measles.\u201d But when I took Alba back to the GP, the doctor said I shouldn\u2019t worry.\u2019\n\nHowever the next day, the couple took their little girl to Chelsea And Westminster hospital. \u2018She hadn\u2019t eaten or drunk anything and we were getting really concerned,\u2019 says Jilly. \u2018That\u2019s where they diagnosed measles. At first, I was relieved. I thought it could have been meningitis and when I heard the word \u201cmeasles\u201d, I assumed it was the sort of illness children recovered from all the time. But the doctor said: \u201cI don\u2019t think you realise, it\u2019s incredibly serious.\u201d \u2019\n\nToo young to be vaccinated, the youngster was hospitalised after her temperature soared to 42c. Her eyes were swollen shut and doctors were worried that Alba could lose her sight. She couldn\u2019t eat or drink and had so much trouble breathing that she had to be put on oxygen\n\nThe next eight days saw Alba undergo several tests, including a spinal tap and an MRI scan, and she given strong doses of antibiotics. \u2018Her little body was shutting down and the doctors wanted to make sure there were no secondary infections,\u2019 Jilly recalls. \u2018The doctors and nurses were incredible. They kept us calm and it was only afterwards, when we were discharged, that they admitted how very worried they\u2019d been.\u2019\n\nIn fact, the doctors urged the couple to share pictures of their daughter on social media to encourage people to be vaccinated. \u2018They said: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more and more cases of measles, so it would be good if you could share these images online and educate them about what could happen.\u201d And I was more than happy to do that.\u2019\n\nBut when Jilly shared a post on Facebook showing pictures of Alba covered in measles and encouraging people to vaccinate their children, she was shocked by the backlash. \u2018I\u2019ve never witnessed hatred like it from mothers to another mother,\u2019 she says. \u2018They were blaming me, saying that it was my fault she\u2019d got measles because I hadn\u2019t kept her at home all year.\n\n\u2018They said I had been feeding Alba poison because I\u2019d been formula-feeding her \u2014 in fact, I\u2019d been breastfeeding \u2014 and at one point, they suggested that none of it was real. They said Richard worked for a big pharmaceutical company, that I was an actress and Alba was a doll.\n\n\u2018They\u2019d send me information containing absolute rubbish \u2014 saying there were \u201cdead baby cells\u201d in the MMR vaccine and things like that. What boggles my brain is that most of the anti-vaxxers are from my generation, people who have been vaccinated themselves, so they are protected but won\u2019t protect their own children. They believe there\u2019s a link with autism, even though the doctor who started the MMR scare [Andrew Wakefield] has been totally discredited and lost his licence.\u2019\n\nAlba is still undergoing tests to see if the illness has affected her in the long term.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s not out of the woods and only a couple of weeks ago had to be rushed into hospital with a convulsion which may or may not be related,\u2019 says Jilly.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s been having vacant episodes and there was talk about possible epilepsy. We\u2019re waiting to see a neurologist to see if any damage has been done but we just don\u2019t know.\n\n\u2018I will never understand people who won\u2019t trust doctors when it comes to vaccines. If their child wasn\u2019t breathing, they\u2019d take it straight to the hospital to be treated by doctors, not stick it in a darkened room and give it vitamins.\n\n\u2018If anyone is concerned or worried about what\u2019s in the vaccine or about side-effects, they should speak to their doctor and get advice. The last thing they should do is go on the internet and read what the anti-vaxxers are saying.\n\n\u2018I wouldn\u2019t want to wish what we\u2019ve been through on anyone.\u2019", "description": "This newspaper urgently wants to see the fall in uptake reversed, to such an extent that we hit 95 per cent coverage across all ten jabs.", "authors": ["Sophie Borland", "Ben Spencer", "Eleanor Hayward For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/22/19513332-0-image-a-57_1570657289087.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
