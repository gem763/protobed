The mother of two returned to horseback riding just three weeks after Carolina's birth.\n\nThe second snapshot Eric shared shows Carolina lying on her back on the same pink blanket while looking up at him as he takes her picture.\n\nFamily: Eric and his wife Lara welcomed their baby girl in August, less than a month before their son Luke celebrated his second birthday\n\nAll smiles: Lara, 37, enjoyed some cuddle time with Carolina last week\n\nToo cute: Luke, two, spent some quality time with his sister in her crib earlier this month\n\nLara, 37, enjoyed some cuddle time with their baby girl last Wednesday, the day after she and Eric attended the Rescue Dogs Rock gala she co-chaired with Georgina Bloomberg.\n\nThe proud mom shared a photo of herself wearing a fluffy white bathrobe while cradling her smiling daughter.\n\n'Morning smiles are the best!' she captioned the snapshot.\n\nLara and Eric welcomed their baby girl in August, less than a month before their son Luke celebrated his second birthday.\n\nDay of work: While Eric and Lara are spending some quality time with their family's newest addition in New York City, his sister Ivanka is keeping busy at the White House\n\nFocused: The first daughter attended a meeting of the president's Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (PITF) on Tuesday\n\nSidekick: The first daughter sat next to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at the meeting\n\nThe little boy has quickly adjusted to being a big brother, and earlier this month Lara posted a photo of him standing in his baby sister's crib.\n\nThe picture was undoubtedly precious, but some were worried that Luke might have injured Carolina if he accidentally stepped or fell on her.\n\nIt seems as though Lara anticipated the concern when she added a disclaimer to her caption.\n\n'These two are getting into trouble together already #CueHeartExplosion #Siblings #BFFs (and for anyone worried about the baby, there are several adults ready to jump in at any point. Thanks for your concern),' she wrote.\n\nStyle: Ivanka donned a black dress with white polka dots and gold buttons\n\nSaying goodbye: Ivanka gave Pompeo a kiss on the cheek after the meeting was over\n\nOn the go: Ivanka also shared a laugh with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar while on her way out\n\nWhile Eric and Lara are spending some quality time with their family's newest addition in New York City, his sister Ivanka is keeping busy at the White House.\n\nThe first daughter attended a meeting of the president's Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (PITF) in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on Tuesday.\n\nIvanka donned a black dress with white polka dots and gold buttons going down the front.
