In 1989, this was the basis of a major victory for a woman named Ann Hopkins, who sued her employer, the accounting firm then known as Price Waterhouse, for telling her she needed to wear make-up and otherwise play up her feminine charms to get promoted to partner. Over the last 30 years, LGBTQ advocates have argued that sex stereotyping is also what drives employers to discriminate against people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender, believing LGBTQ people fail to meet society\u2019s standards for how men and women should act.\n\nRead: America moved on from its gay-rights moment\u2014and left a legal mess behind\n\nThis issue was essentially shoved onto the Supreme Court\u2019s doorstep. Lawsuits involving alleged LGBTQ discrimination have proliferated in recent years, and the circuit courts of appeal don\u2019t agree on how to interpret the meaning of sex and the scope of Title VII. Many Supreme Court watchers have predicted that the justices will vote predictably along conservative-liberal lines, finding against the LGBTQ petitioners and respondents. Conservative legal advocates have advanced a range of arguments for why LGBTQ advocates should lose these cases: Some do not think Title VII actually says anything about LGBTQ identity. Others believe sexuality and gender identity should not be specially protected categories in civil-rights law, because that would interfere with employers\u2019 hiring decisions and conduct codes. A small minority argue that civil-rights statutes are poor tools for mediating conflicts, in general. \u201cIf you\u2019re serious about trying to keep good workplace relationships, the last thing you want is to have a series of confrontations with ACLU types and lawyers pushing on both sides,\u201d said Epstein. \u201cI regard this as an absolute catastrophe for the way in which you maintain worker relations.\u201d\n\nBut Katie Eyer, a law professor at Rutgers University, doesn\u2019t think the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in these cases will necessarily follow clear ideological lines. \u201cI really do think this is a case in which people\u2019s intuitions\u201d about the justices\u2019 ideology \u201care butting up against the methodological commitments of those same justices,\u201d she told me.\n\nThe possibility for a surprise outcome, Eyer said, lies in the influence of textualism, the legal theory that guides certain conservative justices. While some scholars, like Epstein, argue that Title VII should not cover LGBTQ people because Congress never meant for it to do so, \u201cthe basic premise of textualism is that we have to have our legal decisions controlled by the words that Congress used, rather than any sort of subjective sense of what Congress intended,\u201d Eyer said. She believes the meaning of sex plainly includes expressions of gender and sexuality, and that at least one conservative justice may agree. As evidence, she cited the Court\u2019s unanimous 1998 decision in Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., in favor of a man, Joseph Oncale, who was sexually harassed by other men who worked with him on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. The author of that decision was none other than the Court\u2019s foremost champion of textualism, Antonin Scalia, who was replaced by an ardent admirer of his and who, too, is a committed textualist: Neil Gorsuch.", "description": "The Supreme Court that will hear LGBTQ discrimination cases this week is radically different from the Court that legalized same-sex marriage four years ago.", "authors": ["Emma Green"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/AP_19166729814828/facebook.jpg?1570486672", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
