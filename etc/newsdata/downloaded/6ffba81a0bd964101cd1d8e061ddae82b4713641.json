Muro said yes, prepared meticulously, and got the split-decision victory on the scorecards.\n\nMuro was still buzzing after his victory when he faced the media at the post-fight press conference and waxed lyrical about his enthusiasm for the opportunity that presented itself.\n\n\u201cWhen I got this fight offered to me, I jumped on it, because I know that Nick is a quality opponent and he had a big, huge fanbase, and I\u2019m trying to make my mark as a martial artist that I\u2019m world class as well,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a quality guy, he\u2019s going to have a great career. He\u2019s going to go on to do amazing things. But I\u2019ve seen this as my opportunity to make a stand. They made it part of my contract that if I did put on a show right here that I would get a contract, and I want to be a signed Bellator fighter. I want to represent the company. They took care of me and my team from top to bottom, and it was just world-class.\u201d\n\nMuro (11-6 MMA, 2-0 BMMA) was largely unfancied as a potential winner heading into his bout with Newell (16-3 MMA, 1-1 BMMA) but, after leaving no stone unturned during his training camp, he produced a competitive display to outpoint \u201cNotorious\u201d on two of the three judges\u2019 scorecards and claim his second victory as a Bellator fighter.\n\n\u201cWe almost over-prepared,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were meticulous. My main training partners were ONE FC fighters, Bellator fighters, UFC fighters. And when you go against that type of competition, that prepares you for moments like this.\n\n\u201cYou have to prepare for moments like this, and I felt like we were prepared. We settled down, and we got into positions that were favorable for us, and it ended up turning out in our favor, so thank God for all that.\u201d\n\nMuro says he\u2019s shooting for the stars and hopes to snag himself a big-name opponent for his next matchup. He even had a specific opponent in mind as he called his shot from the dais for a fight against former Bellator lightweight champion Brent Primus.\n\n\u201cThe reason I say that \u2013 and no disrespect to Brent at all \u2013 I want to fight for that \u201955 title,\u201d he smiled. \u201cI\u2019m 2-0 in this promotion. Yes, I\u2019ve had some adversity, but if your dreams aren\u2019t scaring you, you\u2019re not dreaming hard enough. That\u2019s my dream. It\u2019s nothing against Brent, but I want that belt.\u201d\n\nMuro has made the most of his opportunity thus far, and now he hopes he can represent his home state with pride as a contracted Bellator fighter moving forward.\n\n\u201cBeing from Oklahoma and my area, there\u2019s not a lot of people who get opportunities like this,\u201d he explained. \u201cMark my words right here: If Bellator signs me to a contract, I am coming for that belt.\n\n\u201cI have gotten through the bumps and bruises in this sport \u2013 everybody wins and everybody loses. But I am coming here to make a mark. I\u2019m not just here to just be a part of the promotion. I\u2019m trying to go to the highest level of this sport. I\u2019m trying to do that for my Native American people. I\u2019m trying to be an ambassador and show a little bit of my culture and what we\u2019re all about.\u201d", "description": "Manny Muro wants a fight with former lightweight champion Brent Primus following his victory over Nick Newell at Bellator 232.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "Matt Erickson", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Mike Bohn", "Farah Hannoun"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/manny-muro-bellator-232-post.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
