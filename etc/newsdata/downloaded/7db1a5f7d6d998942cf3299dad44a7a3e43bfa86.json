He said the purpose of the spreadsheet was to identify what he considered to be failed abortions, according to the Kansas City Star.\n\nThe spreadsheet included identification numbers and the date of each patient\u2019s last menstrual period, and was part of a wider investigation to determine whether patients returned to a St. Louis branch of Planned Parenthood more than once to complete their abortions, according to the Star. A state investigator also had access to the spreadsheet.\n\nThe state has alleged it discovered evidence of four women who needed to return to the clinic to \u201ccomplete\u201d their abortions, according to the Star. Planned Parenthood\u2019s attorneys found the spreadsheet through the legal discovery process, as it was attached to an email with the subject line \u201cDirector\u2019s Request.\u201d\n\nREAD: This state could become the first without an abortion clinic\n\n\u201cMissouri politicians have gone too far. This is government overreach at its worst,\" said Yamelsie Rodriguez, president of Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region, in a statement Tuesday.\n\nThe St. Louis clinic is currently fighting for the ability to continue performing abortions after the state\u2019s health department refused to renew its license over \u201cdeficiencies\u201d it found through an investigative process earlier this year.\n\nIn exchange for a renewed license, the state wanted Planned Parenthood to complete a series of tasks to be in compliance, including making its physicians available for state investigators. That was the only ask Planned Parenthood wouldn\u2019t agree to, since several of their physicians aren\u2019t direct employees and can\u2019t be forced into interviews.\n\nWilliams also testified Tuesday that two of those physicians have since been deposed, and that they were able to provide helpful information about the four incomplete abortions. That information led him to believe the state can find a workable solution with Planned Parenthood.\n\nREAD: These 5 states are the next battle grounds in the abortion wars\n\n\"While these things are very concerning \u2014 they are grave \u2014 I think going forward they are imminently fixable,\" Williams said, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe clinic is still open and performing abortions. The Administrative Hearing Commission\u2019s hearing will continue all week, but a ruling won\u2019t come until February at the earliest, according to the Associated Press.\n\nCover: Dr. Randall Williams, Director of the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, speaks with reporters outside the courthouse after Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer heard his testimony concerning the renewal of Planned Parenthood's abortion clinic license on Wednesday, June 5, 2019, in St. Louis.
