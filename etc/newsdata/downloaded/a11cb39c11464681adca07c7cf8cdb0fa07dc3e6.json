Several striking workers, all of them former Democrats, told me how they voted for Donald Trump in 2016 out of desperation. They believed Trump would deliver on his promise to keep jobs in America and negotiate good trade deals. Now, they feel betrayed.\n\nMidwestern working-class voters are not alone. In fact, a Reuters/Ipsos national Election Day poll in 2016 found that 75% of voters were looking for a \u201cstrong leader to take the country back from the rich and powerful.\u201d If we want to win back voters in Ohio and Michigan, we need to inspire them with a transformational vision of change, and not incrementalism that they\u2019ll again reject as inadequate in this moment of growing inequality.\n\nThis desire for bold change extends beyond the Midwest. Just a few years ago, the demand for a $15 per hour minimum wage was dismissed by critics \u2014 many of them Democrats \u2014 as unrealistic. But a powerful grassroots movement successfully challenged the status quo. The popularity of once-fringe ideas like \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d demonstrate that our movement is on the march.\n\nThere is one presidential candidate who has shown up and stood up as a champion on all these issues. We believe that candidate is Bernie Sanders. Throughout his career, he has unapologetically embraced the progressive ideas that are now dominating the debates and gaining support from Americans across the country.\n\nOUR VIEW: Trump and GOP have ace in the hole for 2020. It's the Democratic Party.\n\nIn Lansing, Michigan, on Oct. 16, 2019.

In the upcoming election, states like Ohio and Michigan will go to the candidate who does more than promise real change, but has spent his entire career building a movement to deliver it.\n\nJoseph Geevarghese is the executive director of Our Revolution.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/10/21/betrayed-trump-voters-want-leader-take-america-back-editorials-debates/4058387002/", "description": "2020 candidate needs to inspire voters with a transformational vision of change, not incrementalism, writes Joseph Geevarghese of Our Revolution.", "authors": ["Joseph Geevarghese", "Opinion Contributor", "Published P.M.
