While other candidates have issued white paper after white paper, the former vice president has harped on the necessity of voting for the candidate who has the best chance at defeating the incumbent next November\u2014a candidate who, at least as the early polls tell it, just happens to have the name Joe Biden.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s an explicit \u201cplay it safe\u201d approach and one aimed at Democrats who are concerned big policy ideas will alienate general election voters. \u201cThis is do-or-die, and Joe Biden is the best candidate to go against Trump in November,\u201d Dick Harpootlian, a state senator in South Carolina told Vanity Fair in May. \u201cWould Joe Biden be running if he thought any of these other folks could beat Donald Trump? No way. We can\u2019t risk this thing with someone who has not done this before, who is unchallenged, who is untested. There is something to be said for two old white guys going at it,\u201d Harpootlian, who is himself white, said. \u201cThe African Americans in the State Senate with me are going to be with him overwhelmingly. Because this is a pragmatic year. This isn\u2019t a battle of ideologies or identity or Medicare for All or a Green New Whatever. It\u2019s all about who can stop this juvenile narcissist from getting a second term.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe frontrunner\u2019s wife, Dr. Jill Biden, made a revealing pass at this argument earlier this week, telling New Hampshire voters \u201cYou know you may like another candidate better but you have to look at who\u2019s going to win\u2026. So yes, you know, your candidate might be better on, I don\u2019t know, health care than Joe is, but you\u2019ve got to look at who\u2019s going to win this election, and maybe you have to swallow a little bit and say, \u2018Okay, I personally like so-and-so better,\u2019 but your bottom line has to be that we have to beat Trump.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis is not exactly the stuff of which inspiring campaigns are made. It\u2019s condescending at best\u2014existential policy imperatives like climate change and health care are hardly trivial, regardless of who occupies the White House\u2014but it also contains an air of menace. Biden and his supporters are trying to create a binary choice: Vote for Joe and beat Trump, or don\u2019t vote for Joe and lose. But most early polling has suggested that any candidate with near-universal name recognition\u2014something that would automatically follow a major party presidential nomination\u2014would lead Trump in a head-to-head competition.\n\n\n\nIf voters are transitioning away from electability, that would be good news for Sanders and Warren, in particular. Both candidates have used policy as the backbone of their campaigns, and both have large and deeply loyal bases. Recent polling puts Warren and Sanders in the top tier of Democratic candidates; though they still trail Biden in most opinion polls, each have significant advantages should his campaign falter. Sanders, in particular, has gained momentum in recent weeks, releasing a flurry of policy proposals, including a $16 trillion plan to fight climate change and remake the country\u2019s energy infrastructure.\n\n", "description": "The Democrat still shines in most polls, but as a Trump loss grows more likely, the former V.P.'s \"electability\" pitch is losing its luster.", "authors": ["Alex Shephard"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/c72792da8c3c31be0084872acfb13bb19d329def.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg"}
