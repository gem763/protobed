(And if you don\u2019t want to, then, to quote some wise men, fuck off.) Armstrong has been an integral part of Britcom DNA since the early aughts as a writer and creator, and, thanks to the powers of streaming TV, most of his shows are a click away if you want to forget that whole Gerri and Roman thing ever happened. Enjoy, you slime puppies!\n\nPeep Show\n\nDavid Mitchell and Robert Webb, the crown princes of modern Britcoms, star as delightfully dysfunctional pals who live together in a drab London apartment complex and go about their lives to mixed success. But the real fun comes from their internal narration and literal \u201cpeeping\u201d point-of-view filming style. (And because it\u2019s always a good time to celebrate Olivia Colman, she\u2019s there too as an increasingly unhinged love interest.) Armstrong also frequently penned segments for the duo\u2019s sketch show, That Mitchell and Webb Look, but it\u2019s sadly unavailable to stream stateside.\n\nWhere to stream: Amazon Prime, Hulu\n\nFresh Meat\n\nA group of \u201cfreshers\u201d (first-year students) at a Manchester university have to learn how to co-habitate with each other in perfect harmony after being assigned to a random off-campus house \u2014 remember to meet the dorm deadline, kids! \u2014 while dealing with all those being-alone-for-the-first-time jitters. Ah, college! But soon the first year turns into the second and then the third, and what\u2019s that? These young adults have a ton of debt and a total lack of job prospects? At least they have tons of fun along the way, right?\n\nWhere to stream: Netflix, Hulu\n\nBabylon\n\nLondon\u2019s Metropolitan Police Service is having a bit of a crisis. Criminals are everywhere, just stabbin\u2019 and murderin\u2019 random folks all over the place, but that\u2019s the least of the force\u2019s problems \u2014 it has the worst PR team in the country. (Nay, world.) Enter a brash American (a pre\u2013The OA Brit Marling) who, as a new director of communications, is tasked with bringing everyone into the digital age whether they like it or not. Yeah, they mostly don\u2019t like it.\n\nWhere to stream: Amazon Prime\n\nThe Thick of It\n\nYou thought Logan Roy had a colorfully profane vocabulary? Fuckity-bye! Malcolm Tucker (the always welcome Peter Capaldi) plays the director of communications for every 10 Downing Street dweller, where he\u2019s passionate about few things other than (1) cursing out civil servants, (2) threatening civil servants with various levels of extreme violence, and (3) spinning the truth, baby. Armstrong would go on to co-write a film spinoff, In the Loop, which brings the main satirical action to D.C.\u2019s Department of State.\n\nWhere to stream: Amazon Prime, Hulu\n\nBlack Mirror \u2060\u2014 \u201cThe Entire History of You\u201d\n\nArmstrong is the only person other than Charlie Brooker to pen a Black Mirror episode, and this season-one melodrama is one of the show\u2019s best: In a world where everything is seen, heard, and recorded from a person\u2019s POV with \u201cgrain\u201d technology \u2014 and, yeesh, can be replayed whenever \u2014 a man is slowly driven insane by the suspicion that his wife (Doctor Who\u2019s Jodie Whittaker) cheated on him with an old acquaintance. And did we mention he\u2019s having a pretty shitty time at work? He can\u2019t catch a break!\n\nWhere to stream: Netflix", "description": "Jesse Armstrong, before creating \u2018Succession\u2019 for HBO, has a long history in the British TV comedy community.
