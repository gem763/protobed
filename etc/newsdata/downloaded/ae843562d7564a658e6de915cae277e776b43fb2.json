While most lead to impressive views, the best also offer insights into the historical, artistic, and religious thinking of their times.\n\nIn Milan, a highlight is strolling the rooftop of the city's cathedral (duomo) and the third-largest church in Europe. After taking the stairs or elevator to the top, visitors can climb up and down the roof's multiple terraces, wandering among gargoyles, statues, and frilly spires.\n\nEach of the church's 135 spires is similar, yet different. Climbing through the forest of these lovingly decorated spires, it's inspiring to think that every detail \u2013 each flower, saint's face, and so on \u2014 is an individual work of art carved out of pink marble centuries ago by artists who believed that few would ever see it. Their art was a gift for God to enjoy from the heavens.\n\nThe marble stairs at Milan's Duomo allow you to get a close look at each of its 135 spires and other details.

Though it was built when the Gothic style dominated Europe, the Florentines decided not to cap their cathedral with a spire, leaving it with a gaping hole while waiting for technology to catch up with the city's vision for a dome instead. In 1420, Filippo Brunelleschi won the job and built the dome that kicked off the architectural Renaissance.\n\nThe top of Florence's famous dome is encircled by a tiny terrace that rewards climbers with fine views over the city.

Today, it rewards those who climb the 463 steep, narrow steps with glorious views.\n\nAlong the way, climbers are treated to a close-up of the dome's Last Judgment ceiling painting, a grand view of the cathedral's interior, and a look at Brunelleschi's \"dome-within-a-dome\" construction. Because the dome climb is so popular, reservations are required.\n\nWhile climbing the 463 steps inside Florence's Santa Maria dome, visitors get a glimpse of the Last Judgment ceiling fresco by Giorgio Vasari and Federico Zuccari.

Completed in the late 19th century, the German parliament building was gutted by a mysterious fire and World War II bombs, then stood like a ghost, barely repaired, through the Cold War. But after German reunification, this historic ruin was rebuilt with a modern element: a striking glass dome.\n\nDetail of the Reichstag in Berlin at dusk.

Climbers see forests of skyscrapers interspersed with historic sights, such as the nearby Brandenburg Gate and the Berlin Cathedral's massive copper dome.\n\nBut for Germans, mindful of their dark 20th-century history, the view that matters most is inside, looking down through a skylight to see over the shoulders of their legislators. The architecture comes with a poignant message: The people are determined to keep a wary eye on their government. And the dome is so popular that reservations are required to climb it.\n\nAt the Reichstag in Berlin, visitors are treated to endless vistas as they spiral up the 80-foot-high glass dome.

Built for the 1889 World's Fair, the project celebrated the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution and demonstrated that France had the wealth, knowledge, and can-do spirit to erect a structure taller than anything the world had ever seen.\n\nSmart travelers book their tower visit months in advance. Even with a reservation, many stand in long lines to take the elevators up and down. For hardy visitors, it's cheaper and less crowded to climb the stairs. It's quite a hike \u2013 720 steps up to the second level (the top level is only accessible via elevator), so I prefer to take the stairs down. It takes minutes, and it gives you an up-close look at Gustave Eiffel's amazing engineering.\n\nClimb the stairs to the second level of the Eiffel Tower and you'll be treated to this view of Monteparnasse.

In AD 326, Emperor Constantine's mother brought home what was reputed to be the marble steps of Pontius Pilate's residence in Jerusalem. Jesus is said to have climbed these steps on the day he was sentenced to death. Today the steps are covered with wooden slats to protect the marble, but they're spotted with glass-covered holes to show stains from Jesus' blood on the original stairs.\n\nIn AD 326, Emperor Constantine's mother brought home what was reputed to be the marble steps of Pontius Pilate's residence in Jerusalem.

And for decades, I watched them from a staircase on the side. But finally one year, a voice inside me said, \"Do it!\" and I tried the climb myself. With my knees screaming, weathered faithful struggling up the staircase beside me, and a fresco of a crucified Christ high above, I climbed each step, learning about both the bone structure of my knees and the value of pain when praying.\n\nFrom hiking to the top of the first Renaissance dome to climbing steps on your knees, a little exertion can mean a big payoff in your travels.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/advice/2019/10/16/take-stairs-eiffel-tower-reichstag-and-italys-cathedrals/3996117002/", "description": "From church domes to bell towers, fanciful rooftops to sky-piercing monuments, Europe is full of climbable structures.", "authors": ["Rick Steves", "Special To Usa Today", "Published P.M.
