This, researchers say, proves they can understand others' mental states\n\nWHAT IS THEORY OF MIND? Theory of mind is a higher cognitive function which allows individuals to understand others' mental states. Debate about whether any nonhuman species possess this ability has spanned decades. Theory of mind is the ability to attribute mental states \u2014 such as beliefs, intents, desires, emotions and knowledge \u2014 to oneself and others. This capacity is crucial for everyday social interactions. In humans, those that lack the ability can suffer from autism, schizophrenia and ADHD.\n\nThe study, published in the journal PNAS, assessed chimpanzees, bonobos and orangutans \u2014 our closest relatives.\n\nIt found that they rely on self-experience to anticipate others' actions.\n\nStudy author Dr Fumihiro Kano, a primate psychologist at Kyoto University in Japan, said: 'The results suggest we share this ability with our evolutionary cousins.'\n\nTheory of mind is the ability to attribute mental states \u2014 such as beliefs, intents, desires, emotions and knowledge \u2014 to oneself and others.\n\nThis capacity is crucial for everyday social interactions and has found to be lacking in those with autism, schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\n\nThe researchers used eye-tracking technology to monitor the gaze of apes exposed to various pranks carried out by an actor dressed in a King Kong suit.\n\nThe apes were shown a film which they found exciting and the eye-tracking was used to record gaze patterns indicating anticipation of an agent's behaviour.\n\nThey could tell if the individual was making a mistake and anticipate the agents' actions.\n\nThis held true even when that individual had a false belief about reality \u2014 one of the strongest pieces of evidence that they read their mind.\n\nDr Kano said: 'For close evolutionary relatives, you could say we look somewhat similar.\n\n'And the more we learn about our great ape cousins, the more we find that we're alike.'\n\nResearchers then expanded the study to look at how the apes dealt with a complex test of their cognitive ability.\n\nThey conducted a so-called 'trick blindfold test', which involved putting apes on one side of two barriers.\n\nOne group was put in front of a 'true' barrier, made of an opaque material.\n\nThe other was given a 'trick' one which appears to be opaque from a distance but becomes transparent up close.\n\nThe study, published in the journal PNAS, assessed chimpanzees, bonobos and orangutans - our closest relatives. It found they rely on self-experience to anticipate others' actions (stock)\n\nBoth groups of apes then watched the same video where a person hides behind the barrier while another object moves in front of it.\n\nThis barrier is identical in appearance to the ones experienced by the apes.\n\nIt gave the apes the mental quandary to predict where the person would go.\n\nThe team observed that, with the opaque barrier, the apes anticipated that the agent would go to the location that the agent had last seen.\n\nConversely, with the trick barrier, the apes anticipated that the agent would go to neither location, because the object had been removed entirely.\n\nThe apes were able to make the correct inference \u2014 ruling out a purely behavioural explanation.\n\nThe two groups anticipated the behaviour based on their own experiences with the barriers \u2014 even when both had observed the individual acting in an identical manner.\n\nDr Kano said: 'We are excited to find great apes actually passed this difficult test.'\n\n'We plan to continue refining our methods to test further non-mentalistic alternatives to the theory of mind in nonhuman animals.'", "description": "Japanese researchers say this proves they can understand others' mental states - an ability previously though exclusively reserved to humans.", "authors": ["Joe Pinkstone For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/30/16/19112380-0-image-a-26_1569856615040.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
