Without all of the hoopla in the market, the company just reported one of the largest quarterly revenues. With a market valuation now below $1 billion, the U.S. multi-state operator offers a compelling value without the aggressive spending rampant in the sector.\n\nNot So Small\n\nTrulieve is very focused on the Florida cannabis market possibly causing the typical investor to look past the company. A lot of investors were attracted to the Canadian LPs due to the global expansion possibilities, but those haven\u2019t panned out as much as expected.\n\nTrulieve is a much larger organization than most probably think. The company has over 2,000 employees now with 30 retail stores open in Florida. The total cultivation space is now up to 1.6 million square feet to meet the needs of 192,000 patients. The amount doesn\u2019t match the Canadian operators, but a production capacity of 62,000 kg in a single state better matches supply with demand.\n\nIn the last few months, Trulieve has quietly made entries into California, Connecticut and Massachusetts. The company only has access to single dispensaries in Palm Springs, CA and Bristol, CT along with three locations in Massachusetts. The current plans aren\u2019t large, but Trulieve is definitely poised to grow beyond the Florida market.\n\nProfit Machine\n\nIn a sector where plenty of companies aren\u2019t focused enough on generating a profit, Trulieve is far ahead of the pack. In Q2 alone, the company generated an adjusted EBITDA of $31.6 million, up 60% from $19.0 million in March.\n\nThe company turned revenues of $57.9 million and 67% gross margins into an EBITDA margin reaching an incredible 55%. The focus on one particular market or state and slow expansion has left Trulieve in a far better position to expand in a logical method along with the cannabis sector assets now on sale. The only hiccup with Trulieve generating such large margins is the IRS tax code currently doesn\u2019t allow for the deduction of operating expenses to reduce the tax bill.\n\nA prime example of the benefits are the quarterly operating expenses of only $14.8 million or ~25% of revenues. Several Canadian players are achieving similar revenue levels with operating expenses in excess of gross profits. Trulieve is far more efficient.\n\nWith analysts forecasting 2020 revenues approaching $400 million and the stock valuation down at only $900 million, new investors will likely be happy the company took the slow and steady path to growth. Only as recently as April, the stock traded above $15 and hit a 52-week high of $21. With the stock at $8, the founders are committed to not sell shares until July 2020 via a voluntary lock-up agreement. Another sign of the value in the stock when the founders have not reason to extend a lockup.\n\nThe Street's Predicting Significant Gains\n\nThis cannabis player stands as a 'Strong Buy' name among Wall Street analysts. In the last three months, Trulieve has won three bullish recommendations. With a return potential of close to 180%, the stock's consensus price target lands at $23.54.
