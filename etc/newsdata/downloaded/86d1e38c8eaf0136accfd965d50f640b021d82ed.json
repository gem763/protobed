Demonstrators stormed the city\u2019s shopping district and set fire to Chinese banks.\n\nPolice said a 14-year-old boy was shot in the thigh, but said it was unclear if he was hit by a stray bullet or shot by a police officer who fired his gun after being attacked by a group of protesters.\n\nThe Hospital Authority said a 14-year-old boy was taken to hospital and was last night in serious condition.\n\nThe incident would mark the second time live rounds have been fired against protesters since the demonstrations began.\n\nThe face-mask ban invokes colonial-era emergency powers for the first time since the UK handed the city back to China in 1997.\n\nPolice fired tear gas and all metro services to Hong Kong Island were halted as some stations also came under attack from protesters.\n\nThe new face mask law will ban demonstrators from covering their faces in full or partially to prevent their identification during protests, marches or illegal assemblies, with violators facing up to one year of imprisonment or a maximum fine of $3,190.\n\nAuthorities sent in rows of riot police to quell the protests Credit: NICOLAS ASFOURI/AFP More\n\nAt a press conference flanked by her most senior ministers, Carrie Lam, the embattled Chief Executive, said the government enacted the unpopular measure out of duty to \u201cend violence and restore order\u201d to the city, which was now in a \u201cvery critical state of public danger\u201d after four months of anti-government protests.\n\nThe decision to invoke the colonial-era Emergency Regulations Ordinance to push through the face mask ban was \u201cdifficult but necessary for the public interest\u201d after scenes of chaos and panic, she argued.\n\nAs protesters gathered following the announcement, China voiced support for \"extremely necessary\" ban.\n\nThe new law is aimed primarily at students, the most active participants in the city\u2019s protests, which began in June against a contentious bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China, but has since snowballed into a demand for greater rights, including universal suffrage.\n\nSchools across the financial hub have already been issued with details of the \u201cAnti-mask act.\u201d\n\nThe ban was introduced after the worst street violence in decades this week when an 18-year-old demonstrator was shot and critically wounded during a clash with the police.
