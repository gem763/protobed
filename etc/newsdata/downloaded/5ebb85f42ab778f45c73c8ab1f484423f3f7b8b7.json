Gen. Abdul Moqim Abdulrahimzai, the director general of operations and plans for the Interior Ministry and one of the officials who oversaw election security plans nationwide.\n\nBut when the polls closed, \u00adAfghan officials and civilians breathed a sigh of relief. The Taliban launched more than 200 attacks that day, but they were small and scattered. The Defense Ministry said indirect fire and small explosives killed five civilians and wounded 76 nationwide.\n\nThe relative calm on election day is a rare success for the country\u2019s military and police forces, which have struggled in combat with the Taliban. Afghan and American officials attribute the low toll to aggressive planning and coordination, after months of intense military pressure on Taliban strongholds.\n\nBut some Afghan security officials caution that the successes of election day may not be easily repeated: The number of forces needed to secure the country and the tempo of operations is unsustainable in the daily battle against insurgent groups. Others say that while large attacks were thwarted, daily life in the country was forced to a halt.\n\n\n\nAfghan security forces watch the streets outside a polling station in last month\u2019s presidential election.

Security concerns and fears of fraud appear to have resulted in the country\u2019s lowest voter turnout since the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001 \u2014 less than a third of registered voters turned up at the polls, according to official tallies.\n\nBoth President Ashraf Ghani, who is seeking reelection, and his top challenger, Abdullah Abdullah, have said they expect to win, but results are not expected until mid-October.\n\nGen. Scott Miller, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, said election security \u201cwas very well-done considering the threats.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was perhaps most \u00adimpressive was seeing the different security pillars and civil \u00adauthorities become well-integrated so people who chose to vote were able to get to the polls,\u201d he said in a statement to The \u00adWashington Post.\n\nThe plan to secure the capital had been in the works for months. Police forces in Kabul worked closely with the National Directorate of Security, the country\u2019s main intelligence agency, to collect and share intelligence on possible Taliban targets.\n\n\u201cIt was like a chain,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Sayed Rashandil, Kabul\u2019s chief of police. As his forces began conducting more raids, they gathered more information on potential targets, allowing the operations to expand.\n\n\u201cWe went on the offensive before [the Taliban] had a chance, and we took the fight to them,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the days leading up to the election, movement in and out of the Afghan capital was restricted, large trucks were banned and cars were subject to additional searches. By the morning of Sept. 28, traffic had slowed to a trickle and Kabul\u2019s streets were almost entirely deserted.\n\nBut in the days that have followed the vote, Rashandil said, additional barriers have been taken down, reinforcements have returned to their usual posts and intelligence-sharing has dropped off.\n\n\u201cThere is no way that we could keep up all those checkpoints every day,\u201d said Maj. Ahmad Zamary Toofan, a police commander in Kabul.\n\nOutside Kabul, operations had been going on for months. In the country\u2019s north and west, Afghan army special operations forces largely led attacks on Taliban strongholds. Police and National Directorate of Security special forces conducted dozens of raids in the Afghan capital and in pockets of Taliban influence farther afield.\n\n\n\nAn Afghan soldier watches the crowd during the final campaign rally for Abdullah Abdullah in Bamian, Afghanistan, ahead of last month\u2019s presidential elections.

When talks were scuttled, Taliban attacks increased and Afghan military pressure was ratcheted up further. More than 200 civilians were killed and 500 injured in conflict-related violence in September, according to an Afghan security official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the civilian toll.\n\nAccording to a U.S. government report released earlier this year, the Taliban controls more territory and is launching more attacks than at any other time since 2001. Much of that expanded control is in Afghanistan\u2019s less populated rural districts. Government forces have responded by concentrating on securing cities and towns, but that has left remote urban areas exposed.\n\n\u201cCompared to past elections, the Taliban are much closer now,\u201d Fatima Aziz, a member of parliament from Kunduz, said as her province began preparations for the vote. Security forces surrounded the provincial capital with checkpoints and barriers \u201clike a belt.\u201d\n\nKunduz was a focus of Taliban attacks after the launch of the spring fighting season and throughout months of peace talks. In August, Taliban fighters attempted to overrun the provincial capital but were pushed back.\n\n\u201cWe took preparations, but the Taliban also took preparations,\u201d Aziz said in the days leading up to the election. \u201cThey deployed more fighters to the districts they control, and our forces even saw increased Taliban movement in districts where we normally do not see them.\u201d On election day, the Taliban hit Kunduz city with rocket fire and a suicide bomb. After the vote, Aziz said the only reason civilians were not killed in the attacks was that so few people came out to vote.\n\nThe Taliban cheered the low voter turnout. In an official statement, the group said the turnout amounted to \u201cthe absolute rejection and boycott by the nation\u201d and reflected the \u201cshrewdness\u201d of the Afghan people.\n\nBrig. Gen. Zabihullah Moh\u00admand, who leads Afghan army forces in Helmand province, said he was saddened so many people stayed away from the polls because of Taliban threats. But regardless, he said, the election boosted the morale of his troops and dealt a blow to the Taliban.\n\n\u201cThey are just telling their fighters to place [roadside bombs], to carry out operations that are easy for them,\u201d Mohmand said of intercepted Taliban communications he has seen in recent days. He said that as long as the Afghan army continues to receive U.S. air support and targeting assistance, he does not expect operations to slow.\n\n\n\nAn Afghan soldier stands guard inside the election commission in Kabul ahead of last month\u2019s elections in Afghanistan.
