I went into the house, which was tidy, and there was no sign of him.\n\n\"When I opened the side door to the garage, I could see the family car. The engine was not turned on. Peter was slumped forward in the front.\"\n\nHandwritten signs warning of carbon monoxide were taped to the rear windows of the car.\n\nMr Fairris called the emergency services and PC Paul Headen, who is based in Winchester, attended the scene.\n\nPC Headen told Winchester Coroner's Court: \"When I opened the car door, there were strong fumes.\n\n\"There were no notes left, but all of Mr McMaster's financial information, along with the details of his and his wife's wills were left out in organised folders.\n\n\"The fire service made the vehicle safe and we helped the body out of the car.\n\n\"Mr McMaster had last been seen by his daughter around five days before. I had been informed that she was on her way down from London.\n\n\"It was difficult to tell her what had happened when she arrived.\"\n\nSenior coroner Grahame Short concluded death by suicide.\n\nHe said: \"Mr McMaster was struggling with his wife's care. He made careful preparations, sorting out his financial papers and details of the will and leaving them out.\n\n\"He deliberately inhaled the fumes. This was unfortunately a planned act.\"\n\nIf you need to speak to someone, Samaritans are available 24/7 on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org", "description": "Peter McMaster was found slumped forward in the family car inside the home's garage in Winchester, Hampshire", "authors": ["Kelly-Ann Mills", "Image", "Alamy Stock Photo"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20664118.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Southampton-and-Western-coroners-court-The-Castle-Winchester-Image-shot-092015-Exact-date-unkn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
