Somehow it ended with an unlikely campaign to keep pop star \u2013 and high-school dropout \u2013 Lorde out of jail.\n\nLast week domestic media reported the opposition National party was considering fining the parents of early-school leavers NZ$3,000 if it won next year\u2019s election. The fine would apply to the parents of students who were not progressing onto further study or employment. It is currently legal to leave high school at 16 in New Zealand.\n\nThe proposal was widely derided as draconian and heavy-handed, with many news outlets compiling lists of successful New Zealanders who left school early, including Lorde, choreographer Parris Goebel who works with Rihanna and Justin Bieber, All Black Sonny Bill Williams and even the National party\u2019s deputy leader Paula Bennett.\n\nLorde was a student at Takapuna grammar school in Auckland until 2013, when she left to pursue her budding music career.\n\nThe mention of Lorde\u2019s name unleashed a slew of passionate memes, expressing concern that Grammy-award winning Lorde could face jail time or a hefty fine for failing to finish high school. Neither of these things will happen.\n\n\u201cLorde saved us and the music industry with Melodrama.
