Col. Alexander Vindman, CNN anchor Brianna Keilar took aim at her colleague by calling out his \u201canti-immigrant bigotry\u201d while mocking him over his reality-TV past.\n\nPiggybacking on talking points that had been pushed by other right-wing pundits, Duffy, a former Republican congressman, suggested on Tuesday morning that Vindman\u2014a Ukrainian-American immigrant who is testifying that he reported concerns about President Donald Trump\u2019s infamous July call to the Ukrainian president\u2014was more loyal to Ukraine than to America.\n\n\u201cIt seems very clear that [Vindman] is incredibly concerned about Ukrainian defense,\u201d Duffy said during Tuesday\u2019s broadcast of CNN\u2019s New Day. \u201cI don\u2019t know about his concern [for] American policy, but his main mission was to make sure the Ukraine got those weapons. I understand it: We all have an affinity to our homeland where we came from.\u201d\n\nDuffy went on to note that Vindman, who is the NSC\u2019s top Ukraine expert, \u201cspeaks Ukrainian\u201d while reiterating that the Iraq War veteran has \u201can affinity\u201d for Ukraine and \u201cwants to make sure they\u2019re safe and free.\u201d His comments echoed those of Fox News hosts Laura Ingraham and Brian Kilmeade, fellow Trump-boosting cable-news stars.\n\nIn response, during her own broadcast, Keilar did not hold back.\n\n\u201cNo one who knows what they\u2019re talking about would call that espionage,\u201d she stated. \u201cIt is literally Vindman\u2019s job to talk to Ukrainians. And the prevailing view on U.S. foreign policy is the money going to Ukraine is a counterbalance to Russia, a U.S. foe. It\u2019s pretty easy stuff, but not for former Republican Congressman and CNN contributor Sean Duffy.\u201d\n\nKeilar then dunked on Duffy by contrasting his resum\u00e9 with Vindman\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThat is some anti-immigrant bigotry and it\u2019s an odd questioning of patriotism coming from Sean Duffy, the guy who spent part of his 20s on MTV\u2019s The Real World and Real World/Road Rules Challenge while Alexander Vindman spent his on foreign deployments, including one to Iraq where he earned a Purple Heart after being injured by a roadside bomb.\u201d\n\nDuffy, for his part, attempted to walk back his on-air comments on Twitter on Tuesday, stating that Vindman is \u201can American war hero\u201d while claiming that his larger point is \u201cthat Mr. Vindman is an unelected advisor, he gives ADVICE. President Trump sets the policy.\u201d\n\nDuffy has made quite an impression during his short tenure with CNN. In his first two appearances for the network last week, he was chastised on-air for pushing the president\u2019s debunked conspiracy theory that suggests Ukraine was actually behind the hack of the DNC servers. During another segment, fellow CNN contributor and Republican ex-congressman Charlie Dent pointed out that unlike Duffy, \u201cmy nose is not a heat-seeking missile for the president\u2019s backside.\u201d", "description": "Brianna Keilar contrasted Duffy\u2019s past on MTV\u2019s \u201cThe Real World\u201d with Vindman\u2019s combat experience resulting in a Purple Heart.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_360,w_640,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572374925/cnn-right-now-brianna-keilar_2_oldvz5", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
