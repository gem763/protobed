The official, who was not authorized to openly discuss private conversations and requested anonymity, said Mulvaney was acting to help Trump but it was not clear whether Trump actually asked him to act.\n\nNOAA said in a statement last Friday that National Weather Service forecasters in Birmingham, Alabama, \u201cspoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.\u201d The statement raised questions of whether NOAA was placing politics over science in its priorities and has prompted an investigation from the Commerce Department\u2019s inspector general and a House committee.\n\nTrump was asked if he told Mulvaney to disavow the Alabama forecasters. \u201cNo, I never did that,\u201d the president said, then called the story a hoax.\n\nMany of his comments about the storm have defended his erroneous claim that Alabama was likely to face significant impact from Dorian. On Friday evening, NOAA issued an unsigned statement that came to the president\u2019s defense and seemed critical of the National Weather Service in Birmingham.\n\nSpeaking to a meteorology group Tuesday, acting NOAA administrator Neil Jacobs said the statement was meant to clarify \u201ctechnical aspects\u201d about Dorian\u2019s potential impact.\n\n\u201cWhat it did not say, however, was that we understood and fully support the good intent of the Birmingham weather forecast office, which was to calm fears in support of public safety,\u201d Jacobs said.\n\nThe Commerce Department\u2019s internal watchdog, Peggy Gustafson, is examining the circumstances surrounding NOAA\u2019s statement and has requested records of all communications, including emails and text messages. She also wants a description of all calls and meetings on the issue. She requested the information from Jacobs.\n\nDemocratic leaders on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee wrote Ross on Wednesday requesting a briefing with department employees who may have been involved in any directives to NOAA related to the agency\u2019s statement critical of the forecasters in Birmingham.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to supporting the activities of the NWS and its dedicated staff,\u201d said Reps. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Texas, and Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J. \u201cDuring your Senate confirmation hearing, you committed to allowing federal scientists to \u2018be free to communicate data clearly and concisely\u2019 and that you would \u2018not interfere with the release of factual scientific data.\u2019 However, actions by you that were described in the New York Times article would, if accurate, be inconsistent with the values of scientific integrity.\u201d\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writer Jonathan Lemire contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday denied instructing an aide to urge a federal agency to repudiate weather forecasters who contradicted his claim that Hurricane Dorian could hit Alabama.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kevin Freking"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/11/trump_vaping_37594_c0-0-5182-3021_s1770x1032.jpg?af53fe12df7eded92578feb9bd9637de1aa005cd", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
