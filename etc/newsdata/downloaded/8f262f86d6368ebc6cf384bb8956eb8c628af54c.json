And world leaders have said India\u2019s move means a conflict between the two nuclear powers may be closer than ever.\n\nDespite that, an American member of Congress from California is urging his colleagues to appear with the country\u2019s prime minister at a massive rally in Houston on Sept. 22. The event, called \u201cHowdy, Modi!\u201d includes a segment purporting to honor human rights heroes.\n\nRep. Brad Sherman, a California Democrat, sent a letter to members of Congress on Aug. 23 asking them to participate in the event. The letter says Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will appear at a reception at NRG Park\u2014where the Houston Texans play\u2014with 50,000 people. The event will be broadcast to more than 300 million people, according to Sherman\u2019s letter, and \u201cwill include a segment honoring the great work of human rights leaders Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a co-Chair [of the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian-Americans], I hope that you will participate in welcoming Prime Minister Modi to Houston,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMembers of Congress who participate will get a bit of airtime. According to the event schedule in Sherman\u2019s letter, the members will be introduced on stage right before Modi begins delivering an address.\n\nThe invitation has raised eyebrows on the Hill.\n\n\u201cIndia is a friend and ally,\u201d said one member of Congress, who requested anonymity to speak candidly. \u201cBut no Member or Senator should join a pep rally for Modi as long as India is holding people without charge, cutting off communications to people in Kashmir, and provoking a nuclear-armed neighbor.\u201d\n\nAnd Brad Adams, who heads the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch, cautioned members against participating in the rally.\n\n\u201cModi presided over the worst anti-Muslim violence in the last generation, in 2002 in Gujra when he was the chief minister of the state,\u201d Adams said. \u201cIf they are comparing him to Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., then they\u2019re demeaning the legacies of two of the world\u2019s great human rights champions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that any members of Congress who would attend such an event doesn\u2019t know better,\u201d he added.\n\nSherman, who chairs the Asia subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, defended his involvement in a statement.\n\n\u201cAs Democratic Chair of the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans, of course it is my role to let my colleagues know that the prime minister of India is coming to our country and that they are invited to attend,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are 4 million Indian-Americans who have made significant contributions to our country and it would be an insult not to recognize them. The U.S. and India have a deep security relationship and many common interests in the Indo-Pacific. It would be a mistake not to recognize that. I think the fact that the event recognizes the monumental human rights achievements of Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. King is a reason to attend, not a reason to abstain from attending. I do have serious concerns about Kashmir and other human rights issues in South Asia, and that\u2019s why I am planning a Hearing on Human Rights in South Asia.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Texas India Forum, which is organizing the \u201cHowdy, Modi!,\u201d said the event \u201cbrings together tens of thousands of Americans who believe in the values we share with the world's largest democracy\u201d and \u201ccelebrates India\u2019s progress towards becoming a nation free of corruption, where citizens\u2014without any distinction\u2014have access to healthcare, electricity, sanitation, infrastructure, education and the freedom to pursue their dreams.\u201d\n\nSherman\u2019s subcommittee announced earlier this month that it will soon hold a hearing on human rights in the region, including the situation in Kashmir.\n\n\u201cI had an opportunity to meet with Americans from Kashmir Valley just a week ago in the San Fernando Valley, along with my colleague Congressman Andr\u00e9 Carson,\u201d Sherman said in a press release announcing the hearing. \u201cWe heard stories of difficulties encountered by my constituents and others, and the fears they have for their loved ones. I look forward to learning more about human rights in Kashmir.\u201d", "description": "Never mind the Indian government\u2019s Kashmir crackdown\u2014Rep.
