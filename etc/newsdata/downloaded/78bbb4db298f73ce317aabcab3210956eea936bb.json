Then we are restricting the level to which we want the game to develop. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to put a cap on it when this is the direction we want to go in,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIf other teams can start to get that funding, then we will all be able to move forward together, rather than restricting the teams that are [already] able to move forward.\u201d\n\nCrake, who started playing rugby at school in Bishop\u2019s Stortford aged 13, has to balance work as a dentist with rugby, but says there is nothing \u201cremarkable\u201d about her busy schedule: \u201cIt\u2019s a personal choice.\n\n\u201cThis year, now that I\u2019ve moved back [to London], I\u2019ve cut down my hours so I\u2019m only working two or three days a week.\n\n\u201cIf I wanted to work full-time I could, but fortunately I\u2019m in a profession where, although I\u2019m not paid a huge amount as I\u2019m a dentist for the NHS, not private, I can sacrifice my financial gains, so that I can hopefully achieve more in my rugby career.\u2019\u2019\n\nLast season, Crake commuted for 2\u00bd hours from Yeovil for matches and training sessions.\n\n\u201cIt was what I wanted and where I wanted to be, and Wasps is the club that I wanted to stay at,\u201d she added. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s what I\u2019ve always done. It\u2019s just what I love to do.\u201d\n\nBristol Bears against Wasps today, 12noon kick-off at Shaftesbury Park, will be the first match of the season streamed live online. It will be available on Premier15s.com and England Rugby\u2019s Facebook and YouTube channel.", "description": "With two wins from three matches at the start of the Tyrrells Premier 15s season, and a solid third place in the table to boot, optimism is rife at Wasps.", "authors": ["Charles Richardson", "Will Greenwood", "Mike Davison"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-union/2019/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000206116021-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqeuhc6i2ePKaFhTbgqDkxURFgRCY_t7_zAimQdP8ocpI.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
