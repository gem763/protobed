They had to cut the electric current, but I've been on the phone to him and he says he feels fine,\" said Gen Maj Vansina. Both pilots were only thought to require hospital checks before being released.\n\nOther photos appeared to show black smoke billowing from the nearby area and a damaged roof on one home, which was reportedly only 50m (164ft) from the site of the crash.\n\nResident Patrick Kauffer told Le T\u00e9l\u00e9gramme that a wing of the plane had taken out part of the roof of his house, causing serious damage.\n\nThe crash also set fire to his shed and nearby trees, he added.\n\nAnother resident, Cindy Le Gloanic, described seeing the pilots eject and posted photos of a damaged house.\n\nIn one photo, sheets of metal appeared to be on fire in a wooded clearing and another shows a nearby maize field in flames.\n\nThe plane was not carrying weapons during its flight, officials said. Built in 1983, the F-16 was apparently in good condition when it took off. The head of the air force said the pilot had told him there had been a problem with the engine during the flight and he had tried to restart it.", "description": "The Belgian jet's pilot is safe and well after being rescued from the line in north-western France.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/142FE/production/_108868628_6551ac50-248c-4ba2-8f87-ff2238cecb6e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
