Fortunately, it had a standard outlet inside.\n\nThe Medela pump Ms. Mascia uses \u201cis basically now an extension of my body,\u201d she said. She pumps overnight to maintain a breast milk supply for her son, born six weeks early. \u201cHe and I are still establishing an exclusive nursing relationship,\u201d she said.\n\n[Read our guide on how to breastfeed during the first two weeks of life.]\n\nMs. Mascia, 36, was among around 600,000 electricity customers who were without power on Thursday morning after California\u2019s largest utility, Pacific Gas and Electric, shut down electrical lines to try to prevent wildfires in Northern California. It was unclear how long the outage would last, but the company has said it could take up to five days to inspect the power lines and restore service .\n\nMothers who breastfeed scrambled to figure out how to continue pumping and storing breast milk, which cannot be refrozen if it is defrosted and can last only four to eight hours at room temperature, depending on how cleanly it is removed from the breast. In addition, women who pump regularly had to find a way to continue to do so in order to maintain their supply and avoid painful engorgement, which can lead to an infection requiring antibiotics.\n\nSerena Meyer , an international board-certified lactation consultant who runs the Facebook group Bay Area Breastfeeding Support, said women had been talking nonstop about how to continue breastfeeding and storing their stash of milk.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of fear and trauma for people with low milk production, risking the loss of something that\u2019s very, very important to their family, to their baby,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are really sad and worried, and they\u2019re trying to preserve their baby\u2019s way to feed.\u201d\n\nAt the Oakland hospital where Ms. Meyer works a few times a month, she handed out manual breast pumps on Wednesday. By the end of the day, they were all gone, she said.\n\nThe hand pumps are generally kept on hand for emergencies, but given the short notice of the outage, \u201cthere\u2019s no way that a bureaucracy such as a hospital can move fast enough to stock up,\u201d Ms. Meyer said. \u201cAnd nobody\u2019s going to see breastfeeding or breast milk storage as a high-acuity, emergent situation \u2014 except the people who are losing their breast milk.\u201d\n\nMs. Mascia was fortunate that her car outlet allowed her to continue pumping, but she didn\u2019t have anywhere to store her frozen breast milk \u2014 nearly 100 ounces in all.\n\nSo she turned to her friend Emily Mollenkopf, who had a large freezer in her basement in Berkeley and had not lost power as of Thursday morning.\n\nMs. Mollenkopf, who also has a 2-month-old, had about 50 bags of her own breast milk in the freezer and was able to fit in Ms. Mascia\u2019s supply as well.\n\nAs soon as she heard about a potential outage, \u201cI sprang into action,\u201d said Ms. Mollenkopf, who is unsure whether her home will be affected. She bought a generator just in case.\n\nMonica Hamlett , the owner of Fit4mom 510, which offers fitness classes for mothers in the Bay Area, created a Facebook support group to connect parents in Oakland and Berkeley during the power outage. Ms. Hamlett, the group\u2019s administrator, said on Wednesday that there was a \u201cconstant flow of people asking to join.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just kind of amazed at how many people are willing to help,\u201d she said. Many of the new members were offering their freezers or their homes to those in need. \u201cWe\u2019re all kind of preparing for the worst.\u201d\n\nAround the same time, a public spreadsheet began circulating with the contact information of those ready to help, including people with child-friendly spaces in their homes.\n\nSharon Savene , a La Leche League leader in Los Angeles, said women who had a stash of frozen breast milk and did not have access to a freezer could use dry ice in a cooler \u2014 regular ice won\u2019t keep things cold enough, she added. Depending on the size of the block of dry ice, the milk could last up to a day in the cooler.\n\nThat\u2019s what Janko Roettgers, 43, and his wife, Kimi Lee, did during a widespread blackout in Los Angeles that lasted several days in 2007.\n\nIn their case, the outage was unexpectedly produced by triple-digit temperatures. At the time, their first daughter was 3 months old, and Ms. Lee had spent many hours pumping milk to create a freezer supply of breast milk in preparation for her return to work.\n\n\u201cShe was very clear,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t go to waste.\u201d\n\nThey found a specialty store that sold dry ice and bought large blocks to keep the milk frozen in a cooler. To avoid the oppressive heat, \u201cwe had to spend our days basically in coffee shops and malls, and where there was air-conditioning,\u201d he said.\n\nDry ice and water have rapidly sold out in many areas of Northern California, however.\n\n\u201cThe stores look like they\u2019ve been ransacked,\u201d Ms. Meyer said.\n\nShe advised packing frozen breast milk as tightly as possible into the smallest insulated cooler available.\n\n\u201cAnd my suggestion is if you have a basement area, go put it down there where it\u2019s way cooler than room temperature,\u201d Ms. Meyer said.\n\nFor women who need to pump and do not have access to a generator or an electric car, Ms. Savene suggested checking to see if your pump has an adapter accessory that can be plugged into a battery pack, which can offer a couple of hours of pumping time. Other types of adapters can be plugged into nonelectric cars. Manual pumps are an affordable option that don\u2019t require electricity, but for some women they are difficult to use.\n\nAccording to the American Academy of Pediatrics, if you don\u2019t plan to use your breast milk within 24 hours, it should ideally be frozen. If you refrigerate it, it can be kept for up to eight days in the fridge, but it\u2019s best to use the refrigerated milk within four days. If frozen breast milk defrosts, it cannot be refrozen and must be either used or discarded.\n\n[Learn how to feed a combination of breast milk and formula.]\n\nChristina Caron is a parenting reporter at The New York Times.", "description": "As the state\u2019s largest utility began its deliberate outage, breastfeeding mothers found resourceful ways to keep pumping and prevent breast milk from spoiling.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/10/multimedia/parenting-freezer/parenting-freezer-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
