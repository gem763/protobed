The U.S. State Department in contrast has said that it brought \u201ccreative ideas\u201d to the table and had good discussions with Pyongyang in Stockholm.BY SARAH KIM [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
