My husband had lost his job in Austin, Tex., and was offered a new one in the Philadelphia suburbs, so we trucked our two children, two cats and an embarrassing amount of stuff cross-country to start our lives over from scratch. I tried to sound optimistic to our new neighbors: Moving is hard, but we\u2019re excited to put down roots here. I\u2019ve never lived in suburbia, but I love the giant trees. Inwardly, I howled: What have we done? I\u2019ve lost all my friends! Screw the trees!\n\nI helped my children settle in to their new schools and our temporary rental house, but I couldn\u2019t settle myself. My husband worked longer hours; on weekdays, we rarely saw him. I felt a sense of loneliness and isolation so deep that it seemed like someone had scooped out the insides of my bones. Among the boxes in our garage sat some that were decades old, filled with my parents\u2019 belongings. My mother had died of cancer nearly 25 years before, when I was still in my teens, and my father died of a heart attack seven years later. I ached for them now in a new way, especially my mother. I longed for her guaranteed love, her saying, Everything will be all right \u2014 a kernel of security I used to carry, but which had been lost somewhere along I-40 while our cats were strung out on cat Xanax, yowling a mournful tune.\n\nOne night after we arrived, I read an article about \u201cComplicated Grief,\u201d a diagnosis for bereavement lasting over six months. Six months? What would they say about 25 years?\n\nFor months, we house-hunted, and the cats hid under the blankets for hours; some days, I hid with them. I stared at the bedroom\u2019s cracked plaster ceiling and wondered why I wasn\u2019t coping better. I wasn\u2019t as resilient as I\u2019d thought, that was for sure \u2014 but maybe this move unearthed a deep, unfixable character flaw: an inability to handle life and stay happy.", "description": "I found a place to help me process decades of hidden grief.", "authors": ["Margo Rabb"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/05/opinion/05rabb/05rabb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
