REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nSupporters of the Republican president packed the 20,000-seat Target Center in Minneapolis for the first of three campaign rallies scheduled for the next week, with stops in Louisiana on Friday and Dallas in a week.\n\nTrump said the impeachment drama will drive up his support ahead of the November 2020 election and help him win re-election for another four-year term.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats\u2019 brazen attempt to overthrow the government will produce a backlash at the ballot box the likes of which they have never ever seen before in the history of this country,\u201d Trump said to cheers.\n\nThe Minneapolis event was Trump\u2019s first campaign rally since House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top U.S. Democrat, opened an impeachment inquiry on Sept. 24 against him on accusations that Trump sought Ukraine\u2019s help to investigate Democratic political rival Joe Biden and his son, businessman Hunter Biden.\n\nTrump made a personal attack on Hunter Biden and Joe Biden, a former senator and former vice president who served two four-year terms under President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cAnd your father was never considered smart,\u201d Trump told the rally. \u201cHe was never considered a good senator. He was only a good senator because he learned how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass.\u201d\n\nHe called Hunter Biden \u201ca loser\u201d and wondered aloud how he \u201cgot $1.5 billion.\u201d Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have repeatedly called the Bidens corrupt without providing any evidence.\n\nTrump returned to the subject of impeachment repeatedly during his speech, saying: \u201cDemocrats are on a crusade to destroy our democracy. We will never let it happen. We will defeat them.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s son, Eric Trump, warmed up the crowd by attacking Hunter Biden for his ties to Ukraine\u2019s energy industry while his father was vice president. He suggested Trump\u2019s 2016 \u201clock her up\u201d campaign cry against then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton should be applied to Hunter Biden.\n\n\u201cMaybe \u2018lock her up\u2019 goes to \u2018lock him up,\u2019\u201d the younger Trump said.\n\n\u201cLock him up! Lock him up!\u201d the crowd chanted.\n\nVice President Mike Pence also spoke, denouncing Democrats for pursuing \u201cpartisan politics\u201d and trying to \u201coverturn the will of the American people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe stand with Donald Trump,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump\u2019s appearance in Minnesota was aimed at trying to pluck away the state from Democratic hands. He lost Minnesota narrowly to Clinton in 2016 and, bidding to expand his electoral chances in 2020, made his stop to try to build his support in the state.\n\n\u201cThis is a great state,\u201d said Trump. \u201cWe are going to win this state.\u201d\n\nWhile the energy inside the arena was electric with Trump supporters cheering and waving signs, it was unclear what a prolonged impeachment drama might do to Trump\u2019s level of support.\n\nOpinion polls show an increasing number of Americans think he should be impeached, but his Republican base has largely stuck by his side.\n\nOutside the arena on a rainy night, thousands of protesters lined the streets, many holding signs calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment or calling for him to be locked up. The crowds broke out in chants of \u201clock him\u201d and \u201cimpeach him.\u201d\n\nOne protester, geologist Aubrey Lee, 36, said Trump needs to be impeached because he does not represent America\u2019s values anymore, from national security to equal rights.\n\n\u201cI am ecstatic about the impeachment inquiry and can\u2019t wait to see him impeached. It\u2019s long overdue,\u201d Lee said.\n\nTrump\u2019s path to re-election depends on clinching a cluster of farm and Rust Belt states decided by slim margins in 2016, including Minnesota.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nTrump\u2019s visit generated local backlash. The city\u2019s mayor was criticized for initially suggesting Trump was not welcome. The Minneapolis police union began selling pro-Trump T-shirts after the police chief said off-duty officers could not wear their uniforms to political events.\n\nNo Republican presidential candidate has won Minnesota since Richard Nixon in 1972.\n\nA poll released by Alliance for a Better Minnesota on Wednesday showed 52% of registered voters in the state would vote for the Democratic candidate next year, while 42% would vote for Trump. The survey of 1,175 voters was conducted with the left-leaning Public Policy Polling.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday used a campaign rally to blast the impeachment inquiry against him as a brazen attempt by Democrats to overthrow him, vowing the attempt to remove him from office would backfire.", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Jarrett Renshaw", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439503833&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A03G", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
