She\u2019s now in a wheelchair and probably will be for at least the next six weeks.\n\n\u201cThe first thing she was concerned about as she sat in resus was her attendance record as up until half-term she had 100%.\n\n\u201cAlexis is very determined \u2013 she\u2019s desperate to get back to school. Actually, the school has been very good; she\u2019s got work to do at home.\u201d\n\nNow back at Treliske, her family hope Alexis will be back at home in Redruth with her sister Elyssa, 8, and brother Logan, 4, by the end of the week, reports Cornwall Live .\n\nChris said: \u201cShe wants to go to trick or treating on Halloween like we always do, so I\u2019ll be pushing her around in the wheelchair.\u201d\n\nAlexis is determined to return to her much-loved hobby too \u2013 diving. The talented youngster trains at Plymouth Diving Centre once a week and \u201cwants to be the next Tom Daley\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s typical of Alex that she wants to run before she can walk,\u201d he added.\n\nChris, who manages a retail shop in Penzance, rushed to Treliske when he was told about the accident by his mother-in-law.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know the extent of her injuries. When I got to the hospital, I realised it was a bit more than a bump on the head.\u201d\n\nHe travelled to Bristol with his daughter in the helicopter, which Alexis thought was \u201ccool\u201d.\n\nA GoFundMe page set up by a friend of Alexis\u2019 mum Steff has now been disabled as it reached \u00a32,500, a figure beyond the target amount. The money will be spent on the 11-year-old\u2019s recovery.\n\nChris added: \u201cI\u2019d like to thank the staff at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, Treliske Hospital and the Coastguard. It was so slick and smooth from the time of the accident to the point of her operation.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t want to comment on the collision as he has yet to speak to the police about the incident, though he said it appeared to be a \u201cnatural accident\u201d.", "description": "Alexis Weatherley has to undergo two operations after she was in a collision with a car when she crossed a road in Redruth, Cornwall, on Monday, October 21", "authors": ["Lee Trewhela"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20745846.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Alexis-Weatherley.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
