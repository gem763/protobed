His first career no-no came against the Milwaukee Brewers in 2007.\n\nThe 36-year-old was especially impressive in this one, allowing only the second hitter of the game to reach base before mowing down the rest of the order.\n\nEvery Toronto batter besides Vladimir Guerrero Jr. struck out at least once, and five players struck out multiple times.\n\nThose watching along were impressed by the performance:\n\nVerlander also put himself in rare territory:\n\nOnly Nolan Ryan (seven) and Sandy Koufax (four) have thrown more no-hitters.\n\n\"No-hitters in general, they're magical,\" Verlander said in May, per David Barron of the Houston Chronicle. \"You come to the park and don't know what to expect. You have this build-up of anticipation, and when it happens, it's hard to explain the feeling of elation and the release of all the tension and energy.\"\n\nThe veteran has eight All-Star selections and a Cy Young Award already on his resume but has been as good as ever this season. He lowered his ERA to 2.56 after Sunday's effort, which leads the American League, while matching the major league high with 17 wins.\n\nA memorable showing like this one could be what he needs to seal another Cy Young Award in 2019.", "description": "Justin Verlander  completed the third no-hitter of his career with a dominant showing against the  Toronto Blue Jays .
