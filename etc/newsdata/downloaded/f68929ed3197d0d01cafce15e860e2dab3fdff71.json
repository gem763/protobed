These are defined as: \u201cAny fitting, material, appliance or apparatus to be fitted in a ship or other procedures, alternative fuel oils, or compliance methods used as an alternative to that required.\u201d\n\nIn statement to The Independent, the IMO said: \u201cThe intention behind that idea of equivalents is to allow for innovation.\u201d\n\nThough IMO member states have approved the use of open-loop scrubbers to meet the incoming sulphur cap, some regional ports have introduced rules to prevent their use.\n\nIn January, the UAE\u2019s Port of Fujairah announced a ban on the use of open-loop scrubbers in its waters.\n\nIn July, China said it would extend a ban scrubber discharges to cover all coastal regions within 12 nautical miles from China\u2019s territorial sea and regions near the southern island province of Hainan.\n\nAuthorities in Belgium, Germany, Ireland and the US have also implemented bans on scrubber discharge in some regions.\n\nIn May, EU member states made a submission to the IMO\u2019s Marine Environment Protection Committee calling for it to develop a set of \u201charmonised rules\u201d on the areas and conditions under which scrubbers can discharge.\n\nIn response, the committee appointed a team to assess the available evidence relating to the environmental impact of discharges from scrubbers. This team is due to present its findings in February 2020.\n\nIn a statement issued to The Independent, the IMO said it had already \u201cadopted strict criteria for discharge of washwater from exhaust gas cleaning systems\u201d.\n\nIt added that it is \u201cundertaking a review of the 2015 guidelines on exhaust gas cleaning systems. The guidelines include, among other things, washwater discharge standards.\u201d", "description": "Global shipping companies have spent millions\u00a0rigging vessels with \u201ccheat devices\u201d that circumvent new environmental legislation by dumping pollution into the sea instead of the air, The Independent can reveal.
