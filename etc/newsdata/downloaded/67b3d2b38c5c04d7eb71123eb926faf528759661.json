That sort of really hit home how big the standard of this tournament is going to be,\" Root said.\n\n\"You look at the players who came out in those first three rounds, the standard is going to be right up there.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images for ECB)\n\nAsked if it feels like a step up for domestic cricket, Root added: \"Yeah. And it's a good time for it as well, ahead of the twenty-20 World Cup.\n\n\"One thing it will do is give a platform for players to then showcase and go round the world and play in other domestic tournaments as well.\n\n\"It'll open doors, new relationships. Like these coaches are involved in IPL teams, Big Bash teams. It's taken shape nicely quite quickly.\"\n\nSeasoned professionals Dwight Gayle, Dwayne Bravo and Lasith Malinga were among those left on the scrap heap as the sides opted to go largely for young British talent.\n\nWith only three overseas players allowed per team, and just one player from the top reserve price band of \u00a3125,000, teams had to be strategic in their selections in order to get best value from their \u00a3960,000 budget.\n\nAnd England wicket-keeper Jos Buttler feels the focus on youth is particularly pleasing.\n\n\"I really like the fact that I think it means the teams are planning for the future,\" Buttler said.\n\n\"You look at our side, you\u2019ve got a lot of guys in their young 20\u2019s, so you can really build a franchise around these guys for the next five-ten years.\n\n\"I think it\u2019s fantastic to see these guys coming through.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images for ECB)\n\nFollowing its debut season, teams will be allowed to retain up to 10 of their original picks for the following year.\n\nButtler saw his Manchester Originals franchise snap up several promising youngsters, including Tom Abell and Phil Salt.\n\nSpeaking of the potential of the format, Buttler added: \"You\u2019re looking to engage current fans and new fans, and I think it does exactly that.\n\n\"A lot of it is building a brand of that franchise. I look at our side, young English talent, a team that could be together for a long time.\n\n\"Which looking at your investment as well, you're getting a guy now but what a player he might be in three, four, five years time, when you\u2019re trying to win it in its sixth edition.\"\n\nAustralian spin bowl legend Shane Warne is coach of London Spirit for the tournaments first installment, and was among the selectees who were given just 100 seconds between each pick to make their decision from a pool of 570 cricketers in the hat.\n\n\"I thought it was fascinating,\" Warne said. \"It was interesting to see how they [other coaches] thought of different people.\n\n(Image: Getty Images for The Hundred)\n\nWhen asked about the potential of the sport to take off, Warne was positive.\n\n\"I think you can start a culture,\" he said. \"This is going to go on for a long time hopefully, so its not just next year, the year after, building those sides as well. And everyone\u2019s got to try and get a following.\n\n\"We\u2019re very lucky at Lords, whatever game plays there gets sold out. So we wanted to make sure we have an entertaining brand of cricket that we played that\u2019ll excite the fans at a packed house stadium and we\u2019re going to have plenty of exciting players to watch. I think we\u2019ve managed to do that.\n\n\"And we\u2019ve got some guys who can bash it. And I think the hundreds going to be about bashing it.\"", "description": "Eight teams took their pick from a pool of 570 players to fill their squad ahead of next years competition", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Getty Images For Ecb", "Getty Images For The Hundred"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20665784.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_The-Hundred-Draft.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
