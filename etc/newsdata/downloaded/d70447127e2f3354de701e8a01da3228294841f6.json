But when most Americans consider their potential longevity, they're faced with a nagging concern: What happens if they last longer than their money?\n\nThis is actually a pretty big worry for many of us, with respondents to a recent survey by the financial services company Northwestern Mutual indicating that, on average, there's a 45% chance they'll outlive their savings. Yet despite fears about ending up a broke senior, 41% of respondents said they haven't taken any steps to address this concern.\n\nThere's a very real chance many people won't have enough money to support them through their later years -- especially as the same survey found 22% of Americans have under $5,000 saved for retirement and 15% have nothing saved at all.\n\nIf you're one of the millions worried your savings aren't sufficient, there are some steps you can take right now to try to make sure you have enough money to last.\n\nBinder labeled \"retirement savings plan\" with calculator and glasses sitting on it.

That's because you still have time to increase your contributions to your retirement savings account.\n\nWhile the traditional rule was that you should save around 10% of monthly income, this isn't really enough. Most people start saving too late to create a large enough nest egg if they put aside only 10% of income. And other factors -- such as more conservative estimates for investment returns, rising healthcare costs, and longer life spans -- also point to a need to save more than 10% of earnings.\n\nIf you don't want to worry that you'll outlive your savings, aim to save 20% of income for retirement. This is a lot of money, but would you rather sacrifice now or be left without funds when you're too old or sick to work?\n\nYou'll probably have to work up to saving 20% of what you earn. Some of the steps you can take to get there include:\n\nLiving on a budget that prioritizes saving for retirement.\n\nDiverting money from raises directly into your retirement accounts before you get a chance to spend the money.\n\nGradually increasing automatic contributions.\n\nIf you're contributing 10% of income today, move up to 12% and see if you can live on what's left over -- then keep inching up the contributions over time, and you may not notice much of a difference in your day-to-day life.\n\nKnow how much you can safely withdraw from your retirement accounts\n\nHow long your savings last depends on two big factors: How much you've saved and how quickly you take money out of your accounts.\n\nOne common rule of thumb, called the 4% rule, says you can withdraw 4% of your account balance in your first year of retirement and then increase your withdrawal rate to allow for inflation each year. So, a retiree with a $1 million portfolio could take out $40,000 in year one.\n\nUnfortunately, following the 4% rule isn't likely to make your savings last in today's world when returns are projected to be lower than in the past. The 4% rule also doesn't respond to changes in your investment portfolio's value if investments don't perform as expected. Instead, you should consider other approaches to determining a safe withdrawal rate.\n\nThe safest approach is to only take out investment gains and leave your principal balance alone. Unfortunately, this approach won't work for many people because they simply don't have enough gains to provide a reasonable income without withdrawing at least some invested funds.", "description": "Are you worried your money won't last as long as you do?", "authors": ["Christy Bieber", "The Motley Fool"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5KpOCHBWJjgeNLrt_UxC5w--~B/aD00Njg7dz03MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/motleyfool.com/f3560912b3e79b5b444cbad6193d5f3a", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
