Surprisingly, though, Google seems to have updated Recorder before it\u2019s even been released, with one particularly handy feature: automatic audio transcription.\n\nXDA Developers tested the new transcription feature, and it seems like it worked decently enough. The transcription of XDA Developers\u2019 test recording messed up the name of the speaker (Mishaal Rahman) and added a few too many periods, but it\u2019s still pretty readable:\n\nTypically, if you wanted to have an app automatically transcribe recordings, you\u2019d need to pay for a service like Otter.ai. Google\u2019s Recorder could be a nice alternative, especially if Google offers it for free.\n\nIn Recorder, it also appears you\u2019ll be able to search for a word within transcriptions and take you to where that word showed up in the recording. This could be an incredibly useful way to save yourself the trouble of painstakingly scrubbing through a recording to find that exact quote you\u2019re looking for:\n\n9to5Google also tested the updated app, and was able to find what appear to be Google\u2019s official Play Store images of Recorder as corroboration. They also show off another useful search feature: apparently, the app can automatically add time codes to sections of a recording, which could help you more easily find certain parts of your transcript:\n\nEven cooler? By digging through the app\u2019s code, XDA Developers found that you might be able to search for other types of \u201caudio events,\u201d including \u201capplause,\u201d \u201cbird,\u201d \u201ccat,\u201d \u201cdidgeridoo,\u201d \u201cdog,\u201d \u201cknock,\u201d \u201claughter,\u201d \u201cmusic,\u201d \u201crooster,\u201d \u201cspeech,\u201d \u201cphone,\u201d and \u201cwhistling.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, all of this transcription work is apparently being done on-device, as stated in a welcome screen XDA Developers shared, so Google probably isn\u2019t listening in to your recordings by storing them on its servers:\n\nSomewhat disappointingly, according to XDA Developers\u2019 analysis of the app\u2019s code, Recorder can only transcribe English for now, but perhaps other languages might be supported in the future.\n\nRecently, it seems Google has been investing a lot into live transcription, having shown off Live Transcribe, which automatically transcribes speech in near-real time, Live Caption, which captions spoken audio from apps on your phone, and the company\u2019s also automatically transcribing podcasts to better surface them in search results.\n\nHopefully Google shares more about Recorder at its October 15th event.", "description": "We already seem to know a lot about Google\u2019s upcoming Pixel 4, including one of its new apps: \"Recorder,\" a new voice recorder app. Surprisingly, Google seems to have updated Recorder before it\u2019s even released, and has apparently added what could be a handy feature: automatic audio transcriptions.", "authors": ["Jay Peters", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uaTxYPSYRQIf0TyIaCgQsFNztb8=/112x0:2500x1250/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19250871/google_recorder_audio_transcription_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
