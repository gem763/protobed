In a video from 2018, Gillis used racial slurs for Chinese people and also mocked Asian people who were trying to learn English.\n\nA spokesperson for SNL creator Lorne Michaels said Monday that Gillis \"will not be joining SNL\" and added, \"[w]e hired Shane on the strength of his talent as a comedian ... We were not aware of his prior remarks ... The language he used is offensive, hurtful and unacceptable.\"\n\nThe spokesperson went on to apologize that SNL didn't see the clips earlier and that its \"vetting process was not up to our standard.\"\n\nGillis would have joined the NBC show \u2014 now in its 45th season \u2014 along with new cast members Bowen Yang and Chloe Fineman. Yang is the broadcast's first Asian American performer who is openly gay. The show's season premiere is scheduled for September 28.\n\nGillis shared a statement about the videos late Thursday night, calling himself a \"comedian who pushes boundaries.\" While he didn't apologize in the statement, he said he would be \"happy to apologize to anyone who's actually offended\" by what he's said. He called the racist comments \"risks\" that missed the mark.\n\nShortly after SNL's announcement Monday, Gillis tweeted, \"I'm a comedian who was funny enough to get SNL. That can't be taken away.\" He added, \"I respect the decision they made. I'm honestly grateful for the opportunity.\"\n\nHe also quipped he was \"a mad tv guy anyway\" \u2014 in an apparent jab at SNL by supporting the show's one-time rival.\n\n2020 presidential candidate Andrew Yang to meet Shane Gillis\n\nAndrew Yang, a Democrat running for president in 2020, jumped into the controversy surrounding Shane Gillis over the weekend, offering to \"sit down and talk\" with the embattled comedian. Late Monday, Yang tweeted it appears that Gillis \"reached out\" to him and the two will meet at some point.\n\nYang, a Taiwanese-American, told CNN on Sunday that he has encountered racism in his upbringing, but noted \"our country has become excessively punitive and vindictive about remarks that people find offensive or racist.\"\n\n\"[Gillis] does not strike me as malignant or evil,\" Yang tweeted Saturday, adding, \"... if I can forgive Shane, as the guy he called a slur, I hope others can as well.\" At the time, Yang believed Gillis shouldn't lose his job and wrote: \"We are all human.\"\n\nWhat did Shane Gillis say?\n\nGillis was recorded in a video that went viral on Twitter in which he mocks Chinese people, using several racial slurs during an episode of his podcast last year.\n\nIn a now-deleted YouTube video, Gillis and his co-host, Matt McCusker, shared a slew of racist \"jokes\" against Chinese-Americans, mocking their accents and culture. The page for \"Matt and Shane's Secret Podcast\" is now completely devoid of content.\n\n\"Let the f**king c****s live there,\" Gillis said, referring to Manhattan's Chinatown neighborhood. The two go on to mock Chinatown's architecture and food, complaining extensively about MSG and calling noodles, \"nooders.\"\n\nIn the same video, Gillis and McCusker joke about going to Thailand to \"party with ladyboys\" and complain about other ethnicities being racist against white people.\n\nIn another podcast episode, the duo rank comedians by race, gender and sexuality. They repeatedly make sexist and racist remarks and use homophobic slurs throughout.\n\n\"White chicks are literally the bottom,\" Gillis said. \"Ali Wong is making it so Asian chicks are funnier than white chicks.\"\n\nThey also refer to Judd Apatow and Chris Gethard as \"white f****t comics\" and \"f**king gayer than ISIS.\"\n\nSophie Lewis contributed to this report.", "description": "A spokesperson for the show says Gillis \"will not be joining SNL\" and called the comedian's language \"offensive, hurtful and unacceptable\"", "authors": ["Peter Martinez"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/16/8ba9783c-d4e2-46e4-a59f-875e17e337ba/thumbnail/1200x630/2ed4338859c74ab6bcfac3f24bb6d14b/shane-gillis-podcast.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
