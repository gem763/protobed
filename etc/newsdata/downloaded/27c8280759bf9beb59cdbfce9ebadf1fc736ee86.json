League executives, in a vacuum, think he belongs in the league. When I\u2019ve talked to team sources about \u2018Melo, the general response is something like \u201che absolutely could still play in the league, he\u2019s just not a fit with us.\u201d Team executives have concerns about his willingness to accept a bench role and his midrange-heavy game.\n\nHowever, it may be his defensive issues that have him on the sidelines entering this NBA season (and maybe for the rest of his career).\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBaxter Holmes of ESPN did some fantastic reporting talking to Rockets and other executives about Anthony and the issues often came back to defense.\n\nOne rival front-office executive notes that the league\u2019s 3-point revolution makes it harder than ever to hide players who aren\u2019t strong defenders. He\u2019s talking about Carmelo Anthony \u2014 someone, he says, \u201cwho can\u2019t defend, can\u2019t close out, his feet are slow and he gets blown by.\u201d More than ever, offensive teams will repeatedly target weak defenders in pick-and-roll actions, the executive adds\u2026 Although the Rockets knew of Anthony\u2019s defensive weaknesses before he joined, team sources say they didn\u2019t anticipate just how limited he would be in their aggressive switch-centric defense, which tasked him with running quicker players off the 3-point line. One team source speculates that, had they known he\u2019d struggle so much in their defense, Anthony wouldn\u2019t have been brought aboard. \u201cHe really, really struggled with it,\u201d the source says.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnthony\u2019s defensive woes were most evident in a 2017 playoff series against Utah, when the Jazz dragged him into every pick-and-roll they could, and in the end the Thunder were 29.4 points per 100 possessions better when Anthony sat vs. when he played (stats via NBA.com). By the end, Anthony sat a lot.\n\nThat defense is a concern for a team that is going to give Anthony critical or heavy minutes.\n\nHowever, if he\u2019s willing to accept a bench role that will likely not see him in games at the end, the defensive issues are less of a problem. If Anthony is just on the court for 15 minutes a night and is tasked with just getting buckets (pair him with better defenders), he can help a team. The fit just has to be right, and as the season starts some team or teams will realize they could use a guy like Anthony off the bench.\n\nIn a league where Dwight Howard gets one last chance to play a role, Anthony deserves a chance, too.", "description": "In a league where Dwight Howard gets one last chance to play a role, Anthony deserves that chance, too.", "authors": ["Kurt Helin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/k0lud_sqVbWdfG45m9YrKQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjAuNDcxNTEyNzcwMTM3Ng--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/de6cazOGjf1QgR8OQImTsg--~B/aD01NzM7dz0xMDE4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/da2ee0981e05fa7e7c6a00832798bdbf", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
