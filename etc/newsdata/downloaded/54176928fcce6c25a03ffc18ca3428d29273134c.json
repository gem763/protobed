(\u201cThere is a type\u2014the male virgin\u2014lots of them in England,\u201d she complained. Also, the weather was bad.) When she left \u201cboring Oxford\u201d in 1957, first for France, then for New York, she embarked on the most productive period of her life. New Left publications like The New York Review of Books and The Partisan Review championed her. In 1963, she published her first novel, The Benefactor, and one year later \u201cNotes on \u2018Camp,\u2019 \u201d a list of playful, exhilarating observations about camp as a sensibility, and its \u201clove of the unnatural: of artifice and exaggeration.\u201d The essay landed her in Time magazine, where she was identified as \u201cone of Manhattan\u2019s brightest young intellectuals,\u201d transforming her from a mere essayist into \u201ca midcult commodity,\u201d according to Nora Ephron. \u201cNotes on \u2018Camp\u2019 \u201d was followed, in rapid succession, by Against Interpretation (1966), Death Kit (1967), and Styles of Radical Will (1969), all published before her 37th birthday.\n\nBut the more Sontag wrote, the more she fretted about writing. Periods of intense productivity were interspersed with periods of \u201clacerating insecurities,\u201d Moser writes. After expressing disdain for the \u201cexclusiveness, the possessiveness of marriage,\u201d she spent the 1960s and \u201970s in a series of devastating entanglements with women: a downtown party girl, a European duchess, a modern dancer, a filmmaker. \u201cThere is something Olympian about her sex life,\u201d Moser opines. \u201cHow many American women of her generation had lovers, male and female, as numerous, beautiful, and prominent?\u201d Her affairs left her in childlike states of bewilderment, shattered and sleepless. Overly possessive of her son, she \u201cgroomed him as a companion,\u201d clutching David closer than a mother should. As she entered her 40s, her friends \u201cremarked that she was even more than usually insensitive to others, more prone to fabrication.\u201d\n\nYet Sontag\u2019s lack of awareness and her insecurity were almost never on public display\u2014not when, at 42, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, not when chemotherapy turned her hair white. She dyed all but a front shock black and finished two books during her treatments: On Photography and Illness as Metaphor (1978), the latter of which railed against psychological accounts of cancer as a disease of \u201crepression\u201d without ever mentioning her cancer. Her illness prompted her to reevaluate her youthful leftism. She broke with the New Left in 1982, at a Town Hall event where she denounced communism, flanked by one of the great loves of her life, the morose Soviet dissident Joseph Brodsky. \u201cShe became a liberal,\u201d Moser writes, and as she entered her 50s, the pace of her writing slowed. Intermittently estranged from her son, who was installed as her editor at Farrar, Straus and Giroux, she did not produce another book, aside from a collection of essays, until AIDS and Its Metaphors, in 1989. She finished it as she tended to a friend dying of AIDS.", "description": "Her beauty and celebrity eclipse the real source of her allure\u2014her commitment to aesthetic self-discipline.", "authors": ["Merve Emre", "Benjamin Moser"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2019/09/CULT_Emre_Sontag_lg/facebook.jpg?1567787688", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
