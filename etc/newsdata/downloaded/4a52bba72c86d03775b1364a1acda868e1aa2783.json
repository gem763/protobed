of protestors when their demonstrations began in March, it is unlikely the move will deter further conflict.\n\nThe goals of the movement have shifted since the first protests in March to securing independence from China and the resignation of Ms Lam. Action is frequently accompanied by the chant \"five demands, not one less\", in reference to the possible removal of the bill.\n\n\"There aren't any big differences between suspension and withdrawal of the extradition bill... It's too little, too late,\" said 27-year-old protester Connie, hours before the withdrawal. \"There are still other demands the government needs to meet, especially the problem of police brutality.\"\n\nThe move comes amid reports China will seek to replace Ms Lam with an interim chief executive for the province in an attempt to quell protests.\n\nCiting people briefed on the deliberations, the Financial Times reported that, if given the blessing of Beijing's Xi Jinping, a successor to Ms Lam could be installed in March to see out the remained of her term, which is due to end in 2022.\n\nChinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying has since said the plans were a political rumour with ulterior motives.", "description": "The Hong\u00a0Kong\u00a0legislature has formally withdrawn the unpopular extradition bill that sparked a months-long protest movement.
