REUTERS/Carlos Jasso\n\nDonning gloves and surgical masks, half a dozen people stood by as an earthmover extracted heaps of dirt, with colorful pieces of trash gleaming in the sun, part of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\u2019s pledge to reveal what happened to the students.\n\nA few dozen armed soldiers were on guard scattered around the site, which was largely overgrown with trees and shrubs. A ribbon of yellow caution tape stamped with the words \u201cCriminal Prosecution\u201d and a barbed wire fence prevented onlookers from drawing any closer than the entry gate.\n\nThe dump is one of the latest fronts in a search that has produced more questions than answers since the students vanished on the night of Sept. 26, 2014, sparking international outrage and doing lasting damage to the administration of Mexico\u2019s then-president, Enrique Pena Nieto.\n\nThe government has given no details so far on what has been found at the site, but after pacing muddy dirt trails wearing a surgical mask, Mexico\u2019s deputy interior minister, Alejandro Encinas, on Friday afternoon hinted that it would prove significant.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve now realized this is an important site, a very important site,\u201d Encinas, the official in charge of human rights, said as he got into his car, without elaborating.\n\nThe Mexican public has grown accustomed to false starts and dead ends. Indeed, authorities said last week that the investigation had been so plagued with errors that they would be virtually starting from scratch.\n\nLocated in Tepecoacuilco, a few miles from the southwestern city of Iguala where the students were abducted, the dump is one of dozens of sites within five municipalities that officials have searched in recent weeks, Encinas said on Thursday, wearing a T-shirt stamped with the number \u201c43\u201d in remembrance of the students.\n\nIn a grim reminder of the prevalence of unmarked graves in the violent southwestern state of Guerrero, authorities have found 184 bodies so far, Encinas said, but none belonged to the missing students.\n\nAccording to the Pena Nieto administration, local drug gang Guerreros Unidos mistook the students for members of a rival outfit, killed them, incinerated their bodies in another nearby dump and tipped their remains into a river.\n\nHowever, the remains of only one of the 43 were ever definitively identified. A group of independent experts later picked several holes in the official version of events presented in 2015.\n\nIn the nearby town of Huitzuco, site of another probe that Encinas said is ongoing, Marco Moyo said he was heartened to see investigators taking new tacks in the search.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to see them looking in different places where they hadn\u2019t looked before,\u201d said Moyo, a 30-year-old student. \u201cThey could probably find different clues.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, he said he feels that the sense of anger around the students\u2019 disappearance is fading with each passing year. And such disappearances have some become so commonplace in Mexico that many other cases are all but an afterthought.\n\n\u201cThere are too many of them,\u201d Moyo said. \u201cAuthorities don\u2019t devote time to investigating them, and there isn\u2019t interest in investigating either.\u201d", "description": "Beside a one-lane highway in southwestern Mexico, surrounded by green fields and wildflowers, investigators combed a dump on Friday for any trace of 43 student teachers whose disappearance has haunted the country for five years.", "authors": ["Daina Beth Solomon", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434718748&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R00A", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
