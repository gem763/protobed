On Monday, Trump administration officials said policing could play a role in ameliorating the crisis, though they eschewed details on what that could look like.\n\nMayors denounced the administration for stressing enforcement rather than augmented spending. Sen. Kamala Harris denounced the White House\u2019s effort to\u201d enlist the help of law enforcement to address homelessness\u201d in California as \u201ccounterproductive.\u201d Protesters in San Francisco greeted Carson with chants of \u201chouse keys, not handcuffs.\u201d\n\nBut Carson, after touring a San Francisco housing facility that received federal assistance, told reporters that \u201cNo one\u2019s forcing homeless people into federal facilities.\u201d Pressed for detail on what types of changes to law enforcement practices might help, Carson suggested that local elected officials stop letting police officers be \u201cdemonized.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe local government should back the police up,\u201d Carson said, adding that \u201cpeople can make it very clear without having a big policy change whether they support law enforcement.\u201d\n\nThe secretary\u2019s response underscored a central dynamic of homelessness: cities and counties tend to shoulder a great share of the responsibility for both policing and housing policies that can affect how many people have homes.\n\nPressed on that point, Carson said the federal government\u2019s role could be cooperating with state and local governments, particularly by enlisting nonprofit and for-profit housing organizations.\n\n\u201cFederal government is designed to facilitate, not to solve all the problems\u2026cities and localities are the ones who solve the problems. The federal government supports them in doing that,\u201d he said, suggesting that federal money should be attached to the \u201cability to work together.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom had made a specific request for federal aid, writing Carson to allocate 50,000 more housing vouchers and increase their value. Carson told reporters that cities and states should instead be working with the federal government to claim vouchers that remain available.\n\nBut Carson did point to specific local decisions that have worsened a housing shortfall, including overregulation, a \u201cnot in my backyard\u201d attitude against publicly supported housing and the \u201cerroneous thinking\u201d of landlords resistant to tenants who receive housing vouchers. He also embraced an idea increasingly advocated by California elected officials: \"by-right\" zoning, removes some local barriers to new projects.\n\n\u201cIn San Francisco a single individual can protest and stop an affordable housing development. That\u2019s a big one,\u201d Carson said.", "description": "Pressed for detail on what types of changes to law enforcement practices might help, Ben Carson suggested that local elected officials stop letting police officers be \u201cdemonized.\u201d", "authors": ["Jeremy B.
