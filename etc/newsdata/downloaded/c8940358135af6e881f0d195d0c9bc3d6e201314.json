No more. We need to manage her. I have a responsibility to do that and England have a responsibility to do that, too.'\n\nToni Duggan, one of 17 players named that helped steer the Lionesses to the World Cup semi-final in France this summer, also makes a return to the senior international fold. Neville finally conceded during his press conference that the Atletico Madrid forward suffered an injury ahead of the tournament, hence her contributions falling short of expectations.\n\nHe said: 'She had a big set-back in the summer. We rushed her back from an injury that she got on the first day of training in France.\n\n'I've seen her play over the last two or three weeks and she looks like she's getting that sparkle in her eyes. She's getting her mojo back and that's why she's earnt the right to come back into the squad. She's a big player for us when she's 100 per cent fit and she knows that.'\n\nManchester City teenager Lauren Hemp, who made her senior debut in England's narrow 1-0 win over Portugal after being drafted in for the injured Jill Scott, has earned her first full call up.\n\nThe 19-year-old's City team-mates Ellen White, Georgia Stanway and Gemma Bonner will also join the Lionesses at St George's Park when the squad meet next week but Neville admitted he will continue to assess White and Stanway's fitness before making a decision on their involvement.\n\nEngland will travel to the Czech Republic four days after the home tie against Germany for their final international fixture of the year.", "description": "Neville named a 21-strong squad on Tuesday morning which is set to meet up at the Lionesses' St George's Park base next week in preparation for the sell-out friendly against Germany.", "authors": ["Claire Bloomfield For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/11/20323188-0-image-a-37_1572350328131.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
