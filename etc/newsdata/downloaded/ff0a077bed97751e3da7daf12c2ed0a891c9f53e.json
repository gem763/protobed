Trump\u2019s campaign, because of its partnership with the RNC and state Republican parties, is able to bring in much more from a single donor than the $5,600 haul Democrats can take in.\n\nThat will change when Democrats settle on a nominee. But the party\u2019s operatives are worried the Trump campaign will be able to exploit their cash advantage in the coming months, when the Democratic field is squabbling among itself, to damage a potential nominee before they can make a general election pitch.\n\nA multimillion-dollar ad buy from the Trump campaign that started last week is helping cement those fears, even as operatives remain skeptical it will deal much damage to former Vice President Joe Biden, its intended target.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at what is at disposal, you see a massive campaign war chest, a right-wing media infrastructure and a White House that he has increasingly weaponized,\u201d said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist who worked for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. \u201cPut those all together, and he has the capacity to run the biggest propaganda and disinformation campaign in American history. That\u2019s the real fear.\u201d\n\nAdding to the problem: a host of Democratic donors and groups who have promised to spend big on the general election have so far done little to attack Trump before the Democratic nominee is settled. Democrats believe the president, who trails the leading Democratic candidates in way-too-early public opinion polling, is vulnerable on a host of issues, especially health care and the perception Trump does more to help the wealthy than the middle class.\n\nWe need to be starting to make the case against Trump on the economy, health care and immigration now ... so our nominee isn\u2019t starting from scratch. Eddie Vale, Democratic strategist\n\n\u201cIt is good that there are a lot of progressive organizations who are starting to make plans for ad and field funding for the general election, but we can\u2019t entirely cede the battle to Trump in the meantime and need to be hitting him now,\u201d said Eddie Vale, a Democratic strategist who previously worked for labor unions. \u201cWe need to be starting to make the case against Trump on the economy, health care and immigration now \u2014 like Priorities USA is doing \u2014 especially in the states, so our nominee isn\u2019t starting from scratch after Trump having months of spending domination.\u201d\n\nAnother Democratic strategist, who requested anonymity to criticize powerful groups within the party, was blunter: \u201cThere are a number of groups that have made grandiose promises to what they\u2019re going to do counter Trump while we\u2019re in the primary. So far, most of them haven\u2019t done more than send their press release.\u201d\n\nSo far, Priorities USA, the party\u2019s biggest super PAC, has spent $2.5 million on digital ads attacking Trump and promoting voter registration, with much of the spending focused on the four states strategists in both parties see as key to Trump\u2019s reelection chances: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida. The group spent over $190 million on the 2016 election, and plans to spend $100 million before a nominee is selected this time around.\n\nBut other potential big spenders have been quiet. Democratic operatives have said former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg would spend at least $500 million to defeat Trump. Right now, he has no immediate spending plans. Future Majority, a nonprofit with goals to spend $60 million to improve the Democratic Party\u2019s brand in key swing states, has spent a fraction of that so far. American Bridge aims to spend $50 million to help Democrats keep down Trump\u2019s margin among rural voters, but little has gone out the door so far.\n\nThe Trump campaign launched a $10 million ad buy attacking Biden over unsubstantiated allegations he sought his son\u2019s business interests in Ukraine, and attempting to defend Trump for allegations he withheld military aid from the Ukranian government to pressure them to reopen an investigation into Biden. (The latter is now the subject of the U.S. House\u2019s impeachment inquiry.)\n\nThe campaign has begun airing the ads in the first four voting states in the Democratic 2020 presidential primary process \u2015 Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina \u2015 in an apparent attempt to damage Biden\u2019s chances of winning the nomination.\n\n\u201cThey lost the election, now they want to steal this one,\u201d the narrator says in one of Trump\u2019s ads.\n\nThe Biden campaign and other strategists downplayed the direct impact of the buy. Biden allies think there is little chance the ad \u2014 which includes the disclaimer the Trump campaign is funding it \u2014 would sway Democratic primary voters who loathe the president. And Democratic strategists also questioned how well-targeted the ad was. It included a national cable television buy, which is usually associated more with attempts to change the media narrative around an event than with winning over swing voters.\n\n\u201cThe Trump campaign and the RNC have essentially unlimited funding to do whatever they want to do,\u201d said Mark Riddle, the executive director of Future Majority. \u201cBut the real question is whether or not he\u2019s breaking through to anyone beyond his base.\u201d\n\nRiddle said he isn\u2019t as worried about Trump\u2019s ad buy as other Democrats, but acknowledges the party might need to respond if Trump\u2019s approval ratings move up or support for an impeachment inquiry declines.\n\n\u201cIf we start seeing Trump\u2019s numbers going up, and his narrative is taking hold, then it might be time to shift something,\u201d Riddle said.\n\nAmanda Terkel contributed reporting.", "description": "Democrats think the president\u2019s reelection campaign is wasting money, but are worried about just how much money the president can afford to waste.", "authors": ["Senior Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9cfe17200000d5054fa709.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
