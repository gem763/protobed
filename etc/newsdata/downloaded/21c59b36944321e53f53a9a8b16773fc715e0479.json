Now he really is on his own.\n\nFighting along the border is limited, so far, but that could quickly change. \u201cShould hostilities intensify, a broader Turkish advance into densely populated areas could entail significant civilian casualties, displace many inhabitants and fuel local insurgency,\u201d the International Crisis Group warned.\n\nEven as the EU, the US, Russia, Iran and the Arab states voice their differing objections to the invasion (Turkey terms it a \u201cpeace operation\u201d), each is simultaneously trying to adjust to it, looking for advantage or leverage as the balance of power in Syria shifts again.\n\nErdo\u011fan doubtless anticipated Europe\u2019s hostile reaction. His response \u2013 a threat to send 3.6 million Syrian refugees westwards \u2013 was contemptuous. He knows the EU\u2019s words are not matched by action. Nor is he fazed by calls to suspend Turkey from Nato.\n\nTurkey\u2019s relations with Europe were already at a low ebb because of its abysmal human rights record and thwarted EU membership bid. Now European leaders are paying a high price for past attempts to normalise Erdo\u011fan\u2019s authoritarianism. His latest actions prove he is no democrat, no ally and no friend.\n\nWhile Europe has scant influence over what happens next, the US has plenty \u2013 but seems determined to throw it away. Despite denials, it is clear from the White House statement issued on 6 October that Donald Trump rashly agreed to Erdo\u011fan\u2019s invasion, without consulting his allies, and facilitated it by withdrawing ground forces.\n\nIt was a disastrous decision the US is belatedly scrambling to correct. Betraying the Kurds, comrades-in-arms in the fight against Isis, was bad enough. Appearing to abandon Syria to Russia and Iran, America\u2019s rivals and the main backers of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s criminal Damascus regime, was a big strategic own goal, capping eight years of post-Arab spring US policy failures.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.

Yet Moscow\u2019s reaction to the invasion has been largely negative, as was the case after Turkey intervened in Syria\u2019s Idlib province last year.\n\nWhen Vladimir Putin sent forces to Syria in 2015, he put his money on Assad to win, but victory has proved elusive, while costs \u2013 political and financial \u2013 have mounted. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s move further complicates matters by obstructing the peace settlement Russia, Iran (and Turkey) have been pursuing via the so-called Astana process.\n\nThat\u2019s why Russia is urging the Kurds, now the US has abandoned them, to agree a mutual defence pact or some kind of federal arrangement with Assad. And that\u2019s why regime forces and pro-Iran militia are edging towards Kurdish-held areas from the south. Assad sees a chance to recapture lost territory. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s fatuous \u201csafe zone\u201d wheeze has no appeal for him.\n\nIran is not happy either, but for different reasons. It, too, wants to see the back of the Americans and has no love for the Kurds, a troublesome minority inside Iran. But Turkey\u2019s move threatens Tehran\u2019s hopes of controlling a northern territorial corridor linking it with its Shia allies in Lebanon \u2013 what Israel calls a \u201ccorridor of terror\u201d.\n\nAfter struggling to establish a pro-Tehran, Shia-dominated government in post-2003 Baghdad, Iran does not want to face another Sunni uprising across Syria and Iraq.\n\n\u201cThe US withdrawal will kindle fears in Iran of a galvanised Sunni insurgency through a renascent Islamic State (Isis),\u201d wrote regional analyst Bilal Baloch.\n\nWorries about an Isis revival, considered more likely thanks to Turkey\u2019s move, are common to all the regional players. Strangely, in this respect at least, the US, Iran and Saudi Arabia, on the brink of war a few weeks ago, now find themselves on the same side.\n\nArab governments including Egypt, Jordan, Bahrain, Lebanon and the UAE, as well as the Saudis, have all condemned Turkey. After initially backing Syria\u2019s rebels, several have pursued a cautious rapprochement with Assad in recent months, based on a shared interest in regional stability and upholding the principle of territorial sovereignty.\n\nArab leaders also object to Erdo\u011fan\u2019s support for the Muslim Brotherhood and his neo-Ottoman ideas about Turkish regional dominance. Like Russia and Iran, they calculate, reluctantly but pragmatically, that the only way to end Syria\u2019s war, and contain Isis, is to back Assad. Erdo\u011fan has now got in the way.\n\nThe crisis has produced another cautionary lesson: that American alliances cannot be trusted. The Kurds already knew this. They were betrayed in Iraq in 1991, when the US left Saddam Hussein in power at the end of the first Gulf war.\n\nBut US unreliability is new for the Saudi regime which, like Israel, ultimately depends on Washington for its security. The more the Saudis realise they cannot count on America, the more likely they are to mend fences with Iran. By some accounts, this is already happening.\n\nHow ironic if Trump\u2019s Syrian cop-out \u2013 providing a reality check about the limits of American power \u2013 led indirectly to peace in the Gulf, an end to the Iran-Saudi proxy war in Yemen, and spiked the guns of US and Israeli hawks who have pushed so hard for war with Tehran.", "description": "Turkey\u2019s Syria invasion following US withdrawal of its troops means that all bets are now off in the Middle East", "authors": ["Simon Tisdall"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2dabc1bfd45cf9e2a88e5075f2f3644c460bbfde/0_274_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=eb29c1ec7989cdca49ae87238365c0e7", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
