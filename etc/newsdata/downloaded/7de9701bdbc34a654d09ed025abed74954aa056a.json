That would immediately push up the cost of debt \u2013 and would quickly require an increase in interest rates, rising the price of everything from credit card debt to home loans.\n\nFuel, food, and imported consumer goods will become more expensive.\n\nThe worsening state of government finances will make the rand vulnerable, and a weaker rand can have a dramatic impact on the cost of fuel and food, among other items dependent on imports or global prices.\n\nA weaker rand will increase the price of maize, which will have an impact on the price of numerous foodstuffs from mielie meal to meat. South Africa is a major importer of wheat, so a weaker rand will also increase bread prices.\n\nOther products that would be hit include chocolate, cell phones \u2013 and foreign holidays too, for those who can still afford them.\n\nElectricity prices will go even higher.\n\nEskom has been burning billions of rands in imported diesel to try and avoid load shedding.\n\nAt the end of July, Eskom reported that the group and independent power producers had spent R6.5 billion on diesel-generated power in the year ended March.\n\nThat doesn't get cheaper when the rand weakens, and ultimately Eskom recovers that money from consumers.\n\nThere will be even fewer jobs.\n\nWhatever mechanism is used to plug the revenue shortfall will hit consumer confidence and business confidence, both of which are at the heart of economic growth. Nobody wants to invest when things are getting worse.\n\nThe impact of even lower growth will not be a decrease in the already sky-high unemployment \u2013 not as companies cut costs and consumers hit by higher taxes and other costs hang on to their money more tightly.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The failure to collect enough tax is going to haunt consumers in coming years.
