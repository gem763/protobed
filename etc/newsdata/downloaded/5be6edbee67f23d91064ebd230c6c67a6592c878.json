With seven goals already, he has justified Brentford\u2019s decision to reinvent him as a striker.\n\n\u201cIt was a top performance from Ollie,\u201d said manager Thomas Frank, who had joked he would give Watkins five out of 10 for his display. \u201cI think the way he converted himself into a No. 9 from a No. 10 is impressive.\u201d\n\nWatkins decided an unexpectedly entertaining game. As Barnsley\u2019s winless run extended to nine games, Brentford won the battle of the sides who kicked off as the lowest scorers in the Championship. The floodgates opened for both amid the incessant rain of Oakwell.\n\nPerhaps it never rains but it pours as Barnsley ended a drought that dated back to August while Brentford found the net on the road for the first time in 50 days to quadruple their tally of away goals. Watkins has got all four. Brentford\u2019s problem is that the rest of their squad only have a solitary strike at Griffin Park between them.\n\nThey had to come from behind in a rare game to feature a goal in the first minute of each half. Cauley Woodrow curled in a 25-yard shot to become Barnsley\u2019s top scorer, albeit with just two.\n\nBut the more potent Watkins responded. First, when unmarked, he headed in Mathias Jensen\u2019s inviting cross before he capitalised from a yard when Barnsley goalkeeper Brad Collins misjudged and missed Sergi Canos\u2019 deep centre. \u201cAll the best strikers score goals in the six-yard box,\u201d Frank added.\n\nStory continues\n\nWatkins completed his first hat-trick since 2016 from another Canos cross. Collins got a hand to his header but it still trickled over the line. \u201cI don't think I've scored three headers in a season, let alone one game, so I will take that,\u201d said Watkins. He could have completed his treble earlier: in an extraordinary few seconds, he had hit the post and bar while the profligate Said Benrahma then shot wide of an empty net.\n\nMeanwhile Barnsley could rue a similar miss from Conor Chaplin when they led. \u201cDefeat is hard to accept,\u201d said manager Daniel Stendel. \u201cIf I am a Barnsley supporter, I am not happy today.\u201d\n\nMatch details\n\nBarnsley (4-4-2): Collins; Cavare (Thiam 74), Anderson, Halme, Williams; Brown, Sibbick, Mowatt, Thomas (Wilks 63); Chaplin (Schmidt 63), Woodrow.\n\nSubstitutes: Walton (g), Green, Styles, Pinillos.\n\nBrentford (4-3-3): Raya; Dalsgaard, Jansson, Jeanvier, Henry; Jensen (Dasilva 85), Norgaard, Mokotjo; Canos (Pinnock 79), Watkins (Karelis 88), Benrahma.\n\nSubstitutes:Daniels (g), Mbuemo, Clarke, Zamburek.\n\nReferee: David Webb (County Durham)\n\nAttendance: 12,188", "description": "As Ollie Watkins celebrated a headed hat-trick to install himself as the Championship\u2019s top scorer, it was safe to say Brentford managed to replace Neal Maupay without spending a penny.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TNzbznTftp4uRmgiktoubQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/iKiToHhsCFLqV4T2JjNSeA--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/7d230136ae56f150167da2c1648052c5", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
