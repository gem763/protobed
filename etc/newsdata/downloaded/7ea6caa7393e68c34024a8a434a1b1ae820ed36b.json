(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cBULLSHIT\u201d is all over the place. Any child could have looked at a TV on Wednesday afternoon and seen the forbidden word superimposed across Wolf Blitzer\u2019s tie: \u201cSEETHING TRUMP ACCUSES REP. SCHIFF OF TREASON, DENOUNCES IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AS \u2018BULLSHIT.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe Washington Post published \u201cbullshit\u201d at least five times that day and obviously continues to do so. So did other news organizations as they reported on an especially angry and profane rant by President Trump.\n\nIf the word emanated from almost any other person, it would be considered not fit for repetition, let alone mass broadcast, under the puritanical standards of decency this country is supposedly based on. But because this particular instance of \u201cbullshit\u201d issued from the leader of the United States, it can and possibly even must be shared verbatim with the world.\n\n\u201cIt is newsworthy that he wrote it and tweeted it out, and we should show and say it because the president sent it out just that way,\u201d an internal CNN memo advised on Wednesday, according to the New York Times.\n\nBefore Trump\u2019s \u201cbullshit,\u201d there was his \u201cshithole countries,\u201d and before that, there was \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d \u2014 all disseminated and debated in public as if they were the names of tax bills. Not to mention Trump\u2019s rallies, where cusses fall from his mouth liberally. The Washington Post takes a cautious approach to profanity but decided early in the administration that the vulgar utterances of the president or his spokespeople should be reported in full.\n\nDemocrats are swearing, too, now, as if in retaliation. \u201cF-- me,\u201d Rep. Tim Ryan (Ohio) wrote in an Aug. 5 tweet about the president, who had just misidentified the site of a mass shooting. (Ryan left the vowel out, if that makes it any more decorous.)\n\nPresidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke routinely drops f-bombs when he talks about gun violence, and his campaign sells T-shirts quoting his curses. Cory Booker\u2019s campaign manager tweeted a screenshot of a text of Booker swearing about Trump, as if we needed to see it that badly.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee reportedly warned the candidates not to curse at last month\u2019s televised debate. Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg both said \u201cdamn\u201d anyway.\n\nThe Parents Television Council, which historically has been concerned with cleaning up Hollywood and Super Bowl halftime shows, is urging news broadcasters to be mindful of the words they quote when children might be watching.\n\n\u201cWe are also calling on our elected and appointed officials across the political spectrum to recognize the exemplary role they play for children and to tone down the profanity and to use smarter words,\u201d the council\u2019s president, Tim Winter, said in a statement to The Post. \u201cPerhaps our nation can use this sudden infatuation for harsh profanity as a learning moment and identify words that can more precisely identify our sentiments.\u201d\n\nPerhaps, but it feels more as if we\u2019re drifting toward the rhetorical hellscape imagined in the movie \u201cIdiocracy,\u201d in which President Camacho begins his State of the Union address: \u201cSh--. I know sh--\u2019s bad right now.\u201d\n\nColumbia University linguistics professor John McWhorter thinks our sweary public discourse reflects evolving standards of decency as much as the president\u2019s potty mouth.\n\n\u201cWhat genuinely registers as profane to most Americans is now slurs rather than references to bodily matters such as sex,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s natural that serious public figures will use the classic four-letter words ever more to signal authenticity. But Trump\u2019s unmonitored speech has mainstreamed such words in the media even faster of late, in that the urgency of reporting the appalling things he says requires that \u2018shithole country\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019m fucked\u2019 end up all over the news.\u201d\n\nNo other president has cursed like Trump: publicly, constantly and even somewhat creatively, as when he dubbed Rep. Adam B. Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, \u201clittle Adam Schitt.\u201d\n\nHis predecessors were hardly altar boys, but they tended to swear sparingly or exclusively in private. Abraham Lincoln liked to tell a joke about George Washington\u2019s effect on an Englishman\u2019s bowels. George W. Bush was once caught on a hot mic calling a reporter a \u201cmajor league asshole,\u201d and Barack Obama joked to the U.S. women\u2019s soccer team: \u201cPlaying like a girl means you\u2019re a badass. Perhaps I shouldn\u2019t have used that phrase.\u201d\n\nThe White House tapes that helped bring down Richard Nixon were full of curses and racial slurs, but it notably took congressional intervention and a subpoena before the public could hear any of them. Trump just gives his profanity away \u2014 freely seeding it across the cultural landscape.\n\n\u201cThis is very different. We\u2019re coming to a point where it\u2019s not unusual at all to hear politicians and TV hosts cursing,\u201d said Julian Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton University. \u201cIf the president is doing it, that becomes totally legitimate, totally normalized. There\u2019s no hot mic needed because they\u2019ll just do it right in your face.\u201d", "description": "Once-forbidden words are now showing up in the news \u2014 and in the utterances of his political rivals.", "authors": ["Avi Selk", "Avi Is A Features Writer For The Washington Post.
