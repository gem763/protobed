Back in 2016, Turkish forces intervened into Syrian civil war, targeting the US-backed Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) in the northern part of the country. They had made steadfast advances but stopped short of crossing Euphrates River.\n\nResponding to Erdogan\u2019s warning on Saturday, the Kurdish militias threatened \u201cto turn any unprovoked [Turkish] attack into an all-out war,\u201d Reuters reported.\n\nAlso on rt.com Erdogan accuses US of favoring \u2018terrorists\u2019 in Syria, says Turkey will set up safe zone on its own\n\nAnkara and Washington agreed earlier in August to create a safe area in northern Syria and establish a \u2018peace corridor\u2019 to facilitate the return of displaced Syrians. But actual progress has been slow on the ground as the US insisted on protecting and supporting its Kurdish allies in the zone, which Turkey considers terrorists.\n\nIn September, Erdogan suggested that Washington was after \u201ca safe zone in northern Syria not for Turkey but for the terrorist group.\u201d Turkish officials have accused the Americans of not doing enough to actually establish the zone, which could house numerous Syrians who fled the war since 2011.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
