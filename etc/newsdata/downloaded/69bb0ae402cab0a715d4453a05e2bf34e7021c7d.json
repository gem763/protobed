Subpoenas Scoop Up Personal Data From Scores of Companies", "language": "en", "text": "The F.B.I. has used secret subpoenas to obtain personal data from far more companies than previously disclosed, newly released documents show.\n\nThe requests, which the F.B.I. says are critical to its counterterrorism efforts, have raised privacy concerns for years but have been associated mainly with tech companies. Now, records show how far beyond Silicon Valley the practice extends \u2014 encompassing scores of banks, credit agencies, cellphone carriers and even universities.\n\nThe demands can scoop up a variety of information, including usernames, locations, IP addresses and records of purchases. They don\u2019t require a judge\u2019s approval and usually come with a gag order, leaving them shrouded in secrecy. Fewer than 20 entities, most of them tech companies, have ever revealed that they\u2019ve received the subpoenas, known as national security letters.\n\nThe documents, obtained by the Electronic Frontier Foundation through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit and shared with The New York Times, shed light on the scope of the demands \u2014 more than 120 companies and other entities were included in the filing \u2014 and raise questions about the effectiveness of a 2015 law that was intended to increase transparency around them.", "description": "The practice, which the bureau says is vital to counterterrorism efforts, casts a much wider net than previously disclosed, newly released documents show.", "authors": ["Jennifer Valentino-Devries"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/20/multimedia/20NSLs-02/20NSLs-02-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
