Ambassador Sondland traveled to Washington from Brussels in order to prepare for his testimony and to be available to answer the Committee\u2019s questions.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPresident Trump said on Twitter that he \u201cwould love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican\u2019s [sic] rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public to see.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and Democrats\u2019 point man on the impeachment inquiry, called the administration\u2019s efforts to block Sondland\u2019s deposition \u201cfurther acts of obstruction of a coequal branch of government.\u201d\n\nSchiff said that the committee had been discussing Sondland\u2019s deposition with the State Department\u2019s legal adviser as recently as Monday evening and \u201cthere was no indication that the ambassador would be a no-show.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSchiff said that Sondland, who remains a State Department employee, had turned over text messages and emails from a personal device to the department, communications that are \u201cequally relevant to this investigation and the impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nTrump referred to some of those communications, pointing to comments that Sondland had made to Ambassador William B. \u201cBill\u201d Taylor, the senior U.S. diplomat in Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cImportantly, Ambassador Sondland\u2019s tweet, which few report, stated, \u2018I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions. The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.\u2019 That says it ALL!\u201d the president said on Twitter.\n\nAD\n\nSondland made those comments in a text message, not a tweet, that was part of a trove of communications turned over to Congress last week by Kurt Volker, who resigned late last month as Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine.\n\nThe messages show Sondland and Volker worked together to shape U.S. foreign policy around Trump\u2019s desire to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, as well as an unsubstantiated theory that Ukraine had interfered in the 2016 presidential election to undermine Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\nDemocrats say the statement of Sondland\u2019s that Trump cited \u2014 \u201cno quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind\u201d \u2014 shows Sondland\u2019s effort to minimize political fallout from the administration\u2019s dealings with Ukrainian officials.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Sept. 9, Taylor had texted Sondland, \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d according to messages Volker provided to lawmakers last week.\n\nHours later, Sondland, who had been aggressively pursuing a public agreement for Ukraine to launch the investigations, replied that Taylor was incorrect and that there was no quid pro quo. He then sought to move the conversation to a phone call rather than written messages, the texts show.\n\nThe text messages show that Sondland, whose portfolio does not include U.S.-Ukraine relations, inserted himself into the effort to obtain a commitment from Ukraine to launch the investigations. At the time, the government in Kiev was eagerly awaiting the release of nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid and the arrangement of a face-to-face meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn one text message, Sondland wrote that Trump \u201creally wants the deliverable,\u201d referring to a clear demonstration from Ukraine that it would undertake the investigations.\n\nOfficials\u2019 texts reveal belief that Trump wanted probes as condition of Ukraine meeting\n\nThe State Department\u2019s move to block Sondland from appearing Tuesday drew swift condemnation from Democrats.\n\n\u201cThis is obstruction,\u201d tweeted Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.). \u201cSondland is a key witness to the President\u2019s attempts to seek campaign interference from Ukraine. The President is obviously terrified of what Sondland might tell Congress.\u201d\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) said the Trump administration\u2019s move showed \u201cconsciousness of guilt.\u201d\n\nHolding Ukraine hostage: How the president and his allies, chasing 2020 ammunition, fanned a political storm\n\nRepublicans supported the administration\u2019s decision to block Sondland\u2019s deposition and accused Democrats of trying to lead Volker to conclusions that were politically damaging to the president. GOP lawmakers have complained that Democrats didn\u2019t release all of his text messages, including ones they say show the administration wasn\u2019t pressuring Ukraine in exchange for aid and support.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe way [Schiff] treated Volker last week, that treatment is the reason why the State Department and the White House said we\u2019re not going to subject Ambassador Sondland to the same treatment,\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the ranking member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, told reporters. The committee is one of three investigating the president as part of the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Volker was not giving them the answers that they were leading Ambassador Volker to conclude,\u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), another of the president\u2019s allies on Capitol Hill. \u201cThis president did not hold aid to try to influence a foreign country to do anything.\u201d\n\nSondland, 61, appears never to have held a position in government before being named the ambassador to the E.U. in June 2018. He built his fortune acquiring and managing luxury hotels in the Pacific Northwest and gave $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund via shell companies that obscured his involvement.\n\nRachael Bade contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "Text messages show that Sondland, the ambassador to the E.U., was shaping U.S. foreign policy in Ukraine as Trump pressed for investigations of his political opponents.", "authors": ["Shane Harris", "Intelligence", "National Security Reporter", "Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives", "John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/1tvNz9X8p1eX-4A8uc8C4hEchVA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JHQB5GHJJII6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
