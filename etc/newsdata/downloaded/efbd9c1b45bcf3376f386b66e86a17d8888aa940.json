Apple says that a notification will appear on the affected iPhone\u2019s lock screen for 4 days after a problem is first detected, then it\u2019ll move to the main settings menu for 15 more days. After all that, it gets pushed away to Settings -> General -> About.\n\nAccording to Apple, this new measure only applies to its brand new iPhones and not previous models. Even if it can\u2019t be verified as genuine, the display isn\u2019t prevented from functioning normally by iOS.\n\nThis new screen verification warning follows another alert that Apple recently began showing customers when iPhones detect an unauthorized battery replacement. \u201cWe take the safety of our customers very seriously and want to make sure any battery replacement is done properly,\u201d an Apple spokesperson said about that notification, which was criticized by right to repair advocates because it also disables the iPhone\u2019s battery statistics and health data. \u201cThere are now over 1,800 Apple authorized service providers across the US so our customers have even more convenient access to quality repairs.\u201d Apple recently said it would make genuine parts available to more independent repair businesses.\n\nRaising a safety issue with batteries is perfectly reasonable; batteries can be dangerous. But should the company be this aggressive about swapped displays? On the other hand, this is a pretty direct way of alerting customers that they might\u2019ve been given a bum display by their local repair shop. And if you\u2019re buying a used iPhone 11 at some point in the future, there\u2019ll be no wondering whether the screen was replaced with a cheap, non-Apple part.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s an added element to this display notification that seems a little alarming, too. Apple makes it sound as if the iPhone might report back to the company that you\u2019re using a display that couldn\u2019t be verified and tie that information to the device\u2019s service history. This could potentially cause problems if you need to get something else on your iPhone fixed down the line.\n\nYou might see an additional notification that says, \u201cApple has updated the device information for this iPhone.\u201d This means that Apple has updated the device information maintained for your iPhone for service needs, safety analysis, and to improve future products.\n\nThe Verge has reached out to Apple for more details on these new display verification measures. The company recently introduced a subscription model for its AppleCare+ extended warranty, letting customers pay monthly even beyond the usual two-year window and maintain coverage for as long as Apple offers servicing for that device.", "description": "Apple has published a new support document that says the iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max will present customers with a warning if the devices are unable to verify a genuine display after a screen repair job.", "authors": ["Chris Welch", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kwIC2lPnlxARBQ70nlozXqnRgBo=/0x97:1448x855/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19232933/Screen_Shot_2019_09_25_at_6.08.01_PM.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
