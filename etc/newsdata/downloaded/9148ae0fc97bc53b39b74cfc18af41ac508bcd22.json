Mandatory Credit: Ron Chenoy-USA TODAY Sports\n\nESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter, citing league sources, tweeted that the MRI result was a \u201cbest-case scenario.\u201d That means a limited absence for the reigning league Most Valuable Player of \u201cabout three games,\u201d Schefter reported.\n\nMahomes, 24, entered the game playing on a tender left ankle he sprained in the season opener and aggravated several times, including Sunday in a home loss to the Houston Texans. After he exited Thursday with the Chiefs ahead 13-6, veteran backup Matt Moore completed Kansas City\u2019s 30-6 win over Denver.\n\nCoach Andy Reid confirmed that Moore would start the Chiefs\u2019 next game, on Oct. 27 at home against the Green Bay Packers.\n\n\u2014New York Giants star running back Saquon Barkley is slated to return from a high ankle sprain and play Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nBarkley missed the past three games due to the injury. He was not listed on Friday\u2019s injury report, nor was tight end Evan Engram (knee), who missed last week\u2019s Thursday night loss at New England.\n\n\u2014Arizona Cardinals general manager Steve Keim reiterated his desire against trading star cornerback Patrick Peterson on Friday. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt, in my opinion, he is the best in the National Football League and will remain a Cardinal,\u201d Keim said.\n\nA three-time All-Pro and eight-time Pro Bowl selection, Peterson returns to the Cardinals on Sunday after serving a six-game suspension for violating the NFL\u2019s performance-enhancing drug policy.\n\n\u2014New Orleans running back Alvin Kamara was ruled out of the Saints\u2019 Sunday game at Chicago with knee and ankle injuries. Kamara injured his knee in Week 6 at Jacksonville after he was questionable entering that game with an ankle injury.\n\nSaints tight end Jared Cook (ankle) will also miss the Sunday NFC showdown with the Bears.\n\n\u2014Green Bay is set to take on the Oakland Raiders without Davante Adams. The Packers\u2019 top wide receiver remains sidelined by a painful turf toe injury after missing wins over the Dallas Cowboys and Detroit Lions the past two weeks.\n\nPackers head coach Matt LaFleur said the team is likely to make a call on wide receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling (knee, ankle) before kickoff at Lambeau Field on Sunday. Wide receiver Geronimo Allison (concussion) isn\u2019t ruled out, but will need to be cleared medically to play Week 7 after leaving Green Bay\u2019s Monday win over the Lions with a head injury.\n\n\u2014Dallas wide receivers Amari Cooper and Randall Cobb, who both missed practice on Wednesday because of injuries, were among a handful of Cowboys still listed as questionable for the weekend on the Friday injury report.

Ramsey missed three consecutive games with the Jacksonville Jaguars because of a back injury before he was traded this week.\n\n\u2014New York Jets guard Kelechi Osemele is involved in a dispute with the team regarding the severity of his shoulder injury, multiple media outlets reported.\n\nOsemele, a two-time Pro Bowl selection acquired from the Oakland Raiders prior to the season, maintains that he needs a season-ending operation to repair a torn labrum. However, the Jets have told him he must be back practicing on Saturday or he will be hit with a fine or a suspension, multiple media outlets reported.\n\n\u2014Cincinnati Bengals offensive tackle Cordy Glenn was suspended one game for internal disciplinary reasons, the team announced. Glenn will miss Sunday\u2019s game against the Jaguars.
