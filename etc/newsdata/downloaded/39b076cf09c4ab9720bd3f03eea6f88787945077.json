The cost of drugs is another area of concern.\n\nPelosi and other leading Democrats have indicated they would support a replacement for the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement if more progress could be made on some of their demands.\n\nRead: Trump\u2019s Impeachment Is More Important to Washington Than Wall Street\n\nYet Pelosi on Tuesday suddenly threw her support behind a plan to launch an impeachment inquiry, potentially causing a rupture in those talks. She said Trump\u2019s request that Ukraine investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden crossed the line.\n\nRead: Pelosi announces Trump impeachment inquiry, saying \u2018no one is above the law\u2019\n\nTrump responded by calling the actions of Pelosi and Democrats \u201cwitch hunt garbage.\u201d\n\nThe last time a president faced an impeachment inquiry and vote in 1998-1999, virtually nothing got done in Congress during the five months the process played out.\n\nThe Republican-led House voted to begin impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton on Oct. 8, 1998 and voted to impeach him on Dec. 19, 1998. A Senate trial began in early January and the Democratic-controlled Senate voted to acquit Clinton a month later.\n\nThe executive branch, for its part, continued to function normally during that time. President Clinton even launched a four-day bombing campaign in Iraq just several days before the House voted to impeach him, drawing accusations that he was trying to distract from the scandal.\n\nSome analysts suggest China could stall in trade negotiations with the U.S. to see if Trump is hurt by the political controversy, but public polling has been split on whether it would hurt the president. It\u2019s also highly unlikely Republicans in the Senate would find the president guilty in an impeachment trial absent a smoking gun.", "description": "The 25-year-old NAFTA trade deal with Mexico and Canada could stick around for a while if Democrats proceed to impeach President Trump.", "authors": ["Jeffry Bartash"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GK646_g7_060_ZG_20180611085320.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
