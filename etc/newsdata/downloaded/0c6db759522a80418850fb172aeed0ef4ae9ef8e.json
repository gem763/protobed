Qian Prefecture, had to slowly chisel away at the porcelain and concrete.\n\nA frame from the video shows (left) how the man's arm was firmly wedged into the toilet's piping. It took firefighters 30 minutes to slowly chip away at the porcelain and free his arm\n\nFirefighters cover the trapped man's face to protect it from the flying chips of porcelain and concrete as they work to liberate him\n\nThe firefighters covered the man's face, as they performed the delicate operation, that took a painstaking 30 minutes to complete.\n\nEventually the man was liberated from his awkward predicament, largely unscathed.\n\nHe was left with just a slightly swollen right arm and no other major grazes or bruises, beyond his pride.\n\nThe fish was not recovered.", "description": "A video of the man's rescue on October 3 shows him lying on the tiles of his workers' dormitory toilet, in Taijiang County, with his hand and arm firmly lodged inside the pipes.", "authors": ["Corazon Miller For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/14/19443606-0-image-a-101_1570542926220.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
