Already a major champion, 22-year-old went into the final round at Columbia Edgewater Country Club three shots behind American teenager Yealimi Noh and shot a five-under 67 to beat the precocious Monday qualifier by one stroke with a 21-under total.\n\nRory McIlroy plays down the money factor after FedEx Cup success Read more\n\nGreen drew level with Noh when she holed a lengthy, curling putt at the 17th hole and closed it out with a two-metre par putt at the last as her playing partner made bogey. The West Australian had to overcome a big stumble in the third round when she shot 73 to squander the five-shot lead she had built after opening rounds of 64 and 63. She did so while battling head-to-head with 18-year-old Noh in the final group, making six birdies \u2013 three on each nine \u2013 as she turned up the heat on the rookie, who shot 71.\n\nGreen said lessons from her maiden victory at the Women\u2019s PGA Championship in June had paid off. \u201cI can definitely say having that experience helped me, especially over the last five holes,\u201d she said. \u201cGrinding out and making sure that I stayed patient. I think the putt on 17 was obviously huge to get me tied with Yealimi coming into the last hole. And the clutch putt on the last is something that I will remember for a long time.\u201d\n\nIn her second year on the tour, Green went into the tournament as world No 26 and is set to climb to a career high ranking when they updated on Monday. Her $US195,000 winner\u2019s cheque took her season earnings to $US979,519 for the season and her career earnings to $US1,223,993.\n\nHannah Green: Australia's latest world-beating sportswoman | Rod Morri Read more\n\n\u201cI definitely don\u2019t want to get too ahead of myself,\u201d Green said. \u201cThe win at KPMG I was really surprised with and even the first two rounds this week I was surprised with. So I don\u2019t want to get too cocky but I also want to make sure that I don\u2019t sell myself short and hopefully get myself in this position more.\u201d\n\nNoh finished three shots clear of third-placed Brittany Altomare but was shattered after missing out on becoming only the third Monday qualifier to win on the tour. \u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d an emotional Noh said. \u201cI tried my best. My shots weren\u2019t going how I wanted today.\u201d", "description": "The Australian major champion stormed home to claim her second LPGA Tour victory, winning the Portland Classic in a thrilling final-group shootout", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fb3dcc56cbfb3ff9efddb2d0d251eb97eee3eed/0_261_4584_2751/master/4584.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=69bab9a2991f5ea887d2bf1480fc9f77"}
