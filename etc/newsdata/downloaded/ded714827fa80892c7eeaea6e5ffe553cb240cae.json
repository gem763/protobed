COLI-LINKED DEATH TRACED TO SUPERMARKET BURGER HE ATE NEARLY A DECADE AGO\n\n\u201cInitially, he ignored it as it did not cause any discomfort,\u201d Dr. Vishal Gajbhiye, told SWNS of his patient, Shyam Lal Yadav. \u201cAlso, he got the growth cut by the local barber. But, when the lump hardened and started growing further, he approached the hospital at Sagar.\u201d\n\nGajbhiye said he diagnosed his patient with a sebaceous horn, also referred to in medical cases as a devil\u2019s horn. It typically occurs in a sun-exposed area of the face and hands, and is made up of a keratin mound, according to a case report documented in the U.S. National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health.\n\nGajbhiye removed his patient\u2019s growth with a sterile razor and used a skin graft to close the opening in his head, which has \u201cnow healed completely,\u201d according to SWNS. The growth was found to be benign, but he likely faces treatment in the future to prevent regrowth.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAccording to SWNS, Gajbhiye submitted the case to the International Journal of Surgery because of its rarity.", "description": "The man's barber had been shaving it down for him.", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/unicorn-growth-411631.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
