They have both parlayed national anthem protests and leftist activism, into lucrative ad campaign deals with Nike.\n\nRapinoe, the U.S. Women\u2019s National Team star who made headlines this summer for profanely dismissing any possibility of visiting the White House after the Women\u2019s World Cup, is set to join Binx Walton and John Waters as a part of a capsule collection from Nordstrom Vice President Olivia Kim, who has partnered with Nike.\n\nAccording to the New York Post:\n\nKim is known in the fashion world as a creative force as well as a street-style-worthy dresser, so it was only a matter of time until she would create a collection of her own. The brand announced Nike x Olivia Kim Thursday, Elle reports, calling the collection a fuse between \u201990s subculture in New York where DIY fashion reigned the streets and youth culture everywhere was reclaiming their childhood through sartorial expression.\u2019\n\nIn June, in response to a reporter\u2019s question about whether she would visit the White House, Rapinoe said she would not go \u201cto the f*ck*ng White House.\u201d\n\nWatch:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to the fucking White House.\u201d \u2013 @mPinoe pic.twitter.com/sz1ADG2WdT \u2014 Eight by Eight (@8by8mag) June 25, 2019\n\nIn July of this year, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh said that Rapinoe was using her activism to land a Nike deal, just like Colin Kaepernick had done before her.\n\nNike made Kaepernick the face of their \u201cJust Do It\u201d ad campaign, after he led a large anthem protest movement that eventually became pervasive throughout the league, during the 2016 and 2017 seasons. Rapinoe herself adopted Kaepernick\u2019s protest stance when playing for the National Women\u2019s Soccer League.\n\nRapinoe made headlines recently when she was named one of the BBC\u2019s list of 100 Inspiring and Influential Women. The USWNT co-captain also made People magazine\u2019s list of \u201cWomen Changing the World.\u201d\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "description": "What do Colin Kaepernick and Megan Rapinoe have in common?
