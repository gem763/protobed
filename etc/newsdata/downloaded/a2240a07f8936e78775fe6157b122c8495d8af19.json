A parallel trend has also been hitting the grilled cheese forums (there\u2019s a message board for everything), where folks are slathering their bread with mayonnaise before griddling, insisting that mayonnaise produces a golden-brown crust that\u2019s superior to the one you get with butter.\n\nAt this point, I suspect that half of you are salivating subconsciously while the other half are quite consciously suppressing a gag reflex.\n\nEven for mayo lovers like me, the image of smearing mayonnaise all over a piece of raw or semi-cooked meat is not the easiest sell. Not everyone likes mayo. It jiggles uncomfortably. It\u2019s nearly pure fat. I get it.\n\nBut you should try it! I first let mayo get intimate with some sous-vide steaks a couple years ago. The steaks browned like a dream. Next I rubbed some mayo on my grilled cheese. It\u2019s true: Mayo really does brown better than butter (though these days I use both).", "description": "You may love it. You may hate it.
