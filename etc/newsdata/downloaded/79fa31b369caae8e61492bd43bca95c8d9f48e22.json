Al-Baghdadi reportedly detonated a suicide vest when facing imminent capture, killing himself and three of his young children.\n\nPresident Trump thanked the government of Turkey, long accused of aiding Islamic State recruits by not sufficiently protecting its border with Syria, for aiding the operation.\n\nTrump also thanked the government of Russia, now active in the northwest region of Syria where the raid occurred, and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a majority-Kurdish militia that was largely responsible for the fall of ISIS in Raqqa, its \u201ccapital.\u201d Mazloum Abdi, the general commander of the SDF, confirmed on Twitter that it had cooperated with the raid, offering intelligence for five months.\n\nFor five months there has been joint intel cooperation on the ground and accurate monitoring, until we achieved a joint operation to kill Abu Bakir al-Bagdadi. Thanks to everybody who participate in this great mission.@realDonaldTrump#SDF#USArmy #Rojava #Baghdadi \u2014 Mazloum Abd\u00ee \u0645\u0638\u0644\u0648\u0645 \u0639\u0628\u062f\u064a (@MazloumAbdi) October 27, 2019\n\nYeni Safak, which regularly toes the Turkish government line that the SDF is a terrorist organization, carried the news of Trump thanking Turkey, but not the SDF. The newspaper is popular among supporters of President Erdogan and considered close enough to Erdogan\u2019s Islamist Justice and Development Party (AKP) that it often acts as a propaganda wing of the government.\n\nKarag\u00fcl\u2019s column blaming America and Israel for most of the world\u2019s terrorist activity, dated Friday, remains on the front page of the newspaper on Sunday at press time.\n\nThe column \u2013 titled \u201cThe global black market for terrorism: Who requests these tenders? The EU establishes a terrorist organization, but the US and Israel are its true masters. UAE\u2019s MBZ and Saudi Arabia\u2019s MBS, the two crown princes who are \u2018brokers of terror\u2019; it\u2019s game over, your turn will come.\u201d \u2013 claimed that the \u201cU.S. and Israel are the big bosses of global terrorism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese countries, which have turned \u2018fighting terrorism\u2019 into a global political doctrine, actually invented that term to veil their terrorist organizations,\u201d Karag\u00fcl wrote. He did not provide any evidence for Israel having collaborated in the creation of terrorist organizations.\n\nFor the United States, Karag\u00fcl cited America\u2019s ties to the SDF \u2013 which he, like the Erdogan government, considers the same entity as the Marxist Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) terrorist groups \u2013 which Trump credited in part for the success in neutralizing al-Baghdadi.\n\nThe U.S. administration was able to openly declare a terrorist organization, the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), as its \u201cpartner.\u201d And against a NATO ally too. The ethnic terrorism that has been used against our country for the last four decades was actually these countries\u2019 covert war against Turkey. The buildup in north Syria is the most open and most reckless support ever given to a terrorist organization in world history. The deal struck in Ankara, which ensures the PKK and U.S.\u2019s withdrawal from the area, certified that the U.S. really is a terror boss. They made a deal with our country for a terrorist organization. Through this deal, we declared to the world their role as a \u201cterror boss.\u201d There is no other greater shame than this for the U.S.\n\nKarag\u00fcl also claimed that European Union members \u201cestablish terrorist organizations, finance them, train them, deploy them to countries, and specify clear-cut targets,\u201d without elaborating.\n\nKarag\u00fcl concluded, without offering any transition in topic, that the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) should be \u201copenly held accountable of and charged for being a global terror financier, for assassination and dirty, covert operations.\u201d He added the allegation that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) directly ordered the killing of Islamist Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nKarag\u00fcl has not made any public statements at press time regarding the al-Baghdadi raid. He has insisted in the past on claiming that al-Baghdadi was an American asset and that Washington created the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cWe have been saying for a long time that Daesh was founded by the U.S. itself. Turkey is the only country that truly fought against Daesh. Daesh is not a terrorist organization, it is an occupation tool,\u201d the editor-in-chief said in 2017. Yeni Safak has also alleged that the CIA evacuated ISIS terrorists from Syria to repurpose them against enemies in the future.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "One of Turkey's most belligerent Ottoman imperialist newspapers boasted a column Sunday calling America the \"big bosses of global terrorism.\"", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Erdogan-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
