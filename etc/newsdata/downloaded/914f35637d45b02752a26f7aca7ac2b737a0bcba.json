The interest rate on excess reserves (IOER), will now be set at 1.80%.\n\nBut repo rates still floated high in late trade Wednesday, promoting the Fed to announce its third $75 billion overnight operation of the week for 8:15 a.m. Eastern on Thursday to help juice liquidity.\n\nU.S. stocks closed mixed after the Fed cut, leaving the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.13% and S&P 500 index SPX, +0.03% with modest gains, after doubt cropped up on future stimulus.\n\nWho is bearing the brunt of higher repo rates?\n\nBroker-dealers, hedge funds and other institutional investors who rely on leverage to run their operations are seeing the biggest impact of higher overnight repo rates, said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, which in May became one of 24 primary dealers in the U.S. Treasury debt market.\n\n\u201cThe repo market is the market where people running leveraged positions borrow,\u201d Stanley told MarketWatch in an interview. \u201cObviously, that doesn\u2019t apply to 401(k) funds or mutual funds, where you are investing real money without leverage.\u201d\n\nWhat sort of reaction has the Federal Reserve Bank of New York seen this week from its open-market repo operations?\n\nThe Fed on Tuesday offered $75 billion through its facility and saw $53 billion of demand from borrowers like banks and dealers, allowing them to swap lower-risk Treasury holdings for cash at minimal rates. On Wednesday, the Fed again offered the same $75 billion facility and received $80 billion in bids.\n\n\u201cThis second operation was planned and executed in a better fashion than yesterday\u2019s, and we view the incremental $22 billion as market participants making sure they have all the funding they need in a time of uncertainty,\u201d wrote Brian Reynolds, chief market strategist at Reynolds Strategy, in a Wednesday note to clients.\n\nCould the Fed be forced to step in again beyond Thursday?\n\nIt\u2019s very likely. Repo rates were quoted around 2.50% following Wednesday\u2019s Fed operation, after spiking at times to 4% and 5% earlier in the morning \u2014 and as high as almost 10% following Monday\u2019s operation, according to Amherst Pierpont\u2019s Stanley.\n\nFollowing the Fed\u2019s afternoon quarter-point rate cut, repo rate pushed above the central bank\u2019s newly-lower target.\n\n\u201cWe would have been closer to normal before the rate cut,\u201d Stanley said, adding that Powell\u2019s comments on Wednesday seemed to signal a preference by the central bank to keep reopening its overnight repo facility, rather than tap more dramatic modes of interventions to improve market liquidity.\n\n\u201cThere seemed no great sense of urgency to do a broader policy operation,\u201d he said.\n\nCould disruptions in overnight rates lead to another crisis?\n\nNot according to economists at Credit Suisse, who said Wednesday that the Fed will not lose control of interest rates if it maintains a flexible balance sheet to keep rates on target.\n\n\u201cToday isn\u2019t the day,\u201d wrote economists at Credit Suisse led by James Sweeney. \u201cThis is not a collapse of interbank lending driven by precautionary demand. Speculative demand is at work now, meaning relative supply and demand in various funding markets is contributing to the upside risk in repo rates, but without any precautionary hoarding.\u201d\n\nCheck out: Fed lowers interest rate by a quarter-point, and many on panel foresee another cut this year\n\nWhat could the Fed do to bring more permanent calm to the market?\n\nUBS economists said they expect more repo operations with the primary dealers, in a note to clients Wednesday. \u201cBefore the financial crisis, the Fed did daily repo operations. There was also a book of term repos. The Fed will now likely err on the side of caution and keep offering repo operations to the primary dealers,\u201d wrote the UBS economists led by Seth Carpenter.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the Fed has regularly said that they want to leave enough reserves for market functioning and then a buffer to avoid these sorts of swings.\u201d", "description": "Broker-dealers, hedge funds and other institutional investors who don\u2019t keep cash on hand for every position they hold are the most vulnerable to this week\u2019s...", "authors": ["Joy Wiltermuth", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR555_NYFED_ZG_20190918140106.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
