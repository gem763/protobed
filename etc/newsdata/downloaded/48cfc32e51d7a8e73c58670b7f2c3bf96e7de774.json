Washington also wants to pressure Tehran to end its support of regional proxy forces, including in Yemen where Saudi forces have been fighting Iran-backed Houthis for four years.\n\nThe United States was still investigating if Iran was behind the Saudi strikes, Trump said, but \"it's certainly looking that way at this moment.\"\n\nTrump, who has spent much of his presidency trying to disentangle the United States from wars he inherited, made clear, however, he was not going to rush into a new conflict on behalf of Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"I'm somebody that would like not to have war,\" Trump said.\n\nSeveral U.S. Cabinet members, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, have blamed Tehran for the strikes. Pompeo and others will travel to Saudi Arabia soon, Trump said.\n\nA day after saying the United States was \"locked and loaded\" to respond to the incident, Trump said on Monday there was \"no rush\" to do so.\n\n\"We have a lot of options but I'm not looking at options right now. We want to find definitively who did this,\" he said.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani said the strikes were carried out by \"Yemeni people\" retaliating for attacks by a Saudi-led military coalition in a war with the Houthi movement.\n\n\"Yemeni people are exercising their legitimate right of defence,\" Rouhani told reporters during a visit to Ankara.\n\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi called the allegations \"unacceptable and entirely baseless.\"\n\nThe attacks cut 5% of world crude oil production.\n\nOil prices surged by as much as 19% after the incidents but later came off their peaks. The intraday jump was the biggest since the 1990-91 Gulf crisis over Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.\n\nThe market eased from its peak after Trump said he would release U.S. emergency supplies and producers said there were enough stocks stored up worldwide to make up for the shortfall. Prices were around 12% higher by afternoon in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nSAUDI SUSPICIONS\n\nSaudi Arabia said the attacks were carried out with Iranian weapons, adding that it was capable of responding forcefully and urging U.N. experts to help investigate the raid.\n\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said Iranian threats were not only directed against the kingdom but against the Middle East and the world.\n\nWhile the prince did not directly accuse Tehran, a Foreign Ministry statement reported him as calling on the international community to condemn whoever was behind the strike.\n\n\"The kingdom is capable of defending its land and people and responding forcefully to those attacks,\" the statement added.\n\nSaudi Arabia and Iran have been enemies for decades and are fighting a number of proxy wars.\n\nTrump said he had not made commitments to protect the Saudis.\n\n\"No, I haven't promised Saudis that. We have to sit down with the Saudis and work something out,\" he said. \"That was an attack on Saudi Arabia, and that wasn't an attack on us. But we would certainly help them.\"\n\nTwo sources briefed on state oil company Saudi Aramco's operations told Reuters it might take months for Saudi oil production to return to normal. Earlier estimates had suggested it could take weeks.\n\nSaudi Arabia said it would be able to meet oil customers' demand from its ample storage, although some deliveries had been disrupted. At least 11 supertankers were waiting to load oil cargoes from Saudi ports, ship tracking data showed on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\nRISING TENSIONS\n\nTension in the oil-producing Gulf region has dramatically escalated this year after Trump imposed severe U.S. sanctions on Iran aimed at halting its oil exports altogether.\n\nFor months, Iranian officials have issued veiled threats, saying that if Tehran is blocked from exporting oil, other countries will not be able to do so either. But Iran has denied a role in specific attacks, including bombings of tankers in the Gulf and previous strikes claimed by the Houthis.", "description": "WASHINGTON/DUBAI (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday said it looked like Iran was behind attacks on oil plants in Saudi Arabia at the weekend that raised fears of a fresh Middle East conflict, but added that he did not want war with anyone.
