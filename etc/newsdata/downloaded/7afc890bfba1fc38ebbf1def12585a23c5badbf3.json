Sanchez had his no-hit bid busted up by a single from Jose Martinez.\n\n\u201cI am here to win,\u201d said Scherzer. \u201cRight now it is about going out there and trying to win ball games.\u201d\n\nScherzer finished with 11 strikeouts, allowed one hit and walked two and has been pitching on just a few days rest in these playoffs.\n\n\u201cI came in and my arm didn\u2019t feel great,\u201d he said. \u201cBut around the fourth or fifth inning I felt like everything kind of loosened up in my shoulder. I was able to find my arm slot and I was driving my fastball into locations where I wanted.\u201d\n\nCardinals ace Wainwright also fanned 11 batters as he allowed seven hits in 7 1/3 innings.\n\nRight hander Hudson closed it out for his third save of the post-season. He missed the series opener to be with his wife, Sara, for the birth of their third child, a girl.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 Washington\u2019s Max Scherzer became the second pitcher to flirt with a no-hitter in as many days as the Nationals stunned", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/def484_washington-nationals-ace-max-scherzer-delivers-pitch-inning-game-two-national-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
