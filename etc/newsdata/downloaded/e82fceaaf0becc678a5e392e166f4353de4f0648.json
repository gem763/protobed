Don't forget about those multitasking moms who feed their cubs AND themselves to grow into fall fatties. After fighting with siblings and fishing to their hearts content, the young tikes have eaten their way into this Olympics of obesity. They can only win with your VOTE,\u201d the park wrote on its Facebook page.\n\nThe first matches open Oct. 2, 6 a.m. AKDT between 775 Lefty and fan-favorite 480 Otis, who won two years in a row, and 854 Divot versus 402 \u2013 using the park\u2019s numbers for the bears plus any nickname.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nIn order to participate, one must \u201clike\u201d the particular bear\u2019s photo posted on the park\u2019s Facebook page. The most liked bear will move on to the next tier and so forth until a victor is chosen on Oct. 8.\n\nFor those who are uneasy about voting for their favorite chunky beast, Explore, a nonprofit that partners with Katmai National Park, provides a live stream of the bears in Brooks Falls that is viewed by millions of people around the world, the park shared.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cEach one of these bears tells a different story about bears in the bear world,\u201d said Mike Fitz, a resident naturalist with Explore and former Katmai park ranger, told Anchorage Daily News.\n\nThe cheeky competition comes as bears begin to prepare for weekend hibernation and start eating \u201cone year\u2019s worth of food in six short months,\u201d according to Katmai National Park.\n\nA particularly large bear, 23-year-old 409 Beadnose, took last year\u2019s competition \u2013 partially due to her sitting-down photo. (Park rangers reportedly have been careful to only capture standing profile pictures this year to even-out the competition.) However, 409 Beadnose is not participating in this year\u2019s contest.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\n\u201cThe brown bears are a symbol of Katmai and Bristol Bay\u2019s healthy ecosystem and serve as a reminder on why we need to support sustainable fisheries and wild areas like Alaska\u2019s national parks,\u201d Fitz said to the local outlet.", "description": "Move over Shark Week, Fat Bear Week is here, and it\u2019s got more to love.", "authors": ["Alexandra Deabler", "Alexandra Deabler Is A Lifestyle Writer", "Editor For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/fat-bear-chart.jpg"}
