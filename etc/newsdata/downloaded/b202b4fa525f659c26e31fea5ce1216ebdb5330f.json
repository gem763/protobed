The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that from 2010 to 2016, global food loss and waste contributed eight to 10 per cent of human-caused GHG emissions .\n\nFifty-eight per cent of food produced in Canada is lost or wasted, amounting to 35.5 million tonnes a year, according to the food rescue organization Second Harvest . A large chunk of that could actually be rescued and eaten \u2014 some of it by you. But how? Well, there's an app for that \u2014 more than one, actually.\n\nFlashfood is a startup that partnered with grocery giant Loblaw earlier this year to sell surplus food at a discount \u2014 typically 50 per cent or more \u2014 at hundreds of Loblaws locations across the country. Through the Flashfood app, each store posts daily offerings, including meat, dairy, bread or packaged foods that are approaching their best-before dates. Fruits and vegetables are sold as a random, five-pound assortment for $5.\n\nUsers shop and pay in the app, then pick up their order from a designated fridge at the store any time during the day.\n\nJosh Domingues, Flashfood's founder and CEO, said the app has more than a million downloads so far, and has diverted more than 907,000 kilograms from the landfill.\n\n\"It'll actually dictate what I buy for dinner,\" Domingues said.\n\nFor those who want to rescue food but don't want to cook it themselves, Toronto residents have another option: an app called Feedback. It offers discounts of 15 to 50 per cent at hundreds of restaurants at off-peak times, such as between lunch and dinner and at the end of the day.\n\nThe app was founded by Toronto cousins Josh and Ben Walters. Josh was inspired by something that happened to him while he was in Italy \u2014 a pizzeria offered him free pizzas at the end of the evening, saying they would otherwise be thrown out.\n\nHe realized then that many other restaurants must face the same problem.\n\nFlashfood and Feedback help reduce waste and greenhouse gas emissions, but also they offer a more immediate perk \u2014 a chance to save money.\n\n\u2014 Emily Chung\n\nReader feedback\n\nWhat do you think are the most pressing environmental issues in Canada? Let us know. We'll publish some of your responses in next week's issue, the last before the federal election.\n\nEmail us at whatonearth@cbc.ca.\n\nOld issues of What on Earth? are right here .\n\nThe Big Picture: Comparing the Canadian political parties' climate plans\n\nClimate change has emerged as a potent theme in the 2019 federal election, and each of the major parties \u2014 the Liberals, Conservatives, NDP and Green Party \u2014 has revealed its climate policies. (The People's Party of Canada does not consider human-caused climate change a threat, and the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois does not have a national climate plan, but supports policies aligned with Quebec's provincial plan.)\n\nCBC asked Navius Research, an economic modelling firm, to project the impact of each party's climate policy on meeting Canada's stated goal of reducing this country's carbon emissions to 511 megatonnes by 2030. The chart below reflects that analysis. (For a deeper dive, read CBC's interactive feature comparing the party's climate policies .)\n\nView each party's platform here:\n\n(CBC)\n\nHot and bothered: Provocative ideas from around the web\n\nAccording to a recent report by the International Monetary Fund, Canada contributed $60 billion in subsidies to the fossil fuel industry in 2015 \u2014 that's about $1,650 per Canadian. This article in The Narwhal argues that subsidies are not only costly but also deter meaningful uptake of cleaner fuels.\n\nThe rising fortune of solar power in Alberta is just another example of how renewable energy worldwide is outperforming forecasts .\n\nExtinction Rebellion: What it is, what it wants\n\n(Paul Faith/Getty Images)\n\nOn Monday the activist group Extinction Rebellion blocked bridges in cities across Canada , including Halifax, Toronto, Edmonton and Vancouver.\n\nWhile the climate action group may have been relatively unknown until now, it has been expanding rapidly around the world. Here's a closer look.\n\nWhat is Extinction Rebellion?\n\nExtinction Rebellion (XR) was launched by British activists Roger Hallam and Gail Bradbrook on Oct. 31, 2018 \u2014 shortly after a report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said policymakers have only 12 years to stop global catastrophic climate change .\n\nThe group is also concerned about findings that suggest humanity has entered the sixth global mass extinction event . XR's symbol is an hourglass in a circle that represents time running out. Its mandate is to draw attention to the mass extinction of life on Earth and \"minimize the risk of social collapse.\"\n\nHow big is XR?\n\nThe group says its first protest in 2018 drew 1,500 people to Parliament Square in London. It has now spread to more than 60 countries with 350 local groups .\n\nAccording to its website, there are more than 30 XR groups across Canada, at both the local and provincial levels.\n\nWhat is XR demanding and from whom?\n\nExtinction Rebellion has three primary demands of governments:\n\nDeclare a climate and ecological emergency.\n\nAct immediately to stop the loss of biodiversity and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025.\n\n\"Create and be led by the decisions of a Citizens' Assembly on climate and ecological justice.\"\n\nWhat kinds of tactics does XR use?\n\nAccording to the group , it \"uses nonviolent civil disobedience.\" Its members' tactics include blocking traffic on bridges and thoroughfares and glueing themselves to public buildings.\n\nBritish author and environmental activist George Monbiot is a strong supporter of XR, and said the group is unlike anything he's seen before.\n\n\"It's really the first movement in my life that's been of sufficient scale to address this issue,\" Monbiot told CBC. \"I've been an activist and journalist in this field for 34 years, and there've been lots of movements coming and going, and a lot of them have been great \u2026 but none of them has reached this scale and this impact.\"\n\nWhy has this movement caught on so quickly?\n\nLaurie Adkin, an associate professor at the University of Alberta's department of political science, said it's unclear why XR has grown so quickly. One possibility is that in addition to the participation of many young people, we're seeing an older generation of climate researchers and citizens concerned about climate change taking part after decades of political inaction. Adkin also said that XR might have staying power.\n\n\"I think it has a lot of growth potential because the crisis we're facing is truly an existential one,\" said Adkin.\n\n\u2014 Nicole Mortillaro\n\nStay in touch!\n\nAre there issues you'd like us to cover?
