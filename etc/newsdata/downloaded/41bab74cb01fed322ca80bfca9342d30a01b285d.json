The country logged 123 billion yen ($1.13 billion) in trade deficit in September, following a Y143.5 billion deficit in August.\n\nJapan's exports to China fell 6.7% on year, reflecting weak demand for semiconductor-making equipment and car parts. Exports to the U.S. dropped 7.9% as shipments of cars, auto parts and motors declined.\n\nThe weak results came as investors are looking closely for clues on whether the Bank of Japan will follow other major central banks in taking additional easing action to prevent an economic downturn. The BOJ's policy board is slated to hold a policy-setting meeting next week and release an outlook report on the economy and prices.\n\nWrite to Megumi Fujikawa at megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com", "description": "TOKYO--Japan's exports declined for the 10th straight month in September as demand continued to slow in the nation's major trade partners such as the U.S....", "authors": ["Megumi Fujikawa"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
