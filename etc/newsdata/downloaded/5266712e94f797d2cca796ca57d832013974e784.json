It was widely rumored that Rihanna rebuffed the NFL as a show of solidarity to former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick.\n\nOn Wednesday, Rihanna confirmed that was the case.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIn an interview with Abby Aguirre of Vogue, Rihanna said she didn\u2019t want to \u201cbe a sellout\u201d or an \u201cenabler,\u201d so she turned down the NFL.\n\nI ask Rihanna if we can discuss politics. \u201cHow deep you wanna get?\u201d she says. \u201cHowever deep you\u2019re willing to go,\u201d I say. She signals that I may proceed, and I ask if it\u2019s true that she turned down the Super Bowl halftime show in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t dare do that. For what? Who gains from that? Not my people. I just couldn\u2019t be a sellout. I couldn\u2019t be an enabler. There\u2019s things within that organization that I do not agree with at all, and I was not about to go and be of service to them in any way.\u201d\n\nKaepernick, 31, last played in the NFL in 2016. He protested racial injustice in the United States that season, taking a knee during the national anthem. That decision drew plenty of criticism, particularly from President Donald Trump. Kaepernick hit free agency that offseason, went unsigned and hasn\u2019t played in the NFL since. Kaepernick has made it clear he would like to return to the NFL.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nRihanna\u2019s comment suggests she\u2019s still opposed to working with the NFL. That wasn\u2019t the case for Jay-Z, who also reportedly turned down the Super Bowl LII halftime show in support of Kaepernick.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn August, Jay-Z entered into a partnership with the NFL focused on entertainment and social justice. The decision drew criticism from Carolina Panthers safety Eric Reid, who accused Jay-Z of parroting NFL talking points when speaking about Kaepernick.\n\nJay-Z\u2019s partnership with the NFL may have opened the door for him to headline a Super Bowl halftime show in the future. If that happens, don\u2019t expect Rihanna to join that performance unless the NFL has mended its relationship with Kaepernick.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
