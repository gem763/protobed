Bishop Matthew Kukah of Sokoto said that sealed borders ensure that migration is carried out in an orderly fashion and protect law-abiding citizens from criminals.\n\n\u201cFor me as a Nigerian, I would gladly recommend walls especially for the northern parts of Nigeria where thousands of murderers, bandits and outlaws have invaded and claimed the lives of hundreds of citizens, destroyed hundreds of communities and so on,\u201d the bishop said.\n\nFor its part, Sudan has closed its borders with Libya and the Central African Republic for \u201csecurity reasons,\u201d officials have declared. A statement issued by the Sudanese authorities said that any vehicle crossing the border between these two nations does so illegally.\n\nIn June, Kenya closed its border with Somalia and suspended cross-border trade as part of security operations against the al-Shabaab terrorist group. \u201cIn addition to safety concerns, we are also aware of human trafficking and narcotics, which must cease,\u201d said police chief Kioi Muchangi, adding that \u201cthe border will remain closed until further notice.\u201d Kenya has repeatedly closed its border with Somalia, either for security or diplomatic reasons.\n\nIn August, Uganda and Rwanda agreed to reopen borders between the two countries and pledged to resolve a diplomatic dispute that had raised fears of hostility. Rwanda had closed a busy border crossing with Uganda in February, accusing the neighbor of having carried out excessive checks on its citizens and supporting the rebel groups against the Kigali government.\n\nRwanda also recently briefly closed its border with the Democratic Republic of Congo for health reasons, following the confirmation of a third death from Ebola in the Congolese city of Goma. The city is located just opposite the Rwandan city of Gisenyi and many residents of the two cities cross the border for work and other activities.\n\nEquatorial Guinea announced plans in August to build a wall along its shared border with Cameroon. Equatorial Guinea has accused Cameroon of having illegally brought Western Africans into its territory.\n\nAs one of Africa\u2019s wealthiest nations, Equatorial Guinea has been particularly attentive to border security following the arrest of 30 heavily armed men from Chad, Sudan and CAR along the border in what it perceived as an \u201cattempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat by mercenaries.\u201d\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "A number of African nations have recently closed their borders just as Europe is relaxing its own external borders.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
