Trump cancels G7 Doral invite", "language": "en", "text": "This is probably going to go down as one of the shortest-lived \u201cscandals\u201d in the history of the Trump presidency. On Thursday, the White House Chief of Staff announced that next year\u2019s G-7 summit would be held at President Trump\u2019s Doral resort in Florida. That led to the usual screeching and rending of clothing from the peanut gallery but the impending national nightmare only lasted two days. Yesterday the President reversed course and said they would look for a new location. (NBC News)\n\nFollowing widespread bipartisan criticism, President Donald Trump said Saturday his Doral resort in Florida would not host next year\u2019s Group of Seven summit of world leaders after all. \u201cBased on both Media & Democrat Crazed and Irrational Hostility, we will no longer consider Trump National Doral, Miami, as the Host Site for the G-7 in 2020,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWe will begin the search for another site, including the possibility of Camp David, immediately.\u201d The president had been under fire for the choice, announced Thursday by acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, because it could ultimately benefit him financially. Mulvaney said world leaders would be able to stay at his resort at cost.\n\nThis was one of the most surprising headlines of the year, at least to me. And that\u2019s for a couple of reasons. First of all, since when does Donald Trump back down on any decision that he\u2019s made, be it for better or for worse? Not very often. The President seems to enjoy a good fight more than actually winning the confrontation and if both the media and the Democrats wanted to complain about the G-7 being held at Doral, I\u2019d assumed he\u2019d be bashing them over it at rallies and fundraising off the kerfuffle.\n\nThe aspect of this \u201cscandal\u201d that makes it even more surprising is that it should have been such an easy fight to win. There\u2019s no denying the fact that if the Doral had been booked for the summit in a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d fashion it could, at least in theory, put some extra cash from foreign world leaders in the Trump family\u2019s coffers. So the emoluments clause would have been in play, at least enough to give the press something else to complain about for a few months.\n\nBut the Doral could have offered to host the event without charging the visiting world leaders anything and written their expenses off as a loss. The prestige of hosting the event would likely still be more than enough for them and they\u2019d likely have made up the loss through increased traffic. (Surely some people would be interested in booking a suite just to watch the comings and goings.)\n\nSome sort of deal along those lines would have swung the ball back into Trump\u2019s court, allowing him to justifiably claim that he was saving the taxpayer\u2019s money. Going to Camp David is going to run up a bill footed by the voters. (Granted, the amount of money we\u2019re talking about in comparison to the national budget isn\u2019t even a rounding error, but the principle still stands.)\n\nBesides, it\u2019s not as if these summits haven\u2019t been held in posh, privately owned locations on a regular basis. Last year when Justin Trudeau was hosting, the event was held at Hotel Fairmont Le Manoir Richelieu, a world-class, luxury resort in Quebec. And while Trudeau may not own the resort personally, if you don\u2019t think the actual owners aren\u2019t players on the political field you\u2019re fooling yourself.\n\nThis reversal leaves me pondering just where things stand in the Oval Office these days. Exit question(s): Is Trump privately getting worried about the ongoing impeachment follies to the point where he didn\u2019t want to toss any more ammunition to Pelosi and company? And if so, did somebody steer him away from this idea\u2026 perhaps Rudy?", "description": "A rare concession", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Doral.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
