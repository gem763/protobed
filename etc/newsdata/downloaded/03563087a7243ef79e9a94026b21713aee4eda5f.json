And then you know you're winning!\" Thunberg wrote on Twitter and Instagram.\n\n\"I have Asperger's and that means I'm sometimes a bit different from the norm. And \u2013 given the right circumstances \u2013being different is a superpower.\"\n\nThunberg continued, outlining that her reason for not being public about her diagnosis is not because she wishes to \"hide\" behind it, but because of how \"ignorant people\" may respond.\n\n\"I know many ignorant people still see it as an 'illness', or something negative. And believe me, my diagnosis has limited me before,\" the Swedish student stated.\n\n\"Before I started school striking I had no energy, no friends and I didn't speak to anyone. I just sat alone at home, with an eating disorder.\n\n\"All of that is gone now, since I have found a meaning, in a world that sometimes seems shallow and meaningless to so many people.\"\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
