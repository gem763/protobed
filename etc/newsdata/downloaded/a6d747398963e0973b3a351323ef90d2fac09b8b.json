The tips helped lead them to the migrant.\n\n\u201cThis individual brazenly ignored U.S. immigration law, while simultaneously threatening the lives of the brave men and women sworn to uphold it,\u201d said Patrick Contreras, field office director for ICE in Houston.\n\nHe called the threats \u201ccowardly.\u201d\n\nICE has become a focal point for criticism in recent years \u2014 but some have gone further and targeted the agency and its personnel for violence. An ICE office in Portland, Oregon, was shut down for several weeks last year because of violent protests, and an anti-ICE activist parroting Democrats\u2019 criticism of the agency was killed during an attack on an ICE facility in Tacoma, Washington, earlier this year.\n\nThe agency\u2019s office in San Antonio was also attacked by a gunman who fired rounds into the building, doing property damage.\n\nICE officials say their mission has been distorted by opponents and that\u2019s fueling unearned anger.\n\nMr. Diaz-Rodriguez\u2019s five times sneaking into the U.S. are striking, but are far from the record.\n\nThe Washington Times reported last year on an illegal immigrant who\u2019d been deported 44 times in 15 years.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
