(Giacomo Panico/CBC)\n\nWatson said he recently summoned senior officials from Confederation Line builder Rideau Transit Group (RTG) to his board room to seek solutions to the ongoing problems.\n\n\"We're not satisfied. We need to get these problems resolved, and we need to get the bus issue resolved,\" Watson said he told them.\n\nOn Wednesday, he said the city could withhold payments from RTG until the issues are resolved, but he didn't specify how much is still owed, or under what specific conditions the city might do that.\n\nDespite the disruptions, Watson noted that for the most part, the trains are on time and running smoothly.\n\n\"But when you have, you know, 10 per cent or 20 per cent of the people having a bad experience, you hear loud and clear from them. And we've got to do better.\"\n\nThe 2020 draft budget will be tabled Nov. 6.", "description": "Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson says there will be money set aside in next week's draft budget to help alleviate some of the problems plaguing the city's transit system.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5341343.1572459364!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/mayor-jim-watson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
