I'm not going to pre-commit, there is a lot of contingencies there.\"\n\nHe said the IMF had stressed the precarious nature of the world economy, which has prompted other central banks including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to provide more stimulus.\n\n\"We have to take that into account. How much momentum is there in the global economy?\" Carney said.\n\nHis comments echoed a statement by the BoE after its policy meeting in September when it said it expected to raise rates gradually, as long as a no-deal Brexit shock to the economy was avoided and global growth picked up.\n\nLater on Friday, Carney said that in 16 years of attending meetings at the IMF he had never seen the level of concern among global finance chiefs about barriers to trade.\n\nAsked to sum up the mood at the gathering, Carney described it as \"the almost existential uncertainty about the structure of the trading system.\"\n\nThe IMF this week warned that the U.S.-China trade war will cut 2019 global growth to its slowest pace since the financial crisis, and things could get a lot worse if the trade tensions remain unresolved.", "description": "Brexit deal 'good news' but global growth key for BoE rates too - Carney", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9H1RM_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
