Pick a stick and that\u2019s what we are having.\"\n\nOther members loved the 'great idea', with one writing: \"I\u2019m planning to do something like this for jobs around the house for the kids.\n\n\"Never thought of doing one for meals too.\"\n\nIt's definitely an idea we'll be stealing.", "description": "Mum-of-two Lou says the meal planning board has made life 'so much easier'", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20715547.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_241019SLUG_7007JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
