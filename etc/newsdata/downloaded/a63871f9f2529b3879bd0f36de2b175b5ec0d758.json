CNN reported that 60,000 requests have been approved and 20,000 have been denied to date.\n\nImporters, however, have complained the process is opaque and favors larger companies that can thwart exemption requests put forward by smaller ones. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross changed the system late last year to give small companies additional time to respond to objections.\n\nThe New York Times reported last year that two of the nation's largest steel manufacturers successfully derailed hundreds of exemption requests for American companies that relied on products like imported pipes, screws, and wire for their supply chains.", "description": "The Department of Commerce has come under repeated fire for an opaque tariff exemption process that some say favors larger companies.", "authors": ["Joseph Zeballos-Roig"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db9e70edee019490848af23?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
