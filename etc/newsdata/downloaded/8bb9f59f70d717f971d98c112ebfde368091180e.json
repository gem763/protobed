More than 100 people were taken to hospital and 30 police were injured.\n\nTuesday's unrest saw police fire 900 rubber bullets and 1,400 rounds of tear gas. That compares with 1,000 tear gas canisters fired in the first two months of protests.\n\nHow was the journalist hurt?\n\nVideo of Sunday's incident shows the rubber bullet being fired at a group of protesters and journalists on a footbridge in the city's Wan Chai area.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Protesters clash with police on the streets of Hong Kong\n\nThe round hit her glasses from a range of 12 metres (40ft), injuring both her eyes, said lawyer Michael Vidler.\n\nShe was taken to hospital where, on Wednesday, doctors confirmed she would be permanently blind in one eye.\n\nThe journalist, who works for Indonesian-language newspaper Suara, had been wearing a high-visibility vest and helmet marked \"press\".\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption A protest against police use of force was held in Hong Kong\n\nShe was later quoted as saying another journalist had shouted \"Don't shoot, we're journalists\" just before she was shot.\n\nConfirming the journalist had been hurt, Indonesia's consulate general in Hong Kong urged its citizens to avoid Wan Chai and other areas caught up in the unrest.\n\nAnis Hidayah, director of the Migrant Care non-governmental organisation, said Hong Kong's government should take responsibility for the incident.\n\n\"The Indonesian government through the Consulate General in Hong Kong should take swift action to investigate this,\" she told The Jakarta Post.\n\nOn Wednesday, demonstrators in Hong Kong held a march to protest against what they say is the police's excessive use of force.\n\nWhy has the unrest got so violent?\n\nThe protests were sparked earlier this year by a proposed law, which would have allowed extradition from Hong Kong to the Chinese mainland.\n\nOpponents thought this would put Hong Kongers at risk of unfair trials, and, in July, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said the law \"was dead\".\n\nBut despite the law being withdrawn, the protests have continued every weekend.\n\nClashes between police and protesters have created their own momentum, and there is wider discontent too.\n\nRecent years have seen growing opposition to the perceived encroachment of Beijing on Hong Kong's politics and threats to local identity.\n\nMany young people have economic worries, and there are also demands for universal suffrage for elections to Hong Kong's parliament.\n\nWhat is the background?\n\nUntil 1997, Hong Kong was a British territory. Since then, it has been part of China but with its own system of law and government - known as One Country, Two Systems.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How Hong Kong got trapped in a cycle of violence\n\nHong Kong has its own judiciary and a separate legal system. Rights including freedom of assembly and freedom of speech are protected.\n\nBut those freedoms - the Basic Law - expire in 2047. It is not clear what Hong Kong's status will be then.", "description": "Police use of force draws protests in Hong Kong after a reporter loses sight in one eye during unrest.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17B5C/production/_109061179_056934405-1.jpg"}
