If natural gas becomes the next coal, that's going to be a real challenge.\u201d\n\nThe coal industry has been battered by all sides over the past decade, crushed by the surge of shale gas itself and by renewable energy, but also squeezed by a shrinking pool of capital as banks and insurers cut off finance. For instance, on Wednesday, insurer Axis Capital announced that it would restrict insurance to both coal and tar sands oil.\n\nTo date, the gas industry, although having been under fire from environmental groups for years, has been spared the draconian crackdown by both capital markets and regulatory action. In fact, Big Oil has made a massive bet on natural gas as the future, which oil executives view as a hedge against peak oil demand.\n\nBut the political winds are shifting quickly. Earlier this year, Berkeley, California became the first U.S. city to ban new natural gas hookups in new buildings. Menlo Park and Windsor soon followed, and dozens of other cities are exploring similar prohibitions.\n\nSome Democratic presidential candidates have vowed to ban fracking if elected.\n\nRelated: Oil Prices Jump On A Lone Piece Of Bullish News\n\nThe industry risks losing its social license to operate. Record levels of gas flaring in Texas is surely not helping matters.\n\nCharlie Riedl of the Center of Liquefied Natural Gas told S&P Global Platts that the industry has to do more to slash emissions.\n\nIt\u2019s notable that the reference to gas becoming the new coal has been uttered by several industry executives in the past few weeks. \u201cThe industry really is at a critical juncture,\u201d Woodside Petroleum CEO Peter Coleman said at a recent conference in Houston. \u201cWe run the risk of being demonized like that other fossil fuel out there called coal.\u201d\n\nFor the oil industry, this is very much an existential problem. Many large oil companies are massive gas producers as well, and their portfolios are trending in a more gas-heavy direction.\n\nJudging by BP\u2019s recent PR blitz, they appear worried about the direction that the conversation on gas is taking.\n\nAs the world needs more energy with fewer emissions, we see cleaner-burning natural gas as a perfect partner to renewables. \u2014 BP America (@BP_America) October 15, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nBP\u2019s CEO Bob Dudley said that Michael Bloomberg\u2019s $500 million campaign to kill off natural gas-fired power plants is \u201cirresponsible.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery scenario I look at, we cannot carpet the world with renewables fast enough,\u201d Dudley told CNBC.\n\nDudley\u2019s counterpart at Shell also doubled down this week, calling the \u201cdemonization\u201d of oil and gas \u201cunjustified.\u201d Shell has gone to great lengths to cast its business as one in transition, and last year the company announced that it would tie executive pay to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nBy some measures, Shell is ahead of its peers. But that is a low bar to clear. The amount of money spent on clean energy by the oil majors is a pittance. ExxonMobil, for instance, spent a tiny fraction of 1 percent of its overall spending on low-carbon technologies between 2010 and 2018.\n\nShell\u2019s CEO Ben van Beurden has struck a more conciliatory tone than his American competitors. \u201cThings that we did 10 years ago, and everybody thought was entirely appropriate, correct, and ethical, maybe in today\u2019s value sets [people will] say, \u2018How could you do that\u2019?\u201d van Beurden told the FT in an interview last month.\n\nBut his patience seemed a little more worn out in an interview with Reuters this week. \u201cDespite what a lot of activists say, it is entirely legitimate to invest in oil and gas because the world demands it,\u201d van Beurden said. \u201cWe have no choice\u201d but to continue to spend on long-term oil and gas projects, he added. Reuters noted that the Anglo-Dutch oil giant has plans to give final investment decisions on more than 35 new oil and gas projects by 2025.", "description": "Natural Gas is coming up against increasingly strong resistance from environmental activists and the public in general, leading some to question whether it will face the same fate as coal", "authors": ["Nick Cunningham"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
