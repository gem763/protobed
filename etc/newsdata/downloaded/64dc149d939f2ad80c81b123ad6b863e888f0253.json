The term is believed to have originated in a US humour blog a few months ago. To put it simply, 'soft ghosting' is a kind of sugarcoated ghosting. To the uninitiated, ghosting occurs when you think things are going great, but the guy you have been dating online disappears from your life altogether, no explanation given. So, how does one get soft ghosted?Suppose you have been chatting with him online. He has been responding to you, but you could sense that he is an unwilling participant. But, still you are not too sure about his intentions. You keep the conversation alive, till he starts answering in monosyllables.Now comes the dreaded moment. He puts forth a 'like' emoji. You get emboldened and keep on typing messages. But that's the the last thing you receive from him. After 'liking' your message, he just falls off the face of the earth. Just radio silence. In other words, he has ghosted you, albeit gently.Just because he has liked your message, you still try to rationalise - perhaps he is busy with something or his internet connection has gone awry or maybe he has met with some emergency. You wait and wait, till you find him putting posts up on social media platforms. Wake up, you have been soft ghosted.", "description": "You have heard about ghosting. Now get ready for soft ghosting.
