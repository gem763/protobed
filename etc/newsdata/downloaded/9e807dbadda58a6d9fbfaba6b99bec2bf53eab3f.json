So happy. Really special,\" said the seven-time Tour de France competitor.\n\nBernal said he was looking forward to visiting more of Japan with his entourage.\n\n\"We've seen Tokyo and we'll be moving on to Kyoto for three days now,\" Bernal told AFP.\n\nThe 22-year-old Colombian said he had no space in his already bulging luggage for the large bags of local rice being given out as part of the prizes.\n\nAlso present at the race was Tour de France king of the mountains Romain Bardet, and his polka-dot jersey raised a cheer over the early laps as he made a point of charging ahead on the one notable incline.\n\n\"We had fun,\" said Bardet. \"We fly home tonight but I hope to be back for the Olympics in July. I rode the final part of the Olympic route, it's a good technical descent and we're looking forwards to it. There will be five of us on the French team.\"\n\nWinner of the green sprint jersey here, Italian puncher Matteo Trentin is still smarting after settling for silver at the recent world championships in Yorkshire.\n\n\"I'm just about getting over the disappointment,\" he told AFP. \"The rain there was ridiculous, I'm only just warming up,\" he said with a straight face.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Four-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome successfully completed his first competitive ride since his horror crash in June on Sunday before hot-tailing his way across Tokyo to watch the World Cup semifinal.
