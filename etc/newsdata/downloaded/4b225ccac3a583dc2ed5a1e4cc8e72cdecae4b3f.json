The new site, AppleCensorship.com, allows users to check which apps are not accessible to people in China through Apple\u2019s app store, indicating those that have been banned. It was created by researchers at GreatFire.org, an organization that monitors Chinese government internet censorship. In late 2017, Apple admitted to U.S. senators that it had removed from its app store in China more than 600 \u201cvirtual private network\u201d apps that allow users to evade censorship and online spying. But the company never disclosed which specific apps it removed \u2014 nor did it reveal other services it had pulled from its app store at the behest of China\u2019s authoritarian government. In addition to the hundreds of VPN apps, Apple is currently preventing its users in China from downloading apps from news organizations, including the New York Times, Radio Free Asia, Tibetan News, and Voice of Tibet. It is also blocking censorship circumvention tools like Tor and Psiphon; Google\u2019s search app and Google Earth; an app called Bitter Winter, which provides information about human rights and religious freedoms in China; and an app operated by the Central Tibetan Authority, which provides information about Tibetan human rights and social issues. Some bans \u2013 such as those of certain VPN apps and the Times \u2013 have received media coverage in the past, but many never generate news headlines. Charlie Smith, a co-founder of GreatFire.org, told The Intercept that the group was motivated to launch the website because \u201cApple provides little transparency into what it censors in its app store. Most developers find out their app has been censored after they see a drop in China traffic and try to figure out if there is a problem. We wanted to bring transparency to what they are censoring.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wanted to bring transparency to what they are censoring.\u201d\n\nSmith, who said that the website was still in a beta phase of early development, added that until now, it was not easy to check exactly which apps Apple had removed from its app stores in different parts of the world. For example, he said, \u201cnow we can see that the top 100 VPN apps in the U.S. app store are all not available in the China app store.\u201d The site is not able to distinguish between apps taken down due to requests from the Chinese government because they violate legal limits on free expression versus those removed because they violate other laws, such as those regulating gambling. However, it is possible to determine from the content of each app \u2013 and whether it continues to be available in the U.S. or elsewhere \u2013 the likely reason for its removal. Radio Free Asia, for instance, has been subject to censorship for decades in China. The Washington, D.C.-based organization, which is funded by the U.S. government, regularly reports on human rights abuses in China and has had its broadcasts jammed and blocked in the country since the late 1990s. That censorship has also extended to the internet \u2013 now with the support of Apple. Rohit Mahajan, a spokesman for Radio Free Asia, told The Intercept that Apple had informed the organization in December last year that one of its apps was removed from the app store in China because it did not meet \u201clegal requirements\u201d there. \u201cThere was no option to appeal, as far as we could discern,\u201d said Mahajan. Libby Liu, Radio Free Asia\u2019s president, added that \u201cshutting down avenues for credible, outside news organizations is a loss \u2013 not just for us, but for the millions who rely on our reports and updates for a different picture than what\u2019s presented in state-controlled media. I would hope that Western companies would be committed to Western values when it comes to making decisions that could impact that access.\u201d An Apple spokesperson declined to address removals of specific apps from China, but pointed to the company\u2019s app store review guidelines, which state: \u201cApps must comply with all legal requirements in any location where you make them available.\u201d The spokesperson said that Apple, in its next transparency report, is planning to release information on government requests to remove apps from its app store.", "description": "The site shows which apps \u2014 from human rights groups, the New York Times, and virtual private networks \u2014 have been removed from Apple's app store in China.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/01/apple-china-1548874162.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90&fit=crop&w=1200&h=800", "published_at": "2019-02-01"}
