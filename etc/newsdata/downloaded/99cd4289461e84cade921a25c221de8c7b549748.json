A further 31 people in the pub were injured.\n\nMore than 100 people were at the pub when the helicopter crashed as it was returning to its base on the banks of the River Clyde.\n\nOne eyewitness who gave evidence at the FAI told how the helicopter made a \u2018spluttering noise\u2019 before it fell from the sky while another said it sounded like a car stalling.\n\nAn Air Accidents Investigations Branch (AAIB) report published in 2015 found two fuel supply switches were off and the pilot did not follow emergency procedures after a fuel warning in the cockpit.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
