The 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, -3.20% fell 0.7 basis point to 2.201%.\n\nThe German 10-year government bond yield TMBMKDE-10Y, -14.47% plunged 7.3 basis points to negative 0.637%, while the 10-year Italian bond yield TMBMKIT-10Y, -19.38% fell 16 basis points to 0.823%, briefly scraping a record low of 0.79%.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving Treasurys?\n\nThe ECB spurred buying in global bond markets after the central bank cut its deposit rate by 10 basis points to a negative 0.5% as expected. More importantly, it announced it would buy $20 billion of bonds every month, despite doubts among analysts who said the possible universe of European bonds available for purchase was shrinking.\n\nA month ago, ECB policymaker Olli Rehn had suggested it would make sense for the central bank to surprise investors with an ambitious stimulus package in order to achieve its maximum impact. However, dissent with the ranks of the ECB in recent days had cast doubt on the likelihood that the central bank would resume its bond-buying operations in September.\n\nECB President Mario Draghi will speak next at a press conference at 8:30 a.m Eastern.\n\nSee: ECB cuts deposit rate, restarts bond-buying program\n\nInvestors saw some positive news on the international trade front. President Donald Trump delayed a tariff increase on around $250 billion in Chinese imports that had been originally slated to start on Oct. 1. Trump postponed the increase to Oct. 15, to avoid conflicting with the 70th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s rule.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Beijing was looking to split trade negotiations into two tracks, separating the more thornier national security issues from less contentious trade concerns, in the hopes of advancing stalled trade talks with the U.S.\n\nMarket participants will also consider an update on U.S. inflationary pressures. The U.S. consumer price data for August will be published at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, with economists surveyed by MarketWatch anticipating an increase of 0.1% for the month.\n\nWhat did market participants\u2019 say?\n\n\u201cCombining a 10 bp rate cut, providing more accommodative forward guidance, and restarting quantitative easing, the ECB has out-doved expectations,\u201d said Jon Hill, an interest-rate analyst at BMO Capital Markets.\n\n\u201cIf one of the core fundamental justifications for the backup in rates we\u2019ve seen over recent days was concern that Draghi couldn\u2019t garner support for an easier stance of monetary policy, this clears the way for a push back to range lows ahead of next week\u2019s FOMC,\u201d said Hill.", "description": "U.S. Treasury yields and European government bond yields fell sharply Thursday after the European Central Bank lowers its deposit rate and resumes its...", "authors": ["Sunny Oh"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
