It seemed par for the course, as my parents had been brought up abroad and sent home to school.\n\nI especially loved my second boarding school, an Anglo-Catholic convent in the hills behind Hastings, East Sussex.\n\nThe nuns wore blue stockings and were brainy and lovely. I was happy as a clam.\n\nJoanna Lumley: 'I\u2019d tell my younger self to concentrate. I was a show-off, a comedian and a clown'\n\nWe were very innocent teenagers. By 16, we may have kissed a boy on the cheek.\n\nIf we could, we would have all looked like Brigitte Bardot or Claudia Cardinale, with their tiny waists, stiff petticoats, cute expressions and pink lipstick.\n\nWe were besotted with the idea of riding on a Vespa, wearing silk scarves like Sophia Loren.\n\nI\u2019d tell my younger self to concentrate. I was a show-off, a comedian and a clown. We were so vague and dim about the future \u2014 when other people were revising, I drew pictures in my book. The idea of studying filled me with horror and I never wanted to go to university. I couldn\u2019t wait to get out into the world.\n\n'Playing Patsy, spanning 25 years, has been the best fun in the world. I\u2019ve always loved getting older, so being 70 is fabulous'\n\nI was already mad-keen on acting, but usually had to play the men\u2019s parts because I was tall. So when Patsy started wearing moustaches in Absolutely Fabulous, it was already second nature. I loved making people laugh.\n\nJennifer Saunders and I are as close as can be. In Ab Fab, Edina and Patsy are inseparable, and in real life \u2014 although we are grown-up women with husbands and children and are both now grandmothers \u2014 you can\u2019t put a cigarette paper between us. Playing Patsy, spanning 25 years, has been the best fun in the world.\n\nI\u2019ve always loved getting older, so being 70 is fabulous.\n\nYou never lose the little you who is within you. We are like trees \u2014 we grow more and more circles and more layers as we grow older, but inside us is always the person we were when we were tiny.\n\nTo be 70 and still working, I\u2019ve been very lucky. Mind you, I have also worked jolly hard.\n\nMy happiest day was probably my 12th birthday. It was a lovely spring day in the beautiful hills near Hastings. My parents gave me the pair of flat, cream-coloured sneakers I\u2019d always longed to have and I was in a beautiful dormitory with lots of funny people.\n\nI remember thinking: \u2018I\u2019ll remember being 12 because this is the best birthday ever.\u2019\n\nAnd I feel like I\u2019m 12 every day \u2014 it\u2019s quite wonderful.\n\nJAMIE OLIVER: You won\u2019t believe it but you\u2019re going to marry a pukka model\n\nEssex-born chef and campaigner for healthier school meals, Jamie, 44, shot to fame after The Naked Chef TV show in 1999. Now a MBE, he says:\n\nWhen I was 16, I couldn\u2019t wait to get to London and get my first job.\n\nI\u2019d had a rough time at secondary school and didn\u2019t do well. I\u2019m dyslexic. I\u2019ve always struggled with writing, and I\u2019ve never had the ability to concentrate long enough to read a narrative book: letters get mixed up.\n\nI\u2019ve never had a problem with imagination, but when I write my cookbooks, I speak into a Dictaphone and my editor takes down what I say.\n\nJamie Oliver: 'My love-life was like a bloody desert. There was nothing going on, and they were running a bloody mile, basically. I wasn\u2019t very confident; my voice shook when I talked to girls. I\u2019d like to sit down with the teenage me, have a pint and tell him to stick to his guns and trust his gut instinct'\n\nI think it\u2019s fine to tell kids you don\u2019t need to be good at everything.\n\nMost 16-year-olds aren\u2019t scared of much, and I certainly wasn\u2019t, but I did worry about not getting a bunk-up. My love-life was like a bloody desert. There was nothing going on, and they were running a bloody mile, basically.\n\nI wasn\u2019t very confident; my voice shook when I talked to girls.\n\nI\u2019d like to tell the 16-year-old me he\u2019d end up with a model \u2014 he wouldn\u2019t have believed that.\n\nActually, I\u2019d already met Jools [his future wife] by then. She\u2019d joined the sixth-form in my school, but every time I went to talk to her, I just sounded like Scooby-Doo. So I just sort of avoided her.\n\nA year and a half later, she had a change of heart and decided she quite liked me. I was all over it like a rash \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to miss that opportunity. But when I asked her out, I still sounded like Scooby-Doo. She didn\u2019t understand me but laughed and said: \u2018Yes, to whatever it is you just said.\u2019\n\nI\u2019d like to sit down with the teenage me, have a pint and tell him to stick to his guns and trust his gut instinct.\n\nWhen I was young I just wanted to cook, run a nice little pub in the country and have a nice wine cellar and good local beers. That\u2019s all I dreamed of. The idea of five kids would scare the life out of the younger me. I only ever saw myself having two.\n\nI\u2019ve had a fast, mad life. If I could go back, I\u2019d take more time to enjoy that time when we had no ties, no responsibilities and no baggage; those weekends when we could just be selfish and have a conversation without being interrupted a million times.\n\nOLIVIA COLMAN: You have to eat \u2014 the dark moods will pass\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress of The Favourite and TV\u2019s Broadchurch, 45, says:\n\nBoys were my main preoccupation when I was 16. I was fairly successful with them, against the odds.\n\nIn a room full of girls, I\u2019m not sure they would have pointed me out, but I always got on well with them and I think they thought I was fun to be with. I was low-maintenance and low-drama.\n\nI was never very good at school and used to dread going. It never came easy for me; I always felt there must be something else.\n\nOlivia Colman: 'As I\u2019ve grown up, I know when there\u2019s a black fug coming and that it\u2019ll pass. It would be nice to go back to those early fugs and tell my younger self: \"You\u2019ll be OK. This will pass. And you will be loved\"'\n\nThen, at 16, I did my first school play \u2014 I was Jean Brodie in The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie \u2014 and I immediately thought: \u2018This is what I want to do. I don\u2019t want to do anything else.\u2019 And that was lucky, because I\u2019m not qualified to do anything else.\n\nI was a fairly jolly teenager, but even the most sane people go slightly nuts when their hormones are flying about.\n\nThere was a time when I had a problem with not eating and was struggling with body confidence. But I kept smiling at everyone. I had black clouds, and I still do.\n\nAs I\u2019ve grown up, I know when there\u2019s a black fug coming and that it\u2019ll pass. It would be nice to go back to those early fugs and tell my younger self: \u2018You\u2019ll be OK. This will pass. And you will be loved. Don\u2019t make any rash decisions in this moment. You can make the world work and have a brilliant time.\u2019\n\nI\u2019m basically a pretty upbeat person. I always desperately wanted to be a mum. I wouldn\u2019t tell my younger self about anything that will happen to her \u2014 if I told her she was going to achieve her dream, she\u2019d stop trying.\n\nI\u2019ve always been in touch with my emotions; I\u2019d be the one sobbing in the cinema. But when I had children, it took away my skin completely. So now, at the hint of feeling something, I\u2019ll be crying on the bus. I have no armour at all.\n\nMaking Broadchurch for ITV, I couldn\u2019t stop crying. It\u2019s just awful, the idea that your children could go before you.\n\nI\u2019d have a scene and they\u2019d say: \u2018You\u2019re not crying in this scene.\u2019 And I\u2019d think: \u2018Yeah, right \u2014 good luck with that.\u2019\n\nOZZY OSBOURNE: Stop burgling houses\n\nOzzy Osbourne, former lead singer of heavy metal band Black Sabbath, 70, says:\n\nI was a rebellious kid; I didn\u2019t like commitment and I couldn\u2019t hold a job down. I was always being yelled at by my mother for not bringing any money into the house. I was a bit of a drifter.\n\nI left home but didn\u2019t really have anywhere to go. I used to doss around on people\u2019s couches. I was a bit of a social butterfly in a working-class environment.\n\nI tried to find things I was good at. I tried burglary, but I was no good at that: it was less than three weeks before I got caught. Then I didn\u2019t pay my fine and I got put in jail for a few weeks. That was a short, sharp lesson.\n\nOzzy Osbourne: 'If I could live one day of my life again, it would be the day I got married to Sharon. I was off my face all day and didn\u2019t make it to the bedroom suite. In the end, they found me face-down in the hotel corridor, unconscious. I\u2019d like to go back to that day and end it by going to bed with my wife'\n\nIf my father hadn\u2019t bought me a microphone when I was 18, I wouldn\u2019t be here now.\n\nHe saw that I was really interested in music so he bought it for me, and it was shortly after that I met the guys who would become Black Sabbath. It was the fact that I had my own microphone and PA system that got me in the band.\n\nLooking back, I feel very lucky. I\u2019m 70 and I\u2019ve had a great life. I still do stupid things, but I don\u2019t get in my car drunk any more. The last time I got loaded I came back minus a Ferrari.\n\nIf I could live one day of my life again, it would be the day I got married to Sharon. I was off my face all day and didn\u2019t make it to the bedroom suite.\n\nIn the end, they found me face-down in the hotel corridor, unconscious. I\u2019d like to go back to that day and end it by going to bed with my wife.\n\nROD STEWART: You\u2019re born to be a show-off\n\nSir Rod Stewart, 74, is one of the best-selling musicians of all time. The three-times-married father of eight says:\n\nI\u2019d left school by the time I was 16. My dad got me a job in Kentish Town working as a screen printer, printing wallpapers. But I was a very unhappy screen printer.\n\nAround the same time, I lost my virginity, hence the song Maggie May, which is all about that. At 16, I was quite shy with women, believe it or not. I still am.\n\nIf you met the teenage Rod now, you\u2019d probably think he was a cocky b*****d and that he liked himself too much.\n\nRod Stewart: 'If I could go back to one moment in my life, it would probably be when I was in The Faces. I was driving towards Swiss Cottage in London, and the BBC came on and told me Maggie May was No 1. I turned the car round, went to my mum and dad\u2019s council house in Highgate, walked through the door and told them. We all had a big hug and we all cried. Then I said: \u2018Well, I\u2019ve got to go now. I\u2019m meeting some friends,\u2019 and off I went'\n\nThe idea of being splashed all over the tabloids for years, that wouldn\u2019t bother the young Rod \u2014 he\u2019d love the thought of all that attention.\n\nHe was born to be a show-off. With a nose and haircut like that, there was nothing he could have been but a rock star.\n\nIf I could go back to one moment in my life, it would probably be when I was in The Faces.\n\nI was driving an old Rolls-Royce and heading to Swiss Cottage in London, and the BBC came on and told me Maggie May was No 1. I turned the car round, went to my mum and dad\u2019s council house in Highgate, walked through the door and told them.\n\nWe all had a big hug and we all cried. Then I said: \u2018Well, I\u2019ve got to go now. I\u2019m meeting some friends,\u2019 and off I went.\n\nThat was probably the most joyous moment I\u2019ve ever had. But trust me, I\u2019ve had many, many others.\n\nLetter To My Younger Self, by Jane Graham, is published by Blink, \u00a316.99. \u00a9 Jane Graham.
