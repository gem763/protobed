The elections for the post of office bearers are scheduled to be held this month. However, prior to the forthcoming election, erstwhile power brokers in Indian cricket administration have managed to get people perceived as their \u201cproxies\u201d elected to posts in state cricket administrations. This has led to dismay in some quarters and is being interpreted as a failure of the administrative reforms ushered in over the last three years by the Supreme Court.\n\nThis interpretation misses the wood for the trees. The Supreme Court\u2019s reform attempt has gone through a few iterations; the apex court modified some early suggestions in the interests of pragmatism. Also, the new administration, or the apex council, which will govern the game in India, will have new faces. For the first time two representatives of players, a former male and female cricketer, and a representative of the Comptroller and Auditor General will be a part of the governing council. This is in addition to former national players such as Ganguly who have been elected to office. Separately, an ethics officer has been functioning and examining complaints pertaining to conflict of interest.\n\nThese structural changes are likely to make for a better and more transparent administration. These are the real reforms we should focus on. Even \u201cproxies\u201d have to function within this framework.\n\nRead also: Amid drama, ex-India captain Sourav Ganguly all set to be president of BCCI\n\nRead also: Taking over at a time when BCCI\u2019s image has taken a hit, says Sourav Ganguly", "description": "Former Indian cricket captain Sourav Ganguly is, according to media reports, likely to become the new president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India.
