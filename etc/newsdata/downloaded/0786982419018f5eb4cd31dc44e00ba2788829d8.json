Housing prices in the area have surged since the announcement in November of Amazon\u2019s arrival. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nThousands of job-seekers are expected to swarm the site of Amazon\u2019s future headquarters at a \u201ccareer day\u201d in Crystal City on Tuesday, as the online retail giant begins to accelerate its hiring and presence in Northern Virginia.\n\nThe company, which chose the site in Arlington County from among 238 contenders across the country, will not hire anyone on the spot, an Amazon spokesman said, but with the intention of filling 400 jobs by year\u2019s end, the event is an opportunity for candidates to learn about which departments will be hiring and the company\u2019s culture, from its internal \u201cuniversity\u201d to its many employee groups.\n\nMore than 60 new and transferred Amazon employees are already working in the company\u2019s temporary headquarters at 2345 Crystal City Dr., filling jobs such as recruiting manager, project manager, software developer, account representative and technical business developer.\n\nAbout 170 new jobs are open, and more openings are being added every day to reach Amazon\u2019s goal of hiring 400 people in Arlington by the end of the year. The fastest-hiring divisions are Amazon Web Services, those that handle its devices such as Alexa, consumer retail sales and its human resources team.\n\n(Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\n[Amazon says it will avoid HQ2 housing crunch by better planning]\n\nNew hires will be working at a retrofitted 88,000-square-foot building at 241 18th St. South at the end of September, with room for more than 450 people. A building at 1800 Bell St. is expected to be ready for occupancy by the end of this year.\n\nThe company\u2019s main headquarters buildings, in nearby Pentagon City, are undergoing the county\u2019s site review process, and Amazon hopes to begin construction in the first quarter of 2020, barring delays. Renderings of those structures will be on display at Tuesday\u2019s event.\n\nThe career day, under a tent at the Grounds in Crystal City, is the first of its kind for the company, Amazon said. Similar events are being held in Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Nashville and Seattle.\n\nThe company has some 30,000 open positions across the United States, from warehouse jobs to top positions in software development. The Arlington event will be capped by \u201cfireside chats\u201d with several company vice presidents, who will discuss their internal businesses within Amazon.\n\n[Virginia House approves $750 million in Amazon subsidies after 9 minutes of debate]\n\nAmazon\u2019s arrival in Arlington excited many economic analysts, government officials and business owners, as well as real estate agents and homeowners who expect higher property values thanks to their proximity to the new development. Amazon plans to hire 25,000 workers with annual salaries of $150,000 over the next decade, according to its deal with the state of Virginia. In exchange, Amazon will receive incentives worth $750 million.\n\nSkeptics, however, worry that the arrival of so many highly paid workers will cause housing prices to skyrocket, pushing out low-income and working-class families. Housing prices have spiked since November\u2019s announcement of Amazon\u2019s plan to build its second headquarters, or HQ2, in the Washington region, although subsequent studies indicate that so far, speculators and existing residents are fueling the real estate frenzy.\n\nThe Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments is urging local governments to commit to increase the amount of low- and medium-cost housing in the region by 320,000 housing units between 2020 and 2030. Amazon has donated $3 million for affordable housing projects and has said it is not finished with its local philanthropic efforts.\n\n[Region\u2019s elected officials urge their governments to commit to affordable-housing targets]\n\nAmazon already has about 10,000 employees in Virginia, working in its fulfillment centers, Prime Now hubs, pop-up stores, solar farms and Whole Foods grocery stores.\n\nThe Amazon job fair runs 11:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Tuesday at the Grounds in Crystal City, 1102 S. Eads St.\n\nRead more:\n\nAmazon drops plan to build HQ2 in New York\n\nAmazon in Seattle: Economic godsend or self-centered behemoth?\n\nArlington County approves $23 million in incentives for Amazon", "description": "The company releases more details of job openings and building plans for its HQ2.", "authors": ["Patricia Sullivan", "Reporter Covering Government", "Politics", "Other Regional Issues In Arlington County", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/u5FAt-jcuhmD1wq6YNF2n-fMLdY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EAZKAGUNMYI6TNXUAMZVMUBNZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
