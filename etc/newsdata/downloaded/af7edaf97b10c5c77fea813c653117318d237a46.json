just a week after Brexit.\n\nThe Prime Minister gave Chancellor Sajid Javid the go ahead for a full blown financial statement on November 6.\n\nThe bullish announcement comes despite debate still raging over whether the UK will secure a Brexit deal with the EU before the deadline.\n\nMr Johnson has refused to say he will delay the October 31 date if there\u2019s no deal - despite a law commanding he asks for a three-month delay.\n\nMr Javid said: \u201cThis will be the first Budget after leaving the EU.\n\n(Image: IAN VOGLER/DAILY MIRROR)\n\n\"I will be setting out our plan to shape the economy for the future and triggering the start of our infrastructure revolution.\n\n\u201cThis is the right and responsible thing to do \u2013 we must get on with governing.\u201d\n\nThe announcement came just hours before the first Queen's Speech of Mr Johnson's premiership on Monday.\n\nBuckingham Palace demanded a copy of the speech a week early after trust hit \"rock bottom\", it was reported.\n\nThe Prime Minister is making law order and immigration measures the centre of the speech in what he says is a bid to \"restore confidence\" in the justice system.\n\nA package of 22 bills will include legislation to keep serious criminals in prison for longer, hand out tougher sentences on foreign offenders who return to the UK, and offer better protection for domestic abuse victims.\n\nMr Johnson's plan to offer preferential treatment to migrants who agree to live in the North of England has been branded \u201cconfused\u201d and an unworkable \u201cgimmick\u201d.\n\nThe Government wants to introduce an Australia-style points-based system, which Ukip has previously backed.\n\nMr Johnson will also pledge to invest in the NHS, increase the national living wage to \u00a310.50 an hour and strengthen environmental protections.\n\nMinisters are preparing to rush through a bill to ratify any Brexit deal that Mr Johnson is able to agree this week in Brussels in time for Britain to leave on the EU on Halloween.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nHowever, with no Commons majority, it is questionable how much, if any, of the proposed legislation ministers can get through Parliament before a general election.\n\nLabour has dismissed the decision to hold a Queen's Speech before the Government goes to the country as a \"cynical stunt\" intended to lay the ground for an election.\n\nShadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: \"This Queen's Speech is farcical.\n\n\"It is just an uncosted wish list which the Government has no intention and no means to deliver, and nothing more than a pre-election party political broadcast.\"\n\nThe law and order package includes a bill to \"drastically\" increase the sentences for foreign criminals who return to the UK in breach of a deportation order, a move ministers say will help disrupt the activities of international crime gangs.\n\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said: \"We have been a soft touch on foreign criminals for too long.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\"The sentence for breaching a deportation order is far too low at the moment and many criminals conclude that it's worth trying to get back in the country when all you get is a slap on the wrist.\n\n\"Deterring foreign criminals from re-entering the country and putting those that do behind bars for longer will make our country safer.\"\n\nThere will be legislation making it easier for police to arrest internationally wanted fugitives who are the subject of an Interpol Red notice without the need to apply for a UK arrest warrant, a process that can take a minimum of six to eight hours.\n\nInitially it will only apply to those issued by a limited number of countries with trusted justice systems, the other members of the Five Eyes intelligence group, the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, and two non-EU European states, Switzerland and Liechtenstein.\n\nHowever the Government will be able to add other countries by statutory instrument.\n\nOn sentencing there will be a bill to enact plans to abolish the automatic half-way release for the most serious offenders who currently receive standard-fixed term sentences including those jailed for rape, manslaughter and grievous bodily harm.\n\nThere will be a \"Helen's Law\" bill, named after 22-year-old Helen McCourt who was murdered in 1988, to deny parole to murderers who withhold information about their victims.\n\nThe Government will also bring back the Domestic Abuse Bill which fell as a result of Mr Johnson's unlawful suspension of Parliament last month.\n\nOn Sunday, the BBC's Andrew Marr told off Mrs Patel as he accused her of \u201claughing\u201d on his programme when he asked about businesses' fears over no-deal Brexit.\n\nHe told the Home Secretary: \"I can\u2019t see why you\u2019re laughing.\"", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has given Chancellor Sajid Javid the go ahead for a full blown financial statement on November 6", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Gavin Cordon", "Chris Kitching", "Image", "Ian Vogler Daily Mirror", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19338395.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_IVM_MDM_0392019_voglerjpg01JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
