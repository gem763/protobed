It's just going to be a long day,\" Woods told ESPN. \"Eat a lot of food tonight and then tomorrow, same thing, make sure that I eat enough and feel good about my warm-up session. I felt like I hit it a little bit better today, which is nice. That's nice going into a long day like tomorrow, because it's going to be a bit of a test physically and mentally to play for, what, up to 10 hours. So it's going to be a long day.\"\n\nThomas tweeted about the Domino's experience, saying, \"What a day for the books...Walked to dominoes with the guys, made our way home 2 hours later, treatment again, now back in my hotel room.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWoods will tee off with Gary Woodland and Keegan Bradley at 8:30 a.m. local time (7:30 p.m. ET Saturday).", "description": "Tiger Woods and some of golf's biggest stars ended up being stuck at a Dominos Pizza in Japan for about 90 minutes on Friday after powerful storms made roads undrivable.", "authors": ["David Aaro", "David Aaro Is A Freelance Reporter At Fox News Digital Based In New York City."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/tiger-woods-dominos-AP-Dominos.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
