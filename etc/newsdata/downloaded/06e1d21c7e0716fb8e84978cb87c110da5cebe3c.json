For January-September were down about 8% from the same period in 2018.\n\nThe weak data will disappoint the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which cut interest rates for a third time this year on Tuesday to a record low of 0.75% in an effort to revive employment growth, consumer spending and inflation.\n\nThe June and July cuts led banks to reduce mortgage rates, lifting the housing market out of its doldrums. But there have been few signs so far that those cuts boosted other businesses.\n\nIn a statement, FCAI chief executive Tony Weber said slower car sales are \u201cin line with the broader economic environment in Australia\u201d while also noting stringent lending standards as a factor.\n\n\u201cOf particular concern to the industry is the restrictive regulatory lending conditions currently facing consumers,\u201d he said.\n\nWeber also said sales figures raise the question of whether \u201cwe have made it too difficult for people to finance basic purchases\u201d.\n\nAnnual loan growth in Australia fell to an eight-year low of 2.9% in August and total credit card debt was the lowest level in nine years.\n\n\u201cResponsible lending\u201d has become a significant issue in recent days with the government as well as the RBA governor urging banks to loosen their purse strings.\n\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg told a property forum in Sydney that a balance needs to be struck while making loans as an \u201cunduly restrictive application of these obligations can do as much harm as an overly lax one.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is in everyone\u2019s interest that the aspirations of hard working families are not collateral damage in this regulatory process,\u201d he added.\n\nThursday\u2019s data showed Toyota (7203.T) held its top spot in the Australian car market with a 17.2% share followed by Mitsubishi (8058.T) at 10.2% and Mazda (7261.T) at 9.3%.", "description": "New car sales in Australia fell for the 18th consecutive month in September, suggesting back-to-back interest rate cuts in June and July had failed to lift consumer spending as banks contain their lending.", "authors": ["Swati Pandey", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
