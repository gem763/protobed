But the Facebook CEO would not commit to waiting until Congress developed new laws for cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether dropped 10 per cent or more on Wednesday during the testimony; trading volumes have been low amid regulatory scrutiny of Libra. (The Logic, Bloomberg)\n\nTalking point: Facebook\u2019s commitment to getting regulatory approval has been its executives\u2019 main defence against concerns about money laundering and Libra\u2019s impacts on the global financial system. But Wednesday\u2019s hearing suggested it will face significant hurdles. Some committee members noted that U.S. financial statutes are outdated, and were not originally written to regulate digital currencies. Other committee members said regulators are concerned they cannot monitor or police Libra. Zuckerberg introduced a new wrinkle by nodding to the independence of the Libra Association, where Facebook is theoretically just one of 21 votes. For example, he promised Wednesday that his firm would follow customer identification rules for its Calibra cryptocurrency wallet, but said he couldn\u2019t make the same commitment for other organization members. As Rep. Brad Sherman then pointed out, Libra\u2019s foundational white paper specifically allows for pseudonymous use.", "description": "", "authors": ["Murad Hemmadi"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
