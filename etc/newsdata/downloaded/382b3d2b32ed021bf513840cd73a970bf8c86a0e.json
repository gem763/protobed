The black and white print got a modern spin this year at shows like Area, Chanel and Prabal Gurung, and frankly, it's come a long way. Many say houndstooth, which gets its name for its close resemblance to dogs' teeth, has its roots in 1800s Scotland, while others reach further back and point to an ancient cloak found in Sweden as the earliest example of the pattern. It became popular in the West in the 1930s, and Christian Dior famously incorporated the print into the brand's suit sets in the 1950s. Ever since, it's been in and out of style. Luckily for all of us, houndstooth is back for fall 2019. This season, new takes on the trend make for strong style statements.
