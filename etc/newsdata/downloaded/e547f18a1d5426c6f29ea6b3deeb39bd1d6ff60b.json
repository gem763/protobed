They use our turbine technology and then they buy the controls and software over and over again. We think our model is kind of similar to Intel (INTC) and Microsoft (MSFT) for wind turbines.\"\n\nHe added that his company has been able to cash in on Navy contracts as military spending under President Trump and expects that revenue stream to sustain as the Navy outfits its fleet.\n\nBig Trouble in Little China\n\nYet, one issue that was not able to escape secular trends and has shown the other side of the political coin in contrast to the military spending, is the Sino-American trade war. The impact of the spat has impacted nearly every industry, especially tech.\n\nThe pain in markets has left investment officials calling for at least a tepid solution in the near term.\n\n\"There is pressure on the U.S. and Chinese governments to find a solution,\" Wilmington Trust CIO Tony Roth told TheStreet. \"That doesn't mean it has to be an overly substantive solution, but it needs to allow both sides to say they've reached a deal and walk away from the deal.\n\nHe indicated that even a non-substantive deal would suffice for investor sentiment in the shorter term. That view was certainly vindicated by the afternoon trading reaction.\n\nThat isn't enough for AMSC Daniel McGahn, a company that recently won an intellectual property dispute with Chinese wind energy provider Sinovel Wind Group.\n\n\"We had pretty large cases over in China,\" he explained. \"We're probably unique in that we've actually won an IP case with China.\"\n\nMcGahn explained that a substantive solution is paramount moving forward.\n\n\"I think it's clear that the climate has to change,\" he said. \"There has to be repercussions for actions...there really needs to be better safeguards and protection to keep the IP sacrosanct.\"\n\nTo hear McGahn's full comments, check out the interview above.\n\nMicrosoft is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS member club.
