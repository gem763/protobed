AirAsia X introduced a \"Quiet Zone\" on all of its flights in 2017, which is comprised of eight rows that cannot be occupied by children under the age of 10.\n\nBudget Indian carrier IndiGo introduced a similar measure in 2016, branding its premium extra leg room zones \"quiet zones\" and barring them from being occupied by passengers younger than 12.\n\nSeveral airlines, including Air New Zealand and Qantas display bassinets on seat maps for selected flights to help parents traveling with infants select the right seats, which can also help fellow passengers see where babies might be on the plane.", "description": "Japan Airlines has introduced a new feature on its booking system to tell passengers where young children will be seated during their flight.", "authors": ["Chloe Taylor"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/101257437-200506280-001.jpg?v=1532564570", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
