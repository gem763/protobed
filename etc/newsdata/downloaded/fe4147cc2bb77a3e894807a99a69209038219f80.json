The labor contract was reached between union and company negotiators on Oct. 16, but strikers remained on the picket lines until it was ratified.\n\nGM plants will resume work as soon as possible, with some workers returning over the weekend and others on Monday, according to two company sources familiar with plans.\n\nThe strike by nearly 50,000 hourly GM workers started Sept. 16, nearly six weeks ago. It is the largest against a US business since the last GM strike 12 years ago. But that strike was over in less than three days. This strike is the longest auto industry work stoppage in more than 20 years, and the longest nationwide auto strike in 50 years. GM has lost about $1.75 billion due to the walkout, according to an estimate from Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan research firm.\n\nThe deal was reached between union and company negotiators more than a week ago, although members stayed on the picket line until the ratification process could be completed.\n\nRead More", "description": "The long General Motors strike is finally over, as members of the United Auto Workers union voted in favor of a four-year labor deal to end the walkout.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore", "Vanessa Yurkevich", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191025072611-01-gm-strike-1023-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
