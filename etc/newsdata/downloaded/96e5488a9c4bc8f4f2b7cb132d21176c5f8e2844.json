Dreyfus recently met Premier Dan Andrews, presumably to discuss the role \u2013 certainly not to talk level crossings in Edithvale, given the local member actually lives in Malvern.\n\nSuch an appointment would undermine the judiciary\u2019s independence and damage the court, but wouldn\u2019t its loss be our gain?! As a young QC in 2005, Dreyfus sought the same gig but was overlooked for Maxwell by Steve Bracks\u2019 attorney-general Rob Hulls. That left the pompous, unexceptional silk to pursue jurisprudential glory via Canberra, deposing sitting MP Ann Corcoran in 2007 before spending an entire seven months in 2013 as the nation\u2019s first law officer. He now serves on the opposition\u2019s House tactics team as its unwitting devil\u2019s advocate.\n\nBefore Bill Shorten\u2019s shock defeat at May\u2019s federal poll, Dreyfus was set to return as Commonwealth attorney-general, then join the High Court on the occasion of a vacancy (likely the retirement of Justice Geoffrey Nettle in December 2020), despite his ceaseless bellyaching about the Administrative Appeals Tribunal being \u201cfull of Liberal mates\u201d and his unironic pledge to \u201crestore a transparent merits-based policy to judicial appointments\u201d. Dreyfus\u2019 pungent ambition is only casually tethered to his sufferability; indeed, the two may be inversely proportionate.\n\nDreyfus also threatened to resign in 2016 if Kimberley Kitching was selected to fill Stephen Conroy\u2019s vacancy in the Senate. She was, but cruelly, he didn\u2019t.\n\nDreyfus wants the ALP\u2019s unsuccessful Higgins candidate (and another barrister) Fiona McLeod to replace him in Isaacs, presumably so its parliamentary representative can continue admiring it from afar. Suffice it to say the Right will have something to say about that.\n\nWith a 6.4 per cent margin, and a profile too suburban for the Greens, the by-election promises to be uneventful, even though the government will control its timing.", "description": "The shadow attorney-general is set to quit parliament to lead Victoria's Court of Appeal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4409%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_526%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7199c0a5395755d5794e37de73b10e4973ed5db5", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
