The party has since condemned the attack in a statement saying that Sink\u00e9 had been removed from the party for \"speech judged contrary to the spirit and the political line of the National Rally\" and \"had since not participated in any action of the movement.\"\n\nThe attack occurred amid French Senate debates over proposed and controversial legislation forbidding women from wearing hijabs when accompanying their children on school field trips.\n\nThe bill was submitted days after a mother on a school trip to a local assembly was asked by a council member from Le Pen\u2019s party to remove her hijab.\n\nGaizka Iroz/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe French Council of the Muslim Faith denounced the proposed ban in a statement on Tuesday. The organization, which includes representatives of Muslim federations across France, linked the Bayonne mosque attack and \"outrageous remarks\" from politicians and media personalities who \"trivialize the hatred of Muslims.\"\n\nSink\u00e9 reportedly poured gasoline on the mosque\u2019s main door and set it on fire on Monday. The shooting victims include a 78-year-old man and a 74-year-old man who was sitting in a car. Sink\u00e9 reportedly poured gasoline on the car and lit it on fire with the victim still inside.\n\nAt 3:30 p.m., French police arrested Sink\u00e9 at his home in Saint-Martin-de-Seignanx, 15 kilometers north of Bayonne.\n\nPolice discovered grenades, an automatic pistol, several cartridges and a shotgun in Sink\u00e9's home.\n\n\u201cThere are questions regarding his mental health and a psych evaluation of the suspect is underway,\u201d said Mariee at the press conference.\n\nThe two victims are in stable condition, according to authorities. The local Muslim community is using a space loaned by the mayor of Bayonne, according to local reports.", "description": "The 84-year-old confessed to police and spoke about avenging the destruction of the historic cathedral.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/mosque-1-gty-er-191029_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
