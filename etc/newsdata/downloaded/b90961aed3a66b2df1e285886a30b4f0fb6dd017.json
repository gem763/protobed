All in the name of good earth stewardship.\n\nAnd the left is simply buzzing with admiration over this child.\n\nBut then again, they don\u2019t have to live with her.\n\nThunberg, bless her heart, must be a real saint to live with \u2014 and yes, that\u2019s the Southern meaning of \u201cbless her heart.\u201d This is how kids act when they aren\u2019t given solid parental guidance, proper education and a humble sense of who they are in God. They think they\u2019re entitled to speak on issues of which they\u2019re completely uninformed, and that the world, simply because they feel sad, or angry \u2014 or simply because they feel something at all \u2014 owes them a listen. And a serious response.\n\nThunberg, along with 15 of friends, ranging in ages from 8 to 17, filed a complaint with the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child accusing Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Germany and France of failing to keep their climate change obligations. Nary a word about China. But plenty of finger-wagging and scolding and high falutin\u2019-ism over her rights as a child of the world being violated, as per the United Nations\u2019 very own Convention on the Rights of the Child.\n\n\u201cChange needs to happen now,\u201d Thunberg said in a widely reported statement. \u201cThe climate crisis is not just the weather. It means also lack of food and lack of water, places that are unlivable and refugees because of it. It is scary.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s tame compared to what she said at the United Nations.\n\n\u201cRight here, right now is where we draw the line,\u201d Thunberg said. \u201cThe world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not.\u201d\n\nAnother excerpt?\n\n\u201cWe are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is the money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth,\u201d she said. \u201cHow dare you. \u2026 How dare you \u2026\u201d\n\nHow dare you.\n\nHow dare you.\n\nYou know, it\u2019s one thing for teenagers to take an interest in the world of politics and current events. It\u2019s another thing entirely to pretend, as a teen, to possess the wisdom and knowledge to lead the world. One is laudable; the other is pretentious and obnoxious. The other is a tool of the left.\n\nIn another day, a better time, Thunberg\u2019s parents would\u2019ve taught her the difference. And she wouldn\u2019t have gotten away with standing atop the global stage and lecturing the adults on how to behave.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
