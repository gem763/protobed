He resigned from his unpaid U.S. Department of State post last Friday without providing an explanation. Volker stepped down amid the impeachment inquiry launched by House Democrats.\n\nIn a statement issued while Volker testified, Congressman Mike Turner (R-OH), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, declared:\n\nIt is deeply unfortunate and regrettable that Schiff\u2019s show trial investigation has clearly affected Volker\u2019s ability to advance U.S. interests with Ukraine. It is my strong belief that Volker would not have been involved in nor permitted anything inappropriate, let alone illegal, in his service to our country. Today he continued his legacy of integrity under questioning from Schiff\u2019s staff. I do not believe that Volker\u2019s testimony advanced Schiff\u2019s impeachment agenda.\n\nComments by other GOP House members and sources cited by members of the media echo Turner\u2019s sentiment.\n\nAn official familiar with the testimony of State Dept. official Kurt Volker describes the testimony as a \u201csetback\u201d for Schiff\u2019s impeachment efforts. So far, Volker\u2019s testimony \u201cdoes nothing to advance Chairman Schiff\u2019s theory of the case,\u201d the official says. \u2014 Sean Davis (@seanmdav) October 3, 2019\n\nNEW: per a source with knowledge of ongoing #Volker interview:\n\n\"The information provided by Amb. Volker so far does nothing to advance @RepAdamSchiff theory of the case. Volker's testimony seems to be a disappointing event \u2013and likely a setback\u2013for the #impeachment effort.\" \u2014 Brooke Singman (@brookefoxnews) October 3, 2019\n\nThe Washington Times reports:\n\nReps. Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan and Lee Zeldin took a break from the interview [with Volker] to tell reporters Mr. Volker\u2019s testimony didn\u2019t match up with the \u201cnarrative\u201d coming from the pro-impeachment camp. \u201cMr. Volker has been very impressive \u2026 and has said nothing \u2014 nothing \u2014 that coincides with what the Democrats are saying,\u201d Mr. Jordan, Ohio Republican, said. \u2026 Democrats, meanwhile, remained mum as they emerged from the room where Mr. Volker had been testifying behind closed doors.\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Meadows reportedly \u201csounded optimistic.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think anytime you can get clarity to what actually happened is a good day for Americans. And we\u2019re getting more clarity,\u201d he proclaimed, according to the Times.\n\nVolker resigned last week after State confirmed that the former official linked Rudolph Giuliani, the president\u2019s private lawyer, with a top presidential adviser. Giuliani has conceded himself he frequently met with Volker.\n\nRoll Call notes:\n\nHouse Republicans on Thursday criticized Intelligence Chairman Adam B. Schiff\u2019s handling of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump while defending the man the committee\u2019s staff questioned behind closed doors in connection to the probe.\n\nAs Volker testified, Congressman Jordan reportedly criticized Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) for attempting to block some members from participating in the former official\u2019s interview.\n\nSchiff, who is leading the Democrats\u2019 impeachment effort, serves as the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nJordan, the founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, also accused Schiff of preventing State Department lawyers from playing a role in the closed briefing, Roll Call points out.\n\n\u201cIf this is how Mr. Schiff is going to conduct these types of interviews in the future, that\u2019s a concern,\u201d Jordan said.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry centers around allegations by an intelligence community \u201cwhistleblower\u201d that Trump used his position to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter\u2019s links to a suspected criminal, allegedly threatening to withhold foreign aid.", "description": "Kurt Volker testimony did not advance the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Report-on-Volker-Testimony-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
