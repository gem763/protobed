(Mike Maguire/Flickr)\n\nHigh temperatures rose to right around 70 on what was a beautiful day across the region. Some high clouds filtering in from the west join forces with a flow off the ocean tonight to turn our skies rather cloudy. Once clouds arrive, it stays pretty gray into Tuesday.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough tonight: It\u2019s a pleasant and mainly clear evening, but clouds increase with time. Some patchy fog or drizzle may form after midnight in spots, especially east and in northeastern parts of the area. Lows are mainly in the upper 40s and lower 50s, which could be mid-50s in the city. Winds are out of the east-southeast around 5 mph.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Tuesday): With a wind off the ocean continuing, we see a rather cloudy morning. Some patchy fog or drizzle remains possible into midday, again mainly east and northeast of town. After that, clouds lift and break somewhat, but we tend to stay mostly to partly cloudy at best. Temperatures reach the mid-60s in most spots, with some upper 60s mixed in. Winds are out of the east and southeast around 5 to 10 mph.\n\nSee Jason Samenow\u2019s forecast through the weekend.

(Prism Climate Group)\n\nFrom famine to feast: Rain was hard to come by for a long while, and we drifted deeper into drought as October began. The back half of the month has been legitimately wet. Sunday was the third day since then that at least one inch of rain has fallen. Only one year in the record, 1937, has seen more, with four. 2007 also picked up three such days. With 5.01 inches of rain since Oct. 16, it\u2019s also the seventh-wettest back half of October on record. And with more rain to come, we should climb a bit higher on that list.\n\nWant our 5 a.m. forecast delivered to your email inbox?
