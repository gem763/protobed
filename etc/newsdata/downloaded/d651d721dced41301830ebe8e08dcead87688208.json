Millions of Guns Change Hands That Way, Experts Say", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-04", "text": "Reports say that the gunman who murdered seven people in a mass shooting in Odessa, Texas, on Saturday, legally never should have been able to buy a gun. But after reportedly failing a federal background check, he managed to get ahold of a gun anyway by purchasing it from a private seller.\n\nSome experts say that this case shows that private sales are a \u201cgaping loophole\u201d in the background check law, which must be closed to reduce gun violence.\n\nAbout 22 percent of gun owners in the United States report obtaining their most recent firearm in the last two years without a background check\u2014which means millions of guns are exchanged this way each year.\n\nThe question of expanding federal background checks has taken on increased urgency over the last year. The House of Representatives passed an expanded background check bill earlier this year. President Donald Trump has gone back and forth on background checks. After shootings in Dayton, Ohio and El Paso, Texas last month, he has expressed willingness to support expanding the law, but on Sunday he said that the measure wouldn\u2019t have stopped most shootings.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

As California Rep. Adam Schiff, a Democrat, tweeted after the shooting, \u201cCould there be a more compelling case for why we need universal background checks?\u201d\n\nNot all legislators were convinced that the Odessa shooting should be interpreted in this way. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, a Texas Republican who has voted against universal background checks, responded to Schiff\u2019s tweet that the expanded law would only have prevented the shooting if the law had been \u201cself-enforce[d].\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the first mass shooting where a universal background check *possibly* would have prevented him from having a gun, if and only if, they decided to self-enforce that law. Guys who shoot cops tend not to self-enforce laws. And we don\u2019t make sweeping policy on one situation,\u201d Crenshaw wrote on Twitter.\n\nGun violence experts, meanwhile, say that while closing background check loopholes won\u2019t prevent every mass shooting, expanding the law is an essential component of keeping guns away from people who are potentially dangerous.\n\nAccording to Dr. Garen Wintemute, the director of U.C. Davis\u2019s Violence Prevention Research Program, closing the private sales loophole would make it more difficult for criminals to avoid creating a paper trail or for a prohibit a banned person from buying a firearm. Otherwise, Wintemute says, there\u2019s little to prevent people from selling guns to people that they don\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only a crime for the seller to sell to me, a prohibited person, if \u2013 to use the exact words- \u2018they know or have reasonable cause to believe\u201d that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Wintemute says. \u201cWhat extending background checks to private party sales does is make the operations of the criminal market much less efficient.\u201d\n\nDr. Michael Siegel, a professor at Boston University School of Public Health, says that the idea that laws don\u2019t matter makes about as much sense to him as removing traffic lights from roadways and having an \u201chonor system.\u201d\n\n\u201cTraffic lights save lives, create order where there would be chaos. And there\u2019s no question that [background checks] save lives, even though there are people who are occasionally going to violate the law,\u201d Siegel says.\n\nHe adds that expanding background checks would ensure that the law fulfills its original intent:f making sure that dangerous people cannot obtain guns.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t accomplish anything by having the prohibitors [for possessing a gun] if you\u2019re not checking to see if someone is in that category,\u201d Siegel says.\n\nHowever, some experts are convinced that the current background check proposals could have broader implications for individual rights.\n\nDavid Kopel, an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute and Denver University adjunct law professor, tells TIME that he is concerned that the federal proposal would help to create a registry of gun owners, which could someday be used to seize firearms from their owners. He also fears that a requirement for gun exchanges to take place at a gun dealer would be too inconvenient for most casual gun sales, and deter people from following the law.\n\n\u201cThere can be ways to set it up to do the background checking without requiring the gun store trip, and without requiring permanent record-keeping. And if you had that, I would endorse it,\u201d Kopel says.\n\nSiegel and Wintemute agree that there are other ways to make background checks more effective.\n\nFor instance, Wintemute argues that states and the federal government should work to encourage more states to add felonies to record systems. Only 71% of all felony charges with final disposition were recorded in state criminal history information systems in 2016. Wintemute notes that the guns used in some mass shootings \u2013 including the Charleston, S.C., and the Sutherland Springs, Texas, shootings \u2013 might not have been sold if the background checks had reviewed the gunmen\u2019s entire histories.\n\nSiegel also argues that Congress should put in place other measures to make sure that dangerous people cannot obtain guns, including ending a rule that lets people buy a gun if a background check isn\u2019t completed in three days and banning people who have committed violent misdemeanors from buying guns.\n\nEven without these measures, however, Siegel argues that background checks should be expanded.\n\n\u201cOn the whole, background checks will save lives,\u201d Siegel says.\n\nWrite to Tara Law at tara.law@time.com.", "description": "After reportedly failing a federal background check, the Odessa shooter managed to get a gun anyway by purchasing it from a private seller.", "authors": ["Tara Law"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/odessa-strong.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1"}
