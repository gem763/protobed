So, hopefully on Monday he is also ready to go,\" Erasmus said.\n\n\"Herschel won't go home - it's definitely not that bad an injury. It's not even a grade one (strain),\" he added.\n\nFlanker Francois Louw, 34, also has a \"few bumps and bruises\" including a swollen knee, Erasmus said.\n\n\"One knee is swollen a little bit - he's at that age where after every game, he takes a little bit longer,\" he said.\n\n\"He'll be fine - we are just managing him a little bit differently to the other guys at this stage.\"\n\nth/ric\n\n\u00a9 Agence France-Presse", "description": "Springbok wing Cheslin Kolbe is not guaranteed to be fit and available for South Africa's Rugby World Cup quarter-final on October 20 in Tokyo.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9454/83b4a0e9a0df4a42b358a32754e6f610.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
