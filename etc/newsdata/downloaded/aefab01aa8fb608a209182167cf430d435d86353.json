Three congressional committees are now probing how Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, as well as a debunked theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. election in an attempt to damage Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\nSondland is set to appear before lawmakers later this week.\n\nAnd in a sign the impeachment inquiry is widening, investigators were discussing whether to question John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, according to people familiar with the matter. Bolton was Hill\u2019s direct superior at the NSC.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cRudy Giuliani has clearly been a leading force for the administration in defining a shadow foreign policy in Ukraine,\u201d Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) told reporters after emerging from Hill\u2019s testimony, though he declined to say whether Hill testified to that effect. \u201cThere was an official foreign policy, which was attempting to counter corruption in Ukraine, and then there was Rudy Giuliani and the gang that couldn\u2019t shoot straight who worked for him, who were involved precisely [in] connecting with corruption in Ukraine and promoting corruption in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nGiuliani on Monday night said: \u201cI don\u2019t know Fiona and can\u2019t figure out what she is talking about,\u201d adding that his contact with Ukrainian officials was set up with the State Department.\n\n\u201cI reported everything back to them,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing shadowy about it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHill, who left the NSC voluntarily this summer, worked closely on Ukraine matters with two diplomats who have become central to the impeachment inquiry. One, Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, testified last week about her understanding of Giuliani\u2019s efforts to remove her from her post. Giuliani and some of his allies in Ukraine saw Yovanovitch, a career diplomat, as a threat to their financial and political interests, she told lawmakers last week.\n\nHill told the committees that she was infuriated by Yovanovitch\u2019s ouster. The ambassador, who had a reputation for combating corruption in Ukraine, told impeachment investigators last week that her departure came as a direct result of pressure Trump placed on the State Department to remove her.\n\nRaskin, speaking Monday after Hill\u2019s deposition, said that Yovanovitch was the \u201cvictim of a political hit job,\u201d but that both she and Hill would be considered heroes after the impeachment inquiry concludes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHill also worked closely with Sondland, who in text messages appeared to defend Trump against the allegation that he was pursuing investigations in exchange for U.S. support to Ukraine.\n\nSondland plans to tell impeachment investigators Thursday that the content of a text message he sent to the chief U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, insisting there was no quid pro quo in play, was given to him directly by Trump in a phone call, The Washington Post reported Saturday.\n\nSondland also plans to tell lawmakers he has no knowledge of whether the president was telling him the truth. \u201cIt\u2019s only true that the president said it, not that it was the truth,\u201d a person familiar with Sondland\u2019s planned testimony told The Post over the weekend.\n\nAD\n\nThis week is shaping up to be one of the most active in the four-week-old impeachment inquiry. Administration officials are facing a series of deadlines to turn over documents that investigators say are relevant to their inquiry.\n\nAD\n\nVice President Pence, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Giuliani and officials at the Pentagon and the Office of Management and Budget have all been served with document requests about the administration\u2019s policies in Ukraine and in some cases their own interactions with Ukrainian officials.\n\nTwo of Giuliani\u2019s clients, charged last week with violations of campaign finance law, also face a Wednesday deadline for documents. They were instrumental in setting up meetings for Giuliani with Ukrainian officials he felt could be useful to Trump\u2019s political interests.\n\nAD\n\nLawmakers also expect to hear testimony from other witnesses, including on Tuesday from George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for Ukraine, whom Giuliani and conservative media figures have accused of trying to protect the Bidens from an investigation and of working at the behest of billionaire George Soros, whose Open Society Foundation has funded anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\nThe committees plan to hear as well from Ambassador William \u201cBill\u201d Taylor, who features prominently in the text messages with Sondland, questioning whether the administration was withholding aid in exchange for Ukraine launching investigations.\n\nMichael McKinley, who resigned last week as a senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Laura Cooper, the deputy assistant director of defense, will also appear for testimony, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nAD\n\nHill served on the National Security Council as senior director for Russia and Europe from mid-2017 until the week before Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke by phone on July 25. During their conversation, Trump asked Zelensky to do him a \u201cfavor\u201d by investigating Biden and the claim of Ukrainian interference in the U.S. election, according to a memorandum documenting the call that was released last month by the White House.\n\nAD\n\nShe appeared Monday on Capitol Hill under congressional subpoena, as the Trump administration has sought to block current and former officials from testifying in the impeachment probe.\n\nHill, who previously served on the National Intelligence Council during the George W. Bush administration, is known for being a vocal critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin and an institutionalist \u2014 stances that put her at odds with Trump\u2019s embrace of Russia\u2019s resurgent role in the region and with Giuliani\u2019s style of maneuvering in Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\nAlmost as soon as her testimony began, the proceeding was disrupted by a partisan dispute. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) attempted to sit in on the deposition \u201cas a member of Congress,\u201d he said, arguing that \u201cif Adam Schiff and the House Democrats were so proud of their work, they would be willing to show it.\u201d Gaetz sits on the Judiciary Committee but not on any of the three panels conducting the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAD\n\nSchiff (Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and the Democrats\u2019 point man on the impeachment probe, objected to Gaetz joining. The question was then put to a parliamentarian, who decided that Gaetz should leave the room, which he did.\n\nSpeaking to reporters afterward, Gaetz continued to deride the proceedings as a \u201csham or charade,\u201d lamenting that because the full House has not voted on an impeachment process, \u201cthere are no rules,\u201d and thus his presence should have been permitted.\n\nRepublicans also have argued that full transcripts of the depositions should be made public, a request that Democrats have so far declined. The Constitution gives the House broad authority to conduct an impeachment and says nothing about how proceedings should be held.\n\nSpeaking at an event Monday evening in New York, Schiff said that lawmakers would release all transcripts of the depositions, adding that some witnesses who have testified behind closed doors may return in open session.\n\nThe White House has refused to participate in the inquiry, asserting that Trump is owed \u201cdue process\u201d to call his own witnesses and cross-examine those called by the Democrats.", "description": "Fiona Hill, who resigned from her National Security Council post earlier this year, provided roughly 10 hours of testimony.", "authors": ["Karoun Demirjian", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On National Security", "Shane Harris", "Intelligence", "National Security Reporter", "Rachael Bade", "Congressional Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jRKrwSeM9XcQ-d78vkaCff5ALzI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3QZTU4HORYI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
