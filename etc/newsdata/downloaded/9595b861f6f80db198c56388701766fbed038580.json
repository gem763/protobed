Here\u2019s what you need to know.", "language": "en", "text": "There has been a steady drumbeat of attention for the sandbox builder. Mojang, the company behind the game, released two major updates in the past year or so. It\u2019s also working on two new offshoots of the original game. One is an augmented-reality experience for your phone (think Pok\u00e9mon Go) and the other, Minecraft Dungeon, is an RPG similar to Diablo.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSwedish YouTube creator PewDiePie returned to Minecraft in June, bringing with him one of the largest audiences on the platform. He has already posted more than 100 Minecraft-themed videos. Some of the biggest Fortnite streamers are even swinging their pickax. Depending on how you play, some streamers have said Minecraft can be a welcome respite from the grinding gameplay of battles royal.\n\n\u201cEveryone has kind of been starved when it comes to creativity, and Minecraft allows them to sort of express that,\u201d professional Fortnite streamer Ali \u201cMyth\u201d Kabbani recently told The Post. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice break from the usual.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to return to mining or maybe create a new world for the first time, The Post talked with two YouTube creators \u2014 Preston Arsement of PrestonPlayz and Tyler Pappas of logdotzip \u2014 and asked for their advice.\n\nPick an edition: Bedrock or Java\n\nFirst, there are two slightly different versions of the main game \u2014 Bedrock and Java.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJava is the original version. It remains a hub for hobbyists who want to modify the game in their own custom servers. Minecraft, at its core, is an incredibly flexible game. People have created servers to play versions of Pok\u00e9mon. There are countless libraries online for Minecraft enthusiasts to play and alter older versions of the game.\n\nBedrock is the multiplatform edition of Minecraft, which allows players to mine with friends on other devices \u2014 phones, consoles, etc. In Bedrock, rather than adding lines of code to modify the game, there\u2019s a setup marketplace for the community.\n\n\u201cThe marketplace is basically this thriving ecosystem that takes the best of user-generated content and lets the player base purchase it,\u201d Pappa said. \u201cNot only to expand their gameplay experiences but to directly support the teams behind it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBedrock is a bit more buttoned-up and probably the future of the franchise with its cross-platform capabilities, while Java is the tried-and-true edition for some hardcore fans.\n\nIn the beginning, find your village people\n\nIf you\u2019re starting a new survival world in Minecraft, Pappa\u2019s recommendation is to get to the nearest village. These towns, and the villagers in them, are more important than ever after recent updates to the game.\n\nVillages will provide a roof over your head and an empty bed for those dark early days playing Minecraft. You can live off their crops and use the towns as a home base, at least until you build a house of your own.\n\nOnce you\u2019re on your own two feet, Pappa said you should make use of the utility blocks around town \u2014 even \u201cborrow\u201d a few to place in your future home. Grindstones, smokers, stone cutters and other utility blocks are all available for players to forge new items or craft more efficiently.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne update from Mojang has expanded on how and what you can trade with villagers. If you make the most of it, trading can become a simple way to get your hands on rare items, Pappa said. Protect the villagers from the aptly named \u201cpillagers,\u201d a new spawn in the game that will attack in coordinated raids, and you\u2019ll get better deals in trades with the townspeople.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re making it more interactive and having more of an experience past beating the Ender Dragon,\u201d Arsement said.\n\nGo for a swim, play with animals\n\nYou could always swim in Minecraft, but a year ago Mojang provided a reason to explore the ocean depths with an Aquatic update. There are sunken ships, treasure maps, tridents and, yes, underwater zombies. You can build your next humble abode underwater, Pappas said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAnd what an exciting concept, right?\u201d he added. \u201cBuild underwater, give it an air dome. Watch as fish swim by your head.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhile you\u2019re down there, swim with the dolphins or the puffer fish. Speaking of both, Minecraft now has more than your typical farm animals in the game \u2014 with bees, pandas, turtles and foxes that huddle into their own tail for a quick nap.\n\n\u201cMinecraft is a very relaxing game,\u201d Pappas said. \u201cIt\u2019s got lovely piano music in the background. Fun cute animals to look at. There\u2019s no impetus to kill everyone and get first place, and I think that resonates with a lot of people,\u201d Pappas said, referring to Fortnite and other battle royal games.\n\nAD\n\nBut, despite all the new bells and whistles, the core game hasn\u2019t changed. Minecraft remains a massive sandbox to jump into whether you\u2019re looking to explore \u201can endless procedurally generated world\u201d or just create with a digital Lego set, Pappas said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s essentially a platform in which we can do whatever we want,\u201d Pappas said. \u201cThat\u2019s what has allowed it to survive for the last decade.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nAD", "description": "Before you grab your pickax, here's what Minecraft has added in recent years.", "authors": ["Teddy Amenabar", "Audience Editor Embedded On The Local Desk"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KYfKy65VYTNuAjvbDbP6ud0t8z8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KBXMM4MFYBCODLAO44ORZ4DSDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
