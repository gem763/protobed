PRECIOUS-Gold set for best week in five, palladium sets record high\n\n* Palladium hits record high of $1,785.50 an ounce\n\n* Silver climbs to a one-month peak of $18.33 an ounce\n\n* GRAPHIC-2019 asset returns: http://tmsnrt.rs/2jvdmXl\n\n\n\n(Adds comment, details, updates prices)\n\nBy Eileen Soreng\n\nOct 25 (Reuters) - Gold gained on Friday and was on course\n\nfor its best week in five amid continued uncertainty around\n\nBrexit and the health of the global economy, while a sustained\n\nsupply crunch propelled palladium to a record high.\n\nSpot gold was up 0.7% at $1,513.52 per ounce at 1238\n\nGMT, having earlier hit its highest since Oct. 10 at $1,514.24.\n\nThe precious metal has gained about 1.5% this week.\n\nU.S. gold futures GCcv1 were up 0.7% at $1,515.5.\n\n\"Brexit has gone into another limbo and there is still some\n\nuncertainty over the progress of (U.S.-China) trade talks. These\n\nare increasing risk aversion and pushing gold higher,\" said FXTM\n\nanalyst Lukman Otunuga.\n\nThe European Union agreed to London's request for a Brexit\n\ndeadline extension on Friday but set no new departure date,\n\ngiving Britain's divided parliament time to decide on Prime\n\nMinister Boris Johnson's call for a snap election. Johnson will push ahead with plans to leave the European\n\nUnion and with the government's domestic agenda even if\n\nlawmakers fail to back a snap election, his spokesman said.\n\nOn the trade front, top U.S. and Chinese trade officials\n\nwill discuss plans on Friday for China to buy more U.S. farm\n\nproducts. In return, Beijing will request the cancellation of some\n\nplanned and existing U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, people\n\nbriefed on the talks told Reuters.\n\nGold has gained about 17% this year mainly due to the\n\nU.S.-China trade spat and the resulting impact on the global\n\neconomy.\n\nSafe-haven buying is clearly a good solution for investors\n\ngiven the current geopolitical and economic scenario, said\n\nAfshin Nabavi, senior vice president at precious metals trader\n\nMKS SA.\n\nData on Thursday showed new orders for key U.S.-made capital\n\ngoods and shipments declined in September, a sign that business\n\ninvestment remains soft amid the trade war, building the case\n\nfor another U.S. rate cut next week. Elsewhere, palladium XPD= was down 0.2% at $1,774.68 an\n\nounce, having earlier hit an all-time high of $1,785.50.\n\nConcerns about a supply crunch for the metal used in\n\nautocatalysts have helped lift palladium prices by about 40%\n\nthis year, despite a weakening auto sector.\n\nPalladium is in a strong uptrend supported by the\n\nfundamental story, Saxo Bank commodity strategist Ole Hansen\n\nsaid. \"If we do break $1,785, we could see some additional\n\nbuyers into that break, taking palladium to the 1,800 level.\"\n\nSilver climbed 3% to $18.31 per ounce after hitting\n\nits highest since Sept. 25 at $18.33. It was up about 4% for the\n\nweek.\n\nPlatinum XPT= was up 0.9% at $931.84, on course for its\n\nbest week in eight.\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold set for best week in five, palladium sets record high", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA680GO_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
