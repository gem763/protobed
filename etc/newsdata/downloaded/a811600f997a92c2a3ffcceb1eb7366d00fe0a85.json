In an interview with MarketWatch, he insists we are in a secular bull market and the stock rally is far from over.\n\nWhat Saut is referring to is a rising or falling market trend, which can last from 5 to 25 years, but is peppered by smaller bear or bull markets, respectively. And most investors aren\u2019t experienced enough to recognize either, he says.\n\n\u201cThe point is, a secular bull markets last 15-plus years. You can run how long this thing should last, either from October of 2008 or March of 2009 or April of 2013. The point is there ought to be years left in this thing and no one believes it,\u201d said Saut. He adds that anyone not retiring in at least the next three years stands to lose if they stop believing in this bull market.\n\nInvestors are \u201cscared to death,\u201d convinced by the media that a recession is coming and putting too much faith in soft data such as economic surveys, he argued. \u201cIf we\u2019re going into a recession, why are the most economically sensitive stocks, mainly the semiconductor equipment stocks, holding up so much better than the S&P 500?\u201d Saut asked.\n\nThe widely followed PHLX Semiconductor Index exchange-traded fund SOX, -0.71% is up 35% year to date. The S&P 500 SPX, -0.45% is up 17% so far this year.\n\nGiven the current interest-rate environment, he says his indicators point to a multiple of 19 times forward earnings for stocks, which would put the S&P 500 at around 3,200, nearly 9% above the index\u2019s Monday close.\n\nSaut has made prescient market calls in the past, predicting a \u201cwaterfall decline\u201d for equities a month before the October 1987 crash. As for the here and now, Saut believes the S&P bottomed last week at 2,855. And then there\u2019s his long-term investment model that \u201cflipped positive on October 2008 and never turned negative and says we have years left in this thing.\u201d\n\nRead: The Elizabeth Warren stock-market correction will happen sooner than you think\n\nThe market\n\nDow YM00, -0.68%, S&P ES00, -0.63% and Nasdaq NQ00, -0.61% futures are dropping.
