Neither of us suffered. The bear maybe suffered more. It rarely sees human bears like me,\u201d the 6ft, 250lbs fighter later told a local news website.\n\nChelyabinsk-born heavyweight Novoselov, who boasts a pro record of 9 wins and two defeats, has some unorthodox training methods \u2013 and earlier this year nearly took one training partner\u2019s arm off when he accidentally plunged an axe into it.\n\nNovoselov is also notorious for having been jailed for 14 years in 1993 on murder charges, and spent more time behind bars in 2012 when he was found guilty of links to a drugs business.\n\nHe was last in action at the end of June when he defeated Aleksandar Aleksic via first-round TKO at Fight Championship Aslan.\n\nNovoselov could be considered a bear-wrestling heavyweight equivalent to UFC lightweight king Khabib Nurmagomedov.\n\nFootage of the famous Dagestani fighter wrestling a bear as a youngster went viral several years back, and has added to Khabib\u2019s legend.\n\nNurmagomedov has been reunited with his ursine rival several times since, although his antics have fallen foul of animal rights group PETA.\n\nFollowing Nurmagomedov\u2019s recent title defense against Dustin Poirier, the group told Business Insider that it \u201cencourages the UFC to evaluate its relationship with Mr Nurmagomedov until he shows a clear change in attitude and commitment to showing animals the respect they deserve.\u201d", "description": "Move over Khabib Nurmagomedov, there\u2019s a new bear-wrestling Russian MMA fighter in town.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5d9752e52030275a11247e23.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
