In a fabulous case of reality imitating remakes of classic romantic comedies, Dennis Quaid is engaged to a 26-year-old blonde Ph.D. student named Laura Savoie, who we\u2019re pretty sure is not a 26-year-old blonde publicist named Meredith Blake. Per People, Quaid proposed during a sunset stroll in Hawaii and definitely not in his very own Napa Valley winery, and, get this, we can\u2019t even confirm if the couple first met on the Queen Elizabeth II or not. \u201cShe was actually taking a selfie of us,\u201d Quaid said of the proposal, \u201cand I put the ring in front and said, \u2018Will you marry me?\u2019 And then she fell down.\u201d Was it because she saw a lizard? Or an air mattress floating in a nearby lake? Or the dawning realization that Quaid\u2019s actual tween twins, shared with ex-wife Kimberly Buffington, likely won\u2019t be sent off to boarding school in Timbuktu? Time to get into some mischief, kiddos!\n\nWatch out for those twins. \ud83d\udc6f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f https://t.co/Rloat1gLCy \u2014 Elaine Hendrix (@elaine4animals) October 21, 2019", "description": "\u201cParent Trap\u201d star Dennis Quaid is engaged to Ph.D. student Laura Savoie, and their age difference has people talking.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/21/21-dennis-quaid-fiance.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
