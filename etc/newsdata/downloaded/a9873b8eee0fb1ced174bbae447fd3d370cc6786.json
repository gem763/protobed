It is allowing us to gain new insights that we really haven\u2019t been able to do before,\" Lars Bejder said.\n\n'The team used drones to capture the view from above. Cameras and sensors attached to the whales by suction cups gathered video and data from the whale's point of view', reads the study.\n\n\u201cBasically we have two angles and the drone\u2019s perspective is showing us these bubble nets if you will and how the bubbles are starting to come to the surface and how the animals come up through the bubble net as they surface.\"\n\n\"While the cameras on the whales are telling us from the animal\u2019s perspective, so overlaying these two data sets is quite exciting,\u201d added Bejder.\n\nYouTube\n\nScientists think that the calls of the whales might create an acoustic 'wall of sound' that intimidates the prey into remaining inside the bubble-net. With the bubbles they churn up, they have enough fish and krill inside the torrent, to satiate their appetite.\n\n\"Around 3,000 humpback whales travel to Alaska during the feeding period in the summer,\" Bejder said in the video.\n\nWhen comes the time to migrate for the winter, whales travel 3,000 miles to Hawaii and do not eat till they return to Alaska. Humpbacks are one of only two whale species that has been observed engaging in bubble-net feeding, say scientists.", "description": "Researchers from the University of Hawai\u2018i\u2019 at M\u0101noa used cameras and sensors with suction-cup tags, as well as drones, to capture new footage of whale bubble-net feeding in southeast Alaska. Bubble-net fishing involves a group of whales near the ocean surface rounding up fish or krill inside a circle of bubbles exhaled from their blowholes", "authors": ["Kc Archana"], "top_image": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2019/Oct/whale_1571218503_800x420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
