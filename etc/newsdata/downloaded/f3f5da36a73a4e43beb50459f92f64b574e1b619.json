They also visited the petting zoo and took a turn on the inflatable slides.\n\n'My children are daredevils': Chyna shared footage of King Cairo on the jumper\n\nThe 31-year-old reality star has King with Tyga and daughter Dream with her ex-fianc\u00e9 Rob Kardashian, and has said her secret to successfully co-parenting her brood is to make sure she can communicate easily with both her exes.\n\nShe said: 'The key [to coparenting] is basically communication. It makes it a little bit easier if you can communicate with your child's other parent. That's the best and healthiest way.'\n\nChyna praised both Tyga and Rob for helping out when she needs time to 'reset' away from her children.\n\nDay out: Chyna shares Dream with her ex Rob Kardashian and the former couple's once explosive relationship is now cordial\n\nMama's girl: The two year old enjoyed her time with her mother\n\nShe added: 'My children's dads \u2026 help out because you have to have that time to yourself, just to even go to the spa and kind of reset. The days that they're with their dads, then I go take my trips.\n\n'Basically, I'm always home with [my kids].'\n\nAnd the Real Blac Chyna star also revealed her son King Cairo is aware of his mother's fame, and is 'overly protective' of both her and his little sister.\n\nSpeaking to Us Weekly magazine, she said: 'If we go to the movies or out to eat and there'll just be people obviously around, he'll be like, \"Mom, you know that they know that you're Blac Chyna, right? And they know me, too.\"\n\nFamily fun: King throws himself down an inflateable slide\n\nSoft landing: The youngster enjoyed his day at the pumpkin patch\n\n'And I'm like, \"How do you even know stuff like this?\" If it's paparazzi outside, he'll be like, \"No pictures!\" And I'm like, \"It's okay.\" He's just funny. He's just super overly protective of me and Dream.'\n\nMeanwhile, Chyna previously insisted there's 'no animosity' between herself and Rob, after their explosive split in 2017.\n\nShe said: 'Co-parenting is good. With both of my baby fathers, we have a mutual agreement and everything runs smoothly. So there's no animosity in the air, everything's like, good. We're all in a good place.'", "description": "Blac Chyna's personal relationships have a habit of grabbing the headlines.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/18/19998468-0-image-a-62_1571678206494.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
