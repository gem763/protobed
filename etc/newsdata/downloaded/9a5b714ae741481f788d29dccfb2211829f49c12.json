The American surveillance aircraft that had been watching ISIS are now watching their own troops.\n\nProtecting the remaining U.S. forces in Syria is now the priority for the U.S. drones and manned aircraft overhead, according to a knowledgeable U.S. official who was not permitted to speak to reporters.\n\nIt\u2019s a mission of necessity now that the remaining hundreds of American servicemembers in Syria have come under attack from the army of their NATO ally and the Syrian Kurds whom the U.S. betrayed are now welcoming in Bashar al-Assad\u2019s Russian-sponsored forces. Their presence has propelled the U.S. in northeastern Syria toward an endgame, since the U.S. betrayal of the Kurds removed the local partner the U.S. needed to wage war against ISIS members\u2014who are now breaking free of their prisons.\n\nThe remaining hundreds of U.S. troops, for now, have pulled back to the southern at-Tanf base near the Iraqi and Jordanian borders. American reconnaissance and surveillance over Syria is now about protecting bivouacking U.S. forces, the official said, rather than watching what happens to the newly-freed ISIS fighters.\n\nThe U.S. Spoiled a Deal That Might Have Saved the Kurds, Former Top Official Says\n\nAmong the reconnaissance assets remaining over Syria are Apache attack helicopters, a measurement of preparation for a withdrawal under fire.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper said on Monday that the Turkish forces pose an \u201cunacceptable risk\u201d to the remaining American forces, prompting what he called a \u201cdeliberate withdrawal of U.S. military personnel from northeast Syria.\u201d Esper blamed Turkey for the \u201crelease of many dangerous ISIS detainees\u201d; hours earlier, President Trump blamed the Kurdish forces he double-crossed.\n\nUncertainty surrounds the remnant of the U.S. mission in Syria. But without both persistent overwatch and a partner on the ground\u2014consequences of Trump acquiescing to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s invasion\u2014the basic prerequisites for mitigating any ISIS revival in Syria are gone. Many observers now expect ISIS to reconstitute itself in some form.\n\nIn its media releases, ISIS still continues to claim a range of operations against Kurdish targets in attacks across northeastern Syria. In an operation announced on Sunday, ISIS media claimed its fighters shelled a U.S. military base in Hasakah governorate, not far from the sprawling ISIS detention camp in al-Hol, which it says U.S. forces have used to launch Apache raids against its forces.\n\nOver a week after giving Turkey a green light to invade, Trump announced Monday that he will sanction Ankara economically for the invasion in a forthcoming executive order. In addition to declaring the Turks \u201cresponsible\u201d for detaining ISIS fighters, Trump referenced keeping a \u201csmall footprint\u201d of U.S. troops at at-Tanf \u201cto continue to disrupt remnants of ISIS.\u201d Without a Syrian partner on the ground and with overhead hardware focused on protecting themselves, it remains to be seen what that small force can accomplish.\n\nEsper said in a Monday statement that the Turkish invasion\u2014which the administration is now claiming to have always opposed despite Trump\u2019s public acquiescence to it\u2014had endangered the anti-ISIS mission. Erdogan will bear \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for any ISIS resurgence, according to the Pentagon chief.\n\nAt the Beirut Institute Summit in Abu Dhabi, Gen. David Petraeus, former director of Central Intelligence and, prior to that, commander of U.S. Central Command, which oversees the U.S. military operations in the Mideast, warned there was no walking away from the threat of ISIS or from the region.\n\n\u201cTrying to leave the Middle East is a little like Michael Corleone trying to leave the Mafia,\u201d Petraeus said, referring to the Godfather movies. \u201cYou can try but you are going to keep being pulled back in.\u201d\n\nSir John Scarlett, former head of the Britain\u2019s foreign intelligence service, MI6, said flatly there is \u201cno substitute\u201d for the U.S. in the region, notwithstanding Trump\u2019s desire to bail out.\n\n\u201cIt certainly does not appear there is a master plan,\u201d said Petraeus.", "description": "Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/GettyThe retreat of U.S. forces in Syria away from the Turkish invasion is having a downstream effect benefitting the so-called Islamic State.
