And in fact, even more than unremarkable \u2014 on Monday, the S&P 500 dropped 1 basis point; on Tuesday, the S&P 500 rose 3 basis points.\n\nSeen this way, almost nothing has happened this week. But beneath the surface of a seemingly placid market there have been two brutal days for trades that were defining parts of the narrative over the last few months \u2014 SaaS and the U.S. consumer.\n\nAnd amid this carnage, we\u2019ve seen a great rotation away from the momentum names that have been loved in this market and into the value plays that have been hated.\n\nOn Monday, growth stocks felt most of the pain, particularly newer entrants to public markets with names like Okta (OKTA), Twilio (TWLO), The Trade Desk (TTD), Zoom Video (ZM), and Slack (WORK) each dropping 5% or more. And while we joke that Beyond Meat (BYND) has become a SaaS play in this market, that stock, too, was down over 4% to start the week.\n\nThe iShares momentum factor ETF MTUM (MTUM) fell 1.7% on Monday, with momentum\u2019s drop relative to value logging its single-largest decline since at least 2013, according to Bespoke Investment Group. And with rates rising on Monday, financials outperformed for the first time in over a month.\n\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. consumer-centric trade that has been driving optimism about not only the market but also the economy was taken to the woodshed. McDonald's (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX), and Chipotle (CMG) shares all dropped more than 3%, while shares of Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) both lost more than 2.5%. Banks outperformed again on Tuesday.\n\nDuring both sessions, the small cap Russell 2000 \u2014 which has lagged the S&P 500 all summer \u2014 also outperformed markedly, rising more than 1% during each of the week's first two trading days.\n\nNow, rotational stories during any one market session lead to all kinds of narrative creep. Did news over the weekend that The We Company is facing a more than 50% haircut during its IPO process weigh on hot tech stocks on Monday? Did news that Wendy's (WEN) is pushing into breakfast while investors still take stock of Starbucks' (SBUX) guidance cut last week weigh on consumer names on Tuesday?\n\nThere were probably folks making both cases.\n\nBut as we\u2019ve seen at various points during this bull run, the first two days of this trading week look like classic rotations out of what\u2019s been working and into what hasn\u2019t, as Bloomberg\u2019s Luke Kawa wrote Tuesday.\n\nThe market\u2019s moves, in other words, are not about news of the day but flows of the day. As Nick Colas at DataTrek Research wrote on Tuesday, \"We\u2019re long past the days where money managers had consistent fresh inflows of new investor capital to sprinkle around. Rebalancing portfolios means a dollar-for-dollar exchange of 'out with the old, in with the new.'\"\n\nIn a note to clients on Tuesday, JPMorgan strategist Marko Kolanovic outlined how he sees positioning (hedge funds equity exposure is near post-crisis lows and investor sentiment as measured by the AAII is at decade lows), and factor divergence (momentum\u2019s outperformance relative to value is worse than any historical factor divergence, according to Kolanovic) as creating an unbalanced market that is now, well, balancing.\n\nAnd for the bulls, this rotation might offer a path towards new highs for the stock market.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the value rotation can continue and the broad market could move higher going into October [trade] negotiations,\u201d Kolanovic wrote Tuesday, \u201cand if real progress is made, continue into a more sustained rally.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven that the S&P 500 is heavy in bond proxies and secular growth, we would expect higher upside potential in small caps, cyclicals, value, and Emerging Market stocks than the broad S&P 500. If the October negotiations fail, these moves could be unwound, but given the extreme low positioning and style tilt, we think the downside is limited.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll see if this rotation continues on Wednesday.\n\nBy Myles Udland, reporter and co-anchor of The Final Round.
