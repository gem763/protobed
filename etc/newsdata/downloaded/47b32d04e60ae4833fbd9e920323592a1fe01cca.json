Guns equal freedom!\n\nDespite the mantra from the left, there\u2019s no such thing as an \u201cassault rifle.\u201d It\u2019s a term they invented to make guns sound scary, and it works. I prefer to call semi-automatic rifles, such as the AR-15 by their proper names: \u201canti-dictator rifles,\u201d \u201cself-defense rifles\u201d and sporting rifles. They\u2019re available for purchase to all law-abiding citizens of age, as they should be. Blacks should be skeptical of any smooth-talking politician that claims he or she wants to keep us \u201csafe\u201d by confiscating guns or banning so-called \u201cassault weapons.\u201d Guns have the last say in determining a free society from an enslaved one. That\u2019s why the Second Amendment is so important.\n\nDemocrats have been selling gun control in the black community as long as I can remember. They play on our fears because they want to control us.\n\nNo one wants to see senseless murders committed by thugs with guns. But we can\u2019t allow Democrats to blur the line between criminals that commit violent gun crimes and law-abiding gun owners that simply want to defend their lives and property from tyrants and criminals.\n\nDemocrats and their allies in the media often ignore the high gun-crime rates that exist in their own Blue cities like Chicago, Los Angeles and Baltimore, despite having the strictest gun control laws in the country. Furthermore, they rarely mention that the overwhelming amount of violent gun crimes are suicide, drug and gang related. Mass shootings are a big problem, but they\u2019re a tiny percentage of annual gun crimes. Also, as we learned with the Parkland shooter, plenty of warning signs were ignored. Therefore, we can deduce that mass shootings have the potential to be prevented when people speak up, and existing laws are enforced. By sensationalizing these tragedies, Democrats have convinced too many blacks that guns are evil instead of the criminals that use them for ill purposes.\n\nRemember, cops can\u2019t be everywhere. We can\u2019t rely on them to protect us from bad guys. In most cases, cops are called only after a crime has been committed or is in progress. That\u2019s too late! Rarely do they prevent crimes.\n\nBlacks must be vigilant protecting our Second Amendment right. It\u2019s easy to grow complacent post-slavery, but we must always keep the big picture in mind - freedom!\n\nHere are 3 reasons why blacks should always oppose any form of gun control:\n\nFirst, during the Reconstruction Era it was white southern Democrats that made a mockery of the 13th Amendment that ended slavery by implementing so-called \u201cblack codes.\u201d The codes made it illegal for former slaves (freedmen) to own guns, read and much more.\n\nAccording to the book titled \u201cThe American Promise,\u201d in Mississippi, insulting language or gestures from blacks was illegal. Across the south, black codes barred freedmen from jury duty and denied them the right to vote no matter how educated, intellectual or wealthy they were: \u201cAt the core of the black codes, however, lay the matter of labor. Faced with the death of slavery, legislators sought to hustle freedmen back to the plantations.\" Under so-called \u201capprenticeship laws\u201d black children could be taken away from parents who were deemed unfit by judges and bound to work for planter \u201cguardians.\u201d Freedmen couldn\u2019t work outside of an occupation that required hard labor or domestic service without paying an annual tax. A tax they couldn\u2019t afford. Imagine how much quicker blacks would\u2019ve secured their rightful place in American society had we been allowed to own guns.\n\nSecondly, contrary to popular belief, far more guns are used in America to prevent crimes and defend life than are used in violent crimes. According to a column in Forbes titled \u201cThat Time The CDC Asked About Defensive Gun Uses,\u201d people in the U.S. use their guns to save lives as many as 3,000,000 times per year, or every 13 seconds. Mainstream media doesn\u2019t report this because it doesn\u2019t fit their narrative that guns are bad, and they\u2019re only used to harm people. Instead, they purposely exploit gun violence in hopes that you\u2019ll be shamed into giving up your guns and forfeiting your right to bear arms altogether.\n\nThirdly, gun control doesn\u2019t work for two reasons: 1) criminals don\u2019t obey laws, and 2) According to John Lott, president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, and author of the book the \u201cWar on Guns,\u201d a major source for illegal guns in America are drug dealers.\n\nHaving grown up in some tougher neighborhoods of Los Angeles, I can attest to this. I had a friend loan me a gun as early as 10 years of age. In grade school, local politicians and academics would show up at our assemblies and rail against guns, but they didn\u2019t have to worry about gangs or watch their backs walking home from school, so we didn\u2019t listen. Illegal guns are the norm in the \u2018hood. Sadly, what wasn\u2019t normal were talks about the preservation of the Second Amendment and the importance of safe and legal gun ownership.\n\nGuns are the most efficient tools ever created for saving lives and preserving liberty. Our ancestors were denied their Second Amendment right. As a result, they endured slavery and torture beyond our comprehension. I can think of nothing that dishonors their memory more than being dumb enough to voluntarily disarm.", "description": "Given America\u2019s history with slavery, black people should be the .10/14/2019 19:21:11PM EST.", "authors": ["Carl Jackson", "Matt Vespa", "Julio Rosas", "Katie Pavlich", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/240/14dbff60-6610-4684-9a1b-a5e24cd40d42.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
