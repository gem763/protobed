Freiburg defender Robin Koch and striker Luca Waldschmidt started, then Leverkusen forward Nadiem Amiri and Schalke midfielder Suat Serdar came on for second-half debuts.\n\nLoew was forced into a hastily re-arranged defence as Koch replaced centre-back Niklas Stark, who pulled out before kick-off with a stomach bug.\n\nDespite 13 withdrawals due to either illness or injury, Germany impressed early against an Argentina team missing Messi, Sergio Aguero and Angel di Maria.\n\nWith Messi suspended for comments made at the Copa America, Juventus\u2019 Paulo Dybala partnered Lautaro Martinez up front for Argentina.\n\n\u2013 Alario\u2019s impact \u2013\n\nThe friendly was a repeat of the 2014 World Cup final, yet Argentina\u2019s Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo was the only survivor when the Germans won in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nRojo partnered Manchester City veteran Nicolas Otamendi in an Argentina defence which crumbled early on.\n\nA week after scoring four goals for Bayern Munich at Tottenham, Gnabry put Germany ahead on 15 minutes.\n\nThe winger used his pace when Atletico Madrid\u2019s Angel Correa lost possession to get in behind the defence to stab the ball past Argentina goalkeeper Augustin Marchesin.\n\nWhen Rojo then lost the ball to Waldschmidt, Gnabry turned provider, using his pace to present Havertz with a simple tap-in on 22 minutes.\n\nIt should have been 3-0 when Brandt just failed to connect with a Niklas Suele header as Germany looked like they would run away with it.\n\nHowever, the South Americans had the best of the second-half, starting when Scaloni put Alario on for Dybala on 62 minutes.\n\nAlario showed his strength in the air to head past Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen four minutes later.\n\nThe visitors equalised when Alario set up Sevilla\u2019s Lucas Ocampos, a second-half replacement for Correa, to blast past ter Stegen five minutes from time.\n\n\u201cThat was 90 minutes split in two,\u201d said Germany\u2019s stand-in captain Joshua Kimmich.\n\n\u201cIn the first half we stood up to them, in the second we were chasing the game and leaked the goals.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s happened to us a few times now,\u201d Kimmich admitted, knowing Germany must do better in Sunday\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifier at minnows Estonia.\n\nThere was a minute\u2019s silence before kick-off in memory of the two people shot dead in the east German city of Halle earlier Wednesday in an anti-Semitic attack.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Lionel Scaloni praised his battling Argentina side, missing Lionel Messi, as they scored second-half goals to earn a 2-2 draw in a friendly against an experimental Germany team Wednesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/germanyvsargentina091019f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
