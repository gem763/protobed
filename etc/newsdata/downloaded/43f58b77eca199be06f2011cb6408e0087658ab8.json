Despite the update, shares in the private hospital group shed 1.7 per cent, or 44p, to 2606p.\n\nPearson shares were unmoved by an upgrade from brokers at Deutsche Bank, who upgraded the stock to 'hold' from 'sell' and said a huge recent sell-off in its shares 'seems to be over'.\n\nThe education publisher warned on profits last month, amid a tricky restructuring that is seeing it shift from textbooks to digital products and services. Shares closed flat at 674.6p.\n\nFTSE 250-listed Micro Focus fell 6.9 per cent, or 75.2p, to a 19-month low of 1012.4p after a Canadian firm, Open Text, poured cold water over rumours that it was looking to buy the British IT giant.\n\nOpen Text denied a Bloomberg report last week that it was mulling a bid for Micro Focus, which is still struggling from the fallout of a merger with HP's software business for \u00a36.6 billion in 2017. The acquisition included HP's troubled Autonomy arm, which is still wading through a fraud trial between HP and Autonomy's founders.\n\nDespite Micro Focus's plunge, the wider FTSE 250 index finished the day 0.4 per cent higher, up 80.26 points, at 20308.79 on hopes the UK will avoid a No Deal Brexit.\n\nThe exporter-heavy FTSE 100 rose 0.2 per cent, or 13.07 points, to 7163.64. It was kept out of the red by rises in some of the index's biggest mining companies, which edged higher as they tracked a boost in copper prices triggered by unrest in top producing country Chile. Riots have swept the capital Santiago and other cities, while there have also been strikes at mines.\n\nAnglo American gained 2.1 per cent, or 40p, to 1939.8p, Rio Tinto added 1 per cent, or 37.5p, to 3999p, while over on the FTSE 250, Kaz Minerals rose 3.3 per cent, or 14.2p, to 448.3p.\n\nOn the junior AIM market, online clothing retailer Koovs was pummelled after the Indian central bank intervened in an investment by the company's largest shareholder, Future Group, and demanded that Future reapply for approval. Koovs warned the investment, for \u00a36.8m worth of shares, may not complete by the end of this year. Its stock sank 37.3 per cent, or 1.9p, to 3.2p.\n\nThere was no fanfare for private investor favourite Angling Direct as it opened its 32nd store and said it will open several more over the next few months.\n\nShares in the fishing tackle retailer were flat at 61.5p.", "description": "Its loans under management reached a record \u00a33.7 billion in the past three months, up by almost a third on the same period last year.", "authors": ["Francesca Washtell For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
