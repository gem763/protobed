REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi\n\nInstead, Barrett just got on with the job at fullback while team mate Richie Mo\u2019unga wore the number 10 shirt during the Rugby Championship.\n\nOver the past two seasons, Canterbury Crusader Mo\u2019unga had been nipping at Barrett\u2019s heels for the coveted jersey with marauding form in Super Rugby.\n\nYet it was still a surprise when coach Steve Hansen tore up the playbook and opted for dual playmakers in the recent tests against South Africa and Australia, with Barrett shifted back and Mo\u2019unga pulling the strings.\n\nPrior to the South Africa match in Wellington, Barrett had not played fullback since coming off the bench against Australia in the lead-up to the 2015 World Cup.\n\nThere was no complaining about the switch, he said, while readily admitting 15 was not his favourite position.\n\n\u201cIt was something I embraced,\u201d the 28-year-old told New Zealand website Stuff ahead of the All Blacks\u2019 World Cup opener against South Africa in Yokohama on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThis is a team sport and it\u2019s the best thing for the team,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe 15 jersey is just as important as the 10 jersey. It\u2019s not an egotistical thing for me. It\u2019s get on with it, do what\u2019s best for the team and support Steve and Fozzie (assistant coach Ian Foster) with the decision.\u201d\n\nSome New Zealand fans were not quite as enthused with the new setup and initial results suggested it had misfired.\n\nThe All Blacks were held 16-16 by the Springboks in Wellington and then thrashed 47-26 by Australia in Perth, having been reduced to 14 men by a red card at halftime.\n\nBack at Eden Park, however, the All Blacks thrashed the Wallabies 36-0, even with Mo\u2019unga forced to leave the field injured in the second half.\n\n\u201cThat was probably the best one yet,\u201d Barrett said.\n\n\u201cIt requires a fair bit of ball to dictate play the way we\u2019d like to. Our intent was certainly there.\u201d\n\nWith Mo\u2019unga injured, Barrett was returned to starting flyhalf for the All Blacks\u2019 92-7 trouncing of Tonga in their final World Cup warmup.\n\nHaving already tasted a World Cup triumph at the 2015 tournament, Barrett hopes his younger brothers Scott, a lock, and outside back Jordie can enjoy a successful title defence with him in Japan.\n\nThe trio became the first set of brothers to start a test match when they lined up against France last year, and could make further history at the World Cup.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like hearing your name read out alongside your brothers,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis cycle of four years has seen Jordie and Scott come on to the scene and work towards this goal of going to the World Cup. Here we are and we can\u2019t wait.\u201d", "description": "For a playmaker who claimed back-to-back World Player of the Year awards as flyhalf in 2016-17, Beauden Barrett might have had some cause to query the decision to move him out of the All Blacks' engine room in a World Cup year.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430049735&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E05J-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
