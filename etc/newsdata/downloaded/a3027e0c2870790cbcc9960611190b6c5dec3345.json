Immediately described as \u201chistoric,\u201d a \u201ccultural reference point,\u201d and \u201cthe 2004 zeitgeist in one image,\u201d the relic is a photo taken at the star-studded grand opening of the Atlantic Center Target. That evening, actors Chlo\u00eb Sevigny (in a Chanel ensemble) and Maggie Gyllenhaal (in a Lacoste polo), joined other iconic New Yorkers to celebrate Brooklyn\u2019s first \u201cmetropolitan store,\u201d posing in front of shopping carts and value-pack Hanes.\n\nBut what, you have to wonder, does Gyllenhaal think of the image? \u201cWhat am I wearing on my feet?\u201d She asks when I show it to her on my phone. She zooms in on her black ballet flats.\n\nGyllenhaal is hosting a bonkers \u201csensory deprivation\u201d dinner held by The Prisoner Wine company for the launch of its latest wine, \u201cEternally Silenced,\u201d whose bottle is almost entirely dipped in wax. You can think of the dinner as being something like the Keanu Reaves restaurant scene in Always Be My Maybe: guests were made to wear blindfolds for the entire first hour of the meal, which included a \u201cforaging\u201d course of flowers and tomatoes eaten off of a tablecloth.\n\nAttendees kept noting how much more social they felt with the zany deprivation props, but being plied with wine before food probably helped too. And when we\u2019re finally given permission to remove the blindfolds, I find a somber Peter Sarsgaard to my left, Gyllenhaal next to him (neither had been blindfolded).\n\nThe burning question of the 2004 Atlantic Center Target opening came up in a brief exchange with Gyllenhaal, one that touched on her role in the The Deuce, her directorial debut (an adaptation of Elena Ferrante\u2019s The Lost Daughter), and sex scenes in a post-#MeToo Hollywood (she believes HBO\u2019s push for intimacy coordinators will set an industry-wide precedent).\n\nWhile she recalled the Target grand-opening, Gyllenhaal seemed to have forgotten about the photo, and was shocked to hear it had become a cultural touchstone 15 years after the fact. I told her people had written entire articles about it. \u201cWhy, why, why, why?\u201d she asked, mystified, and I said something about nostalgia.\n\nPhoto: Jamie McCarthy/WireImage for Seventh House PR\n\nAs for Sarsgaard, still picking at a tiny square of garnished tofu (he says he grew up on a farm killing animals) I really had only one question: Did he know that the movie Orphan (the 2009 horror in which he played the adoptive father of a child who turns out to be a 33-year-old murderess) actually happened in real life?\n\nHappy Halloween, the movie Orphan is real https://t.co/vqjFHVy0BE \u2014 Bridget Read (@bridgetgillard) September 23, 2019\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he said. \u201cIt actually happened in Indiana,\u201d I explained, recounting recent reports that an \u201cunsuspecting Christian couple\u201d had adopted \u201can adorable little girl only to discover she is an adult masquerading as a sociopath.\u201d The girl had tried to kill the parents. Sarsgaard looked disturbed, and noted to guests that the murder weapon in Orphan was CGI, so that the child-actress who played the titular character felt more comfortable.\n\nBy the time the noise-cancelling headphone portion of the deprivation came, Sarsgaard, who doesn\u2019t drink and was surrounded by 30 blitzed new friends, looked grateful. And while I probably wouldn\u2019t recommend a sensory-deprivation dinner to my worst enemy, I don\u2019t regret this one; my senses may have been deprived, but in the end I learned quite a lot.", "description": "Maggie Gyllenhaal had no idea the photo of her and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny from the 2004 Target grand opening had become a cultural touchstone.", "authors": ["Sangeeta Singh-Kurtz"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/26/26-chloe-sevigny-maggie-gyllenhaal-feed.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
