That would shave off just over a third of the price of the $399 Apple Watch Series 5. Wellness Bucks aren\u2019t specifically allocated for wearables; they can also go toward fitness classes and weight loss programs.\n\nSome of the Apple Watch\u2019s features seem aimed at older Americans, including heart rate monitoring and fall detection\n\nDevoted Health isn\u2019t the first insurer to make it easier for people to get an Apple Watch \u2014 Apple has partnered with insurance companies like Aetna and UnitedHealthcare, for instance \u2014 but Devoted Health is a Medicare Advantage insurer, which is a private company that covers Medicare benefits for older Americans.\n\nThough Devoted Health is a relatively small insurer \u2014 CNBC says the company has about 4,000 members and is only available in Florida \u2014 the movement is still significant: 20 million Americans received care through Medicare Advantage in 2018, according to figures from Kaiser Family Foundation. That suggests momentum in Apple\u2019s apparent plans to target Medicare insurers, as CNBC says that \u201cseveral\u201d of the Medicare Advantage plans they contacted were \u201calso considering an Apple Watch fitness benefit.\u201d\n\nSome of the Apple Watch\u2019s features appear to court this market: heart rate monitoring and fall detection are among the perks of newer Apple Watch models. Working with insurers in this way could swell Apple Watch sales as older Americans use them to monitor their habits. Fitbit is also competing in this space, and some insurers offer Fitbits instead of Apple Watches to achieve essentially the same thing. Some insurers, such as Blue Shield of California, have offered people enrolled in their programs incentives for hitting their wearable goals.", "description": "In a major step in Apple\u2019s push to market its Apple Watch as a health and fitness device, a private Medicare insurer is now subsidizing the cost of the Watch for its members, as first reported by CNBC.", "authors": ["Jay Peters", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZzI_Z4ZX-us-KBtqnlV865paz2E=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19208524/vpavic_190913_3669_0258.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
