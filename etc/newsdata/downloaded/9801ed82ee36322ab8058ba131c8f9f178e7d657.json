The price seems more than fair from the player side, and it helps that these games aren\u2019t packed with microtransactions, since they\u2019re already funded by the subscription fee.\n\nBut is that subscription model actually sustainable? And do we want to see other game stores heading in this direction? On this week\u2019s Kotaku Splitscreen, Kirk and I discuss.\n\nFirst up, we talk about games we\u2019re playing. Kirk and I are both living our best (horrible) goose lives in Untitled Goose Game, and Kirk\u2019s also stuck on a hard boss in Gears 5.\n\nHe then runs down his favourite offerings in Apple Arcade before we break for news (31:04) about the Oculus Quest, discuss the sustainability of Apple Arcade and read a bunch of listener emails about weird gaming traditions.\n\nWe close with off-topic discussion (59:54) about Dark Crystal, Hustlers, and Kirk\u2019s music pick.\n\nGet the MP3 here, or read an excerpt below.\n\nMaddy: Or encroached upon the games journalism world of what we talk about. For better or worse, I feel like usually the mobile game conversation is people trying to convince the greater gamer audience: \u201cNo, this one\u2019s really good!\u201d Every now and then, one will rise above. Monument Valley is a good example. There have been a few other mobile games that encroach into that area.\n\nThis is such a huge amount of games that it\u2019s undeniable in some way. I see people who I\u2019ve never seen talk or write about mobile games, and their Twitters and articles are now full of, \u201cBut seriously though, this Apple Arcade stuff is really cool!\u201d That is wild to see.\n\nKirk: There was this period of time, I think before your time, when we did Kotaku Mobile.\n\nMaddy: [Laughs] Definitely before my time.\n\nKirk: It was quite a ways back, I guess. Kotaku Mobile was always this interesting challenge. I think Kotaku Social also existed, and Mike Fahey was sort of shepherding both.\n\nHe did a ton of work; he played all of these games and wrote about them. But it was really tricky to get people to care, because even then, there was always this feeling that mobile games are all kind of trash. They all have these built-in microtransactions.\n\nThere were so many headlines that were, \u201cThis one\u2019s different!\u201d Which, like you said, often that would be the case. There\u2019d be really cool games that would be on mobile. Like Reigns, I remember when I first played Reigns. This game is so cool, works perfectly on a phone. It\u2019s a really brilliant game.\n\nYou want to say to people, \u201cAh, this one\u2019s different,\u201d but then they hear that so many times. The whole thing is a cesspool. As the years went on, I just stopped thinking about it or caring really. I have all these games on my phone; some of them are really good, and I can\u2019t play them anywhere else. But I just don\u2019t care.\n\nIt\u2019s remarkable that Apple put all of this stuff together and dropped this meteor on everyone in order to make everybody pay attention again. And it really worked, because the games are all really good, and it gives you this alternate reality where mobile gaming didn\u2019t just become this bummer cesspool of knockoffs and IP stealing and free-to-play psychology games.\n\nInstead it\u2019s just a bunch of the best kinds of mobile games. I think that\u2019s the remarkable thing about this. I don\u2019t know who at Apple was in charge of this; Apple is super opaque.\n\nMaddy: Yeah, we\u2019ll probably never know.\n\nKirk: Maybe not. At least if they talk a little more about the process of this \u2014 because no one else is really positioned to do something like this. And it feels different. It feels like something I\u2019ve never quite seen in video games before.\n\nMaddy: The big \u201cbut\u201d there is the fact that you still haven\u2019t paid for any of the games that you\u2019ve gotten on the service yet. And that is the question that everyone has about this, which is, how is this a sustainable model? And is it a sustainable model?\n\nIt\u2019s not why I haven\u2019t gotten it, but it\u2019s definitely a question that\u2019s lurking in the back of my mind. We touched on it a little bit last week. I have guilt about these kinds of services and our new subscription-flavoured future. I don\u2019t think I can do anything about it, but I don\u2019t love it.\n\nKirk: Your guilt is related to what exactly?\n\nMaddy: I feel like I actually have started to devalue a lot of pieces of media in ways that I didn\u2019t do when I was growing up in the \u201990s. I used to go to Blockbuster and spend a couple of bucks on renting a movie. But nowadays, I don\u2019t want to spend five dollars on \u201crenting\u201d a movie from iTunes. I just don\u2019t.\n\nI\u2019d rather watch a different movie on a subscription service that I pay for than pay not that much more money to rent a movie. Why is that? That\u2019s interesting. That\u2019s clearly a mental change in me that I\u2019ve observed.\n\nI feel similarly about games. Like Jason was saying before, mobile games in particular have just been framed as ephemeral and valueless for so long that it\u2019s taking a lot for me to get over that mental hurdle and be like, they actually are a thing I should be paying for!\n\nAnd I actually probably always should have been paying five dollars for each of these games, if that were ever possible. But that wasn\u2019t. It was not something that those games could do, because they knew I wouldn\u2019t pay for them, so they structured themselves in such a way that I didn\u2019t have to.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten hours of enjoyment out of the Harry Potter game [for mobile] and I\u2019ve not spent a dime on it, so my enjoyment is basically something that I\u2019m having at expense of the whales out there who are funding this game.\n\nThat\u2019s not a great feeling for me to have about the creation of that game, putting aside any other concerns I might have about that game and its location services. I have other ethical concerns about that game and how it\u2019s funded.\n\nSo then I\u2019m like, OK, cool, in theory Apple Arcade is the answer to my problems. It\u2019s a subscription service. Mentally, I\u2019ve already accepted that subscription services are a thing I\u2019m willing to pay for. But am I paying enough for them? That\u2019s not a problem I can solve individually. It\u2019s just something I\u2019m thinking about.", "description": "Apple Arcade offers up a ton of cool mobile games for only $7.99 per month.
