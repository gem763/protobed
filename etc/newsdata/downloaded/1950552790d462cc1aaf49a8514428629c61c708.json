Impressive at fullback, with bursts of his trick-laden footwork and positional comfort. Also made a courageous breakdown steal, and romped over for as easy a try as he will ever score in second half.\n\nWarrick Gelant: 7\n\nFar more good things than bad in his unusual deployment at No 14. Superb kick collection helped spark Reinach\u2019s hat-trick try, and impressive finish for his own dot-down. One knock-on.\n\nDamian de Allende: 7\n\nConfirmed that, if it were to become necessary, he could switch quite seamlessly to the outside centre channel for a crunch match. Made creative use of his hands, and some tactical kicking was top-notch \u2026 if perhaps a touch excessive at times?\n\nFrans Steyn: 7\n\nThe seasoned pro continues to gradually allay fears over his conditioning and pace levels. Decent shift in steamy conditions under the roof, some assured passing \u2013 and cunning little poach to register easy-peasy personal try.\n\nS\u2019bu Nkosi: 7.5\n\nWould he look a fish out of water on the less familiar left? Hardly. The wing was a bundle of positive energy, including aerial strength in 50-50 contests, reliable hands and clever offloads from contact. Suitably alert, too.\n\nElton Jantjies: 7.5\n\nPurposeful game \u2013 perhaps best flyhalf showing by a Bok at this World Cup so far, even given limitations of Tuesday\u2019s foes. Smooth link-man, deft tactical kicking (though the odd overcook) and commendably direct when he needed to be. Generally impressive off tee as well.\n\nCobus Reinach: 8\n\nCertainly one of his best Test matches (this was his 14th cap) and the speed in those Reinach genes came hugely into play in a variety of pleasing ways. Box kicks were usually well weighted, and his trio of pulsating tries \u2013 including one from a long way out \u2013 within first quarter reportedly makes him fastest RWC hat-trick scorer.\n\nFrancois Louw: 7\n\nThe veteran, adaptable loosie was solid and composed at No 8. Ran onto the ball astutely, was quickly up to pressure Canadian carriers, and made a safe kick-off collection or two, into bargain.\n\nKwagga Smith: 6.5\n\nHis \u201cSevens\u201d mobility and skill set came in handy during the times when Boks had pleasing front-foot mojo. The odd fumble and defensive lapse, but otherwise made some firm tackles and tracked back determinedly when necessary. Good half-break and offload for Nkosi try.\n\nSiya Kolisi: 7\n\nFull shift \u2026 and that after playing four days ago! But the Bok skipper would have benefited enormously from these extended gallops, with some rest to come. Fairly quiet first half, but to his credit he was increasingly assertive as a ball-carrier and tackler as the game developed.\n\nFranco Mostert: 6.5\n\nEagerness sometimes got the better of him, explaining one or two handling deficiencies in Bok raids near the try-line. Leaked a couple of penalties, too. But graft rate very good, as is customary, including carries and safe kick-off receipts.\n\nRG Snyman: 8.5\n\nMade a storming run in the second minute (try eventually came from it) and that set tone for wonderful game. Always roamed hungrily and athletically, was credited with an amazing 17 tackles \u2026 and imperious at lineout time, including at least one pinch off Canadian throw.\n\nVincent Koch: 7.5\n\nGot around the park agreeably stealthily, and his scrummaging was powerful.\n\nSchalk Brits: 7.5\n\nPossibly the last game of his marathon career? But he is still vital to have lurking in the squad. Energetic, as always, and did some smart tidying-up and linking or decoy work. Beautiful step, and then vigorous leg-drive, for a popular try.\n\nThomas du Toit: 6.5\n\nThe Tank Engine might have liked more carries, but sturdy at the set-piece. Victim of cynical charge to his neck by sent-off Josh Larsen.\n\nStandout substitute:\n\nFrans Malherbe: 7\n\nStormers front-row colleague Steven Kitshoff was lively too, but the burly tighthead nicks the laurel partly on sentimental grounds: this was his 35th Test appearance, and marked the happy, belated event of his maiden try.\n\n*Follow our chief writer on Twitter: @RobHouwing", "description": "<strong>Rob Houwing</strong> concurred over the awarding of SA\u2019s dynamic own \u201clumberjack\u201d RG Snyman with player-of-the-match against Canada.", "authors": ["Rob Houwing", "Chief Writer"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9447/0cf4da1534ee4cbf9aec82b162482bbb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
