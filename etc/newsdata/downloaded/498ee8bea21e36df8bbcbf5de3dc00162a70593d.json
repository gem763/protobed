The smart rosary keeps track of the user\u2019s progress.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe eRosary, available for purchase online, is \u201caimed at the peripheral frontiers of the digital world where the young people dwell,\u201d as Vatican News puts it.\n\nAn app-powered gadget may seem at odds with the centuries-old tradition of the rosary \u2014 \"something associated with your grandparents,\u201d said Mathew Schmalz, a religious studies professor at College of the Holy Cross. But Schmalz, a Catholic himself, sees a neat innovation that\u2019s part of a bigger campaign.\n\n\u201cThe Catholic Church is trying \u2014 and maybe its kind of late into the game \u2014 to reclaim a generation that is close to being lost because of all the polarization and scandals within Catholicism and the general secularization of culture,\u201d he told The Washington Post.\n\nAD\n\nThe eRosary follows other Vatican forays into the tech world of iPhones, apps and social media.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2016, when the pope joined Instagram with the handle @Franciscus, his Twitter account @Pontifex had already racked up nearly 9 million followers. That same year, the Vatican launched its \u201cClick to Pray\u201d app with thrice-a-day reminders and a feature allowing users to ask for others\u2019 prayers.\n\nLast year, the Vatican even unveiled a game inspired by the wildly popular augmented reality game Pok\u00e9mon Go. Rather than collect Pok\u00e9mon characters, users answer philosophical questions to gather up saints and people from the Bible.\n\nVatican officials have also described extensive efforts to modernize the Church\u2019s communications, discussing plans for a \u201ccentral content hub\u201d following a \u201cDisney business model\u201d allowing content to be more easily shared across platforms.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe hope that by Easter we will have one new portal for all these different operations, with new software for the multimedia platform that will have texts, images, video and [digital audio] news, as well as podcasts,\u201d Dario Edoardo Vigan\u00f2, then-head of the Vatican\u2019s new Secretariat for Communication, told America magazine in 2017.\n\nAD\n\nSchmalz believes the Church has a ways to go if it wants to catch up to many other faiths with tech-savvy. He pointed to Evangelical Christians as a similarly conservative group whose leaders and members are \u201cmuch more comfortable using new media and new forms of disseminating the faith.\u201d\n\nBut Catholicism has a long history of adapting to new technologies, he said, going back to the revolutionary invention of the printing press in the 15th century.\n\n\u201cThis is a user-friendly way to introduce people or reintroduce them to an important part of Catholic piety,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Made of 10 dark beads and a \u201csmart cross\u201d to store data, the $110 rosary is wearable as a bracelet and syncs up with what Vatican News calls \u201cthe official prayer app of the Pope\u2019s Worldwide Prayer Network.\u201d", "authors": ["Hannah Knowles", "General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/BozDuCYPs3TchaB_mMC66r5TVMw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B7JZLCHQ6AI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
