Perry became a target for the probe when a whistleblower report noted that he substituted for Vice President Mike Pence as the head of the U.S. delegation to the inauguration of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said she didn\u2019t discuss Perry\u2019s role in the unfolding Ukrainian scandal nor reports of his forthcoming departure from the administration when she saw him in Iceland last week. She also declined to state whether he should comply with the Democratic subpoena as part of its impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something they\u2019re all trying to work through,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cThe administration has made pretty clear they don\u2019t think anyone should comply, but that\u2019s what they got to work through.\u201d\n\nHer Democratic counterpart, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), disagreed and said Perry should comply with the subpoena and added evading one is inconsistent Perry\u2019s character. The two men knew each other well while serving as governors of their states.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, everybody should comply with the subpoena,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not his character whatsoever [not to]. I know deep down he would want to do it.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/4e/cd/2bf5357b43bc998f1556d0aeaaff/191010-rick-perry-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
