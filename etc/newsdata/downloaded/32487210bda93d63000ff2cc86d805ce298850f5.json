Everyone\u2019s playing great. Everyone\u2019s just doing a lot better.\u201d\n\nHer return also holds significance in light of Williams\u2019 controversy-fueled final last year against upstart Naomi Osaka, which prompted vociferous debate and promises of introspection from tournament organisers.\n\nAsked by reporters about the 2018 bout, however, a laser-focused Williams responded that it \u201chasn\u2019t really crossed my mind\u201d.\n\nThe mindset is reflective of her renewed concentration, with the six-times U.S. Open champion reiterating throughout the tournament the Spartan-like preparations she underwent to prepare for the stout talent at Flushing Meadows.\n\nSept 5, 2019; Flushing, NY, USA; Serena Williams of the USA reacts after defeating Elina Svitolina of Ukraine (not pictured) in a semifinal match on day eleven of the 2019 U.S. Open tennis tournament at USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.

Yeah, I put a ton of time in. Worked a lot on my fitness,\u201d said Williams. \u201cIt always feels good to train without pain.\u201d\n\nAfter dismantling erstwhile rival Maria Sharapova in their highly anticipated first round, Williams has romped through the competition, save for a brief scare in her fourth-round match against Petra Martic, when she tweaked her right ankle.", "description": "Twenty years after an improbable run at the age of 17 to her maiden U.S. Open victory, Serena Williams is running out of records to break.", "authors": ["Amy Tennery", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426767583&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF850AJ", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
