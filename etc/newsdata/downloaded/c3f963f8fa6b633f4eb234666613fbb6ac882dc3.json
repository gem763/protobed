REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo\n\nThose added to the so-called \u201cEntity List\u201d include the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region People\u2019s Government Public Security Bureau, 19 subordinate government agencies and eight commercial firms, according to a Commerce Department filing. The companies include Zhejiang Dahua Technology (002236.SZ), IFLYTEK Co (002230.SZ), Xiamen Meiya Pico Information Co (300188.SZ) and Yixin Science and Technology Co.\n\nWhile U.S. officials said the announcement was not tied to this week\u2019s resumption of trade talks with China, the announcement sets the tone for a potentially more aggressive positioning by Washington in negotiations with Beijing to end an 15 month trade war between the world\u2019s biggest economies.\n\nReuters reported on the planned additions earlier Monday, before the Commerce Department made it official.\n\nThe department filing said the \u201centities have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China\u2019s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Government and Department of Commerce cannot and will not tolerate the brutal suppression of ethnic minorities within China,\u201d said Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross.\n\nThe list includes municipal and county public security bureaus and the Xinjiang Police College. In China a public security bureau is a municipal office responsible for law enforcement, fire prevention, traffic control, immigration control and other matters affecting public security.\n\nBeing added to the \u201cEntity List\u201d bars companies or other entities from buying parts and components from U.S. companies without U.S. government approval.\n\nThe Commerce Department previously added Huawei Technologies Co and more than 100 affiliates to the Entity List. The Huawei listing hurt many of its U.S. suppliers that depended on the world\u2019s largest telecommunications company for revenue and made it difficult for Huawei to sell new products.\n\nHikvision, officially known as Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co Ltd, with a market value of about $42 billion, calls itself the world\u2019s largest video surveillance gear maker. Reuters reported in August Hikvision receives nearly 30% of its 50 billion yuan ($7 billion) in revenue from overseas.\n\nHikvision did not immediately comment on the Commerce Department\u2019s move. The Chinese embassy in Washington also did not immediately comment.\n\nChina faces growing condemnation from Western capitals and rights groups for setting up facilities that U.N. experts describe as mass detention centers holding more than 1 million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims.\n\nIn April, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers urged the move against Chinese companies it called \u201ccomplicit in human rights abuses\u201d and specifically cited Hikvision and Dahua.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week at the Vatican that \u201cwhen the state rules absolutely, it demands its citizens worship government, not God. That\u2019s why China has put more than one million Uighur Muslims ... in internment camps and is why it throws Christian pastors in jail.\u201d\n\nJohn Honovich, founder of surveillance video research company IPVM, said Hikvision and Dahua both use Intel Corp (INTC.O), Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), Ambarella Inc (AMBA.O), Western Digital (WDC.O) and Seagate Technology (STX.O) as suppliers and that the impact on the Chinese companies would be \u201cdevastating.\u201d Shares in Ambarella fell 12% in after hours trading on the news.\n\nIn August, the Trump administration released an interim rule banning federal purchases of telecommunications equipment from five Chinese companies, including Huawei and Hikvision.\n\nThe ban was included in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) passed last year, and restricted the use of federal money to purchase telecommunications equipment and services and video surveillance equipment from \u201ccovered\u201d telecommunications companies, citing national security concerns.\n\nHuawei has repeatedly denied it is controlled by the Chinese government, military or intelligence services and has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government\u2019s restrictions.", "description": "The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday put 28 Chinese public security bureaus and companies - including video surveillance company Hikvision <002415.SZ> - on a U.S. trade blacklist over Beijing's treatment of Uighur Muslims and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438244473&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF961JP", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
