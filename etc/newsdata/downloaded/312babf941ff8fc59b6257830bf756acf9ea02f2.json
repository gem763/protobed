The premium satellite service DirecTV is rumored to be a prime candidate for a sell-off as its subscriber base continues to erode.\n\nAT&T also reported a loss of 195,000 AT&T TV Now streaming customers.\n\nThe results were worse than the company had forecasted. AT&T was expecting to lose more than 1 million TV subscribers in the third quarter amid increased competition from digital streaming services.\n\nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson told Wall Street analysts on Monday that there are \u201cno sacred cows\u201d when it comes to the company\u2019s portfolio of businesses. He revealed a three-year plan that includes selling up to $10 billion worth of businesses next year.\n\nThe proceeds are expected to be used to pay off debt from AT&T\u2019s historic acquisition of Time Warner last year, which brought such media properties as CNN, Warner Bros. and HBO into its corporate fold.\n\nStephenson\u2019s comments come as AT&T is fending off aggressive rhetoric from activist investor Elliott Management, which has pressured the company to halt its acquisitions and add board members. AT&T said Monday that it will add two board members.\n\nThe company is betting heavily on HBO Max, the digital entertainment streaming service that is expected to launch next year. The service will compete with Netflix as well as a host of new streaming services like the upcoming Disney+ and Apple TV+.\n\nCord-cutting continues to ramp up as American consumers grow increasingly wary of costly cable and satellite bundles.\n\nThe Leichtman Research Group said in a recently published study that the largest pay-TV providers in the U.S., which represent about 93 percent of the market, lost about 1.5 million net video subscribers in the second quarter, compared to a net loss of about 420,000 subscribers in the same period last year.\n\nBreitbart previously reported that last year, the number of households who cut their cable or satellite television packages doubled to nearly three million, from 1.5 million cancellations in 2017.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.
