The city is seeking $130,000 reimbursement for the cost of the investigation that concluded Smollett was not the victim of a hate crime but had staged a hoax. Smollett\u2019s attorneys argued that even if that were true (which team-Smollett is still not admitting) he had no way to know that filing the report would result in such a massive and expensive investigation. In other words, \u2018It\u2019s not my fault you went crazy investigating my hate hoax.\u2019 Today a judge disagreed with that argument and refused to dismiss the case:\n\nIn denying Smollett\u2019s motion to dismiss, U.S. District Judge Virginia Kendall said that on its face, Smollett\u2019s claim that the police went overboard in investigating his report didn\u2019t hold up. \u201cThe natural, ordinary and reasonable consequence of a police report like this one \u2014 a racist, homophobic physical assault in which masked attackers invoked the President of the United States\u2019 official campaign slogan \u2014 is an intensive, sprawling investigation like the one that took place,\u201d Kendall wrote in an 18-page opinion made public Tuesday. She also pointed out that Chicago police took the allegations seriously in large part because of Smollett\u2019s high profile \u201cand the extreme nature of the accusations.\u201d \u201cMost crime victims do not have the opportunity to discuss the crime on \u2018Good Morning America\u2019,\u201d Kendall wrote.\n\nSmollett\u2019s attorney put a positive spin on the defeat:\n\nWilliam Quinlan, Smollett\u2019s Chicago lawyer, said in an email to USA TODAY that the ruling means the case will be \u201cdecided on the facts and not the pleadings.\u201d He said he was not surprised at the decision given that it\u2019s a \u201cvery high bar\u201d to get a case dismissed based on the pleadings. \u201cThe pleadings are just the city\u2019s side of the story. Now, Mr. Smollett will get to present his side of the case,\u201d Quinlan said. \u201cMr. Smollett has always maintained his innocence and is eager to have the complete facts of the case come out. He looks forward to taking depositions and otherwise bringing to light many of the facts that have been overlooked in the court of public opinion to date. \u201cMr. Smollett is confident that once the full story is available he will be vindicated.\u201d\n\nUm, okay. I think we\u2019ve already seen the evidence at this point. No one believes Smollett was attacked after midnight in freezing Chicago weather by two white racists who nevertheless were such fans of the black soap opera Empire that they could recognize Smollett on the street, in the dark. But purely as a matter of entertainment value, I look forward to hearing his attorneys offer their best attempt to make sense of all of that.\n\nAs it stands now, the case could go to trial next year. This is a civil case so only Smollett\u2019s money is at stake. However, a special prosecutor is still looking at State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx\u2019s decision to dismiss the 16 felonies Smollett was initially facing. If the special prosecutor decides the dismissal was improper (and there\u2019s some evidence it was) criminal charges could be brought against Smollett.", "description": "\"Most crime victims do not have the opportunity to discuss the crime on \u2018Good Morning America.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/smollett.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
