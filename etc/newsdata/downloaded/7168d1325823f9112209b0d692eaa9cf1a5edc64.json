Food delivery Uber Eats grew 72% to $595million.\n\nGross bookings, a measure of total value of car rides, scooter and bicycle trips, food deliveries and other services before payments to drivers, restaurants and other expenses, rose 31% from a year earlier to $15.76billion.\n\nAnalysts on average were expecting $15.80billion.\n\nAt the same time, Uber is keeping less money per car ride. The amount passengers spent on trips rose 20% while the amount Uber kept after paying its drivers increased just 4%.", "description": "The Uber Works app, made available only in Chicago for now, will show workers the available shifts in a certain area and help businesses that struggle to staff up during peak demand.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/16/19303048-0-image-a-14_1570202527778.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
