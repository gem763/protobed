One has to step back occasionally and ponder: Do adults of normal intelligence really believe this stuff?\n\nWe have heard from candidates the ideas of forgiving all student-loan debt; health care for everyone (including an unknown number of illegal aliens); seizure of all assault rifles; and even a $1,000-a-month check for every American. These notions are so far in left field that even elementary-school students must know we cannot pay for even part of the list.\n\nAt the same time, this crowd of candidates is conspicuously ignoring what is perhaps the most important subject to every voter: The economy. According to the U.S. Department of Labor Statistics, unemployment of African-Americans has fallen to 5.5 percent \u2014 the lowest rate since records have been kept; overall unemployment is holding steady at a record 3.7 percent; Hispanic joblessness dropped to 4.2 percent, also the lowest rate since records have been kept; and 6.3 million new jobs have been created since President Trump took office. That\u2019s 4.5 million more than predicted by the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe \u201cdebating\u201d Democrats desperately need some new fodder and should consider making these economic statistics the subject of the next debate. But on the other hand, that would not make for much of a debate.\n\nJAMES W. ANDERSON\n\nTalladega, Ala.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
