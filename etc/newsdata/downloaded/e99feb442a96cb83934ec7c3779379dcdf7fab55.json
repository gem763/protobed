protestors have been dragged from the top of trains by angry commuters after targeting the London underground this morning.\n\nParts of the Jubilee line shut down as fights broke out between passengers and climate activists who climbed on top of trains at Canning Town Station.\n\nToday\u2019s action comes ahead of a High Court hearing over a Met Police \u2018ban\u2019 on the group\u2019s disruptive style protests.\n\nBut who are Extinction Rebellion and what exactly are they aiming to achieve?\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

disobedience \u2018in an attempt to halt mass extinction and minimise the risk of social collapse.\u2019\n\nThey formed in the UK in October 2018 and say they now have groups all around the world including Spain, South Africa and India.\n\nThey hit the headlines in April when they launched a two week \u2018international rebellion\u2019 to urge governments around the world to take action on the climate crisis, leading to over 1,000 arrests and bringing parts of London to a standstill.\n\nTheir protests included blocking major bridges across the River Thames and super-gluing themselves to the gates of Buckingham Palace.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nWhat do Extinction Rebellion want?\n\nExtinction Rebellion have three demands for the UK.\n\nThey are: \u2018Tell the truth\u2019 by declaring a climate emergency, \u2018Act Now\u2019 to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025 and go \u2018Beyond Politics\u2019 by establishing a citizens assembly to combat climate change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA citizen\u2019s assembly would see people randomly selected from across the country, similar to jury service, to discuss and make recommendations on how to respond to the climate emergency.\n\nA protester hands out leaflets in the South Terminal at Gatwick Airport during an Extinction Rebellion (XR) climate change protest (Picture: PA)\n\nClimate activists protest outside the Supreme Court, during the eleventh day of demonstrations in London this month (Picture: AFP)\n\nWill their demands be met?\n\nIn May MPs voted to declare a climate emergency, but the group claim this is \u2018symbolic and non-binding\u2019.\n\nMinisters have also pledged to produce net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 but XR say that target is \u2018a generation too late\u2019.\n\nThe government also announced plans for a citizens assembly in June, but again the group said this did not go far enough, as members could only make recommendations.\n\nHowever, some climate experts have said the groups demands are unrealistic, particularly getting to zero emissions by 2025.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nResearchers at the Centre for Alternative Technology said for this to be achieved, flights would have to be restricted and people would have to drastically change their behaviour \u2013 such as eating less meat and changing how they travel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, co-founder of the group Gail Bradbrook say the government have left it so late to deal with the climate crisis that society has to step up in a \u2018semi-miraculous way\u2019.\n\nWhat have Extinction Rebellion been doing?\n\nTo highlight their message, XR protestors have glued themselves to trains, blocked traffic, chained themselves outside politicians\u2019 houses and planted trees outside parliament.\n\nActivists climb down from the awning over the Brazilian Embassy\u2019s entrance during Extinction Rebellion climate change protest in

their babies blockaded Google\u2019s London HQ calling for the tech giant to stop funding climate change deniers.\n\nExtinction Rebellion activists also stood outside YouTube\u2019s nearby Kings Cross offices in protest against them giving a platform to people who reject science on global warming.\n\nMeanwhile some 1,000 protesters sat down in Trafalgar Square in defiance of controversial Metropolitan Police ban on all of the group\u2019s demonstrations in the capital.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5

about their tactics to overwhelm the capacity of policy custody, including by refusing bail after being arrested.\n\nThey are encouraging people to risk going to prison so their demands can be heard.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
