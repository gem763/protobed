Such atrocious marketing ploy has to be shut down. Animals do not need to be subjected to such hideous marketing tactics,\u201d one commenter wrote.\n\n\u201cThis is very cruel. The crab will be dropped many times. Live creatures should be banned from such machines!\u201d said another.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a terrible way of killing crabs. Warped way to play with your food. Just get it on and serve some decent food will you? Is your food so bad that you have to resort to such cheap tricks?\u201d another wrote.\n\nBut critics are jumping to conclusions, House of Seafood CEO Francis Ng, 47, told Coconuts Singapore this afternoon, insisting that the machine had been designed to prevent causing the crabs any pain. (Editor: Yes, we\u2019re aware there\u2019s an ongoing debate over whether crustaceans feel pain as we know it.)\n\nThe opening on the bottom left of the claw machine, where customers claim their live crabs, is cushioned to support the animal\u2019s fall, Ng told us over the phone from China, while the claws also have a plastic covering designed to soften their grip.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I\u2019m sorry to all animal caregivers. We did not intend to use animals as play things \u2026 we clean the game machine every day and let them survive in a good environment,\u201d he said. \u201cMany children in restaurants like crabs but dare not touch it. I hope that in this way, more people would understand crabs better and love them.\u201d\n\nNg added that the idea behind the S$5,000 machine \u2014 which is in operation between 5pm and 10pm each day \u2014 was to educate the public on how to identify male and female crabs. We\u2019ll leave it to you to decide the worthiness of that ostensibly educational effort.\n\nMeanwhile, if NParks wish the machine be removed, Ng said he would respect their decision.\n\nThe live crab claw machine was introduced to customers on Oct. 13, according to the restaurant\u2019s Facebook page. Customers also have the option of keeping the crab at the Chinese restaurant and save it for eating another day, the page said.\n\nThis is not House of Seafood\u2019s first experiment with serve yourself machines. Two years ago it launched a chili crab dish vending machine, although there were no live crabs in that one.\n\nThe House of Seafood restaurant was founded by CEO Francis Ng in 2008 and first opened in Yio Chu Kang before launching its outlet at The Punggol Settlement cluster of seafront dining restaurants. House of Seafood also has outlets in Cambodia and Malaysia.\n\nNParks did not respond to requests for comment before publication.\n\nRelated story:\n\nAnimal abuse petition hits 50,000 signatures as Platinium Dogs Club raided and investigated\n\nThis article, UPDATE: Singapore restaurant accused of cruelty over live crab claw machine, owner says no pain involved, originally appeared on Coconuts, Asia's leading alternative media company.
