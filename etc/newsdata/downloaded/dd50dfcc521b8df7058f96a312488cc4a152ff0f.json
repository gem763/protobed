Amazon's profits dipped as it aimed to cut down delivery times.\n\nSeveral other stocks reported stronger results, however. Tesla and Microsoft showed they were faring better than expected despite the slowdown in global growth.\n\nResource stocks fuel ASX\n\nResource stocks led the gains on the local market this week, as metal and oil prices advanced.\n\nThe big iron ore miners were also supported by news that Brazilian miner Vale had temporarily closed its Itabiru\u00e7u tailings dam, prompting a cut to the company\u2019s full-year sales estimate.\n\nBHP climbed 2.8 per cent to $35.77, Rio Tinto 3.3 per cent to $90.81, South32 5.7 per cent to $2.60 and Fortescue Metals Group 6.4 per cent to $8.82.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe increasing likelihood that Britain would not leave the European Union without a deal on October 31 supported CYBG shares this week, sending them 9.8 per cent higher to $2.70.\n\nWhile British lawmakers blocked UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's efforts to push his deal through parliament by October 31, they voted in favour of a second reading of the deal, suggesting the divorce document has theoretical majority support.\n\nJB Hi-Fi reported a better than expected September quarter, recording strong like-for-like sales growth across its brands. The company said the federal election result and low interest rates had helped, and its shares closed the week 10 per cent higher at $37.19.\n\nThe big banks were slightly firmer this week. Commonwealth Bank climbed 1.3 per cent to $80.70, Westpac 0.7 per cent to $29.05, NAB 1.5 per cent to $29.18 and ANZ 1 per cent to $28.03.\n\nWiseTech's woes continue\n\nWiseTech Global shares fell heavily during the week after J Capital Research released a second scathing report on the tech company.\n\nWiseTech rebutted the central claim of the report \u2013 that it had made a series of \"disastrous\" acquisitions to maintain a facade of high growth and was failing to properly integrate the purchased firms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIts shares closed the week 12.1 per cent lower at $26.37.\n\nWhile WiseTech's fall was the heaviest, tech stocks were whacked across the board this week, as J Cap's report only added to bearish sell-side research and dampened sentiment across the sector.\n\n\"No one wants the fear of missing out to become the pain of not getting out when the growth company that has been priced to perfection hits an inevitable soft patch,\" said Bruce Apted, State Street head of portfolio management for Australia Active Quantitative Equities.\n\nAppen shares dropped 6.4 per cent to $21.52, Bravura Solutions 5.7 per cent to $3.80, Xero 4.1 per cent to $67.00 and Nearmap 5.8 per cent to $2.78.\n\nTreasury Wine Estates shares fell heavily at the start of the week after chief executive Michael Clarke announced that he would step down from his role in September 2020.\n\nMr Clarke joined the company in early 2014 and is credited with turning Treasury from a perennial underperformer to an ASX darling. Its shares closed the week 3.1 per cent lower at $18.02.", "description": "This is the first time since July that the market has closed all five sessions of the week in the green.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5295%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/75d7b6047b276bb599ef9ce83b699d4c86ae8a15", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
