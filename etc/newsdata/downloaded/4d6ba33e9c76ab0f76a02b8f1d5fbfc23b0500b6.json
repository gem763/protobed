I remember I was a White House correspondent, and I got the alert around 9:30 on a Sunday night, and we had to run in, and he gave us the news as soon as he could give us the news \u2014 the country the news.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThis information happened, this happened last night. And there is no reason to announce it at 9:00 a.m. and to delay the announcement that we\u2019re now almost 20 minutes into the 9:00 a.m. hour and we were told this would start at 9:00 a.m. unless, of course, the president is trying to have a big build-up. This is the showmanship we know he appreciates. This is part of this. And given the fact that so much of what the Sunday shows are \u2014here he comes. Here is President Trump 20 minutes late with a big announcement.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Sunday's broadcast of CNN's \"State of the Union,\" host Jake Tapper complained about President Donald Trump's announcement on the death Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS being 20 minutes late. | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/02/Tapper214-e1552503776422.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
