Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamFacebook Green New Deal ad tests Ocasio-Cortez's concerns about the platform McConnell blasts impeachment inquiry as 'kangaroo court' in fundraising pitch Russia calls increased US military presence in Syrian oil fields 'banditry' MORE (R-S.C.) has rolled out a resolution condemning Democrats\u2019 secretive process, but it\u2019s non-binding, meaning it will have no teeth or effect.\n\nThe GOP's \u201cthrow-everything-at-the-wall\u201d strategy underscores the party's disadvantage in the impeachment fight \u2014 for now \u2014 as House Democrats flex their muscle and demonstrate the power that comes with holding the majority: They control the impeachment process, determine which witnesses to call, blast out subpoenas and set the calendar.\n\nDemocrats \u201ccontrol the flow of access and information. That\u2019s the benefit of winning elections,\u201d said one House GOP aide close to the impeachment fight.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 probe has produced powerful testimony from multiple State and national security officials that has painted a scathing picture of Trump and his allies withholding nearly $400 million in security aid from Ukraine until its government agreed to launch investigations into the president\u2019s political rivals.\n\nSome rank-and-file Republicans privately have expressed frustration with Trump and the White House over a lack of long-term, overarching impeachment strategy. A recent White House strategy session between Trump and his staunch congressional allies produced little in the way of an impeachment game plan that could be shared with GOP members on Capitol Hill.\n\nAnd while Trump has the bully pulpit, GOP allies argue, he doesn\u2019t have a team in place dedicated to fighting Democrats\u2019 month-old impeachment inquiry.

But Mulvaney has been on thin ice ever since he admitted in a televised news conference the White House engaged in a quid pro quo, contradicting Trump on Ukraine; Mulvaney later walked back the comments.\n\nWord leaked out Friday that the White House is considering hiring former Treasury Department spokesman Tony Sayegh or former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi to lead communications and messaging efforts on the impeachment battle, which could stretch into December or January.\n\nBut Trump seemed to pour cold water on that idea, telling reporters hours later that he doesn\u2019t need a \u201cteam\u201d to fight back against the Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have teams. Everyone\u2019s talking about teams. I\u2019m the team. I did nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nWhat Trump has instructed his GOP allies to do is to get more aggressive against Democrats. At a Cabinet meeting, he called on Republicans \u201cto get tougher and fight\u201d back against impeachment.\n\nRepublican lawmakers did just that the very next morning.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nProtesting what they complained was Democrats\u2019 secretive impeachment process, a brigade of roughly three dozen GOP lawmakers stormed the secure room in the Capitol basement \u2014 known as the SCIF \u2014 and disrupted the deposition of a key Defense official for hours.\n\nThe publicity stunt, led by Trump loyalist Rep.

Several told The Hill they deliberately decided to skip the protest, and others raised concerns about lawmakers bringing their cellphones into a secure room where classified national security issues are discussed. Rep. Mark Meadows Mark Randall MeadowsDuring deposition, official says he made several efforts to advocate for Marie Yovanovitch Schiff says committees are making 'rapid progress' in impeachment probe State Dept. official broached Pompeo's role in Ukraine in new testimony MORE (R-N.C.), who had been listening to the deposition, later said he collected his colleagues\u2019 devices and brought them outside the room.\n\n\u201cIf anybody brings a phone in, that\u2019s a problem,\u201d said Alabama Rep. Mike Rogers Michael (Mike) Dennis RogersGOP vows to take new steps to protect Trump Hillicon Valley: Warren takes on Facebook over political ads | Zuckerberg defends meetings with conservatives | Civil liberties groups sound alarm over online extremism bill Civil liberties groups sound alarm over online extremism bill MORE, the top Republican on the Homeland Security Committee, who\u2019s spent countless hours in the SCIF.\n\nSchiff has vowed that the next phase of the impeachment process will be public, televised hearings, which will occur as soon as mid-November. Some Republicans are making the case that their party needs to think beyond one-off publicity stunts that draw attention to how Democrats are shutting out the public.\n\n\u201cThere will be a public fight that plays out, so you need a substantive argument,\u201d said one GOP source.\n\nOne senior GOP aide said Friday there are \u201cinternal talks\u201d about protesting and disrupting the next round of hearings this week. Lawmakers are vowing to continue fighting, though no final decision has been made on next steps.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t disclose anything right now. But we aren\u2019t done fighting back,\u201d Rep.
