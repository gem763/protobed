His total package including unvested share rights weighed in at a more substantial $1.23 million.\n\nUnder the terms of his contract, he is no longer eligible for a short-term bonus but his long-term incentives in the future are equal to 100 per cent of his $1.2 million fixed salary.\n\nKelaher, who resigned after a widely criticised appearance at the royal commission and the prudential regulator's decision to launch legal action, took home a salary of $1.3 million and a termination payment of $1.27 million after he quit in April.\n\nUnvested shares\n\nThe remuneration committee also said it would \u201creserve\u201d its decision on 72,052 unvested shares awarded to him in the 2017 and 2018 financial years, which are worth $546,882 at the current price.\n\nNon-executive directors at IOOF have escaped any penalty but the board did elect to hold directors' fees steady for the next 12 months. Directors are paid from a pool of $1.25 million.\n\nChairman Allan Griffiths was upbeat about the prospects for the firm, saying the changes under way would put the company at the forefront of the sector.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the work being undertaken will leave us with a governance model that is best practice within the industry. We have taken very positive steps to improve relationships with all stakeholders, particularly with our regulators,\u201d Mr Griffiths said.\n\nThe annual report arrived on the same day the corporate regulator imposed additional licence conditions, requiring IOOF to appoint a majority of independent directors with \u201crelevant\u201d skills and experience, as the firm bedded down the acquisition of ANZ\u2019s pensions and investments business.\n\nASIC commissioner Danielle Press said the regulator was \u201cserious about improving the quality of governance and conflicts management\u201d in the industry and would use its power to protect consumers from \u201cthe risk of poor conduct or vulnerabilities to conflicts of interest\u201d.", "description": "The divisive wealth management company has cancelled top executives' short-term bonuses because of the poor share price performance.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7771%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_293%2C$y_256/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/357debeff0211ee2a6dc3d476d981c645107beaf", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
