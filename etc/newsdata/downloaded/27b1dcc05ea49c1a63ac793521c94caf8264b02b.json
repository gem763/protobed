The board is expected to discuss the prospect as soon as this week.\n\nThe palace intrigue at one of the world\u2019s largest startups echoes the chaos surrounding Uber Technologies Inc., when the board orchestrated the removal of co-founder Travis Kalanick two years ago. At Uber, after a scandal-plagued year, board member Bill Gurley of Benchmark helped force Kalanick\u2019s resignation, with participation from other investors. Today, the story unfolding at WeWork includes some of the same cast members: Bechmark is a major WeWork investor.\n\nFactions are now forming around the decision of whether to try to remove Neumann, 40, whose outsized personality has been a driving force behind WeWork\u2019s parent company, We Co. It\u2019s also possible that Neumann could benefit financially from stepping down, if some board members\u2019 calculation is correct that the company would be worth more without him. Uber\u2019s Kalanick made a fortune from his departure, with a net worth today of $4.2 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nSoftBank Group Corp.\u2019s Masayoshi Son, founder of the Japanese conglomerate, is among those pushing for Neumann to resign, as the startup seeks to salvage its initial public offering, a person familiar with the matter said. WeWork\u2019s rocky IPO preparations came at a particularly sensitive time for SoftBank, WeWork\u2019s largest investor, as it works to raise a second $108 billion Vision Fund.\n\nSoftBank expects Benchmark to be aligned with its position on Neumann, one person said. SoftBank has two representatives on WeWork\u2019s board and Benchmark has one.\n\nRepresentatives for WeWork, SoftBank and Benchmark declined to comment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Uber-scale mess,\u201d said Kellie McElhaney, a professor at the University of California Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business, who blames both the board and Neumann for not learning from that company\u2019s earlier mistakes. \u201cHe\u2019s really taken a first-mover advantage that WeWork had in the space and blown it in a big way.\u201d\n\nThe overthrow of Kalanick at Uber could offer lessons for the situation at WeWork. Benchmark sought to drive Kalanick out with help from the courts and other major investors. The VC firm sued Kalanick, accusing him of defrauding investors, and threatened to publicly air claims of mismanagement. Kalanick agreed to resign in 2017 after a confrontation with two Benchmark partners at a hotel in Chicago. Benchmark\u2019s lawsuit was dropped the next year.\n\nIn both cases, investors\u2019 machinations have been complicated by the founders\u2019 power within their companies. Kalanick wielded control over Uber by holding stock with strong voting rights, similar to Neumann\u2019s. At Uber, the board effectively stripped Kalanick of that power by changing the structure of the shares, so that when the company went public, all its shares were worth one vote each. Neumann, too, has disproportionate power over WeWork that is being whittled down. When the company first filed to go public, it did so with an unusual three-class share system that gave Neumann the vast majority of the voting power. Following backlash over governance issues from investors, it reduced the power of the high-vote stock to 10 votes per share, from 20.\n\nThough there are similarities between the controversies surrounding Kalanick and Neumann, the two men\u2019s methods are different. Kalanick came under fire for allegations of fostering a toxic workplace culture, including reports of sexual harassment by employees at the company. In contrast to Kalanick\u2019s hard-charging tactics, Neumann often speaks about \u201celevating the world\u2019s consciousness,\u201d and promoting a sense of community. But Neumann has drawn investors\u2019 ire for perceived self-dealing, including acting as a landlord to WeWork and profiting from a trademark on the company\u2019s name. (Those arrangements have been wound down.) Both CEOs have also faced blowback over the raucousness of company parties and the free-flowing availability of alcohol.\n\nWeWork\u2019s boardroom infighting not only imperils the IPO but also a $6 billion loan contingent on the deal. The unprofitable company must complete a successful stock offering before the end of the year to keep access to the credit facility.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- In a dramatic battle playing out at troubled unicorn WeWork, members of the company\u2019s board are considering calling for the ouster of Chief Executive Officer Adam Neumann, according to people familiar with the matter.
