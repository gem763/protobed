Taken as a whole, the moves offer a window into whether a company with a lower consumer profile but a deep content well can still win at a streaming game where branding is king.\n\n\u201cThe entire HBO service bundled together with larger new offering of original content plus a choice slate of acquired library programming,\u201d proclaimed Robert Greenblatt, chairman of WarnerMedia Entertainment and Direct-to-Consumer, in a presentation from the Warner Bros. studio lot in Burbank, Calif., before introducing a wide range of creators and show teasers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAT&T chief executive Randall Stephenson said, \u201cThis is not Netflix. This is not Disney. This is uniquely HBO Max.\u201d\n\nAfter making a number of executive moves earlier in the year under new owner AT&T, WarnerMedia in recent months has been releasing a torrent of content announcements. On Tuesday, the onslaught continued.\n\nMost notable was that HBO has ordered \u201cHouse of the Dragon,\u201d a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d prequel based on George R.R. Martin\u2019s \u201cFire & Blood,\u201d straight to series. Martin will co-create and executive produce.\n\nExecutives also said that \u201cSouth Park,\u201d the long-running hit on Viacom\u2019s Comedy Central, would get a new \u201cstreaming home\u201d at HBO Max. Episodes for the next three seasons will premiere on the service 24 hours after they air on regular TV. All 23 past seasons also will be available on demand.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d HBO Max chief content officer Kevin Reilly said succinctly.\n\nThe deal is possible because Viacom does not have a robust consumer streaming service in the way of other conglomerates.\n\nThe \u201cSouth Park\u201d news led a long list of additions Tuesday that also included five stand-up specials to be overseen by in-house late-night host Conan O\u2019Brien; development projects from Mindy Kaling and Issa Rae; a \u201cGreen Lantern\u201d series \u201cin space\u201d from in-house blue-chip producer Greg Berlanti; a slate of new family shows involving Looney Tunes and Hanna-Barbera characters; a science-fiction series from Ridley Scott; and library shows like the first three seasons of \u201cRick and Morty,\u201d which has long been in the Warner Media family. Other announcements were expected to unfold throughout the presentation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe offerings come in the wake of other deals announced steadily over the past few months. They include a return of the niche hit \u201cBoondocks\u201d; a wide range of documentary series; a number of shows from J.J. Abrams\u2019s production company; all 21 of famed Japanese animation company Studio Ghibli\u2019s animated features; a TV spinoff of \u201cGrease\u201d; a revival of \u201cGossip Girl\u201d; and library hits such as \u201cFriends\u201d and \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201d\n\nIn part, the announcements reflect the nature of the streaming wars, in which the race is on to amass as many weapons as possible, without even knowing how they\u2019ll fire or whom they\u2019ll target. Some of the new shows seem aimed specific competitors \u2014 the standup specials were a retort to Netflix, while the family series are a broadside to Disney \u2014 but many eschew specific strategy in favor of a general more-is-more approach.\n\nThe deals also are a way of keeping the company in the consumer consciousness. At a moment when Disney and Apple TV+ are marketing heavily \u2014 the traditional broadcast airwaves have been flooded with spots in the hope of converting those viewers \u2014 WarnerMedia wants to ensure it is not forgotten in the tumult.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut there is little way to know whether simply creating a wide array of shows \u2014 even if a number of them turn out to be hits \u2014 will bring in a lot of subscribers.\n\n\u201cA few great shows isn\u2019t what makes a streamer successful \u2014 it has to scale,\u201d said Dan Rayburn, an expert on streaming. \u201cIt also has to be simple and easy to use. And we\u2019ve not seen anything yet from AT&T that demonstrates either of these things is true.\u201d\n\nIt remains hard to know how much of this is additional content as opposed to simply content ported over. Many of the deals in the pre-streaming age might have found a home on TBS or TNT, networks Reilly long oversaw. A key question remains unanswered about HBO Max: Is it going to be much of the same under a new marketing package or a discrete programming operation?\n\nAD\n\nWhile a number of properties, from \u201cJoker\u201d to \u201cSesame Street,\u201d are high-profile, it also remains to be seen whether they\u2019re enough to compete with the megaliths Disney will regularly roll out.\n\nAD\n\nNonetheless, on Tuesday, WarnerMedia sought to make the case it could hold its own with content heavyweights.\n\nGreenblatt touted AT&T\u2019s reach as one reason it could.\n\n\u201cWhen you live in a world of dragons, like Netflix, Amazon and Apple, it feels very good to have one of yours in the game,\u201d said Greenblatt, the former NBC and Showtime executive who was hired by WarnerMedia earlier in the year.\n\n\u201cWe simply couldn\u2019t do this without a company of this scale behind us,\u201d he added.\n\nAD\n\nWarnerMedia chief executive John Stankey, a former AT&T executive, also appeared at the presentation to tout the company\u2019s reach.\n\nThe company said it expect 50 million HBO Max subscribers by end of 2025, which would be an increase of about 50 percent of the some 34 million HBO subscribers the company currently counts. AT&T chief financial officer John Stephens said the company expects about $5 billion in revenue by 2025; he did not offer a timetable for profitability.\n\nAD\n\nExecutives also took a few veiled digs at the competition.\n\nGreenblatt said HBO Max will \u201cremove a lot of the filler no one watches anyway\u201d and \u201cnever rely on algorithms to serve our customers the best programming,\u201d both clear references to Netflix.\n\nAD\n\nReilly said HBO Max will have \u201cthe largest selection of recent blockbusters available on any streamer,\u201d a claim Disney might contest.\n\nThe service\u2019s goal has been different from those of competitors. Unlike other firms, WarnerMedia doesn\u2019t have to persuade consumers to pay directly for content \u2014 they\u2019ve already been doing that for HBO.\n\nWhat the company needs to do is expand beyond the prestige realms of the pay-cable network, whose roughly 30 million consumers pale compared to Netflix, to Disney\u2019s potential base and to the mass-entertainment direction streaming is believed to be going.\n\nAD\n\nIn short, the issue is whether a company that has been very good at getting hardcore TV fans to pay them directly every month can get a lot of other people to do the same.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe question for HBO is can they take their direct relationship with their consumers and leverage that into something more like Netflix,\u201d said Raj Venkatesan, a professor of business administration at the University of Virginia\u2019s Darden School of Business who closely follows streaming. \u201cA lot of consumers don\u2019t have a relationship with HBO.\u201d\n\nThe matter is further complicated, he said, because the brand is seen as more prestige than populist.\n\nThe larger play for AT&T also remains different \u2014 and in question. Netflix is driven by subscription revenue. Apple is trying to boost device sales and app usage. Disney wants to push merchandising and other products.\n\nAT&T wants content to help persuade people to keep subscribing to its phone services.\n\n\u201cThe business model is totally different \u2014 they\u2019re trying to make sure subscribers don\u2019t churn out of wireless,\u201d Rayburn said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve not yet seen evidence a streaming service will do that.\u201d", "description": "HBO Max wants to win the streaming wars \u2014 with very different weapons.", "authors": ["Steven Zeitchik", "Reporter Covering The Business Of Entertainment In The U.S."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ZjeZBpffTFsQeuMmVJJtDyHMBaM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7VHPRMH2UEI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
