Not only is the conference left with far less money, it also has far lower viewership because cable and satellite companies aren\u2019t compelled by a partner like ESPN or Fox to take the Pac-12 Network as part of a bundle of sports networks. As a result, the Pac-12 Network, which was introduced seven years ago, is in only 18 million homes, less than a third of the audience for the SEC Network and the Big Ten Network, and about half of that for A.C.C. Network, which started in August.\n\n\u201cWe determined that we didn\u2019t want to sell the Pac-12 Network \u2014 there was anticipation that it would grow \u2014 and when the landscape changed, we\u2019d be able to negotiate a better deal and cash in,\u201d Ray Anderson, Arizona State\u2019s athletic director, said. \u201cThat\u2019s been a painful wait.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we hit it in 2024, we can reduce the gap significantly,\u201d Anderson added. \u201cThat being said, there is frustration that the money isn\u2019t flowing as quickly as it was originally promised.\u201d\n\nAmong the signs of distress: The Pac-12 has begun to seek private equity partners for its network, and Scott has urged the schools to consider occasional 9 a.m. kickoffs for home games beginning next season to take advantage of a national broadcast window on Fox.\n\n\u201cDifferent people will have different points of view,\u201d Scott said of the early kickoffs. \u201cBut I feel like it\u2019s my job to regularly think outside the box.\u201d\n\nTV revenue, Scott said, accounts for 25 percent to 40 percent of university athletic budgets.\n\nIn a conference that prides itself on the breadth of its athletic programs, particularly in the so-called Olympic sports, lower TV revenue translates largely into lower salaries, fewer staff members and fewer resources for the moneymakers: football and men\u2019s basketball.", "description": "The chasm is growing between the Pacific-12 Conference and its Power Five counterparts.
