Plus, Elizabeth Warren and the African American vote\n\nSubscribe now to receive the morning briefing by email.\n\nGood morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories.\n\nTrump administration draws battle lines with Congress\n\nThe US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, on Tuesday dismissed summons from House Democratic committee chairmen for five current and former state department officials to testify about the Trump-Ukraine scandal amid an escalating impeachment inquiry. Yet despite Pompeo\u2019s claim that Democrats were trying \u201cto intimidate, bully, and treat improperly\u201d the officials, at least three have signalled their willingness to testify. Pompeo has only limited power to stop the congressional committees from gathering evidence for an impeachment inquiry.\n\nKhashoggi murder still roiling the Middle East, one year on\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An activist wears a mask depicting Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at a vigil for Khashoggi outside Saudi Arabia\u2019s consulate in Istanbul last year. Photograph: Emrah G\u00fcrel/AP\n\nA year since the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi assassins at the country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul, the fallout from the killing continues to vex the entire region, as the Guardian\u2019s Middle East correspondent, Martin Chulov, explains. Before Khashoggi\u2019s death last October, the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, was starting to overcome his country\u2019s doubters with a programme of reform. Today, he is isolated and weakened, and his relationship to the Trump administration under scrutiny.\n\nNo justice. Despite the outsized political impact of his death, Khashoggi\u2019s fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, says the Trump administration and the international community have still taken no direct action to bring his killers to justice.\n\nFormer Dallas cop guilty of murdering Botham Jean at home\n\nPlay Video 0:40 Dallas police shooting verdict a 'victory for black people in America', lawyer says \u2013 video\n\nThere were chants of \u201cblack lives matter\u201d in a Dallas courtroom on Tuesday, as a white former police officer was found guilty of murdering her black neighbour at his home last September after confusing his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger argued that she had a right to use lethal force when she shot dead Botham Jean, believing the innocent 26-year-old was an intruder in her home \u2013 only to later realise she had entered his property by mistake.\n\nHeld accountable. Guyger is the first Dallas police officer to be convicted of murder since the 1970s. The guilty verdict was hailed by the Jean family\u2019s lawyer as \u201ca victory for black people\u201d and a signal that \u201cpolice officers are going to be held accountable for their actions.\u201d.\n\nAnti-terror centre helped police track environmental activists\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A protest against the Keystone XL pipeline in Rapid City, South Dakota this summer. Photograph: Adam Fondren/AP\n\nA federally sponsored anti-terrorism centre in Oregon helped a taskforce that was monitoring environmental protest groups in the state, according to documents obtained by the Guardian. The Oregon Titan Fusion Center, part of a national network established to monitor terrorist activities after 9/11, shared information with the South-western Oregon Joint Task Force, which was surveilling opponents of the $10bn Jordan Cove energy project. The ACLU and other observers argue that such activities break Oregon law.\n\nState cooperation. The leaders of 45 international, national and Oregon-based environmental groups have written to the state\u2019s governor, Kate Brown, urging her to withdraw state cooperation from any such surveillance of activists.\n\nCheat sheet\n\nMust-reads\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Warren at a campaign rally in New Hampshire last week.

But she still has work to do if she wants to wrest African-American support from the former vice president, as Lauren Gambino reports.\n\nGrowing up in America\u2019s murder capital\n\nIn a city where 13 black children were killed with guns this summer alone, being close to home and family is still no guarantee of safety. Lauren Aratani reports from St Louis on what it\u2019s like to grow up \u2013 and to raise children \u2013 in the country\u2019s murder capital.\n\nMigrant workers killed by heat in Qatar\n\nAs construction ramps up ahead of the 2022 World Cup, the Guardian has found that hundreds of migrant labourers are dying of heat stress every year, after being forced to work in searing temperatures. Pete Pattison spoke to the family and co-workers of one such victim, 24-year-old Rupchandra Rumba.\n\nThe opioids \u2018cartel\u2019 in a small West Virginia town\n\nThe epicentre of America\u2019s opioids epidemic might just have been Mingo County, an otherwise quiet, rural region of West Virginia. Chris McGreal learns how the tiny town of Williamson was home to what police call a \u201ccartel\u201d of doctors, pharmacists and drug firms.\n\nOpinion\n\nThe Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, was dragged into the Trump impeachment scandal after visiting Washington last week. But Australians seem to think a strong relationship with the US remains more important than who is in the White House, says pollster Peter Lewis.\n\nWhile just one-third of Australians believe the Trump presidency has been good for Australia, that does not mean that a good relationship with Morrison reflects poorly on him.\n\nSport\n\nMauricio Pochettino has admitted his Tottenham team \u201cgave up a little bit\u201d in the second half of a brutal 2-7 home defeat to Bayern Munich on Tuesday night, with the former Arsenal winger Serge Gnabry scoring four to compound the humiliation. Elsewhere in the Champions League, Manchester City beat Dinamo Zagreb while PSG and Juventus topped their respective groups.\n\nYoung cyclists in Colombia risk life and limb by racing downhill on customised bikes at speeds of up to 77mph, a sport known as gravity biking. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of life for anyone who lives up in the communes,\u201d one teenage competitor tells Joe Parkin Daniels in Medell\u00edn.\n\nSign up\n\nThe US morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.
