Analysts had similar estimates, but BA declined to comment on the cost incurred.\n\nThe airline dismissed a new offer by BALPA last week as an \u201celeventh hour inflated proposal\u201d that was not made in good faith. BALPA had said it would have called off the strikes this week if BA had engaged with the offer.\n\nBA\u2019s Cruz said the 11.5% offer was \u201cway above\u201d inflation, which stood at 2.1% in July, and already recognized that BA was making money.\n\n\u201cThe commitment of everyone at British Airways is to get over this particular dispute as quickly as possible and we urge the union to sit down with us as quickly as we can so we can reach an agreement,\u201d Cruz told BBC radio.\n\nHe said it was a BA dispute and it would be resolved by the carrier rather than IAG.\n\nSETBACK\n\nThe strike is the latest setback for BA, which in August suffered its third major computer failure in little more than two years, disrupting flights in its peak travel period.\n\nIt also faces a record $230 million fine under tough new data-protection rules after the theft of data from 500,000 customers from its website last year.\n\nAnd it has been harder hit by industrial action than Ryanair, which reported no travel disruption after its British-based pilots went on strike this month.\n\nBritish Airways, however, said it had no detail from BALPA on which pilots would strike, and had no way of predicting how many would come to work or which aircraft they are qualified to fly, so had no option but to cancel nearly 100% of its flights.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A British Airways Airbus A320-200 aircraft sits on the tarmac at Heathrow Airport in London, Britain January 8, 2019.

During the strikes, it must offer reimbursement for canceled flights, alternate travel arrangements under comparable conditions or a new flight at a later date.", "description": "Nearly all British Airways (BA) flights were grounded by its first ever pilots strike on Monday, disrupting the travel plans of thousands of passengers in a dispute over pay.", "authors": ["Paul Sandle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427753624&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF88001", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
