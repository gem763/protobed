PG&E announced the settlement agreement in principle earlier this month.\n\nLast week, bondholders, including Elliott Management Corp. and the official committee representing fire victims asked to put a chapter 11 plan on the table that would compete with the company\u2019s own restructuring framework. Bondholders must get court permission to formally file a competing chapter 11 plan.\n\nOn Monday, the California utility company said the Elliott proposal would cost all PG&E customers billions of dollars in additional interest payments over 15 years and provide an \u201cunfair windfall\u201d for noteholders and plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys.\n\n\u201cThat plan proposal is a blatant attempt to unjustly enrich the noteholders who proposed it,\u201d PG&E said in a press release.\n\nPG&E\u2019s chapter 11 plan that would cap the amount owed to wildfire victims at about $8.4 billion, and pay insurers and the people who invested in insurance claims stemming from the fires $11 billion. The settlement was negotiated with carriers that hold roughly 85% of insurance subrogation claims against the company.\n\nBondholders said last week that they can offer $28.4 billion in new money for about 59% of the reorganized PG&E. The rest of the equity in the postbankruptcy company would be put into the trust that would absorb wildfire claims.\n\nPG&E\u2019s plan is the second major agreement the company has reached with claimants. In June, PG&E agreed to pay $1 billion to local governments and state agencies to settle claims from fires in 2017 and 2018.\n\nWrite to Patrick Thomas at Patrick.Thomas@wsj.com", "description": "PG&E said it has formalized an $11 billion settlement with insurance companies over wildfire claims.", "authors": ["Patrick Thomas", "Patrick.Thomas Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109793/social", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
