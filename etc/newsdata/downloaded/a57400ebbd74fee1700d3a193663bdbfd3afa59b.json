A second rebuff for a French nominee would likely further delay the start of the new Commission and raise more serious questions over the judgment of both Macron and von der Leyen.\n\n\"He has very solid experience in the main components of the portfolio, namely all the economic issues regarding the market, industry, digital and also a bit on space and defense\" \u2014 Elys\u00e9e official on Thierry Breton\n\nThe French government portrayed Breton as the ideal fit for the beefed-up internal market portfolio, which is slated to span technology, defense, space and industrial policy.\n\n\"He has very solid experience in the main components of the portfolio, namely all the economic issues regarding the market, industry, digital and also a bit on space and defense,\" said an Elys\u00e9e official.\n\n\"He was minister of the economy and in that capacity he worked on economic and industrial policies at the European level so he got to know [EU] institutions in this context,\" the official said. \"He is a renowned business leader, he ran big corporations ... He is a man of action who knows how to carry out projects.\"\n\nBut it is precisely that background in the private sector that may give Breton trouble when his nomination is scrutinized by the European Parliament.\n\nFrench anti-corruption NGO Anticor indirectly targeted Breton in a legal complaint linked to both his political and corporate activities.\n\nThe French delegation of the Socialists & Democrats group in Parliament gave a foretaste of the reception Breton may face from MEPs with a statement that declared his business career raised \"numerous questions.\"\n\nMacron, however, pushed back strongly against such concerns.\n\n\"If you start to say we can no longer give public responsibilities to someone who accepts to greatly reduce his salary \u2014 to go from running a listed company that is very successful to become European commissioner \u2014 if it\u2019s enough to have a legal complaint against you to no longer have access to these jobs, no one will be able to have access to these jobs,\" he said during a visit to La R\u00e9union, a French territory in the Indian Ocean.\n\nMacron stressed that filing a legal complaint was an easy step to take, requiring no proof of wrongdoing. \"I think we need to stay reasonable and not sully people as soon as they raise their hand,\" he said.\n\nVon der Leyen will meet Breton next week for a formal interview but, given that she has already consulted with the French president over the nomination, it would be a major surprise if she did not put him forward for confirmation.\n\nBreton would then be scrutinized first by the Parliament's Legal Affairs Committee, which will examine possible conflicts of interest. If he gets over that hurdle, he will face a three-hour confirmation hearing from members of the two major committees overseeing the internal market portfolio.\n\nThe French leftists' statement linked Breton to the Rhodia affair, a fraud case involving the French chemical company Rhodia between 1999 and 2004. They also cited a \"significant risk of conflicts of interest,\" as Atos has benefited from substantial amounts of EU funds.\n\n\"After Sylvie Goulard's crash, if President Macron thinks that Thierry Breton's hearing will be a formality, he's making a big mistake,\" the statement said.\n\nManon Aubry, a French MEP from the left-wing GUE group who sits on the Legal Affairs Committee, said that Atos received \u20ac107 million in EU funding in 2018. \"Macron again picked a candidate prone to conflicts of interest. I look forward to the hearing,\" she tweeted.\n\nHowever, much will depend on how leaders of the mainstream groups, especially the broader Socialists & Democrats bloc, respond to Breton's nomination. While the bloc's small French delegation was vocal in its criticism, overall group leaders largely stayed silent.\n\nBreton himself did not respond on Thursday to the allegations made against him. He issued only a brief statement at the start of the day, saying he was \"very honored\" to have been selected by Macron.\n\n\"After Sylvie Goulard's crash, if President Macron thinks that Thierry Breton's hearing will be a formality, he's making a big mistake\" \u2014 Statement from the French delegation of the Socialists & Democrats\n\nMacron will be relieved that the nomination got a positive initial reaction from members of the center-right European People's Party (EPP) group in the Parliament, which led the opposition to Goulard.\n\nChristian Ehler, the EPP coordinator for the Internal Market Committee, said \u201chaving an entrepreneur on board will allow a better link between public policy and the reality of companies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese two worlds need to go hand in hand for an effective EU industrial policy,\u201d Ehler added.\n\nHowever, EU officials and industry players said that if Breton is confirmed, frictions with Vestager could arise, as the two commissioners would have to work closely on industrial and competition policy but have expressed markedly different views.\n\nBreton is a defender of the French government's line on competition, according to which rules should be changed to allow large \"European champions\" to emerge that can compete on the global stage.\n\nVestager, on the other hand, nixed one such proposed champion \u2014 a Franco-German merger of rail companies Alstom and Siemens. She has argued that antitrust rules should not be waived as this would make for less competition within the EU.\n\nAsked by POLITICO for a comment on Breton's nomination after she had given a speech in Brussels, Vestager said, \"I don't know him so I have no comment whatsoever.\"\n\nMEPs from the liberal-centrist Renew Europe group, which includes Macron's party, lined up behind Breton.\n\nOn Twitter, group leader Dacian Ciolo\u015f praised his \u201ccreativity & extensive experience to move Europe forward.\u201d\n\nSt\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9, the leader of Renew Europe\u2019s French delegation described Breton as a \u201cconvinced European\u201d and stressed his credentials on tech and space policy.\n\nEarlier this year, Breton spoke before the French senate on \"digital sovereignty,\" comparing sovereignty over the \u201cinformation space\u201d with sovereignty over land, sea and air.\n\nMacron's pick was also welcomed by French startup lobby France Digitale.\n\n\u201cBreton\u2019s nomination is very coherent with the orientation the von der Leyen Commission wants to give to digital issues,\u201d said Nicolas Brien, the group's CEO. \u201cEveryone has received the message loud and clear, the priority will be digital sovereignty.\u201d\n\nSimon Van Dorpe contributed reporting.", "description": "New Commission pick risks clash with Parliament and tensions within EU executive.", "authors": ["Ma\u00efa De La Baume", "Laura Kayali", "Rym Momtaz", "Louise Guillot"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/h_55558118-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
