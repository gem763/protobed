ESPN announced an internal reorganization Tuesday under senior vice president of content Rob King, part of which includes ceasing publication of the magazine in September.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cConsumer habits are evolving rapidly, and this requires ESPN to evolve as well,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThe only change here is that we are moving away from printing it on paper and sending it in the mail.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOur journalists will continue to create the same exceptional content,\u201d the statement went on. \u201cOur data shows the vast majority of readers already consume our print journalism on digital platforms, and this approach will maximize our reach and impact.\u201d\n\nStaffers had heard rumors for several months that September would be the magazine\u2019s last print edition but were told this week that staffing levels would remain the same despite the change.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPeople are optimistic but pretty nervous about where it will be a year from now,\u201d said one current staffer, who requested anonymity to discuss internal ESPN business.\n\nAccording to two people with knowledge of the company\u2019s plans, there will be no immediate layoffs. The expectation is that a small handful of people will be out of jobs come the fall. Those positions will likely be in printing, circulation and publishing; editorial positions have been folded into other operations inside ESPN.\n\nAD\n\nThe magazine, the brainchild of former president Steve Bornstein, was launched at a time of ESPN\u2019s cultural dominance and was part of a strategy to expand the TV network into an all-consuming multimedia company. The magazine was headquartered in New York, the first major ESPN operation to be based outside of Bristol, Conn. \u2014 a move indicative of ESPN\u2019s growing ambitions.\n\nAD\n\nSkipper, who went on to serve as president of ESPN from 2012 to 2017, discussed the launch of the magazine this month on Simmons\u2019s podcast. Simmons is now CEO of the Ringer, but he got his start at ESPN and was one of the magazine\u2019s star writers for a time.\n\n20 Years Ago Today: ESPN The Magazine debuts with its call on the next stars in sports: Kobe, A-Rod, Kordell Stewart & Eric Lindros. pic.twitter.com/UreFy6f8kK \u2014 Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) March 23, 2018\n\n\u201cSteve Bornstein really had the vision that, \u2018Look, we\u2019re going to create a multimedia company,' \u201d said Skipper, who launched the magazine along with John Walsh, another former ESPN executive. \u201c \u2019We want to be in the radio business, we want multiple channels, we want a magazine.' Steve desperately wanted a weekly magazine to [battle Sports Illustrated].\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn the podcast, Skipper recalled the foundational vision of the magazine: a biweekly broadsheet bold enough to compete with Sports Illustrated and with the cultural heft of Rolling Stone. And it blossomed quickly. Skipper estimated the magazine was bringing in some $150 million in revenue in the mid-2000s and netting between $30 and $40 million per year.\n\nAD\n\nEditorially, it launched features like \u201cThe Body Issue,\u201d its answer to SI\u2019s swimsuit empire, while also earning a sterling reputation for long-form journalism. Feature writers such as Wright Thompson and Mina Kimes stood out; blockbuster investigations were delivered by brothers Steve Fainaru and Mark Fainaru-Wada; Don Van Natta and Seth Wickersham exhaustively covered the internal business of the NFL. In 2017, ESPN the Magazine earned a National Magazine Award for General Excellence, News, Sports and Entertainment.\n\nBut the cash-flush heady days dissipated as the economics of print journalism became increasingly difficult \u2014 at ESPN and nearly everywhere else. The number of annual issues of the magazine was cut to 20, then 16, then 12. Circulation for the magazine has never been higher than today, at some 2.1 million subscribers, but print advertising dollars dwindled sharply in recent years, and the magazine began losing money. (Sports Illustrated, for its part, has been for sale for the past year after the Des Moines-based Meredith Corporation bought Time Inc. and its magazines \u2014 Time, SI and others \u2014 in 2017.)\n\nAD\n\nESPN said it will consider releasing special issues of the magazine, such as \u201cThe Body Issue.\u201d And its magazine-style work will continue on its website, potentially with \u201ccover stories\u201d that include companion TV pieces. Such pieces could still carry the branding of ESPN the Magazine.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nAD", "description": "ESPN will cease publishing its flagship magazine in September, 21 years after it was launched.", "authors": ["Ben Strauss", "Sports", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/t2tMMU7ZF-3-IlJQbogvbKt4Xrw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/M24PDFXBEMI6RORQU7PNATMPVQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-30"}
