Situated on the Great Ocean Road, the house appears to balance precariously on a single steel beam overlooking the ocean.\n\nFamous with local passers-by, the Pole House in Fairhaven is an architectural wonder positioned in one of Australia\u2019s most iconic locations: the Great Ocean Road.\n\nThe coveted abode is accessible by a narrow 23m floating walkway, which in recent years has been decked out to include glass balustrades, crafting the sensation of walking on air.\n\nNot for the fainthearted, the home itself is raised some 40m above Fairhaven Beach and boasts unparalleled views of the 50kms of coastline extending from Aireys Inlet to Lorne and beyond.\n\nThe jaw-dropping, one-of-a-kind outlook influenced many of the structural decisions of the home, from the vertiginous wrap-around balcony to the floor-to-ceiling retractable glass walls on the ocean-facing side.\n\nThe mood of the home is entirely dependant on the external elements, but no matter the weather \u2013 be it warm and breezy or stormy and violent \u2013 Pole House is a safe haven from whatever chaos is taking place outside.\n\nFirst built in 1978 by architect Frank Dixon, the 64sqm timber structure corroded over time due to the harsh sea air, and in 2005, the property was sold to new owners with grand plans.\n\nThey sought out the help of Melbourne-based architect Franco Fiorentini from F2 Architecture, who stripped the home back and rebuilt it to modern standards whilst maintaining elements of the original aesthetic and design paved by the innovator before him.\n\nThe home\u2019s interiors are modern, moody and minimal; designed not to take away from the breathtaking views, but rather to accentuate and enhance them.\n\nA monochrome palette of white, black and deep wooden accents are utillised throughout, and no expense has been spared in ensuring the fit-out is as luxurious as possible.\n\nSome of the more notable features include a floating fireplace, reclining couches, mechanical blinds, and a wall of burnt ash timber to conceal the supporting steel pole.\n\nFrom a purely engineering standpoint, you might be wondering how the damn thing holds up; that one hulking steel pole carries the weight of the entire home. It may come as frightening news to some, but the structure is designed to sway like a tree up to 15cm.\n\nSo far, the home has outlasted three separate bushfires including the 1983 Ash Wednesday fire which tore through many nearby homes.\n\nAnd even now that it\u2019s been renovated to include more glass, the abode is tough and has the ability to withstand cyclone-strength winds.\n\nPole House is a short and scenic drive away from the Melbourne CBD. Ask any coastal holidaying Melburnian about their memories of the Pole House and they\u2019ll likely have a story to tell about spotting the structure from the car window during school holiday breaks.\n\nFor some, seeing the Pole House from the car window meant the beach holiday was close. To others, it was an opportunity to daydream and wonder what it could possibly be like to spend a night here.\n\nWell, daydream no longer, because a chance to live on the edge is here. Following the extensive renovations, the home now is able to be rented out at the average price of $668 per night.\n\nRead this next: An off-grid aluminium trailer that can easily sleep six", "description": "Welcome to Living on the Edge: The daring new series in which we feature epic homes around Australia balanced in precarious landscapes.", "authors": ["Few Cars Can Claim To Be As Iconic", "Recognisable As The Mini.
