The industry groups emphasized that governments should use all available mechanisms and negotiation forums, including the G20 Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity, to:\n\n\n\nEnsure the reduction of excess capacity;\n\nEliminate market-distorting subsidies and other support measures that contribute to excess capacity;\n\nUphold effective trade remedies to ensure a level playing-field driven by market forces;\n\nSupport stronger international rules against subsidies and preferences to state-controlled enterprises;\n\nEnhance transparency and cooperation; and\n\nCreate robust mechanisms to facilitate the exit of inefficient firms.\n\nThe industry groups commended the September 30, 2019 statement by Ulf Zumkley, Chairman of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s (OECD) Steel Committee, which expressed grave concerns about the unexpected growth of new steelmaking facilities in 2019, exacerbating global excess capacity and contributing to trade tensions. Participants in the OECD Steel Committee reiterated the need for further capacity reductions in relevant steel-producing economies and urged members to extend the G20 Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity past its current expiration in 2019.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful for the efforts made to date by the G20 and OECD governments to address excess capacity, and to support a playing field at the G20 Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity and OECD Steel Committee,\u201d the industry groups said. \u201cUnfortunately, effective reductions in capacity and concrete actions to remove government measures that distort markets, including raw materials markets, have not been adequate to date. Efforts by governments to eliminate practices that lead to excess capacity should be redoubled. We are hopeful that the diligent efforts of Japan, the current G20 Chair, are successful in extending the G20 Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity beyond 2019, and we urge all G20 and OECD steelmaking economies to pursue all vigorous means to obtain substantive results on the critical problem of steel excess capacity.\u201d\n\nThe steel industry groups issuing the call for urgent action include representatives of: Steel Manufacturers Association (SMA), American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), EUROFER (European Steel Association), Canadian Steel Producers Association (CSPA), CANACERO (the Mexican Steel Association), Alacero (the Latin American Steel Association), Brazil Steel Institute, Turkish Steel Producers Association, Republican Association of Mining and Metallurgical Enterprises (AMME), The Japan Iron and Steel Federation (JISF), European Steel Tube Association (ESTA), Korea Iron and Steel Association (KOSA), Specialty Steel Industry of North America (SSINA), South African Iron and Steel Institute (SAISI), The Cold Formed Steel Bar Institute (CFSBI), Association of Enterprises UKRMETALURGPROM (Ukraine), Russian Steel Association, Indian Steel Association, and The Committee on Pipe and Tube Imports (CPTI).\n\nContacts:\n\nSMA \u2013 Phil Bell, bell@steelnet.org , 202.296.1515\n\nAISI \u2013 Lisa Harrison, lharrison@steel.org , 202.452.7115\n\nCSPA \u2013 Catherine Cobden, c.cobden@canadiansteel.ca , 613.238.6049\n\nCANACERO \u2013 Salvador Quesada, squesada@canacero.mx , 52 (55) 5448-8162\n\nEUROFER \u2013 Charles de Lusignan, charles@eurofer.be , 0032 2738 79 35\n\nAlacero \u2013 Fernanda Valente, fevalente@alacero.org , (55 11) 3195-5803\n\nBrazil Steel Institute \u2013 D\u00e9bora Oliveira, debora.oliveira@acobrasil.org.br , 55 (21) 3445-6327 | 6300\n\nJISF \u2013 Shigeru Hagiuda, hagiuda@jisf.or.jp , 81 3 3669 4835\n\nRussian Steel \u2013 Maria Simonova, info@russtal.ru , 79153226225\n\nCFSBI \u2013 Mark Redding, mredding@bargrind.com , 630.868.1234\n\nTurkish Steel Producers Association \u2013 Veysel Yayan, veyselyayan@celik.org.tr , 903124663734\n\nESTA \u2013 Dominique Richardot, esta.dr@orange.fr , 33 1 41 31 56 45\n\nAMME \u2013 Alisher Zholdybayev, zholdybayev@agmp.kz , 7 7172 689 601\n\nSAISI \u2013 Charles Dednam, charles@saisi.org , 27 12 380 0900\n\nKOSA \u2013 Min-Chul Lee, minchul.lee@ekosa.or.kr , 82 02 559 3501\n\nUkrmetalurgprom (Ukraine) \u2013 Oleksandr Kalenkov, office@ukrmetprom.org , 0442790525\n\nSSINA \u2013 Larry Lasoff, LLasoff@kelleydrye.com , 202.342.8530\n\nCPTI \u2013 Tamara Browne, tbrowne@schagrinassociates.com, 202.223.1700\n\nIndian Steel Association \u2013 Arnab Kumar Hazra, a.hazra@indsteel.org , 919958599032\n\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/2802f37f-ead7-4f98-9d9b-3acfd7ff3c83", "description": "", "authors": ["Canadian Steel Producers Association"], "top_image": "http://www.globenewswire.com/Attachment/LogoDisplay/819883?filename=819883.png&size=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
