The city\u2019s leader aimed to sow divisions between the two camps in explaining her first conciliatory moves in months to try to quell social unrest.\n\nThat may not prove so easy in a city where polls show many people had turned against the government and police during the unrest, and anger is still running high.\n\nOn Thursday, explaining why she withdrew an extradition bill that kick-started a summer of dissent in the city, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said \u201csociety\u201d would like \u201cpeaceful demonstrators not to provide a legitimate basis for the really violent protesters.\u201d\n\nHer refusal to authorize an independent inquiry into how police have handled the protests, the opposition camp says, means neither of the opposition forces will be placated.\n\n\u201cIf you want to talk about violence, we need to deal with police brutality first,\u201d said Claudia Mo, convener of the pro-democracy bloc of legislators. \u201cIf they refuse to acknowledge or deal with police actions, there is very little we can do to proceed.\u201d\n\nProminent figures from the pro-democracy movement say those legislators are the most logical bridge between the protesters and the government. Ms. Mo said the elected group of lawmakers previously asked several times for meetings with Mrs. Lam in the past few months and were told it wasn\u2019t the right time, according to a number of lawmakers from the camp.\n\nNow that Mrs. Lam has said she is seeking dialogue, Ms. Mo will consult with allies on how best to proceed. Ms. Mo said it was unconscionable that the pan-democratic bloc wasn\u2019t invited to Government House to hear about Mrs. Lam\u2019s decision on Wednesday, even though dozens of pro-Beijing legislators were in attendance.\n\nWhat started off as a demonstration against a controversial extradition bill has become a series of massive protests with broad political demands. Here is why so many Hong Kongers keep taking to the streets in a leaderless movement and whether their goals can be achieved.

The extradition bill\u2014which would have allowed people to be sent to China for trial\u2014was initiated, introduced and now withdrawn by her government, she said. She added that Beijing has backed her administration throughout the process.\n\nChina\u2019s central government and state media have stayed relatively muted on Mrs. Lam\u2019s decision to formally pull the bill and initiate an independent review of Hong Kong\u2019s political, economic and social climate. As of Thursday evening, neither Beijing\u2019s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office nor the central-government liaison office in the territory had issued any public comment on Mrs. Lam\u2019s four-point plan for easing social tensions.\n\nAsked at a routine briefing Thursday whether Beijing had forced or advised Mrs. Lam to withdraw the bill, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters that the matter wasn\u2019t a diplomatic issue and referred the question to the \u201crelevant authority.\u201d The ministry omitted the question and Mr. Geng\u2019s response from its official transcript of the briefing.\n\nMr. Geng also warned U.S. politicians to stop meddling in Hong Kong\u2019s affairs, after Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) said Wednesday that the withdrawal was a \u201cwelcome but insufficient step after the government\u2019s violent response to the Hong Kong people\u2019s desire to protect their democratic freedoms.\u201d\n\nState broadcaster China Central Television hasn\u2019t referred to Mrs. Lam\u2019s plan in its evening newscast. On Wednesday evening, the government-run Xinhua News Agency ran a terse two-paragraph story on Mrs. Lam\u2019s plan, including the bill\u2019s withdrawal. The Communist Party\u2019s official newspaper, the People\u2019s Daily, published an identical report on the fourth page of its Thursday edition.\n\nIn contrast, when Mrs. Lam suspended the bill in mid-June, Chinese officials and state media weighed in within hours. Representatives of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and the liaison office expressed support for Mrs. Lam and her decision. CCTV reported on the suspension in its evening newscast on the same day, while the People\u2019s Daily ran a commentary the next day backing Mrs. Lam and her government.\n\nChinese censors have also appeared to curb social-media discussions of the withdrawal of the extradition bill. On the Weibo microblogging service, user comments on some state-media posts regarding Mrs. Lam\u2019s announcement were rendered unviewable.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting to life-and-death situations in Hong Kong,\u201d said Holden Chow, a lawmaker and vice chairman of the city\u2019s largest pro-Beijing party. Mr. Chow said he would like to see peace restored as soon as possible and urged pan-democratic legislators to condemn violence of any kind.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, said \u2018society\u2019 would like \u2018peaceful demonstrators not to provide a legitimate basis for the really violent protesters.\u2019 Photo: jeon heon-kyun/epa/Shutterstock\n\nChina is applying a well-worn Communist Party playbook for tackling public unrest, said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London.\n\nThe goal is to isolate \u201cthe activist protesters who resort to violence from the vast majority who prefer to demonstrate peacefully, and make the activist protesters look unreasonable,\u201d said Mr. Tsang. \u201cWhich then makes it appear justifiable for the authorities to resort to a higher level of repression that targets this group.\u201d\n\nBonnie Leung, vice convener of the organizers of the summer\u2019s biggest marches, said authorities were trying to drive a wedge in the movement. \u201cWhat we need is an olive branch, and what we\u2019re seeing is half an olive branch,\u201d she said, emphasizing the need for an independent inquiry into how police have handled the protests.\n\nMs. Leung said her group, the Civil Human Rights Front, is planning more protests, tentatively on Sept. 15 and on Oct. 1, the 70th anniversary of the founding of Communist China, though the march would focus on the Hong Kong movement.\n\n\u201cWe think all protesters\u2014the peaceful and the brave\u2014are all fighting for the same thing,\u201d she said. \u201cThese tactics to divide us won\u2019t work, and we will continue to be united and join together.\u201d\n\n\u2014Jeremy Page in Beijing contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Natasha Khan at natasha.khan@wsj.com and Chun Han Wong at chunhan.wong@wsj.com", "description": "For three months, Hong Kong protests have been sustained by two forces: the peaceful marchers, and the more radical activists.
