Later, President Donald Trump said he would be open (link)to a smaller-scale, interim trade deal. That came a day after Trump put off tariff hikes on $250 billion in Chinese goods for two weeks and China exempted more than a dozen U.S. products from new tariff hikes of its own.\n\nAlso Wednesday, the European Central Bank cut interest rates deeper into negative territory, as expected, raising hopes that the Federal Reserve may soon enact its own easy-money policies.\n\nJapan's Nikkei gained 0.9% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index advanced 0.2%. Malaysia's benchmark index was about flat while stocks rose slightly in Singapore and Indonesia . Australia's S&P/ASX was about flat.

That's what's changed.\"\n\nThe S&P 500 index rose 8.64 points, or 0.3%, to 3,009.57.
