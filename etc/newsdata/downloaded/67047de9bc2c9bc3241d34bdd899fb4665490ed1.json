Moreover, documents sought in the subpoena are protected by attorney-client, attorney work-product, and executive privileges,\" Sale wrote.\n\nGiuliani told Fox News he is parting ways with Sale, a former Watergate prosecutor, stating that unless Congress tries to enforce the subpoena, he won't need a lawyer.\n\nThree House committees conducting depositions this week to move the impeachment inquiry forward alleged that Giuliani \"pressed the Ukrainian government to pursue two politically motivated investigations\u201d against the former vice president and 2020 Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden and his son Hunter in exchange for foreign aid.\n\nMeanwhile, Pence's attorney, Matthew Morgan, rebuffed Congress' request saying the impeachment inquiry \"has been designed and implemented in a manner that calls into question your commitment to fundamental fairness and due process rights,\" he wrote in a letter to the three committee heads.\n\n\"Please know that if the committees wish to return to the regular order of legitimate legislative oversight requests, and the committees have appropriate requests for information in the custody of the Office of the Vice President, we are prepared to work with you in a manner consistent with well-established bipartisan constitutional protections and a respect for separation of powers,\" Morgan wrote. \"Until that time, the Office of the Vice President will continue to reserve all rights and privileges that may apply, including those protecting executive privileges, national security, attorney-client communications, deliberations, and communications among the president, the vice president and their advisors.\"\n\nWEEK FULL OF SUBPOENA DEADLINES TO TEST HOUSE DEMS' RESOLVE ON CONTEMPT\n\nIn addition, the House also subpoenaed the Pentagon and the White House Office of Management and Budget, for documents that explain why military aid to Ukraine was withheld in the days leading up to the July 25 call.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper said he will comply with the subpoena, despite protests from the White House.\n\nGeorge Kent, a senior State Department official who worked in Ukraine in 2015 and 2018, overlapping with both the Obama and Trump administrations, was deposed on Capitol Hill Tuesday for more than six hours behind closed doors, as House committees sought to determine what information he had about potential Ukrainian investigations.\n\nCongressional Democrats are in their fourth week of impeachment hearings against Trump, which center around whether he attempted to persuade Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Biden family for possible corruption in exchange for the release of that frozen U.S. military aid.\n\nDuring the July call, Trump said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump's reference to Biden and his son relates to the former vice president's insistence that Ukraine fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns centering on Shokin prompted his intervention.", "description": "President Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani told Fox News he will not\u00a0comply with a congressional subpoena to turn over all documents related to the phone call between Trump and Ukraine central to impeachment hearings against the president,\u00a0as the deadline for cooperating is set to expire Tuesday.", "authors": ["Vandana Rambaran", "Vandana Rambaran Is A Reporter Covering News", "Politics At Foxnews.Com.
