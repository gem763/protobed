It is completely debunked,\u201d said Bossert, who served as homeland security secretary from January 2017 to April 2018. He added that if Trump continues with that focus, \u201cit\u2019s going to bring him down.\u201d\n\nBossert\u2019s comments stood in stark contrast to attempts by Trump\u2019s allies to downplay a scandal that has sparked a formal impeachment inquiry, with the president\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and his senior adviser Stephen Miller both fiercely defending Trump on the Sunday news shows.\n\nBossert singled out Giuliani for pushing the Ukraine conspiracy theory and disparaged the former New York City mayor for repeating it to the president.\n\nGiuliani, who appeared on ABC after Bossert, denied ever supporting the theory, but he doubled down on a connection between Ukraine and Democrats, among other things.\n\n\u201cWith all due respect to Tom Bossert, he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d Giuliani said.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

They also issued a schedule of depositions for State Department officials named as playing a role in the Ukraine affair, which came to light because of a complaint from an anonymous whistleblower in the intelligence community.\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said on Sunday that the impeachment inquiry would focus on \u201cabuse of power,\u201d adding that it could include possible White House failures to comply with congressional subpoenas.\n\nWith the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees moving ahead with their inquiry, Democrats have discussed the possibility of pursuing \u201cobstruction of Congress\u201d as part of potential articles of impeachment against Trump.\n\nThe Intelligence chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), has confirmed that the intelligence community inspector general, Michael Atkinson, will testify in a closed session before his panel at the end of this week. And on Sunday, Schiff said on ABC that he had reached a tentative agreement with the whistleblower and his attorneys to appear before the committee \u201cvery soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is illegal, improper, a violation of oath, a violation of his duty to defend our elections and our Constitution for the president to merely ask for foreign interference in our election,\u201d Schiff told Stephanopoulos.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi and her top deputies, during a private conference call on Sunday afternoon, laid out a strategy for their offensive against Trump, including plans to streamline their messaging operation and help vulnerable lawmakers who face potential repercussions in their districts.\n\nBossert said he was cautious about the impeachment proceedings after seeing \u201ca lot of rush to judgment.\u201d It\u2019s far from proven, he said on Sunday, that Trump did anything to abuse his power and withhold aid to Ukraine in order to solicit its cooperation in an investigation of Biden, the former vice president and a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.\n\nThe president issued several tweets and retweets over the weekend attacking Democrats and the impeachment process, and also going after the whistleblower\u2019s credibility.\n\nINTERACTIVE: See where House lawmakers stand on impeachment\n\n\u201cThe Whistleblower\u2019s complaint is completely different and at odds from my actual conversation with the new President of Ukraine,\u201d Trump wrote on Saturday. \u201cThe so-called \u2018Whistleblower\u2019 knew practically NOTHING in that those ridiculous charges were far more dramatic & wrong, just like Liddle\u2019 Adam Schiff..\u201d\n\nSome of the president\u2019s allies amplified the criticism on Sunday, with Miller, the senior White House adviser, calling the complaint a \u201cpartisan hit job.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a deep state operative, pure and simple,\u201d he told host Chris Wallace on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\nEven though the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has said he has no reason to doubt the sincerity of the whistleblower or the inspector general who investigated the complaint, Miller branded the anonymous complainant a \u201csaboteur trying to undermine a democratically elected government.\u201d\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and one of Trump\u2019s strongest defenders in Congress, also cast doubt on the whistleblower and the entire Ukraine affair.\n\n\u201cThis whole thing is a sham. \u2026 Who is this whistleblower?\u201d Graham told host Margaret Brennan on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cWhat bias do they have? Why did they pick this whistleblower to tell a hearsay story? The transcript does not match the complaint. This thing stinks.\u201d\n\nHe also said he had \u201czero problems\u201d with Trump\u2019s July 25 phone conversation with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nBrennan asked what advice Graham gave the president when they golfed together on Saturday.\n\n\u201cKeep fighting back. We have your back on this,\u201d Graham replied. \u201cI am openly telling everybody in the country, I have the president\u2019s back because I think this is a setup.\u201d\n\nRandy Lemmerman contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/fd/6a/f513edbe48a48e07d234938738b9/20190929-tom-bossert-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
