Satellite image \u00a92019 Maxar Technologies/Handout via REUTERS\n\nMaxar\u2019s supplied image shows the tanker Adrian Darya 1 very close to Tartus on Sept. 6.\n\nThe ship appeared to have turned off its transponder in the Mediterranean west of Syria, Refinitiv ship-tracking data showed on Tuesday.\n\nThe tanker, which is loaded with Iranian crude oil, sent its last signal giving its position between Cyprus and Syria sailing north at 15:53 GMT on Monday, the data showed.\n\nThe vessel, formerly named Grace 1, was detained by British Royal Marine commandos off Gibraltar on July 4 as it was suspected to be en route to Syria in violation of European Union sanctions.\n\nTwo weeks later, Iran in retaliation seized a British-flagged tanker in the Strait of Hormuz leading into the Gulf.\n\nGibraltar released the Iranian vessel on Aug. 15 after receiving formal written assurances from Tehran that the ship would not discharge its 2.1 million barrels of oil in Syria.\n\nHowever, shipping sources say the tanker is likely to try to conduct a ship-to-ship transfer with another vessel for part of its cargo after Iran said a sale had been concluded.\n\nWashington has warned any state against assisting the ship, saying it would consider that support for a terrorist organization, namely, Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department blacklisted the tanker on Friday.", "description": "The Iranian oil tanker Adrian Darya 1 at the center of a dispute between Tehran and Western powers, which went dark off Syria earlier in the week, has been photographed by satellite off the Syrian port of Tartus, Maxar Technologies Inc., a U.S. space technology company said on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190907&t=2&i=1427157312&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8608R", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
