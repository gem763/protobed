NOK, -23.87% plummeted 22.5% on very heavy volume Thursday, putting them on track to suffer the biggest selloff in 19 years, after the Finland-based telecommunications giant warned of a profit shortfall as a result of 5G network challenges. The stock, on track for the first sub-$4 close since Aug. 30, 2013, was the biggest percentage decliner on the NYSE. Trading volume shot up to 72.4 million shares, enough to make the stock the most actively traded on major U.S. exchanges and well above the full-day average of 21.7 million shares. The stock was headed for the second-biggest one-day decline since it started trading in the U.S. in February 1991, behind only the 25.4% plunge on July 27, 2000. The stock has now lost 32.0% year to date, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.03% has gained 19.8%.", "description": "The U.S.-listed shares of Nokia Corp. plummeted 22.5% on very heavy volume Thursday, putting them on track to suffer the biggest selloff in 19 years, after...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
