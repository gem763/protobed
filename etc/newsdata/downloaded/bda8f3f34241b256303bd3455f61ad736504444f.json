She was 86.\n\nNewman\u2019s son, Adam, said his mother died Sunday of complications in New York from a longtime lung disorder.\n\nNewman won the 1962 Tony for best supporting actress in the musical \u201cSubways Are for Sleeping,\u201d where her costume consisted of a bath towel and which had lyrics co-written by her late husband, Adolph Green. She earned a second Tony Award nomination in 1987 for her performance in the Neil Simon play \u201cBroadway Bound.\u201d\n\nShe played Aunt Blanche in the Neil Simon play, then began a brief role in the ABC soap opera \u201cOne Life to Live.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was supposed to do just five episodes of \u2018One Life to Live,\u2019\u201d she told The Associated Press in 1988. \u201cI played Renee Devine, an ex-madame from Las Vegas who dressed to kill. The character just took off.\u201d\n\nHer other Broadway credits include \u201cOn the Town,\u201d \u201dAwake and Sing!\u201d and \u201cThe Prisoner of Second Avenue.\u201d She was standby for Judy Holiday in \u201cBells Are Ringing\u201d and replaced Barbara Harris in \u201cThe Apple Tree.\u201d\n\nHer television credits include starring opposite Alan Arkin in \u201c100 Centre Street,\u201d \u201dOz,\u201d \u201c\u201dComing of Age,\u201d \u201dMurder, She Wrote,\u201d \u201dthirtysomething\u201d and \u201cThe Jury.\u201d She was the first woman to be a guest host for Johnny Carson on \u201cThe Tonight Show.\u201d\n\nHer films include \u201cThe Human Stain,\u201d \u201dIt Had To Be You,\u201d \u201dFor the Time Being, \u201cA Price Above Rubies,\u201d \u201dThe Beautician and the Beast,\u201d \u201dMannequin,\u201d \u201dTo Find a Man\u201d and \u201cBye Bye Braverman.\u201d\n\nIn later years she focused on fundraising and founded the Phyllis Newman Women\u2019s Health Initiative of the Actor\u2019s Fund in 1996. Her work earned her the 2009 Isabelle Stevenson Award from the Tony Awards. She also hosted the annual benefit Breathless on Broadway to raise money for research to combat the lung disease pulmonary hypertension.\n\nShe started writing her autobiography, \u201cJust in Time: Notes From My Life\u201d after being diagnosed with breast cancer. \u201cI started writing it because I didn\u2019t want to talk about it. Not that it was a secret. After I had 50 pages down, Simon & Schuster bought it,\u201d she said in 1988.\n\n\u201cBetty Ford was an example for me in talking about my illness. I\u2019m getting some very terrific letters from women about it.\u201d\n\nNewman underwent one mastectomy and then had to have her second breast removed. She described it as \u201cno way to treat a lady.\u201d\n\nSoon after her recovery she went back to work, first in a one-woman show, \u201cThe Madwoman of Central Park West\u201d - which she co-authored with Arthur Laurents - then in \u201cBroadway Bound.\u201d\n\nIn addition to her journalist son, Newman is survived by her daughter Amanda, a Tony-nominated songwriter.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Phyllis Newman, a Tony Award-winning Broadway veteran who became the first woman to host \"The Tonight Show\" before turning her attention to fight for women's health, has died.
