Shouldn\u2019t really be something you really embrace.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry I didn\u2019t mean to make u insecure,\u201d the teen wrote back, and all Tengwall could do was laugh it off. The exchange was a classic example of the stereotypes many high school offensive linemen face on practice fields, in school hallways and on social media. Fat-shaming has long been associated with the position, and it can be especially cruel in the formative years of teenagers who are aggressively adding body mass in pursuit of college scholarships.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome researchers have warned that adding too much weight at such a young age could lead to health problems later in life, yet most high school offensive linemen aim to become as big and strong as possible \u2014 and also athletic and nimble enough to accommodate the growing demands of an evolving game.\n\nTengwall added more than 100 pounds between his eighth-grade year and sophomore year at Good Counsel in Olney, Md., where he grew into one of the country\u2019s best tackle prospects. But being 6-foot-6 and 300 pounds has also invited ribbing from teammates about his weight, and as harmless and sophomoric as it might appear, it has fueled a stigma that Tengwall is passionate about breaking.\n\n\u201cI feel like the misconception is that [offensive linemen] are fat, and that\u2019s something I didn\u2019t want to be at all,\u201d said Tengwall, a junior who is considering Penn State, Michigan and Notre Dame. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely hard for offensive linemen. You know, all the skill guys will show up and make fun of them, and they just think it\u2019s joking, but a lot of guys do get hurt from that, especially if they\u2019ve gotten teased before by someone else.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe\u2019s not alone. For some of the top offensive linemen in the D.C. area, there is a long list of challenges that come with playing a thankless position, but learning how to live with their growing bodies might be the most daunting.\n\nAccording to Trent Petrie, director of the Center for Sport Psychology at the University of North Texas, nearly three quarters of college athletes face pressure to change their weight, and those same pressures can start as early as high school \u2014 especially for offensive linemen hoping to earn college scholarships.\n\n\u201cFor a lot of these young men, there\u2019s more desire to become big and lean, as opposed to just become big,\u201d Petrie said. \u201cSo there\u2019s a double pressure.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt took R.J. Adams, an offensive lineman at Woodbridge High in Northern Virginia, a while to adjust to his weight gain. He entered his freshman season at 220 pounds and gained nearly 80 pounds over the following year; he currently measures 6-3 and 309 pounds. The Penn State commit said it took him a while before he felt comfortable at that size, but he usually pushes back against anyone who jokes about his weight.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a playful person, so I\u2019m going to retaliate,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t get sad or anything. \u2026 I like the way my body is.\u201d\n\nAnother top prospect, Oklahoma-bound Anton Harrison, started playing football in eighth grade as a tight end. He came to Archbishop Carroll in Washington for his freshman year at 6-3 and 270 pounds, and he was moved to left tackle. He was hesitant to grow even bigger, but his father and coaches taught him the \u201cdifference between good weight and bad weight,\u201d he said. He was put on a nutrition plan \u2014 at one point he was guzzling four protein shakes per day \u2014 and a weightlifting regimen that eventually shot him up to 315 pounds. He has not experienced fat-shaming, he said, but he has seen it with other players. He said that learning to love his own body was a process.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTenth-grade year, when I was gaining the weight and I really wasn\u2019t turning it into muscle, I was like pulling my shirt a lot walking around,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cYou know, things big men do walking around, hiding their stomach and chest and stuff. But now I walk around in tank tops, muscle shirts. It\u2019s a different confidence now, that you have to build.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThere are other risks to assess. The average weight of offensive and defensive linemen increased by more than 60 pounds between 1942 and 2011, according to Jeffrey Potteiger, a professor of exercise science at Grand Valley State. In 2016, Potteiger released a report that suggested college offensive linemen were becoming too large and were at risk for health issues, including high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome.\n\nFor high school offensive linemen, Potteiger said, \u201cthere\u2019s a little bit of a trade-off. They\u2019re physically active. They train a lot. They work out a lot. But they carry this excess weight. If it\u2019s too much body fat, it could be very problematic later on.\u201d\n\nTengwall weighed 185 pounds and was a wide receiver as an eighth grader, but he knew he would play offensive line in high school. He began to constantly drink protein shakes and scarf peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches a few times a day. He ate meat as much as he could and lifted weights twice a day. The work led to added pounds, and he weighed around 275 by the start of his freshman season.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe accepted the fact that weighing that much meant he would have to carry some fat, but he wasn\u2019t worried about the potential dangers of gaining that much weight so quickly, because he didn\u2019t use any supplements.\n\n\u201cIt was put on pretty crazy and pretty fast, but it was still natural,\u201d he said. \u201cThe quicker I got to that weight, the longer my body had to adjust to being that weight.\u201d\n\nMany young offensive linemen are racing to add as much weight as possible, which has led some teams to emphasize nutrition and education. At St. John\u2019s in Washington, where the offensive line averages between 280 and 310 pounds, the players\u2019 diets are monitored, and they are encouraged to compose food journals. No target weights are set, according to St. John\u2019s director of performance training Matt Smith, who also said that the team has installed preventive measures to avoid fat shaming.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe like to say, \u2018laugh with, not laugh at,\u2019 \u201d Smith said.\n\nAt Gonzaga, the offensive line has established itself as perhaps the most athletically gifted group on the team. It has four players going to major college programs \u2014 Penn State, N.C. State, Wake Forest and Virginia \u2014 and one of the group\u2019s proudest accomplishments was taking second in an intramural basketball tournament, which showed the entire school how athletic the linemen are.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand how hard it is to do what we do, being as big as we are,\u201d said Patrick Matan, a 6-4, 296-pound tackle for Gonzaga. \u201cPeople just see big guys and we eat a lot of food, and they think that maybe that\u2019s all it takes to be an offensive lineman. But it\u2019s more than being big. You have to be athletic, you have to be able to move, you have to be smart.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe position has changed in recent years, given the proliferation of pass-heavy spread offenses, and there has been an increase in specialized training options, including Functional Athletic Training in Maryland\u2019s Montgomery County. Owner and trainer Mike Dillon aims to help aspiring linemen by improving their skills while also developing confidence in their size.\n\n\u201cWe say confidence comes through repetition and an understanding of what you\u2019re doing,\u201d said Dillon, whose company\u2019s Twitter handle is @FATboysOLine.\n\nTengwall said used to be the kid in his middle school locker room who was afraid to take off his shirt around other boys. Now he\u2019s proud of the 300 pounds he carries, which he maintains by eating as many as six meals per day while trying to become as lean as possible before college. That\u2019s the best example he can set right now, he said, but he dreams of having a bigger platform and possibly a slogan to help other linemen with how they view their bodies.\n\n\u201cJust to drive home the fact,\u201d Tengwall said, \u201cthat offensive linemen are not supposed to be fat.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Some players gain 100 or more pounds over the course of their careers.", "authors": ["Roman Stubbs", "Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/HgQYrxuVBqDc6mCtVkK2jMhk7wo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IHUXBVW6JMI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
