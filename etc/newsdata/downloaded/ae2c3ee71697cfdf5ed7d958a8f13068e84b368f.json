How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. Unfortunately, it's common for investors to be enticed in by the seemingly attractive yield, and lose money when the company has to cut its dividend payments.\n\nWith a nine-year payment history and a 5.4% yield, many investors probably find Wynn Macau intriguing. It sure looks interesting on these metrics - but there's always more to the story . There are a few simple ways to reduce the risks of buying Wynn Macau for its dividend, and we'll go through these below.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nSEHK:1128 Historical Dividend Yield, October 24th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. In the last year, Wynn Macau paid out 77% of its profit as dividends. It's paying out most of its earnings, which limits the amount that can be reinvested in the business. This may indicate limited need for further capital within the business, or highlight a commitment to paying a dividend.\n\nAnother important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. Wynn Macau's cash payout ratio in the last year was 43%, which suggests dividends were well covered by cash generated by the business. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.\n\nIs Wynn Macau's Balance Sheet Risky?\n\nAs Wynn Macau has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A rough way to check this is with these two simple ratios: a) net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and b) net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA is a measure of a company's total debt. Net interest cover measures the ability to meet interest payments. Essentially we check that a) the company does not have too much debt, and b) that it can afford to pay the interest. Wynn Macau has net debt of 2.25 times its EBITDA. Using debt can accelerate business growth, but also increases the risks.\n\nWe calculated its interest cover by measuring its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), and dividing this by the company's net interest expense. Wynn Macau has EBIT of 5.33 times its interest expense, which we think is adequate.\n\nWe update our data on Wynn Macau every 24 hours, so you can always get our latest analysis of its financial health, here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. The first recorded dividend for Wynn Macau, in the last decade, was nine years ago. Although it has been paying a dividend for several years now, the dividend has been cut at least once by more than 20%, and we're cautious about the consistency of its dividend across a full economic cycle. During the past nine-year period, the first annual payment was HK$1.94 in 2010, compared to HK$0.90 last year. This works out to be a decline of approximately 8.2% per year over that time. Wynn Macau's dividend has been cut sharply at least once, so it hasn't fallen by 8.2% every year, but this is a decent approximation of the long term change.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Is Wynn Macau, Limited (HKG:1128) a good dividend stock?
