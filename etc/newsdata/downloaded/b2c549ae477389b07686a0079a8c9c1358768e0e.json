Protestors sang the Star Spangled Banner and even had signs asking President Donald Trump to liberate the city, which is under Chinese rule, as they marched towards the United States' consulate.\n\n\u201cFight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong,\u201d they shouted before handing over petitions at the U.S. Consulate, Reuters reported. \u201cResist Beijing, liberate Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThe goal of the protest was to urge members of the United States Congress to support the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. If passed, Congress would reevaluate trade and business privileges for Hong Kong and China on a yearly basis. If officials in Hong Kong and China were suppressing Hongkongers' freedoms, the United States could punish them on the trade front, the New York Times reported.\n\n\"We share the same U.S. values of liberty and democracy,\" 30-year-old banker David Wong told CNN. \"USA is a country of democracy. Donald Trump is elected by his people. We want this.\"\n\nThe protests were initially peaceful but turned violent when protestors blocked a subway entrance and then set it on fire in the Central District, which houses high-end shopping brands, banks and jewelry stores, the New York Post reported. Police had to use tear gas to break up demonstrators.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has said he believes China needs to \"humanely\" settle their disagreements with Hong Kong before the United States and China reach a trade deal.\n\nAlthough Hong Kong and China are considered one country, they have two systems of government. Hongkongers have more freedoms than those on the mainland. Protestors, however, feel that leaders in Beijing are trampling those rights.\n\nHere's a look at the protests:\n\nHong Kong police are psychotic. pic.twitter.com/6RLYXOfH0o \u2014 Ian Miles Cheong (@stillgray) September 8, 2019\n\nThugs in #HongKong set fires on roads and at least one exit of the MTR Central station on Sunday, disrupting traffic and causing chaos in the busy central district.
