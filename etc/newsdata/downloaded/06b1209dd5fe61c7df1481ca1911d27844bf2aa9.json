Of these cases, 35% relate to fraud and corruption, and 15% to drug-related matters.\n\nIn answer to another question, this one by DA MP James Selfe, Lamola explained why the Special Investigating Unit's special tribunal to fast-track the recovery of misappropriated state funds was not yet up and running.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa announced the establishment of the unit in March and, since then, his department had busied itself with creating the administrative structures for the unit, Lamola said.\n\nHe said the drafting of regulations for the unit became a more protracted and tedious process than initially anticipated. The department had the sought assistance of Senior Counsel to ensure that the regulations and rules of procedure were \"watertight and in order to avoid legal technicalities and loopholes that exposed previous Special Tribunals to litigation\".\n\n\"Our previous experience has shown that persons who have stolen and syphoned public funds through corruption and maladministration would not hesitate against the tribunal in order to frustrate its processes and efforts to recover their ill-gotten gains,\" Lamola said.\n\nTherefore, Lamola said, they had to put extra effort and energy into the drafting of the regulations.\n\nHe said the tribunal would become operational as soon as the regulations were published in the Government Gazette.", "description": "The NPA's Asset Forfeiture Unit recovered R115.9m in terms of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act during June and July this year, Justice Minister Ronald Lamola says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9118/5235633636d947128c6dc5da3fcce1ac.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
