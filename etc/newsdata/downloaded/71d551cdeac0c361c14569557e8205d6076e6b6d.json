He can pass, he can run and he can even keep an eye on the refs.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nMahomes showed off that last skill during a 25-yard scramble during Sunday\u2019s game against the Detroit Lions. With a little over two minutes left in the first quarter, Mahomes decided to take off. Before he committed to the run, however, he made sure the ref wasn\u2019t going to throw a flag.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nPatrick Mahomes looking back at the ref for a flag in the middle of the play \ud83e\udd23#KCvsDET pic.twitter.com/9l7PNGaURC \u2014 FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) September 29, 2019\n\nIt looked ... a little bizarre. Mahomes knew there was no Lions player that far behind him, so he must have been looking at the ref. It\u2019s possible Mahomes feared the ref would throw a holding flag, and wanted to check on that before he ran 25 yards down the field.\n\nNo flag was thrown on the play, allowing Mahomes to pick up a nice gain on the ground. That paid off later on the drive, as the Chiefs kicked a field goal.\n\nSince the start of last season, Mahomes has arguably been the best quarterback in football. He might not be a seasoned veteran like Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers, but Mahomes is already getting calls in his favor. He doesn\u2019t even need to talk to the refs to convince them. Mahomes can just stare at them.\n\nPatrick Mahomes is only running 25 yards if he knows the play will count.
