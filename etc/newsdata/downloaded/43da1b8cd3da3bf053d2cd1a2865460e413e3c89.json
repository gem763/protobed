In texts with two other diplomats, Taylor said it was \u201ccrazy\u201d that military aid to Kiev was being blocked in order to force \u201chelp with a political campaign.\u201d Nearly $400 million in military assistance to Ukraine was put on hold in late July by the White House but was released in September two weeks after POLITICO revealed that it was frozen. Taylor described the hold on aid as a \"nightmare\" and said it had already shaken Ukraine's faith in the United States.\n\n\"The Russians love it. (And I quit.),\" Taylor said of the prospect that the aid would be blocked even after Ukraine agreed to open Trump's preferred investigations.\n\nTrump, who urged Zelensky to investigate Biden in a July 25 phone call, has denied the charge that military assistance was used as leverage to bend Zelensky to his will. But the episode is at the heart of Democrats\u2019 deepening impeachment investigation over whether Trump abused his power by leveraging America\u2019s diplomatic and military might to benefit his 2020 reelection campaign.\n\nFormer U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified to lawmakers earlier this month that her removal was the result of a smear campaign engineered by Trump allies. | Mikhail Palinchak, Presidential Press Service Pool Photo via AP\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee, which is leading the inquiry, issued a subpoena to Taylor early Tuesday morning, according to an official, because the State Department tried to block Taylor from appearing. The official also cited \u201cefforts by the State Department to also limit any testimony that does occur,\u201d adding that Taylor was complying with the subpoena.\n\nOther State Department officials have spoken with investigators under subpoena after the State Department and White House sought to block them from appearing \u2014 a sign that the White House\u2019s stranglehold on testimony has begun to slip.\n\nTaylor\u2019s lengthy diplomatic service occurred under Republican and Democratic presidents. He served as ambassador to Ukraine under George W. Bush and Barack Obama from 2006 to 2009. Before that, he held numerous diplomatic posts in the Middle East, advised the U.S. ambassador to NATO and worked on Capitol Hill for former Sen. Bill Bradley. He graduated from West Point and served in Vietnam.\n\nTaylor had left government service for a senior position at the U.S. Institute of Peace but returned to the diplomatic corps in June after Yovanovitch\u2019s ouster. She testified to lawmakers earlier this month that her removal was the result of a smear campaign engineered by Trump allies who portrayed her as disloyal for rebuffing Giuliani\u2019s mission in Ukraine.\n\nTaylor\u2019s two correspondents in the text exchanges \u2014 former ambassador Kurt Volker and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union \u2014 have already testified to impeachment investigators. They painted a portrait of a foreign policy that had been outsourced by Trump to his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Both described deep discomfort with the arrangement and worried that Giuliani\u2019s freelancing \u2014 especially in a country fending off Russian aggression and battling systemic internal corruption \u2014 could undermine America\u2019s years-long diplomatic efforts.\n\nTaylor voiced those concerns in a July text exchange days before Trump called Zelensky, who was elected in the spring on a platform of fighting corruption.\n\n\u201cGordon, one thing Kurt and I talked about yesterday was Sasha Danyliuk\u2019s point that President Zelenskyy is sensitive about Ukraine being taken seriously, not merely as an instrument in Washington domestic, reelection politics,\u201d he said. Danyliuk is likely a reference to Oleksandr Danyliuk, Ukraine\u2019s former finance minister.\n\nSondland replied, \u201cAbsolutely, but we need to get the conversation started and the relationship built, irrespective of the pretext. I am worried about the alternative.\u201d\n\nAfter Trump canceled a late August trip to Poland, where he was to meet Zelensky, the ambassadors again fretted about building a relationship between Trump and Zelensky. Volker said he hoped Vice President Mike Pence would attend in Trump\u2019s place and set up a White House visit for Zelensky. He also said he hoped Energy Secretary Rick Perry would join.\n\nBut Taylor, on Sept. 1, worried that the White House visit itself would be conditioned on Trump\u2019s demand for Ukraine to investigate Biden as well as an unfounded conspiracy theory that Ukraine \u2014 not Russia \u2014 interfered in the 2016 election.\n\nAs Taylor\u2019s concerns about a quid pro quo grew more explicit, Sondland sought to put him at ease.\n\n\u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind,\u201d Sondland texted on Sept. 9, urging his colleagues to stop the text message exchanges.\n\nLast week, Sondland told House investigators that he sent this message after speaking directly to Trump and that he could not speak to whether it was true.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/9e/ad/e126a802493c8a81b651ba7addb0/191022-william-taylor-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
