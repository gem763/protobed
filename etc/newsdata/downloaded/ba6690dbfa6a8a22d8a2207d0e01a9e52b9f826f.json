The side that hits hardest for longest \u2013 with and without the ball \u2013 will ultimately prevail.\n\nBen Ryan England are genuine contenders but I can\u2019t see past the All Blacks, although Beauden Barrett needs to avoid the Kiwi World Cup fly-half curse. In a parallel universe, Mosese Rauluni and Nicky Little return after a 12-year hiatus at half-back for Fiji and they edge a formidable Namibia in the final.\n\nNick Evans Despite injuries, the form of some senior players and a belief from everyone outside New Zealand that they are in decline, the All Blacks are still in the box seat to three-peat the World Cup.\n\nAndy Bull Given the form, the smart answer is South Africa, so my head\u2019s annoyed with my heart for persuading me to commit to this in print but I just wonder if Wales may pull it off.\n\nGerard Meagher New Zealand. I have a feeling they may lose to South Africa on the tournament\u2019s first Saturday but end up exacting revenge back in Yokohoma 42 days later.\n\nPaul Rees New Zealand, ahead of England and South Africa. With the ball-in-play time expected to be high and humidity a factor, they are supremely fit opportunists, menacing when questioned.\n\nClaire Tolley New Zealand on paper, just about, simply because they are best equipped to do so. But, frankly, picking a winner is like trying to pin a tail on a moving donkey.\n\nWho are the dark horses?\n\nRK Wales. The rugby fates were cruel in 2011 when they could have made the final. Anyone writing off Warren Gatland and his durable players before a knockout showdown against England is ignoring their World Cup history.\n\nHumidity to home heroics: five things to look out for at the Rugby World Cup | Ben Ryan Read more\n\nBR Japan. At home. On form. Better than their 2015 side. Beware, Ireland and Scotland.\n\nNE Although Australia traditionally remain a big side they have been widely written off but the Wallabies have a habit of turning up at World Cups. Three performances like the one in Perth against New Zealand could see them lift the cup.\n\nAB After the four years they\u2019ve had, Australia are well back in the betting. Michael Cheika is an expert at pulling a team together over the course of a tournament.\n\nGM France have such firepower among their backs and raw power up front that stringing a run to at least the semi-finals is not inconceivable. Fabien Galthi\u00e9 appears to be making a positive impact too.\n\nPR Wales, who are often judged on style rather than substance, and Scotland, whose counterattacking game should suit the conditions, although rain is forecast ahead of their opener against Ireland.\n\nCT When there\u2019s no favourite and a tightly bunched set of rivals is anyone a dark horse? Wales, possibly, if a team that were world No 1 a few weeks ago can be called that.\n\nWho will be the star player?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fiji\u2019s Semi Radradra celebrates after scoring a try against France last year. Photograph: Christophe Ena/AP\n\nRK Semi Radradra. Do not be surprised if Fiji give Australia a scare on the opening weekend. Either way, the powerful Radradra has all the tools to be the most lethal midfield ball-carrier in the tournament.\n\nBR Three Fijian back-rowers \u2013 Peceli Yato, Semi Kunatani & Bill Mata.\n\nNE Damian Penaud from France is a quality wing who has pace, power and a slipperiness about him. Expect him to score a lot of tries.\n\nAB Springbok wing Cheslin Kolbe, short, squat, but whip-smart and sharp, with the best step in the game, a welcome reminder that even today size isn\u2019t everything.\n\nGM Handr\u00e9 Pollard. The Springbok fly-half has everything in his armoury the complete modern-day No 10 would want. South Africa are well fancied for the tournament but not if Pollard, who has played 42 times for his country, goes down early.\n\nPR Injuries and red cards are likely to be factors but Beauden Barrett if New Zealand are to win. Maro Itoje, Makazole Mapimpi and James Ryan to polish their reputations.\n\nCT High hopes of someone such as Fiji\u2019s Semi Radradra stunning everyone, while given the pool lineup, think heaps of visibility will go to the All Blacks\u2019 Sevu Reece or the Springbok back-row Pieter-Steph du Toit.\n\nWho will be the biggest flop?\n\nRK New Zealand? Just kidding, but there is bound to be a grim-faced inquest should they miss out on a third straight World Cup title. This is not, relatively speaking, a vintage All Black pack and their opponents are improving.\n\nBR I hate to say it but Ireland. Can\u2019t see them going past the quarters.\n\nNE Hard one this. One of either Ireland or Scotland if Japan end up getting out of the pool, or Argentina. Take your pick.\n\nAB Apart from all of us making these predictions? For all their talented young players, France have the air of a side who may blow up spectacularly in the group stages.\n\nGM Canada have made the quarter-finals once, in 1991, so it may be harsh to suggest they will flop but they are at their lowest ebb and squeezed through by beating Hong Kong. They are in the same pool as New Zealand and South Africa and we could see a record points margin.\n\nPR France, if they look to 2023 as hosts rather than now, or Australia, who, for all their victory over New Zealand in the summer, have been brittle since the 2015 final.\n\nCT Not who, but what. A proper tier\u2011two challenge, sadly. Happy to have egg on my face after a few days but I can\u2019t quite see anyone reaching the knockout stages.\n\nHow far will the home nations go?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Wales\u2019 captain, Alun Wyn Jones, leads a training session in Kitakyushu. Photograph: Christophe Simon/AFP/Getty Images\n\nRK At least two should reach the semis, injuries and typhoons permitting. Given Ireland, Wales and England are all guided by Kiwi or Australian head coaches, however, the old north-south battle lines are blurred these days.\n\nBR I think England could very well play Wales in the quarters so only one home nation to go through to semis. Others to fall before that.\n\nNE England to lose to New Zealand in the semi-finals, Wales to make it to the last four as well, Ireland and Scotland to fall one hurdle earlier in the last eight.\n\nAB Further than they did in 2015, for sure. England and Wales should both make the semi-finals, beyond that it all feels too close to call.\n\nGM England to reach the semis before familiar failings return, Wales and Ireland to go out in the quarter-finals and Scotland to go out in the pool stages, going down in a decider against Japan.\n\nPR At least three in the quarter-finals, probably four; two in the semis.\n\nCT One or two to reach the semi-finals depending on whether England or Wales play each other. Not sure mentally if they can get past that hurdle to the final.\n\nWho will surprise us?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Japan will be looking to build on their stunning victory against South Africa at the 2015 Rugby World Cup. Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters\n\nRK Aside from Fiji, the hosts, Japan, will be more awkward opponents than many expect. France are bound to have at least one irresistible half of rugby in them and, off the field, cosy European assumptions will be tested on an hourly basis.\n\nBR Possibly a typhoon. Under RWC regulations if a group game has to be cancelled it\u2019s deemed a 0-0 draw. Spanner. Works.\n\nNE I\u2019m looking forward to seeing Fiji play in the warm conditions of Japan. They are a very dangerous team who could scare Wales and Australia.\n\nAB Japan, even though we\u2019ve all been forewarned by that match against the Springboks four years ago. The big beasts in their group, Ireland and Scotland, look a little vulnerable.\n\nGM It would be a pleasant surprise if World Rugby shows transparency over controversial decisions and does so as a priority, with coaches also displaying restraint, but that feels like wishful thinking.\n\nPR Japan will dream and it could come down to their final group match against Scotland. Fiji will be a handful for Australia and Wales having worked on their discipline.\n\nCT France. Which is probably a surprise to read for a start but they\u2019ve been in camp for months unlike during other tournaments, so they will be better than we think. I still think they may pip Argentina in their opening match.\n\nI can\u2019t wait for ...\n\nRK The invitation from Eddie Jones to share a few relaxed beers and join his squad for a spot of karaoke. If the top teams spend the first Asian-hosted Rugby World Cup entirely cocooned in their hotel rooms the whole sport will have missed a massive trick.\n\nBR Upsets. The game needs a bigger top table and maybe, just maybe, RWC 2019 is going to finally see that. We live in hope.\n\nNE I\u2019m not exactly waiting for it but I have a feeling with the tackle and ruck laws as they are, a red card could have a massive bearing in a big game for a big team. Keep everything crossed it isn\u2019t your team.\n\nAB Japan v Russia, the very first game. Despite everything you\u2019ve just read I\u2019ve absolutely no idea what\u2019s going to unfold in the next seven weeks, no one does.

If there is always a touch of inevitability about the pool stages \u2013 give or take the odd shock \u2013 this year there is likely to be a genuine case for all quarter-finalists going on and winning the final.\n\nPR A referee to crack down on encroachment behind.
