Great I can start watching it again\", while another wrote: \"No debate! You're fired!\"\n\nBut others actually admitted that the show isn't worth watching without Piers.\n\n\"Without you there\u2019s no GMB,\" one confessed.\n\nAnd in response to his Piers' tweet another said: \"Never, you make breakfast tv worth watching.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nIt comes after he slammed the petition calling for him to be sacked from GMB after saying he identified as a penguin.\n\nHe made the claim as a reaction to a BBC film that says there are more than 100 genders.\n\nIn a tweet publicising the online petition, his view was called \"dangerous and dehumanising\".\n\nIn response Piers tweeted: \"You can't remove me, I'm currently identifying as a penguin so it would be animal cruelty.\"\n\nPiers is set to talk about his contract tomorrow morning.\n\n*Good Morning Britain airs from 6am on weekdays on ITV", "description": "The GMB controversial host could say goodbye to his spot on the panel on December 31", "authors": ["Brogan-Leigh Hurst", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20569187.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-13-at-003202.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
