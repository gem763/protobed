But the Democratic presidential candidate doesn\u2019t think that merely taxing lobbyists will have much of an impact, proposing a deeper attack on the foundation of the lobbying industry.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nAgainst the backdrop of Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s, D-Mass., proposal this week to tax lobbyists as much as 75 percent, Yang agreed with his fellow Democratic presidential candidate about the need to curtail money\u2019s impact throughout the political system. He said, however, that Warren\u2019s proposal doesn\u2019t go far enough.\n\nVia his social media channels on Thursday morning, Yang said more needs to be done than simply slapping the wrist of lobbyists with a tax. Of Warren's proposal, Yang tweeted that, given the exponential return lobbyists receive for their money, that Warren's plan of \"a tax of 35-75% will do next to nothing.\"\n\n\u201cA mild tax would just make lobbying slightly more expensive,\u201d Yang tweeted. \u201cYou would either need to make the tax greater than 100,000% - or 1,000x - or prohibit lobbying entirely. Or you could flood the system with people-powered money and tie legislators to the public.\u201d\n\nYang continued, suggesting that citizens be given $100 annually to contribute to political campaigns of their choosing. He called the American voter \u201cour most powerful lobbyists.\u201d\n\nTerm limits was another issue in Yang\u2019s scope on Thursday, noting that special interests could and should be limited through term limits.\n\n\u201cOne way to free up legislators from corporate interests is term limits. Right now legislators spend decades in DC trying to stay in power,\u201d Yang said in one of his tweets. \u201cWith term limits you would be free to vote on behalf of your constituents because you are returning home soon anyway.\u201d\n\nThe United States Chamber of Commerce spends the most on political lobbying, having invested $94 million in 2018. The National Association of Realtors ($72.8 million) and the Open Society Policy Center ($31.5 million) round out the top three lobbyists for last year.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Andrew Yang favors taxing lobbyists, but said the current proposal from his fellow Democratic presidential candidates doesn't go far enough.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/07/0/0/andrew-yang-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
