There have been deaths and there have been a lot of other problems. People think it\u2019s an easy solution to cigarettes, but turns out that it has its own difficulties,\u201d said President Trump. \u201cNot only is it a problem overall \u2014 but really specifically with respect to children.\u201d\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and acting FDA commissioner Norman Sharpless were in the Oval Office as Trump told reporters about the decision.\n\nAzar said the FDA plans to finalize guidance to take all non-tobacco flavored vaping products off the market. He said the ban will include mint and menthol flavors.\n\nTobacco flavored products will still be available for adults, who are trying to quit smoking traditional cigarettes, according to Azar. He noted if the FDA sees children are still being attracted to e-cigarettes or if e-cigarettes are being marketed to children, the FDA could take further action.\n\nE-Cigarette vaporizer components are displayed at Smoke and Gift Shop on June 25, 2019 in San Francisco, California.

Azar said 8 million adults and 5 million children use e-cigarettes.\n\n\u201cAn entire generation of children risks become addicted to nicotine because of the attractiveness, appealability and availability of these vaping products,\u201d said Azar.\n\nTrump said he hopes the announcement will raise awareness about the potential dangers of e-cigarettes.\n\n\u201cParents are going to be a lot tougher with respect to their children. A lot of people think vaping is wonderful,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s really not a wonderful thing. It\u2019s got big problems. We have to find out the extent of the problem. It\u2019s so new.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, vape giant Juul came under fire from the FDA over its marketing practices. The FDA slammed Juul for claiming its products were safer than cigarettes.\n\n\"We strongly agree with the need for aggressive category-wide action on flavored products. We will fully comply with the final FDA policy when effective,\u201d said a Juul spokesperson in a statement to Yahoo Finance, in response to the proposed ban.\n\n\n\nRepublican and Democratic lawmakers have urged the administration to take action to curb what federal health officials have called an \u201cepidemic.\u201d\n\n\u201cVaping targets kids, and these flavors\u2014mint, menthol, gummy bear, Unicorn Milk, lung candy\u2014have been essential to the industry luring children into this new addiction. I will closely review FDA\u2019s guidance. Finally, the FDA is doing its job,\u201d said Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nAzar said it could take the FDA several weeks to finalize the guidance.\n\nJessica Smith is a reporter for Yahoo Finance based in Washington, D.C.
