Show us it wasn't the 5 Republican appointees who took that abortion case.\n\nOct. 1 may have begun as any other day at the U.S. Supreme Court, but it ended with a death knell to impartiality. Befitting the most powerful, least accountable institution in Washington, the action took place behind closed doors.\n\nAt some point that day, as we learned in an order issued later in the week, four or more justices voted to hear a case that will test the legality of a Louisiana law requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at local hospitals. This law is nearly identical to the one from Texas that the court struck down in 2016. Yet instead of all nine justices following court precedent and telling the Bayou State, via summary judgment, to take a hike, some subset of the nine thought it prudent to make this highly charged issue the linchpin of the 2019-20 court term.\n\nNot a high court the public can trust\n\nFive or more votes determine the ruling at the court, but for a petition to be granted review, only four justices\u2019 votes are needed. Like so much else hidden from view at the Supreme Court, the public never knows which four have voted for review \u2014 that is, until a case like this comes along and the votes become easily surmised.\n\nFor run-of-the-mill petitions, there is a combination of strategy and courtesy that goes into a justice\u2019s vote to grant review. But in a petition as highly charged as the Louisiana one, a group of four justices would not risk bringing it to argument if they were not confident in the outcome.\n\nAt the Supreme Court in 2018.

Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, whose anti-abortion views are clear, have been added to the bench since then. The \u201cRule of Four\u201d has become the \"Sure Thing of Five.\"\n\nThe notice to grant review can then be seen in the larger context of today\u2019s Supreme Court: Major cases are almost always decided by the slimmest of margins and often feature legal reasoning based not on history and precedent but on how to achieve a particular outcome. Cases that determined the winner of a presidential election, who may obtain health care, who can vote or whom we can marry easily fall into this category.\n\nThis is not a court that an increasingly skeptical public can trust.\n\nLGBTQ job bias: My partner was fired for being gay. The Supreme Court can't set a pro-bigotry precedent.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t go about our work in a political manner,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts told a Manhattan audience last month. OK. Prove it. Tell us which justices among you are voting to grant review in the major cases the court is taking.\n\nShow us that all nine justices, or maybe three conservatives and three liberals, voted to grant the travel ban case (decided 5-4), the gerrymandering case (decided 5-4) or the public unions case (decided 5-4).\n\nIf choices aren't partisan, prove it\n\nProve to the public that it was not the five Republican-appointed justices who voted to grant the Louisiana abortion petitions. Give us the vote tally on the same page on which the orders are noted.\n\nEditorial Board: Court blows it on gerrymandering. What an incumbent racket.\n\nIf the Supreme Court\u2019s work is truly done apolitically, we would see Republican-appointed justices voting for grants with Democratic-appointed justices just as often as with their Republican-appointed colleagues. Or we\u2019d see a raft of a nine-vote grants, as the justices stood in solidarity with one another to belie their partisan inclinations. Even that is better than the current system.\n\nBut after two decades of polarization came to a head this month with an obvious, politically minded grant, the chief justice can no longer spout the institutional line and tell us with a straight face that he and his colleagues are beholden to no political ideology.\n\nWe\u2019d like to believe that the third branch hasn\u2019t been impacted by the hyperpartisanship of today. But we\u2019re not naive. If we\u2019re wrong, show us. Don\u2019t just tell.\n\nGabe Roth is executive director of Fix the Court, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for greater transparency in the federal judiciary.
