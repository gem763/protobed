She also alleged that he did the same to another woman at the same event.\n\nDowning Street initially declined to comment on Sunday; but after senior ministers were peppered with questions about the alleged incident, a No 10 spokesperson said: \u201cThe allegation is untrue.\u201d\n\nSources said the quote related specifically to the allegation that Johnson put his hand on Edwardes\u2019 knee.\n\nThe prime minister is said to be furious at the claim, which Downing Street insiders privately described as \u201cbollocks\u201d and \u201cnonsense\u201d.\n\nEdwardes tweeted on Sunday night: \u201cIf the prime minister doesn\u2019t recollect the incident then clearly I have a better memory than he does.\u201d\n\nToday at the Conservative party conference Read more\n\nMatt Hancock, the health secretary, who ran against Johnson for his party\u2019s leadership, was initially criticised for suggesting the issue related to Johnson\u2019s private life. Johnson \u201cnever lectured people about their private lives,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, Hancock later told Channel 4 News of Edwardes: \u201cI know her and I know her to be trustworthy.\u201d\n\nAmber Rudd later tweeted: \u201cI agree with @MattHancock\u201d.\n\nJohnson had hoped to use this week\u2019s conference in Manchester to drive home his \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d slogan, and to highlight a series of domestic policy announcements, including on the NHS, law and order and schools.\n\nBut he has been dogged by allegations about his personal conduct since he launched his Tory leadership campaign earlier this year.\n\nThe Guardian revealed in June that police had been called to a loud altercation at the London flat he shared with his partner Carrie Symonds. She has accompanied him to the party conference in Manchester.\n\nTory MP Rachel Maclean, who also works for the Conservative Women in Parliament Group, said she was proud to work under a feminist prime minister.\n\nShe said: \u201cI am a feminist. I am proud to say that and I\u2019m proud to be part of a government that is led by a feminist.\u201d\n\nFormer defence secretary Penny Mordaunt said Johnson \u201chas the style of Frank Spencer in a china shop but he is a decent person and I think he cares a great deal about women and girls\u201d.\n\nAsked whether Johnson had questions to answer over the allegations, Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary and former women\u2019s minister, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not something I know anything about. I\u2019m sure members of the press will put their questions directly to the prime minister.\u201d\n\nLiz Truss, the international trade secretary, who is also responsible for women and equalities on behalf of the government, said at a fringe meeting that she was not familiar with the Sunday Times report.\n\nShe added: \u201cI will need to look at that in more detail.\u201d\n\nHowever, some Conservative activists expressed concerns. One announced she had quit the Conservative party over Johnson\u2019s attitudes towards women, and criticised other women in the party for defending him.\n\nAceil Haddad, a PR consultant who has run as a Tory councillor and Greater London Authority member, said: \u201cYou only need to look at the Sunday Times to see what is being accepted, and the reason why I left is I can\u2019t stand as a Conservative and say I can see the greater good because that means I\u2019m allowing it to happen.\u201d\n\nAddressing party activists, she said: \u201cI want you to do something. Say this is not acceptable.\u201d\n\nShe said: \u201cPolitics and the act of law making has been boiled down to willy-waving, theatrics and \u2018he said-he said\u2019.\u201d\n\nAsked how Tory women could defend the prime minister, Haddad told the Guardian: \u201cLook at his attitude towards women \u2026 Unfortunately we have got women who are scripted. They don\u2019t feel like they can say anything.\u201d\n\nLast week, Johnson was criticised for being insensitive and using inflammatory language after a string of clashes with female Labour MPs.\n\nLabour MP Dawn Butler, the shadow women and equalities secretary, has written to Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, and James Cleverly, the chair of the Conservative party, calling for an \u201curgent and thorough\u201d investigation into the \u201cserious allegations of misconduct\u201d in the Sunday Times.\n\nButler writes in her letter that this is the \u201clatest in a number of serious charges of abuse of power\u201d made against Johnson, which includes allegations of conflicts of public interest and misuse of public funds after failing to declare an interest in the allocation of public money to Arcuri.\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said: \u201cBoris Johnson probably doesn\u2019t even remember this incident, because to men like him it won\u2019t even register as sexual harassment and an abuse of power.\n\n\u201cThe power and privilege that has surrounded Boris Johnson his entire life means he has avoided facing the consequences of his actions.\u201d", "description": "Charlotte Edwardes alleges the then Spectator editor touched her leg \u2018high up\u2019 at 1999 lunch", "authors": ["Kate Proctor", "Heather Stewart"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7cc494c102a779f4689a44937b85e70c747ffa5/0_53_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f3ffabac7d00b8b1c021cc54224020f6", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
