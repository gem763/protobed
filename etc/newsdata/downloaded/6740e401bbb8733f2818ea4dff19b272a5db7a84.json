Camping is often more satisfying as a memory than it is when you\u2019re actually doing it. In reality, camping often includes tents that won\u2019t stay up, campfires that won\u2019t light, and necessary cooking supplies left behind. But remember how excellent everything smelled? A number of fragrance brands have bottled that part of the experience. Summer might be over, but whether you managed to sleep under the stars or not, the scents below will keep its good memories alive \u2014 minus the DEET and the unidentified midnight rustling outside your tent.\n\nThe One That Smells Like a Walk in the Woods\n\nAftelier Fir Solid Perfume Perfumer Mandy Aftel harnessed a number of fir notes in this beeswax and jojoba oil\u2013based solid. I rub some of it on my wrists whenever I\u2019m stressed and it transports me to a damp, mossy path surrounded by pine trees that soar to the sky. $250 at Aftelier Buy\n\nThe One That Smells Like the Desert\n\nD.S. & Durga Cowboy Grass Eau de Parfum If your ideal camping trip is more Grand Canyon than Green Mountains, this rosewood, sagebrush, vetiver, and grass mix offers a mildly cowboy appeal without having to get in the saddle. $175 at Amazon Buy $175 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe One That Smells Like Someone Is Getting High in the Dunes\n\nHeretic Parfum Dirty Grass Some fans say they smell pot when they inhale this scent, which would be thanks to the hemp note. I mostly smell its other dominant note: vetiver, which contributes to the smoky, beachy vibe. $85 at Heretic Parfum Buy\n\nThe One That Evokes Riverbanks Upstate\n\nBurkelman T.H.V.F (That Hudson Valley Fragrance) This Cold Spring, New York\u2013based boutique first dipped into scent creation with candles a few years ago but liquefied them into wearable versions this fall. The blend of moss, tobacco leaves, and fire is missing one descriptor, IMHO, and that\u2019s \u201cbreezy.\u201d Something about it brings to mind a wide-open-spaces element, even though moss is usually found in shaded areas. $112 at Burkelman Buy\n\nThe One That Smells Like Wearing a Biker Jacket on a Hike\n\nMaison Margiela Replica Fantasies: Soul of the Forest Perfume Upon first spritz, a very earthy, mossy balsam moment lands on your skin. Once it dries down, though, patchouli, incense, and atlas cedar take over and leave a seriously leathery element that sticks around. $250 at Amazon Buy $250 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe One That Smells Like a Glacier\n\nAndrea Maack Birch Perfume Icelandic artist and perfume creator Andrea Maack says her warm, woodsy scent evokes \u201ca family cabin hidden away in the Arctic tundra.\u201d Okay, technically, that isn\u2019t camping, but this blend of guaiac, cypriol, patchouli, and musk perfectly captures that last-embers-of-the-fire feel, which is the same whether it emanates from a fireplace in an Arctic cabin or a bonfire in a makeshift circle of rocks at a state park somewhere in the Catskills. $98 at Andrea Maack Buy\n\nThe One That Smells Like Camping in the Jungle\n\nR\u00e9gime des Fleurs Falls Eau de Parfum Imagine setting up camp near a stories-high waterfall somewhere in the rain forest and being lulled to sleep by its rushing, hypnotic sound and the verdant mist rising from it. Or if this feels a little unlikely, imagine dabbing some of this jungle-moss-scented fragrance on your body, then getting on the subway. Ahhh. $125 at R\u00e9gime des Fleurs Buy\n\nThe One That Smells Like Barbecue\n\nFueguia Muskara Cuero Perfume You know how a bonfire\u2019s smell can permeate your clothes and hair in seconds? If that grosses you out, you probably won\u2019t dig this fragrance. However, if you wish you could capture that scent in the bonfire-less confines of your home, you need this bottle. Several woods, including birch, oak, and an Argentine wood called quebracho, anchor this blend, whose strong smoky element is inspired by the South American grilling technique of asado. North Americans might detect hints of our own gastronomic delicacy, the Slim Jim. This is not a bad thing. $293 at Fueguia Buy\n\nThe One That Smells Like the Woods at Sunrise\n\nThe Nue Co Functional Fragrance: Stress Cardamom, cilantro, iris, and palo santo are in this scent, which was designed to alleviate stress. I mostly smell the palo santo, which reminds me of early mornings at camp when it\u2019s practically cold even in August. $30 at The Nue Co Buy\n\nThe One With the Most Tree Oils\n\nCult of Treehouse Tree Healer Grounding Perfume Oil This nascent brand makes three products, each of which gives off excellent camping vibes (the face-and-neck serum is even called Campfire Glow). This roll-on is the standout, though. It promises to improve energy flow, dissolve unfriendly electromagnetic vibrations, and raise the good ones, which, okay sure, but it\u2019s also made from the resins of \u2014 count \u2019em \u2014 17 tree oils and smells delicious. $90 at Cult of Treehouse Buy\n\nThe One That Will Make You Feel Like a Forest Maiden\n\nPinrose Treehouse Royal Eau de Parfum Spray Fig lends a slightly sweet elegance to the moss, cassis, jasmine, and vetiver in this scent. I imagine it being something one would wear to a wedding in the forest. Or if Snow White is your idol. $45 at Pinrose Buy\n\nThe One That Smells Like Totoro\u2019s Home\n\nAesop Hwyl Eau de Parfum The Cut\u2019s Kathleen Hou wrote about this scent when it launched two years ago. It aims to transport the wearer into a damp Japanese forest with its blend of smoky vetiver, earthy frankincense, woody cypress, and smooth sandalwood. $135 at Aesop Buy\n\nThe One That Smells More Like You\u2019re in a Nice Country House and the Window Happens to Be Open\n\nRed Flower Ionizing Vita Flower Mist Despite its name, this smells quite woodsy thanks to the oils of grand fir needle and juniper berry. But since it comes in the form of a light mist that\u2019s meant to be sprayed on body and face, it\u2019s not overpowering. $38 at Amazon Buy $38 at Amazon Buy\n\nAnd the One for Indoor Kids\n\nImaginary Authors A City on Fire Despite its urban name, the fourth and final word is what matters most in this fiery scent. Perfumer Josh Meyer created it for a menswear line, but I think it\u2019s sexy on a woman. I\u2019ve been wearing it for years because I love smelling like a fireplace maybe even more than I love smelling like a bonfire. $38 at Imaginary Authors Buy\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.", "description": "Camping might be fraught with peril \u2014 the damp! the bugs! the lack of indoor plumbing! \u2014 but it always smells so good.
