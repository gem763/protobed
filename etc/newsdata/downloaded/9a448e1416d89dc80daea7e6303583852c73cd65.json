Several County Council members who support Jones criticized Elrich (D) on Monday for what they say was poor handling of the process.\n\nAs recently as Aug. 27, Elrich, who took office in December, said he would not consider Jones for the role of permanent chief in the majority-minorty jurisdiction of 1 million. His announcement to the contrary on Monday came after three top contenders dropped out of the running over the past two months.\n\n\u201cThis is a critical nomination that I take very seriously,\u201d Elrich said in a statement. \u201cFor the last five months, we have conducted the most open and inclusive police chief search in the County\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nElrich acknowledged that Jones was not his first choice for the role, which became vacant when Police Chief J. Thomas Manger retired after 15 years. Takoma Park Police Chief Antonio DeVaul, who emerged as one of two finalists in July, dropped out a week later, saying he wanted to stay at the helm of the much smaller Takoma Park department. The other semifinalist, former Portsmouth, Va., police chief Tonya Chapman, pulled her name from consideration in August.\n\nElrich\u2019s next choice was Darryl McSwain, a retired Montgomery County police official who is chief of the Maryland-National Capital Park Police, Montgomery County division. McSwain withdrew his name Monday, praising Jones and writing in a news release that taking the job would have meant giving up some of the retirement benefits he was getting from his earlier time working for the county.\n\nThat left Jones.\n\n\u201cI felt that it was important to look outside the department for new leadership,\u201d Elrich said in his statement. \u201cHowever, Marcus and I have discussed my expectations, and I am confident that he shares my vision and will carry out the changes I want to see.\u201d\n\nJones, who has been with the Montgomery County police for 34 years, has served as the acting police chief since June. He was the early choice of the department\u2019s rank-and-file and has experience in the Silver Spring police district, the narcotics bureau and the major-crimes bureau.\n\nIf confirmed by the County Council, he would be the first insider appointed to the top job since 1995.\n\n\u201cHe rose through the ranks here,\u201d homicide detective Dimitry Ruvin said in July, when The Washington Post reported that Jones had not made an initial list of finalists for the job. \u201cHe knows this police department. He would have been amazing.\u201d\n\nCounty Council member Hans Riemer (D-At Large) said Monday that Jones should have been nominated from the beginning. The nomination process \u201cdragged out,\u201d Riemer said, because Elrich \u201cdidn\u2019t get it right.\u201d\n\n\u201cGuy\u2019s done a great job. What more could he have done to prove his capability? Why wouldn\u2019t you have gone with him?\u201d Riemer said. \u201cCould have saved a lot of time and a lot of grief.\u201d\n\nIn July, a Montgomery officer was charged with assault and misconduct after using his shin to force a man\u2019s head into the ground during an arrest. The incident, which was caught on camera, sparked an outcry among activists and prompted lawmakers to introduce legislation for a Policing Advisory Commission that would examine police behavior.\n\nIn May, an officer was caught on video using a racial slur after approaching a group of African American men who were accused of loitering.\n\nLast year, prosecutors ruled that the fatal shooting of an unarmed man in a chaotic parking lot encounter in Silver Spring was justified.\n\nCouncil members Will Jawando (D-At Large) and Tom Hucker (D-District 5), who have been outspoken about the need for police to interact better with the community, said Monday that they support Jones\u2019s nomination.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been the best process, I\u2019ll admit that,\u201d Jawando said. \u201cA lot of ups and downs, and twists and turns, for a critical position.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout question, everyone agrees it could have gone much more smoothly,\u201d Hucker said.\n\nCouncil President Nancy Navarro (D-District 4) said she appreciates that Jones \u201cknows Montgomery County inside and out,\u201d adding, \u201cIn my opinion, Jones has always been a strong contender for this post.\u201d\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "After incidents, Montgomery County executive says he wants to change the \u2018culture\u2019 of the department.", "authors": ["Rebecca Tan", "Local Reporter"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XUL7LHDPOAI6TEZRGC6FQNXURY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
