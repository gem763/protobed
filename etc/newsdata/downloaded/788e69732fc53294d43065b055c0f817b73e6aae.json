Illustration: Intelligencer. Photo: The MIT Press\n\nOn September 23, the United Nations opened its Climate Action Summit here in New York, three days after the Global Climate Strike, led by Greta Thunberg, swept through thousands of cities worldwide. To mark the occasion, Intelligencer will be publishing \u201cState of the World,\u201d a series of in-depth interviews with climate leaders from Bill Gates to Naomi Klein and Rhiana Gunn-Wright to William Nordhaus interrogating just how they see the precarious climate future of the planet \u2014 and just how hopeful they think we should all be about avoiding catastrophic warming. (Unfortunately, very few are hopeful.)\n\nVaclav Smil cuts an unusual figure in the climate world \u2014 an iconoclastic Czech-Canadian scientist, he is often called the person who understands energy transitions better than anyone else in the world. (Bill Gates is a particular fan.) But his view of energy transitions is, famously, dour \u2014 that it will take, at least, many more decades to produce a transition to renewable energy than most analysts and advocates predict and that a total transition may prove tremendously difficult.\n\nIn his new book, Growth \u2014 a dense, 500-page treatise that covers everything from \u201cmicroorganisms to megacities,\u201d whose afterword we\u2019re excerpting here \u2014 Smil makes perhaps an even-more-off-putting proposition: that in order to \u201censure the habitability of the biosphere,\u201d we must at the very least move away from prioritizing growth and perhaps abandon it entirely.\n\nLet me start by asking you about the very end of the book. I know so much of this was written in a spirit of caution and care and wanting to avoid drawing long-term, large-scale conclusions from the material. But from my read, at least, it ends on a quite definitive note. \u201cThe long-term survival of our civilization cannot be assured without setting limits on the planetary scale.\u201d\n\nThat has been always the case. There\u2019s nothing new in this, except many people have been refusing to recognize it.\n\nCan you tell me a bit about how you came to that conclusion?\n\nSpeaking as an old-fashioned scientist, I think the message is kind of a primitive and, again, old-fashioned message. This is a finite planet. There is a finite amount of energy. There is finite efficiency of converting it by animals and crops. And there are certain sensitivities in terms of biogeochemical cycles, which will tolerate only that much. I mean, that should be obvious to anybody who\u2019s ever taken some kind of kindergarten biology.\n\nUnfortunately, this is a society where nobody\u2019s taking kindergarten biology because everybody\u2019s studying what\u2019s communications, writing in code, economics, business administration, liaising the state office, and things like that. This is a new civilization we have. People are totally detached from reality. If you are attached, at least a bit, to reality, all of this is common sense.\n\nYou\u2019ve said that while economists believe we can decouple growth from material consumption, that is \u201ctotal nonsense.\u201d How much do you think we need to reduce out expectations for economic growth, then?\n\nIf you look at the fundamentals of human existence, the yield of crops, the energy which we save by making materials, the energy we save by making better converters, no matter if it\u2019s turbines, or cars, all these things which run our economy are basically improving at a rate of one, or two, or at best about 3 percent a year. There is no 30 percent or 40 percent gross there, really.\n\nIt\u2019s actually becoming more and more difficult to wring out even those 3 percent, because there are many things here. We are approaching thermal dynamic or straight pneumatic limits with many of these things. This idea of dematerialization, decreasing the energy intensity \u2014 fine, you can keep doing it, but you cannot do it forever. If I built a house, I can make it lighter, but I will still need some steel, some lumber, some tiles, some glass. I cannot make it not using material. This is another kind of false god \u2014 dematerialization and decrease of energy efficiency. Energy efficiency is helpful, it\u2019s happening all the time, but it has its own thermal dynamic and material limits.\n\nEven the progress in transistors, which I think has been the sort of conceptual model that so many optimists are basing their faith in \u2014 even that progress is slowing down considerably.\n\nTechnically speaking, we are nearly at the limit. Everything simply has their limits. That\u2019s the message of this book. Everything has its limits. This is why I\u2019m so irritated by this Kurzweilian nonsense \u2014 just say it aloud, by 2047, human intelligence will be expanding into the universe at the speed of light. Really? And he is the chief scientific adviser to Google.\n\nYeah.\n\nI mean, I\u2019m speechless. As a scientist, I\u2019m speechless. These loonies. These people are flying around the world and preaching the vision of singularity by 2047. It\u2019s like, what\u2019s her name? That Goop lady, what\u2019s her name?\n\nGwyneth Paltrow.\n\nThe actress. This is unbelievable, right? The scientific version of Goop.\n\nOn climate, tell me where you think we\u2019re headed.\n\nThe American way is to have the whole pie and eat it at the same time: we are going to have SUVs everywhere and raspberries from Nicaragua in Europe in January. And transport it by airplane even, and do all these things as we have been doing. In fact, we do even more because now Chinese will copy us.\n\nThink of this Chinese tourism now. Before there would be 100 million Chinese tourists flying every year, only something like 40 million of them are flying.\n\nTo deal with that, we\u2019d need a totally different kind of plane or a massive carbon-sequestration project.\n\nMark my words, there\u2019ll be no massive sequestration of carbon. There hasn\u2019t been any, and there\u2019ll not be any next year, or 2025, or 2030.\n\nWhy are you so sure?\n\nThe scale. We now make about 37 billion tons of carbon dioxide. Ten percent of that is 3.7 billion tons. Say 4 billion tons of C02, just to control 10 percent of the problem. This is almost exactly the amount of crude oil we produce. It took us 100-plus years to develop an industry, which is taking 4 billion tons out of the ground and with the gradient, and then taking it up and refining and using it. Now we would have to develop a new industry, which would take 4 billion tons, and store it, push it against the gradient into the ground, and guarantee that it will stay there forever. Something like this cannot be done in five, or 10, or 15 years. And this is 10 percent. So, simply on the matter of scale, carbon sequestration is just simply dead on arrival.\n\nWhat does that mean for where we\u2019re headed?\n\nWe have to do something else. There\u2019s this hope, this great hope of this technical fix. We\u2019ll have the raspberries, and we\u2019ll have the SUVs, but also the carbon will be dealt with. My favorite choice would be not with strawberries in January, and not with SUVs.\n\nTo draw down on consumption, in other words.\n\nThis is what I call the slack in the system, and most people are not even aware, because they haven\u2019t studied the systems closely enough, what tremendous slack in the system you have. There\u2019s lots of waste before we produce food, but even after we produce it, 40 percent of our harvest is wasted. You cannot eliminate all this, but you could eliminate probably like two-thirds of it easily.\n\nThe same thing goes about buildings. If everybody would have a house like I have, we would be saving like 5, or 7, or 8 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year. We need to take up this enormous slack in the system and bring down our consumption of everything by 10, 20, 30, 40 percent quite realistically. But people aren\u2019t willing to do it, because people want to have it all. Giant houses with circular staircases which are not properly insulated. They want to have their SUVs, and they want to have their raspberries in January. That\u2019s the problem.\n\nSo, you don\u2019t think there\u2019s much hope of us staying below two degrees of warming, for instance?\n\nSorry, say it again?\n\nI assume that means you don\u2019t think there\u2019s much chance of staying below two degrees of warming, for instance.\n\n(A) I wouldn\u2019t be hung up on two degrees. Why not 1.9 or 2.1? From a scientific point of view, two degrees is meaningless. Whatever the goal is there, though, we certainly are well on track to go past that actually. There is no doubt about that.\n\nDo you see any way we change course?\n\nWell, we could. I could design you the global system today without any horrible loss of standard of living all around the world. Consuming 30, 40, 50 percent less of everything what we are consuming. Be it water, or steel, or energy, but we are not willing to go down that route. Technically, it doesn\u2019t require any new inventions, nothing, and it will actually save us money in many ways.\n\nBut the expectations are just crazy, they\u2019re just so crazy. Food waste, for instance, is just amazing. We grow all that stuff, we dump all those fossil fuels, all this liquid used, diesel and gasoline, and electricity, and metals, and ammonia, fertilizers. And we waste 40 percent of everything they grow. Because the expectation is what? That everybody should have strawberries in December, everywhere? No matter if it\u2019s northern Japan or northern Finland, really, right? The expectations are quite ridiculous because we don\u2019t need raspberries or strawberries in December. The amount of vitamin C is as good in any apple which could be stored over winter.\n\nMy favorite example is this creation of SUVs. I love all these people telling me that they have to take these great steps to limit global warming. When if we would have never introduced SUVs in the 1980s. There was no reason to introduce them, nobody was calling for them. We could have saved billions upon billions of cumulative tons of carbon since 1985 by not having SUVs. Which are now the dominant mode of transportation in the western world. Even in Europe now, they are operating everywhere.\n\nYeah, but on some level \u2014 I don\u2019t mean to be taking the side of the optimist here, I\u2019m quite pessimistic about things, but on some level you could look at the story of the SUV expansion as a hopeful one. In the sense that in relatively short order, a relatively new technology spread very, very rapidly.\n\nBut this is not new. It\u2019s just simply the same thing. The wheels are the same, the engine is the same, it\u2019s a little heavier. It\u2019s just a real machine, but there\u2019s nothing fundamentally new about this. It\u2019s just simply heavier, it\u2019s bulkier, it\u2019s American, it\u2019s Texas, right? It\u2019s like steak. The French would eat filet mignon of 200 grams. You can have restaurants in Texas where there\u2019s a steak of 1,000 grams, 1 kg. There\u2019s nothing new in this, it\u2019s just the size.\n\nSure, but, still, the speed of penetration \u2026\n\nYeah, but it depends. The speed of deploying stuff you could study your whole life and you could not yet make sense out of it. It\u2019s just so difficult. Look, the best example, of course, is the cell phone. People are social animals, and want to gossip, and want to critique, and want to take dumb selfies, and want to put other people down and build themselves up. So cell phones spread like wildfire.\n\nNow, we have like what? It\u2019s like 4 billion of them for 7 and a half billion people. There\u2019s an example which is just the fastest penetration over a little gizmo ever in history of mankind, the mobile phone, which is not even a phone, really. It is just simply the gadget for self-aggrandizement. On the other hand, just a couple of days ago there was this headline. Nigeria went for three years without polio. They should have been done by 1960. Some things move very fast, but some things go very slowly.\n\nA few months ago I wrote a paper about netting the net, right?\n\nThe internet, you mean?\n\nIt\u2019s been such a blessing in so many ways, such a tremendous, unbelievable advance. On the other hand, you know, the black net, financial manipulation, invasion of privacy, pedophilia \u2014 it\u2019s a hell on earth, really. So, how do I net the net? Do I say it\u2019s been a benefit, or 80 percent benefit, or 75 percent benefit? I cannot do it. Maybe you could do it, but I cannot do it. And this is the problem I find with the humans and ecosystems, and humans and energy consumption.\n\nWhen I wrote that thing a couple of years ago, I said, \u201cWell, I cannot net the net.\u201d By now, I can net the net. I think it\u2019s been, certainly not an unmitigated disaster. There are many mitigations to it, and I\u2019m an avid user. But I think, on balance, I would say thumbs down, really.\n\nReading, for instance, has been in great peril for a long time now, because of television and so much visual stuff and everything. But now, even my so-called learned academic friends, I ask them all the time, and they read maybe one book a year. They just scroll through the net.\n\nWell, you could say that\u2019s reading too, though of a different kind and different quality.\n\nYeah, no, come on, David. It\u2019s not the same thing. I\u2019m reading very actively, so I\u2019ve been reading this book about the relationship between Sassanid empires and the Roman empire during late antiquity, 500 pages of it. You cannot find that on the net, right?\n\nProbably not. But actually, I wanted to ask you about the lessons of the internet \u2014 in particular how so many people have embraced a foolish idea of how easy scalability is and how seamless deployment of technology can be.\n\nThis is the thing \u2014 the contrast between what could be done and what we are doing. Let me give you an example of how things slide, even with people who are kind of paragons of virtue. When I started to buy Hondas, my Honda Accord was 900 kg. We\u2019re still buying Honda Accords, because even Honda, this virtuous company of small cars, started to make bigger and bigger items. Now Honda Civic is 30 percent bigger, heavier than my original Honda Accord was. I was in the dealership for an oil change the other day. I see a Honda Civic in the corner, one of them, and the rest of these six different kinds of SUVs. Honda the virtuous small-car company.\n\nHow easy would it be just simply to produce one Accord and one Civic, and no SUVs? We don\u2019t have to invent anything new. And the same goes about food, and same goes about building, and same goes about material consumption. Because materials are very highly energy intensive, really. So, even without inventing anything, just simply reshuffling the system, they can cut the slack.\n\nDo you see any culture, any country in the world that is moving in that direction?\n\nNo, nobody. Look at Germany. This transition to renewables \u2014 they put more than half a trillion dollars into installing affordable-type solar cells in a climate which is about as sunny as Vancouver or Seattle. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me; it\u2019s just crazy because they work about 11 percent of the time. The rest of the time, it\u2019s just simply too cold there.\n\nAt the first time that they started, somebody called me and said, \u201cCould you comment about the world\u2019s largest formal-type plants?\u201d I said, \u201cI would if I would know where it is.\u201d They said, \u201cIn Bavaria.\u201d I grew up a stone\u2019s throw from there, I couldn\u2019t believe it. And after half a trillion dollars they spent, the electricity generation is now about 30 percent from renewables, fine. But these are still the people who have no speed limit on the Autobahn \u2014 where cars go 250 km per hour. And Angela Merkel, she said, \u201cOh, we cannot have any limit on the Autobahn. We have to show how our cars can do it all.\u201d\n\nSo, they virtue-signal in terms of electricity generation, but they are burning the fuel on the Autobahn, and building huge diesel cars right, left, and center. So, even virtue in Germany is not virtuous at all.\n\nAnd they\u2019re also retiring nuclear plants.\n\nThat\u2019s another story, this fear of nuclear. These extreme reactions \u2014 either nuclear is very bad or very good, right? No. It\u2019s a tool to be used wisely, if you can use it wisely.\n\nBut to me, this is the thing that\u2019s just so emotional. I\u2019m an old man, so I shouldn\u2019t get so excited, but I still do get that excited about this thing. This whole debate about global warming, to me, it is so annoying. We knew, we got an inkling of it with Joseph Fourier in 1828. We were on pretty solid ground understanding the physics of it by 1860s. And by the time we got to Svante Arrhenius in 1895, he did the calculations, which are almost perfectly the same ones as we do now with these massive machines and 200,000 lines of code.\n\nI wrote my first paper about global warming in 1972. Then 20 years later, I made a decision never, never to write explicitly about global warming again, because it became just a total political football. People aren\u2019t even aware how long we\u2019ve known all these basic things. And most of the people who are talking about it, they\u2019ve never taken a course in atmospheric physics, or atmospheric chemistry. They have no idea what methane is, or N02. They have no idea what global warming potentially is.\n\nI hate when people ask me this question, but is there anything that gives you hope?\n\nPartially there is a \u201chope\u201d I would say in the sense that we are dying out. I\u2019m sure you are aware that essentially every western country, every affluent country has now started to fall below the replacement level of reproduction \u2014 2.1. Some countries come pretty close. Some countries are like 1.8, 1.9, including Sweden, Finland, Norway are pretty close. But most countries are now 1.6, 1.7, and there is a bunch of countries which are down to 1.3 or 1.4. As we have seen over the past three decades, once you get to 1.3 or 1.4, there\u2019s no more chance in hell that it could ever recover.\n\nJapan is losing now half a million people every year. All of Europe is below replacement level, Canada and U.S. are below the replacement level. If it wouldn\u2019t be for our legal and illegal immigration, and most of America will be dying out. So that is reason for hope: Years from now, we will not be consuming, because there will be nobody there.\n\nAnd yet even so, you think that we\u2019re scheduled to exceed the natural limits of the planet.\n\nThis is the thing. This is us, the rich part of the world. But the rich part is only depending how you count it, 1 billion. If you count the rich Indians, because there is lots of rich Indians and Chinese, and in the Middle East, there\u2019s probably like 1 and a half billion affluent people. But there is 7 and a half billion in total. And there\u2019s this discord between what we could do in rich countries and what simply cannot be done in poor countries. Poor countries will drive this program, no doubt.\n\nI always tell people this, we don\u2019t matter anymore. People talk about global problems. That our problem is their problem. Our problem is that we are dying out but still consuming like crazy. Their problem is that they want to consume like us, and they are increasing at a rapid rate.\n\n\n\nAnd you don\u2019t think there\u2019s any chance that they adapt for a different consumption pattern as they develop?\n\nEven if they did, it would still be a couple of generations of increasing consumption of everything in Africa. Everything, water, cement, fuels, you name it.\n\nDo you think, even over time, that kind of adaptation is possible?\n\nI\u2019m not trying to idealize this, because there are many obstacles. I have a super-insulated house, but it makes economically no sense, especially where I live, because we have the cheapest electricity on the planet. If I build a super-insulated house, return on that investment is probably like 25 years, or 18 years, or whatever it is. By that time, most of the people will not live in that house and who cares?\n\nOn top of which, people don\u2019t want to pay premium buying that house, really. People will not do this unless the price of energy goes up, up. If prices go up, people will start super-insulating and new houses will be better built. That may actually create quite a few jobs. On the other hand, if you don\u2019t have raspberries in January, then, of course, people in Mexico and Nicaragua are losing jobs. Truckers and shippers who are moving them to the U.S. or Canada are losing jobs. So these lowered expectations have to result in some improvements in employment and in some good economic growth, but of course, they will result in some losses. The same as with beef.\n\nAs you know, people aren\u2019t crazy about beef right now. Beef is killing the planet and whatever. \u201cLet\u2019s get totally out of beef.\u201d People don\u2019t even realize how beef is penetrating the U.S. economy. We are talking about millions of jobs. Not just the farmers themselves, but shipping it, cutting it, retailing it, exporting it. Millions of jobs hang on beef. So you become virtuous, you decrease your methane footprint, you get rid of beef, millions of jobs on the plate right now.\n\nAnd given how hard it\u2019s been to move away from coal in the U.S., which only employs tens of thousands \u2026\n\nThis is what I\u2019m telling you. It cannot be simply done without wrenchingly, massively centering our economy. It cannot be done on the margin only. It has to be done on a very large scale to have a large-scale global effect. And it has to be done in China, and in India, eventually, not only among the rich countries. It is the scale of the problem which is most important. We have many known solutions, we have many technical means how to fix things, we are pretty inventive, and we can come up with more, and better things yet. But it\u2019s a thing to deploy them in time and on the scale needed. That\u2019s our major problem, scale.\n\nHow much change would it take?\n\nTo do a dent in this global need for water, gas, oil, electricity, carbon emissions, whatever \u2014 to make that dent, you are talking about billions and billions of tons of everything. Let\u2019s say if you want to get rid of coal, right? We are mining now more than 7 billion tons of coal. So, you want to lower the coal consumption by half, you have to cut down close to 4 billion tons of coal. More than 4 billion tons of oil. You want to get rid of oil and replace it with natural gas? Fine and dandy, but you have to get rid of more than 2 billion tons of oil.\n\nThese are transformations on a billion-ton scale, globally: (A) They cannot be done alone by next Monday; (B) they will be wrenching with huge economic consequences; and (C), what we can do, and the Chinese can do, the Indians can not. The Indians published a new paper a few months ago saying, \u201cCoal will be our No. 1 fuel until 2047.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the downstream effects on politics and culture to think about. Over just the last decade or two, we\u2019ve seen how much frustration is produced by just the dampening of expectations for economic growth.\n\nExactly, yeah.\n\nWe\u2019ve moved from, I don\u2019t know, expectations of 3 percent or 4 percent to one percent or 2 percent. But then when I look at Japan, they\u2019ve been living through the same slowdown, or even a more dramatic slowdown, without the same sort of political perturbation we\u2019ve had in some of the West.\n\nOkay, this is the 40th year of me going to Japan. I\u2019ve been going there since 1979, almost every year. I\u2019m going again in October. I know a great deal about the country, but I still don\u2019t understand it in so many ways. But this thing, I understand: They have always been a country living within severe limited means. They were always used to, if not to sacrifice, then to live within great constraints. They never had excessive expectations. So this is such a culturally different thing. I have written about it extensively, and look at it in great detail, but I must say, it\u2019s an inappropriate example, because it\u2019s just Japanese. They are truly different than other people.\n\nYou look even in Europe, the people in Europe, the expectations are always lower in Europe than in the U.S. Always lower. But then you look at how these things have changed even there over the past 20 years. You go to Amsterdam or Copenhagen, and every bus has a big sign on the side of the bus: Amsterdam to Cyprus, 30 euros. These are the new expectations, Europeans travel like crazy. There are tens of millions of Europeans flying every week. Thirty years ago, hardly anybody was flying in Europe, really.\n\nExpectations like are created very rapidly. First, they went down to Spain or whatever \u2014 to Majorca maybe. Now, they go to Mauritius all the time. As I say, for 29 euros. Let me give you a study which people are not aware of. Until three years ago, 82 million Germans spent more money on foreign travel than 320 million Americans. Only in the last few years, Americans got slightly ahead in absolute terms. Which means in relative terms, they are still like one quarter of Germany. One quarter. Thirty years ago, no German, even businessmen, would fly \u2014 they would take a train from Berlin to Munich. Now, everybody is flying everywhere for 20 euros.\n\nAnd it\u2019s hard to imagine that stopping.\n\nI wish people would go the Japanese way. They come to Asia, they are eating less meat, and they are consuming less of everything. They are apparently not less \u2014 well, they were always an unhappy nation, but they are no more unhappy than they used to be.\n\nThis is what people forget. I see this \u201cEarth is flat\u201d nonsense. What\u2019s the name of this guy? This flat-earth guy? This New York Times guy? Friedman, right?\n\nThomas Friedman, yeah.\n\nYeah, this is utter nonsense. This world is so different, so differentiated. The guy must be, I mean, like IQ 65 to say something like that.\n\nWhere do the Europeans get those expectations? Why is it now that 30 years ago, things were so different than they are today? What happened?\n\nEverything is underlied by energy. As I always say, there is no economy, there is only energy conversion. Money is only a very imperfect way how to measure energy flows in society. So what happens is we got this supercheap energy \u2014 both the fuel, and electricity, and the food energy.\n\nWhen I was a kid growing in Europe, right after the Second World War, England had rationing. Even in England, a so-called victorious country after the war, England had rationing until 1953, 1954. Many European countries rationed food, and a typical spending for an average family in Europe in the 1950s was 60 percent of disposable income, went to food. Sixty percent, right? Now, in Europe, it\u2019s 18 percent, and in the U.S., it\u2019s about 8 percent or 9 percent. Food is more expensive in Europe, but it\u2019s still so much less expensive than ever it has been. So people have this enormous disposable income, and they travel, and they buy electronic junk, and they do all sorts of crazy stuff. Expectations have grown as a result of cheap energy, and cheap food, and energy.\n\nBut what if those prices reflected the true cost of energy extraction?\n\nYes, yes, exactly, David. We never know what the true cost is, because it depends where you put the boundaries on measuring the true cost.\n\nNobody\u2019s paying for it again. Again, the truer or closer real cost of food and energy should reflect the cost of all our waste, which we even don\u2019t incinerate, landfill, or we just simply dump into the ocean on the ground. We are not even trying to come close to the real cost of our economy, which is so much higher than we pay for. It\u2019s certainly not 8 percent of energy, or 8 percent of food, or 9 as it is in the U.S. now. It\u2019s vastly higher.", "description": "A conversation with scientist Vaclav Smil, author of Growth.
