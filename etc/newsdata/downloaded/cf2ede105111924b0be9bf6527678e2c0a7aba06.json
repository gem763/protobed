The president\u2019s personal lawyer William S. Consovoy argued that Trump should be shielded from investigation and prosecution on the part of federal and state authorities for the duration of his presidency, calling this principle \u201ctemporary presidential immunity.\u201d\n\nThe Post reports:\n\nAD\n\nJudge Denny Chin pressed Consovoy about the hypothetical shooting in the middle of Manhattan. \u201cLocal authorities couldn\u2019t investigate? They couldn\u2019t do anything about it?\u201d he asked, adding, \u201cNothing could be done? That is your position?\u201d \u201cThat is correct,\u201d Consovoy answered emphasizing that the immunity applied only while Trump is in office.\n\nImplicitly or explicitly, lawyers who make arguments such as these rely on the notion that there is another, proper way to punish a criminal president: impeachment and removal from office. But Trump himself rejects the legitimacy of impeachment. He has called the Democrats\u2019 exercise of their authority to conduct impeachment proceedings \u2014 a power the Constitution plainly grants the House \u2014 a \u201ccoup,\u201d \u201ccrap\u201d and a \u201clynching,\u201d declaring Monday that \u201cit\u2019s so illegitimate. This cannot be the way our great founders meant this to be.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThis is not just Trump freelancing before the cameras. Bloomberg reported Wednesday that the president approved a plan among ultra-partisan House Republicans to storm a secure impeachment hearing, which they did on Wednesday, stopping the testimony of a Pentagon official. In a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), White House counsel Pat Cipollone declared earlier this month that the executive branch would not cooperate with the House impeachment inquiry because \u201cthe President cannot allow your constitutionally illegitimate proceedings to distract him and those in the Executive Branch.\u201d Cipollone argued that the president\u2019s actions have been so \u201ccompletely appropriate\u201d that the House could have no legitimate reason to conduct an impeachment inquiry.\n\nSo the president\u2019s position, as described by his and his administration\u2019s lawyers, is that law enforcement at all levels of government may not investigate or prosecute him and that the president gets to decide when impeachment proceedings against him are constitutional. In other words, there are no checks on presidential behavior between elections every four years.\n\nAD\n\nThen again, Trump has also joked about seeking an illegal third term. So who knows what he would say if he lost the 2020 election. He has effectively declared that the United States has an elected king. He is not far off from claiming that he gets to decide whether an election result is legitimate \u2014 or the product of \u201cfake news\u201d and massive, invisible voter fraud.\n\nAD\n\nOn the bright side, there are still some in government \u2014 those the president\u2019s shameless press secretary Stephanie Grisham denigrated as \u201cradical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the Constitution\u201d \u2014 who see the conduct of national affairs as more than a partisan battle, a personality cult or a vanity project. Key executive branch witnesses, decorated and devoted civil servants, in the last two weeks defied Trump\u2019s insistence that no one testify before congressional investigators. Their accounts depicted a president who used the leverage of U.S. foreign policy to pressure a desperate allied country to fabricate a scandal about former vice president Joe Biden, one of the president\u2019s political rivals.\n\nAssuming that Trump does not, in fact, destroy the Republic, when he is gone and his toadies are swept from power, these \u201cradical unelected bureaucrats,\u201d such as former Ukraine envoy William B. Taylor Jr., will be remembered as heroes \u2014 and the lawyers who tried to assign dictatorial powers to a vile man will be remembered for what they are: collaborators.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "No investigation, no prosecution, no impeachment.
