Management should be applauded for making the decision to pull out rather than digging themselves a bigger hole.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"COMPLEX SITUATION\"\n\nDomino's has struggled to control costs in its overseas business, especially in Norway, where it was converting the local pizza operator Dolly Dimple's stores it bought in 2017.\n\nWith 57 stores in Norway, the company set a turnaround plan in the country during the quarter but early signs from the plan were mixed and improvement in sales were weaker than expected, the company said.\n\nAdding to the company's woes, Europe's economy has slowed this year as the U.S.-China trade tensions weakened global growth, and consumers and businesses in and around the United Kingdom worried about the impact of Brexit on jobs and incomes.\n\n\"Although the impasse with the UK franchisees is ongoing, the decision to exit the loss-making international markets in an orderly manner releases one of the constraints on the share price,\" Peel Hunt analysts said.\n\nThe company said third-quarter group system sales rose 3.4% to 313.5 million pounds ($400.15 million) on strong demand in the UK and Ireland. However, international system sales fell 2.7%. It also warned of a decline in tourist numbers in Iceland.\n\nThe company has 63 franchisees in Britain and seven in Ireland, with two of the largest franchisees accounting for 39% of stores.\n\n\"Normal working practices continue to be impacted by our franchisee dispute ... this situation is complex and we expect a resolution to take time, certainly into 2020,\" Wild said on the profit sharing row.\n\nThe company said the search for a new chief executive continues while it also looks for a new chairman.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Tanishaa Nadkar in Bengaluru and writing by Noor Zainab Hussain; Editing by Deepa Babington)", "description": "The decision to exit four European markets comes a few months after the company announced CEO David Wild would retire, in the midst of a row with disgruntled franchisees in the UK and Ireland over commercial terms.
