He won\u2019t leave you alone for a second. There are no off days. He\u2019s a real worrier, too.\u201d\n\nAnd you suspect there are no off days even when his players are away for the best part of a fortnight on \u00adinternational duty as Guardiola \u00adaddresses a sticky start to the Premier League season.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nHe took last Sunday\u2019s home defeat to Wolves pretty calmly, just as he was phlegmatic about the reverse at \u00adCarrow Road.\n\nBut the odds against those two \u00adresults were enormous. It was a 500-1 double.\n\nOf course it is ludicrously early to start calling the title Liverpool\u2019s to lose but if City do not defend their crown, they will reflect on those games as defining defeats.\n\nAnd Guardiola will painstakingly analyse his own \u2018performances\u2019 in those fixtures.\n\n(Image: PETER POWELL/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nDid he select the right team? Should Bernardo Silva have played from the start against Wolves?\n\nMore crucially, he might be \u00adwondering if, after more than three years of his demands, the players can maintain the sort of intensity Aguero refers to.\n\nThere are also long-term challenges ahead.\n\nThis will be 33-year-old David Silva\u2019s final season at the Etihad, Fernandinho turns 35 next May, Aguero 32 in June.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nGuardiola has a contract until the summer of 2021 and if he sees it out, that will have been five years at City \u2013 one more year than he spent as \u00adBarcelona manager before calling an emotional end to his tenure at the Nou Camp.\n\n\u201cI have given everything and I have nothing left and need to recharge my batteries,\u201d Guardiola said when he left his beloved Barca. \u201cThe demands have been great and I have not been able to rest much.\u201d\n\nNow in his fourth year at City no one could deny Guardiola \u2013 whose wife Cristina will now be spending more time at home in Spain \u2013 has given and continues to give \u00adeverything.\n\nHe had admitted to being \u00ad\u2018exhausted\u2019 after winning a \u00adtreble last season and \u00adfollowing up on seasons when his team accumulated 100 points and 98 points was always going to be a\u00ad \u00admountainous challenge.\n\n(Image: Manchester City FC via Getty Ima)\n\nWhile Jurgen Klopp appears to have the same intensity as Guardiola, the pressure has, arguably, been less for the German.\n\nGuardiola, with his track record and with the lavish investment of his club\u2019s owners, has been expected to deliver from day one.\n\nHe has even suggested he will be deemed some sort of failure if a Champions League is not delivered.\n\nHe will not, of course. But that sort of expectation has to weigh heavily on Guardiola\u2019s shoulders.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nWhile the prospect would be \u00adwonderful not just for City fans but for football fans in general, the idea that Guardiola would create a Sir Alex Ferguson-style dynasty at the Etihad was always fanciful in the extreme.\n\nIt is unlikely his two friends at the top of the power-chain, Ferran \u00adSoriano and Txiki Begiristain, believe their man will extend his stay beyond the end of his current deal.\n\nNeither, though, would he walk out during a season.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nBut to win a third successive \u00adPremier League title from this \u00adposition and go deep into the Champions League with a squad that, for all its brilliance, has glaring defensive deficiencies, will take a Herculean effort.\n\nAnd that is why it would be no \u00adsurprise at all if this season was \u00adGuardiola\u2019s last. And that is why we should all enjoy him while we can.", "description": "Pep's contract runs out in 2021 but it could be his last season in Manchester", "authors": ["Andy Dunn", "Image", "Reuters", "Peter Powell Epa-Efe Rex", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Manchester City Fc Via Getty Ima", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20568512.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-City-FC-vs-Wolverhampton-Wanderers-FC-United-Kingdom-06-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
