The White House statement is the first official confirmation.\n\nHis death \u201cnot only deprives al-Qa\u2019ida of important leadership skills and the symbolic connection to his father, but undermines important operational activities of the group,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nOsama bin Laden was famous for directing the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that killed nearly 3,000 Americans. He was killed in a Navy SEAL operation in 2011 under President Obama.\n\nMr. Trump said the younger bin Laden, believed to be about 30 years old, was responsible for planning and dealing with terrorist groups.\n\nThe U.S. named Hamza bin Laden as a \u201cspecially designated global terrorist\u201d in 2017 after he called for terror attacks in the West in published recordings.\n\nSaudi Arabia revoked his citizenship earlier this year.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
