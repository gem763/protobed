That\u2019s definitely the implication in some of the actor\u2019s recent comments while promoting his latest movie, Ford v Ferrari. In an interview with British GQ, Damon said director James Cameron offered him a part in the fantasy film and a potentially sweet backend participation deal, but he had to decline. \u201cJim Cameron offered me Avatar,\u201d Damon said. \u201cAnd when he offered it to me, he goes, \u2018Now, listen. I don\u2019t need anybody. I don\u2019t need a name for this, a named actor. If you don\u2019t take this, I\u2019m going to find an unknown actor and give it to him, because the movie doesn\u2019t really need you. But if you take the part, I\u2019ll give you 10 percent of \u2014 \u201d at which point the actor apparently stopped talking before finishing the thought.\n\nSo, it seems like he was heading toward mentioning a cut of the film\u2019s box office, but we can\u2019t be sure. (If we were sure, that would mean Damon missed out on a share of Avatar\u2019s $2.8 billion global gross.) But because Matt Damon is already very rich, his biggest regret today is not about the money (some Robert Downey Jr. money); instead, he just wishes he could have worked with James Cameron. Alas, he was busy with spy duties. \u201cIt would have caused a problem for Paul Greengrass and for all my friends on The Bourne Ultimatum, so I couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d said Damon, who had a little more to add to the anecdote. \u201cI told John Krasinski this story when we were writing Promised Land,\u201d he said. \u201cI tell him the story and he goes, \u2018What?\u2019 And he stands up and he starts pacing in the kitchen.\u201d And with that, John Krasinski has never been more relatable.", "description": "Matt Damon had to turn down a role in Avatar from James Cameron, potentially leaving an insane amount of money on the table.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/02/02-matt-damon.w1200.h630.jpg"}
