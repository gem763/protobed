(Carsten Koall/Getty Images)\n\nBERLIN \u2014 Joshua Wong, one of the most recognizable pro-democracy advocates from Hong Kong, left Germany for the United States on Thursday after a visit that provoked fierce Chinese criticism of Berlin and has raised questions over how the West can confront Beijing over its repressive human rights record.\n\nWong, who had been in Germany since Monday to rally foreign support for a nearly four-month-old protest movement against encroaching Chinese influence in Hong Kong, had urged German leaders to speak more forcefully against China\u2019s bid to exert control over the semiautonomous territory.\n\nWith China-backed authorities in Hong Kong using more violent means to subdue the unrest, the visit was expected to be a diplomatic balancing act for German officials from the start. It also came only days after a subdued and largely business-focused visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel to China.\n\nEven though Wong did not meet with Merkel during his Berlin visit, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas had a brief encounter with the activist during an event Monday night \u2014 which sparked a fierce response from Beijing and the summoning of the German ambassador there.\n\nChina also called a rare news conference at its embassy in Berlin, but excluded a journalist from Bild, the German tabloid that had invited Wong to the event where he and Maas met.\n\n\u201cWhat happened now, I unfortunately have to say, will have negative consequences on bilateral relations and the Chinese side has to react,\u201d Chinese Ambassador Wu Ken said during the news conference on Wednesday. Resorting to unusually confrontational language, he suggested that German politicians who met with Wong may have wanted to \u201cadd fuel to the fire and thereby make political capital out of it.\u201d\n\nTo some, this week\u2019s diplomatic spat appeared to be triggered by differences in style between the cautious Merkel and Maas, her more spontaneous and vocal foreign minister.\n\nBut looming over the fallout of Maas\u2019 meeting were broader questions over how Germany \u2014 and other Western nations \u2014 should confront Beijing over rights abuses amid deep economic dependency and the growing assertiveness of the Chinese leadership.\n\n\u201cIt has always been difficult to navigate this,\u201d said Jan Weidenfeld, an analyst at the Berlin-based Mercator Institute for China Studies. But in recent months, two new factors have emerged, Weidenfeld said: First, a \u201cgreater public scrutiny\u201d in Germany and other countries toward China\u2019s actions; and second, a growing German awareness of European Union pressure on Merkel, as one of the continent\u2019s key leaders, to speak up for Hong Kong.\n\nThose demands from smaller E.U. member states have gained more urgency in recent months, as protests in Hong Kong \u2014 initially directed against an extradition bill \u2014 turned into a full-blown rebellion against Beijing.\n\nAfraid that the protests could spillover to mainland China, the Beijing has stepped up propaganda efforts and intimidation campaigns against opponents like Wong \u2014 a leading figure in the 2014 Umbrella Movement.\n\nIn Europe this week, Wong criticized Western powers over what he considers to be their complacency on China\u2019s treatment of critics.\n\nWong could hardly have chosen a more symbolic venue for his own news conference, which took place the same day the Chinese Ambassador lashed out at German officials.\n\nSitting in Germany\u2019s federal news conference center \u2014 located on what was a stretch of no man\u2019s land between East and West Germany until the fall of the Berlin Wall \u2014 Wong framed his confrontation with Beijing as part of the world\u2019s \u201cnew Cold War.\"\n\nThat symbolism may have struck a nerve with history-conscious Germans, even 30 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. But that appeal runs up against a striking economic reality: Germany relies on Chinese exports more than any other E.U. nation and is now facing the threat of a recession.\n\nChina was the third-biggest export market for German companies last year, behind the United States and France.\n\n\u201cI understand that business leaders and politicians in Germany worry that if they directly confront China on its human rights abuse it would jeopardize future deals,\u201d said Wong, before adding that the E.U. has a stated commitment to combat human rights abuses.\n\nThe vast majority of Merkel\u2019s visit to China last week was dedicated to economic ties, even though Merkel did voice criticism of Beijing\u2019s handling of the unrest in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cI have advocated for a peaceful resolution of conflicts, as everything else would be a catastrophe from my perspective,\u201d Merkel said during her visit.\n\nAt the time, she faced little pushback from the Chinese side over her remarks, which is why diplomats were even more stunned by Beijing\u2019s harsh criticism of Merkel\u2019s foreign minister days later. Some saw the unexpectedly harsh condemnations as a sign of things to come.\n\n\u201cThis is a new way of doing diplomacy,\u201d said Weidenfeld.\n\nIn the past, China had often conveyed its displeasure in private.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually more directed at domestic audiences than at a German audience,\u201d said Weidenfeld. \u201cThey care much more about sending those messages back home and showing the people: This is outrageous.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nUnder Hong Kong\u2019s streets, the subway becomes a battleground for protesters and police", "description": "Looming over the diplomatic spat were broader questions over how Germany and other Western nations should confront Beijing over rights abuses.", "authors": ["Rick Noack", "Foreign Affairs Reporter Focusing On Europe", "International Security", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/kJr0jOqahiwrLRgOAs3ON2Kt7uY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AXBQ4ZWUPMI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
