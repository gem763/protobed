It included HSBC Group Chief Executive Noel Quinn, Blackstone (NYSE: ) Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) Group Chief Operating Officer John Waldron\n\nThe Oct 29-31 gathering will also include Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House senior adviser Jared Kushner.\n\nLast year's event was dominated by leaders from Asian and Arab countries.\n\nModi has said he expects Riyadh to invest in downstream oil and gas projects in India as part of a strategic partnership. He is expected to meet Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Tuesday. chief executive Amin Nasser was not present at FII on Tuesday as he was meeting investors abroad ahead of the offering.\n\nAramco's IPO, for which de facto ruler Prince Mohammed is seeking a $2 trillion valuation, remains the biggest lure for investors. It is a pillar of his ambitious economic diversification drive.\n\nIn January, Saudi Arabia said it had ended a 15-month crackdown on corruption that he had ordered, noting it had received more than $106 billion in assets through settlements after rounding up almost 400 royals, ministers and executives.\n\nThe world's top oil exporter has struggled to attract foreign investment to fund projects outside the energy sector as investors hesitate over the commercial viability of projects and Riyadh's human rights record.\n\nDespite last year's boycott, the kingdom managed to ink multi-billion dollar deals at the 2018 FII although it was Aramco that clinched most of them. A major announcement teased by Prince Mohammed ahead of that event never materialised.\n\nProceeds from the Aramco IPO will boost the Saudi investment fund's ability to back domestic mega-projects including NEOM, a futuristic $500 billion city announced at FII in 2017 but on which there has been little progress so far.
