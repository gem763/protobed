If the game is postponed it will not be replayed but marked down as a 0-0 draw - meaning England would progress as Pool C champions.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nA statement from tournament chiefs did nothing to ease concern, saying: \u201cThe latest modelling by our weather information experts indicates that it is now tracking north and east and will bring strong winds and heavy rain to Tokyo and surrounding areas on 12 October.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to closely monitor this developing situation in partnership with our weather information experts, local authorities, transport providers and the teams,\n\n\u201cPublic and team safety is our number one priority. While we have robust contingency plans in place for pool matches, such plans, if required, will only be actioned if the safety of teams, fans, and workforce can be guaranteed.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nWisemantel said: \u201cWe have no control over the weather and we have to prepare for the game and see how it goes,\n\n\u201cRegarding the permutation around the game and shared points we are just concentrating on playing to win.\n\n\"One thing I have learnt in Japan is that they prepare for the worst and then usually it doesn\u2019t eventuate.\u201d", "description": "The Japan Meteorological Agency is now projecting Typhoon Hagibis to clip the southeast, near Tokyo and Yokohama", "authors": ["Alex Spink", "Image", "Getty Images", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20465346.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_England-v-Argentina-Rugby-World-Cup-2019-Group-C.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
