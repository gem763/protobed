Riot police responded by firing teargas and water cannons.\n\nIndonesia's criminal code: what is it, why does it matter, and will it be passed?

The anti-graft commission is frequently under attack by lawmakers who want to reduce its powers.\n\nWidodo told reporters on Monday that the government would not forbid student demonstrations and called on protesters to avoid damaging public facilities.\n\nWidodo said last Thursday that he was considering revoking the new anti-corruption law. However, the idea was immediately opposed by members of his coalition in parliament who want to reduce the powers of the anti-graft agency.", "description": "Thousands of demonstrators protest legislation they say stymies anti-corruption agency", "authors": ["Associated Press In Jakarta"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfd12c3f9b7410c459ddb0d87cf9f97c15ff944e/0_114_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4188322efad93a147dab217eccfa43ee", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
