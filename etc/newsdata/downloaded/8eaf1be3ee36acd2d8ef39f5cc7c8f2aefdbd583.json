It\u2019s not his actual campaign that\u2019s in truly dire straits. Although Elizabeth Warren has risen steadily, troubling donors already troubled by Biden\u2019s age, he\u2019s still first or second in most polls and shows few signs of tumbling too far from the top of the field. He could do without the attention President Trump and the impeachment situation have brought to Hunter Biden. But to the extent that his son\u2019s business dealings may receive intense scrutiny, it\u2019s far more likely to become a concern if Biden wins the nomination. Here in the nomination fight, his fellow Democratic candidates will be wary of echoing Trump\u2019s attacks. No, Joe Biden the candidate, is mostly fine. Joe Biden is in trouble because should he win the general election, then Joe Biden\u2014the president\u2014will be unable to govern. The Biden theory of change, the central argument of his campaign, is unraveling before our very eyes.\n\nOne of Biden\u2019s early expositions of that argument came in January during a speech before the United States Conference of Mayors. Still undeclared, he made a nod to speculation about his intentions and the criticisms his campaign would be subjected to. \u201cI read in the New York Times today that one of my problems if I were to run for president, I like Republicans,\u201d he said. \u201cOK, well, bless me father for I have sinned.\u201d Here he crossed himself to laughter and applause. \u201cFrom where I come from, I don\u2019t know how you get anything done. I don\u2019t know how you get anything done unless we start talking to one another again.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs proof of his ability to get us talking to one another again, Biden has offered, both in private fundraisers and on the stump, anecdotes about his personal success in bridging ideological divides throughout his career, including stories about the relationships he built with segregationists like James Eastland and Herman Talmadge. Despite the controversies those remarks spurred, polls suggest the larger message he wanted them to convey has resonated with a large share of Democratic voters, who would like to believe, as Biden insists, that we\u2019ll return to a more productive politics after Trump leaves office. \u201cThe thing that will fundamentally change things is with Donald Trump out of the White House,\u201d Biden said at a May campaign stop in New Hampshire. \u201cNot a joke. You will see an epiphany occur among many of my Republican friends.\u201d\n\n\n\nBiden\u2019s Republican friends are abetting the president\u2019s attacks on his son and smearing House Democrats\u2019 efforts to hold this administration accountable.\n\nIn the meantime, Biden\u2019s Republican friends are abetting the president\u2019s attacks on his son and smearing House Democrats\u2019 efforts to hold this administration accountable. The responses of House Republicans to the impeachment inquiry have been fairly predictable, although Rep. Matt Gaetz did offer up a stunner of a line Tuesday morning. \u201cWhat we see in this impeachment is a kangaroo court,\u201d he said, \u201cand Chairman [Adam] Schiff is acting like a malicious Captain Kangaroo.\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy made a more serious gaffe on 60 Minutes last week when he falsely accused anchor Scott Pelley of altering the White House\u2019s transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky to make Trump sound worse.\n\n", "description": "The former vice president believes he can restore comity between the parties, but Trump's impeachment is proving him wrong.", "authors": ["Osita Nwanevu"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/d7e637d2a53d320c194e7589b4fa74ed2fbce0f8.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
