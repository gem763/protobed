(AP) - In Kansas City\u2019s first game after manager Ned Yost announced he will retire after the season, the lowly Royals burst to a six-run lead in the first three innings and beat the NL East champion Atlanta Braves 9-6 Tuesday night behind three hits and two RBIs from Nicky Lopez.\n\nYost, who turned 65 last month, was hired by the Royals in May 2010 and led Kansas City to consecutive AL pennants and the 2015 World Series title, the second in team history and first since 1985. The Royals are 58-100 in their third straight losing season.\n\nAtlanta, assured it will start the NL Division Series at home on Oct. 3, is 96-62. The Braves need to win all four of their remaining games to reach 100 victories for first time since 2003.\n\nDanny Duffy (7-6) allowed three runs and five hits in five innings, improving to 2-1 in his last six starts.\n\nJulio Teheran (10-11) gave up six runs and six hits in 2 1/3 innings. He has lost three straight starts, giving up 14 earned runs in 11 1/3 innings.\n\nHunter Dozier hit a sacrifice fly in the first, and the Royals broke open the game with a five-run third that included Alex Gordon\u2019s RBI single, Ryan O\u2019Hearn\u2019s sacrifice fly and a two-run double by Bubba Starling, who went to third on the throw home and scored when catcher Brian McCann\u2019s throw to third went into left field for an error.\n\nFrancisco Cervelli and Ozzie Albies homered for the Braves.\n\nAtlanta center fielder Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. was removed after two innings as a precaution because of left hip tightness. Acu\u00f1a leads the Braves with 41 homers and is three steals shy of 40.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nBraves OF Ender Inciarte, out since Aug. 10 with a right hamstring strain, is expected to test his leg by running the bases Wednesday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBraves RHP Mike Soroka (13-4, 2.60 ERA) starts Wednesday\u2019s finale of the two-game series against LHP Mike Montgomery (3-9).\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "In Kansas City's first game after manager Ned Yost announced he will retire after the season, the lowly Royals burst to a six-run lead in the first three innings and beat the NL East champion Atlanta Braves 9-6 Tuesday night behind three hits and two RBIs from Nicky Lopez.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dick Kaegel"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/braves_royals_baseball_74622_c0-132-3168-1979_s1770x1032.jpg?d492b88cd4b761f57e1df750b03ebf4d8ed9f94b", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
