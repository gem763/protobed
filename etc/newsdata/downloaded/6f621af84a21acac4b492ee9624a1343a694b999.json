Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the finance committee, documented deep connections between the beleaguered gun group and Maria Butina, who in December pleaded guilty to conspiring to act as a Russian agent without registering with the Justice Department. Wyden\u2019s report, released Friday and undertaken without the cooperation of committee Republicans, indicates that greed motivated some NRA officials to engage in the outreach.\n\nButina also made clear to NRA officials long before their controversial Butina-facilitated December 2015 trip to Moscow that Alexander Torshin, her patron and an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was a man with mysterious pull in the Kremlin. She emailed former NRA president David Keene in January 2015 that Torshin\u2019s appointment to the Russian central bank was \u201cthe result of a \u2018big game\u2019 in which he has a very important role. All the details we can discuss with you only in person.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring the 2016 election, Russian nationals effectively used the promise of lucrative personal business opportunities to capture the NRA and gain access to the American political system,\u201d Wyden said.\n\nRepresentatives for the NRA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn addition to scrutinizing the December 2015 NRA trip, Wyden found that the NRA hosted former Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak for a three-hour tour of its headquarters in August 2015. Kislyak was a key figure in Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference before former national security adviser Mike Flynn pleaded guilty to misrepresenting his conversations with him to the FBI. An NRA calendar entry provided to Wyden suggests that NRA leaders took Kislyak hunting at the Grand National Waterfowl Hunt weeks before the Moscow trip.\n\nWyden\u2019s report shows the NRA officials, donors, and supporters meeting with Russian officials under U.S. sanctions during the Moscow trip, something previously reported. But it also shows that Butina ensured the NRA would send sufficiently senior leaders, something necessary to enhance Torshin\u2019s prestige, by dangling opportunities for NRA luminaries to enrich themselves. While U.S. sanctions do not make meeting with foreigners under sanction illegal, U.S. nationals can\u2019t conduct business with them.\n\nReturning from Moscow further inclined the NRA to aid its Russian friend Butina, who presented herself as the head of a rare Russian gun-rights foundation. Soon after, the NRA bought Butina and Torshin memberships in a hunters\u2019 advocacy group known as Safari Club International. Later, one of the key NRA figures on the Moscow trip, Pete Brownell, confirmed to Wyden that he personally introduced Butina to Donald Trump Jr. at the NRA\u2019s 2016 annual meeting, though Brownell\u2019s counsel dismissed it as a \u201cchance encounter.\u201d Butina would also write to NRA heavies for formal invitations to their events, something she said would help her get visas to enter the country.\n\nThe NRA has attempted to distance itself from the Moscow trip after it became politically controversial. It told Wyden\u2019s office in May that any relationship \u201ccertain individuals, including NRA supporters and volunteers\u201d had with Butina and Torshin was entirely distinct from NRA business.\n\nYet Wyden\u2019s report shows then-NRA president Allan Cors, who backed out of the trip, contemporaneously referring to it in an email to Torshin as a chance to \u201crepresent the NRA\u201d to influential Russians. Among those Russians were Butina\u2019s reputed moneyman, Igor Pisarsky, whom Butina presented as Putin\u2019s \u201ccampaign manager\u201d; the sanctioned Russian deputy prime minister for the defense industry, Dmitry Rogozin; and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. Documentation the NRA provided, the report notes, did not show \u201caction to discourage or prevent its officers from using organization resources to explore business opportunities or to meet with sanctioned individuals and entities\u201d during the trip.\n\nCors\u2019 absence from the trip was a problem for Butina. Without a senior NRA leader to show off to the influential Russians who had agreed to meetings, Torshin could lose face. \u201cMany powerful figures in the Kremlin are counting on Torshin to prove his American connections\u2014a last minute important member cancellation could affect his political future,\u201d she emailed. In November, Butina turned to Brownell, the NRA\u2019s then-vice president and Cors\u2019 future successor, with an urgent plea for his attendance.\n\nOutside the NRA, Brownell runs a business that sells guns, ammunition, and firearms accessories. A Brownell spokesperson told The Daily Beast in February that Brownell took the trip \u201cunderstanding that it was an NRA-related event organized with the support of the organization.\u201d His corporate compliance officer later said Brownell could meet with sanctioned Russians insofar as his trip was not business but an NRA \u201ccultural exchange.\u201d\n\nBut materials Wyden acquired cast doubt on that. Butina, in emails, told Brownell that while it was an NRA trip, \u201cespecially for you and your company I have something more.\u201d She told him that Russian gun manufacturers \u201care ready to meet you and talk about export and import deals.\u201d Another email, this one from Brownell, records the NRA vice president musing that he was \u201cnot interested in attending if [it is] just an NRA trip.\u201d In another email, Brownell called the \u201cstrictly diplomatic\u201d trip a chance to \u201cintroduce our company to the governing individuals throughout Russia.\u201d Among the people the NRA met with in Russia were representatives of the Kalashnikov Concern, a weapons manufacturer under U.S. sanctions. The report states that later Brownell explored a deal with someone he met on the trip but ultimately canceled because the Russian was unable to follow proper import-export rules.\n\nBrownell recently resigned from the NRA\u2019s board, a move seen as part of the organization\u2019s recent turmoil. In April, its president Oliver North resigned after losing a power struggle to longtime NRA magnate Wayne LaPierre. The group is locked in bitter litigation with its former ad firm, which might be the least of its legal woes, considering investigations into its tax status by attorneys general in New York and the District of Columbia.\n\nA representative for Brownell did not immediately respond to a request for comment .\n\nBrownell was not the only one to whom Butina appealed with an offer unrelated to NRA business. Wyden\u2019s report corroborated a Daily Beast report that Butina told trip attendee Keene, who was also the Washington Times\u2019 opinion editor, that one of the meetings was with a Russian media oligarch who would be able to secure Keene an interview with Putin for the paper.\n\nButina also dangled to the NRA a meeting with Putin himself, though no such meeting appears to have manifested. An email ahead of the trip from Butina\u2019s since-indicted boyfriend, the GOP consultant Paul Erickson, to Brownell promised \u201cprivate meetings with the top ministers in Putin\u2019s government and private lunches in oligarch\u2019s dachas.\u201d Butina fronted money for the attendance of another trip attendee, NRA donor Jim Liberatore, for which the NRA reimbursed her with $6,000 from its president\u2019s budget.\n\nThe NRA was an open door for Butina and Torshin, whose goal was to use the organization as a lever to move U.S. politics in a direction more agreeable to Russian interests. In addition to welcoming the two to the NRA\u2019s own events, the NRA aided them in attending other conservative-friendly gatherings, including the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, a staple event for politicians of both parties. Butina asked then-presidential candidate Donald Trump a question about U.S.-Russian relations at a campaign stop in Las Vegas, boasted of being a conduit for his campaign\u2019s communications to Russia, and was photographed with prominent GOP politicians like Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.\n\nWyden stopped a step short of recommending the NRA lose its tax-exempt status, citing insufficient cooperation from the group. \u201cA broader review of NRA\u2019s activities in recent years\u201d from the IRS was needed to determine if the NRA\u2019s Russian connections fit within a \u201cpersistent pattern of impermissible conduct,\u201d the report concluded.\n\n\u201cThe totality of evidence uncovered during my investigation, as well as the mounting evidence of rampant self-dealing, indicate the NRA may have violated tax laws. This report lays out in significant detail that the NRA lied about the 2015 delegation trip to Moscow,\u201d Wyden said. \u201cThis was an official trip undertaken so NRA insiders could get rich\u2014a clear violation of the principle that tax-exempt resources should not be used for personal benefit.\u201d", "description": "When the NRA visited Moscow in 2015, it wasn\u2019t just to strengthen ties to Putin allies.
