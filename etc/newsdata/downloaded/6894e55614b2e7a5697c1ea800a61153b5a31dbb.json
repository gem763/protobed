There remains a view that BHP is a seller.\n\nBut that might not be the lay down misere once imagined.\n\nGiven the switch to dry stacking of Samarco\u2019s tailings, and shift in risk and environmental impact that implies (more water recycled, for example), there is a lot to like about the pellet business in a steel materials world, where customers could pay increasingly high levels of premium for high-grade material.\n\nConsider, for example, that pellets \u2013 like lump ore \u2013 can be fed directly into a traditional blast furnace or its electric arc equivalent. That means they do not have to go through the emissions-heavy sintering process that gets the fine iron ore products into a fit state for primary reduction.\n\nNot quite going to plan\n\nSo what are the complications that landed with Friday\u2019s sign-off on a plan to store 80 per cent of Samarco\u2019s production waste as dry tailings and with the balance being pumped to an old pit that is contained by impervious bedrock?\n\nWell, it does appear that not all in the approval process has gone as anticipated by Samarco\u2019s management.\n\nThe pathway to a recovered operation announced on Friday by Samarco management describes a much, much slower ramp-up to full production than the map that was presented to the owners of $US3.8 billion ($5.6 billion) worth of the Brazilian pellet-makers bonds through presentations late last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose November presentations were the precursor to an ultimately failed attempt to restructure Samarco\u2019s debt, which has been in default since 2016.\n\nThe miner\u2019s bond holders were offered a series of financial forecasts predicated on a rapid three-stage recovery to full production of 26-27 million tonnes annually of 62 per cent grade iron ore pellets.\n\nThe presentation slide pack, made public on the Samarco website, foreshadowed nearly 8 million tonnes of production in 2020, a doubling of that through 2021-22 and then a two-year step-up to something better than 26mtpa.\n\nBased on that production trajectory and an iron ore price outlook made to look excessively conservative by a second dam disaster, this time wholly owned by Vale, the projections presented to the bondholders had Samarco running a positive EBITDA by 2022 that would by 2024 settle over the long term at $US1.4 billion annually\n\nThe bondholders were advised that Samarco would be cash flow positive by 2021 and that a $U123 million surplus would quickly step up to between $US300 million and $US800 million over subsequent years.\n\nThis positive view in free cash flow goes to the heart of the dispute between Samarco, its owners and its creditors. But more of that a bit later.\n\nFor reasons not wholly clear, but which seem to slow the volume of wet tailings Samarco will be able to store and the constraint created by the need to move to a 100 per cent dry-stacked tailings system, the top range of future production capacity has been trimmed while the schedule for its achievement has been pushed out by at least five years.\n\nA decade to peak production\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe statement released by Samarco in the wake of Friday\u2019s news suggested it would be at least a decade before the business was in a position to operate the three concentrators that it requires to run at full capacity. Samarco indicated as well that the ceiling for future production would range between 22mtpa and 24mtpa.\n\nThe company said it would now take about six years from the receipt of its environmental approval to introduce its second concentrator and that this would allow production to increase to 14mtpa to 15mtpa.\n\nAgain, that is well shy of the 16mtpa to 19mtpa flagged as the capacity of a two concentrator operation.\n\nEven with higher iron ore prices, this lowering of the ceilings of concentrator capacity and the extension of the timeframe for hitting them will demand a redraft of the free cash flow projections so critical to the interests of the bondholders.\n\nEmails published on the Samarco website earlier this year throw a lens on the biggest issue of contention that keeps the company and its creditors \u201cfar apart\u201d on efforts to restructure that debt.\n\nVale and BHP want their money back\n\nThe emails, written in December last year and in January, reveal that BHP and Vale had sought equal ranking with pre-existing creditors for the debt they have provided Samarco since the Fundao disaster.\n\nThey imply too that Vale and BHP expect repayments of both the \u201crescue\u201d financing of Samarco provided in the wake of the Fundao disaster and of the contributions they have each made to the vehicle of disaster mitigation, the Renova Foundation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is also clear Vale and BHP expect that Renova\u2019s future operation will be afforded by Samarco from cash flows ahead of any calculation of free cash pool that will support both the bond debt and the shareholder debentures.\n\nThat an operational Samarco would relieve the shareholders of the funding of Renova was always obvious. That the business would also repay BHP and Vale\u2019s investment in the restart was a possibility that had not occurred to me. And rest assured, that is an awful lot of money. BHP\u2019s accounts carry a $US1.9 billion provision for its share of the investment in sustaining Samarco and providing for its disaster mitigation.\n\nIn December, the steering committee that represents Samarco\u2019s bondholder group wrote to the company rejecting the proposed treatment of shareholder debentures that had been used to provide sustaining capital to the business and the funding the shareholders have provided directly to the Renova Foundation.\n\nThe bondholders\u2019 position at that point was that both layers of the new shareholder lending should be converted to equity or subordinated to a layer behind the pre-existing debt.\n\n\u201cThe creditors believe that addressing this fundamental issue first will expedite resolution of the additional issues and overall restructuring,\u201d the steering committee wrote.\n\nIn January, Samarco responded to that idea through the agency of its lead adviser to the restructuring effort, the Los Angeles-based investment bank Houlihan Lokey.\n\n\u201cThe SD (shareholder debentures) and RRO (Fundacao Renova) have been essential to the funding of the environmental remediation, the compensation of impacted communities, the advancement of the required environmental licence processes and the investments to maintain and restart Samarco\u2019s operations,\u201d the firm wrote.\n\n\u201cThis funding was provided at a time of critical need and on attractive terms to the company, when no other source of financing was available. As such, the SD and RRO have provided substantial benefits to Samarco and its stakeholders, including the creditors.\n\n\u201cAs the creditors know, in restructuring rescue financing typically ranks senior in priority to pre-existing debt and must be paid off in full before other financial creditors receive any recovery.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, Samarco\u2019s latest proposal contemplates treating the SD and RRO in a manner that is significantly more factorable to the creditors relative to typical rescue financings. This is a meaningful concession in order to facilitate a consensual restructuring of Samarco financial debts,\u201d Houlihan Lokey advised.\n\nWhile there have been further attempts to revive this renegotiation, that \u201cconsensual\u201d moment has remained elusive.", "description": "The environmental approval for the agency of BHP's humiliation in Brazil has landed with plans for a slower return to business as usual than once forecast", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2793%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_110%2C$y_5/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7a5cc7ed49586308c579763535712e4748d75c7d", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
