A big heart, yes.\u201d\n\nRoberts unveiled a framed and signed No. 32 jersey from Hall of Fame pitcher Sandy Koufax. Roberts said the Dodgers found out from Bochy\u2019s brother that Koufax was his childhood idol.\n\n\u201cWith the greatest respect for your past, I wish you health and happiness in the future,\u201d read Koufax\u2019s message.\n\nRoberts, who at 5-foot-10 is 5 inches shorter than Bochy, hugged his former manager.\n\nBochy doffed his cap. He didn\u2019t address the crowd but whispered in Roberts\u2019 ear.\n\n\u201cBruce said if Tommy Lasorda was presenting this gift he wouldn\u2019t be getting a gift,\u201d Robert said, \u201cso he understands the rivalry, too.\u201d\n\nComing into the game, Bochy had 1,993 career victories, putting him 11th all-time among MLB managers. The 10 men ahead of him are all in the Hall of Fame.\n\nBochy has a career mark of 218-204 against the Dodgers in his stints as manager of the Giants and previously the San Diego Padres.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of battles here. Some good ones and some tough ones,\u201d Bochy said before the game.\n\nHis favorite was in 1996.\n\nSan Diego came into Los Angeles trailing the Dodgers by two games in the NL West standings with three remaining. The Padres swept the series to win the division by one game.\n\n\u201cI thought about it a little bit coming in today,\u201d Bochy said. \u201cThe battles we\u2019ve had here, the great games. Rivalries. Not just here but down south, San Diego. Probably last day I\u2019ll think about it a little bit more.\u201d\n\nRoberts played for the Padres in 2005 and 2006, which coincided with Bochy\u2019s final two years in San Diego.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been around anyone that has that feel (for the game),\u201d Roberts said.\n\nBochy will see the division-leading Dodgers one more time. They visit San Francisco to close out the regular season.\n\nBochy announced in February that this would be his final season, ending the tenure of the longest-serving active manager in the majors.\n\n\u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of things I\u2019m going to miss,\u201d he said.\n\nHe seemed to leave the door open a crack, saying, \u201cWill I step back and say, \u2018You know what, I\u2019ve got to see if I can still do it or not?\u2019 I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m good with it right now. I mean, you never know.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFreelance writer Jolene Latimer contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: www.apnews.com/MLB and www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Dodgers set aside their fierce rivalry with the Giants for a few moments to honor San Francisco manager Bruce Bochy.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Beth Harris"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/06/giants_dodgers_baseball_14745_c0-420-2575-1921_s1770x1032.jpg?97085de53a6b1117ba4eb18d319b16a50697cd38", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
