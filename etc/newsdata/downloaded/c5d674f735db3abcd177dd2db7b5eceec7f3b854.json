Chicago-based Boeing hopes to use pilots in a campaign to reassure travelers once regulators approve changes that the company is making to the plane.\n\n\u201cWe believe this lawsuit is meritless and will vigorously defend against it,\u201d Boeing responded, in a statement from spokesman Charles Bickers. \u201cWe will continue to work with Southwest Airlines and its pilots on efforts to safely return the Max to service.\u201d\n\nSouthwest had more Max jets than any airline when the plane was grounded in March. The union said the grounding has eliminated more than 30,000 Southwest flights.\n\nThe president of the pilots\u2019 union said in an interview that the lawsuit followed failed negotiations with Boeing over compensation for more than $100 million in income that pilots have lost due to canceled flights. Also at issue were the union\u2019s expenses to comply with a subpoena from the Justice Department, which is conducting a criminal investigation into Boeing\u2019s representations to regulators who certified the plane.\n\nThe union leader, Jon Weaks, said he believes Boeing will make the plane safe and pilots will resume flying it.\n\n\u201cWhen the plane comes back, it will be one of the most examined airplanes ever,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problems they had with MCAS are being engineered out of it.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit, however, uses harsh language in condemning Boeing for what it told airlines and pilots about the Max, which went into service in 2017. Boeing sold the plane as a more fuel-efficient but otherwise lightly modified version of the 737, which has flown since the 1960s.\n\n\u201cThose representations proved to be false,\u201d the union says in its lawsuit. \u201cThe 737 MAX now is grounded worldwide because it is unsafe, unairworthy, and contrary to Boeing\u2019s representations, distinct from the 737 family of aircraft that preceded it, which SWAPA pilots have flown for years.\u201d\n\nBefore both crashes, MCAS was activated by faulty sensor readings and pushed the planes\u2019 noses down. The union charged that Boeing abandoned good design practices and withheld key safety information from regulators in its rush to get the plane on the market.\n\nThe lawsuit cited news accounts for many of its claims. Investigations have not been completed into crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people.\n\nBoeing faces dozens of lawsuits filed by passengers\u2019 families and has settled a few for undisclosed terms. In July, it announced a $4.9 billion after-tax charge to cover compensation it expects to pay airlines in coming years to cover canceled flights.\n\nBoeing expects the Max to fly again this year. Southwest dropped the plane from its schedule through Jan. 5, and Weaks said he doesn\u2019t expect it back until February or March.", "description": "DALLAS (AP) \u2014 The union representing Southwest Airlines pilots is suing Boeing, saying its pilots are losing money because the company rushed an unsafe", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/07/56e83d_boeing-plane-southwest-pilots-38702-in-wednesday-may-2019-file-photo-workers-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
