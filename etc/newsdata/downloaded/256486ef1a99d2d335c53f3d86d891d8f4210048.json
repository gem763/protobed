This week in Stuttgart, she earned her 21st World medal to become the most decorated woman in gymnastics history; she also added two new gravity-defying skills to the gymnastics code.\n\nBiles is the undisputed figurehead of women\u2019s gymnastics and clear favourite for tonight\u2019s all-around competition, but following in her footsteps, her US teammates are flying too.\n\nIn the wake of Biles\u2019 historical triple double somersault at the 2019 US championships, compatriots Mykayla Skinner and Jade Carey posted videos of their own versions on social media.\n\nBut emerging as Biles\u2019 strongest contender is newcomer Sunisa Lee, the 16 year-old whose all-around score at US trials placed her within 0.350 of 1st place. This is touching distance and closer than anyone has come in years; the points difference only represents a couple of steps on landings. Lee\u2019s performance came just one week after her father, a former Marine, fell off a ladder and was left paralysed from the waist down.\n\nDebuting at the World Championships this week, Lee already has a team gold to her name. Individually she trailed Biles by over 2 points in qualifying, after a fall from the beam. But a stunning uneven bars routine saw her fly over the top bar in a fully-extended body position: a rarely-performed released named after the Russian gymnast Nabieva. On this piece she has outscored Biles in both her performances this week, thanks to complex release combinations performed with amplitude.", "description": "Simone Biles has lifted the boundaries of what was considered possible in her sport and beyond.", "authors": ["Myriam Cawston", "Brian Moore", "Luke Edwards", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/gymnastics/2019/10/09/TELEMMGLPICT000212490085-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq-yKXUOr_MwQ_nCnkwkIf1OhAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
