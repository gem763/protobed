Ruby was just born and Davina was idly scrolling through properties in Cornwall.\n\nThey ended up renting a tiny house in Perranporth, got the kids into school and ended up buying a derelict old miners' cottage in Redruth.\n\nTodd worked on renovating the house while Davina, who had been a professional photographer in London, worked in Spar and the Cornish Pizza Co.\n\nShe added: \"We had all these bills and all this pressure.\n\n\"It was not my ambition from being a successful photographer in London to working in a supermarket.\n\n\"And we were beginning to get burnt out by the property thing. Todd and I were used to camping - we met working at festivals - so we rented out the house in Redruth and started to look for land.\"\n\nThat dream piece of land eventually came up - a 7 -acre agricultural plot, on the cliffs and right on the heritage coast path.\n\nInstead of the campsite they envisaged, they realised they'd have to actually work the land. But it was too good an opportunity to miss.\n\nThe sale went through and they got four Cornish black pigs and some chickens and started working the land right away.\n\n(Image: Cornwall Live /SWNS.COM)\n\n(Image: Cornwall Live /SWNS.COM)\n\nDavina continued: \"We rented locally for that time and we were going up there every day working the land.\n\n\"It was just a completely empty field. We had to drag containers of water up the hill. On one day our pig arc blew off the cliff and I had to climb down and drag it back up.\n\n\"We had no income and we were investing in the land.\"\n\nWithin a few months, they were running out of money and had no choice but to move out of their rented home and move onto the land.\n\n\"We had a horsebox and a shack Todd built out of some pallets and the bell tent. We had some ducks and some geeses.\n\n\"We decided to do 28 days camping because that's allowed in the scope of the land. Everyone loved it, we got some great reviews.\n\n\"But I fell pregnant over that summer and I was sick every single day and all night. I got insomnia, so I didn't sleep. It was so cold and wet. It just rained and rained.\n\n\"And then we went into winter and it was brutal and then in March the Beast from the East came and I swear to god I had snow on the end of my bed and I was eight months pregnant.\"\n\n(Image: Cornwall Live /SWNS.COM)\n\n(Image: Cornwall Live /SWNS.COM)\n\nDavina and Todd have now established Cligga Cliff Farm at the heart of the Perranporth community and are heavily involved with Plastic Free Perranporth, even setting up a monthly plastic free market.\n\nNow on the first Sunday of every month, Cligga Cliff is there at the forefront of the Plastic Free market selling free range pork and eggs and vegetables as part of a collective.\n\nThey've even got cows now and have started their own micro-dairy. They get day old turkeys in July and rear them up for Christmas and have 16 litters of piglets every year.\n\n\"By the end of next summer we'll be self sufficient,\" says Davina.\n\nCligga Cliff Farm produce is available from Perranporth Plastic Free market on the first Sunday of every month and can be found on its website here.", "description": "Davina Foster, 36, and her partner Todd live almost entirely self-sufficiently in Cornwall with their four children, Michael, 15, Saffron, 11, Ruby, 6, and Harry, 18 months", "authors": ["John Bett", "Jacqui Merrington", "Image", "Cornwall Live", "Swns.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20577897.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_OFF_GRID_003.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
