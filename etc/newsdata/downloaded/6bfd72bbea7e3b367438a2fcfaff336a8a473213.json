But this Wallabies season has had the feel of a constant experiment. The future could yet be bright in the right hands.\u201d\n\nEddie Jones\u2019 England outscored Australia four tries to one, with the Wallabies running themselves into trouble as they constantly tried to exit their territory with ball in hand.\n\nIt extended England\u2019s winning run over Australia to seven matches, earning them an enticing semi-final against the All Blacks.\n\nThe Australian broadsheet\u2019s Wayne Smith called England \u201csmarter, more clinical\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs suddenly as switching off the lights, Australian rugby was plunged back into darkness,\u201d he said, blasting Cheika\u2019s \u201cfuzzy plans and slipshod execution\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor all the passion he brought to the Wallabies coaching job, he brought no real order to their game, no tight framework they could fall back onto when England began to apply the screws,\u201d added Smith.", "description": "Sydney (AFP) \u2013 Australian rugby has been \u201cplunged back into the darkness\u201d by their \u201chumiliating\u201d quarter-final World Cup", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/e6b279_wallabies-thumped-by-old-enemy-england-40-16-in-sydney-daily-telegraph-called-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
