The award includes a cash prize of about $103,000.\n\n\u201cI am part of a global movement of school children, youth and adults of all ages who have decided to act in defense of our living planet,\u201d Thunberg said in a statement. \u201cI share this award with them.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

If she is selected next month, Thunberg would become the youngest person ever awarded a Nobel Prize \u2014 a distinction currently held by Malala Yousafzai, who received the Nobel Peace Prize when she was 17.\n\nThunberg spoke at the United Nations Climate Action Summit on Monday, denouncing world leaders for failing to take action to stop climate change.\n\n\u201cYou all come to us young people for hope. How dare you?\u201d she said. \u201cYou have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words, and yet, I\u2019m one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing.\u201d\n\nWrite to Katie Reilly at Katie.Reilly@time.com.", "description": "Teen activist Greta Thunberg was named one of the 2019 recipients of the Right Livelihood Award, known as the \"Alternative Nobel Prize\"", "authors": ["Katie Reilly"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/greta-thunberg-alternative-nobel.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
