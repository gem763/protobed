It is hoped that the purchases, which swap reserves for Treasury bills, will relieve stress in the bank funding market.\n\nEarlier this week, Jerome Powell indicated that the Fed would start to expand its balance sheet but insisted the policy should not be considered a new phase of quantitative easing because it was not aimed at generally loosening the stance of monetary policy or boosting economic growth. Instead, Powell said, the new purchases would be undertaken for technical reasons relating to the bank funding market.\n\nIn addition, the Fed said it will conduct overnight repo operations at least through January.\n\nOn Thursday, bank regulators from the Fed announced that they would ease bank liquidity requirements. Although such a change has long been contemplated and is not directly tied to the recent tensions in the repo market, it could ease some of the conditions that led to that stress.", "description": "The Fed is back in the business of buying Treasury bills again but it really, really doesn't want you to call it QE. | Economy", "authors": ["John Carney"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/12/wi/afp/07/b87198_federal-reserve-board-chairman-jerome-powell-try-future-strike-an-elusive-e1544471668169.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
