Mr. Trump in tweets accused Democrats and the media of starting a \u201cUkraine Witch Hunt.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden, speaking to reporters while campaigning in Des Moines, Iowa, angrily pushed back against the president\u2019s assertions, denouncing Mr. Trump as \u201ca serial abuser\u201d whose interactions with Ukraine represented an \u201coverwhelming abuse of power.\u201d\n\nThe exchange followed a Journal report on Friday that said Mr. Trump in a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged him about eight times to work with Mr. Giuliani on an investigation into Mr. Biden, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nMr. Trump on Saturday said the call was \u201cperfectly fine and routine\u201d but didn\u2019t address whether he had pressured Mr. Zelensky to investigate the Democratic front-runner.\n\nMr. Giuliani has suggested that Mr. Biden as vice president worked to shield from investigation a Ukrainian gas company whose board counted Mr. Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, as a member.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden greeted guests at the Polk County Democrats' Steak Fry in Des Moines, Iowa, on Saturday.

The probe into the company was no longer active when Mr. Shokin was removed from office in 2016.\n\nYuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general at the time, said earlier this year he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Mr. Biden or his son.\n\nMr. Biden told reporters in Des Moines on Saturday that he had never discussed with his son any overseas business dealings and called for Mr. Trump to be investigated.\n\n\u201cHe is violating every basic norm of a president,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cHe\u2019s using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me.\u201d\n\nThe scrutiny of Mr. Trump\u2019s dealings with his Ukrainian counterpart is likely to escalate in the coming weeks as Congress continues to probe a whistleblower complaint said to be about the president\u2019s dealings with at least one foreign leader. Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire is scheduled to appear next week before both the Senate and House intelligence committees, where he will be asked about his decision not to share the complaint with lawmakers.\n\nOn Saturday, Mark Zaid, a prominent national security lawyer who has represented whistleblowers for over 20 years, said on Twitter he had joined the legal team of the still-unidentified whistleblower. The complainant is represented by Andrew Bakaj, a former intelligence and Pentagon official who runs his own practice focused on whistleblower matters.\n\n\u2014Dustin Volz contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com and John McCormick at mccormick.john@wsj.com", "description": "President Trump pressed on with calls for an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden after The Wall Street Journal reported that Mr. Trump repeatedly pressured his Ukrainian counterpart to undertake such a probe.", "authors": ["Rebecca Ballhaus In Washington", "John Mccormick In Des Moines", "Rebecca Ballhaus", "John Mccormick", "Rebecca.Ballhaus Wsj.Com", "Mccormick.John Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109599/social", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
