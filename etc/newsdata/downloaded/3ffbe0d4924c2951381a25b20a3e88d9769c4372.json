Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., are fueling their presidential campaigns by generating anger toward the wealthy.\n\nWarren is blasting America\u2019s \u201cextreme concentration of wealth,\u201d while Sanders is condemning wealth inequality as \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cgrotesque.\u201d Both want to hammer the rich with a new annual wealth tax.\n\nModerate candidates on the debate stage Tuesday night were right to call Warren\u2019s and Sanders\u2019 tax and spending plans unrealistic. The almost twin leftists are also oblivious that wealth inequality may reflect starkly different economic causes. As such, their broad-brush denunciations of wealth are a useless guide to public policy.\n\nConsider three different causes of wealth inequality: cronyism, crowding out and capitalism.\n\nCronyism\n\nCronyism means businesses gaining subsidies and narrow regulatory benefits at public expense. Farm subsidies, for example, cost taxpayers and go to the wealthiest farmers. Cronyism increases inequality and undermines the economy, and so Warren and Sanders are right to complain about it.\n\nCrowding out\n\nCrowding out refers to government social programs displacing private wealth-building. Social Security, for example, reduces incentives for private retirement saving, and the program\u2019s heavy payroll taxes reduce the ability to save.\n\nCrowding out mainly affects the non-wealthy, so it increases wealth inequality. Warren and Sanders want to expand social programs, but that would make this problem worse.\n\nCapitalism\n\nThe two candidates are also wrong about capitalism. The explosion of new technologies in recent decades has made many entrepreneurs rich. The Forbes list of the wealthiest Americans includes many people such as Robert Pera, founder of Ubiquiti Networks, which brings low-cost internet to underserved and rural areas around the globe. Such billionaires help uplift the poor, so punishing them with a wealth tax \u2014 as Warren and Sanders propose \u2014 makes no sense.\n\nThe three causes of wealth inequality are evident in cross-country comparisons. Sanders complains that the United States has more wealth inequality \u201cthan any other major country on earth.\u201d It is true that our Gini coefficient is fairly high at 85, according to Credit Suisse. Ginis range from 0 to 100, with higher numbers meaning more wealth inequality.\n\nYet such metrics tell us nothing without knowing the causes. America\u2019s wealth inequality is partly caused by cronyism and crowding out, but the main cause is our dynamic economy. Entrepreneurs are gaining wealth by innovating, and that raises overall growth and living standards.\n\nWarren and Sanders want more equality, but they would not want to live in most of the countries that have it, such as Ethiopia, Burma and Pakistan. Those countries have low Ginis of 61, 58 and 65, respectively, indicating a high degree of equality \u2014 but it is an equality of widespread poverty.\n\nSome countries have higher wealth inequality than America, including Egypt (91), Kazakhstan (95), Russia (88) and Ukraine (96). What do those countries have in common? High levels of cronyism or corruption, according to Transparency International. In these countries, cronyism is a cause of both high wealth inequality and the generally low living standards.\n\nAnother group of countries has low corruption yet high wealth inequality, including Sweden (87), Denmark (84) and Norway (79). The problem, Credit Suisse notes, is crowding out: \u201cstrong social security programs . . . can greatly reduce the need for personal financial assets . . . This is one explanation for the high level of wealth inequality we identify in Denmark, Norway and Sweden: the top groups continue to accumulate for business and investment purposes, while the middle and lower classes have a less pressing need for personal saving than in many other countries.\u201d\n\nConsider a different economic metric that we can all agree on. The United Nation\u2019s Human Development Index measures each country\u2019s income levels, life expectancies and educational opportunities. Across 167 countries, the index shows modest positive correlation with wealth inequality as measured by the Gini coefficients \u2014 the opposite of what Sanders or Warren might think. Countries with open market economies \u2014 such as the United States \u2014 provide opportunities for entrepreneurs to become wealthy, and that in turn generates growth and raises overall human development or living standards.", "description": "Moderate candidates on the debate stage Tuesday night were right to call Warren\u2019s and Sanders\u2019 tax and spending plans unrealistic.", "authors": ["Chris Edwards"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
