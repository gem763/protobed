It's part of our nightly routine,\" Davis said. \"And we noticed a pattern of defeat.\n\n\"Because every time the winner moved on to the final round...And, you know, at the beginning they have that intro. You know, \u2018I\u2019m married to my beautiful wife of 20 years,\u2019 \u2018I'm married to my handsome husband of 15 years,\u2019 \u2013 well, inevitably, when that person, won and you saw a picture of the quote, unquote beautiful wife, I would turn to my wife and I would say \u2018Apparently, our definition of beautiful, differs greatly,'\" Davis quipped.\n\n'WHEEL OF FORTUNE' HOSTESS VANNA WHITE REVEALS THE ONLY ARGUMENT SHE AND PAT SAJAK HAVE EVER HAD IN 36 YEARS\n\nThat's when Davis said he and his wife concocted the ruse while watching the show one evening.\n\n\"I told her, I said, 'Listen, if I ever get on 'Wheel of Fortune,' I'm going to get up there and I'm going to keep it real,\" he said. \"This was, you know, 80 percent her idea.\"\n\nOn Monday night's show, Davis left Sajak's mouth hanging when he said point-blank: \"I\u2019ve been trapped in a loveless marriage for the last 12 years to an old battle-axe named Kim.\"\n\nHe continued: \"She cursed my life with three stepchildren named Star, RJ and Ryan, and I have one rotten grandson.\"\n\nVANNA WHITE PRAISES ALEX TREBEK'S STRENGTH, 'WILL TO CONQUER' AMID PANCREATIC CANCER BATTLE\n\nBlair said that his wife and grandson were in the audience that night. He explained his wife specifically didn't want him to call her his \"beautiful wife\" on the show.\n\n\"She said, 'I don't want you ever to call me your beautiful wife. I don't want you ever to call me your gorgeous wife,'\" Davis said. \"I mean, we're 50, you know what I mean? So we've been together for 15 years. And 15 years ago, I was probably much more handsome than I am now, you know. So I'm under no misconceptions about who I am or what I look like. So, you know, we figured that we poke some fun, and we have a good time doing it. And like I said, keep it real.\"\n\nHe went on to say that he can get away with calling his wife, Kim, \"an old battle-axe,\" because it's an integral part of the couple\u2019s expressive dynamic that has allowed them to stay together for 15 years.\n\n'WHEEL OF FORTUNE' CONTESTANT LOSES PRIZE MONEY AFTER ACCIDENTALLY GUESSING NSFW ANSWER\n\n'I told her, I said, 'Listen, if I ever get on 'Wheel of Fortune,' I'm going to get up there and I'm going to keep it real.' \u2014 Blair Davis\n\n\u201cYou know, she is not the gregarious or outgoing type,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, she's very confident and a very intelligent woman, but she's very reserved and shy at times. So, you know, it was incumbent on me to speak the truth.\"\n\nAs for his \"rotten grandson?\"\n\n\"Oh, he and I are best buddies. You know, just like I said on 'Wheel of Fortune,' I don't have any children of my own. I inherited three great, awesome step-kids,\" Davis said. \"And they're older, you know. They're 30, 26 and 23. And I got a hold of them in their early teens, late teens.\"\n\n8 WORST WHEEL OF FORTUNE FAILS\n\nDavis also shared that Sajak, 72, gave him props for the remarks during the commercial break.\n\n\"[Sajak] leaned in at the commercial break and he goes, 'Now, that was funny.' You know, he's been doing this for I don't know, 30-plus years. So he was very, I wouldn't say guarded, but he was cool, you know what I mean? It's Pat Sajak!\"\n\nDavis said he had a blast in appearing on \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d and said \"it's been crazy\" after he went viral over his cheeky remarks.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The next morning my phone started ringing from New York to Washington state, from Wisconsin to Louisiana and everywhere in-between. I have probably gotten three or four dozen calls, yours included.\"\n\nFox News\u2019 Andy Sahadeo contributed to this report.", "description": "The \"Wheel of Fortune\" contestant explained that it was in fact his wife who was the mastermind behind the elaborate scheme to tip the scales in their favor.", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Blair Davis", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/blair-davis-wheel-of-fortune-display.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
