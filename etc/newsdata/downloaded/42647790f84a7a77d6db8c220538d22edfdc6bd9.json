The killing was captured on an officer\u2019s dashboard-mounted camera, and the court-ordered release of that footage a year later had contradicted officers\u2019 statements with their version of events.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Kevin Hagen/Getty\n\nMcDonald\u2019s death was among a streak of high-profile killings involving white police officers and black men - in many cases unarmed - leading to mass demonstrations and protests and galvanising a Black Lives Matter movement that challenged institutional racism and police relationships with black communities.\n\nLast year, Van Dyke was sentenced to six years and nine months in prison after being found guilty of second-degree murder and 16 counts of battery with a firearm. He was the first Chicago police officer to be charged with first-degree murder for an on-duty killing in more than 30 years.\n\nDocuments released by new Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s administration collect officer interviews, statements and summary reports from a 2016 investigation by Chicago Inspector General Joseph Ferguson. The reports have largely remained hidden from the public but became a focus of Ms Lightfoot\u2019s campaign and her subsequent request to Chicago\u2019s City Council to give the mayor\u2019s office authority to release sensitive documents with public interest.\n\nIn a statement, Ms Lightfoot said the release of the documents \u201crepresents the first of many steps we are taking to ensure our city operates with nothing short of the highest levels of transparency\u201d.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He retired in 2016.\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s office also concluded that Sgt Stephen Franko, who was fired for his role in the cover-up, had knowingly approved Van Dyke\u2019s false statements to establish the department narrative.\n\nThe investigation also revealed that other officers had lied and said they had heard Van Dyke yelling for McDonald to drop a weapon, statements that \u201cbolster a false narrative which might offer justification for the shooting\u201d. Those officers would not have been able to hear Van Dyke from where they said they were standing, and four other officers failed to record what was happening, according to the report.\n\nIn his report, Mr Ferguson recommended the department fire 11 of the officers involved with McDonald\u2019s killing. Ultimately, only four were let go, and with the exception of Van Dyke, none were criminally charged.", "description": "A previously unreleased trove of documents related to the Chicago police killing of a 17-year-old black teenager found that officers had lied about what they saw that night and\u00a0destroyed evidence and changed witness statements.
