Tedesco said she was concerned because Madelyn wasn\u2019t meeting milestones. At that point she wasn\u2019t yet talking, she didn\u2019t start walking until nearly 3 years old and she wasn\u2019t potty-trained until age 6.\n\n\u201cWe were told that she did not have autism because she was very social,\u201d Tedesco told Fox News. \u201cWe didn't know what to call it, it was just kind of thrown into this global development delay category because basically no one could identify exactly what the situation was.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until Madelyn was 9 that she received an autism diagnosis, one that her mother said she was waiting to discover.\n\n\u201cBecause of those delays, I really wanted to find out what was impacting her in that way to delay her in so many areas,\u201d Tedesco said.\n\nMany parents share a similar story to Tedesco\u2019s.\n\nIn 2018, approximately 1 in 59 children were diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD)\n\nIn 2018, approximately 1 in 59 children were diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThe CDC states that ASD can sometimes be detected at 18 months or younger, and by age 2, a diagnosis can be considered very reliable. Yet, new research published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry suggested some autistic children don\u2019t show traits of the disorder until age 5 or later.\n\nBLUE HALLOWEEN BUCKETS RAISE AUTISM AWARENESS, MOM\u2019S VIRAL POST SAYS\n\nIn children with ASD, a late diagnosis could delay important educational and behavioral services. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), with early intervention, some children with autism can even make so much progress that they are no longer on the autism spectrum when they are older.\n\n\u201cSometimes autism can be challenging to diagnose, especially for kids that are less severely affected,\u201d Dr. Alexander Kolevzon, the Clinical Director of the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai in New York told Fox News. \u201cOne of the challenges that we're looking for is the absence of features. The absence of eye contact, the absence of respondent to your name.\u201d\n\nAutism Speaks, an autism advocacy organization, lists several other signs of autism, including;\n\nDifficulty understanding other people\u2019s feelings\n\nDelayed language development\n\nPersistent repetition of words or phrases (echolalia)\n\nResistance to minor changes in routine or surroundings\n\nRepetitive behaviors (flapping, rocking, spinning, etc.)\n\nPersistent preference for solitude\n\nDiana Robins, the Interim director and professor at the AJ Drexel Autism Institute, said the biggest signs that parents and professionals should look out for revolves around their social ability.\n\n\u201cSo toddlers who are not looking at people or responding when people talk to them, toddlers who are not pointing,\u201d Robins told Fox News. \u201cThere are a lot of ways that we can communicate before we have the words to communicate verbally and so think of all the things you can do with your hands to indicate things. And toddlers are doing that. They're reaching up to be picked up. They're waving hello and goodbye. They're blowing kisses. And so the lack of these social engagement skills and social communication skills are among the first signs that we're looking for.\u201d\n\nEven though Tedesco\u2019s doctors didn\u2019t accurately diagnosis her daughter with ASD the first time she was screened, she doesn\u2019t put the blame on anyone.\n\n\u201cIt's not like shame on you. It's more about let's educate the educators or train the trainers kind of thing, where you go out and share what you have,\u201d Tedesco said.\n\nMany experts believe that a late ASD diagnosis can be made for several reasons. One being the issue of parents or physicians not noticing the symptoms until they become more distinct.\n\nBARBER ACCOMMODATES BOY WITH AUTISM, CUTS HAIR OUTSIDE\n\n\u201cIt may take some time to be able to notice that this child is acting differently from their peers,\u201d said Robins, who also leads the Research Program in Early Detection and Intervention for ASD at Drexel. \u201cThis might be especially true for children who have some strengths, such as early verbal skills or really strong problem-solving abilities, because they may be able to use those streams to mask or hide their challenges, and in those cases, the symptoms will be even harder to measure until the social demands increase and they can no longer compensate with those verbal or problem-solving abilities.\u201d\n\nAnother issue Robins said comes into play are the disparities in access to health care.\n\n\u201cWe know that families who are from racial or ethnic minorities or from lower income backgrounds may not have as high quality or as solid access or steady access to high quality health care. And so if you're not seeing those experts, it will take longer to get a diagnosis,\u201d she said.\n\nSome parents may not know that under the Child Find mandate, schools are legally required to find children who have disabilities and need services. It covers every child from birth through age 21 and is part of a federal law called the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which protects the rights of students with disabilities. Under the IDEA law, states must provide all eligible children with a free and appropriate public education that meets their unique individual needs.\n\n\u201cIf your child is diagnosed or even if you're just concerned, you can contact your [school] district and they will do that evaluation,\u201d Kathleen VanTol, an associate professor of education at Dordt University told Fox News. \u201cThey will do a global evaluation and determine why your child is struggling and then provide that early intervention.\u201d\n\nSpecialists may start out by conducting a developmental interview and direct assessment.\n\n\u201cThe developmental interview is with parents and focuses on understanding a child\u2019s early language, social communication, play skills and the presence of restricted interests and repetitive behaviors,\u201d Michelle Lee, a clinical assistant professor in the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at NYU Langone Health told Fox News.\n\nLee said a direct assessment includes interview questions about the child\u2019s understanding of emotional experiences and social interactions.\n\nScreening procedures have advanced significantly over the years. The Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) and Gilliam Autism Rating Scale, Third Edition (GARS-3) are the most widely used tools for the assessment of ASD. They can help parents identify the struggles their children are facing so they can seek appropriate help, whether that be in the form of speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy or behavioral therapy.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThe more information you have, the more power you feel \u2014 you're empowered with that information,\u201d Tedesco said. \u201cThat would be my hope for all the families that are diagnosed to take it and see it as a positive and go out and find all the resources that are available to help you through your journey.\u201d", "description": "New research suggests some autistic children don\u2019t show traits of the condition until later in life, causing parents to miss the signs and physicians to misdiagnose.
