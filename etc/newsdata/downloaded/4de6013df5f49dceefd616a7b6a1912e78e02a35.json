Sean Duffy as Contributor", "language": "en", "text": "CNN announced Sunday that former Rep. Sean Duffy (R-WI), an ardent supporter of President Donald Trump, has joined the news network as a contributor.\n\nCNN host Jake Tapper revealed on his State of the Union program that Duffy had joined the network, saying, \u201cLet\u2019s bring in new CNN contributor, commentator and former congressman Sean Duffy. Thank you for being here and congratulations on joining the CNN family.\u201d\n\nIn his first appearance, Duffy defended President Trump for raising the prospect that Ukraine could have more information on the Democratic National Committee\u2019s (DNC) email server, which was hacked in 2016.\n\n\u201cWe spent two years on a Russian investigation, right,\u201d he stated. \u201cAnd Democrats and the media were all about what happened in the 2016 election. What Mick Mulvaney said\u2026 let\u2019s get the server, the DNC server that had everything to do with the Russia investigation.\u201d\n\nDuffy announced his retirement from Congress in August to spend more time with his family; his wife Rachel Campos-Duffy, a Fox News contributor, delivered their ninth child in the fall.\n\n\u201cRecently, we\u2019ve learned that our baby, due in late October, will need even more love, time, and attention due to complications, including a heart condition,\u201d Duffy said in a Facebook post at the time. \u201cWith much prayer, I have decided that this is the right time for me to take a break from public service in order to be the support my wife, baby and family need right now. It is not an easy decision \u2013 because I truly love being your Congressman \u2013 but it is the right decision for my family, which is my first love and responsibility.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker stepped down from his seat on September 23rd.\n\nDuffy, who represented Wisconsin\u2019s 7th district since 2011, has been mentioned as a possible candidate for Senate or governor in 2022.", "description": "CNN announced Sunday that former Rep.
