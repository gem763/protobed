In addition to that, as you know, they're pouring money into their economy,\" Trump told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House.\n\nIt's an argument Trump has used before.\n\n\"So far our consumer is paying nothing - and no inflation,\" he tweeted in August.\n\nThe president also said a September meeting to discuss trade with the Chinese was still happening even though both countries just imposed even more tariffs on each others' goods.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We are talking to China, the meeting is still on, as you know, in September. That hasn't changed. ... We can't allow China to rip us off more as a country,\" Trump said on Sunday.\n\nHe downplayed the plight of farmers, many of whom say the trade war is cutting into their profitability in an already-tough industry.\n\n\"We\u2019re taking in tens of billions of dollars, we're giving some of the money to the farmers. I'm making the farmers more than whole. The farmers are doing better than if China, frankly, were buying,\" Trump said.\n\nPolitical and financial experts weighed in on the latest moves in Trump's trade war.\n\n\"I disagree with the president when he said trade wars are easy to win. I don\u2019t know what history books he\u2019s referring to, but that\u2019s never the case,\" former Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel told Fox Business Network's Gerry Baker in an interview that aired Sunday.\n\n\"There are severe consequences in a trade war for everyone,\" Hagel continued. \"If we start to approach this on who\u2019s winning, the U.S. or China, that's the wrong, that's a dangerous approach. Because it continues to divide you in a very dangerous way where, no matter what, I\u2019m going to win, and they\u2019re going to lose. Zero sum game. That\u2019s not the way it works. Not a global, liberal, free trade economy.\"\n\nFinancial expert Priya Misra of TD Securities said she wasn't seeing a positive outcome from the stretched-out tariff battle on \"Bloomberg Real Yield\" on Sunday.\n\n\"Last Friday, the tone [between the U.S. and China] went very negative, very dark. The fact that we didn\u2019t have a further darkening of that tone mattered for the broader macro market. But if you look at the structural issues between the U.S. and China, we\u2019ve had the same issues for the last two years \u2014which is IP [intellectual property], which is cyber. I\u2019m not seeing any progress there. Politically, neither side has any incentive to agree to a weak deal, so how do they sell this to their own population? I would argue that there is no deal,\" Misra said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "President Donald Trump sounded optimistic about trade with China hours after more of his tariffs set in. \"We can't allow China to rip us off more,\" he said.", "authors": ["Evie Fordham"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/Trump-Xi-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
