Euro Down to $1.0905 on Big Selling", "language": "en", "text": "Politics is what drives the global market sentiment to the bottom right now.\n\n\n\nIn the US, the drama around Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment went a step further after a whistle-blower, who apparently is a CIA officer, filed a complaint claiming that Trump tried to conceal his conversation with the Ukrainian President, and set the stage for Trump\u2019s impeachment inquiry.\n\n\n\nUS equity futures closed Thursday\u2019s session in the red, as futures edged lower in Asia. The US 10-year yield consolidated a touch below the 1.70% level.\n\n\n\nAcross the Pacific, Hong Kong is boiling. Tomorrow is the fifth anniversary of the 2014 umbrella protests in Hong Kong. It is also the 17th week of the anti-China protests that started as an opposition to the government\u2019s extradition law and gained traction to cover more demands, including sky-high housing prices and income equity. Forthcoming, October 1st is the 70th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party, and the celebrations are expected to add more fuel to the fire over the coming days. Hence, investors continue decreasing their exposure to Hong Kong stocks before the weekly closing bell. Hang Seng is down by 0.30%.\n\n\n\nNews that the US may not extend a waiver to allow companies to do business with the Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies is the cherry on top. There is a certain optimism that US and Chinese officials may seal at least a partial trade deal in October, but the negotiations remain on slippery ground; even China\u2019s commitment to buy big amounts of US farm products may not lead to a comprehensive trade deal.\n\n\n\nThe market\u2019s destiny is at Donald Trump\u2019s fingertips. A single tweet from Donald Trump could send equities rallying, as it could shatter the market sentiment. And Trump\u2019s next move is anybody\u2019s guess.\n\n\n\nShanghai\u2019s Composite trod water, while stocks in Shenzhen gained 1.16%.\n\n\n\nNikkei (-1.24%) and Topix (-1.76%) followed up on US session losses, as the Japanese yen gained on risk-off demand. The consumer price inflation in Tokyo eased more than analysts expected in September, strengthening the case for additional monetary stimulus at the Bank of Japan\u2019s (BoJ) next meeting.\n\n\n\nAustralian stocks ticked higher; however, on prospects of a further rate cut from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) at next week\u2019s monetary policy meeting.\n\n\n\nThe US dollar gained against most G10 currencies. The US dollar index advanced past the 99-handle.\n\n\n\nEuro dives to 1.0905 on large interbank selling\n\n\n\nThe euro shortly dived to 1.0905 on the back of a decent interbank selling ahead of large put option expiry at 1.0900 due September 30. The end-of-month, end-of-quarter purchases in yen versus the euro add additional downside pressure on the single currency. Large put option expiry at 1.10 is expected to maintain a decent downside pressure on the euro before the weekly closing bell. The euro sell-off could accelerate on large-stop orders below the 1.09 mark.\n\n\n\nCheap pound attracts capital to FTSE, utility rally.\n\n\n\nIn the UK, Parliament\u2019s resumption only escalated the political tensions among British lawmakers. There hasn\u2019t been inch progress in Brexit discussions, as the clock ticks louder to the October 17th summit with the European leaders. The best the UK could do is to divert a no-deal Brexit by the October 31st deadline. Despite legislation that outlaws a no-deal Brexit to happen by next month, there is a certain anxiety that Boris Johnson could find loopholes in the legislation to go around the law and deliver a no-deal Brexit anyway \u2013 which would be a real disaster for the pound sterling.\n\n\n\nThe pound feels the pinch of a chaotic Parliament and British MPs\u2019 inability to find an agreement among themselves regarding an utterly complicated divorce from the EU. Cable slipped below the critical 1.2348-support, the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement on September rebound, and stepped in the bearish consolidation zone. The pound sell-off could extend toward the 1.2272 (50% retracement) and 1.2198 (major 61.8% retracement).\n\n\n\nCheaper pound attracts capital to Britain\u2019s blue chips. The negative correlation between the FTSE and the pound rises as the pound slips.\n\n\n\nThe FTSE closed Thursday\u2019s session 0.84% stronger. All sectors gained; utilities rallied 2.37% as Citi turned bullish on British utility stocks and upgraded Centrica, United Utilities and Pennon from neutral to buy pointing at a waning nationalization threat on the falling likelihood of a Labour majority in the likely scenario of a snap election.\n\n\n\nFTSE futures (+0.15%) hint at a positive start in London.\n\n\n\nElsewhere, oil markets are preparing to close the week 5% lower on the back of higher US stockpiles and at a faster-than-expected recovery in Saudi Aramco\u2019s production plants following the recent drone attacks. Middle East tensions are diluted in a pool of political shenanigans, including Trump\u2019s impeachment. As a result, WTI crude eyes a further decline toward the $55 a barrel, as Brent crude could extend losses toward the $60 mark.\n\n\n\nOpening calls\n\n\n\nto open 10 points higher at 7361\n\n\n\nto open flat at 12289\n\nDisclaimer: The information and comments provided herein under no circumstances are to be considered an offer or solicitation to invest and nothing herein should be construed as investment advice.
