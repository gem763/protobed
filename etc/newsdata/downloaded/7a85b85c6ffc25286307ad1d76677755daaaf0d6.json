Last month, when ABC announced that President Trump\u2019s former White House press secretary Sean Spicer was joining the cast, outrage erupted on social media that the falsehood-prone former administration official would have a chance to repair his image on a powerful TV platform.\n\n\u201cThe Internet kind of broke talking about Sean Spicer being on \u2018Dancing With the Stars,\u2019 \u201d Spicer\u2019s professional dance partner, Lindsay Arnold, said in their pre-recorded introduction video. Apparently, Spicer \u2014 who performed a salsa to the Spice Girls hit \u201cSpice Up Your Life\u201d \u2014 was trying to break the Internet again on his first episode, because he showed up wearing this:\n\n\n\nSean Spicer and Lindsay Arnold on \u201cDancing With the Stars.\u201d (Eric McCandless/ABC)\n\n...which led to many Twitter comments like this:\n\nOh Sean Spicer...whichever producer picked that outfit for you DEFINITELY voted for Hillary in 2016. #DWTS \u2014 Mike Shea\ud83c\udf99 (@MikeSheaComedy) September 17, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s our ranking of all 12 pairs from the first night, from best to worst:\n\n[\u2018Dancing With the Stars\u2019 perfected a formula for kitschy, escapist joy. Can it survive today\u2019s politics?]\n\n1) James Van Der Beek and Emma Slater (tango, judge scores: 7, 7, 7 for a total of 21 out of 30 points)\n\nAge: 42\n\nBest known as: Dawson from the hit WB teen drama, \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek.\u201d\n\nStory line: He wants to show his five young children to not be afraid to try new things. Plus, he misses being in front of an audience.\n\nPerformance: He crushed it. \u201cWe have a leading man in the house!\u201d Carrie Ann Inaba shouted, sounding relieved. Although Van Der Beek was the last dancer to perform, most of the others were rough to watch. (Blame first week jitters?) Len Goodman complimented his technique and thought it was terrific, while Bruno Tonioli loved that he was completely in control of the dance the entire way through.\n\n\n\nJames Van Der Beek and Emma Slater (Eric McCandless/ABC)\n\n2) Lauren Alaina and Gleb Savchenko (cha cha, judge scores: 7, 6, 6 for a total of 19 out of 30 points)\n\nAge: 24\n\nBest known as: Country singer and runner-up of \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d Season 10 back in 2011.\n\nStory line: She has been performing music since she was a kid, but has never danced before. Will that be a problem?\n\nPerformance: Alaina impressed the judges with her energy, though Tonioli had criticisms about her footwork. Overall, he thought it was a \u201cpolished\u201d performance: \u201cIt was like watching a sultry Southern belle giving me a steamy cha cha the way I like it,\u201d he growled. Inaba complimented Savchenko\u2019s choreography as \u201cpowerful,\" while Goodman enjoyed her rhythm \u2014 although he thought the introduction was a bit long-winded.\n\n\n\nLauren Alaina an Gleb Savchenko (Eric McCandless/ABC)\n\n3) Sailor Brinkley-Cook and Val Chmerkovskiy (fox trot, judge scores: 6, 6, 6 for a total of 18 out of 30 points)\n\nAge: 21\n\nBest known as: A Sports Illustrated model and daughter of supermodel Christie Brinkley.\n\nStory line: Her mom was originally supposed to be in this cast, but during rehearsals, she fell and broke her arm. So Sailor bravely stepped in to take her place for the rest of the season. Monday afternoon, Wendy Williams accused Brinkley of faking her injury so her daughter could get national TV exposure. When People magazine asked Brinkley about this, the supermodel \u201cburst into tears\u201d and said she was \u201ctotally shocked\u201d by the accusation.\n\nPerformance: Brinkley-Cook scored brownie points right away when she ran to her mom in the audience, cradling a cast; the moment the dance ended, they both started crying. The judges gave her a rave, of course, complimenting her talent and skills with only three days of practice. When Goodman started to offer actual criticism, everyone started yelling at him.\n\n\n\nSailor Brinkley-Cook and Val Chmerkoskiy (Eric McCandless/ABC)\n\n4) Mary Wilson and Brandon Armstrong (fox trot, judge scores: 6, 5, 6 for a total of 17 out of 30 points)\n\nAge: 75\n\nBest known as: Founder of legendary group The Supremes, the first female group at Motown Records.\n\nStory line: She\u2019s the oldest contestant in the competition. HOW will she fare?!\n\nPerformance: Wilson impressed the judges in a way that few other contestants did in Week 1, including Goodman: Even though he\u2019s the same age as Wilson, he said, he wishes he could do a fox trot as well as she did. Tonioli and Inaba were almost too starstruck to speak, though they agreed it was \u201cwell done.\u201d\n\n\n\nMary Wilson and Brandon Armstrong (Eric McCandless/ABC)\n\n5) Hannah Brown and Alan Bersten (cha cha, judge scores: 7, 7, 6 for a total of 20 out of 30 points)\n\nAge: 24\n\nBest known as: Last season\u2019s \u201cBachelorette\u201d star who dumped the \u201cwinner,\u201d Jed, in the finale when she found out he never broke up with his girlfriend before he joined the show.\n\nStory line: \u201cMy heart\u2019s been through a lot,\u201d Brown confessed in her pre-recorded intro, adding that after the madness of the Jed situation, she wants this show to be a \u201cfresh start.\u201d\n\nPerformance: Goodman called this a \u201ccrisp, clean, confident\" dance that actually contained elements of the cha cha, which is basically a rave. Tonioli was a bit more critical, saying she has to work on her balance. Inaba loved her attitude and said that while Bersten was \u201cdragging her around\u201d at the beginning, she recovered nicely.\n\n\n\nHannah Brown and Alan Bersten (Eric McCandless/ABC)\n\n6) Karamo Brown and Jenna Johnson (salsa, judge scores: 6, 5, 6 for a total of 17 out of 30 points)\n\nAge: 38\n\nBest known as: The \u201cculture expert\u201d on Netflix\u2019s hit series \u201cQueer Eye.\u201d\n\nStory line: Brown said he \u201cbegged\" producers to be on the show. Will his persistence pay off? Meanwhile, he ran into trouble last month when he proclaimed that Spicer was a \u201creally sweet guy\u201d and said he believed \u201cif you can talk to someone and meet in the middle, you can learn about each other and help each other both grow.\u201d After backlash, Brown deleted his Twitter account.\n\nPerformance: The judges must have had high hopes for Brown, because although it was a solid dance, they felt let down. \u201cIt was all a bit disappointing, really,\u201d Goodman said by way of kicking things off, adding that Brown\u2019s hip action needed work. Tonioli complimented his style but had the same hip complaint. Inaba also thought that Brown was too reserved and didn\u2019t live up to his potential.\n\n\n\nKaramo Brown and Jenna Johnson (Eric McCandless/ABC)\n\n7) Kel Mitchell and Witney Carson (tango, judge scores: 6, 5, 5 for a total of 16 out of 30 points)\n\nAge: 41\n\nBest known as: The Nickelodeon child star from \u201cAll That,\u201d \u201cKenan & Kel\u201d and \u201cGood Burger.\u201d\n\nStory line: Can the public finally separate him from Kenan Thompson, his most famous co-star?\n\nPerformance: The judges were fairly optimistic about Mitchell\u2019s potential \u2014 they all said some variation of \u201cYou made some mistakes and weren\u2019t great, but it\u2019s only Week 1 and we loved your attitude!\u201d Tonioli seemed especially pleased, and said Mitchell had serious determination.\n\n\n\nKel Mitchell and Witney Carson (Eric McCandless/ABC)\n\n8) Ally Brooke and Sasha Farber (cha cha, judge scores: 5, 5, 6 for a total of 16 out of 30 points)\n\nAge: 26\n\nBest known as: One of the members of pop group Fifth Harmony, which was assembled on \u201cThe X Factor.\u201d\n\nStory line: Like the rest of her former band members, she\u2019s officially a solo artist \u2014 will she set herself apart with the art of dance?\n\nPerformance: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hip thrusting and gyrating,\u201d Goodman said scornfully, and added, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of sort of Beyonc\u00e9 stuff in there, which I\u2019m not a fan of.\u201d (He admitted that Brooke was still a very \u201ccompetent\u201d dancer.) Frankly, we didn\u2019t even hear what Tonioli and Inaba said next, because we were wondering how quickly the Beyhive will come for Goodman.\n\n\n\nAlly Brooke and Sasha Farber (Eric McCandless/ABC)\n\n9) Ray Lewis and Cheryl Burke (salsa, judge scores: 5, 5, 5 for a total of 15 out of 30 points)\n\nAge: 44\n\nBest known as: Two-time Super Bowl champion for the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nStory line: He is clearly eager to re-live his NFL glory days and famed \u201csquirrel\u201d dance.\n\nPerformance: For offering some mediocre scores, the judges gave a lot of compliments. \"You know how to bring your A game,\u201d Inaba gushed, while Tonioli was also thrilled with how he moved. Goodman added that he showed great potential.\n\n\n\nRay Lewis and Cheryl Burke (Eric McCandless/ABC)\n\n10) Kate Flannery and Pasha Pashkov (cha cha, juge scores: 5, 5, 5 for a total of 15 out of 30 points)\n\nAge: 55\n\nBest known as: Meredith the alcoholic Dunder Mifflin employee on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Office.\u201d\n\nStory line: She has barely danced, ever. Will her lack of experience catch up to her?\n\nPerformance: Mediocre! Inaba declared it a \u201cgreat first dance\" as Goodman stayed critical, advising Flannery to straighten her legs during the dances. Tonioli raved, \u201cYou can run my office anytime,\u201d although he had some critiques about Flannery\u2019s movement.\n\n\n\nKate Flannery and Pasha Pashkov (Eric McCandless/ABC)\n\n11) Lamar Odom and Peta Murgatroyd (fox trot, judge scores: 5, 3, 3 a total of 11 out of 30 points)\n\nAge: 38\n\nBest known as: Los Angeles Lakers star and ex-husband of Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian.\n\nStory line: Odom said in his intro that he wants people to know \u201cthe real me\u201d \u2014 likely referring to the fact that he\u2019s also known for his well-documented addiction issues after he nearly died of an overdose in a Las Vegas brothel in 2015.\n\nPerformance: It was rough! The height difference between is Odom (6-foot-10) and Murgatroyd (5-foot-7) was significant, and Goodman thought \u201cit lacked finesse.\u201d Tonioli sympathized that the fox trot is the hardest dance to learn and pointed out lots of mistakes. Inaba, feeling pressure to offer something positive, said she loved that Odom wasn\u2019t afraid to stand up straight and show off his full height.\n\n\n\nLamar Odom and Peta Murgatroyd (Eric McCandless/ABC)\n\n12) Sean Spicer and Lindsay Arnold (salsa, judge scores: 4, 4, 4 for a total of 12 out of 30 points)\n\nAge: 47\n\nBest known as: President Trump\u2019s first press secretary and inspiration for Melissa McCarthy\u2019s Emmy-winning impression on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d\n\nStory line: His casting caused furor with fans and high-profile figures at ABC, given his history at the White House: Berating the media and falsely announcing Trump\u2019s inauguration crowd was the largest ever, calling concentration camps \u201cHolocaust centers,\u201d etc. In his intro, Spicer said people have a \u201cone-dimensional\u201d idea of him and he joined the show because \u201cIt\u2019s been two years since leaving the White House, and I thought it was finally time to enjoy myself.\u201d\n\nPerformance: Arnold bluntly stated that Spicer\u2019s dancing ability is at a \u201cpre pre-school level\u201d and it showed. You know it\u2019s bad when Goodman barely says anything except \u201cI admire your courage coming on this show.\u201d Tonioli and Inaba went with \u201cstrangely entertaining.\u201d \u201cThere were some elements of salsa there,\u201d Tonioli said doubtfully. \u201cNot always on time or on rhythm.\u201d", "description": "Sean Spicer, whose casting caused a furor, wore a neon ruffled shirt that was skewered on social media.
