His mother and members of the public rushed to his aid and medics tried to save his life, but he was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nHussein and Giwa were captured running across a junction on a driver's dashcam and moments later, the callous killer was filmed calmly walking into an Indian restaurant at the end of the street.\n\nWith Jordan's blood still on his trainers, Hussein is seen heading inside Vaibhavam and speaking to a member of staff, but he appears to be turned away.\n\nHussein, who was 18 at the time of the murder, has today been caged following a trial by jury at Birmingham Crown Court .\n\nHe was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life with a minimum term of 19 years.\n\nAs he was escorted down to his cell, Jordan's family and friends hurled abuse at the killer, screaming: \"Ugly, evil murdering c***\" , \"scum\", \"murderer\" and \"ugly b***\".\n\nJudge Melbourne Inman QC said in passing sentence: \"Jordan Moazami was only 18 when he died, he had his life before him. Sadly this is another case where the carrying of knives by young men has escalated violence to murder.\n\n\"This was a Wednesday evening in a residential road. There was a dispute between Giwa and Moazami which was a drugs dispute.\n\n\"It is clear that Mr Moazami pursued you in a car. You were prepared for violence and willing to fight. The knife has never been recovered. It was clearly a formidable knife.\n\n\"You chased and attacked Mr Moazami. You struck at least five blows with a knife. The fatal blow was properly described as brutal. The sentence is fixed by law and is one of custody for life.\n\n\"Although you have a relevant conviction you do not have any previous convictions for serious violence.\n\n\"You come from a good family. You were not the initial aggressor. There is a degree of provocation.\n\n\"You responded to violence. To that extent it was not premeditated.\n\n\"You had gone out that day with a fearsome weapon if violence should occur. I sentence you to custody to life. The appropriate minimum term is 19 years.\"\n\nGiwa, who was on trial for manslaughter, was cleared and discharged on the same day.\n\nJordan\u2019s mother paid tribute to him and thanked the community for their support: \u201cJordan will never be forgotten, he will be remembered through his family, friends and all those whose lives he touched.\n\n\u201cI'd like to thank everybody that helped bring Jordan's killer to justice and thank the local community for their continuing support.\u201d", "description": "Jordan Moazami, 18, was knifed while trying to defend himself from his killer Hamed Hussein during the attack in April", "authors": ["Stephanie Balloo", "Image", "Bpm Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20650972.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BIR_Jordan-Moazami.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
