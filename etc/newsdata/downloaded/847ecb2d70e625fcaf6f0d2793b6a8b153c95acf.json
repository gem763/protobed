At that point, ROKU stock price was about $40. Now trading around $170, Roku stock has a market cap of $17.6 billion. That\u2019s more than Discovery Networks (NASDAQ:DISCA), and more than CBS (NYSE:CBS).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhat\u2019s going on is consumers are shutting down their cable and rushing to embrace streaming, a.k.a, \u201cNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and chill.\u201d Roku\u2019s streaming stick, which is at the heart of its TV offerings, is a gatekeeper to this new world. Buy one, plug it into your WiFi, and you can buy all the entertainment you could ever wish for.\n\nDon\u2019t Look at Numbers\n\nIf you\u2019re the kind of investor who looks at numbers, however, ROKU made no sense even when I first recommended it.\n\nRoku\u2019s most recent earnings report, delivered July 17, showed a loss of $10 million on revenue of $250 million.\n\nIts revenue was up 59% year-over-year. Its active account total jumped 39%. Revenue from advertising and services, which it calls \u201cplatform revenue,\u201d was up a staggering 86%.\n\nStill, why would investors pay 20 times revenue for Roku stock? For the same reason former Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO Steve Ballmer paid $2 billion for the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nRarity.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Clippers are one of two NBA franchises in Los Angeles, the nation\u2019s largest market. ROKU is now the largest streaming stick provider, with 39% of the market. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has 30% of the sector. Mighty Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have been left behind, and the market is maturing rapidly.\n\nA Takeover of Roku Looms\n\nRoku\u2019s strength is based on its independence, but even at its present valuation, ROKU is no position to resist a determined acquirer.\n\nRoku\u2019s success makes Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and Charter (NASDAQ:CHTR) irrelevant to their customers. It has left most of the Cloud Czars in the dust. Investors who buy the shares, at any price, suddenly become a gatekeeper to entertainment for a generation. That\u2019s the argument analysts at Market Realist are selling, comparing Roku directly to Netflix.\n\nThe comparison sounds valid. ROKU is now roughly where Netflix was 4 years ago, just about to make its turn toward international growth. It doesn\u2019t yet break out international numbers, but its ambitions are obvious. ROKU collects data directly from consumers, which drives its choices on what to offer through its own, ad-supported Roku channel.\n\nOn the other hand, streaming is an easy hack. As Roku\u2019s own shareholder letter notes, anyone can easily stream from a game machine like the Microsoft Xbox or the Sony (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation. There are tens of millions of such devices in consumers\u2019 living rooms. Apple, Google and Amazon are all out there, along with Tizen, an open-source project backed by Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).\n\nROKU is not Netflix. It does not have nearly the control over future streaming that Netflix has.\n\nBut it is in a very powerful position. It\u2019s sitting at a poker table with 19 chips, next to players who have hundreds of them, and it has a hand with four aces.\n\nRoku probably has a year or two to cash in its chips, maybe to one of its cable rivals, maybe to Disney (NYSE:DIS), maybe to one of the Cloud Czars. They\u2019re all facing a build-or-buy decision, but when one (or more) decides to spend whatever it takes to take out ROKU, watch out.\n\nToday\u2019s investors are betting that it knows when to cash in.\n\nDana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.
