This could be as simple as an occasional long weekend or temporarily dropping to a four-day week.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to set boundaries for emails and other work-based communication during downtime. This in itself is a powerful act of leadership and should empower others to prioritise their mental health.\n\nPeople who experience burnout often lose contact with their hobbies and the things they love doing outside work. It\u2019s important to spend your downtime reconnecting with the things that bring you joy. This could be as simple as lying in a park or on the beach, reading a book, baking a cake, taking a bush walk or playing golf with friends.\n\nMeditating for as little as five minutes a day can help manage stress. Supplied\n\nDaily relaxation is also crucial. As little as five minutes a day of meditation has been proved to help to manage stress. Springfox\u2019s Global Resilience Report found that daily relaxation practices improve sleep by 25 per cent, so you will also lay the foundations for a better night\u2019s rest.\n\n2. Maintain relationships\n\nHaving someone to talk to or spend time with is an effective way to get your mind off work, and can provide comfort and perspective during tough times. You could try to find people in your circle who have the same hobbies and do these activities together. Or schedule two family dinners a week and stick to them. You\u2019ll be surprised by the deeper connection you can build with family over the dinner table.\n\nWhen you\u2019re burnt out, your mind can easily drift to the things that are making you stressed. To combat this, turn your attention to the other important people in your life, ask lots of questions, and listen intently to their answers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Breathe\n\nBreathing is important for shifting in and out of mindsets and can help us stay present in the moment. I recommend a regular \u201cfive breaths of transition\u201d \u2013 taking five deep breaths that help you calmly adjust from one environment to the next.\n\n4. Move\n\nChronic stress takes a profound toll on physical wellbeing, so staying active is an important part of releasing tension and preventing burnout. You should aim for 30 minutes of activity a day, but as little as five minutes of high-intensity exercise a day can decrease stress and emotional exhaustion.\n\nA pet can provide the motivation needed to keep active. Darrian Traynor\n\nExercise also has a positive effect on other factors, including happiness, health, mental health and even work performance. However, having the willpower to exercise when you\u2019re burnt out can be tough, so consider enlisting support to help you get moving \u2013 a pet, a workout partner or personal trainer can all be great motivators and keep you accountable.\n\n5. Give gratitude\n\nPractising daily gratitude increases happiness and satisfaction, reduces stress and neutralises cynicism \u2013 a key characteristic of burnout. But like any habit, it takes practice. Try taking a leaf from the book of Arianna Huffington, who writes down three things she\u2019s grateful for each day, big or small. Try sharing the things you\u2019re grateful for with family or friends as a way to reinforce gratitude and build connection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Think positive\n\nIdentifying negative thoughts so you can challenge them can help you to see the bigger picture. Spending time with positive people can also shift your outlook.\n\nThe highest performers \u2013 those who put their hands up to manage new and difficult projects, or who hold themselves to the highest standards \u2013 are often the most susceptible to burnout. There\u2019s nothing wrong with pushing yourself, but if you\u2019re going to play hard, make sure you rejuvenate harder.\n\nStuart Taylor is a resilience expert and the CEO of Springfox, a provider of corporate resilience programs in Australia.", "description": "Don't just try to push through when work leaves you stressed and exhausted.
