The administration even asked Corey Lewandowski not to testify to certain matters, even though he\u2019s never been an employee of the executive branch. But these maneuvers required that the people involved be willing, for whatever reason, to honor the White House\u2019s request.\n\nYovanovitch and Sondland, also for whatever reason, have decided they won\u2019t do that. What\u2019s notable is that both of them are still employed by the State Department, which can ask them not to testify, but cannot force them not to.\n\nDavid A. Graham: What happened in Ukraine?\n\nThough she was recalled as ambassador to Ukraine, Yovanovitch is a career Foreign Service officer and remains at the State Department. It\u2019s no surprise she doesn\u2019t feel much reason to honor the president\u2019s wishes: She was recalled after Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani campaigned for her removal; a federal indictment of two Giuliani associates unsealed Thursday also showed how they\u2019d asked former Representative Pete Sessions to write a letter calling for her ouster, after making large political donations. She\u2019s expected to testify to Giuliani\u2019s machinations in Ukraine, including attempting to dig up dirt on the Biden family.\n\nIt\u2019s less clear why, as Sondland\u2019s lawyer said in a statement, \u201cnotwithstanding the State Department\u2019s current direction to not testify, Ambassador Sondland will honor the Committees\u2019 subpoena\u201d and appear on October 17, or whether he might decline to answer certain questions. Sondland was originally scheduled to testify on Wednesday, but did not show. Unlike Yovanovitch, he is a political appointee, given his title after helping raise funds for the Trump campaign. Sondland is a hotelier in Oregon.\n\nSondland\u2019s name appeared in a series of text messages handed over to the House by Kurt Volker, who testified last week, shortly after being fired as an envoy to Ukraine. Those questions showed that American and Ukrainian officials believed that there was a quid pro quo in place, in which Ukraine must investigate the Bidens and an arcane 2016-election conspiracy theory in return for military aid and a meeting with the president. Perhaps Sondland believes his testimony will clear his name, or Trump\u2019s.\n\nDavid A. Graham: The mystery of the Ukraine-call transcript\n\nMotives aside, testimony from Sondland and Yovanovitch, like that of Volker, could influence future witnesses. The House has invited a slew of other current executive-branch employees to testify as well, including William Taylor, now the current top diplomat in Ukraine. In the messages Volker produced, Taylor seemed to be consciously creating a paper record of conversations. \u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d he said in one message. Later, Taylor wrote, \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d Whether these officials testify will help determine whether a dam is breaking or some water has merely spilled over the top.", "description": "Trump\u2019s stonewalling relies on the willingness of others to stay quiet, and Marie Yovanovitch and Gordon Sondland are opting out.", "authors": ["David A.
