Some 85 percent of people responding to a CPJ survey said they believed journalists have become less safe over the past five years and that online harassment was the greatest threat they faced.\n\nRadsch said she was surprised to hear so many journalists who responded to the survey talk about the emotional toll that harassment has taken.\n\n\u201cYou can take pro-active steps to make it harder to become a victim of online harassment,\u201d she said.\n\nJournalists were advised to use a password manager, set up two-factor authentication for accounts and consider using a service that deletes their personal information from the internet. In case of harassment, reporters should get offline, tell their boss or colleagues and not respond to the trolls.\n\nOther advice includes conducting regular searches to see what information appears online about a journalist and their families. Social media platforms should be contacted to delete posts that attack, threaten or use personal information without consent, CPJ said. Journalists were advised to document offensive posts.\n\nOne hindrance to reporters, either real or imagined, is the sense that they should toughen out such attacks or ignore them.\n\nThe CPJ also recommended ways for journalists who work alone in the field to protect themselves.\n\nAs of Wednesday, the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker has documented 28 physical attacks against journalists in 2019 .\n\n\u201cThere is a growing awareness that online harassment is an endemic part of being a journalist, especially any journalists who identifies as female or as any sort of minority,\u201d Radsch said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Concerned about growing threats to safety, the Committee to Protect Journalists on Wednesday issued a series of recommendations for reporters to take to protect themselves from digital harassment.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Bauder"], "top_image": ""}
