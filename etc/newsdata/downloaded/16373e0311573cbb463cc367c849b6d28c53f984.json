I feel really embarrassed,\u201d he told journalists at the end of a two-day summit in Brussels. \u201cBoth countries, they passed their exams; I can\u2019t say this about our member states.\u201d\n\nThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, led opposition to opening membership talks with North Macedonia and Albania, putting him at odds with Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel, who has championed the EU hopes of six Balkan states.\n\nDenmark and the Netherlands also blocked the decision, although were open to considering the two countries separately. Both opposed opening talks with Albania, but suggested North Macedonia could get a green light by passing a law to safeguard the future of an independent public prosecutor.\n\nBalkan states began their long journey to EU membership at a summit in Thessaloniki in 2003 when optimism after the end of the cold war was still high.\n\nNorth Macedonia\u2019s foreign minister, Nikola Dimitrov, suggested the EU was being dishonest. \u201cThe least that the European Union owes the region is to be straightforward with us,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIf there is no more consensus on the European future of the western Balkans, if the promise of Thessaloniki 2003 does not stand, the citizens deserve to know.\u201d\n\nNorth Macedonia had been led to believe the path to EU membership would be opened after it resolved a three-decade-long dispute over its name. The former Yugoslav Republic became North Macedonia in February after a historic agreement with Greece, which had blocked Skopje\u2019s Nato and EU ambitions over the dispute.\n\nAlbania\u2019s prime minister, Edi Rama, said the decision was \u201clinked with an open confrontation within the EU itself\u201d, on its enlargement process. He vowed to continue domestic reforms \u201cnot because Paris, Berlin, Brussels or all of them are asking for it, but because it is needed to turn our country into a European, functional one\u201d, Associated Press in Tirana reported.\n\nEU leaders had promised in June to take \u201ca clear and substantive decision as soon as possible and no later than October 2019\u201d.\n\nShortly before a ministerial decision was due this week, France announced it wanted to reform the EU\u2019s enlargement process. The last-minute decision was greeted with scepticism by EU diplomats supporting enlargement, who suspected a ruse to delay a decision.\n\nThe French government has said it supports the \u201cEuropean perspective\u201d of the western Balkan countries, but argues the current process is not credible.\n\nDemocratic backsliding in Poland and Hungary, fatigue after the Greek eurozone crisis, as well as a widespread view that Romania and Bulgaria were let into the EU too soon, has contributed to doubts about EU expansion in some of the club\u2019s older members.", "description": "Juncker says failure of EU to keep its promises was \u2018major historic mistake\u2019", "authors": ["Jennifer Rankin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09f46922dcd1de8c36ec7afa685553e147a34c7d/0_431_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7ea7163938fdc826f527a8f127bbe035", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
