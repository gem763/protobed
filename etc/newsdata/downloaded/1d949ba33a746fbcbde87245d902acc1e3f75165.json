Yikes.\n\nThe photo in question shows the Monarch sporting a white dress, teamed with some classic pearls, one of her signature brooches and some smart, black court heels. So far, so normal. However, in comparison to many other snaps of the Queen, in this one she appears noticeably more casual than usual, with her hands in her pockets and a big beam on her face.\n\nPhoto credit: Barry Jeffrey More\n\nAngela Kelly, the Queen's dresser and friend, shared the aides' fears in her new memoir, The Other Side of the Coin, and also alluded to the idea that Her Majesty was keen to be shown in a more casual/candid light. To be fair, there are a lot of rules that the royal family have to adhere to (especially these ones while on tour) and given that she's reigned for 63 years, one might imagine that sticking to them all can get tiring.\n\nSpeaking about the Hello! magazine shoot, Angela explains that it was she who suggested that the Queen pose with her hands in her pockets. \u201cThe Queen looked at me in amazement, as I asked whether she knew the potential implications of the photographs. She didn't take long to answer: yes, she would do it and, yes, she was sure.\u201d\n\nWhen discussing those who weren't so keen on the pose, Angel said, \"Their [the Royal Collection's] opinion was that these more candid photographs would bring the monarchy down and therefore they were not suitable for the public eye. Why they thought that, I have no idea.\u201d\n\nWe have no idea either, as we think the Queen looks marvellous in the photos and it's great to see a more relaxed side to her. She recently also made waves for forgoing her crown while giving the Queen's Speech, for an interesting reason.\n\nFollow Jennifer on Twitter and Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "They felt the new pictures of the Queen were \"not suitable for the public eye\"", "authors": ["Jennifer Savin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1fyzl8Qrj1W_4de4ySJTnA--~B/aD0zODQ7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmo_633/e91f060dcd2ee50a27890fca2c7c17d9", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
