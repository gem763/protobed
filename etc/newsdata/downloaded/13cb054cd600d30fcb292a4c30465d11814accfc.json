But only moments later, she let out a huge shriek and appeared to instantly regret her decision (pictured right)\n\nAs the ship starts to descends upwards into the sky, a panicked expression appears on her face and suggests she immediately regrets getting on the ship.\n\nThe girl, who appears to be called Cora, had only been on rides similar to the teacups at Disneyland before stepping on board the viking ride on October 5.\n\nMoments later, she goes quiet and clutches on to the safety bar in front of her and grits her teeth.\n\nHer father (pictured right in the cap) encouraged her to 'scream louder' during the theme park ride\n\nHer mouth forms an O as she looks around looking slightly bewildered, before letting out a high-pitched scream.\n\nHer mother rests her hand on their bench and tells the little girl 'it's alright, it's okay'.\n\nThe father joins in and can be heard encouraging the girl to stay calm as 'everyone's having fun'.\n\nHaving been given the pep-talk from her father, the stress disappears from her face and she looks delighted - and he says 'there you go'.\n\nHe eggs her on by telling her to 'scream a bit louder' as the ship rocks back and forth.\n\nThe little girl's mother (pictured left in a striped jumper) screams 'woo' during the viking ride after telling her 'it's alright, it's okay' when she starts to panic\n\nMeanwhile his daughter's eyes dart around the ship and she continues to experience her roller coaster of emotions.\n\nShe then lets out a scream at the top of her lungs which her father tells her 'good job' seconds later.\n\nThe camera then jumps to the girl's mother and brother who scream 'woo' with thumbs up to the camera.\n\nThe little boy appears at ease before the clip jumps back to the girl who get's asked 'how was it, Cora?' and 'was it awesome?'\n\nShe gets repeatedly asked if the ride was awesome but does not reveal anything as it slows down.\n\nBut much to the surprise of viewers, the father revealed how the family stayed at the park until 11pm because they loved it so much - and even went on other 'big rides'.", "description": "A girl, 3, (pictured) went on her first ever 'big ride' at the Lagoon Amusement Park in Farmington, Utah, on October 5.
