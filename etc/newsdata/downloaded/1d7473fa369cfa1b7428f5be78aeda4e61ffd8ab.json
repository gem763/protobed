But this morning the Today show ran excerpts from the interview. Roberts, who has claimed she was a sex slave for Epstein starting when she was a teenager, describes how she was given to Prince Andrew for sex on three occasions, the first when she was just seventeen.\n\n\u201cThe first time in London I was so young,\u201d Giuffre tells Dateline. \u201cGhislaine woke me up in the morning and said you\u2019re going to meet a prince today.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know at that point I was going to be trafficked to that prince.\u201d Giuffre says that night she went to a London hotspot with Maxwell, Epstein and Andrew, where the prince gave her vodka and said, \u201cLet\u2019s dance together.\u201d She says that at the end of the night, Maxwell told her Andrew was coming back with them back to Maxwell\u2019s place. \u201cGhislaine said he\u2019s coming back to the house and I want you do to for him what you do for Epstein,\u201d she says in the interview. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d Giuffre says the encounter took place first in the bathroom and then the bedroom. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t rude or anything about it, but he said thank you \u2013 some kind of soft sentiment like that \u2013 and left.\n\nRoberts claims she had sex with the Prince two more times, once in New York and once on Epstein\u2019s private island. Andrew has repeatedly denied any sexual contact with Roberts. Last month, Buckingham Palace claimed Andrew was \u201cappalled\u201d by Epstein\u2019s crimes. That statement was released a day after the Daily Mail published a video showing Prince Andrew waving goodbye to a young woman at Epstein\u2019s New York mansion in 2010. That was well after Epstein\u2019s Florida conviction and after he\u2019d been forced to register as a sex offender.\n\nWhen NBC asked Roberts about Prince Andrew\u2019s denials she replied, \u201cHe denies that it ever happened and he\u2019s going to keep denying that it ever happened but he knows the truth and I know the truth.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the portion of the interview featured on the Today show this morning. As you\u2019ll see, Roberts offers a lot of detail including the name of the club, the section where they sat, the type of drink Andrew gave her, etc. When combined with the photo of her and Andrew (above) it makes a pretty compelling case.", "description": "\"...he knows the truth and I know the truth.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Prince-Andrew.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
