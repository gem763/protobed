Andrew Yang Says Yea", "language": "en", "text": "Bitcoin News Bitcoin for Monthly $1K Payouts? Andrew Yang Says Yea\n\nFree Bitcoin payouts could become reality under a US presidency if 2020 candidate Andrew Yang is elected, he has hinted in fresh comments.\n\nUniversal Bitcoin Income?\n\nSpeaking during an interview on the Off the Pill Podcast on September 15, Yang, who is well known as a cryptocurrency supporter, shed new light on his Bitcoin plans.\n\nOne of the few hopefuls to accept cryptocurrency for his presidential campaign, Yang has also said he wants to issue a monthly salary to US residents.\n\nDubbed Universal Basic Income (UBI) or the Freedom Dividend, the payment of $1000 would apply to everyone, regardless of status.\n\nNow, Yang has suggested those payouts could come in the form of Bitcoin 00 rather than US dollars.\n\nWhen asked whether he had considered Bitcoin as the medium for applying UBI, Yang appeared to say yes. He also reacted positively to a suggestion that Bitcoin\u2019s divisibility into satoshis made it the ideal candidate.\n\n\u201cI love where you\u2019re headed,\u201d he replied to the interviewer.\n\n\u201c\u2026That\u2019s one reason why everyone in the cryptocurrency community loves the idea of Universal Basic Income or the Freedom Dividend.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Freedom Vs. Ban\n\nYang\u2019s comments came as sentiment remains sketchy over the attitudes to the current US administration regarding crypto.\n\nAs Bitcoinist reported, some proponents already believe that should its value increase, Bitcoin would face a ban in the US under current political conditions.\n\nWhile it remains unknown how such a ban would be applied, a wider global clampdown on the freedom to use crypto is already gathering pace.\n\nBy June 2020, more than 200 countries will likely implement identity requirements from the intergovernmental body, Financial Action Task Force (FATF).\n\nThese require the sender and recipient of any transaction over $1000 to identify themselves to an exchange or any other business facilitating it. Similar to a ban, critics have argued such a measure would, in reality, be impossible to administer.\n\nNonetheless, last week the South Korean branch of exchange OKEx announced it was halting trading of five privacy-focused altcoins explicitly due to the FATF\u2019s requirements.\n\nYang meanwhile is not the only party thinking of leveraging financial freedom in a US election. Last month, Casa CTO Jameson Lopp said he was considering running based solely on advocating Bitcoin and giving it legislative freedom.\n\n\u201cThinking about running for POTUS on a single-issue platform: if elected I\u2019ll give every citizen $1,000 in Bitcoin a month,\u201d he wrote on Twitter echoing Yang\u2019s UBI.\n\n\u201cThis is doable because we\u2019ll never run out of dollars and the economics will benefit America in the long run since we\u2019ll end up with the most BTC.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think about Andrew Yang\u2019s stance on Bitcoin?
