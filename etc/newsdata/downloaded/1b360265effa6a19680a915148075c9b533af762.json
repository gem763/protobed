She was given the opportunity to dispute the charges before her termination was considered but never did so.\n\nThe incident is not the only time students reportedly felt uncomfortable by Ms. Krom\u2019s use of religion in her classroom, The Tribune reported.\n\nMultiple students claimed Ms. Krom brought a box of donated Bibles into class and made them available for her students to take.\n\nArizona law prohibits conducting \u201cany religious exercises in school\u201d and is punishable with the revocation of a teacher\u2019s certification.\n\nAnother student alleges the teacher gave them a Bible when they shared their pro-choice abortion beliefs and claimed Ms. Krom lowered an assignment grade with little explanation after they told her they were atheist or agnostic.\n\n\u201cStudent reasonably believes the change in her grading was the result of discrimination by teacher,\u201d the district\u2019s report states.\n\nMs. Krom told The Tribune to speak to her attorney, but he didn\u2019t respond to messages.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
