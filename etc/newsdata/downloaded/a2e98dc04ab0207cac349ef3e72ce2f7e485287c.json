Delta, for one, says the bank\u2019s financing gives rivals such as Emirates Airline, Thai Airways International PLC and Air India an advantage in their aircraft purchases that isn\u2019t available to U.S. carriers. For some foreign airlines, Ex-Im Bank\u2019s financing can be less expensive than a standard commercial loan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s what regulatory capture looks like:\n\nIt\u2019s amid such criticisms that the Ex-Im Bank and Boeing collaboration began. In August 2012, a bank official forwarded a draft proposal on the economic-impact trigger to several senior executives at Boeing and its aircraft-financing unit. \u201cPlease note that this is an internal Ex-Im document still in draft form, but we wanted to get your input on several aspects of it prior to further developing the paper,\u201d wrote Claire Avett, an Ex-Im policy analyst on Friday, Aug. 31. \u201cWe look forward to working closely with you to define concrete next steps to be able to achieve these ends,\u201d she wrote, referring to imminent internal deadlines. \u201cSubjecting and applying other transactions to detailed analysis under economic impact procedures has had the effect of killing most of those deals,\u201d wrote Mr. Morin, in the Sept. 1 email. \u201cAccordingly, it is very important that we establish the correct procedures here,\u201d he said \u2026 The next month, the partners delved into nitty-gritty details, including the time frame that would be used to assess economic impact (shortening the time period to 12 months might be best, one Boeing official suggested). They settled on 12 months \u2026 In one email where the two sides discussed who should conduct the analysis, Ms. Avett, the Ex-Im Bank policy analyst, asks for input on \u201cwhat would be most palatable to Boeing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is something really messed up about the whole thing. Sure, forty percent of all Ex-Im activitives benefit Boeing, but if rules are being drafted to make sure Ex-Im isn\u2019t unfair to other companies, why is Boeing getting such prominent input? The federal government already has a way to get input from industry about new rules that may affect them \u2014 it\u2019s called the public-comment period, which takes place at regulatory agencies for all to see. Not with Ex-Im.\n\nIt reminds me of the revelations last fall that the regulators at the Federal Reserve in New York were cozying up with one of the nation\u2019s biggest financial institutions it was supposed to oversee. That\u2019s a real problem.\n\nOf course, this isn\u2019t the example of Ex-Im\u2019s trouble with transparency. The data it provides to the public (when it is available) about its activities is messy, incomplete, and not user-friendly. It has even made access to the data even worse in the last month. It suffers from fraud and abuse. Some of its employees are under investigation for taking bribes and kickbacks from beneficiaries. It\u2019s not been at all responsive to recent reforms demanded by Congress..\n\nLawmakers have a chance to make things right with the public and with the millions of unseen victims of the Ex-Im Bank: Come June, they can just do nothing and let its charter expire. The easy, clean, and free-market solution!", "description": "The Wall Street Journal has a incredible piece today (thanks to Scott Lincicome for the pointer) showing the power of regulatory capture \u2014 and the sheer dominance of Boeing over the Export-Important Bank.\n\nThe reporter, Brody Mullins, draws on ...", "authors": ["Veronique De Rugy", "Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
