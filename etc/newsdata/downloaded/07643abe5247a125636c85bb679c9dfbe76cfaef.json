Many people were confused as to how he was getting skid marks on her sheets\n\nMystery: The woman explained that her boyfriend sleeps nude, and the stains are always on his side of the bed when he sleeps over\n\n'To sum it up: he leaves skidmarks in my bed when we are together. Sometimes they're not...dry,' she added. 'I find them after he leaves and because I have light sheets it's kind of obvious.'\n\nThe woman said when it first happened, she was 'incredibly embarrassed' and assumed she was the one who had done it, even though it seemed unlikely.\n\n'I shower two times a day and take care of my areas!' she noted.\n\nShe admitted it has happened a couple of times in their relationship, but she hasn't been ready to say anything until now.\n\n'Today was the last straw, because I accidentally touched it and it was wet and it was exactly where HE was laying and it took every ounce of self control to not gag because he was getting ready to leave,' she said. 'I really need to talk to him about this and I don't want him to feel bad.'\n\nJust saying: People had a lot of thoughts, but most of them were in agreement that a 29-year-old man should be able to wipe himself properly without being told\n\nThe woman explained that her boyfriend doesn't wear anything to sleep, not even boxers, and she is sick of having to 'scope out' her sheets every time he is in her bed.\n\n'Frankly, it's also just gross,' she added. 'I hate saying it but it's true, he's a grown man and I can't believe that it's fallen on me to explain this to him. He always mentions how much he likes baby wipes in the bathroom for this purpose, but...my bed says otherwise.\n\n'He's diligent about every other aspect of grooming that I've been able to notice, so to have this be something going on is kind of odd. I love him to death but I'm tired of cleaning my sheets and praying the stains come out. How can I talk to him about it without making him feel bad?' she asked at the end of her post.\n\nPeople had a lot of thoughts, but most of them were in agreement that a 29-year-old man should be able to wipe himself properly without being told.\n\n'He should know how to wipe his a** at 29. No gentle. He needs tough love,' one person wrote.\n\n'Ask your boyfriend, \"Boyfriend, how do you know when you're done wiping?\" And gauge his answer. If the answer is, \"I wipe until there's no brown on the toilet paper anymore\" he's got a problem with defecation during coitus,' someone else commented. 'If he starts to sweat, clams up, says, \"uhh... uhh...\" you know you caught him brown handed.'\n\nOthers were just confused as to how he was getting skid marks on her sheets.\n\nCall the doctor: A few people who work in the medical field were concerned it was the sign of a physical ailment and not a hygiene issue\n\n'Can someone explain how this is even happening? Is he parting his cheeks and pressing down on the bed?' one Reddit user asked. 'Is he taking really horrible poops that get on the outside of his a**? Or is he sharting in the bed? I can't imagine what this guy's underwear and pants look like.'\n\n'If I knew, I'd explain it. I know it is s**t,' the woman responded. 'I don't know how it's getting there, and it's absolutely coming from him because it's only on his sides of the bed and it ONLY happens when he's there. My sheets are admittedly a bit loose on my bed, maybe there's some kind of issue where they are getting bunched up?'\n\nA few people who work in the medical field were concerned it was the sign of a physical ailment and not a hygiene issue.\n\nOne nurse pointed out that if the skid mark is wet, it is still fresh.\n\n'Either he has constantly really loose stool, like leaking diarrhea OR he has a sphincter problem. That means there's an issue with the muscles of his anus,' the person explained, adding: 'I strongly suggest he sees a doctor.'\n\n'It may not be simply a matter of wiping,' someone else agreed. 'If he has IBS or other bowel troubles, he could very well be cleaning himself just fine after using the toilet, but later soiling himself (and your sheets) via leakage or wet farting.'\n\nThe woman later added an edit to her post, sharing that she planned on speaking with her boyfriend in person that Friday.\n\nAfter reading all the comments, she now thinks it may be a health problem like some have suggested. She also stressed that her boyfriend doesn't smell like feces.\n\n'I'm telling you, I have no warning this is going to occur!' she said. 'He just smells like vaguely sweaty depending on the time of day. Do I go digging around his a**hole looking for crumbs? No. I don't plan to. I don't actively come across chances to point out his butthole, unfortunately.'", "description": "A 24-year-old woman took Reddit to ask advice on how she can\u00a0'gently explain' to her 29-year-old boyfriend 'that he isn't wiping himself properly.'", "authors": ["Erica Tempesta For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/23/20352612-0-image-a-103_1572392453215.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
