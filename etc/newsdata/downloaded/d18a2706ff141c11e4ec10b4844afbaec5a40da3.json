Here Are 15 Quotes To Guide You", "language": "en", "text": "Every day we are faced with tough situations that can make us react differently \u2014 some people might be sad, others might be upset, and then there are others who can grow angry and violent. And even though feeling these intense emotions is perfectly normal (after all, we are human), you shouldn\u2019t cling to them for a long time and hold grudges because it goes against God\u2019s wishes.\n\nIn the Bible, God advises us to let go of our anger as soon as possible because it\u2019s this intense anger that can lead us to sin. If you\u2019re someone who is prone to reacting angrily, read these Bible verses about anger to remind you that this anger can only lead to trouble and cause issues. They will also remind you to be careful when surrounding yourself with people who have a short temper because they can easily drag you into their problems or pick a fight with you.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hjmoIxBcCZ0zewcQOUcR1g--~B/aD0xNDE0O3c9MjEyMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/woman_s_day_132/2b4bd6e4ecb4a14ab5062fd38a3e60eb", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
