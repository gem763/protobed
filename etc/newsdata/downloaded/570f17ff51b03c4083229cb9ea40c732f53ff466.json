A team of scientists from the Israel Institute of Technology and Brazil's Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics discovered that the speed of light can be manipulated to come to a halt. To do it, they tuned two different modes of light to combine into one mode, or 'coalesce'. When two modes of light coalesce, they reach something that is called an 'exceptional point'. At an exceptional point, the speed of light reaches a standstill. The research could help scientists with other 'slow-light applications' such as telecommunications. Previously, the only way to control the speed of light to was to release a swarm of 'ultracold' sodium atoms or trap it in 'photonic-crystal' waveguides.\n\nO\u2019Donoghue\u2019s third speed-of-light animation brings to life the frustrations NASA endures when contacting and gathering information from the InSight on Mars.\n\nWhen the American space agency attempts to communicate or download details of the red planet from the rover, it can only be done at the speed of light.\n\nAnd as the previous animation revealed, light speed becomes much slower as we travel farther away.\n\nIn order to do everything in \u2018live mode\u2019, scientists must strategically plan out what is needed and an exact location they need to probe in order to not miss their target.\n\nThe total distance between Earth and Mars is about 158 million, however, there is an event that happens every two years where the planets are position closer, making the distance only 33.9 million miles.\n\nDuring this even, time decreases to three minutes and two seconds to travel one-way and six minutes and four seconds for a round-trip, which is the example O\u2019Donoghue uses in the animation.\n\nAnd the farther scientists travel into deep space, the longer it takes.\n\nWhen looking at Proxima b, which is about 4.2 light-years away from Earth, it would take at least 13,211 years for a solar probe traveling at the speed of light to reach the exoplanet.", "description": "A JAXA scientist has painted a picture of the unfathomable - the speed of light.
