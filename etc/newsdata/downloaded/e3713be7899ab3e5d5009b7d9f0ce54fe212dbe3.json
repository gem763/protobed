It\u2019s Late Summer. What Now?", "language": "en", "text": "EDINBURGH \u2014 The window overlooks a neglected backyard where a few shrubs grow with their backs to the wall. Under the washing lines, grasses heavy with seed pods all incline slightly southward, and among the grasses a lone yellow plant, maybe a ragwort.\n\nIt\u2019s evening. From time to time the grasses move in the breeze. Now a feather comes wafting down, a pigeon or a herring gull\u2019s. It\u2019s cloud-gray, as though plucked from a cloud.\n\nA century-old backyard, walled in on three sides by tenements four stories high and stacked with other folks\u2019 windows, other folks\u2019 lives, their ages and stages, their phone wires and drainpipes, slate roofs and all the disused chimneys above the roofs near silhouetted against a sky that\u2019s glowing white between grayish clouds. The opalescent northern sky: It is late summer.\n\nYou\u2019re watching the grasses move, and the way the telephone cables serving the apartments radiate from a common pole, planted out there in the back green, and how the wires divide the air into segments. You\u2019re watching the chimneys darken and that cool sky as it intensifies in the last light, a cold glow. Just looking out the window. That near-white sky. Hadn\u2019t you seen the same shine and tone earlier in the day? Yes, it was the pendant your daughter was wearing, an oval stone set in a silver rim, on a silver chain, the stone just the size of a thumbnail. A pendant she often wore, cool and calm, that changed in the light between cream and pale gray.", "description": "The evening is your own.", "authors": ["Kathleen Jamie"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/15/opinion/15jamie/15jamie-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
