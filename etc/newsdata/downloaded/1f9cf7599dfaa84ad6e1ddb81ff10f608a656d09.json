The crimes he committed in that call were serious, and merit the ultimate sanction that can be imposed on a sitting president, namely removal from office. And yet even since that conversation took place, in fact this very week, Trump has had another call that included an act that may not meet the constitutional standard of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanours\u201d and for which he will face no such punishment \u2013 but whose consequences will surely be even graver. For they will be measured in life and death.\n\nExpect more policy lurches like on Syria's Kurds unless Trump is called to account | Michael H Fuchs Read more\n\nThe first of these two fateful calls was, of course, with the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, featuring a request that he dig for dirt on Trump\u2019s would-be Democratic opponent, Joe Biden. Even if that demand did not form one half of a clear quid pro quo, in which US military aid and future arms sales to Kyiv would be contingent on compliance \u2013 though the grammar of the phone call very much suggests it did \u2013 it is still an impeachable offence. The soliciting of foreign interference in US elections has been forbidden since the birth of the republic. It was one of the menaces against which the framers of the constitution were most determined to protect their infant nation.\n\nThe second call was Sunday\u2019s conversation with the president of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. This time it was Trump from whom a \u201cfavour\u201d was sought. Erdo\u011fan urged Trump to remove a small contingent of US troops from along the Turkish-Syrian border, where they had acted as a kind of tripwire, preventing Turkey from attacking its longtime enemy, the Kurds, in northeastern Syria. Trump agreed, and within hours Turkey was unleashing its full might on the Kurds, the same Kurds who\u2019d believed they were brothers in arms with the Americans in their shared war against Islamic State in Syria. Yes, the losses had been lopsided in that struggle. More than 11,000 Kurds had been killed, while US combat deaths in Syria numbered six. But now their US brothers had abandoned them to their fate.\n\nCurrent US political chatter is much more about Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukraine than it is about his betrayal of the Kurds, and you can see why. The latest twist in the Ukraine scandal, featuring Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Guiliani, and a couple of characters who ran an outfit called Fraud Guarantee, is compelling: Goodfellas with Russian subtitles. And yet it is the Syria decision that will cost lives, including in ways that may not be instantly obvious.\n\nThe most immediate impact will be on those Kurdish forces who, under previous US-Turkish agreements, were only ever lightly armed and who had removed what fortifications they had built along the border. With no air force, no surface-to-air missiles, no armoured personnel carriers, they are massively outnumbered and outgunned by Turkey. Many of them will die. What\u2019s more, Erdo\u011fan has made no secret of his plan to move vast numbers of Arab refugees who had fled from Syria into Turkey over the border. Ankara will call it \u201cresettlement\u201d, and it might look reasonable: repatriating Syrians to Syria. Except these areas are Kurdish. The result, says Carne Ross, the former Foreign Office official whose Independent Diplomat group now advises the Kurds of northeastern Syria, is inevitable: \u201cIt\u2019s ethnic cleansing.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The deserted Tal Arqam base after the withdrawal of US forces, Ras al-Ein, north Syria, 7 October 2019.

One of the tasks that had fallen to the Kurds was the imprisoning of former Isis fighters, preventing them returning to combat. Now the Kurds\u2019 limited resources will be too stretched: they can\u2019t both defend themselves from the Turks and act as jailers for a group of Isis fighters, their families and followers that together number 70,000. This is why, says Ross, \u201cIsis prisoners are jubilant \u2013 jubilant \u2013 at the Turkish invasion,\u201d seeing it as the harbinger of their liberation.\n\nWhen asked if all these Isis men might now escape and pose a threat elsewhere, Trump\u2019s response was telling. \u201cWell, they\u2019re going to be escaping to Europe. That\u2019s where they want to go.\u201d Meaning if, thanks to me, Isis terrorists are now free to shoot people in Paris or blow up buses in London, that\u2019s not my problem.\n\nThe US withdrawal from northern Syria creates the perfect conditions for war crimes | Simon Tisdall Read more\n\nIn other words, you can make a good case that the Erdo\u011fan call will have a more lethal impact than the Zelenskiy one, even if it is the latter for which Trump will be held to account. But the two conversations have much in common.\n\nFirst, they both reveal the readiness of this president to act alone and against all advice, ignoring his military top brass, national security team and Congress. On Ukraine, his own appointees and Republican allies on Capitol Hill were clear that aid to Kyiv was in the US strategic interest. No matter. Trump was ready to withhold $400m in aid if that\u2019s what it took to coerce Zelenskiy into helping his re-election campaign. Similarly, even Trump\u2019s most ardent cheerleaders agreed that the Kurds were allies whose loyalty should be rewarded and that a green light to a Turkish invasion would be unforgivable treachery. No matter, he did it anyway. In both Ukraine and Syria, Trump was ready to jettison long-established US policy to serve his own interests \u2013 keeping everyone else in the dark until it was too late.\n\nIn Ukraine, his personal motive is clear enough. In Turkey, less so \u2013 though it is not irrelevant that there are two \u201cmajor, major\u201d Trump Towers in Istanbul, giving Trump what he himself once called \u201ca little conflict of interest\u201d when it comes to that country. We have surely seen enough by now to know that when Trump hears a request from an authoritarian leader, especially one who could have business leverage over him, he likes to say yes.\n\nThe flipside is his casual disregard for America\u2019s allies. Ukraine is loyal, but was threatened with being starved of cash unless it agreed to act as Trump\u2019s covert opposition research unit. The Kurds have fought valiantly, but Trump brushed them off, saying bizarrely that \u201cthey didn\u2019t help us with Normandy\u201d. He approaches all alliances as mere transactions, tweeting that: \u201cThe Kurds fought with us, but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so.\u201d As one observer put it, for Trump the Kurds weren\u2019t allies \u2013 they were subcontractors. And note the contempt for Europe in both cases. His call with Zelenskiy was full of disdain for the EU; now we know he doesn\u2019t mind Isis terrorists murdering and maiming \u2013 so long as they only murder and maim Europeans.\n\nThere\u2019s a last connection, too. For who benefits from a Ukraine deprived of cash and military equipment? Why, it\u2019s the same person who benefits from a US pullback from Syria: Trump\u2019s old friend, Vladimir Putin.\n\nTrump\u2019s conduct in these two very different situations \u2013 a deliberate political strategy in Ukraine, an apparent whim in Syria \u2013 has one common result, namely the further destruction of America\u2019s reputation in the eyes of its allies. It shows that Donald Trump is not just corroding vital democratic norms and conventions in the US. He is also endangering human lives far away from America\u2019s shores. It is not just the US that needs to see him removed from office and soon \u2013 it is the whole world.\n\n\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist", "description": "The US president\u2019s transactional approach to the world around him poses a grave threat, says Guardian columnist Jonathan Freedland", "authors": ["Jonathan Freedland"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7a5cd8545ee00105864ad862758e127fc91fdde/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c47d83a0def5d19a50567fcc7238085a", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
