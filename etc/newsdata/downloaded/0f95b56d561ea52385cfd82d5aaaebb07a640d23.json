New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services/Handout via REUTERS\n\nU.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra in West Palm Beach also rejected the women\u2019s bid to void the non-prosecution agreement, which had barred prosecutions of Epstein and some alleged accomplices, saying Epstein\u2019s death last month made the issue moot. Marra also denied a request for attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\nBrad Edwards, a lawyer for the accusers, said they may appeal.\n\nMarra ruled seven months after finding that prosecutors had violated the federal Crime Victims\u2019 Rights Act by not telling Epstein\u2019s accusers they had agreed not to pursue serious charges against the financier, in exchange for Epstein\u2019s 2008 guilty plea to Florida state prostitution charges.\n\nEpstein was sentenced to 13 months in jail, but allowed to leave regularly to go to his office.\n\nThe non-prosecution agreement was negotiated by the office of then-U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta, who resigned in July as U.S. labor secretary as Epstein\u2019s agreement drew fresh scrutiny.\n\nEpstein, 66, committed suicide on Aug. 10 by hanging himself in his Manhattan jail cell.\n\nHe had pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking involving dozens of underage girls as young as 14, including at his mansion on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side.\n\nFederal prosecutors in Manhattan had said they were not bound by the Florida non-prosecution agreement.\n\nMarra had invited two Epstein accusers to propose remedies for not being told about the non-prosecution agreement.\n\n\u201cDespite petitioners having demonstrated the Government violated their rights under the CVRA, in the end they are not receiving much, if any, of the relief they sought,\u201d Marra wrote.\n\n\u201cThey may take solace, however, in the fact that this litigation has brought national attention to the Crime Victims\u2019 Rights Act and the importance of victims in the criminal justice system,\u201d he added.\n\nEdwards said in a statement that his clients \u201cshould not be sad, but instead proud\u201d for pursuing the case.\n\n\u201cThis is not the ending we had hoped for, but the enormous progression of victims\u2019 rights through this case will ensure that violations like this never happen again in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cFor that, the fight was worth it.\u201d\n\nThe case was Jane Doe 1 et al v U.S., U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida, No. 08-80736.", "description": "A group of women who said Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused them are not entitled to money damages from the United States even though federal prosecutors kept them in the dark about the financier's lenient non-prosecution agreement more than a decade ago, a Florida judge ruled on Monday.", "authors": ["Jonathan Stempel", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430562663&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F1H9", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
