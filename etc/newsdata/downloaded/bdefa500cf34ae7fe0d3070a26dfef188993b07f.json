Meanwhile another male member of the wedding party begins to put the bride's seatbelt on.\n\nHowever, before he can safely strap the bride into her seat, the driver and the man have a short conversation seemingly about the seatbelt. Following this chat, the man decides to fatefully forgo the bride's seatbelt and leaves her unstrapped in the front passenger seat.\n\nThe bride sits in the rally car, smiling on her big day as a male fiddles with her safety belt but does not secure it\n\nThe wedding party member closes the car door and the bride makes a happy face for the camera before the vehicle starts driving off.\n\nThe bride can be seen waving her hand out of the window\n\nAs the rally car heads off, a wedding party member encourages the driver to 'Get em there lad! Plug it!'.\n\nThe bride cheerfully waves goodbye to the camera as the driver speeds off and spins around a grass verge in racing rally car style.\n\nThe acceleration however causes the driver to completely lose control of the rally car and the vehicle forcefully crashes straight into a lamppost by a brick wall.\n\nThe clip cuts to an end as the wedding party is heard gasping in complete disbelief as the car smashes straight into the brick wall with huge force.\n\nA spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: 'Police received reports that a car left the road near Croft Spa hotel, Croft-on-Tees, at around 6.30pm on 29 June.\n\nThe wedding party is heard gasping as it crashes, the bride was taken to hospital with injuries\n\n'One woman who was a passenger in the vehicle was taken to hospital with injuries.'\n\nIt is unclear how the driver was related to her or if the bride was on her way to the wedding service or the reception.\n\nIt is unknown who filmed the clip however the footage has been circulating on social media since last week.", "description": "In the video, filmed in Darlington, County Durham, the driver crashes the Ford rally car straight into a brick wall as the unidentified bride sits in the front passenger seat - without her seatbelt on.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/16/19302268-0-image-a-32_1570202923594.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
