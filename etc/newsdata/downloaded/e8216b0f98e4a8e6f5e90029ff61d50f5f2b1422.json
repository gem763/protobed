A week before the screening, Our Oceans won the award for Best Feature Film at the Ireland Film Festival.\n\n\u201cThe screening of Our Oceans: Shark Sanctuary at Jackson Wild last week was a resounding success,\u201d said Lauren van Nijkerk of WILDOCEANS. \u201cThere weren\u2019t enough chairs to seat everyone that arrived to view it and the room was overflowing with ocean lovers.\u201d\n\nThe audience especially loved the youth involved in protecting their marine heritage, and had many questions around marine protected areas in South African waters and its growth.\n\nPICS: SA freediver breaks yet another record with this 47m dive to save our oceans\n\nThe public South African premiere will take place on 5 October at the Jozi Film Festival.

Besides the films, they also host summits and talks around conservation to help further the various movements through media.\n\n\u201cJackson Wild is special,\u201d commented WILDTRUST CEO Andrew Venter.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that it is driving a fundamental shift in the way that environmental filmmakers conceptualise and deliver their projects. Given the unprecedented rate of environmental and social change that we are experiencing, the drive towards impact film making is directly relevant.\n\n\"I have no doubt that Jackson Wild\u2019s legacy in this regard will be felt for generations to come, as they direct the most talented environmental filmmakers on the planet towards this outcome.\u201d\n\nAnother special South African also attended the film festival as a presenter - Beverly Joubert - who is an accomplished filmmaker, her most recent work completed in the wilds of the Okavango Delta.\n\nWATCH: Dereck and Beverly Joubert share 'deep life parallels' in the making of Okavango, River of Dreams\n\nThe Theatrical Award went to Sea of Shadows, an investigative piece about the Mexican Navy's fight for the world's smallest whale, while The River and the Wall and Our Gorongosa shared the Special Jury Award - the first is an adventure film following five friends travelling the Texas borderlands and the second follows the rejuvenation of a Mozambican national park with community involvement.\n\nThe Grand Teton Award went to The Biggest Little Farm - a city couple decided to take on farm life and developed a sustainable biodiverse design for living in harmony with nature.\n\nWATCH: Why the ocean is still so unexplored\n\n*Compiled by Gabi Zietsman\n\nFind Your Escape by signing-up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
