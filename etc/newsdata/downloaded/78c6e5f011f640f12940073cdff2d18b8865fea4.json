He said the education system and the curriculum was not the problem at underperforming schools. Instead, he said, it was the quality of support pupils received.\n\nUnderperforming schools failed to finish tasks within the allocated teaching time.\n\n\u201cWe need to have pupils and teachers in school rather than going to class when they please. If teachers take their jobs seriously, are prepared and are in class on time \u2013 and not there to discuss soccer \u2013 pupils will take them seriously because they know they will gain something from their teachers,\u201d he said.\n\nSchool principals should take responsibility for what happened in their schools, because a school was only as good as its principal and teachers.\n\nPupils, he said, took their cue from their teachers, who in turn took theirs from their principals.\n\nDuring his teaching days at Rearabetswe Senior Secondary School in Odendaalsrus, Free State, he said he would get to his classes on time \u2013 and so would his pupils.\n\nAn accomplished administrator, Rakometsi (56) went on to become a university lecturer and later the superintendent-general of the Free State education department.\n\nHe said teachers who failed to arrive for classes and who didn\u2019t prepare their lessons were jeopardising the country\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cWhen teaching children [well], you show that you are patriotic; you care about the country. Pupils give you their time. I care about the future of this country. When you aren\u2019t patriotic, you don\u2019t care,\u201d he said, adding that there were some teachers who put their unions ahead of their jobs.", "description": "The chief executive of the country\u2019s Grade 12 examinations quality assurance body has dismissed criticism of the quality of our matric certificate, saying the National Senior Certificate (NSC) is the envy of neighbouring countries.", "authors": ["Msindisi Fengu"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8351/9cb62d67077a45a5bba56ae27995f7c5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-08"}
