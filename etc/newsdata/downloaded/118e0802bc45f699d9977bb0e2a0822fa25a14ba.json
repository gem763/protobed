When hundreds of millions of fans are furious over an issue, the league, and anyone associated with the NBA, will have to pay attention. As a Governor of one of the 30 NBA teams, and a Chinese having spent a good part of my professional life in China, I need to speak up.\n\nWhat is the problem with people freely expressing their opinion? This freedom is an inherent American value and the NBA has been very progressive in allowing players and other constituents a platform to speak out on issues.\n\nThe problem is, there are certain topics that are third-rail issues in certain countries, societies and communities.\n\nSupporting a separatist movement in a Chinese territory is one of those third-rail issues, not only for the Chinese government, but also for all citizens in China.\n\nThe one thing that is terribly misunderstood, and often ignored, by the western press and those critical of China is that 1.4 billion Chinese citizens stand united when it comes to the territorial integrity of China and the country\u2019s sovereignty over her homeland. This issue is non-negotiable.", "description": "", "authors": ["Joe Tsai", "Facebook.Com Posts"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
