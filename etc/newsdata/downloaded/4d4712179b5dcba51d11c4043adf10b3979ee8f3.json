Roberts Jr., presiding over the historic proceedings from the dais in the upper chamber.\n\nMr. Trump, who has clashed with Chief Justice Roberts over the perceived political bias of the federal courts, would have to count on him for a fair hearing when the fate of his presidency hangs in the balance.\n\nIt\u2019s a prospect that has caused rumblings in Washington that the chief justice should recuse himself.\n\nJohn Cardillo, a conservative radio personality and host on Newsmax TV, sounded the recusal alarm.\n\n\u201cThere is already a crisis of confidence among the American people that we have a fair system of justice. When you have a chief justice of the Supreme Court overtly making comments that are derogatory to the president of the United States, take all speculation out of the process,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the recusal question extends down the bench of the high court. All of the justices likely will play a role in deciding Congress\u2019 subpoenas power over the executive branch as House Democrats conduct an impeachment inquiry.\n\nChief Justice Roberts and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg have publicly commented on Mr. Trump in recent years, including Justice Ginsburg going as far as calling him a \u201cfaker\u201d and the chief justice sending a sharp rebuke to the commander in chief over the political independence of the judiciary.\n\nThe issue of potential bias comes about a year after Justice Roberts released an unusual statement, indirectly firing back at the president over his politicization of judges based on the president who appointed them.\n\n\u201cWe do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,\u201d Justice Roberts said in a statement in November 2018 issued from the court\u2019s public information office.\n\n\u201cWhat we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them,\u201d he added.\n\nThe rare rebuke of the president came after Mr. Trump was critical about a ruling issued from a district judge in California against his administration.\n\n\u201cSorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have \u2018Obama judges,\u2019 and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country,\u201d the president fired back on Twitter.\n\nJustice Roberts\u2018 defenders insist that the eyebrow-raising statement does not demonstrate a conflict of interest or at least not one significant enough to require him to step aside from overseeing Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment trial.\n\n\u201cRoberts\u2018 comments were about as even-keeled as they get,\u201d said Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law, adding in an impeachment trial, \u201cThe chief justice\u2019s role is fairly limited.\u201d\n\nMark Graber, a constitutional law professor at the University of Maryland, went a step further.\n\n\u201cThere is nobody on the court who ought to be recused,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, the justices likely will play a critical role in the subpoena fight over which administration documents and testimony House Democrats get their hands on.\n\nWithout directly weighing in on the issue of impeachment and Congress\u2019 subpoena power, a federal court last week ruled that Mr. Trump\u2019s accounting firm had to turn over tax documents to House Democrats in one of their many probes into Mr. Trump and his financial dealings.\n\nThe case involving the financial documents could test the president\u2019s executive authority to thwart the congressional subpoenas.\n\nIlya Shapiro, who publishes the Cato Institute\u2019s \u201cSupreme Court Review,\u201d said an emergency petition to halt a lower court decision in the impeachment inquiry likely would be filed with the justices in the future.\n\nIf so, the debate over recusals might be raised against Justice Ginsburg, whose comments during the 2016 campaign about then-candidate Donald Trump likely crossed the line of what is permitted by a justice.\n\nJustice Ginsburg has apologized for calling Mr. Trump a \u201cfaker.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego,\u201d she told CNN in 2016. \u201cHow has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns? The press seems to be very gentle with him on that.\u201d\n\nIn response, Mr. Trump called for the senior justice\u2019s resignation.\n\nMr. Graber, though, said the liberal icon\u2019s remarks about the 2016 campaign have been worked out and she has weighed in on several legal challenges involving the administration during the president\u2019s first three years in office.\n\nJustices Neil Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh \u201care Trump appointees \u2014 nobody is talking about recusing them, and for good reason,\u201d Mr. Graber said.\n\nMr. Shaprio said Justice Roberts\u2018 role in the impeachment proceeding would be more like a \u201ctraffic cop than trial judge,\u201d and he flatly dismissed any questions over Justice Ginsburg\u2019s alleged bias.\n\n\u201cHer comments in no way prejudged the legal issues at stake,\u201d he said.\n\nIf Justice Roberts did decide not to preside over a Senate impeachment trial, the most senior justice, Justice Clarence Thomas, would then step in, Mr. Blackman said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
