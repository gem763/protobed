The Sacklers are no longer on the Purdue Pharma board, The Stamford Advocate reports.\n\nPurdue filed for bankruptcy in September as part of an effort to settle nearly 2,700 lawsuits that seek to hold the company accountable for its role in the nation's opioid epidemic.\n\nOpioids were involved in almost 400,000 overdose deaths in the United States from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe company is trying to reach a settlement that could be worth up to $12 billion over time.\n\nOxyContin maker Purdue Pharma paid its CEO $9 million and its board chairman nearly $4 million in the 12 months before the declared bankruptcy filing last month. Pictured is board chairman Steve Miller\n\nPurdue Pharma, OxyContin's manufacturer, flied for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection\n\nCharles Elson, from the University of Delaware, told The Washington Post: 'In a public company, that would be a rather extraordinary sum to pay a non-exec chair. In a private company, it's private and it's between them.'\n\nThe company, forced to reveal its financial information as a part of its bankruptcy proceedings, said: 'During the past several years, employees have had to work under very challenging conditions as litigation has accelerated and the company has been targeted by the plaintiffs in the media.\n\n'Throughout this period, Purdue's employees and executives have maintained their professionalism and continued to develop, manufacture and provide safe and effective, FDA-approved medicines to meet patients' needs.'\n\nBoard chairman Steve Miller, known for helping restructure struggling companies, was brought in last year.\n\nThe new documents do not include any information on how the Sackler family have been paid. Previous documents put that figure at $12 billion to $13 billion.\n\nPurdue has said it is ready to make payments to the plaintiffs totaling $10 billion to $12 billion - with $3 billion coming from the Sackler family - if they drop all legal action.\n\nBut nearly 25 states, including New York, have rejected the proposal.\n\nRaymond and Beverly Sackler. Beverly, one of the owners of OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma and a former board member, died earlier this month aged 94. Raymond died in 2017\n\nRichard Sackler, right, headed Purdue from 1999 to 2003 and oversaw much of the increasing sales of OxyContin as it was being advertised. Jonathan Sackler, left, is to testify in lawsuit against the drug maker over its role in the national opioid epidemic it was revealed in August\n\nThe offer from Purdue and the Sacklers falls far short of paying for 'the death and destruction they inflicted on the American people,' said New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nAnd while OxyContin wasn't the only drug peddled out of the clinics, when the opioid crisis took off in 2001, it was easily the most popular.\n\nA major reason, the Drug Enforcement Agency claimed, was the Purdue marketing campaign misled doctors and patients alike to believe OxyContin was less addictive and safer than other opioids.\n\nThe Sackler family, though, has maintained they are not to blame for the crisis. In June, David Sackler told Vanity Fair that the family has had to endure 'vitriolic hyperbole' and 'endless castigation.'\n\nBeverly Sackler, one of the owners of OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma and a former board member, died earlier this month aged 94.\n\nThe Sacklers and their company Purdue Pharma have been blamed for helping spark the opioid crisis that has killed more than 400,000 people in the US in the last two decades\n\nPurdue Pharma was founded by brothers (L to R) Mortimer, Raymond and Arthur Sackler\n\nProtesters are seen outside the company's headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut\n\nA Wall Street Journal reports indicates the beleaguered family, worth an estimated $13 billion by Forbes, may be trying to shield its wealth.\n\n'The Sacklers want the bankruptcy court to stop our lawsuits so they can keep the billions of dollars they pocketed from OxyContin and walk away without ever being held accountable. That's unacceptable,' Maura Healey, the Massachusetts attorney general, said in a statement earlier this month.\n\nOxyContin, an anti-pain medication similar to morphine, was introduced to the American market in 1996 with a campaign that swept aside years of caution on the use of opioids, previously reserved for the gravely ill because of their highly addictive nature.\n\nThe campaign featured deceptive marketing, controversial sales practices and endorsements from eminent physicians generously remunerated by Purdue Pharma.", "description": "Five other board members were paid a combined $3.7 million over that span.
