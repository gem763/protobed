REUTERS/Peter Cziborra\n\nFour people died and 17 are missing after the most powerful typhoon to hit Japan in decades hammered the Tokyo area on Saturday, causing widespread flooding and leaving almost half a million homes without power.\n\nEngland had been due to play France in Yokohama on Saturday night but the game was cancelled as the serious threat posed by the huge storm became apparent.\n\nTo avoid it the squad decamped for a \u201cbeef and beer\u201d break at the holiday resort where they had their pre-tournament training camp and well away from the Typhoon\u2019s path. From there they will have a three-hour coach trio to Oita on Monday, where they will continue the build up to their quarter-final in a week\u2019s time - likely to be against Australia.\n\nAfter a full-on training session on Saturday, Vunipola said: \u201cIt\u2019s worrying, but we\u2019re lucky \u2013 we\u2019re pretty sheltered from a lot of that. I didn\u2019t realise how big or how bad the typhoon was going to be until we got told the news.\n\n\u201cObviously you\u2019re focused on rugby but you know it\u2019s not the be-all and end-all.\u201d\n\nVunipola\u2019s father Fe\u2019ao, a former captain of Tonga, was in Tokyo for the France game, along with other members of his extended family.\n\n\u201cYou worry for people\u2019s safety in typhoons and you hope and pray that nothing serious does happen,\u201d Vunipola said.\n\nVunipola is in the running for his first start of the tournament as he battles back to fitness from a serious hamstring injury sustained in May.\n\nHis brother Billy is also expected to be fit after twisting an ankle and having to come off at halftime in the win over Argentina.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s in good spirits and confident he\u2019ll be available for selection, which is good for him,\u201d Mako said of the number eight. \u201cHe\u2019s done all his bits with icing and he\u2019s under good care with the physios.\u201d\n\nWinger Jack Nowell, who made his first appearance since May coming off the bench against Argentina, is the only other member of the squad to be a fitness doubt for the quarter-final but it is expected he will be available for selection.", "description": "England prop Mako Vunipola said he is praying for those affected by Typhoon Hagibis - including members of his own family - as England continue their World Cup preparations in Miyazaki, around 870 km (540 miles) to the south-west of Tokyo.", "authors": ["Mitch Phillips", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440233097&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C02Q", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
