Before they were arrested Wednesday night at Dulles International Airport, Giuliani was supposed to meet the men in Vienna.\n\n\u201cGiuliani\u2019s cronies \u2014 who Trump pretends not to know even though he\u2019s pictured with them multiple times giving the thumbs up, no less \u2014 have been arrested trying to flee the country, one day before Rudy was scheduled to join them in Vienna and hours after dining with him at the Trump Hotel,\u201d Bedingfield noted.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
