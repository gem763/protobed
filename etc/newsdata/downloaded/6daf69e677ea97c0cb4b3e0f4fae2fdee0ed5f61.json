The Washington Post reports that McConnell envisions the trial taking place as soon as Americans sit down to a turkey dinner:\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell told Republican senators Wednesday to be ready for an impeachment trial of President Trump as soon as Thanksgiving, as the Senate began to brace for a political maelstrom that would engulf the nation. An air of inevitability has taken hold in Congress, with the expectation Trump will become the third president in history to be impeached \u2014 and Republicans believe they need to prepare to defend the president. While McConnell briefed senators on what would happen during a Senate trial, House GOP leaders convened what they expect will be regular impeachment strategy sessions.\n\nThe inevitability of an impeachment trial isn\u2019t a shock. Nancy Pelosi\u2019s alea iacta est declaration last month all but committed her to impeaching Trump. Even though the whistleblower complaint that prompted her call turned out to be less than advertised by Adam Schiff, she\u2019s now stuck with it. To shut down an inquiry now would risk tearing her party apart ahead of the 2020 election, and Pelosi knows it.\n\nNor is the timeline for impeachment too surprising. The last thing Pelosi needs \u2014 well, besides impeachment itself, anyway \u2014 is an impeachment and/or trial that takes place in the middle of Democratic primary voting. That\u2019s not just for presidential candidates, but also for incumbents in House districts and Senate candidates in red-to-purple states as well. Thanksgiving might be a little ambitious, especially since Pelosi won\u2019t even hold an authorization vote on the full House floor for an impeachment inquiry, but she will want to hand this off to the Senate before Christmas, anyway.\n\nWhat might be the most surprising is McConnell\u2019s apparent estimate for the time needed to deal with the trial:\n\nMcConnell said the Senate would likely meet six days a week during the trial, lawmakers said. \u201cThere\u2019s sort of a planned expectation that it would be sometime around Thanksgiving, so you\u2019d have basically Thanksgiving to Christmas \u2014 which would be wonderful because there\u2019s no deadline in the world like the next break to motivate senators,\u201d Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said.\n\nSix days a week for four weeks? That\u2019s a much longer trial than McConnell hinted might take place late last month. While speaking to CNBC, the Senate Majority Leader acknowledged that the upper chamber\u2019s rules require a trial in any case of impeachment, but also that \u201chow long you are on it is a different matter[.]\u201d That appeared to suggest that McConnell was considering a quick dismissal motion or perhaps a call to go directly to a verdict vote, dispensing with the rest of the trial \u2014 either of which would be allowable under Senate rules.\n\nIt now sounds as though McConnell believes Senate Republicans will need to put on a defense of President Trump. That would allow Republicans to seize the narrative back again after House Democrats have controlled it with leaks from their closed hearings, a smart if ethically questionable strategy employed by Schiff. Senate Republicans can demand all of those interviews and publish the full transcripts, identify witnesses, and call even more in rebuttal. Senate Democrats will largely be stuck with the case presented by House Democrats without much room to add to it, since the articles of impeachment will have already been set.\n\nThe risk is that the transcripts and the witnesses might not paint a very pretty picture of the president or his administration, even in the full context of the testimony. The media will largely want to reaffirm its earlier reporting based on the selective leaks from House Democrats and may not add much context for their consumers regardless of what Republicans expose. However, unless McConnell and his caucus can expose falsehoods by Trump\u2019s accusers and blatant hypocrisy, Senate Republicans might end up winning a Pyrrhic victory in an extended trial \u2014 keeping Trump in office but leaving him mortally wounded politically, and perhaps themselves as well.\n\nIf McConnell thinks it\u2019s necessary to run that risk, it says something about what he\u2019s seeing in the House, and what it says is nothing good for the White House.\n\nNote* \u2013 I assume everyone understands this reference \u2026", "description": "Portents.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rosemarys-baby.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
