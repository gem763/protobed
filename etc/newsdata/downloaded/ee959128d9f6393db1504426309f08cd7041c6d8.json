The person wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss the ongoing matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe move is likely to raise alarm among Democrats that the Trump administration may be trying to use the government to investigate the president\u2019s political opponents.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what potential crimes are being investigated. But the move gives prosecutors the ability to issue subpoenas and potentially empanel a grand jury.\n\nDOJ had previously considered it to be an administrative review, and it\u2019s unclear when the probe transitioned to a criminal investigation.\n\nTrump has repeatedly railed against special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Justice Department has shifted its review of the Russia investigation to a formal criminal inquiry.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Balsamo"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/06/sept._11_saudi_arabia_lawsuits_99797_c0-140-3354-2096_s1200x700.jpg?8896bfdb0a3e95e097190db3c6bf547699529da8", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
