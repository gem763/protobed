She must satisfy the demands of both liberal and conservative Democrats while taking on President Trump, anticipating political moves before they happen.\n\nQueen to Rook 5. Knight to King 3. Maneuvering a knight deep into enemy territory, able to move in eight directions.\n\nBut, some lawmakers were taken aback at Pelosi\u2019s move to fully back an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cIt is a colossal error,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said of the push by House Democrats to impeach Trump. \u201cI\u2019m kind of surprised that Speaker Pelosi, as shrewd as she is, would let it get to this point.\u201d\n\nDid Pelosi, D-Calif., misstep? Fail to read the tea leaves?\n\n\u201cWe have to strike while the iron is hot,\u201d she told a meeting of House Democrats last week.\n\nPelosi clearly was unwilling to move too precipitously or prejudge alleged transgressions by the president on a host of subjects for months. This came as liberals mounted a robust push to impeach Trump once Democrats secured control of the House in the 2018 midterms. But, it\u2019s hard to believe Pelosi didn\u2019t suspect where this may have gone. After all, she had not declared that impeachment was \u201coff the table\u201d like she did in 2006 with then-President George W. Bush.\n\nIf the House was going to impeach the president, Pelosi needed clarity, something succinct and comprehensible. All of the other \u201cnoise\u201d about Trump\u2019s conduct may have been reprehensible and beneath the dignity of the president in the eyes of the speaker, but sources familiar with her thinking said those potential misdeeds weren\u2019t worthy of impeachment.\n\nAt a new conference this past May, Pelosi said the president \u201cis almost self-impeaching.\u201d There was a supposition that Pelosi suspected Trump \u2013 at least from her vantage point \u2013 may commit a misstep so egregious that impeachment would be inevitable. That\u2019s why Pelosi never slammed the door to impeachment the way she did in 2006. Moreover, some people close to the speaker said she suspected House Democrats might come around to impeachment.\n\nTypically, congressional leaders have held certain views which weren\u2019t reflected by their rank-and-file members. Being a congressional leader means seeing around corners, anticipating where your own members may be, or subtly convincing those members to come around to your viewpoint, without them even realizing they\u2019re been influenced. But, those close to Pelosi doubted she really wanted to impeach Trump. After all, this would hijack the Democrats\u2019 message of health care, prescription drugs and background checks for guns.\n\nIt would have been toxic for Pelosi to push impeachment actively just a few months ago. More importantly, it would have been more perilous yet for Pelosi to put vulnerable, rank-and-file Democrats in an awkward position on impeachment. However, Pelosi clearly knew how her members could \u201ceducate\u201d their constituents into supporting a given measure. She also knew that \u201cevents\u201d sometimes would dictate outcomes.\n\nSo, Pelosi bided her time. Yes, impeachment could come with downfalls, but it was possible even moderate Democrats representing swing districts might eventually flip the impeachment switch.\n\nThe memo and the notes from the phone call on Ukraine provided that clarity to House Democrats and Pelosi.\n\n\u201cThis movement was organic,\u201d said one House Democrat about the sudden groundswell from some Democrats representing districts friendly to the president. \u201cThere was no collaboration.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, liberal Democrats already supported impeachment and were getting antsy for the leadership to do something. That posed a risk to Pelosi on the other side of the party spectrum.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., sounded almost desperate about the state of play on impeachment as she walked down the Capitol steps a week-and-a-half-ago.\n\n\u201cWe need to do the work,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cMy worry is that if we allow [Trump] to get away with it... by not impeaching, we are saying it is okay for future presidents to do this.\u201d\n\nPelosi knew she faced increasing pressure from liberals to move. And, sources close to the speaker told Fox News that Pelosi was concerned about not doing the right thing. There would be political consequences for not acting, too. But, Fox News was told the whistleblower complaint was all the speaker needed.\n\nA team of freshman House Democrats who served in the intelligence community and military \u2013 and who transferred districts from red to blue \u2013 penned an op-ed in the Washington Post. They called for an impeachment inquiry.\n\nSome analysts said the dam broke. The tide rose. They crossed the Rubicon. Whatever the metaphor, dozens of Democrats then joined the call for a formal impeachment inquiry or to actually impeach Trump.\n\nIt was clear to Pelosi that she had the support to move ahead. Her announcement simply reflected the view of her caucus, and not just because Democrats wanted to impeach Trump because they didn\u2019t like him. Rather, Pelosi viewed potential efforts to interfere with the 2020 presidential election as a bridge too far.\n\n\u201cI feel that I am being vindicated,\u201d boasted Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, who has tried multiple times to impeach Trump on the floor. \u201cThis is being driven by history now. I don\u2019t think that we have control. I think that events have taken control.\u201d\n\nPelosi\u2019s announcement buoyed Ocasio-Cortez. When asked if it took too long to launch the impeachment inquest, the New York Democrat replied, \u201cat this point, it doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019re moving forward with it now.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez added \u201cthat the party is now much more unified\u201d over impeachment since it was no longer a fight between wings of the House Democrats.\n\nBARR ASKED TRUMP TO SPEAK TO OTHER COUNTRIES IN DURHAM PROBE, OFFICIAL SAYS, AMID PUSHBACK TO NY TIMES REPORTING\n\nBut, not everyone was on board.\n\nWhen asked if he backed the House\u2019s new posture just minutes after Pelosi\u2019s announcement, Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon, one of the most conservative Democrats in the House, replied: \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure that out. I don\u2019t want the country torn apart.\u201d\n\nRep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, a freshman Democrat, won his seat after former Rep. Frank LoBiondo, a Republican, retired. Trump had carried the district by five points.\n\nVan Drew said he did not \u201csupport impeachment,\u201d but he would not call the impeachment movement \u201ca mistake.\u201d\n\nRep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., also claimed what had been a GOP district in the Garden State for decades. She was one of the freshmen with national security bona fides who wrote the Washington Post op-ed favoring impeachment. President Trump narrowly carried her district in 2016.\n\nCould impeachment put Sherrill in electoral jeopardy?\n\n\u201cYou know, it might,\u201d replied Sherrill. \u201cBut, we really felt there was a line that had been crossed.\u201d\n\nSherrill noted that the \u201cRepublicans I\u2019ve spoken to in my district have been very supportive.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nIn a twist, Pelosi\u2019s decision to move an impeachment probe could actually boost moderate Democrats including Schrader and Van Drew if they ultimately oppose impeachment. Pelosi\u2019s maneuver would present them with a foil. Conservative Democrats could put distance between themselves, the speaker and progressives such as Green and Ocasio-Cortez. Those conservative Democrats could argue they opposed such an extreme tactic as impeachment \u2013 and maybe even vote against articles on the House floor.\n\nThis has been the interdimensional chess facing Pelosi in her caucus. Anyone who tells you where this is really going doesn\u2019t truly know. It may, as Cornyn asserted, manifest itself as a \u201ccolossal error,\u201d or it may be turn out to be quite an astute move. There are always risks for impeachment, but the first waters Pelosi had to successfully navigate were the dangerous shoals of her own caucus.", "description": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi must satisfy the demands of both liberal and conservative Democrats while taking on President Trump, anticipating political moves before they happen.", "authors": ["Chad Pergram"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/30/694940094001_6090566895001_6090564001001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
