Stress in pregnancy makes women more vulnerable to smoking and air pollution, research suggested in July 2017. Highly-stressed pregnant women who smoke are significantly more likely to have low-birth weight babies than more relaxed expecting smokers, a study review found. The combination of high stress and air pollution also increases the risk of having a low-birth weight baby, the research adds. Senior author Professor Tracey Woodruff, from the University of California, San Francisco, said: 'It appears that stress may amplify the health effects of toxic chemical exposure, which means that for some people, toxic chemicals become more toxic.' Co-author Professor Rachel Morello-Frosch, from the University of California, Berkeley, added: 'The bottom line is that poverty-related stress may make people more susceptible to the negative effects of environmental health hazards, and that needs to be a consideration for policymakers and regulators.' The researchers analysed 17 human studies and 22 animal trials that investigated the link between stress, chemicals and foetal development. Stress was defined by factors such as socioeconomic status. Professor Morello-Frosch added: 'While the evidence on the combined effects of chemicals and stress is new and emerging, it is clearly suggestive of an important question of social justice.'\n\nAmong women who were physically stressed, less than a third (31 per cent) gave birth to a boy, a ratio of nine girls to every four boys.\n\nOne in six women were psychologically stressed, typically reporting negative feelings during their day, feeling overwhelmed and out of control, or indicating mild to moderate depression or anxiety.\n\nA similar number showed signs of physical stress, such as higher blood pressure and a tendency to consume more calories, suggestive of comfort eating.\n\nDr Monk and colleagues said male foetuses are less likely to 'survive in suboptimal conditions' for an abundance of biological reasons.\n\nFor example, male foetuses are slower to mature, which leaves a larger window of vulnerability.\n\nPrevious research has shown that female foetuses are tougher and more likely to survive.\n\nThe findings were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe academics said the impact of stress on male births can be seen on a population level after events such as 9/11 or earthquakes.\n\nStudies have shown 12 per cent more male babies were lost in September 2001 after the 20th week of pregnancy than expected.\n\nResearchers were surprised to find the odds of having a boy improved dramatically if the mother felt supported by friends and family.\n\nWomen who were stressed didn't report having people they could talk to, spend time with and rely on as much as health women.\n\nDr Monk said: 'Screening for depression and anxiety are gradually becoming a routine part of prenatal practice.\n\n'But while our study was small, the results suggest enhancing social support is potentially an effective target for clinical intervention.'\n\nThe study also found physically stressed pregnant women were more likely to give birth prematurely than healthy mothers.\n\nBut psychologically stressed mothers had more birth complications than both healthy mothers and physically stressed mothers.", "description": "Only 31 per cent of women showing physical stress, such as comfort eating, had a boy in a study of almost 200 women by Columbia University Irving Medical Center.", "authors": ["Vanessa Chalmers Health Reporter For Mailonline", "Victoria Allen Science Correspondent For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/16/19690882-0-image-a-60_1571068491019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
