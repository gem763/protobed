Kazuyo Sejima & Associates\n\nIts huge, curved windows provide passengers with stunning panoramic views along the way.\n\nInside, Laview is kitted out with soft yellow chairs with an adjustable headrest and armrest table to \"provide a relaxing living room-like feel.\"\n\nThe soft lighting, which adjusts throughout the day, has been devised to generate a calming atmosphere for commuters.\n\nLaview is the first train design from Sejima, who was tasked with coming up with a new \"never seen before\" concept that would set the tone for the railway company's future creations.\n\n\"The most obvious difference is that the train can move to different places,\" said Sejima in a statement.\n\n\"This train moves through the city to the mountains of Chichibu and I thought it would be nice for the train to be able to respond and blend into the surroundings in a soft way. Also, I wanted to make a train which feels like a living room where passengers can freely relax and feel motivated to ride.\"\n\nComfortable commute\n\nDesigned by architect Kazuyo Sejima, the train has soft chairs with an adjustable headrest and armrest table. Kazuyo Sejima & Associates\n\nAlmost every detail of Laview, which has eight cars and 422 seats, has been carefully thought out to allow commuters to feel at ease as the train hits speeds of up to 120 kilometers (75 miles) per hour.\n\nEven its name has a special meaning -- the \"l\" stands for \"luxurious living,\" the \"a\" is for \"speedy like an arrow,\" and the \"view\" is pretty self-explanatory.\n\nThe aluminum paint used on the train's exterior was developed specially for Seibu Railway.", "description": "Seibu Railway's sleek \"Laview\" train in Japan not only gets you from Point A to Point B fast, it's designed for comfort.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F190911103544-beautiful-bullet-train---laview-exterior2-3-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
