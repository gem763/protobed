The Duke of Sussex gave an emotional speech about what an honor it was to participate in the awards ceremony, especially after becoming a father earlier this year.\n\n\"They never fail to inspire me -- but this year it resonates in a different way as now I'm a father,\" Harry, who welcomed son Archie in May with wife Meghan Markle, told the audience. \"Last year, when my wife and I attended [the WellChild Awards], we knew that we were going to have a child, no one else knew but we did.\"\n\nVisibly choked up, the 35-year-old royal -- who was dressed in a dark suit and light blue tie -- paused his speech as British TV personality Gaby Roslin put a hand on his shoulder to comfort him.\n\n\"I remember squeezing Meghan's hand so tight during the awards and both of us thinking what it would be like to be parents one day and more so what it would be like to protect and help our child should they be born with immediate challenges or become unwell over time,\" he continued after gaining his composure. \"And now talking to all of you as a parent pulls at my heartstrings, in a way I never could have understood, until I had a child of my own. No parent wants to hear that their child will suffer, that they will face extraordinary challenges -- that will affect them throughout their lives.\"\n\nView photos TOBY MELVILLE/POOL/AFP via Getty Images More\n\nView photos TOBY MELVILLE/POOL/AFP via Getty Images More\n\nTuesday marked the one-year anniversary of when Meghan and Harry announced they were expecting their first child, just months after tying the knot at Windsor Castle.\n\nMeghan, 38, was also at the awards ceremony, and the couple gushed over their 5-month-old son.
