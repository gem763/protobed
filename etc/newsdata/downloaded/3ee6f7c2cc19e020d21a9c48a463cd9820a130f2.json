(Jamie Squire/Getty Images)\n\nThe Indianapolis Colts and Los Angeles Chargers headed to overtime in Week 1, with the Chargers scoring a touchdown on their first possession to win. Here\u2019s a refresher on the rules.\n\nAfter both the NFC and AFC championship games went into overtime in January, tweaking the rules that govern the extra period was up for consideration, particularly because the Kansas City Chiefs never touched the ball in their overtime loss to the New England Patriots.\n\nThere were calls for both teams to get a crack at scoring, for a way to take the coin toss out of the mix, but nothing materialized and any changes were kicked down the road until 2020.\n\nSo, for the 2019 season, rules governing the regular season and playoffs remain unchanged.\n\nREGULAR-SEASON OVERTIME RULES\n\nAt the end of regulation, a coin toss will determine which team gets the ball first in overtime. The visiting team captain will call the toss.\n\nNo more than one 10-minute period will follow a three-minute intermission. Each team must possess, or have the opportunity to possess, the ball. There is one exception: If the team that gets the ball first scores a touchdown on the opening possession, as the Patriots did against the Chiefs, the game is over.\n\nSudden death play \u2014 where the game ends on any score (safety, field goal or touchdown) \u2014 continues until a winner is determined.\n\nEach team gets two timeouts.\n\nThe extra point is not attempted if the game ends on a touchdown.\n\nIf the score is tied at the end of overtime, the game ends in a tie.\n\nThere are no instant replay coach\u2019s challenges; all reviews will be initiated by the replay official.\n\nPOSTSEASON OVERTIME RULES\n\nOf course, postseason games cannot end in a tie, and so the rules are slightly different.\n\nIf the score is still tied at the end of an overtime period \u2014 or if the second team\u2019s initial possession has not ended \u2014 the teams will play another period. The teams will continue to play no matter how many overtime periods are required to determine a winner.\n\nA two-minute intermission will be taken between each overtime period. There is no \u201chalftime,\u201d however.\n\nThe captain who lost the first overtime coin toss will either choose to possess the ball or select which goal his team will defend in the second overtime, unless the team that won the coin toss deferred that choice.\n\nEach team gets three timeouts during a half.\n\nThe same timing rules that apply at the end of the second and fourth regulation periods also apply at the end of a second or fourth overtime period.\n\nIf there is still no winner at the end of a fourth overtime period, there will be another coin toss, and play will continue until a winner is declared.\n\nThe Chiefs had proposed changing the rule after losing the AFC title game when the Patriots reached the end zone on their first possession, the only scenario by which an OT game can end after one possession. Atlanta Falcons President Rich McKay, the chairman of the league\u2019s competition committee, said in May that the Chiefs planned to resubmit their proposal, which could take effect in the 2020 season, next year at the annual meetings.\n\n\u201cThese are rules that typically take time,\u201d McKay said.\n\nLast season, two regular-season games ended in ties, both in the first month of play. The Steelers and Browns finished in a 21-21 tie on Sept. 9 and the Vikings and Packers game ended in a 29-29 tie the following week.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nA visual guide to 20 seasons of Daniel Snyder\u2019s Redskins ownership\n\n2019 NFL predictions: Division, wild card and Super Bowl picks\n\nHow Kyler Murray went from being a 5-foot-5 high school star to the NFL\u2019s most anticipated quarterback\n\nCase Keenum is an unwanted QB who keeps winning jobs.
