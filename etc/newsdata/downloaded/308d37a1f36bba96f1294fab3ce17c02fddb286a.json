Fancy furniture, paintings on the walls. But it was his home.\u201d\n\nJean-Luc Brunel: three former models say they were sexually assaulted by Jeffrey Epstein friend Read more\n\nNot long before, Huisman had met Jean-Luc Brunel in a chocolate shop round the corner from Models Office, the Brussels agency that had just begun to represent her. Its owners, Pierre and Marielou Eggermont, had said she must see him.\n\nHe was in his mid-40s and a charmer. \u201cHe said: \u2018You\u2019re unbelievable. You\u2019re stunning. You must come to Paris, right away. I can make you a star,\u2019\u201d says Huisman, now a TV editor-in-chief, sitting in the kitchen of her home in a neat new suburb of Amsterdam.\n\nHer agents were sure: Brunel could launch her. Karin Models, his agency, had done it before and would do it again: Monica Bellucci, Sharon Stone, Christy Turlington, Jerry Hall, Milla Jovovich \u2013 all, Brunel has since claimed, owe their careers to him.\n\nSo Huisman, 46, went to Paris. She was so special that she was to stay in his apartment, Brunel told her. But within a week she had left, because on her fourth or fifth night, she says, Brunel \u2013 who has been accused of supplying the late Jeffrey Epstein, his close friend, with underage girls \u2013 spiked her drink and raped her.\n\nAllegations of misconduct against Brunel date back decades, but he has faced no action. Husiman and two other former models have told the Guardian they were sexually assaulted by Brunel in the 1980s and 1990s in and around Paris, where he was a power player in the global fashion industry.\n\nBrunel and his attorney did not respond to requests for comment. In a 2015 statement, Brunel vehemently denied involvement \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d in Epstein\u2019s crimes. \u201cI strongly deny having committed any illicit act or any wrongdoing in the course of my work as a scouter or model agencies manager,\u201d he said then.\n\nBut from the first evening Huisman met Brunel, she says, relating the events of 28 years ago with calm but clearly painful precision, the Frenchman was \u201ccoming on to me. Really flirting. Like in a jokey way on one level, saying I was so lovely, that we\u2019d get married one day. But then also more menacing.\n\n\u201cSo when I asked where I was supposed to sleep, he said: \u2018Oh, my bed, of course.\u2019 One time, later, he came into the closet where I was, locked the door behind him, and told me: \u2018You know, one day we\u2019re going to have sex.\u2019 I kept him away, made a joke of it, told him he was too old for me, and too short. A short, old Frenchman.\u201d\n\nBut Huisman felt deeply uncomfortable. \u201cThere were lots of other girls there, some I recognised from magazines,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe half a dozen. Young girls, certainly some underage, from Czechoslovakia, Russia, Yugoslavia. They looked \u2026 sad. And these older, much older businessmen. It was obvious they were sleeping together.\u201d\n\nPart of her wondered whether this was all simply normal for the fashion industry. Part of her realised it could not possibly be right. And part of her thought: \u201cI want to be a model, the whole world awaits, and this man can make it happen. I just have to be careful. Not drink. Stay in control. Keep focused. I thought I could handle it.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Thysia Huisman was an 18-year-old model in 1991 who stayed at Jean-Luc Brunel\u2019s apartment.

The next day, Brunel\u2019s assistant Pamela took her to the agency and to lunch. The third day there was a test shoot, and a couple of go-sees \u2013 preliminary castings for multiple jobs. Every night there were dinners, groups of 15 or 20, in expensive restaurants.\n\nOne night, Brunel told Huisman that she could have a career in the movies too, and that \u201chis good friend the CEO of Miramax \u2013 I realised later, Harvey Weinstein \u2013 would be in Paris the following week, so I should really meet him.\u201d\n\nAnother evening, there was a man with wavy hair, in a black turtleneck sweater, black-and-white checked trousers. Quite striking. \u201cIt was \u2013 I\u2019m not 100% sure, I couldn\u2019t swear it,\u201d she says. \u201cBut years later, when Epstein was in jail for 13 months, all over the news \u2026 I saw him and I thought, I know that man.\u201d\n\nOn what was to be her final night in Paris, after a restaurant and nightclub, the party returned to Brunel\u2019s flat, Huisman says. \u201cHe gave me a drink. I don\u2019t know what it was, a mixed drink of some kind, he said he made it specially for me. I drank it and straight away I started feeling tired, woozy.\u201d\n\nHer recollections after that, she says, are \u201cvague, but with really clear, like, snapshots \u2013 like a fuzzy, unclear movie, all in slow motion, but with a few super-sharp stills. I remember he took me to his room, laid me on his bed, said I should relax. I recall him lying on top of me, me trying to push him off.\n\n\u201cI remember trying to move, but not really being able to. Like almost being paralysed. I heard the sound of my blouse, a black blouse, ripping. I had a black skirt, too. I felt him \u2013 this is difficult \u2013 between my legs. Pushing.\u201d\n\nShe was awoken the next morning, Huisman says, when Brunel\u2019s butler (he employed an Indian couple as cook and factotum) came in with a cup of tea. \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem surprised to see me there,\u201d she says. \u201cJean-Luc wasn\u2019t there. But I \u2026 felt we had had sex. I had marks, bruises, on my inner thighs. I knew. I know.\u201d\n\nShe was naked but for a kimono that was not hers, her clothes in a pile on the floor. \u201cI just ran,\u201d she says. \u201cI was scared. I grabbed my clothes, rushed to the other girl\u2019s room, got my backpack and left. Like a thief in the night. He was on the phone in the living room. I was scared what he would say.\u201d\n\nOn the street, she says, all the buildings \u201cwere like \u2026 moving. Everything sounded really loud. I felt totally disconnected.\u201d\n\nHuisman mentioned the incident to her Dutch boyfriend, she said, but in the vaguest terms, and told no one else. \u201cI was really ashamed,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt really stupid. Guilty. Angry with myself.\u201d Over the years, she said, she told various friends of an \u201cunpleasant incident\u201d in Paris. \u201cI buried it, really,\u201d she says.\n\nHer current partner, whom she met eight years ago, says she told him soon after they got together that she had been \u201cmolested\u201d. More details emerged gradually over time, he says, until, two years ago, he heard the whole ugly story.\n\n\u201cA lot of things happened at the same time,\u201d says Huisman. \u201cI started therapy and it came up. The #MeToo movement really stirred something in me. I began looking into Brunel; saw the scandals he was implicated in; realised the ties to Epstein; talked to women with similar experiences \u2026 It feels good to have brought it all out of the dark, to realise I was not the only one and it was not my fault.\u201d\n\nJustice may be too late for Epstein, who was found dead in his cell earlier this month while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. But she hopes Brunel will be prosecuted, even if he is now in his 70s. She has consulted a French lawyer and is considering filing a formal complaint in Paris.\n\n\u201cI hope he gets punished, and the whole modelling industry gets a shake-up,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not deluded; I don\u2019t imagine my story will change everything. But if a few more parents are made aware, if a few more industry figures realise these predators exist \u2026 Because, look, what really makes me angry \u2013 I called Marielou [Eggermont], from my very first agency in Brussels, this winter.\n\n\u201cI recorded the call. I asked, did they still work with Brunel? She said: \u201cYes, as a matter of fact he was over a few months ago.\u201d So I told her exactly what had happened, why I\u2019d come back in such a rush. And she said: \u2018You know, he can\u2019t have done that. He would never do that. Jean-Luc, he\u2019s just too sweet.\u2019\u201d", "description": "Ex-model is one of three women accusing the model scout and friend of Jeffrey Epstein", "authors": ["Jon Henley", "Jill Filipovic"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41eba6ef670e825c6c0cd01b531bd89b0d9e0957/0_0_653_392/master/653.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=03acba8889eb48897dfd2d859b8bd6c8", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
