The only woman on the list, Barbara Rentler, CEO of Ross Stores, clocked in at 75.\n\nThe reaction to the glaring lack of women was swift and sharp.\n\nReplies to Resma Saujani's tweet include politician Stacey Abrams, makeup brand Glossier founder Emily Weiss, Kimberly Bryant of Black Girls Code, Refugee Coffee Company CEO Kitti Murray, Spanx inventor Sara Blakely, Rihanna and Serena Williams.\n\nAnd in case Forbes needed more names, dozens of female CEOs \u2014 46 at last count, including designer Stella McCartney; Mariam Naficy, founder and CEO of Minted; and Sarah Leary, co-founder of NextDoor \u2014 signed an open letter to Forbes. Written by journalist Diana Kapp, author of the book Girls Who Run The World, the letter calls on the magazine to \"overhaul the criteria that determines who makes the cut.\"\n\nAnne Wojcicki, CEO and co-founder of genetic testing company 23andMe, signed Kapp's letter in hopes that it would encourage better representation.\n\n\"People are just acutely aware now of the importance of diversity,\" Wojcicki tells All Things Considered. \"And when something is so blatantly missing \u2014 a whole population \u2014 it's really surfaced and it comes to the attention of everyone now.\"\n\nAnd she says such titles aren't just about bragging rights.\n\n\"People do think about these lists,\" she says. \"They go online and think about board members or advisers and who it is that can help solve a problem. I think there are real ripple effects when this kind of press dominates. It's not just one article. It's how in general women are perceived.\"\n\nWojcicki says she's glad Forbes has admitted fault and is forming a task force to make sure this mistake isn't repeated. But at its root, she sees this as a problem with oversight.\n\n\"It's kind of shocking that this actually got through,\" she says. \"I would love to see their editorial policy of diversity represented at the top when they're starting to think about 'what are the lists we're going to put out?'\"\n\nWhen asked who she would put on that list of innovative leaders, she immediately mentioned her sister, Susan Wojcicki, a co-founder of Google and current CEO of YouTube.\n\n\"There's just a tremendous number of women out there who are phenomenal leaders.\"", "description": "The sole woman, Barbara Rentler of Ross Stores, clocked in at No. 75.
