Mitt Romney (R-UT) declared Friday that President Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion that China and Ukraine investigate former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s dealings with the two countries is \u201cwrong and appalling.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China\u2019s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,\u201d Romney wrote on Twitter. \u201cBy all appearances, the President\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling.\u201d\n\nBy all appearances, the President\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling. \u2014 Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) October 4, 2019\n\nThe Never Trump lawmaker\u2019s comments come after President Trump said Thursday that China should investigate Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, for alleged corruption.\n\n\u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as Ukraine,\u201d the president told reporters outside the White House ahead of a visit to Florida to deliver remarks on health care.\n\nAs Breitbart News extensively reported, Hunter Biden\u2019s investment firm secured a $1.5 billion investment deal with the Bank of China after traveling with his father on Air Force Two to the country in 2013.\n\nFurther, President Trump re-upped his call for Ukraine to look into the Biden family\u2019s dealings in the eastern European country.\n\nHe repeated his call for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens when reporters asked him again what he thought Ukranian officials should do with Biden, saying, \u201cI would think that if they were honest about it, they would start a major investigation\u201d into the former second family.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported earlier this year:\n\nBiden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden handsomely as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son\u2019s role.)\n\n\u201cNobody has any doubt that they weren\u2019t crooked; that was a crooked deal 100 percent,\u201d said the president.", "description": "Mitt Romney said President Trump's suggestion that China and Ukraine investigate Biden's dealings with the countries is \"wrong and appalling.\"", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/01/Mitt-Romney-hands-up-touchdown-ap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
