The animal is seen hanging off the bull bar and the front of the car is covered in blood - it is unclear if the wombat is dead\n\nA man in the video was heard saying: 'I've just punched the f*** out of the wombat, you weak c***'.\n\nBonorong Wildlife Sanctuary director Greg Irons said he was lost for words after watching the video on Tuesday.\n\n'You get these try-hard, loser bogans like this fella we've seen today, that is seen as something they want to copy to get some notoriety out of it, some sort of tough-guy image,' he told the ABC on Tuesday.\n\n'There is nothing tough about it, you are the weakest of the weak, to hurt an animal that cannot defend itself and 99.9 per cent of the community would agree,' he said.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment told Daily Mail Australia the video is being investigated.\n\n'The Department is currently investigating a video circulating on social media that suggests an individual has caused harm to a wombat,' the spokesperson said.\n\n'Alleged deliberate harming of any wildlife is completely unacceptable, and all reports are regarded extremely seriously by the Department.'\n\nThe video has emerged after South Australian police officer Waylon Johncock was filmed repeatedly throwing rocks at a wombat in the Eyre Peninsula, South Australia.\n\nJohncock, who was off-duty at the time, was seen chasing after the helpless wombat as a laughing associate filmed from a trailing car.\n\nThe man driving behind Johncock told him to 'get up close' before the policeman picked up a rock and hurled it at the animal as it tried to run away.\n\nWaylon Johncock, a South Australian police community liaison officer, is under investigation over disturbing footage shot on Eyre Peninsula earlier this month\n\nSome Aboriginal elders condemned Johncock while others defended him, saying he was within his rights because Indigenous people in South Australia have traditionally killed wombats with rocks.\n\nUnder the Native Title Act of 1993, Aboriginal people were allowed to maintain ancient customs such as hunting local wildlife. Johncock is Indigenous.\n\nJohncock was under investigation by police in relation to the video and more than 300,000 people signed an online petition calling for the officer to be disciplined and a review of the law.", "description": "WARNING: DISTRESSING CONTENT.
