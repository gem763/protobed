The rules of trickle-down are so easy to explain that even a child can understand them. You\u2019ve heard this mechanistic threat again and again: if you raise wages, you kill jobs. If you raise taxes on the wealthy, you\u2019ll hurt job creators. If you regulate business, you\u2019ll kill business. It\u2019s easy to say, it\u2019s easy to understand.\n\nAnd it\u2019s entirely wrong, of course. The fact is that the economic theory the Republican Party (and many Democrats) have accepted as gospel truth for the last 40 years turned out to be a pack of lies. But who ever let an inelegant little thing like reality intrude in an elegant economic belief system?\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTrickle-down is why Republicans are great at pitching their policies to everyday Americans. It\u2019s why, even though the economy thrives under Democrat presidents and grows sluggish when a Republican has the White House, the American people still trust Republicans much more than they trust Democrats on economic matters.\n\nRepublicans sold the Trump tax cuts with a shrug and a promise that the massive wealth transfer to rich people would pay for itself by trickling down to the middle class in the form of economic growth. Of course, the tax cuts didn\u2019t do that\u2014by most markers, the economy has been slowing down and even shrinking since they went into effect\u2014but the confidence with which Republicans sold their policy tricked many Americans into believing the cuts would work to their benefit.\n\nIn the wake of Trump\u2019s election, Democrats seem to have finally, thankfully, woken up to the lie behind trickle-down economics. The days in which I had to argue with Democratic leaders about the importance of a $15 minimum wage have long since passed. But the absence of a bad theory isn\u2019t enough.\n\nWhat the Democrats are missing is a coherent theory of growth. Thankfully, one is becoming clear. I recently gave a TED Talk about how economics really works: The more we include people in the economy, the stronger the economy will be. After all, consumer spending accounts for nearly 70 percent of GDP. Rich people like me aren\u2019t the job creators\u2014the spending power of the American middle class creates jobs.\n\nBecause the economic disparity has grown so glaringly huge, people are finally coming around to this new understanding of economics. And our policies are working: studies show that raising the minimum wage is an unalloyed good for everyone, and paid sick days are good for workers, public health, and employers alike. Yet Republicans still poll better on economic issues with the general public, because even though they\u2019re traditionally terrible at managing economies, they\u2019re great at talking about economics.\n\nIf we can correct the American people\u2019s mistaken belief that Republicans are stronger on economic issues, they will have nothing but craven racism and wackadoodle rightist identity politics to build a platform on. And I\u2019m enough of an optimist to believe that you can\u2019t win a national platform based solely on fear and hatred. The Democrat who will beat Donald Trump is the Democrat who can best explain how the economy works, and why it is imperative that we strengthen the American middle class.\n\nToo often, Democrats fall back on appeals to fairness to discuss the economy. Raising the minimum wage to $15 is the fair thing to do, they\u2019ll say. Providing a social safety net is an imperative for any moral society, they argue. And they\u2019re right\u2014those things are fair and moral. But you can\u2019t feed your children with morality, and fairness is a pretty poor substitute for a paycheck. Democrats also must explain why it\u2019s the right thing to do for the economy\u2014why it\u2019s financially better for everyone when we make sure that more Americans have money to spend in their communities.\n\nThis basic inability to discuss the economy trips up Democrats on every other issue, too. When pundits and conservatives inevitably ask Democrats how they\u2019re going to pay for the Green New Deal, or a public option, or massive infrastructure overhauls, candidates usually collapse into a stammering mess. The correct answer is that the economy is people\u2014any policy that allows more people to fully participate in the economy will pay for itself because economies that broadly include more people create more prosperity for everyone.\n\nSince we have a good, simple, and true story of how the economy works, why aren\u2019t we telling it? In the most recent Democratic debate, all 10 presidential candidates barely mentioned jobs, the middle class, and other important economic issues that most people care about. Even when candidates devoted their opening and closing statements to the economy, debate moderators have seemed adamant in their refusal to ask an economic question. Health care and gun responsibility are vital issues that absolutely affect every American, but with the scent of a recession in the air and with wealthy 1-percenters like me pulling in something to the tune of 2 trillion dollars a year at the expense of the middle class, people need to believe that Democratic politicians know what they\u2019re talking about.\n\nPresidential elections are often won or lost on the economy. So let\u2019s talk economics, Democrats. No, really: we need to talk about economic issues\u2014a lot, and in great detail. In fact, I\u2019m calling on my friend Tom Perez, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, to establish a presidential debate focusing solely on economics.\n\nThe importance of an economic debate is twofold. First, it will emphasize the Democratic Party\u2019s commitment to workers, highlighting candidates\u2019 core beliefs in policies including a higher overtime threshold for the middle class, higher taxes on the wealthy, debt forgiveness and corporate responsibility. This is vital in an environment when Republicans are still trusted more than Democrats on business matters.\n\nAnd secondly, it will convince Americans that Democrats have answers to the real problems they\u2019re facing every day. Ask any messaging expert and they\u2019ll tell you that the key to getting a message out there is simple: repetition, repetition, repetition. It\u2019s only by repeating these economic truths again and again in clear and crisp language that the American people will understand our story. The first Democrat to successfully close the economic loop\u2014to argue clearly and intelligently and simply that it\u2019s not just a moral imperative to raise wages for most Americans and raise taxes on the wealthy, but good business as well\u2014will have my support. And I\u2019m willing to wager that they will find the support of a majority of Americans, too.\n\nIt seems hard to believe right now in the heat of the impeachment discussion, but when you ignore all the spin and hot takes and assorted noise of the pundit class about the latest outrage committed by Donald Trump, the 2020 presidential election will likely come down to the exact same issues that every election ever comes down to: Can we pay our bills on time? Can we count on the same financial stability over the next 10 or 20 years that our parents enjoyed? Will our kids have a better life than we had? It all comes down to economics. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s vital that our presidential candidates demonstrate that they can answer these questions with grace, compassion, and understanding. Let\u2019s have that debate.\n\nThis article tagged under: Economy\n\nDemocrats\n\nDonald Trump", "description": "Democrats Need to Reclaim the Economy Narrative If They Want to Win in 2020", "authors": ["Nick Hanauer"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/70/41/976d3c7041b69e85e3cf181e793e/20191015-democrats-2020-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
