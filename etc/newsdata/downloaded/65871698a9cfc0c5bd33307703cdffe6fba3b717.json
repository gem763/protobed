There\u2019s no chance we\u2019ll even discipline him.'\u201d\n\nSilver also said he isn\u2019t sure what will happen to the NBA\u2019s relationship with China, which has been growing steadily over the last three decades.\n\n\u201cI felt we had made enormous progress in terms of building cultural exchanges with the Chinese people,\u201d Silver said. \u201cAgain, I have regret that much of that was lost. And I\u2019m not even sure where we\u2019ll go from here.\u201d\n\nThe league and LeBron James, one of its biggest stars, has been heavily criticized by some U.S. lawmakers for the perception that they caved to the Chinese regime. Morey has not been rebuked publicly by the league, and Silver has said that the league will support his freedom of expression.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make an absolute clear statement that the values of the NBA, these American values \u2014 we are an American business \u2014 travel with us wherever we go, and one of those values is free expression,\u201d Silver said. \u201cWe wanted to make sure everyone understood we were supporting free expression.\u201d\n\nThe Rockets were of massive interest in China, largely because of Yao Ming \u2014 the Chinese star who spent his entire NBA career in Houston. Yao is now the president of the Chinese Basketball Association, which has suspended its ties to the Rockets because of the tweet.\n\nMorey has not commented publicly since a pair of tweets on Oct. 6 attempting to clarify his position.\n\n\u201cI understand there is a point of view from some that we shouldn\u2019t be in business at all in China, and I\u2019d say from an intellectual standpoint, that\u2019s fair \u2014 not getting into whether the tweet or the response to it,\u201d Silver said.\n\nChinese state broadcaster CCTV did not air the two NBA preseason games between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets last week. Tencent, which has a $1.5 billion deal to stream NBA games in China over the next five years, has also stopped showing Rockets games but has not totally dropped all NBA content.\n\n\u201cThe losses have already been substantial,\u201d Silver said. \u201cOur games are not back on the air in China, as we speak, and we\u2019ll see what happens next.\u201d\n\nSilver was at the summit to discuss the league\u2019s deeper commitment to ensuring players and employees are taking care of their mental health, something that has been a growing topic in the NBA in recent years \u2014 particularly with the acknowledgment of top players like San Antonio\u2019s DeMar DeRozan and Cleveland\u2019s Kevin Love that they struggle with certain issues.\n\nSilver also addressed how social media can make matters more difficult for those who engage.\n\n\u201cSocial media, it seems pretty clear, is raising the anxiety level and stress level among our young people,\u201d Silver said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hate speech out there. There\u2019s stress to be included, there\u2019s emotional issues about being left out of groups. And then compound that with NBA players when there\u2019s in some cases millions and millions of seemingly anonymous people taking shots at them. And while the advice often is \u2018just don\u2019t read it,\u2019 it\u2019s awfully hard.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Chinese officials wanted Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey to be fired for his tweet supporting", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/17/f6a7e3_china-nba-relationship-96259-adam-silver-in-oct-2019-file-photo-nba-commissioner-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
