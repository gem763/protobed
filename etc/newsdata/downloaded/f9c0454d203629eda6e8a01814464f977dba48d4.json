As well as now being available on the App Store, it is also available on the Google Play Store. The app is a mobile version of a preexisting website, hkmap.live. (The BBC previously reported that the app had been approved by Apple.)\n\nApple initially rejected the anonymous developer's request to put the app on the App Store on the grounds it \"facilitates, enables, and encourages an activity that is not legal,\" the developer wrote on Twitter on October 1. Apple's rejection notice to the developer added that \"specifically, the app allowed users to evade law enforcement,\" they said.\n\nBut on Friday, the HKmap Live was approved, with the app's anonymous developer tweeting that Apple had \"finally made the right decision.\" They added: \"We understand Apple have many business considerations, but since they already make thing right I don't see any point to keep pressing [sic].\"\n\nIn a tweet two days later, the developer said Apple had \"received 0 legal complaint[s]\" regarding the app's availability.\n\nThe decision is a notable about-face from Apple, which has absolute control over what apps are and aren't allowed on its App Store. And it opens the company up to the possibility of repercussions in China, which is an important market for the California tech giant and whose government has been increasingly irked by the Hong Kong protests.\n\nThere had previously been significant criticism of Apple's decision to reject the app, with some pointing to Google-owned traffic app Waze as another service that effectively helps its users avoid the police by alerting them to law enforcement's presence but is allowed by Apple.\n\nProtests are ongoing in Hong Kong, with residents taking to the streets to demand civil liberties and protections from China's authoritarian government. Last week, a protester was shot in the chest by a police, and on Friday leader Carrie Lam announced the government had banned face masks in an attempt to clamp down on dissent.", "description": "After facing widespread criticism, Apple has reversed its decision to reject the app HKmap Live from its App Store.", "authors": ["Charlie Wood"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9c64ed5d21aa467c1133a5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
