(Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\nST. LOUIS \u2014 Mike Rizzo received good news during his phone call with Manager Dave Martinez on Tuesday. Rizzo, the Washington Nationals\u2019 general manager, learned that Martinez will not need any additional cardiac procedures in the near future. He learned that Martinez is home from the hospital and resting in Washington, even if his mind is filled with thoughts about his team\u2019s previous loss and its next matchup with the St. Louis Cardinals. And he learned, with all of that, Martinez can rejoin the Nationals as soon as he is cleared to travel.\n\nMartinez, 54, underwent a cardiac catheterization Monday in Washington after first feeling chest pains during the Nationals\u2019 game Sunday afternoon. Doctors mandated that he avoid air travel for an amount of time that Rizzo did not specify. A person with knowledge of the situation said it\u2019s likely two to three days if Martinez is capable of getting on a plane. That could put Martinez on schedule to manage the Nationals for their series opener against the Marlins on Friday in Miami.\n\nRizzo confirmed that bench coach Chip Hale will manage the club\u2019s final two games against the Cardinals, starting with the 7:45 p.m. matchup Tuesday. The general manager would not put a timetable on Martinez\u2019s return, knowing that plans are subject to change. Washington has a day off Thursday in Miami before playing 11 games in 10 days to finish the regular season.\n\n\u201cNothing major,\u201d Rizzo said of Martinez\u2019s test results. \"The [cardiac catheterization] is the only thing that he had. He\u2019s going to take some further testing down the road, but there is nothing vital that he has to take now. [The later testing is] to monitor him for the long term.\u201d\n\nA cardiac catheterization, according to the Mayo Clinic, is a procedure used to diagnose and treat certain cardiovascular conditions. It requires doctors to insert a catheter in an artery or vein in a person\u2019s groin, neck or arm, and that catheter is threaded through the patient\u2019s blood vessels to the heart. That allows doctors to run diagnostic tests and see if a person\u2019s heart is in a state that requires further testing or procedures. Martinez\u2019s overall results were encouraging.\n\nIn the meantime, the second-year manager continues to be involved from afar. He texted Hale the lineup for Monday\u2019s 4-2 loss. He did so again for Tuesday\u2019s game and broke down the results with Rizzo when they chatted on the phone. Rizzo noted that it was more baseball talk than health talk, a signal to him that Martinez is feeling like himself, and he was optimistic about Martinez\u2019s ability to slide back into the playoff race.\n\nThe race is getting tighter. The Nationals entered Tuesday a half-game ahead of the Chicago Cubs for the National League\u2019s top wild-card spot. They were only 1\u00bd games up on the Milwaukee Brewers to play in the wild-card game at all. That\u2019s a stark difference from where they were at the start of September, coasting into the postseason, capping a three-month stretch of being one of the majors\u2019 best teams. Now their short-term future is much more fragile.\n\nAnd they want their manager back as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s feeling much better, and the doctor said that as soon as he is good to travel he can rejoin us,\u201d Rizzo noted. \"And once he does rejoin us, he will be full-go, no limitations, 100 percent, hopefully for a long time. For the rest of this season, for a long time.\u201d\n\nTUESDAY\u2019S LINEUPS\n\nNationals (82-67)\n\nTrea Turner SS\n\nAdam Eaton RF\n\nAnthony Rendon 3B\n\nJuan Soto LF\n\nHowie Kendrick 1B\n\nAsdr\u00fabal Cabrera 2B\n\nVictor Robles CF\n\nYan Gomes C\n\nPatrick Corbin P\n\nCardinals (84-66)\n\nDexter Fowler RF\n\nKolten Wong 2B\n\nPaul Goldschmidt 1B\n\nMarcell Ozuna LF\n\nPaul DeJong SS\n\nYadier Molina C\n\nTommy Edman 3B\n\nHarrison Bader CF\n\nMiles Mikolas P\n\nRead more on the Nationals:\n\nAnalysis: How the NL Central race could benefit the Nationals\u2019 postseason push\n\nThe Nationals are learning how fast things can change in a wild-card race\n\nThomas Boswell: The Nats\u2019 bullpen will be better in October \u2014 if they make it that far", "description": "The manager will rejoin the team when he's cleared to travel, and that could be as soon as this weekend's series in Miami.", "authors": ["Jesse Dougherty", "Reporter Covering The Washington Nationals.", "September At Pm", "Jesse Dougherty Covers The Washington Nationals."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/0Fav8OmJptIseyhRyOJ6geqP1sc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6RD4RNVNSII6TFARUYEPTUGC2M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
