We also have a contract with an armored-car delivery company that can be used on higher-valued watches.\u201d\n\nIn this instance, after the woman searched for vintage Rolex dealers online and did her due diligence on Bob\u2019s Watches, Altieri sent one of his watch experts to her in Canada to determine her watch\u2019s authenticity and value. It ended up paying off.\n\n\u201cThere have been a few vintage Rolex Daytona collectors who have reached out to me, since all this media coverage, to ask if they could purchase the timepiece. But for right now, I plan to keep it in my personal collection,\u201d Altieri said. \u201cVintage Rolex \u2018Paul Newman\u2019 Daytona models have been terrific investments these past five years. The preowned-Rolex market is booming.\u201d\n\nThe watch-resale expert said that timepieces of the Daytona 6241 model the woman found are valued at $200,000 to $350,000, depending on the watch\u2019s condition and other variables.\n\n\u2018Couch watch\u2019 is hardly the first or only wild story Altieri has encountered\n\nAltieri said almost 100% of Bob\u2019s Watches purchases \u201ccome straight from the owners and/or the families,\u201d unlike the majority of luxury-watch dealers \u201cwho trade amongst themselves.\u201d\n\nAnother of the CEO\u2019s favorite found-watch stories involves a 14-year-old boy stumbling upon a Rolex \u2013 one that Altieri also ended up keeping for his personal collection.\n\n\u201cA 14-year-old boy caddying at Pebble Beach 40 years ago discovered an old Rolex lying in the fairway grass. He picked it up and turned it over to the pro shop at the end of the day. Two weeks later, the boy is given the unclaimed watch, which he wears for a few weeks \u2013 until he discovered that he liked his brother\u2019s eight-track cassette player better, so he traded it,\u201d Altieri recalled.\n\n\u201cA year or so later, after his older brother realized that his younger brother might have gotten the short end of the stick, the older brother proposed to trade it back to him for his new skateboard,\u201d he continued. \u201cForty years later, he read about me and my personal collection and wanted me to have it so he could create a college fund for his grandson. I valued the watch at $100,000 and paid him in full for it. I still have the watch today.\u201d", "description": "Business Insider - Bob's Watches CEO Paul Altieri wrote in September about a client finding a pricey watch.
