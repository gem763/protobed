Wimbledon\n\nAs the only club not to exist (at least in the guise in which they played in the Premier League) this is a fairly obvious choice for bottom spot.\n\n48. Bolton Wanderers\n\n(Image: ProSports/REX)\n\nA club who've been through utter turmoil. Have spent 13 seasons in the Premier League but now sit bottom of League One on -8 points and will almost certainly drop into the fourth tier.\n\n47. Bradford City\n\nA big football club who should at least be playing in the Championship. They haven't competed in the second tier since 2003-04 and are currently in League Two. Grim times for the Bantams.\n\n46. Sunderland\n\nHave played in 16 Premier League seasons but are now in their second successive campaign in the third tier and eight points off the title pace after 11 games. Phil Parkinson the latest man tasked with turning them around.\n\n45. Coventry City\n\nA Premier League mainstay in the 1990s - they featured in the competition's first nine seasons. But they've not been back since and are in their eighth consecutive campaign outside the top two divisions. Playing outside of their own city for the second time in a few years to boot.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nThe only club that could feature so low on this list while sitting 12th in the Premier League. Probably the biggest club in the country but in the midst of their worst start to a season for 30 years. Not in the Champions League, two points clear of the relegation zone and 15 points off the title pace after only eight games. A very low ebb.\n\n43. Ipswich Town\n\nCould arguably be lower in this list having dropped into the third tier for the first time since the 1956-57 season. But have started well and look in good shape to make an immediate return to the Championship.\n\n42. Portsmouth\n\nEnjoyed a seven-season stint in the top flight, which included an FA Cup triumph. Fell on hard times financially but are threatening a return to the second tier having won the EFL Trophy last term.\n\n41. Oldham Athletic\n\nPlayed the first two seasons of the Premier League but it's been downhill ever since. Dropped into League Two in 2018 and are currently languishing in 21st. Go through managers like socks. Chaotic boardroom.\n\n40. Stoke City\n\nEnjoyed a decade-long spell in the Premier League but have fallen on harder times since their relegation in 2018. Finished 16th in the second tier last season and are rock-bottom with only one win to their name this term. Bring back Rory Delap.\n\n39. Swindon Town\n\nAdmit it - you forgot they were in the Premier League. Played only the inaugural season. Have flitted between Leagues One and Two since the turn of the Millennium. Handily placed in a playoff spot in the fourth tier currently.\n\n38. Leeds United\n\n(Image: CameraSport via Getty Images)\n\nHave been out of the top flight for so long you could hardly argue they belong there - but still a stupendously big football club. Threatening a return to the big time under Marcelo Bielsa but remain in the Championship for now.\n\n37. Newcastle United\n\nSeemingly go from one crisis to another under Mike Ashley. Swapped Rafa Benitez for Steve Bruce. Have had two recent stints in the second tier and look set to be fighting off a third this term.\n\n36. Blackpool\n\nEnjoyed a fairytale, solitary Premier League campaign in 2009-10 but couldn't quite survive. Finally rid of the Oyston ownership after seasons of protests and boycotts. Tumbled into League Two in a stark decline but currently in the playoff spots in League One.\n\n35. Sheffield Wednesday\n\nWere Premier League ever-presents until relegation at the turn of the Millennium but have only once threatened a return. Could go top of the Championship with victory at Cardiff on Friday.\n\n34. Blackburn Rovers\n\nOnly went and bloody won the thing in 1995. But expectations have since waned dramatically. Sit in mid-table in their second season back in the Championship following relegation to League One.\n\n33. Birmingham City\n\nHave only managed to finish higher than 10th once in the second tier since their most recent relegation in 2011. Don't look like threatening a return this time around either.\n\n32. Middlesbrough\n\nHad an 11-year unbroken top-flight spell between 1998 and 2009 but have failed to sustain a Premier League place since. Struggling in the Championship after a tough start to life under Jonatahan Woodgate.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nPerhaps harsh for a club that has been ever-present in the Premier League but recent investment should have them pushing for Europe - not sitting in the bottom three after eight games and on the brink of yet another manager.\n\n30. Nottingham Forest\n\nLong gone are the days of back-to-back European Cups. But still a club that should have tasted top-flight football since 1999. Sit second after a solid start this time around - could it be their year?\n\n29. Derby County\n\nHaven't played in the Premier League since that god awful season in 2007-08. Perennial bridesmaids since then. Phillip Cocu the latest man to try and get them up but hasn't got off to the best of starts.\n\n28. Charlton Athletic\n\nBack in the Championship after three years away. Have made an impressive start but a first top-flight berth since 2007 may be a bit much to ask.\n\n27. Reading\n\nSpent three seasons in the Premier League and lost the playoff final under Jaap Stam in 2017 - but things have begun to unravel since. Back-to-back 20th-placed finishes and they currently sit in the bottom three having sacked Jose Gomes. Mark Bowen has since appointed himself the successor. Fair to say fans aren't convinced.\n\n26. Huddersfield Town\n\nHave made a dreadful start to life back in the second tier but still very much in credit for two Premier League campaigns that precisely no-one expected. Under a progressive manager in Danny Cowley who will be looking to get them up the table sharpish.\n\n25. Cardiff City\n\nHave only managed two one-season spells in the top flight. Haven't torn it up since being relegated back to the Championship last season. Mid-table under 70-year-old Neil Warnock.\n\n24. Hull City\n\nFailed to finish in the top half of the Championship since most recent relegation to second tier in 2017. Fans very disillusioned with owners. A top-flight return looks a long shot this season.\n\n23. Queens Park Rangers\n\nFounder members who have had two further spells in the Premier League since their first relegation in 2006. Very much a lower mid-table Championship club in recent years. Will be looking for progression this term.\n\n22. Wigan Athletic\n\nThe Premier League's perennial great escapees in an unbroken eight-year spell between 2005 and 2013. But have dropped into League One twice since and Championship should be seen their more natural level.\n\n21. Barnsley\n\nDanny Wilson led the Tykes to a solitary Premier League campaign in 1997-98. Bounced straight back to the Championship last season but have only one win this term and have sacked manager Daniel Stendel.\n\n20. West Bromwich Albion\n\n(Image: EMPICS Sport)\n\nOne of the yo-yo teams of the Premier league era. Sit top of the Championship after playoff disappointment last term.\n\nRight in the mix after 11 games following relegation to the Championship last season. Free-scoring under Scott Parker. Had a 13-year unbroken Premier League stint between 2001 and 2014.\n\n18. Swansea City\n\nMade a very decent start under Steve Cooper and look a good bet to be in the shake-up come May. Their seven-year Premier League spell also saw them win a first major honour with the League Cup in 2013.\n\n17. Watford\n\nRock-bottom and winless in eight games having already sacked their boss and brought back Quique Flores. Thankfully for them there is plenty of time to prolong their longest Premier League spell which is in its fifth term.\n\n16. Norwich City\n\nWill have a big job on to stay up in their fifth Premier League spell. Beat Man City but got hammered by Villa last time out.\n\nPlayed the first 13 Premier League seasons and have not dropped out since returning in 2012 but have fought off the drop in the last two campaigns and look set to have another battle on their hands this term.\n\n14. West Ham United\n\nPlaying some decent stuff under Manuel Pellegrini but still got a dodgy result in them. A top-half finish should be more than attainable.\n\n13. Aston Villa\n\nBack in the top flight after three years away. Slow-ish start but great result last time out and should have enough to stay up.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nNo title since 2004 and their third successive season out of the Champions League - but signs the Gunners are starting to turn the corner under Unai Emery. A top-four finish should be attainable this time.\n\nThe Eagles are flying high in sixth after four wins and two draws in their first eight games. Had never lasted more than one Premier League season before their current spell but are now enjoying their seventh successive top-flight campaign.\n\n10. Brighton and Hove Albion\n\nGreat times to be a Brighton fan. A third consecutive year in the top flight in one of the best new stadiums in the country. Will be looking for a more comfortable top-flight survival this term.\n\n9. Sheffield United\n\nThe Blades are back in the big time after two promotions in three seasons under a terrific manager in Chris Wilder and are making a decent fist of things with their fancy centre-backs. Just don't mention Carlos Tevez.\n\nWell on their way to establishing themselves as a Premier League club in their fourth consecutive top-flight campaign. Manager allegedly eats worms.\n\nWill be looking for some continuity under club legend Frank Lampard after a turbulent few years - although it hasn't been without success. Should be looking to finish best of the rest outside the top two.\n\n6. Leicester City\n\nIt still mashes my head that Leicester won the league. In the top four in the early stages of this campaign and have every chance of breaking the top-six monopoly under the Brodge.\n\n5. AFC Bournemouth\n\nYes, they have financial backing, but for a club of Bournemouth's size to continue doing what they are in the Premier League is nothing short of exceptional. Had never even played in the second tier until 2013. Play the 'right' way under Eddie Howe.\n\n4. Tottenham Hotspur\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nDodgy start this season but in the Champions League for the fourth campaign in a row and got all the way to the final last term. Could do with some clarity over the managerial situation.\n\n3. Wolverhampton Wanderers\n\nRemarkable rise under their current owners. Playing European football for the first time since the early 80s. Bit of a slow start but beat Man City last time out and shouldn't think the top six is out of reach.\n\nFour titles in the last eight years and playing some of the best football the Premier League has ever see under Pep Guardiola. But have already lost twice this term and have it all to do to catch Liverpool.\n\nEven for a club of the Reds' size - they are performing unbelievably. Perfect through eight games of the Premier League and European champions to boot. Surely the year they break their title drought under Jurgen Klopp. Surely.", "description": "Some are punching above their weight, others are performing really, really badly", "authors": ["James Whaling", "Image", "Prosports Rex", "Reuters", "Camerasport Via Getty Images", "Getty Images", "Empics Sport"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20577723.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Newcastle-United-v-Manchester-United.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
