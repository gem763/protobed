REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo\n\nThe fourth debate in the race to find a challenger to Trump in the November 2020 election will also match Biden and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren for the first time since Warren surged into a virtual tie with the former vice president in many Democratic opinion polls.\n\nThe debate marks the return of U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, 78, the oldest candidate in the field, who suffered a heart attack two weeks ago and has been recuperating at home in Vermont since having stents inserted to open a blocked artery.\n\nThe dozen candidates cramming the debate stage in the electoral battleground state of Ohio will make for the most crowded debate so far in the Democratic race.\n\nThe 10 candidates who took part in last month\u2019s third debate in Texas all qualified for Tuesday\u2019s event, along with U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard and Tom Steyer, a billionaire activist who is making his first debate appearance.\n\nThe packed stage and tangle of competing story lines could create a contentious atmosphere, and the Democratic-led congressional impeachment inquiry is likely to be a frequent theme.\n\nThe impeachment probe focuses on Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his unsubstantiated allegation that Biden improperly tried to aid his son Hunter\u2019s business interests in Ukraine. Trump has repeatedly tried to turn the focus on Biden with vociferous attacks on his integrity.\n\nEvery Democratic candidate has voiced support for the impeachment inquiry. The debate will be Biden\u2019s first chance to fire back at Trump before a national audience.\n\nIt also will give Biden\u2019s rivals a chance to offer their support - or not. They will be closely watched to see how they talk about the issue and whether any of them use it as an opportunity to attack Biden.\n\nWARREN A TARGET?\n\nBiden has seen his once solid lead in opinion polls in the Democratic race diminished by Warren, a leader of the party\u2019s progressive movement, who has steadily risen over the past two months.\n\nThe two candidates have mostly refrained from directly attacking each other. But Warren\u2019s gains could make her more of a target this time, particularly for other contenders who are running out of time to make an impression.\n\n\u201cWarren tends to recede with so many people on the stage and that has been working for her,\u201d said Alan Schroeder, a professor emeritus and debate expert at Northeastern University in Boston. \u201cBut the other candidates will have an incentive to try to halt her rise this time.\u201d\n\nBiden recently took a swipe at Warren\u2019s extensive \u201cI have a plan for that\u201d campaign promises, telling a New Hampshire crowd last week: \u201cThat\u2019s not enough. It takes proven ability to get things done. We\u2019re not electing a planner.\u201d\n\nEven Sanders, Warren\u2019s friend and progressive ally who has dropped into third place in the polls, signaled he was willing to draw at least some policy distinctions with her.\n\n\u201cThere are differences between Elizabeth and myself,\u201d Sanders, a democratic socialist, said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d program on Sunday, highlighting what he said was his more fervent opposition to corporate greed and corruption.\n\n\u201cElizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I\u2019m not,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nSanders will be watched closely in the debate for signs of fatigue or weakness after his heart attack, which highlighted his age and that of the other top White House contenders - Biden is 76 and Warren is 70, while Trump is 73 - in a race featuring a debate about a generational change in leadership.\n\nYounger Democratic candidates, including Pete Buttigieg, 37, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and entrepreneur Andrew Yang, 44, have argued it is time for new leadership in a Democratic Party driven by the diverse, grassroots energy of younger activists.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe Democratic National Committee again will increase the fundraising and polling criteria to qualify for next month\u2019s debate in Georgia. So far, only eight of the 12 candidates participating in Ohio would qualify, according to a CNN analysis. Nineteen contenders remain in the Democratic race overall.\n\nAlso participating in the Ohio debate will be U.S. Senators Cory Booker, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar, former U.S. Housing Secretary Julian Castro and former U.S. Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke.\n\nThe first Democratic nominating contest in Iowa is scheduled for Feb. 3.", "description": "Twelve top White House contenders will take part on Tuesday in the first Democratic debate since the launch of an impeachment inquiry into Republican President Donald Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate leading rival Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Trevor Hunnicutt", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441063137&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0NX", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
