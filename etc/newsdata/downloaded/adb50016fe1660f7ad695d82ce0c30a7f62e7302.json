General Assembly Wednesday. It also came a day after President Trump suggested in his own U.N. speech that he was preparing to increase pressure on Iran in the wake of the Sept. 14 attacks against Saudi oil infrastructure \u2014 attacks that U.S., Saudi and European officials all have blamed on Iran.\n\nThe Trump administration began ramping up economic pressure against Iran and companies doing business with the Islamic pressure last year after pulling the United States out of the 2015 Iranian nuclear accord.\n\nThe embargo on Iranian crude oil has been at the center of the effort. But some in the U.S. national security community have argued the effort is pointless unless Washington goes after Chinese firms believed to be avoiding the embargo and getting away with it.\n\nThe administration responded to that criticism in July by announcing sanctions against the Chinese state-run energy company Zhuhai Zhenrong Co Ltd. At the time, administration officials said Zhuhai Zhenrong\u2019s chief executive officer was also banned from entering the United States.\n\nThe list published Wednesday by the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) was significantly wider in scope.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
