It wanders down paths expected and otherwise, while the other moves like an arrow. \u201cThe Voter\u201d had something to say, \u201cAssassination\u201d has a yarn to spin. But the pair also have much in common. They share an energy and intricacy that can only result from great structure and smart, purposeful writing. Both take some big swings creatively, but there\u2019s none of that tonal whiplash that made some of those early hours frustrating.\n\nOne last common element: Both make only the occasional misstep. \u201cThe Voter\u201d is nearly perfect, but it\u2019s also got half the runtime and about one-fifth the storylines in which to go wide. This episode makes more mistakes, but it\u2019s still a big, big improvement, anchored by a bunch of terrific performances and some fun, weird surprises.\n\nIt begins with a hell of a twist \u2014 one that gets twisted again later. Some polling model convinces Payton that his victory is assured, and he skips writing a concession speech. So when Astrid shows up, the safe bet is that she\u2019s there to inform him that he\u2019s lost. Instead, she cuts him off at the knees by revealing she\u2019s bowed out of the election and the votes will never be counted. It\u2019s a great scene. He wins by default, and he won\u2019t be able to get anything done \u2014 or truly say he won. A \u201cpyrrhic victory,\u201d McAfee notes. Soon he\u2019s tanking in front of a school board as disinterested and sometimes silly as the Pawnee City Council, watching Dr. Pimple Popper with his mother and a pizza, and eventually reeling from the revelation that both he and Astrid were wrong \u2014 she won by two votes. \u201cYou\u2019re not Barack Obama,\u201d the publicly affable, privately disdainful school-board president tells him. \u201cYou\u2019re Gerald Ford.\u201d\n\nSo he looks elsewhere for joy and satisfaction. He begins by making amends, and a friend in the process. And those friends decide to do a musical.\n\nThe Politician doing Assassins is very on the nose, but it\u2019s a good kind of on the nose. It helps that Payton and Infinity are very well-cast in the roles of John Hinckley and Squeaky Fromme. (Naturally that means Ben Platt and Zoey Deutch are as well, though as long as he\u2019s singing it\u2019s hard to imagine Platt being miscast in any musical, provided it\u2019s in his range. The Phantom? Sure! Valjean? Why not? Rum Tum Tugger? I mean, if you must. Let the man play Momma Rose, I\u2019m good with it.) And it seems likely to be a blissful experience for both, save three things: Ricardo joins the cast, Payton can\u2019t stop watching footage of the Reagan assassination attempt, and people keep trying to kill him.\n\nThat\u2019s something he and Infinity have in common, though at this point the latter\u2019s health is really on the mend. So, despite some questionable choices, is her life. She\u2019s out of Dusty\u2019s home, staying in a hotel she\u2019s blackmailing Ray for (he just likes dressing up like a clown to cheer the kids!), and eating nothing but macarons. And that prompts Dusty, who now must provide a first-class trip to Paris in order to get Infinity to her funeral, to reach out to an unlikely ally.\n\nAs Ricardo, Benjamin Barrett has two good scenes in this episode. He\u2019s great as he listens to Dusty tell the story of Infinity\u2019s mother (a series-best scene from Jessica Lange, just spellbinding), and he expertly handles the unexpected turn in his final scene. So he\u2019s capable of good, even great things. Now just imagine how much better all his other scenes might be if he weren\u2019t written like a cartoon character. It is possible to write a guy who\u2019s a dolt but not a cartoon, even possible to make him likable as he does stupid, selfish, and dangerous things. In fact, it almost seems as if the writers are attempting to imitate just such a character: The Good Place\u2019s Jason Mendoza. But Jason Mendoza is a fully developed character, and Ricardo is a sketch at best, with maybe four scenes in total so far in which he\u2019s got any shading at all (the two above, his last scene with Astrid in the New York motel, and that menacing home invasion). So when he tanks his scene in rehearsal, it seems like bad sketch comedy, not a person doing their best.\n\nStill, if getting him in the rehearsal room was the price that had to be paid in order for that last, genuinely shocking reveal, then I suppose it was worth paying.\n\nOf course, I could be wrong and there could be a reason the character\u2019s drawn that way. After all, I was wrong about the episode-four scene in which Payton told Infinity about the poisoning. That becomes obvious in two places. The first is when he apologizes for treating her as a political problem and not a person, which was my exact complaint \u2014 specifically, that Payton always shows at least a flash of humanity, and he didn\u2019t there. (I stand by part of that, though; I think Platt is just such a vulnerable performer that sometimes it creeps through when it might not be intended.) The second one is more interesting, in that Payton clarifies why the Infinity cover-up is so bad. It\u2019s not that they knew it wasn\u2019t cancer and didn\u2019t tell the voters. It\u2019s that they knew and didn\u2019t tell her.\n\nMy mistake there was assuming that Payton was thinking about how it would look that he had known she was lying \u2014 he did keep saying she was faking it. But in this episode, he makes a clarification, and it is a killer: \u201cAnd we opted not to tell her.\u201d That\u2019s messed up. More messed up than making his best friends sign NDAs. More messed up than Skye gaslighting her girlfriend about the poison she put in the cupcakes. Not as messed up as the poisoned cupcakes or the sepsis BBs, but pretty messed up all the same.\n\nAs mentioned above, these assassination attempts might make Assassins feel pretty on the nose, but would you really change anything? It would mean losing \u201cUnworthy of your Love,\u201d beautifully sung as Georgina packs to leave her husband and take away her son\u2019s chance at that inheritance, and as Dusty dotes over pictures of her absent grandchild. It means losing Payton channeling his feelings of inadequacy into the song, and losing Infinity singing \u201cLet me drink poison!\u201d with joy. What a great scene. Who would ever trade it?\n\nTalking Points\n\n\u2022 Written by Ian Brennan and directed by Gwyneth Horder-Payton; those shots of Lange dancing to Shirley Bassey are gorgeous, as is that plane taking off. A real stunner of an episode.\n\n\u2022 The best part in the show is neither John Hinckley nor Squeaky Fromme. The best part of the show is Charles Guiteau. But there are no bad parts in Assassins.\n\n\u2022 \u201cBesides, we just got so much free stuff.\u201d \u201cWho could be poisoning that little girl \u2026 against me?\u201d That Munchausen storyline is all kinds of mess, but Lange\u2019s monologue is one of the best pieces of acting of the whole year so far.\n\n\u2022 Rahne Jones makes Skye such a good liar that I was genuinely shocked when the camera cut to her destroying the evidence. She\u2019s terrific.\n\n\u2022 Costume of the episode: Tough to pick! Dusty\u2019s flashback suit was great, but Infinity\u2019s Squeaky costume is just perfect. Her cap makes the outfit look even more cult-ready.\n\n\u2022 \u201cTough titties, Nana!\u201d", "description": "The Politician doing Assassins is very on the nose, but it\u2019s a good kind of on the nose.
