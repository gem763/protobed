Many of its components have seen strong year-to-date gains, with utility American Water Works Inc. AWK, -0.75% up 36%, water-technology provider Xylem Inc. XYL, +3.63% up 17%, and conglomerate Danaher Corp. DHR, +0.81% up 36% in Friday dealings. The Invesco Water Resources exchange-traded fund PHO, +2.25% trades 29% higher for the year so far.\n\nWater is an \u201cessential part of our daily lives,\u201d observes Christopher Muir, an equity analyst at CFRA Research, pointing out that it\u2019s used in everything from drinking, ice-making, cooking, and cleaning to cooling, firefighting, and electric-power generation. Even so, water is quite cheap\u2014at least in the U.S. The average 2018 residential rate for American Water Works across its various municipalities was $9.62 per 1,000 gallons, while the average commercial rate was $7.46, according to Muir.\n\nHowever, Deane Dray, a multi-industry analyst at RBC Capital Markets, points out that in certain markets, including some in the U.S., governments \u201cand municipalities are heavily subsidizing the water for consumers.\u201d In other countries, water is \u201cmore fairly priced,\u201d adds Dray. For instance, in Switzerland, water prices are about four times those in the U.S.\u2014not because it costs that much more to produce clean water, but because it isn\u2019t heavily subsidized.\n\nDray says that, even in countries like China, \u201cwhere consumer and commercial spending is decelerating, you are still seeing healthy investment in water quality and safety.\u201d Improved water quality and availability are among the top mandates in Beijing\u2019s five-year plan for economic growth. \u201cAs such, water companies have largely outperformed their industrial peers, and investors are taking notice,\u201d says Dray.\n\nHe points to Xylem as the \u201cpremier water-sector pure play, with a first- mover advantage in investing in disruptive digital solutions for water utilities.\u201d He cites AquaVenture Holdings Ltd. WAAS, +1.02%, which builds desalination and wastewater-treatment plants, as another leader.\n\nMuir, however, has a Sell rating on American Water Works, based on its valuation. It recently traded at 31.8 times CFRA Research\u2019s 2020 earnings-per-share estimate. That level is too high for the company\u2019s earnings growth rate and 1.6% dividend yield, he says.\n\nIn the developed world, we \u201ctake access to clean water for granted, but as [the contamination problem in Flint, Mich.] highlights, investments and stringent standards are needed to ensure this,\u201d says Hubert Aarts, co-head of listed equities at Impax Asset Management. \u201cInfrastructure needs to be updated and maintained, and standards need to rise.\u201d\n\nLondon-based Impax invests in three water-related areas: utilities, infrastructure, and treatment and efficiency, he says. Infrastructure includes companies that produce pumps, pipes, valves, and consultants, while treatment and efficiency includes companies making water meters and helping the industry use water more efficiently and manage waste. \u201cThere are a lot of ways to invest in water,\u201d Aarts adds.\n\n\u201cWater investment opportunities keep growing, and innovation is strong.\u201d However, for compliance reasons, he declined to discuss any individual stocks.", "description": "At about a penny a gallon in many places, water might be difficult to think of as a good investment, but stocks and exchange-traded funds related to it have...", "authors": ["Myra P.
