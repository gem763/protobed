He has let down the millions of people in this country who absolutely passionately want to remain in the EU.\n\n\u201cWhat waiting would do is risk no-deal, because if we waste this extension and we end up in January with that 31st of January deadline looming, assuming it is granted today, and we haven't done anything with this time, then there\u2019s no guarantee the EU will extend again and then no deal is back on the table.\u201d", "description": "EU ambassadors have agreed on a three-month\u00a0Brexit extension until 31 January\u00a02020\u00a0\u2013\u00a0killing off Boris Johnson\u2019s pledge to deliver the UK\u2019s exit from the bloc by Halloween.
