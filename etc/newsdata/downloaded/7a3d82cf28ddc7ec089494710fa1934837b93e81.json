The cash will be used to support renewable energy projects.\n\nRHE posted a \u00a3107,000 pre-tax loss in its latest accounts. Last week, the council agreed to lend the business \u00a39.4million so it could settle with Ofgem in full by the deadline. The company will repay the loan over the next six months at 'a state aid compliant rate of interest', a council spokesman said.\n\nRobin Hood Energy is owned by Labour-run Nottingham City Council\n\nRHE blamed its financial woes on uncertainty over Brexit coupled with 14 unscheduled payments to Ofgem in the past 18 months to help cover the cost of other suppliers going bust or not paying their bills.\n\nGnERGY and Delta Gas and Power have to pay renewable energy charges of \u00a3637,876 and \u00a391,937 respectively to Ofgem by Thursday. A fourth firm \u2013 Toto Energy \u2013 owed \u00a34.55million and went bust last week.\n\nEnergy analysts are predicting a wave of other suppliers going out of business over the winter. One source blamed Ofgem's 'laid-back' regulation.\n\nPeter Earl, head of energy at price comparison site CompareTheMarket, said: 'Based on current trends, we expect one energy supplier will fail each month over the next 12 months.'\n\nSome 21 energy firms have exited the market over the past three years, including Spark Energy, Brilliant Energy and Solarplicity.\n\nLast week, Ofgem set out plans to 'reduce the risk of supplier failure' by introducing tough new checks on existing energy companies. It tightened up the rules for new suppliers during the summer.", "description": "Jeremy Corbyn's energy supplier, Robin Hood Energy, has secured an emergency \u00a39.4million loan to stay in business.", "authors": ["Harriet Dennys For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
