Reeker testified he heard resistance to releasing the aid was coming from acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, one of the sources said.\n\nAt the end of Saturday\u2019s session, Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff told reporters lawmakers were making \u201crapid progress\u201d in the impeachment inquiry. He declined to say when the panels might advance to the next phase of hearings open to the public.\n\nThe Democratic-led committees are conducting an inquiry focusing on Trump\u2019s request to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that he investigate former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, and his son Hunter Biden, who had served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nU.S. election law prohibits candidates from accepting foreign help in an election.\n\nAs part of their probe, the lawmakers are examining whether Trump withheld $391 million in security assistance until Zelenskiy publicly committed to both an investigation of the Bidens and a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine - not Russia - meddled in the U.S. 2016 presidential election.\n\nDemocrats emerging from the session said Reeker\u2019s deposition corroborated previous testimony taken by the panels.\n\nBut they offered no details and it was not clear what Reeker may have corroborated.\n\nRepresentative Stephen Lynch told reporters that Reeker, whose portfolio includes Ukraine and Russia, was a \u201cmuch richer reservoir of information than we originally expected.\u201d\n\nBut Reeker, according to the sources, was largely out of the loop on policy toward Ukraine, leaving it to Kurt Volker, then the U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations, and others.\n\nRepublican Representative Mark Meadows, speaking to reporters as a long day of testimony was winding down, said it \u201cwas a good day for the president\u201d and described Reeker as \u201ca top level official not giving any potential incriminating evidence.\u201d\n\nPhilip Reeker, acting assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs, is escorted by police officers as he leaves after testifying in impeachment inquiry against U.S. President Donald Trump, in Washington D.C. , U.S., October 26, 2019. REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko\n\nFOCUS ON UKRAINE\n\nReeker submitted to questioning in response to a congressional subpoena issued after the State Department attempted to block his testimony, according to an official working on the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe testimony was the first since a federal judge on Friday rejected a claim by Trump and his Republican allies that the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry process was illegitimate because the full House had not voted to authorize it. [nL2N27A1DV]\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched the formal Trump probe on Sept. 24 under her broad powers as speaker.\n\nAt the heart of the inquiry is a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate the Bidens and a claim - debunked as a conspiracy theory - that a Democratic National Committee computer server was in Ukraine.\n\nWilliam Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, testified on Tuesday that Trump made the withheld aid contingent on Zelenskiy announcing the requested investigations.\n\nTrump denies wrongdoing and, backed by his fellow Republicans in Congress, insists he is being treated unfairly.\n\nReeker, 54, a career diplomat, is the latest in a growing list of current and former officials who have met with investigators.\n\nAmong the issues the committees explored with Reeker was Trump\u2019s abrupt dismissal in May of the ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. According to emails given to congressional committees this month, Reeker sought to intervene when Trump supporters accused Yovanovitch of being disloyal to the president.\n\nReeker sought a stronger State Department defense of Yovanovitch that was never provided, according to the two sources.\n\nThe committees have scheduled several depositions for next week, all behind closed doors.\n\nCharles Kupperman, a former deputy national security adviser to Trump, who was called to appear on Monday, has asked a court whether he should comply with a congressional subpoena or honor the administration\u2019s instruction not to testify.\n\nThe Democrats leading the inquiry said on Saturday their subpoena was valid and they expected him to appear.\n\nSlideshow (11 Images)\n\nOn Tuesday, lawmakers hope to hear from Alexander Vindman, the White House National Security Council\u2019s top Ukraine expert.\n\nKathryn Wheelbarger, acting assistant secretary of defense for international security, is scheduled to appear on Wednesday, and Tim Morrison, a top White House adviser on Russia and Europe, is scheduled for Thursday.", "description": "A senior U.S. diplomat told lawmakers on Saturday he did not know whether President Donald Trump had withheld aid for Ukraine to force an investigation of a political rival, two sources said, even as Democrats said he corroborated evidence gathered in their impeachment probe.", "authors": ["Arshad Mohammed", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445368653&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q00P", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
