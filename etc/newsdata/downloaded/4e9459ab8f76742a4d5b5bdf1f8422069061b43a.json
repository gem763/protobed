The group beheaded seven American, British and Japanese journalists, and aid workers and a group of Syrian soldiers, boasting of the butchery in videos released to the world.\n\nTURKEY'S LEADER WARNS OF FLOODING EUROPE WITH SYRIAN REFUGEES IF EU CALLS ASSAULT AN 'INVASION'\n\nThe two British men were captured in January last year in eastern Syria by the Kurdish forces amid the collapse of ISIS. Their detention set off a debate in the U.S. and Europe over how to prosecute their citizens who joined ISIS.\n\nISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared a so-called caliphate in 2014 in large parts of Syria and Iraq that the extremists controlled. But ISIS was defeated in Iraq in 2017 and in March the SDF captured the last sliver of land that was held by the fighters in Syria.\n\nThe SDF has handed over hundreds of ISIS fighters to Iraqi authorities over the past two years, including Europeans, while some were repatriated to their home countries.\n\nEarlier this year, Iraq tried 12 French ISIS fighters whom the SDF handed over to Baghdad in January, sentencing most of them to death.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nFrance at the time said the Iraqi court has jurisdiction to rule in the cases, though a spokeswoman reiterated the French government's opposition to the death penalty.\n\nPresident Trump and other U.S. officials have repeatedly pressed other nations across Europe and the Middle East to take back the detainees from their countries. But international leaders have been largely reluctant and have been slow to take any back.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Around 50 Islamic State fighters that the U.S. removed from Syria in recent days amidst a Turkish military assault are headed to Iraq, officials there say.", "authors": ["Greg Norman"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/turkey-tank.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
