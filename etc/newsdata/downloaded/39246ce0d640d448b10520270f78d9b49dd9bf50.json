The game, if you are not familiar, allows you to control a horrible goose, who terrorises a village in order to pursue a list of arbitrary goals. Obviously, I do not expect this goose to be representative of the entire goose community \u2014 largely because it is a fictional goose from a video game \u2014 but it has certainly made me more wary of the goose\u2019s iconic honk, a noise I had not previously believed to be sinister.\n\nAs you can imagine, this is not an ideal time for me to come across a report of a renegade goose launching itself through the window of a cab in the UK \u2014 exactly like the untitled goose in Untitled Goose Game would do. Nevertheless, according to Nottinghamshire Police, this is entirely real:\n\nWhen a colleague asked if a call had been received about a goose flying into a taxi over the radio, we had to see it to believe it. Goose was taken to the vets & unfortunately the taxi had to repair the damage.
