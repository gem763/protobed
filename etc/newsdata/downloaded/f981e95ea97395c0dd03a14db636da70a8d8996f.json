Sign up here.\n\nWhen a woman screamed that society should \u201cstart eating babies\u201d to fight climate change at town hall hosted by Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez this week, it seemed almost too strange to be real.\n\nTurns out, it was too strange to be real: The whole thing was a troll job from a far-right, fringe group.\n\nThe LaRouche PAC \u2014 a right-wing that supports Donald Trump and thinks climate change is a hoax \u2014 took credit for the odd outburst on Twitter late Thursday night. \u201cIt was us. Malthusianism isn't new, Jonathan Swift knew that. Sometimes, only satire works,\u201d the group wrote.\n\nThe moment at AOC\u2019s town hall on Thursday was captured by C-Span and, naturally, went viral. Toward the end of the event, the woman stood up and said she loved the Green New Deal but felt it didn\u2019t far enough.\n\n\"We got to start eating babies! We don't have enough time!\u201d she yelled out, while also wearing a t-shirt urging people to eat children\n\nAs the woman got increasingly worked up, Ocasio-Cortez tried to calm her down and told her \u201cit\u2019s OK.\u201d She then continued to talk about climate change and ignored the comments about babies.\n\nSeemingly unaware the woman was apparently working with a pro-Trump group, the Trump family was quick to jump on the moment as an opporunity to poke at AOC.\n\n\u201cSeems like a normal AOC supporter to me,\u201d Donald Trump Jr. posted.\n\n\u201cAOC is a Wack Job!\u201d added President Donald Trump.\n\nOcasio-Cortez had repeatedly urged this woman be treated with compassion because she may have been in crisis. Friday, the freshman Democrat tweeted a reaction to the news the woman worked with the LaRouche PAC.\n\n\u201cTurns out the woman yelling was a Trump supporter,\u201d the New York representative tweeted. \u201cDoesn\u2019t rule out potential mental issue (Drs do that) but good to know they were not in crisis. Earlier this year I was stalked & very nearly hurt by a disturbed person. I don\u2019t take chances & immediately try to de-escalate.\u201d\n\nThe LaRouche PAC was founded by Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr., the late conspiracy theorist who trafficked in anti-Semitism, homophobia, and racism. Matthew Sweet, who wrote a book about the group\u2019s history, described it as a \u201cbizarre political cult.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been doing this since the \u201970s,\u201d Sweet told the Washington Post. \u201cThe tactic is you go to a political meeting and you create a disturbance that disrupts the meeting, and more importantly, that creates a kind of chaos.\u201d\n\nCover image: Screenshot via video", "description": "The LaRouche PAC took credit for the Jonathan Swift-style trolling.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d975a63b58e170009372092/lede/1570200812485-Screen-Shot-2019-10-04-at-105241-AM.png?crop=0.9264xw:0.8328xh;0.0736xw,0.0961xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
