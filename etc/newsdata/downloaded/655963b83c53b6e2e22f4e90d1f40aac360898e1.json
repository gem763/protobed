It's unclear how willing the shareholders would be to assume more leverage to consummate the deal.\"\n\nA spokesperson for HKEX told CNBC via email that the company believes the proposed transaction would be highly compelling for LSEG shareholders, as well as for HKEX shareholders.\n\n\"HKEX intends to continue its dividend policy of paying regular dividends with a normal target pay-out ratio of 90% of the profits of the combined group. Also, HKEX intends to apply for a secondary listing of HKEX shares on the London Stock Exchange with effect from completion of the Proposed Transaction,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nHKEX proposed \u00a320.45 a share in cash, as well as 2.495 newly issued HKEX shares. It said the deal would be funded by a combination of existing cash and a new credit facility.\n\nIt cautioned, however, that its statement to the market should be considered an announcement to make a possible offer, rather than as confirmation of a firm intention to bid.\n\nAdditionally, Hong said that the HKEX would have to meet \"many conditions.\"\n\n\"It's a challenge for Charles, obviously,\" Hong said, referring to HKEX CEO Charles Li.", "description": "The Hong Kong stock exchange could find the London stock exchange \"potentially unaffordable,\" according to a chief strategist at Bank of Communications International.", "authors": ["Eustance Huang"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106083155-1565960652235gettyimages-992682118.jpeg?v=1568274070", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
