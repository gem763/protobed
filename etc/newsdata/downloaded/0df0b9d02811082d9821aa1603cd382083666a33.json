Researchers published the 'most up-to-date evidence on the topic', based on data from four million people. But the same scientists warned the evidence was so flimsy that people should not worry and carry on eating red meat at their current levels\n\nResults showed eating three servings less of unprocessed red meat each week was linked to a seven per cent lower risk of ever developing cancer.\n\nIt means if 1,000 people curbed back on how much they consumed, there would be seven less cases of any form of the killer disease.\n\nThe biggest reduction was for gastric or stomach cancer. Data showed eating three less servings was linked to a 14 per cent lower risk of the disease.\n\nThe researchers calculated this would lead to two fewer cases of stomach cancer, if 1,000 people scaled back on how much meat they ate.\n\nCOULD EATING THREE LESS SERVINGS OF RED MEAT EACH WEEK SLASH YOUR RISK OF KILLER CONDITIONS?

Lauren Wiggins, from Bowel Cancer UK, said: 'This research shows that current government recommendations to limit eating red meat to three portions a week, still stand. 'We know eating red and processed meat can increase your likelihood of developing bowel cancer. So it's important to cut down how much of this you're having.' Cancer Research UK's Emma Shields said: 'Processed meat increases the risk of bowel cancer \u2013 there's a mass of evidence that shows this. 'This research came to the same conclusion, the main difference being the researchers' view that eating less meat doesn't help very much.' Tracy Parker, senior dietitian at the British Heart Foundation, added: 'Studies like this make it confusing to know if you should pick up your steak knife or leave it in the drawer. 'How much red and processed meat we should be eating has been up for debate for decades, but our advice hasn't changed. 'Most of us could benefit from eating less meat and including more plant-based protein in our diets, such as lentils, nuts and seeds, as well as fruit, vegetables and wholegrains.'\n\nA similar reduction was seen for breast cancer (12 per cent), which would avoid six cases of the disease among a thousand people cutting back on meat.\n\nData also showed cutting back on unprocessed red meat was linked to a 10 per cent lower chance of getting type 2 diabetes in the next 11 years.\n\nConsuming three less servings also cut the odds of heart disease by five per cent, as well as six per cent for stroke and seven per cent for a heart attack.\n\nIn real terms, it means there six less cases of type 2 diabetes among 1,000 people who scaled back on how much red meat they ate over 11 years.\n\nThere would also be three less cases of heart disease or a heart attack, and one less stroke per the same amount of people and the same time frame.\n\nRisk reductions were even greater in a review of studies that compared high and low intake of red and processed meat.\n\nOfficials have for years tried to encourage diet changes \u2013 guidelines recommend people limit themselves to 2.5oz (70g) of red meat a day.\n\nThis is the equivalent of one lamb chop, one pork sausage, half a beef burger, or one-and-a-half rashers of bacon.\n\nBut the analysis, based on five reviews of past research, ruled that people should continue to eat the current average amount of red meat.\n\nThe panel of 14 experts from seven countries said this was between three and four portions per week for North Americans and Europeans.\n\nThe NHS recommends people limit themselves to 70g or less of red meat each day, because eating a lot of it 'probably increases your risk of bowel cancer'. 70g works out equal to about one lamb chop, one pork sausage, half a beef burger, or one-and-a-half rashers of bacon\n\nScientists from the Dalhousie and McMaster universities in Canada led the research, as well as the Cochrane research centres in Spain and Poland.\n\nIt considered 61 studies which had monitored the health of more than four million people, as well as 12 which trialled changing the diets of about 54,000.\n\nThe risks the analysis uncovered were similar to what has been suggested before - but the researchers ruled that the odds are not that big.\n\nThe team also found the results of past research were of too poor a quality to make any suggestions about the way people lived their lives.\n\nDiscussing his results, study author Dr Bradley Johnson of Dalhousie told the BBC: 'We're not saying there is no risk.\n\n'We're saying there is only low-certainty evidence of a very small reduction of cancer and other adverse health consequences of reducing red meat consumption.'\n\nIn an editorial published alongside the papers, Dr Aaron Carroll and Dr Tiffany Doherty, from Indiana University, wrote: 'The overall recommendations, contrary to almost all others that exist, suggested that adults continue to eat their current levels of red and processed meat, unless they felt inclined to change them themselves.\n\n'This is sure to be controversial, but it is based on the most comprehensive review of the evidence to date.\n\nCOULD A 'LOWER ADHERENCE TO DIETARY PATTERNS HIGH IN RED AND PROCESSED MEAT' REDUCE THE RISK OF KILLER CONDITIONS?

In fact, it does not find any good evidence at all.'\n\nKevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University, also praised the study, branding it an 'extremely comprehensive piece of work'.\n\nHowever, Professor Tim Key, from the University of Oxford, said: 'There's substantial evidence that processed meat can cause bowel cancer.'\n\nHe added: 'Today's new publication reports results essentially identical to the existing evidence.\n\n'But describes the impact very differently, contradicting the general consensus among cancer research experts.'\n\nDr Marco Springmann, an environment and health expert at Oxford, added that the recommendation was based on a 'skewed reading'.\n\nHe said: 'Even with this skewed way of presenting the evidence, the reviews clearly indicate the benefits of reducing red and processed meat consumption.'", "description": "Results of the analysis, led by 14 experts from seven countries, showed eating three servings less of unprocessed red meat each week was linked to a seven per cent lower risk of ever developing cancer.", "authors": ["Stephen Matthews Health Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/01/16/19161678-0-image-a-22_1569943300579.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
