Tyler Hofer and his climbing partner moved some rocks aside and discovered an entire skeleton. It appeared to have been there long enough that all that remained were bones, a leather belt and a pair of leather shoes.\n\nThe discovery a week ago beneath Mount Williamson unearthed a mystery: Who was the unfortunate hiker? How did he or she die? Did the person have a partner? Were they ever reported injured, dead or missing?\n\nThe Inyo County Sheriff\u2019s Department doesn\u2019t have any of those answers yet but retrieved the remains Wednesday in the hopes of finding the identity and what happened. There\u2019s no evidence to suggest foul play, spokeswoman Carma Roper told The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge mystery for us,\u201d Roper said.\n\nThe body was discovered Oct. 7 near a lake in the remote rock-filled bowl between the towering peaks of Mount Tyndall and Williamson, which rises to 14,374 feet (4,381 meters). The pair of climbers who discovered it phoned in their report once they got a cell phone signal and met with the sheriff\u2019s department the next day after hiking out, Sgt. Nate Derr said.\n\nHofer wrote about his \u201cpretty crazy\u201d discovery on Facebook and posted a photo taken next to where the skeleton was found.\n\n\u201cNeedless to say, we were a bit shocked,\u201d Hofer wrote.\n\nDerr, who coordinates the county\u2019s search and rescue team, said bodies found in the mountains are typically connected with someone they know who has gone missing. The opposite is rarer: finding the remains of someone that appears to not have gone missing or reported as missing.\n\nBecause the body was so decomposed, investigators believe it\u2019s possibly been there for decades.\n\nThey have ruled out that it\u2019s 1st Lt. Matthew Kraft, a Marine from Connecticut who vanished in February during a nearly 200-mile (320-kilometer) ski trek through the Sierra. Derr also doubts it\u2019s Matthew Greene, a Pennsylvania climber last seen in the Mammoth Lakes area - nearly 70 miles (112 kilometers) north - in 2013.\n\nThey\u2019ve gone back through decades of reports of people missing in the Inyo National Forest and come up empty, Derr said. Neighboring Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks also don\u2019t have reports of anyone missing in that area.\n\nThe death could have occurred in the days before helicopters were used to fly out bodies, Derr said. It\u2019s possible, he said that the person perished on the mountain and was buried by a climbing partner.\n\nAlthough the mountain is the state\u2019s second-highest, it\u2019s not summited as frequently as other high Sierra peaks because it is a forbidding approach. The elevation gain from the trailhead in the high desert to the summit is the greatest of any peak in California.\n\nIt can take more than a day to hike over Shepherd Pass and then the trail ends and climbers have to make a tedious scramble over rock fields and sand before climbing the final 2,000 feet (600 meters) up a chute that includes moments of breathtaking exposure picking their way up a rock face.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The climbers were on their way to the top of California's second-highest peak when they came upon the grisly discovery of what looked like a bone buried in a boulder field.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brian Melley"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/16/california-skeleton_mystery_93868_c0-30-1000-613_s1200x700.jpg?962e3d2077574f35c7782de3c34982d0d1e4d2ea", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
