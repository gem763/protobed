The deal also didn't remove any of the existing tariffs on Chinese imports,\" said Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM.\n\n\"If you're a U.S. or a Chinese business, such developments will not help deciding on your future plans. That's why I like to call the current agreement a trade truce rather than a trade deal.\"\n\nShares of online grocer Ocado (L: ) skidded 3.7%, as a pullback in Brexit optimism was compounded by a rating cut and bearish view from JP Morgan.\n\nRoyal Mail (L: ), relegated to the FTSE 250 earlier this year, slipped 4% after a report that the company was facing the threat of an employee strike over Christmas.", "description": "UK stocks recoil as Brexit euphoria cools; Sophos soars", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9D0J1_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
