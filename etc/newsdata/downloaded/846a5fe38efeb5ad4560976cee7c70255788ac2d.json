(Reuters) - A fast-moving wildfire threatened thousands of homes and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library outside Los Angeles on Wednesday as extraordinarily dry Santa Ana winds buffeted the region, forcing meteorologists to grasp for new language to warn of the danger.\n\nThe fire erupted in Ventura County\u2019s Simi Valley, about 30 miles (50 km) northwest of an earlier blaze that has been consuming the shrub-covered hills near the Getty Center museum in west Los Angeles since Monday, displacing thousands of residents from some of the city\u2019s priciest neighborhoods.\n\nThe Easy fire in Simi Valley quickly grew into the most consequential of several new blazes that sprang up around the region on Wednesday, prompting evacuations of an estimated 7,000 homes affecting about 26,000 people.\n\nIn Riverside County east of Los Angeles, a wind-driven brush fire swiftly charred 100 acres (40 hectares), forcing the evacuation of two mobile home parks, local fire officials said.\n\nFor firefighters, weather conditions could hardly be worse, with thick brush and chaparral left bone dry by lack of rain and low humidity, as fierce winds hurled flaming embers through the air to ignite spot fires ahead of advancing flames.\n\n\u201cThe fire outflanked us very rapidly today, pushed by those 40- to 50-mile-per-hour winds,\u201d Ventura County Fire Department assistant chief Chad Cook told reporters. \u201cWe did experience gusts up to 65 miles per hour this morning, which made long-range spotting very, very dangerous.\u201d\n\nCook said erratic, high winds also forced intermittent grounding of firefighting aircraft through the day.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued an unprecedented \u201cextreme red flag\u201d warning for wildfires in Los Angeles and Ventura counties ahead of two days of intense, dry wind gusts that were forecast to reach near-hurricane force.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever seen us use this warning,\u201d said forecaster Marc Chenard. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty bad.\u201d\n\nRelated Coverage Hungry goats help save California's Reagan library from wildfire\n\nStatewide, the weather service issued alerts for \u201ccritical\u201d or \u201cextreme\u201d fire hazards covering more than 34,000 square miles (88,000 square km), encompassing some 21 million people.\n\nHELICOPTERS AND PLANE TANKERS\n\nThe Easy fire in Simi Valley ignited just before dawn off a road named Easy Street and grew to 1,300 acres (530 hectares) by late morning, fanned westward by Santa Ana winds.\n\nOne wall of flames raced across scrub-covered slopes at the edge of the hilltop Reagan Library, which houses the late president\u2019s archives and memorabilia, including the Air Force One jet on which he flew.\n\nPre-positioned strike teams of firefighters, backed by water-dropping helicopters and airplane tankers dumping payloads of fire retardant, swarmed the area as flames closed in on the library campus.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re surrounded. It\u2019s a scary situation. But I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll get on top of it,\u201d John Heubusch, the library\u2019s executive director, said in an interview with KNX radio in Los Angeles. \u201cIt\u2019s as close as it gets.\u201d\n\nBy late morning, emergency crews had largely subdued flames, and the fire moved off in other directions.\n\n\u201cFire moved around the perimeter of the Reagan Library, and we had successful stands up there on protecting the library and the infrastructure around the facility,\u201d Cook said.\n\nOn numerous ranches nearby, residents in protective face masks scrambled to coax nervous horses and other livestock into trailers to drive them to safety.\n\nA helicopter drops water on a fire burning on a hillside near the Reagan Presidential library (at rear) in Simi Valley, California, U.S. October 30, 2019. REUTERS/Omar Younis\n\nThe fire prompted public schools and at least three college campuses in the area to cancel classes for the day.\n\nThe Santa Ana winds are a regional weather phenomenon that sends gusts westward off the desert to the east, through mountain passes and out to the Southern California coast. They were forecast to reach sustained speeds of 50 to 70 mph hour (80 to 110 km per hour) on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nELECTRIC HAZARDS, BLACKOUTS\n\nArson investigators say the Getty fire was likely caused by a broken tree branch blown into power lines during high winds on Monday morning. It spread, consuming 745 acres (300 hectares) by Wednesday morning, with about a quarter contained by firefighters. At least 12 homes have been destroyed.\n\nElectricity remained cut off to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses in northern and central California on Tuesday as a precaution by the state\u2019s largest utility, Pacific Gas and Electric Co, a unit of PG&E Corp (PCG.N).\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom has accused PG&E of failing to adequately modernize and safely maintain its power systems.\n\nIn northern California, firefighters struggled for a sixth day against the 76,000-acre (30,760-hectare) Kincade fire in Sonoma County\u2019s wine country. High-wind forecasts prompted PG&E to impose a new round of blackouts for nearly 600,000 homes and business on Tuesday.\n\nUtilities serving Southern California\u2019s more urban areas have imposed smaller-scale outages.\n\nPG&E acknowledged last week that the Kincade fire started near a damaged PG&E transmission tower at about the time a live high-voltage line carried by that tower malfunctioned.\n\nThe company filed for bankruptcy in January, citing $30 billion in potential liability from a series of deadly fires sparked by its equipment in 2017 and 2018.\n\nSlideshow (11 Images)\n\nAs many as 190,000 people were displaced at the height of evacuations from the Kincade fire, but authorities began allowing residents to return to their homes this week as firefighters gained a handle on the blaze.\n\nProperty losses from the Kincade, listed at 30% contained, were put at 189 homes and other structures, double Monday\u2019s tally.", "description": "A fast-moving wildfire threatened thousands of homes and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library outside Los Angeles on Wednesday as extraordinarily dry Santa Ana winds buffeted the region, forcing meteorologists to grasp for new language to warn of the danger.", "authors": ["Omar Younis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446639339&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T1RT", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
