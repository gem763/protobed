Sufferers face a daily fight for survival and many patients die before they reach their teens.\n\nWhen doctors confirmed Aaron had ROHHAD in January 2015, there was no test to diagnose it, little research into the illness and critically, there is no cure. Months after being diagnosed.\n\nAaron and his family founded the ROHHAD Association to raise awareness and money to fund research, as well as to offer support to other families and children with the syndrome.\n\nAfter seeing the Ice Bucket Challenge on the news, Aaron asked his mother if he could do something similar.
