You may have also devoured a life-changing slice of the state\u2019s famed blueberry pie \u2014 Maine produces 99% of all U.S. wild blueberries, according to state tourism officials \u2014 or cut fresh tracks with your skis on an uncrowded mountain.\n\nNow, for its next trick, the northernmost state has turned up its charm up to a level 10 as it tries to convert you from doting tourist to permanent resident. Move to Maine, and the state will help you pay down your student loans.\n\nWhile the state of Maine won\u2019t actually cut a check directly to Sallie Mae, the state is offering a tax incentive to offset your student-loan payments. The Educational Opportunity Tax Credit started as a way to retain graduates from Maine\u2019s colleges and universities. Now, it\u2019s expanded to include those who have graduated from colleges and universities anywhere in the U.S. after 2016.\n\nSee: How student-loan debt affects the rest of your life (it\u2019s not pretty)\n\nIn a nutshell, the tax credit allows qualifying residents to subtract their loan payments for the year from their state income taxes. Say you paid $2,000 in student loans and owe the state of Maine $2,200 in taxes. You\u2019re only on the hook for $200 on your state tax return.\n\nStipulations of the program do vary based on your student loans and degree type, and the incentive is most generous for those who have degrees in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering and math.\n\nRead: Here\u2019s exactly where you should retire \u2014 based on what\u2019s important to you\n\nSo why exactly is Maine wooing recent graduates? It turns out Maine is among the states with the oldest populations in the nation, with a median age of 44.6, according to the Census Bureau. As boomers begin retiring, the state recognizes it needs to recruit younger workers to help fill job openings.\n\nMaine\u2019s program could be extra-enticing given that a more widely known national Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program has rejected more than 99% of applicants since it began accepting applications in 2017. Only 96 borrowers out of 28,000 who applied for PSLF had their debt wiped away by the program that promised student-loan forgiveness to those who worked in public-service sectors (such as nurses, police officers and first responders) for 10 years while making loan repayments.\n\nAlso: The true cost of that student loan\n\nState-level student-loan forgiveness programs like Maine\u2019s are smaller in scale than the federal program, of course, but ultimately could be more accessible and effective.\n\nThere are good reasons to consider a move to Maine in addition to student-loan assistance: Maine\u2019s cities regularly appear on Livability\u2019s Top 100 Best Places to Live list, and studies show that Portland, Maine, is not only a top city for affordable health care, but its residents actually live longer than people in other parts of the country. And can we talk about the food scene?\n\nSo, recent graduates, as you mull that move to Maine and the welcome easing of your student-loan burden, consider that the state throws in a mean slice of blueberry pie, too.", "description": "The Pine Tree State offers a tax incentive to offset your student loan payments.", "authors": ["Brittany Anas"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ146_Liv_ma_ZG_20190826130654.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-27"}
