Katie Hill, after news reports that the California Democrat was involved in a three-way relationship with her husband and a female campaign staffer, even as she had an affair with a male staffer in her official congressional office.\n\nHaving a sexual relationship with someone on her staff would violate House rules.\n\nThe committee didn\u2019t release any more details about its probe, other than to say that it has not determined whether a violation has occurred.\n\nAs reported by Red State, a conservative website, Ms. Hill was involved with a 22-year-old campaign staffer and her husband in a \u201cthrouple\u201d relationship.\n\nHer husband was apparently OK with that arrangement, but felt the line was crossed when he learned Ms. Hill, 32, was also having another relationship with her male office employee.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t file for divorce bc she was bi! I just didn\u2019t know she opened our relationship. Lol,\u201d Kenny Heslep, Ms. Hill\u2019s estranged husband, wrote on Facebook.\n\nRed State published text messages it said were from the relationship between Ms. Hill and the 22-year-old campaign staffer.\n\nMs. Hill on Tuesday denied having a relationship with the staffer in her office, calling the allegation \u201cabsolutely false.\u201d She blamed her husband, who she said was \u201cabusive,\u201d for the revelations.\n\n\u201cThis coordinated effort to try to destroy me and people close to me is despicable and will not succeed. I, like many women who have faced attacks like this before, am stronger than those who want me to be afraid,\u201d\n\nThe congresswoman said she had asked the U.S. Capitol Police to investigate the leak of photos, including one published by Red State showing her undressed and brushing another woman\u2019s hair.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
