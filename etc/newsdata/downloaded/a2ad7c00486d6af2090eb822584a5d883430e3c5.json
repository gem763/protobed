This tweet is from 7:54 p.m.\n\nBREAKING - reports of a (US?) helicopter-borne raid on a convoy of Huras al-Din (#AlQaeda in #Syria) leaders traveling near Barisha in #Idlib.\n\n\n\nLocals say as many as 6 choppers involved - gave chase to convoy, 2 landed & assaulted vehicles. Possibly took bodies or evidence away. \u2014 Charles Lister (@Charles_Lister) October 26, 2019\n\nAt about 8:10 p.m. , two hours after arrival, the helicopters departed the compound.\n\nAt about 9:20 p.m. , assuming the same 70-minute flight time, they arrived at the place where the raid had originated. (Trump said the exfiltration used \u201can identical route.\u201d)\n\nAt 9:23 p.m., Trump tweeted.\n\nSomething very big has just happened! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 27, 2019\n\nThat timeline debunks some of the more disparaging assessments of Trump\u2019s activities during the raid. A tweet from the official White House photographer under Obama, Pete Souza, suggested that the photo was taken after the raid had occurred, citing early reports that incorrectly indicated the time of the raid. That tweet prompted additional speculation that the raid occurred while Trump was playing golf, which appears to be incorrect.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat said, there are a number of details presented by Trump which still prompt unanswered questions.\n\nWhere did his claim that Baghdadi was \u201cwhimpering\u201d come from? Among the most evocative assertions made by Trump was his depiction of Baghdadi\u2019s final moments. Trump claimed to have been watching the raid live, as it unfolded, a viewing he said was like \u201cwatching a movie.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe died like a dog, he died like a coward, he was whimpering, screaming and crying,\u201d Trump said at one point. \u201cAnd frankly, I think it\u2019s something that should be brought out so that his followers and all of these young kids that want to leave various countries, including the United States, they should see how he died.\"\n\nAD\n\nOn Monday morning, he reiterated that last point: Perhaps video footage of Baghdadi\u2019s death should be released.\n\nAD\n\nThe rationale here is clear. By depicting Baghdadi as crying and weak, Trump in part hopes to undercut the image his supporters might have of him. (His reference to dogs may have similarly been meant to add insult to injury, though that phrasing is a favorite of Trump\u2019s.)\n\nWhat\u2019s not clear is what Trump actually saw. The New York Times reports that there was probably no audio of the raid, which probably involved footage being taken from aircraft flying overhead.\n\nThat\u2019s reinforced in part by Trump\u2019s description of events in the Situation Room.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe were getting full reports on literally a minute-by-minute basis,\u201d Trump said at one point. \u201c \u2018Sir, we just broke in.\u2019 \u2018Sir, the wall is down.\u2019 \u2018Sir,\u2019 you know, \u2018we\u2019ve captured.\u2019 \u2018Sir, two people are coming out right now. Hands up.\u2019 Fighters.\u201d\n\nThat suggests a need to explain what was being shown.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s possible that soldiers on the ground were equipped with cameras, but no soldiers reportedly followed Baghdadi into the tunnel, just military dogs.\n\nSpeaking to ABC News on Sunday morning, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper was asked about the \u201cwhimpering\u201d claim.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have those details,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president probably had the opportunity to talk to the commanders on the ground.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nEsper is shown sitting to Trump\u2019s immediate left in the photo released by the White House.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t Trump brief Democrats \u2014 even after giving a heads-up to Russia? After Trump announced Baghdadi\u2019s death, he told reporters that he hadn\u2019t briefed congressional Democrats before it began.\n\n\u201cWe were going to notify them last night but we decided not to do that because Washington leaks like I\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing \u2014 there\u2019s no country in the world that leaks like we do. And Washington is a leaking machine. And I told my people we will not notify them until the \u2014 our great people are out. Not just in, but out.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAsked specifically if he had informed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) about the raid, he said he hadn\u2019t.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do that,\u201d Trump said.\u201d I wanted to make sure this was kept secret. I don\u2019t want to have men lost \u2014 and women. I don\u2019t want to have people lost.\"\n\nPelosi replied with a statement shortly afterward.\n\n\u201cThe House must be briefed on this raid, which the Russians but not top congressional leadership were notified of in advance, and on the administration\u2019s overall strategy in the region,\u201d the statement read.\n\nThat part about Russia is accurate. While praising Russia\u2019s assistance with the raid, Trump revealed that the country had been informed it was occurring to clear passage for the U.S. helicopters through Russia-controlled territory. But, he insisted, Russia \u201cdid not know why\u201d U.S. forces sought passage. Just that Russia would \u201cbe very happy\u201d with the outcome.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn other words, Russia knew a raid was happening but not why. Democratic leaders knew neither.\n\nTrump\u2019s assertions about leaks probably played much less of a role in his decision than his frustrations with Pelosi and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who are leading the impeachment inquiry into his interactions with Ukraine.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to exclude the Democrats from preparations raises questions about his obligations under the National Security Act to keep Congress \u201cfully and currently informed\u201d about intelligence activities, including \u201csignificant anticipated intelligence activity.\u201d\n\nWhat role did Syrian Kurds play? The raid, occurring just south of the border between Turkey and Syria, occurred in the context of Trump\u2019s decision earlier this month to allow Turkey to sweep into northeast Syria and displace Syrian Kurds in the area.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDuring his briefing, Trump first offered thanks to Russia (for allowing the helicopters passage), and then thanked Turkey, Syria, Iraq and, as an addendum, the Kurds. Reporters pressed Trump: What help did the Kurds provide?\n\n\u201cThey gave us not a military role at all, but they gave us some information that turned out to be helpful, the Kurds,\u201d he said. He later claimed that, while the United States had worked with the Kurds in fighting the Islamic State, \u201cit was much easier dealing with the Kurds after they went through three days of fighting, because that was a brutal three days.\u201d\n\nThe Times\u2019 Rukmini Callimachi, probably the leading journalist covering the Islamic State, reported after Trump\u2019s remarks that the president\u2019s decision to remove U.S. troops from the Kurd-controlled northeast probably forced the military to act on Baghdadi sooner than anticipated. Reports that Baghdadi planned to move prompted the weekend raid, given concerns about being able to locate him again with fewer resources in the area.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAn official who spoke with the Times was pointed: \u201cThe Syrian and Iraqi Kurds \u2026 provided more intelligence for the raid than any single country.\"\n\nDid Trump say too much? Trump\u2019s depiction of the raid included a number of details that offered an unusual level of specificity. One CNN national security expert described the detail as \u201cirresponsible\u201d and \u201cincrease[s] risks of retaliatory attacks and risks to human sources on the ground.\u201d\n\nAmong those comments was Trump\u2019s explanation of how Baghdadi was located.\n\n\u201cYou can never be 100 percent sure because you\u2019re basing it on technology, more than anything else,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we thought he was there, and then we got a confirmation.\u201d\n\nHe later suggested that the Islamic State had shifted tactics.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not into the use of cellphones anymore,\u201d he said, although he then gave them some unexpected credit: \u201cThey\u2019re very technically brilliant. You know, they use the Internet better than almost anybody in the world, perhaps other than Donald Trump.\u201d", "description": "There are a number of details presented by Trump which prompt unanswered questions.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/5HnCjZXO4N9i86461k6Tq8LXERM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P2H26KHZLUI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
