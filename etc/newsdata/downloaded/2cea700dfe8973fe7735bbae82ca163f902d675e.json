Edenbridge in South East England has hit global headlines for years by burning enormous effigies of controversial public figures \u2014 and this year has selected House of Commons speaker John Bercow.\n\nMr Bercow has marked himself out in the traditionally strictly neutral role of speaker by making himself an activist in the ongoing Brexit debate, a position for which he has been repeatedly criticised. The extent of his interference was such that Tory MPs were moved to break with convention themselves by springing a plot to unseat the speaker, protected by tradition to preserve the neutrality of the post. The plot was eventually headed off by Mr Bercow announcing his retirement.\n\nThe giant wooden effigy shows the controversial speaker in his ceremonial robes \u2014 largely abandoned by the modernising Bercow during his term \u2014 while cradling the severed heads of Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. It was damaged during erection on Wednesday by winds that pulled Mr Bercow\u2019s head off.\n\nThe effigy will be stuffed with fireworks and ignited before a crowd of thousands of spectators on the 2nd, the closest Saturday to November 5th.\n\nIn previous years, Edenbridge has poked fun at other figures including Boris Johnson in his cycling gear in 2018, an almost-naked Harvey Weinstein in 2017, and President Trump holding the severed head of Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nOther British towns mark November 5th in different ways. In Northern Ireland, celebrations are marked a few days later by unusually massive bonfires. In Lewes in Sussex, a series of competing societies vie to outdo each other with the largest burning displays. While in Ottery St Mary in Devon, huge burning barrels are carried through the streets.\n\nSuch is the popularity of such events the organisers and police tend to actively discourage people from attending, as overcrowding and large fires have raised concerns about potential accidents. At Lewes, train services to the town are shut down for the evening to make it more difficult to attend, while in Ottery St Mary large signs reading \u201cyou are here at your own risk\u201d are erected in the town as a warning.\n\nInevitably, the warning signs \u2014 created in the style of ordinary British street signs \u2014 have become part of the lore of the event, with organisers selling keyring and pin-badge replicas of the famous signs to raise money to help cover the high insurance costs to cover the event.", "description": "The preparations for Guy Fawkes Night suffered a setback in Edenbridge after their 36-foot model of John Bercow lost his head in the wind.", "authors": ["Oliver Jj Lane"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1178977660-e1572443060622-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
