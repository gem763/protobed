Mulia Hotel, one of the oldest hotels in the sultanate, became the first hotel in Brunei to install Alipay Payment System in August.\n\nAccording to the hotel, the decision to install Alipay was due to strong demands from their Chinese guests.\n\nIndustry sources indicated that more hotels in the country are expected to join Alipay, primarily due to increasing Chinese tourists.\n\nThe director of operation of Mulia Hotel, Mohd Iswandi who is also the newly-elected president of the Brunei Association of Hotels, told Xinhua that from last year's in-house classification report, Mulia Hotel received around 8,000 guests from China, and this year between January to July, the hotel has already received 14,867 guests from China, a big jump of more than 50 percent.\n\n\"Most tourists, checking in to our hotel from China, will ask for Alipay and that time the hotel staff had no idea what is Alipay. I myself have no idea either,\" Mohd Iswandi explained.\n\n\"So, when we had our meeting with the Brunei Tourism Board, the Minister of Primary Resources and Tourism, Dato Ali asked us to engage with the Alipay team in Brunei. Upon finding out, we engaged with BEEP Digital Solutions, and now we become the first hotel to install the payment system,\" he added.\n\n\"According to the Brunei Tourism Board, there were 60,000 Chinese arrivals to Brunei last year. We only accommodated 8,000 of them. This year may reach 80,000 tourists from China. We already received more than 14,000 from January to July. Thus, the number is increasing,\" Mohd Iswandi said.\n\n\"This month, a direct Beijing-Bandar Seri Begawan flight has been launched. From October to December 2019, there are four weekly flights from Beijing to Bandar Seri Begawan, and starting January 2020, there will be daily flight.\"\n\n\"We are preparing for the influx. In 2018, the Chinese are fast becoming international travelers and they spent hundreds of billions of dollars on holiday travel overseas. Cashless payment is already a culture in China, and Alipay is at the forefront. Thus facilitating our honored guests with their preferred payment system such as Alipay is only logical,\" he further explained.\n\nDenny Muslim, director and chief strategy and product officer at BEEP Digital Solutions said Alipay remains as one of the preferred payment methods for the Chinese outbound tourist with about 99 percent outbound Chinese travelers are Alipay users according to statistics in 2018.\n\nSince launching its mobile payment acceptance solution to market at the end of May, BEEP Digital Solutions has already activated about 50 merchants, mostly in tourists hotspots such as the airport and downtown areas, which are already facing Chinese visitors such as the SBC Duty Free Shop at the airport, Hua Ho Supermarket and Department Store in One City Mall, SKH Supermarket in Annajat Complex and Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf in One City Mall.\n\n\"In Brunei, there is a need to further facilitate local spending by the Chinese with Chinese tourists already topping the tourist arrivals into Brunei. Beyond being just a payment facilitator, Alipay is ideally positioned as a marketing platform, being able to reach out and engage its users through digital channels more effectively driving more traffic to the merchants' storefront and allowing them to realize better revenue opportunities,\" Denny said.\n\n\"With Mulia Hotel now on board as Chinese-tourists-friendly hotel having its commercial establishments being able to accept Alipay Mobile Payments, it is hoped that other hotels in the country would also follow suit to serve their Chinese customers better. With an increasing base of merchants already taking up the payment solution, BEEP Digital Solutions is also working with local stakeholders such as Brunei Tourism Board and the Brunei Association of Hotels to further capitalize on the China opportunity.\"\n\nXinhua", "description": "BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN - Since its launch in Brunei at the end of May this year, the number of businesses accepting Alipay payment from Chinese visitors is on the rise.", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
