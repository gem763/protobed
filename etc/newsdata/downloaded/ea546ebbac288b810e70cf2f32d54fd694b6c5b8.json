Two of them were to fulfil a promise to take the Scottish Rugby Union squad to Japan for the Rugby World Cup: a single Edinburgh-Heathrow and Heathrow-Tokyo flight. In addition, a Sydney-Singapore-Heathrow service operated.\n\nThe pilots had planned to strike again on Friday 27 September. But nine days beforehand, Balpa called off the strike to allow for \u201ca period of reflection\u201d.\n\nHow did British Airways respond?\n\nSlowly. Over two hours after the union\u2019s announcement, BA placed on its website the brief message: \u201cThe pilots\u2019 union, Balpa, has called off its strike on 27 September. We are now considering the implications for our schedule and we will give updates in due course.\u201d\n\nIt has not yet said if some or all of the cancelled flights will be reinstated.\n\nBut some BA flights will be taking off?\n\nYes, unlike in the previous strike, British Airways was evidently confident that it could operate a skeleton service on some key European services.\n\nThe Independent has found that tickets are available on two services to Milan Malpensa, Rome Fiumicino and Stockholm Arlanda, and one each to Barcelona, Frankfurt, Geneva, Munich, Paris Charles de Gaulle and Zurich.\n\nThese represent a fraction of the normal operation \u2013 on most of these routes there are normally six, seven or eight flights a day.\n\nThe Independent has checked dozens of other routes and has found no services planned on domestic or long-haul routes, and none at all from Gatwick.\n\nOn the flights that are running, what are the fares like?\n\nExtremely high. The Heathrow-Paris hop, which cover barely 200 miles and can involve as little as half-an-hour in the air, is selling for \u00a3359 in economy, while the 575-mile journey from Heathrow to Munich is priced at \u00a3582.\n\nIs it likely that other flights will be reinstated?\n\nThe Independent has repeatedly asked British Airways, but without success. The problem is that the airline redrew its pilot, cabin crew and aircraft rosters to accommodate the strike on 27 September. Unpicking the process is an extremely complex procedure.\n\nFurthermore, almost all 100,000 or so passengers booked on that date (and affected services on adjacent days) have accepted alternative flights or refunds. Therefore even if the flights are reinstated they would be relatively empty \u2013 at considerable cost to the airline and the environment.\n\nI was booked to fly and my flight was cancelled. I accepted an alternative which is not as good. Will I be able to switch back if my flight is reinstated?\n\nProbably, though at present it is academic since no extra flights have been scheduled.\n\nI cancelled for a full refund and rebooked on a different airline. Can I get my money back on that new flight and go back to my BA one?\n\nNo. Your contract with British Airways ended when you accepted a refund.\n\nI moved my dates and rebooked a hotel. I would like to move them back. Will BA pay for the accommodation costs?\n\nIt appears to have no legal obligation but is likely to consider issues like this on a case-by-case basis.\n\nCould there be bargains around?\n\nIf the airline reinstates a significant proportion of its services, there may be. It is likely to focus on high-revenue routes with a late-booking profile, such as Heathrow-New York, rather than leisure links normally booked months ahead, including Florida and Caribbean services from Gatwick.\n\nMight the pilots strike again?\n\nPossibly, if British Airways does not agree to reopen negotiations.
