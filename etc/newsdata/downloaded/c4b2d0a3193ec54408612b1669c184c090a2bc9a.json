They often would travel together with McCarrick on fundraising trips to churches and the homes of donors nationwide, where the abuse allegedly would occur. The accuser and his family met McCarrick at a church function when the man was a young child.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs adults, some would speak about their alleged abuse to one another in the barest of terms.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until late last year, however, after allegations involving two other boys became public, that the man said he and other accusers contacted officials. The Washington Post does not identify victims of sexual assault or abuse without their permission.\n\nThe man said he and other victims since last year have cooperated with church and civil investigators as well as Vatican officials. After that, he said, he wanted to move on. He was driven, however, to speak out following a recent interview McCarrick gave to Slate in which the onetime fundraising and diplomatic church star denied wrongdoing.\n\nAD\n\nIn a September article, McCarrick said he is \u201cnot as bad as they paint me. I do not believe that I did the things that they accused me of.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe reporter told him that \u201cit sounded like he thought it was possible \u2014 that saying he didn\u2019t \u2018believe\u2019 he had done those things, or that he doesn\u2019t remember them, makes it sound as if he\u2019s leaving it an open question. No, he said.\u201d\n\nMcCarrick, 89, is unlikely to face criminal prosecution for his alleged abuse and harassment of the youth and seminarian cases first reported in the summer of 2018. Those allegations relate to crimes that would be beyond the statutes of limitation in the United States, where they are said to have occurred.\n\nAD\n\nMcCarrick\u2019s attorney, Barry Coburn, declined to comment on the new accusations.\n\nThe victim said the group of accusers of which he is part have communicated with civil officials, including the New York County district attorney. A spokeswoman there declined to comment on the status of any ongoing inquiries. The archdiocese of Newark and the diocese of Metuchen, N.J., also declined to comment on investigations of McCarrick, which they characterized as continuing.\n\nAD\n\nThe man said McCarrick\u2019s interview with Slate spurred him to write an essay. \u201cHe attempted to discredit the victims of his sexual abuse while creating further division and confusion within our church,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nThe essay described how the childhood acquaintances steeled themselves after decades to report the alleged abuse to church and civil officials. Some call themselves \u201cthe Nathans,\u201d the man said, citing a prophet who in the Bible called out David for adultery and abusing power.\n\n(Pope Francis in a sermon last Christmas called for \u201cnew Nathans to help so many Davids rouse themselves from a hypocritical and perverse life \u2026 victims, carefully selected by their predators, often prefer silence and live in fear of shame and the terror of rejection.\u201d)\n\nThe essay details \u201cfundraising-related overnight trips between the years 1970 and 1990 that, as fate would have it, all resulted in McCarrick sharing a bed with a young Catholic boy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe man said he was speaking out about the extent of McCarrick\u2019s alleged abuse in hopes that it will focus Catholic attention on the former D.C. and New Jersey archbishop rather than raging divisions in the faith.\n\n\u201cFor me, this is not an attack on our Church. This is not about Conservative vs Liberal. This is not about Straight vs Gay. This is not about Benedict vs. Francis. In my view, those arguments are a distraction. For me, this is about our humanity. This is about the criminal, sexual abuse of minors,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe victim declined to give details about McCarrick\u2019s system with the network of boys but said the ex-cardinal was able to get away with it because of his natural gifts: \u201cHe was charming. He was self-effacing. He was completely disarming. And he ran that game on everyone. He ran it on his colleagues, donors and on young boys. Everyone around this guy is just a different shade of victim.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMcCarrick was laicized \u2014 or reverted to the status of a layperson \u2014 in February, the most significant abuse-related punishment given to a Catholic cardinal in modern history. The Vatican was unspecific about the number of victims, saying in a short statement that a church process found him guilty of two charges \u2014 soliciting sex during confession and committing \u201csins\u201d with minors and adults with the aggravating factor the abuse of power.\u201d\n\nBy then, several current and former seminarians had come forward to allege that McCarrick had sexually harassed them. Two sexual abuse allegations against McCarrick were also known \u2014 that of an unnamed former altar boy whose complaint in 2018 of abuse a decade earlier led to McCarrick\u2019s initial suspension and that of James Grein, a Virginia man whose family was close to the former cardinal and who said he was abused for many years, starting at age 11.\n\nThe New Yorker in April quoted an official with a New York archdiocesan church restitution program as saying they had received seven complaints against McCarrick.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSince McCarrick was defrocked, the Vatican has not commented on its broader investigation of his career, in particular how he moved to the very top of the Catholic Church despite rumors and complaints of misconduct. Pope Francis on Oct. 6, 2018, pledged a \u201cthorough\u201d study of Vatican archives related to McCarrick and said the church would \u201cmake known the conclusions.\u201d This month a Vatican spokesman declined to comment on the inquiry, saying only that \u201cthe work is in progress.\u201d\n\nThe accuser who spoke to The Post is one of five men represented by the same attorney, Kevin Mulhearn. He said he was aware of at least seven other accusers. Camille Biros, a member of the independent reconciliation and compensation board set up by the New York archdiocese, said she was aware of at least seven boys. The source with direct knowledge of all the claims U.S. church officials sent to the Vatican says the number of boys is at least 10. That person spoke on the condition of anonymity because canon law forbids unauthorized people to speak about internal cases or even to acknowledge that the cases exist.\n\nThe Catholic Church is among secular and religious institutions nationwide reckoning in a new way with old allegations of sexual abuse. More than a dozen states \u2014 including New York and New Jersey, where McCarrick began his career \u2014 significantly extended statutes of limitation for filing lawsuits over abuse. More than a dozen attorneys general are investigating the church\u2019s handling of the cases.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDioceses in multiple states, including New York, have begun a streamlined process \u2014 an independent, out-of-court program to hear and process claims of abuse, and to pay compensation.\n\nThe McCarrick case remains open. The person close to the U.S. church\u2019s investigation said a complaint of youth abuse against McCarrick also was reported to police in Ireland. The man who spoke to The Post wrote in his essay of \u201cmany\u201d boys on trips alone with McCarrick, and said \u201cthe Nathans\u201d had testified about \u201chundreds of Church-related or fundraising-related overnight trips.\u201d\n\nChico Harlan in Rome contributed to this report.", "description": "An alleged victim says many of the youths knew one another.", "authors": ["Michelle Boorstein", "Religion Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/5JSAM1tZmaYYmul8Rs0MwX3cyRw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DWLASHWRPAI6RA6WFEP45LJKWE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
