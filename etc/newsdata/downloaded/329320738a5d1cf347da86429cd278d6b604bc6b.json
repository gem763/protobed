The SDF still has people there,' Jeffrey said.\n\n'We are monitoring that as best we can. We still have people in Syria working with the SDF and one of those priorities is these prisons,' he said.\n\nThe SDF were Washington's main allies in the push to defeat ISIS earlier this year when the terror group's so-called 'caliphate' crumbled to nothing.\n\nThe al-Hol camp (pictured earlier this year) houses tens of thousands of displaced people including relatives of ISIS fighters and security fears have been on the rise\n\nA map showing the area that will be patrolled by Russian and Turkish forces under the agreement struck between Putin and Erdogan yesterday\n\nTrump has since been accused of 'betraying' the Kurds by pulling out U.S. troops and clearing the way for a Turkish invasion.\n\nISIS has continued to claim deadly attacks in Kurdish-held areas since losing its last scrap of territory in March.\n\nJeffrey also told Congress that he was 'cynical' about the Turkey-Russia agreement which will see the two countries jointly patrol the border zone.\n\nYesterday he said that the U.S. was counting on both Turkey and the Kurdish fighters to contain ISIS in Syria.\n\n'Both Turkey and the SDF have fought against ISIS,' he told a U.S. Senate panel yesterday.\n\n'If they are not forced to face off against each other, we can rely on both of them against ISIS,' he said.\n\n'We've done a pretty good job of bringing this attack to a halt. Turkey has not really gained all that much from this.'\n\nHe estimated that the number of Kurdish victims of Turkey's advance was 'in the low hundreds.'\n\nToday Russian troops crossed the Euphrates River in Syria and will start patrolling the area alongside Syrian forces, under the deal struck in Sochi yesterday.\n\nProvocation: The Turkish flag (right) and the emblem of anti-Assad rebels in Syria (left) are unfurled on the roof of a former Kurdish headquarters in the town of Ras al-Ain today\n\nA US military vehicle flying the Kurdish flag can be seen arriving in Iraqi Kurdistan after its withdrawal from northern Syria\n\nRussian patrols have already begun near the city of Manbij, where U.S. troops were manning a base until two weeks ago.\n\nFrom today, Russian military police and Syrian border guards will 'facilitate the removal' of Kurdish fighters and their weapons from within 18 miles of the border.\n\nThis withdrawal must be finalised within 150 hours, according to a text of the agreement released after the talks.\n\nThe Russians entered the city of Kobani in a particularly symbolic blow to the Kurds, who fought ISIS for control of it in 2014-15.\n\nTrump declared today that captured ISIS prisoners had been 'secured' as he hailed the deal and said the Kurds were 'safe and have worked very nicely with us'.\n\nOnce the Kurdish fighters have withdrawn, Russian and Turkish forces will then begin joint patrols along the Turkish-controlled zone.\n\nThe two countries are also said to be in talks about extra deliveries of Russian-made S-400 missile defence systems to Ankara.\n\nIn the Kurdish-controlled city of Qamishli - excluded from the Sochi agreement - hundreds demonstrated against the deal on Wednesday, saying it amounted to ethnic cleansing and genocide.\n\nIn the early hours of Wednesday, Turkey said it had been informed by the U.S. that their withdrawal from the border areas had been 'completed'.\n\n'At this stage, there is no further need to carry out a new operation,' the defence ministry said in a statement.\n\nHowever, Erdogan vowed that Turkey would take 'the necessary steps' if Russian and American promises to push Kurdish fighters away were not kept.", "description": "James Jeffrey, Washington's special envoy for Syria, said the number is 'now over 100' and said: 'We do not know where they are'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/16/20089182-0-image-a-5_1571843854682.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
