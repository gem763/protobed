But armed violence has persisted, particularly in North Kivu province, south of Ituri, which is also the epicenter of a 10-month Ebola outbreak.", "description": "At least 28 people have been killed in a northeastern province of Democratic Republic of Congo in the past two days, the UN stabilizing mission in the country (MONUSCO) said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
