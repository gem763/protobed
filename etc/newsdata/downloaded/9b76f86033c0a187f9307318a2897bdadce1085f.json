There needs to be some adjustment to the name, image and likeness approach to make sure we don\u2019t create those problems.\"\n\nRomney is working across the aisle with Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) on the matter. He said adjustments must be in place so there is some level of parity among all athletes.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think you can have an athlete at a school making a million dollars at that school and lording it over everyone else on the team and at the campus,\" he said. \"That\u2019s what they\u2019re going to get when they go pro. When they\u2019re at school, they\u2019re still a student-athlete and there has to be some limit to how much money is coming to an individual and there has to be a way to get compensation to other members of the team. I mean, that left tackle also needs to have some capacity to have some funds to make ends meet and to help their family, particularly when they come from such an impoverished background as so many do.\"\n\nAs for whether he supported having legislation that would taxing scholarships given to athletes who choose to \u201ccash in\u201d \u2014 an idea proposed on Twitter by Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) \u2014 Romney said it's too early in the process to go there.\n\n\"I think the idea is, if there are some people that are going to be millionaires and multi-millionaires in college, then you do talk about, \u2018Wait a second, what\u2019s the tax implication of that?\u2019\" Romney said. \"But I\u2019m not looking for something of that nature. I think if we go in that direction it would be pretty harming to the nature of collegiate sport.\"", "description": "Mitt Romney said \"we can't have ... athletes on campus driving around in a Ferrari\" when discussing the NCAA's name, image and likeness debate.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/30/USAT/2718b9bc-72e6-4c96-8760-8e853ad78dd0-Mittens.JPG?crop=2251,1266,x1,y40&width=1717&height=1266&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
