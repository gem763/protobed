At their 1960s peak, with Detroit-based Motown records, the Supremes rivalled the Beatles. Wilson\u2019s 1986 autobiography, Dreamgirl: My Life as a Supreme, was a bestseller. She had three children (one of whom, Rafael, 16, died when the Jeep Cherokee his mother was driving overturned on a highway in 1994). Meeting to discuss her new book Supreme Glamour, a sartorial history of the Supremes, Wilson is friendly, warm and delighted to be back in Britain, where she first toured in the 1960s, later living here for a while: \u201cI fell in love with it here \u2013 I thought I was going to marry an Englishman!\u201d Featuring creations from designers from Michael Travis to\n\nYou call the Supremes \u201cthe original pop fashionistas\u201d.\n\nWe were! You can look at Beyonc\u00e9, and I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t she who copied us, but her mother would have grown up with the Supremes. We loved to dress up. Other girls, like the Shirelles, wore gowns, but our clothes were like couture.\n\nThe Supremes\u2019 style was also a political statement \u2013 about black affluence and sophistication, all the huge social and cultural changes of the period.\n\nYes, my brother would say: \u201cMary, why don\u2019t y\u2019all wear some afros?\u201d I\u2019m like, no, we\u2019re making a statement in our own way. That was the time of \u201cblack is beautiful\u201d and \u201cblack pride\u201d, which was cool. We did it later.\n\nPrincess Margaret asked me: 'Is that a wig you\u2019re wearing?' And it was loud!\n\nYou were just teenagers when you joined Motown...\n\nIt really was like walking into a Disneyland. All these creative people. People say: \u201cMotown, it was this big building\u201d, but I always say no, Motown was always a collaboration between the people, with Berry (Gordy) at the head of course.\n\nYou\u2019ve had disputes with Motown over the years, but you\u2019re like a family?\n\nYes, a family. I think we all think of ourselves as distant cousins. There are some things, but there\u2019s no hate \u2013 I still would want to be at Motown. And you know, there\u2019s always going to be something \u2013 even if you\u2019re married to the man you love, maybe he leaves up the toilet seat?\n\nFor a time, the Supremes outsold the Beatles. Didn\u2019t they meet you and call you \u201csquare\u201d?\n\nWe were \u2013 there were rock\u2019n\u2019roll girls and we were good girls! I don\u2019t think there was rivalry between us and the Beatles. Paul [McCartney] called me when Diane [Diana Ross] left, saying: \u201cWhy did she leave \u2013 what\u2019s going on?\u201d Entertainers are really quite friendly with each other. Unless some person irks you and you think, \u201cThat person irks me!\u201d\n\nWasn\u2019t Princess Margaret rather rude to you at a Royal Variety Performance?\n\nYes. She said: \u201cIs that a wig you\u2019re wearing?\u201d And it was loud! I thought [with] royalty, you\u2019d meet them and it would be: \u201cIt\u2019s lovely to meet you\u201d, but it was: \u201cOh, is that a wig you\u2019re wearing?\u201d Whoa! She sounded like one of my neighbours in the projects.\n\nYou write about the Supremes touring the deep south, dealing with segregated hotels and bathrooms.\n\nThere were signs that said \u201cNo coloured\u201d. If you drank out of a water fountain that said it was for white people, they could hang you. People can\u2019t even imagine what most black people endured.\n\nNow there are movements such as Black Lives Matter...\n\nPeople are still fighting for their right to be a human being. When Obama won, it was amazing. Most of our parents had died. Had they still been alive, they would not have believed that could happen. Someone asked me: How do you feel?\u201d I said: \u201cI can see my mom, my aunt, my uncles, all saying, \u2018Hallelujah! Hallelujah!\u2019\u201d\n\nHave you felt a change of atmosphere with Trump?\n\nAre you kidding? Of course! I don\u2019t mind the Republican beliefs, it\u2019s not about that. But his thinking is all wrong. Not to get too much into politics, but it should be about what the people want, about helping the people, not about personal opinions.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Supremes recording in London, 1965, left to right: Diana Ross, Mary Wilson, Florence Ballard. Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty\n\nThere\u2019ve been rifts with Diana Ross. Are you back on friendly terms \u2013 you call her \u201cDiane\u201d in the book?\n\nShe grew up as Diane, and Florence grew up as Flo. We\u2019re friends but we don\u2019t call each other constantly. We\u2019ve grown apart, but it\u2019s not because we don\u2019t like each other. My love for Flo and Diane is pretty much almost the same as for my sisters \u2013 we had so much together, we grew up together.\n\nIt comes across strongly in the book that you\u2019re still grieving for Florence. (After leaving the Supremes, Ballard, who\u2019d been sexually assaulted as a child, struggled with depression and alcoholism and died of a heart attack, aged 32.)\n\nOh God yeah \u2013 because she got the short end of life. She didn\u2019t have a chance. Can you imagine if somebody raped you at the age of 14? You\u2019d be angry, you\u2019d be hurt, you\u2019d be\u2026 broken. Back then, your parents protected you by not telling anyone, but that was not protecting. What hurts me is that some people say: \u201cOne of the Supremes was an alcoholic.\u201d Flo drank to cover the pain. She only become an alcoholic because of that.\n\nYou still feel protective?\n\nI feel the same way about Diane. I can tell you things about Diane I wish she wasn\u2019t. I can tell you things about me, I wish I wasn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all bad. I was very lucky all my life until I lost Flo. And then my son [Rafael]. I think you\u2019re lucky if you don\u2019t get that kind of loss in your life. You can lose a job, you can lose a love, but the loss of a child, and the loss of a dear friend, can be very detrimental. It helped me grow up and I don\u2019t mean in a good way. It made me see that life can be very cruel to someone you love.\n\nThe Supremes achieved incredible fame. You must be recognised everywhere you go.\n\nI tell my daughter: \u201cI\u2019m very normal\u201d and she says \u201cMom: you\u2019re not normal\u201d. I\u2019ve gone incognito, to the grocery store, no make-up on, and been recognised. I\u2019m like: \u201cHow can you tell?\u201d And they\u2019re like: \u201cOh girl, we can tell\u201d. I told one: \u201cI wish I was Mary Wilson \u2013 I wish I had her money!\u201d\n\nYou talk in the book about the importance of daring to dream.\n\nWe, the Supremes, can\u2019t take all the credit. The writers and producers at Motown gave us the music and sound that people loved. And then there was the glamour. My whole life is like a dream. I tell you \u2013 if I were not a Supreme, I would want to be a Supreme. I\u2019m living the dream.\n\nSupreme Glamour by Mary Wilson, with Mark Bego, is published by Thames & Hudson (\u00a329.95); Hitsville: The Making of Motown is in cinemas on 30 September.
