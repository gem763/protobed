Because when you give a green light to an authoritarian, terrible things can happen\u2014and terrible things very much did.\u201d\n\nSNL: Darrell Hammond\u2019s Bill Clinton and Alec Baldwin\u2019s Trump Bond Over Impeachment\n\nStephen Colbert Condemns Trump for Doing Putin\u2019s Bidding in Syria\n\nOliver then aired a video of a Turkish militia cheerily executing a Kurd by roadside in Syria. \u201cThat is horrifying, a potential war crime, and completely, completely avoidable. Yet astonishingly, even in the face of scenes like that\u2014and over a hundred civilian deaths\u2014Trump has tried to spin the carnage as evidence of his tactical genius,\u201d Oliver explained.\n\nHe threw to a video of Trump at a rally proclaiming, \u201cSometimes you have to let them fight. It\u2019s like two kids in a lot: you got to let them fight, and then you pull them apart.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about?! You weird monster!\u201d exclaimed Oliver.\n\n\u201cI know that it is so easy to criticize anyone\u2019s policy in this region. It is very complicated; any move is going to have ripple effects, intended or otherwise. Syria was one of the biggest problem spots in Obama\u2019s foreign policy,\u201d the comedian continued. \u201cBut it\u2019s genuinely hard to get it this wrong. We took a fundamentally stable situation, betrayed a strategically-vital ally, and immensely damaged our reputation.\u201d\n\nThe HBO host aired a clip of Kurdish civilians throwing potatoes and cursing at a U.S. military convoy leaving Syria.\n\n\u201cLook, the more you look at all of this, the more worrying it gets\u2014because this was an unforced error. Trump chose to do something this sudden, this impetuous, and this damaging, and he\u2019s just not going to change,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cSo imagine what he might do in a crisis not of his own making? That is one of the many terrifying things of the prospect of a second term, or indeed, the remaining year of this first one, because there is nothing more dangerous than someone with a massive amount of power, a dictator fetish, and an inability to think in anything other than transactional terms.\u201d\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
