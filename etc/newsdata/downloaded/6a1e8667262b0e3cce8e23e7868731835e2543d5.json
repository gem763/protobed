Despite having all three timeouts, Kitchens had Baker Mayfield throw four times, and his last one was intercepted in the end zone.\n\nBut despite concerns he might have too much on his plate, Kitchens isn\u2019t handing off play-calling duties to coordinator Todd Monken or anyone.\n\n\u201cNot gonna happen,\u201d Kitchens said firmly Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s me. It\u2019s my fault. Todd does a great job during the course of the week of making sure we stay on task, we stay organized. But when things mess up, it\u2019s going to be me.\u201d\n\nWhile noble, Kitchens\u2019 choice to point the finger at himself and be accountable doesn\u2019t minimize that the Browns (1-2) are not playing up to their own expectations - especially on offense. They and are suffering through early growing pains far more severe than many imagined.\n\nKitchens won\u2019t make excuses, though it would be easy to point out that Cleveland was missing seven starters, including its entire secondary, and still took one of the NFL\u2019s best teams to the wire.\n\nThe Browns are incomplete, a work in progress after three games.\n\n\u201cWe will be fine,\u201d Kitchens said. \u201cNobody is panicking. We are not panicking, but we also understand the shortcomings we have had. I understand the shortcomings that I have had. I am going to get it better. Our team is going to get better.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ve made strides since a Week 1 debacle, playing with more composure, cutting down penalties.\n\nBut the Browns haven\u2019t found cohesion on either side of the ball, and there\u2019s a growing concern outside the team that Kitchens might be overmatched. This is his first experience as a head coach at any level, and while Kitchens learns on the fly, the Browns may take some lumps.\n\nKitchens doesn\u2019t mind the criticism. In fact, he seems to enjoy the challenge of proving people wrong. This is nothing new to him, and Kitchens isn\u2019t worried he won\u2019t succeed.\n\n\u201cOur team understands this: that some of these situations are new for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI also understand that I will get better from it and I understand our team will get better from them. \u2026 We are building this thing. We wanted to play better this week than we did last week, and we did that. We want to play better next week than we did this week, and we will do that. This is a continual climb.\u201d\n\nAnd right now, a slow one.\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nDespite being down five starters, Cleveland\u2019s defense did a good job pressuring Rams quarterback Jared Goff, who was stripped by Myles Garrett and threw two interceptions. Garrett behaved and was penalty free after committing five in the first two games.\n\nRunning back Nick Chubb had another solid game - 96 yards on 23 carries - but didn\u2019t touch the ball with the game hanging in the balance, a decision Kitchens regrets.\n\n\u201cI do wish I would have given the ball to Nick one time,\u201d he said.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nThe Browns are averaging 16.3 points, nowhere near their potential with an offense featuring Mayfield, Chubb and star receivers Odell Beckham Jr. and Jarvis Landry.\n\nKitchens has been far more conservative than last season, when the Browns were unpredictably exciting. It might be time for him to turn things loose.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nChubb has become one of the league\u2019s most consistent backs, and Kitchens may soon start riding him more while the passing attack evolves.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nMayfield looks uneasy in the pocket, and has been prone to the quick scramble - almost always to the right side. He missed an open Landry slanting at the goal line on the final drive, and hasn\u2019t been as accurate (56.9 percent) as last season (63.8).\n\nINJURED\n\nThe Browns experienced a freakish frenzy of three hamstring injuries in a 10-minute span of practice Friday, with starting cornerbacks Denzel Ward and rookie Greedy Williams both going down and missing Sunday\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cIt was crazy,\u201d said Ward, who had hoped to play all 16 games after missing three last season with two concussions.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n16 - Mayfield has thrown a TD pass in each of his first 16 career starts, a streak second only to Hall of Famer Kurt Warner\u2019s 24.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThere are no breaks in the upcoming schedule as the Browns play road games at Baltimore (2-1) and San Francisco (3-0) before hosting Seattle (2-1).\n\nKitchens insists he\u2019s not feeling any internal pressure, but it will increase significantly without a couple wins.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Freddie Kitchens' face was flushed with frustration, his cheeks glowing as bright as his orange hoodie.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tom Withers"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/rams_browns_football_74465_c0-933-2034-2118_s1770x1032.jpg?b58348f2e69a8bf159a05db245988ca9593d3633", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
