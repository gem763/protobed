(AP) - Brian Kelly decided to be proactive before No. 7 Notre Dame gets more than a wakeup call.\n\nAfter viewing film of his team\u2019s lackluster 35-17 victory at Louisville and with 12 days to prepare for Saturday\u2019s home opener against New Mexico, the Fighting Irish coach decided he wasn\u2019t going to make things easy for his players with such an early bye week. The Irish got physical last Friday and Saturday.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a week off, you look at yourself and what you need to do to continue to build,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cIt was about living up to a standard. We tackled. We scrimmaged. It was a physically demanding and mentally demanding week for our team.\u201d\n\nThe Irish, who trailed 14-7 after Louisville\u2019s first two possessions, scored 21 unanswered points to take command of the game and finished with a 423-383 advantage in total yards despite being outrushed 249-230. Senior quarterback Ian Book passed for 193 yards, rushed for 81 more and accounted for two touchdowns, but he also was sacked three times and fumbled twice, losing one. Notre Dame converted only five of its 12 on third-down conversions against a team that had one of the worst defenses in the country a year ago.\n\nThere was plenty to clean up before welcoming the Lobos, who opened with a 39-31 victory against FCS power Sam Houston State.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to be more calm, cool and collected,\u201d senior wide receiver Chase Claypool said.\n\nNO DAVIE\n\nThe first meeting between the two schools will not include a homecoming for New Mexico coach Bob Davie, who was fired by Notre Dame in 2001.\n\nThe 64-year-old Davie collapsed in the locker room following New Mexico\u2019s victory over Sam Houston State from a \u201csevere medical incident\u201d and will remain in Albuquerque as offensive line coach Saga Tuitele handles Davie\u2019s duties on the sideline Saturday.\n\n\u201cThis game, quite honestly, was never about me coming back to Notre Dame,\u201d Davie said this week. \u201cThe key for us is to improve.\u201d\n\nThe Lobos are approaching it as a fun business trip.\n\n\u201cWe will do enough on Friday when we get there to get all the awe out of our players, out of their heads and out of their minds,\u201d Tuitele said. \u201cThen it\u2019s back to football. It\u2019s about winning your one-on-one matchups and executing your game plan.\u201d\n\nNew Mexico will receive $1.1 million from Notre Dame for the visit.\n\nBALL CONTROL\n\nBook may have fumbled twice and lost one against Louisville, but the Irish running back corps has good hands. Notre Dame\u2019s running backs have gone 571 carries since their last fumble, the longest active streak among FBS teams.\n\nMAKING THEIR POINTS QUICKLY\n\nNew Mexico, which got 107 yards on 16 carries from senior running back Ahmari Davis, had four lightning-fast touchdown drives against Sam Houston State. They took 1:57, 0:59, 0:41 and 0:23.\n\nINJURY UPDATES\n\nNotre Dame running back Jafar Armstrong is out for several weeks after surgery on an abdominal muscle. Tony Jones Jr. (110 yards, TD vs. Louisville), Jahmir Smith (2 TDs), Kyren Williams, C\u2019Bo Flemister and Avery Davis could all see time. Smith has been limited by a sprained toe. Tight end Cole Kmet could also play after recovering from a broken right collarbone\n\nNew Mexico lost starting QB Brandt Hughes with a shoulder injury in the first half of its opener. Senior Sheriron Jones, who replaced Hughes and threw for 122 yards and ran for two scores, battled sophomore Tekava Tuioti and freshman Trae Hall during practice this week.\n\nThe Lobos won\u2019t have senior nose tackle Aaron Blackwell, who was lost for the season with an ACL injury.\n\n\u201cAaron is a big loss for us, being the captain and emotional leader for us,\u201d Tuitele said. \u201cBut we\u2019re deep at the d-line right now - we can move some guys in and out of different spots.\u201d\n\nHE SAID IT\n\n\u201cThey balled out.\u201d - Notre Dame running back Tony Jones Jr. on the Irish offensive line after he piled up nearly half the team\u2019s 230 rushing yards against Louisville.\n\n___\n\nAP freelancer writer Glen Rosales contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Brian Kelly decided to be proactive before No. 7 Notre Dame gets more than a wakeup call.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Fineran"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/notre_dame_louisville_football_33661_c0-175-4184-2614_s1770x1032.jpg?b68ef6d9713bbd3f22c4595c4c2cf5201d9c119a", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
