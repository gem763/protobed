It also comes at a fraught time in Francis\u2019 six-year papacy, with conservative opposition to his ecological agenda on the rise.\n\nFrancis\u2019 traditionalist critics, including a handful of cardinals, have called the proposals in the synod working document \u201cheretical\u201d and an invitation to a \u201cpagan\u201d religion that idolizes nature rather than God.\n\nTo that criticism, Hummes denounced Catholic \u201ctraditionalism\u201d that is stuck in the past versus the church\u2019s true tradition, which always looks forward.\n\n\u201cThe church cannot remain inactive within her own closed circle, focused on herself, surrounded by protective walls and even less can she look nostalgically to the past,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Church needs to throw open her doors, knock down the walls surrounding her and build bridges.\u201d\n\nIn keeping with the meeting\u2019s environmental message, the synod organizers themselves are taking measures to reduce their own carbon footprint.\n\nOrganizer Cardinal Lorenzo Baldisseri told the bishops there would be no plastic cups or utensils at the meeting, that synod swag such as bags and pens were biodegradable, and that the emissions spent to get more than 200 bishops and indigenous from South America to Rome \u2014 estimated at 572,809 kilograms of carbon dioxide \u2014 would be offset with the purchase of 50 hectares of new growth forest in the Amazon.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Pope Francis urged South American bishops on Monday to speak \"courageously\" at a high-profile meeting on the Amazon, where the shortage of priests is so acute that the Vatican is considering ordaining married men and giving women official church ministries.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Nicole Winfield"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/07/aptopix_vatican_amazon_39008_c0-218-5216-3259_s1770x1032.jpg?45207fb801438e055fec4db81ce1f7233cbcec88", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
