If it is time for the sake of time? It has taken one year, even three years, and we don't really get it,\" she said.\n\nUK Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay, left, shakes hands with European Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier before their meeting at the European Commission headquarters in Brussels, Friday, Oct. 11, 2019.
