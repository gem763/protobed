REUTERS/Akhtar Soomro\n\nThe 5.8 magnitude earthquake levelled houses, shops and other buildings, and injured around 500 people on Tuesday near Mirpur, in Pakistan\u2019s portion of the disputed Kashmir territory.\n\nMost of the deaths and injuries were caused by old village houses collapsing, said Sardar Gulfaraz Khan, the deputy inspector general of police for Mirpur district.\n\nAmong them was the son of Mohamad Zaman, who hurried home from his job as a rickshaw driver after the earthquake struck to hear that 12-year-old Afzal had been hit by a falling wall, suffering a head injury.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of old homes so apparently the damage is done due to those,\u201d Zaman told Reuters at a hospital in Mirpur, where his son was being treated.\n\nThe few new homes in the district, built with stronger structures, all survived, he said.\n\nA 2005 earthquake that devastated much of Kashmir and killed more than 80,000 people prompted an update to Pakistan\u2019s building code to make rebuilt houses safer.\n\nBut 14 years on, some say complacency has set in, in a country crossed by geological fault lines.\n\n\u201cDisasters happen and the people have to just look after themselves because the institutions are not strong enough,\u201d said architect Arif Hasan, referring to local authorities who enforce standards. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the teeth or the finances to do it.\u201d\n\nRapid urbanization in Pakistan has meant housing has been quickly built to keep up with demand, said Michael Kugelman, senior associate for South Asia at the Wilson Center think-tank.\n\n\u201cIt all becomes quite unregulated, inefficient, and ultimately dangerous,\u201d he said.\n\nChaudhry Tariq Farooq, Pakistani Kashmir\u2019s minister for physical planning and housing, said there have indeed been lapses in enforcement of building codes.\n\n\u201cSince our territory sits on fault lines that become active every now and then, we will have to, and we will, take harsh measures for implementation of building codes in letter and in spirit,\u201d he said.\n\nHomes built with bricks or concrete blocks are particularly vulnerable, because each building unit shifts independently in an earthquake, said retired architecture professor Yasmin Cheema.\n\nEven among new houses, a dangerous construction model of unreinforced masonry with no involvement from a structural engineer is widespread in Pakistan\u2019s towns and cities, according to Muhammad Masood Rafi, the head of NED University\u2019s earthquake engineering department. He is organising a team of engineering students and experts to travel to Mirpur and investigate the situation.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\n\u201cThese are very vulnerable buildings and they face the chance of damage and destruction when they are subjected to unusual forces,\u201d he said by telephone from Karachi.\n\nIn a country where a quarter of the population lives below the poverty line, Rafi said the poor bore almost the entire brunt of badly constructed buildings.\n\n\u201cMostly, only the poor are affected by the disasters, not the rich,\u201d he said.", "description": "Shoddy building construction, old housing and lax oversight leave Pakistan especially vulnerable to deadly earthquakes, experts in disasters and architecture say, and likely exacerbated damage from a tremor that killed at least 37 people.", "authors": ["Rod Nickel", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434186150&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P1DQ", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
