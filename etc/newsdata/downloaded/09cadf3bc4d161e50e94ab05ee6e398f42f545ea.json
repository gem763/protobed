The iconic game show brought the host some much needed relief during times of tragedy.\n\nWhen White's fiance, \"Young and the Restless\" star John Gibson, died in a plane crash in 1986 at 37 years old, the \"Wheel of Fortune\" host was so devastated she fell to her knees when she heard the news, according to her interview with People.\n\nBut White was able to find solace in the outpouring of support from her game show family.\n\n\"I heard from so many people who had shared the same experience of losing someone instantly in an accident, and that really helped me,\" she told People. \"I didn\u2019t feel like I was alone. Because when something like that happens, you immediately think you\u2019re the only one.\"\n\nVanna White told \"People\" magazine that her \"Wheel of Fortune\" family helped her through times of tragedy.

After marrying George Santo Pietro, the host became pregnant and announced the happy news on the show. A week later, she miscarried.\n\n\"I so wanted to be pregnant and have a baby, so then when I finally got pregnant, I wanted to tell the world immediately,\" White said. \"Obviously I lost the baby, which was devastating after announcing it. The good news is I was able to get pregnant again and had two beautiful, healthy children. \u2026 But losing a child \u2014 there\u2019s nothing good about that.\"\n\nStrong heartbeat: Hilaria Baldwin reveals she's pregnant again after miscarriage\n\nHappy birthday!
