That\u2019s probably why great love stories, when retold, don\u2019t delve into household finances. But money is a central part of any relationship. And how you deal with it (or don\u2019t) can determine whether your own tale is a short story or a novel.\n\n\u201cGetting on the same page financially is crucial to being happy and having a long-lasting marriage,\u201d says Marie O\u2019Keefe, a financial adviser at Northwestern Mutual.\n\nThat\u2019s not just lip service. A whopping 82% of engaged and newly married couples say they feel closer to their mate when they\u2019re in agreement about money, according to a survey by Northwestern Mutual and The Knot.\n\nBut that same survey found that only 37% of couples actually talk about their finances monthly. If that sounds like you and your partner, it\u2019s time to schedule a money summit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a huge proponent of financial summits\u2026especially when you\u2019re moving in with each other or getting engaged, because that\u2019s when your lives begin to merge,\u201d O\u2019Keefe says.\n\nIf you\u2019re combining households, you need to tackle day-to-day tasks like making a budget and divvying up financial responsibilities. You also need to hit the big picture stuff, namely debt and financial goals, like saving for a house, retirement, vacation, a baby or all of the above.\n\nThat first meeting might be a doozy \u2014 you have a lot of ground to cover and potentially some financial baggage to unpack \u2014 but once you get into a groove, your summits will get easier. These guidelines can keep your talk on track, even when things get uncomfortable.\n\n1. Put it on the calendar\n\nDon\u2019t spring a major financial conversation on your partner. Instead, schedule it so you both can come to the table prepared mentally and emotionally.\n\nAlso read: This state\u2019s average household now owes $10,175 in credit card debt\n\nNot every summit needs an hour or even 30 minutes \u2014 Marla Mattenson, a relationship expert, has a 15-minute check-in every Friday with her partner \u2014 but some topics warrant more time and attention.\n\nIf you\u2019re butting heads on a financial goal, for example, or need to make major adjustments to your budget, debt or retirement plan, give yourselves enough time to unpack those issues.\n\nMattenson suggests building in some buffer time, so you\u2019re not going straight from your summit into dinner with friends.\n\n\u201cYou might have emotions you need to deal with after the meeting,\u201d she says. \u201cHave some \u2018me\u2019 time or some \u2018us\u2019 time built into the after-meeting time.\u201d\n\n2. Have an agenda\n\nGiving your summit some structure will make it easier to stay on task. Mattenson likes the \u201crose, bud, thorn, earth\u201d approach.\n\nRose: Start with the stuff that\u2019s going well. Did you stick to your budget or hit a savings goal? Celebrate that!\n\nBud: Next, move onto new things to consider. Do you want to get a puppy? Need a new car? Did you just get hit with a big medical bill? Now\u2019s the time to figure out how that fits into your financial plan.\n\nThorn: Talk openly and honestly about any challenges getting in the way of your goals.\n\nEarth: This is the big picture stuff \u2014 your goals and visions for the future, and any steps you need to take to achieve them.\n\nStick to your time, even if you don\u2019t get to everything on your agenda. Better to carry things over than to carry on for hours, getting tired and frustrated as the meeting drags on.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to solve everything in the first meeting, or the third, or maybe even the 10th,\u201d O\u2019Keefe says. \u201cWrite down the things you still need to talk about and come away from each meeting with an action plan.\u201d\n\n3. Set the mood\n\nTurn off your phones. Turn off the TV. Turn on some music. Pour yourselves a drink \u2014 wine, beer, White Claw, you pick. Sit down next to each other and talk.\n\n\u201cYou want to get into the good vibes of your relationship unit,\u201d Mattenson says. \u201cSitting next to each other, it\u2019s like the two of you working together on an issue, rather than against each other.\u201d\n\nRead: How buying and selling a home could soon be as simple as trading stocks\n\nAgree to be honest, kind and judgment-free. And be attentive to any tension bubbling up. If you\u2019re getting tense or your partner is getting defensive, call a timeout. Acknowledge the tension, defuse it (a hug does wonders, Mattenson says) and get back to your agenda.\n\n\u201cIf you get into negative talk, pause and go back to kind words,\u201d Mattenson says. \u201cRemind yourselves that the most important thing is the relationship and that you\u2019re in it together.\u201d\n\nMore from NerdWallet:", "description": "Newly married couples say they feel closer to their mate when they\u2019re in agreement about money.", "authors": ["Kelsey Sheehy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR147_nerd_c_ZG_20190911171050.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
