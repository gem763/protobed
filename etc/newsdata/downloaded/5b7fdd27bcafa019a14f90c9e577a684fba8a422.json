Just a couple of weeks ago, however, the PS was ahead by 15 points and hopeful of securing an absolute majority in the Assembleia da Rep\u00fablica.\n\nAt a rally Tuesday, Costa appealed to supporters to get out and vote. He warned complacency would mean \u201cthey risk waking up the next morning with an unpleasant surprise.\u201d\n\nDespite the shrinking lead, Costa\u2019s situation must be the envy of most European Socialists.\n\nStriking a new deal with the far-left will test Costa\u2019s renowned negotiating skills.\n\nIn France, Germany and Italy, once powerful center-left parties are struggling to stay relevant in radically changed political landscapes. Britain\u2019s Labour Party is riven by division between followers and foes of hard-left leader Jeremy Corbyn. Spain\u2019s Socialist Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez is facing his fourth election in less than four years.\n\n\u201cSocialists in Portugal were able to combine wage and income increases, and to strengthen social rights previously destroyed by the right-wing government in the 'troika' years,\u201d said Iratxe Garc\u00eda, the Spanish MEP who chairs the Socialists and Democrats (S&D) group in the European Parliament.\n\n\u201cPortuguese Socialists proved that TINA [There Is No Alternative (to austerity)] is a myth,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile S\u00e1nchez has just failed, after six months of acrimonious negotiations, to find coalition partners on the right or left, Costa was able to build an unprecedented pact with two hard-left parties that took him to power in 2015 and enabled the PS to maintain a stable government for the past four years.\n\n\u201cYou think that was easy?\u201d said Ana Catarina Mendes, the PS deputy leader. \u201cWe had to demolish walls that had existed for 40 years.\u201d\n\nIt came together after the PS finished second in the 2015 election. Most people expected Costa to back the victorious center-right in a German-style \u201cgrand coalition.\u201d Instead, he broke taboos by appealing to the far left to back a Socialist administration.\n\n\u201cWe had to convince them we could have a majority of the left in parliament with one point in common: to turn the page on austerity,\u201d said Mendes. \u201cWe managed this first of all due to the leadership capacities and vision of Ant\u00f3nio Costa.\u201d\n\nCosta is convinced coalitions between centrist parties play into the hands of extremists and has again rejected talk of a deal with the PSD if, as looks likely from the polls, the PS falls short of an overall majority on Sunday.\n\nThat leaves open the prospect of a new geringon\u00e7a \u2014 a word meaning a rickety contraption which was applied to the Socialist and far-left arrangement by a conservative politician. The name has stuck even as the partnership proved robust.\n\nSame deal, different challenges\n\nStriking a new deal with the far-left will test Costa\u2019s renowned negotiating skills.\n\nHe\u2019s still on warm terms with the leader of the old-school Portuguese Communist Party, which is polling around 7 percent, but relations have soured with the Left Bloc, which is expected to win around 10 percent of the vote on Sunday.\n\nCosta has warned of a \u201cSpanish-style scenario\u201d of instability and \u201cungovernability\u201d if the elections give the Left Bloc a kingmaker role similar to that of the leftist Podemos in Spain.\n\nStill, if polls prove correct, it could be hard for the PS to form a majority without some sort of deal with the Bloc, even if Costa managed to reach out to the animal rights party PAN, which could win a couple of seats.\n\nCosta is, however, a master of backroom dealmaking.\n\n\u201cCosta is an extremely pragmatic politician,\u201d said Eunice Goes, politics professor at the U.K.\u2019s Richmond University. \u201cHe is an extremely efficient operator and a great practitioner of discrete diplomacy.\u201d\n\nPORTUGAL NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.\n\nSuccess on Sunday will mean Costa will likely lead Portugal\u2019s stint at the helm of the Council of the European Union in 2021, where, Mendes said, priorities will include forging support for a stronger European role in the fight against climate change and securing a more integrated approach to migration.\n\nCosta\u2019s domestic balancing act \u2014 assuaging leftist demands for social reforms and public spending, wage and pension hikes, while pleasing eurozone budget hawks with the lowest deficits in Portugal\u2019s democratic history \u2014 has earned him influence in Brussels and beyond.\n\nHe was successful in getting Finance Minister M\u00e1rio Centeno appointed president of the Eurogroup and played an important role lobbying for the U.N. to appoint Ant\u00f3nio Guterres as its secretary-general.\n\nCosta also got what he wanted when his chosen candidate for the European Commission, Bank of Portugal Deputy Governor Elisa Ferreira, was nominated for the regional policy post that oversees some of the EU's biggest spending programs.\n\nFerreira will have control of a new budgetary instrument for convergence and competitiveness, a mechanism Costa has long pushed for to support structural reforms and public investment.\n\n\u201cAnt\u00f3nio Costa is undoubtedly one of the most respected leaders in Europe and not only within the European socialists\u201d \u2014 Iratxe Garc\u00eda, S&D leader in the European Parliament.\n\n\u201cIn essence, the portfolio was tailor-made for the prime minister. His long-term goal \u2014 the [regional] funds portfolio \u2014 was achieved and the bonus was the inclusion of the convergence instrument,\u201d a government official said.\n\nPortuguese officials talk of supporting a \u201cprogressive alliance\u201d in Europe with an embrace that reaches from Greece\u2019s far-left Syriza to France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron. Costa himself was tapped as a possible president of the European Council when the EU\u2019s top jobs were divvied out this year.\n\n\u201cAnt\u00f3nio Costa is undoubtedly one of the most respected leaders in Europe and not only within the European socialists,\u201d said S&D leader Garc\u00eda. \u201cThe fact that his name was amongst the shortlist discussed to be the next president of the European Council is a clear proof.\"\n\nIn the end, Costa preferred to stay in Lisbon to fight for a second term.\n\nWeapons theft\n\nThat his reelection isn\u2019t the cakewalk many expected is due to the theft of dozens of anti-tank grenades, plastic explosives, high-caliber ammunition and other weapons from an army base at Tancos, northeast of Lisbon, in 2017.\n\nThe hardware was found a few months later but allegations emerged that military police had done a deal with the thieves to recover the loot. Last week, four days into the election campaign, prosecutors announced Costa\u2019s former defense minister, Jos\u00e9 Azeredo Lopes, was among 23 facing charges in the case.\n\nSince then, the Tancos affair has dominated the campaign, injecting rancor into hitherto polite exchanges between Costa and opposition leader Rui Rio. The center-right chief on Monday demanded an urgent parliamentary debate on \u201cthe suspicion of connivance by the prime minister.\u201d\n\nCosta in a corner has been characteristically pugnacious. He accused Rio of \u201cbringing shame upon himself\u201d and \u201cundermining the dignity of the campaign\u201d by suggesting he was in on the military shenanigans.\n\nThe campaign\u2019s toxic turn could make it harder for Costa to cobble together another governing contraption, but few underestimate his dexterity and determination to stay in the job.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be right to say I\u2019m only going to govern if I get one or other set of conditions,\u201d he told the CMTV network last week. \u201cI\u2019ll govern with whatever conditions that the Portuguese give me to govern with.\u201d", "description": "Despite a shrinking poll lead, Portugal\u2019s Socialists look set to buck trend of center-left decline in national election.", "authors": ["Paul Ames", "Ivo Oliveira"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1170849973-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
