Milenio broadcast a photograph that it said showed Ovidio Guzman in detention.\n\nPresident Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters his security cabinet would give information about the situation in Sinaloa later on Thursday.\n\nState police confirmed to Reuters that several prisoners escaped from a prison during the chaos, which lasted for hours. Video footage showed a group of at least 20 people running in the streets. It was not immediately clear how many had escaped.\n\nVehicles and a petrol station were set on fire while cartel gunmen roamed the city in trucks, at least one of which was armed with a mounted machine gun, videos posted on social media showed. Civilians hid in the aisles of a supermarket, while other ran for cover in leafy suburban streets.\n\nState police said there were no confirmed deaths, although two videos broadcast on Milenio showed men lying in the streets, apparently lifeless.
