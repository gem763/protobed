The explosive news hit over the weekend that a government whistleblower filed an official complaint to the intelligence community inspector general alleging that, on multiple occasions, President Trump attempted to pressure the president of Ukraine. Specifically, that allegation continued, the president pressured Ukraine to investigate the son of his potential Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, by threatening to withhold foreign aid to that country. While the Muller Report made it clear to most Democrats that no bar was too low for Trump and his team in order to get to the White House, even Republicans are admitting that the Commander-in-Chief is now just getting sloppy.\n\nThis is the news that many of Trump\u2019s critics have been waiting for. His alleged actions as president are the now the most serious on a continuum of what should have been impeachment-triggering events, starting with his actions as a private citizen, which are detailed in the Muller Report and were presented to Congress in July. A week ago, the Manhattan District Attorney subpoenaed eight years of Trump's financial records for a possible criminal investigation into hush money payments that were made to a porn actor during his presidential campaign. Things are definitely getting worse.\n\nCalls to impeach the 45th president are louder than ever. Indeed, at least 137 lawmakers in the House of Representatives have stated that they support impeaching Trump, while Republican members of Congress continue to gaslight the American people.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, remains hesitant. In an interview with National Public Radio on Friday she lamented a Department of Justice (DOJ) Memorandum that prohibits a sitting president from being indicted on criminal charges. She also argued for Congress to pass a law that would allow for a president to be criminally indicted \u2013 a measure Republicans would surely support if a Democratic president were accused of lesser misdeeds.\n\nPelosi is right about three things: first, she should be worried about alienating Democrats and losing their majority in the House of Representatives. Second, she\u2019s right thatTrump will not face criminal justice while in office: the DOJ memo makes that clear. And third, she\u2019s correct when she says that, in spite of a House impeachment, the Republican-controlled Senate wouldn't move forward with conviction proceedings (the second part of the Congressional impeachment process).\n\nBut the Speaker\u2019s reasoning is also flawed.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

An impeachment (even without a conviction) could serve as an important precedent for later criminal investigations into Trump's dealings before and during his presidency. But more importantly, impeachment is a critical precedent for future holders of the Oval Office who chose to abuse their executive powers for political and financial gain.\n\nIn other words, to provide evidence to convict Trump later, as well as demonstrate to Americans and the world that the concept of Rule of Law still holds meaning in our democracy, Congress has no choice but to proceed with the impeachment process.\n\nTo those who say impeachment is futile because of the DOJ memo: I agree. But Trump can still face justice once he is out of office. We know from the case of Nixon vs. US that the president is not above the law, even while in office. In that 1974 landmark case, then-president Richard Nixon argued that executive privilege and national security shielded him from having to share confidential White House conversations from the 1972 break-in of the Democratic National Committee headquarters (which Nixon ordered). The Supreme Court didn\u2019t agree with Nixon and concluded that argument for executive privilege doesn\u2019t necessarily override the \u201cfundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice.\u201d Nixon resigned before he could face an impeachment and conviction process.\n\nAgain, to those who argue that Nixon\u2019s case was different: I agree. Nixon didn\u2019t have blind support of the Senate, as Trump does; Nixon knew he was going down. But what about the importance of impeachment as a democratic process? Just look at Bill Clinton, who was impeached for lying about having extramarital affairs while in the Oval Office to Congress, which, while incredibly distasteful and unethical, hardly rises to the level of Trump\u2019s alleged abuse. Furthermore, if we don\u2019t pursue impeachment for Trump under such extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances, the process is stripped of its meaning and is damaging to the integrity of our democracy.\n\nIt\u2019s true \u2013 we are hardly nearing Trump\u2019s final act. The corrupt and lecherous wizard of reality television who now holds the country hostage with his Twitter rants, ICE raids and foreign policy circus certainly has more tricks up his sleeve. But regardless of whether Trump and his cronies win the next round of elections, at some point Donald Trump will once again be a private, legally prosecutable citizen, and those who helped him hide his crimes will have to account for their actions.\n\nAn impeachment on Trump\u2019s record will make him more vulnerable to criminal indictment at some point and will subject him to public humiliation; it is the modern equivalent of tarring and feathering the sovereign. But more important than subjecting the fragile ego that sits in the Oval Office to public shaming, more important even than Trump\u2019s criminal record, is the fact that Democratic leaders need to remember this country is supposed to stand for the Rule of Law. Americans need to be reassured that regardless of the eminence of the position, those who abuse their official powers shall face some form of justice.\n\nOur democracy depends on it.", "description": "There were those who said the Trump administration couldn\u2019t get any worse, but last week they did.", "authors": ["Carli Pierson"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/23/09/ap-19265821140472.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
