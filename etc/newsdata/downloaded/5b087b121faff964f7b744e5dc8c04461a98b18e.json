Now I know for certain which account/individual it's come from.\n\n\"I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them.\n\n\"It's... Rebekah Vardy's account.\"\n\nColeen's post on Twitter had more than 12,000 retweets and 42,000 likes within an hour of it being uploaded.\n\nRebekah Vardy has responded to the claims in a message back to Coleen.\n\nShe denied it was her and said she wishes Coleen had spoken to her directly about her suspicion as she would have changed the password to her account.\n\n\"Over the years various people have had access to my Insta and just this week I found I was following people I didn't know or have never followed myself,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm not being funny but I don't need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you?\"\n\nShe added: \"I'm disgusted that I'm even having to deny this. You should've called me the first time it happened.\"\n\nThe Sun newspaper said it did not want to comment on the claim.\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.", "description": "Rebekah - the wife of Leicester City's Jamie Vardy - denies she has leaked stories to a tabloid.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/95CA/production/_109164383_coleenrebekah976.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
