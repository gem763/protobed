'There is many a time I'm watching a game thinking, \"go on, get a move on, get in the box\" and he is holding his run, holding his run and he's ended up tucking it in and I've had to go to myself \"maybe he is a better striker than me\".\n\n'It was a tough season for us. We had a bad spell and he stayed consistent. He was fighting for me which doesn't always happen.\n\n'18, does he really care whether Lee Johnson is the manager or not? He did. That is a sign of his maturity and also his moral compass. He was always first out, last in. He loved finishing.'\n\nWith first-team opportunities thin on the ground, Abraham went on a series of loan spells\n\nHe won promotion with Aston Villa - enough to show Frank Lampard he could be the main man\n\nThings were much tougher in his first stab at the Premier League at Swansea who had less of the ball, created fewer chances and suffered relegation. He scored eight goals that season and just one in the league after October.\n\nAbraham, now 22, is remembered fondly at Swansea though. Their and his struggles never got the naturally upbeat front man down.\n\nThere was an acceptance that scoring goals for Swansea back then would have been a tough ask for an experienced striker never mind one still trying to find his feet at senior level.\n\nIt has gone down as a loan that came too early in his development, a club he joined at the wrong time in their history but, still, a valuable experience.\n\n'That's where you learn and become a man quicker,' he reflected last season. 'It's not just always going to be easy and winning games, you have to go through the downside as well.'\n\nHis confidence in his ability to score remained and the goals flowed the following season at Aston Villa, another 26 back in the second tier to help the Midlanders to promotion via the play-offs\n\nDespite that, there were some, even at Villa Park, who were among those who harboured doubts about whether Abraham could replicate that form in the top-flight.\n\nAfter a goalless start to the season Abraham started answering all his doubters in Chelsea's 3-2 win at Norwich, his fourth appearance of the campaign.\n\nAbraham started answering all his doubters with a fine display in Chelsea's 3-2 win at Norwich\n\nBut he was the target of disgusting racial abuse following his Super Cup penalty miss in August\n\nHe scored twice that day, his first Premier League goals for Chelsea. His opener, a sweetly-struck half volley, was followed by a huge embrace with Frank Lampard.\n\nEven in his short time as Chelsea head coach Lampard has played a big part in Abraham's development. Firstly, Lampard showed huge faith in him by installing him as Chelsea's No 1 striker.\n\nHe has also continued the work that begun when Abraham excelled after going full-time at Chelsea 'to get his technique in line with his athleticism and personality,' which former youth coach Michael Beale, a huge Abraham fan, praises both the player and club's coaches for.\n\nLampard has worked with him closely on elements of his game after training including his shooting from outside the box, an attribute Abraham revealed last season he was also trying to improve by studying the likes of England captain Harry Kane.\n\nAt Norwich, Abraham scored his first ever league goal from outside the box, having scored more than 50 previously from inside it.\n\nWithin the meaning of the touchline hug would also have been acknowledgment from Abraham for his manager's support after he was the target of disgusting racial abuse following his Super Cup penalty miss against Liverpool in August.\n\n'I think I dealt with it in the best way possible,' Abraham said this week. 'Stayed away from Twitter and all social media, I just spent time with my team-mates and my family.\n\n'It's not acceptable. But whoever doesn't have my personality might be affected more. I stayed away, ignored it and just let the football do the talking.'\n\nFrank Lampard has been unwavering in his support of the striker and is reaping the rewards\n\nAbraham could make his competitive debut for England against the Czech Republic on Friday\n\nAll Abraham is getting now is widespread praise and his rise has delighted so many people.\n\nNot least his parents Marian and Anthony who have been credited with keeping him grounded. Anthony is in the stands for every Abraham game, wherever he plays.\n\nHis infectious, bubbly nature, humility and politeness have made him popular at every club he has been at, with everyone he meets and somebody people want to do well.\n\nAbraham is part of a group of Chelsea youngsters who are making their mark in the first team this season and have noticeably wise heads on young shoulders.\n\nThey are such a credit to Chelsea's academy and good examples of how to carry yourself the club and handle life in the spotlight the club have discussed using them to help in future media training sessions with their academy players despite still being young themselves.\n\nAbraham's personality is also summed up by another memory from Beale, who is now at Rangers and was head of Chelsea's local development centres in south London when the striker first joined the club.\n\n'He celebrated goals [while at the academy] like he scored a winner in the Premier League,' Beale said.\n\nNow Abraham is scoring them for real in the top flight, Southgate simply couldn't keep him out of his squad.", "description": "ADRIAN KAJUMBA: Tammy Abraham is thriving as Chelsea's main striker and England manager Gareth Southgate simply couldn't keep him out of his squad for October's fixtures.", "authors": ["Max Winters For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/18/19552160-0-image-a-9_1570730063439.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
