There are virtually no surprises in this dutiful biography, which could easily be a sort of gender-switch \"A Star is Born,\" only with Garland portraying the aging superstar.\n\nSet in 1969 -- three decades after she donned the ruby slippers -- the movie opens with Garland and her children being ousted from the hotel where they're residing, forcing the kids to move in with her ex, Sid Luft (Rufus Sewell), and Judy to grudgingly take a gig performing in London, seeking to restore her finances to a place where she can be their live-in mom again.\n\n\"I'm unreliable, and uninsurable,\" she says flatly, when someone suggests that she do another movie.\n\nGetting her on stage, however, is no simple task, as Garland's pill-popping habit lingers, the roots of which are traced to her days as a contract player at MGM, in heartbreaking flashbacks that depict the young Judy (Darci Shaw) being verbally abused and bullied by legendary studio boss Louis B. Mayer (Richard Cordery), circa \"The Wizard of Oz.\"\n\nFilled with need, anger and apprehensions, Judy receives some support from Rosalyn (Jessie Buckley), the Brit assigned to wrangle her, but that's balanced against the young woman's mandate to do her job, which is to find a way to ensure that Garland appears every night, regardless of her condition. The remarkable part is that when it all clicks, the entertainer can still dazzle an audience, though with the pharmaceutical complications involved, the process never stops being a crapshoot.\n\nRead More", "description": "Renee Zellweger hits high note with Judy Garland biography", "authors": ["Brian Lowry"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190510103757-01-renee-zellweger-judy-garland-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
