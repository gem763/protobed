A tiny black strappy onesie with revealing cutouts had her name all over it as New York Fashion Week reached its midway point on a shortened, six-day schedule.\n\nSporty was the name of Ford\u2019s game for spring 2020, in elevated ball caps and leather biker jackets of black and cream. Wide elastic-waist trousers came in several colors, including neon orange, lime and red, the latter paired with a sculpted breastplate of a crop top that defined his model\u2019s chest in the same hue.\n\nFord put wide pleats on the front of voluminous long skirts and offered plenty of New Yorkers\u2019 favorite color: black. His female models wore spiked updos and his men rocked shades as actor Ansel Elgort, Anna Wintour and Diane von Furstenberg also looked on.\n\nBowery and Delancey streets may never be the same, nor the Metropolitan Transit Authority workers in safety vests who stood watching on the tracks.\n\nFord claimed a few key inspirations that he made his own, including a 1965 photo of Andy Warhol and muse Edie Sedgwick coming out of a manhole in New York. Also on his mood wall were shots of Isabelle Adjani and Christophe Lambert in Luc Besson\u2019s film \u201cSubway,\u201d set in the Paris metro.\n\n\u201cI remember so clearly when the film came out thinking how cool they both looked,\u201d Ford said in his show notes. \u201cEspecially the hair.\u201d\n\nFord recalled a scene where a bourgeois man at a dinner table asked Adjani what she called her hair style and she replied dryly: \u201cIroquois.\u201d\n\nThere were other Sedgwick images that inspired him, including one of her in a silver bra and silver pants from the mid \u201860s. Also on his wall: Ursula Andress in a shiny metal bra from the Italian film \u201cThe 10th Victim.\u201d\n\nHe looked back to the \u201cbreathtakingly beautiful\u201d Yves Saint Laurent-Claude Lalanne breastplates YSL showed for autumn-winter 1969. The sculptress made casts of model Veruschka\u2019s chest and stomach.\n\nFord also pinned to his wall while working on his latest collection a photo of the Jeff Koons\u2019 polished steel bunny that sold for $91 million at Sotheby\u2019s this year. Ford\u2019s array of colors was drawn from Koons\u2019 \u201cBalloon Dog\u201d sculptures.\n\nBut, really, he was striving for one prevailing vibe.\n\n\u201cThis season for me is about simplicity,\u201d Ford said. \u201cWhich is not to be confused with simple. I think that it is a time for ease, and in that way a return to the kind of luxurious sportswear that America has become known for all over the world.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "All aboard!", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Leanne Italie"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/fashion_tom_ford_97569_c0-229-5472-3419_s1770x1032.jpg?6f9ce78ee1a3a25672569ab4bf84dc3559d8855e", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
