The fastest journey time is four hours, 13 minutes.\n\nThe pressure group Flight Free UK says: \u201cFlying is the fastest growing cause of climate change. If aviation was a country, it would be the seventh worst polluter globally.\n\n\u201cBrits already fly more than the people of any other nation \u2013 twice as much as Americans.\n\n\u201cEven if we take other steps to be environmentally friendly, one flight can completely wipe out all the other savings.\u201d", "description": "As the clamour grows for terrestrial transport to replace air travel, Britain\u2019s biggest budget airline has announced a new route from Birmingham to Edinburgh.
