MIT scientists have now designed a virus that they can tweak to target several E. coli superbugs - and potentially other infections, too (file)\n\nAntibiotics transformed modern medicine, turning infections that were once almost uniformly fatal to ones that could be treated in as little as a few days.\n\nBut just s we learned to outsmart bacteria, bacteria has, in its way learned to outsmart our medicines.\n\nEven within a single species of bacteria, there is variation.\n\nAnd when antibiotics accurately target and kill off the majority of bacteria in an infection, the ones left - the ones that were slightly different from most - multiply, and become more prevalent.\n\nThe antibiotics are a poor match for these mutant bacteria, which continue to survive and multiply.\n\nAs more bacteria are exposed to antibiotics, the effect is a sort of 'survival of the fittest': increasingly, the bacteria strains left and spreading are the ones that are immune to antibiotics.\n\nSo over-prescribing antibiotics only drives up the rate of resistance.\n\nAnd some infections even become resistant to all antibiotics - a death sentence.\n\nHOW DO ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANT BACTERIA GET INTO OUR FOOD? Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are those which have developed to be strong enough to survive treatment with previously effective medicines. Exposure to antibiotics in small amounts or when there is no infection increases the risk of bacteria getting used to the medicine. Farm animals being kept to produce meat are sometimes fed antibiotics, many of which are the same as those used to treat humans, to make them grow larger faster. In a natural environment, animals would be exposed to bacteria and then use energy to fight off infection and build up immunity. Antibiotics remove the need for this immune reaction by killing bacteria immediately, meaning more of the animal's energy can be used for the body to grow larger. Therefore, the farmer gets more meat. However, bacteria are becoming resistant to these antibiotics because they're constantly exposed to them, meaning the antibiotic-resistant bacteria \u2013 the superbugs \u2013 build up inside the animal. These are then passed into the human food chain when the animals are slaughtered and sold as meat, or in their milk or if their manure is used to fertilise crop farms.\n\n\n\nThe result is that at least two million Americans develop antibiotic resistant infections every year, and at least 23,000 of them die.\n\nScientists have been unable to develop new antibiotics fast enough to keep up with the mutations of bacteria.\n\nAnd even if they could, these new drugs would just face the same problem all over again.\n\nSo researchers are in search of a novel method for treating these deadly infections.\n\nOne such method is the use of bacteriophages - viruses whose name, in Greek, means 'to devour bacteria.'\n\nEach particular bacteriophage has a taste for a particular bacterium.\n\nSo researchers have been studying them with growing interest to see if they can be programmed to attack the bacteria that antibiotics cannot.\n\nThe MIT programmed theirs to go after drug-resistant E. coli.\n\nThey created a 'scaffold,' of framework for the virus that they can effectively plug different genes into to program it to attack specific bacteria.\n\n'We think phages are a good toolkit for killing and knocking down bacteria levels inside a complex ecosystem, but in a targeted way,' said lead study author Dr Timothy Lu, a biological engineer.\n\nOut of 10,000 different phages that Dr Lu and his team created, they found several of their new viruses could kill even mutated, antibiotic resistant E. coli.\n\n'This is just the beginning, as there are many other viral scaffolds and bacteria to target,' said Dr Kevin Yehl, a postdoc fellow in the MIT lab and study co-lead author.", "description": "The World Health Organization considers antibiotic resistance a leading threat to global health.
