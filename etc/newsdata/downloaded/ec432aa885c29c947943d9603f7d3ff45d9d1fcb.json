And we\u2019re still getting up.\u201d\n\nShe said the wounds of failure hurt deeply but healed with time, and if women acknowledged their scars they could encourage younger girls to strive and succeed.\n\nThe Post reported that while Obama largely stayed away from politics, she received cheers from the crowd when she took a few thinly veiled shots at the Trump administration, and boos when she reiterated that she would not be seeking public office.\n\n\u201cPublic service and engagement will be a part of my life and my husband\u2019s life for ever,\u201d she added. Both Michelle and Barack Obama have signed book deals with Penguin Random House.\n\nThe former lawyer warned against the notion of a nation falling apart, saying that America was a young country that would learn from its mistakes and successes.\n\n\u201cThe people in this country are universally good and kind and honest and decent. Don\u2019t be afraid of the country you live in. The folks here are good,\u201d she said, adding that instead of relying on national policies, women needed to take charge in their own lives and communities.\n\nShe also talked on a range of topics she advocated for as first lady, including education for girls and health and nutrition for schoolchildren.\n\n\u201cIf we want girls in Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), we need to rethink how we deliver education. Teachers, a kind word can mean the world to a young girl,\u201d she said.\n\nAs first lady, Obama launched several campaigns around education, including Reach Higher, which inspires students to complete education past high school, and Let Girls Learn, which helps facilitate educational opportunities for young girls in developing countries.\n\nIn May, she made her strongest political intervention by attacking the Trump administration\u2019s reversal of regulations to help improve school lunches.\n\nAddressing the crowd in Denver, she mentioned Barack Obama\u2019s campaign slogan. \u201cIt was never \u2018yes he can\u2019; it was \u2018yes we can\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we put so much on a person, on a leader, we absolve ourselves of doing anything else. We\u2019re all on a journey together \u2026 We all want someone who will fix things, but we\u2019re going to have to fix it together.\u201d\n\nShe advised people to surround themselves with other powerful figures and never be afraid to fail and to protect what they love. \u201cWhat is going on within us [women] that we don\u2019t feel worthy enough to protect the things we value?\u201d she asked.\n\n", "description": "Pretending experiences didn\u2019t hurt would let perpetrators off hook, says Obama as she praises women\u2019s strength", "authors": ["Nadia Khomami"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f04b690904dc6972c1418921fb66ee29f5b48086/0_159_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=106f3ea46764aa1e53dd349e92118294", "published_at": "2017-07-27"}
