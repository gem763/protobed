No one can honestly doubt that the Russian government is trying to foster chaos and disunity in the United States. Certainly it has preferred presidential candidates. If the Russians think there is something to be gained by indirectly or directly supporting someone, why wouldn\u2019t they?\n\nYou\u2019re a conspiracy theorist, as the saying goes, only if there isn\u2019t a conspiracy.\n\nEven so, it is a terrible thing to label candidates as \u201cRussian assets\u201d based on their views alone. It actually helps create its own kind of propaganda victory for foreign rivals, by replacing serious policy debate with rumor-mongering and suggestions of disloyalty.", "description": "The problem is not just paranoia. It\u2019s also that she questioned a candidate\u2019s motives rather than the soundness of her views.", "authors": ["Tim Wu"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/21/opinion/21Wu/21Wu-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
