Brian Clough won the old First Division with both Derby and Nottingham Forest, while Kenny Dalglish delivered three First Divisions with Liverpool as well as a Premier League title with Blackburn, but it remains to be seen whether Mourinho can be the first to do the business with a third team.", "description": "The Portuguese has turned down a number of jobs as he continues to wait for the perfect opening in England", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Sky Sports", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20666552.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_DMP_CHP__21765PunditsJPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
