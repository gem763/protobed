However, the company began opening up physical stores in 2012.

In a panel with Business of Home columnist and podcaster Dennis Scully and Interior Define chairman and founder Rob Royer, Dunn talked about why he's changed his thinking.\n\nDunn called e-commerce a \"tremendously challenging, frequently unprofitable business,\" saying that companies that are solely focused on establishing an online business may be missing out on meeting customers' needs.\n\n\"It also doesn't take into account how much consumers still want to be in person with brands and products and people,\" Dunn said.\n\nHe said that, in the case of Bonobos, the brand's \"most profitable business\" today is its partnership with Nordstrom. Bonobos now also boasts 66 brick-and-mortar stores known as \"guides shops.\"\n\n\"That is something that would have been antithetical when we started,\" he said.", "description": "Andy Dunn, a Walmart executive who founded Bonobos, said that e-commerce outfits often underestimate the benefits of brick-and-mortar.", "authors": ["\u00c1ine Cain"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d767dfd2e22af7e835960e4-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
