(Mindaugas Kulbis/AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nIt was reported recently that Secretary of Energy Rick Perry will be leaving the Trump administration by year\u2019s end. Many people responded to this news with some version of \u201cOh, yeah, Rick Perry, I forgot about him.\u201d Perry had managed to avoid the fate of many Trump appointees who departed after being disgraced by their own petty corruption, or falling into disfavor and being sacked after a vigorous public humiliation on the president\u2019s Twitter feed. But that doesn\u2019t mean he hasn\u2019t been busy.\n\nAnd, as a stunning new article from the Associated Press reveals, Perry has been rather active in, you guessed it, Ukraine.\n\nIt\u2019s a complicated story involving a bunch of different characters, including Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s \u201clawyer.\u201d The most newsworthy part is that Perry reportedly urged the Ukrainian government to fire the board of its state-owned gas company, Naftogaz, and install on the board some Americans who had given large donations to the Republican Party \u2014 in apparent furtherance of their interests and those of some other large GOP donors who happen to be Giuliani\u2019s clients.\n\nFeel free to read that again. Then remember that the Republican line is that all the pressure being put on the Ukrainians is because President Trump and his administration are so passionately opposed to corruption.\n\nI\u2019ll try to give an extremely brief synopsis. Giuliani has two clients, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, Soviet-born real estate entrepreneurs from Florida who are in partnership with an oil magnate named Harry Sargeant III; they\u2019re trying to get a deal to import liquefied natural gas to Ukraine. All have given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Republicans, and while Giuliani was running around Ukraine trying to gin up an investigation of Joe Biden and his son Hunter, the three were trying to get the Naftogaz CEO removed so that an executive more friendly to their own ambitions to sell liquefied ] natural gas to Ukraine could be installed.\n\nThe AP reports that Sargeant reportedly told this Ukrainian executive \u201cthat he regularly meets with Trump at Mar-a-Lago and that the gas-sales plan had the president\u2019s full support.\u201d The executive \u201cperceived it to be a shakedown.\u201d At the same time, Parnas was going around telling people that the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovich, was about to be removed because she wasn\u2019t friendly enough to their business interests. Months later, Trump did indeed recall Yovanovich from her post. \u201cThe ambassador to Ukraine was replaced,\u201d Giuliani told reporters. \u201cI did play a role in that.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s where Rick Perry comes in, on his own trip to Ukraine:\n\nA second meeting during the trip, at a Kyiv hotel, included Ukrainian officials and energy sector people. There, Perry made clear that the Trump administration wanted to see the entire Naftogaz supervisory board replaced, according to a person who attended both meetings. Perry again referenced the list of advisers that he had given [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskiy, and it was widely interpreted that he wanted Michael Bleyzer, a Ukrainian-American businessman from Texas, to join the newly formed board, the person said. Also on the list was Robert Bensh, another Texan who frequently works in Ukraine, the Energy Department confirmed.\n\nBleyzer is also a big Republican donor. So what we appear to have here is: Some clients of Giuliani want to change the leadership of the Ukrainian state gas company so it will be more amenable to them making money, and the secretary of energy tries to get the board of that company fired so that some of his own buddies can be installed \u2014 surely in furtherance of their own financial interests.\n\nWe should note at this point that the Energy Department says Perry was merely encouraging Ukraine to become a welcoming environment for American business, which is not an uncommon thing for American officials to do.\n\nBut that\u2019s rather different from strong-arming a foreign government \u2014 one unusually dependent on the United States at this point in its history \u2014 to hire some of your party\u2019s donors.\n\nAnd I\u2019m sure that when Perry leaves office, he\u2019ll be given positions on the boards of a half-dozen fossil fuel companies grateful for the service he has provided.\n\nThe natural takeaway from this story is that the Trump administration is spectacularly corrupt, which isn\u2019t exactly news. But we should also spare a thought for Ukraine and its government. They\u2019re trying to hold off Russia, their much more powerful and hostile neighbor, while the country that they hope will protect them keeps trying to shake them down. We\u2019ll send you those missiles if you investigate Trump\u2019s political opponent. We\u2019ll be there for you if you put a few of our guys on the board of your natural gas company.\n\nIn other words, a country that\u2019s been held back by corruption now wants to do something about it, yet in comes the American government with requests that they be more corrupt if doing so will help President Trump and the GOP. It\u2019s a cruel and tragic irony.\n\nRead more:\n\nPaul Waldman: Supreme Court may gut abortion rights in the middle of the campaign\n\nPaul Waldman: We\u2019re one step closer to seeing Trump\u2019s tax returns", "description": "Don't they have enough problems?", "authors": ["Paul Waldman", "Opinion Writer Covering Politics", "Opinion Writer", "October At Pm", "Paul Waldman Is An Opinion Writer For The Plum Line Blog."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/GobqaoiceiJkjiT5M88yauPENWI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SFPHWGXI7MI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
