(John Amis, File/Associated Press)\n\nPLAINS, Ga. \u2014 Former President Jimmy Carter fell Sunday at his home in Georgia and needed some stitches above his brow, but \u201cfeels fine,\u201d his spokeswoman said.\n\nDeanna Congileo said in an email that the 39th president fell Sunday in Plains, Georgia, and received stitches. Carter turned 95 on Tuesday, becoming the first U.S. president to reach that milestone.\n\nCongileo said Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, who is 92, were eager to be at a Habitat for Humanity build in Nashville, Tennessee. The opening ceremony for the project was scheduled for Sunday evening and it runs through Friday.\n\nCarter survived a dire cancer diagnosis in 2015 and surpassed George H.W. Bush as the longest-lived U.S. president in history this spring. He has had some trouble walking after a hip replacement in May, but regularly teaches Sunday School.\n\nMeanwhile, he has continued with his humanitarian work. And he also has occasionally weighed in on politics and policy, recently expressing hopes that his Carter Center will become a more forceful advocate against armed conflicts in the future, including \u201cwars by the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just want to keep the whole world at peace,\u201d Carter had said as he presented his annual Carter Center report last month.\n\n\u201cWe have been at war more than 226 years. We have been at peace for about 16 years\u201d since the Declaration of Independence in 1776, he said, adding that every U.S. military conflict from the Korean War onward has been a war of \u201cchoice.\u201d\n\nCarter also has been accepting visits from several 2020 presidential candidates, but he\u2019s held back on endorsing any of his fellow Democrats, offering only clues to his thinking.\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
