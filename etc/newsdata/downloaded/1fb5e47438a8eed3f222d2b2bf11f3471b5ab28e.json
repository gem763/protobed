This was a thrilling, breathtaking contest featuring fine play by both teams, an exceptional goal by Harry Kane, two goals disallowed by VAR, a terrific equaliser by Ricardo Pereira and a late strike by James Maddison that can only do Leicester good as they strive to upset the Premier League\u2019s established order again.\n\nTottenham will feature plenty in the highlights but ultimately left deflated, having let another lead slip on the road.\n\nLeicester 2-1 Tottenham: Premier League \u2013 live reaction! Read more\n\nIt was not hard to detect discordant clanks in the mood music around Spurs going into this game. Mauricio Pochettino had made no effort to mask his anger with the way his team frittered away a two-goal lead during Wednesday\u2019s Champions League excursion to Olympiakos. Spurs\u2019 away form in the Premier League was even more of an irritant, his term winless on their travels since beating Fulham in January. They looked on course to improve their record when Kane put them in front with a remarkable finish in the first half, but the visitors proved unable to suppress a thrilling fightback from Brendan Rodgers\u2019 team.\n\nPochettino made six changes to the Spurs lineup that had started in Greece \u2013 with Christian Eriksen demoted to the bench, Dele Alli omitted from the squad and Hugo Lloris away on paternity leave, meaning Paulo Gazzaniga started in goal. The manager must have been satisfied with the start made by his revamped side, who swarmed over the hosts from the outset. What followed was a contest of top-class intensity and when the opening goal came, it was extraordinary.\n\nIt stated when Erik Lamela threaded a pass through to Heung-min Son, who backheeled into the path of Kane. A shunt in the back from the retreating Caglar S\u00f6y\u00fcnc\u00fc unbalanced Kane and the striker was falling as he beat Jonny Evans on the edge of the area. Kane was practically horizontal when Kasper Schmeichel rushed out to meet him but the striker\u2019s instinct overrode any inclination to claim a penalty and he instead brought down his right leg on the ball in a chopping motion, hitting it in the ground and over the goalkeeper. It was marvellous improvisation.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Harry Kane scores to give Tottenham the first-half lead, despite having slipped over in the area.

The decision was a correct and came as a mighty relief to Gazzaniga, whose failure to hold a shot by Youri Tielemans enabled Ayoze P\u00e9rez to set up Wilfred Ndidi. But P\u00e9rez turned out to have been offside when Tielemans opened fire.\n\nTottenham had been the first to threaten. Lamela, conniving at the tip of the visitors\u2019 midfield diamond, sent a neat pass through to Son, who dragged a shot wide of the far post from 10 yards. Kane\u2019s first effort came a minute later, but it was a banal one from 20 yards that Schmeichel caught without fuss.\n\nBanality, though, had no place in the rest of this game, which was played with exhilarating tempo, power and offensive intent. Paul Tierney did well to help the players keep the gripping action on the right side of the law, although the home crowd reckoned Moussa Sissoko should have been sent off rather than cautioned after taking the ball and Maddison with a two-footed challenge in the first half.\n\nSpurs went into the break in front but knew the game remained very much in the balance. Tielemans underlined the danger posed by the home side when he released Jamie Vardy early in the second half. Jan Vertonghen did well to keep up with the striker and get a nick on his shot, allowing Gazzaniga to make a plunging save. Danny Rose tidied up before P\u00e9rez could pounce. Moments later Son should have increased Spurs\u2019 lead on the counterattack but fluffed his chance after being put through by Harry Winks.\n\nManchester City v Watford, Premier League and more: clockwatch \u2013 live!

But Son had been offside by a matter of millimetres in the buildup, so VAR did its thing again.\n\nThen, in the 70th minute, Pereira scored a goal with which no one could quibble. It originated in another slick Leicester attack, with Maddison and Harvey Barnes involved before Vardy fizzed a low pass from the left to Pereira, who rammed the ball into the net.\n\nMaddison seized victory for the home team by collecting a pass from Hamza Choudhury and lashing a low shot into the net from over 20 yards.", "description": "Goals from Ricardo Pereira and James Maddison sealed the points as Leicester won 2-1 against Tottenham, who went ahead through Harry Kane", "authors": ["Paul Doyle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3e1abe2f0a20f407c5a9dbeb25e1c645274700c/0_121_3628_2177/master/3628.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8bc9490fa33ff7ed474e72cb9e5ff815", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
