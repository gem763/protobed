It\u2019s puzzling when everybody knows the answer to that question of whether her plan and Senator [Bernie] Sanders\u2019 plan will raise middle-class taxes is \u2018yes.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s just the latest instance of Buttigieg beginning to draw sharper contrasts with his rivals as his campaign appears to have stalled a bit among the 2020 field. In the days since last week\u2019s primary debate in Houston, Buttigieg also sparred with former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke over O\u2019Rourke\u2019s insistence that he would impose a mandatory federal buyback of assault weapons if elected president.\n\nWarren and Buttigieg fall into different camps among Democratic White House contenders when it comes to health care. While Warren has been among the few candidates who still backs Sanders\u2019 single-payer model, Buttigieg has taken a more moderate lane, releasing a plan on Thursday that he has dubbed \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It.\u201d\n\nIn Buttigieg\u2019s plan, he elaborates on ideas he has touched on during his presidential campaign, such as building on Obamacare and creating a \u201cpublic option\u201d to compete with private insurers.\n\nThe price tag of a single-payer plan like \u201cMedicare for All\u201d has been among the chief criticisms of its opponents, who have also bashed it because such a system would eliminate private insurers. But Warren and Sanders have defended the idea by arguing that Americans would end up saving in the long run by having their total out-of-pocket costs reduced. Warren has also said that her proposed tax on the ultrawealthy would help shoulder the costs.\n\nButtigieg said on Thursday that he is confident his proposal is the smartest way to reshape the health care market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeking to attack the problem of affordability from several angles,\u201d he explained. That means looking at insurance \u201cbut also looking at what\u2019s driving those costs in the first place. And I really do believe the public alternative will be better.\u201d\n\nAnd, he added, it\u2019s possible that his plan could \u201cwell be the glide path that leads to a Medicare for All environment.\u201d He contended that he wants people to have a choice between his public option or maintaining their current coverage through a private insurer.\n\n\u201cI think ours will be better,\u201d he asserted. \u201cIf we\u2019re right, Americans can decide that for themselves.\u201d", "description": "\u201cAnyone who lets the words Medicare for All escape their lips should tell us just as plainly how they plan to get there,\u201d Buttigieg wrote.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/97/07/757d900846f0bfe9d46698a81d87/19919-pete-buttigieg-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
