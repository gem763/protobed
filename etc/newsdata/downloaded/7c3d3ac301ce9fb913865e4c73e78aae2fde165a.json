In my 70 years, I have never seen a president slandered and defamed in this way. with one Democrat lying about it and 10 others swearing to it. The biggest offenders are Jerry Nadler, Chuck Schumer, Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi.\n\nMessrs. Nadler and Schiff said they saw evidence of President Trump\u2019s collusion in the Russia investigation so, why didn\u2019t the Mueller report mention them submitting said evidence to the investigators? Either they knowingly withheld pertinent evidence in a criminal investigation and obstructed justice, or they lied, violating their oaths of office and committing misfeasance and malfeasance, and should be brought before an ethics commission.\n\nMrs. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer, the other two pathological liars in the group, have gone before the public and stated there is evidence to impeach Mr. Trump for wrongdoing in the Ukraine debacle. They joined Messrs. Nadler and Schiff in misleading the people without producing evidence to support their claims. They should also be held accountable. Do the American people like paying salaries for the personal vendettas of elected members of Congress?\n\nI can\u2019t imagine the anguish that president and his family have had to endure at the hands of the Democrats. I doubt anyone in their right minds could withstand such personal assaults on a daily basis without becoming totally demoralized and bewildered.\n\nWhat the Democrats have done to this country with the help of the biased news media is unconscionable. They all should be held accountable and removed from their positions in disgrace.\n\nGREGORY J.
