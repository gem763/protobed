He open-air swims whatever the weather and makes people who try to patronise him call him Jeff. He\u2019s brave and persistent and funny. He dances in his pants, sings like a sea lion and believes he can play the piano. He loves dogs, pizza and his friends Amira, Abi and Zach. He worships Chelsea FC and has four other teams as back up. He loves us and we love him. We\u2019re not alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne study of 2000 families, by Dr Brian Stotko, found that 99 percent of people with Down\u2019s syndrome are happy with their lives and 97 percent of family members love their DS relative. That\u2019s unusually high, right? Another study of over 3000 parents from more than 50 countries showed that while 25 per cent saw Down\u2019s syndrome as a tragedy on being given a positive test result, given time only 0.68 percent felt the same way.\n\nSomeone told me early on \u2018the disability club is one that nobody wants to join, but once you do you realise all the best people in the world are in it with you\u2019. Parents of kids with Down\u2019s syndrome call themselves \u2018the lucky few\u2019. There\u2019s a great community, people have even got matching tattoos.\n\nPlease help us get the message out there that life with Down\u2019s syndrome is just different, not worse (Picture: Sally Phillips)\n\nI\u2019m nervous the high court case this week will mean medics revert to repeatedly offering terminations on diagnosis of Down\u2019s syndrome, even when mothers have clearly refused, and inadvertently put pressure on them to terminate. Hard to carry a baby you don\u2019t want, worse to be strong-armed into to terminating.\n\nI\u2019ve spoken to women traumatised by being asked at every appointment, \u2018are you sure?\u2019. Women who have to justify how they would \u2018cope\u2019 with a baby with a learning disability. Women who have been told, during labour, \u2018it\u2019s not too late to terminate\u2019. Pregnant women left with PTSD after surgical termination was described to them in detail, even though they had been clear they wanted their baby.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWomen shouldn\u2019t be offered a termination along with a positive test result for Down\u2019s syndrome. I\u2019m not sure there should even be a test. The world has moved on.\n\nMedical advances mean that life span is significantly increased. Social advances mean that civil society stands up against discrimination. We promote diversity in our schools and workplaces and yet, this outdated presumption of unbearable suffering, where it would be better for all involved if the baby didn\u2019t live, persists.\n\n99 percent of people with Down\u2019s syndrome are happy with their lives and 97 percent of family members love their DS relative (Picture: Sally Phillips)\n\n\u2018Wrongful birth payouts suggest that being born disabled is inherently wrong or unacceptable, which in a social climate that claims to be all embracing I struggle to reconcile,\u2019 says Adam Pearson, writer and presenter of Eugenics: Science\u2019s Greatest Scandal. \u2018If you were to replace Down syndrome with LGTBQ+ or race the discrimination is easy to spot.\u2019\n\nColette Lloyd of the Down\u2019s Syndrome Oxford makes the same point about gender. \u2018The judge was quick to say that this case did not reflect on the value of lives of people with Down\u2019s syndrome, although of course it does. Imagine bringing a wrongful birth case because you\u2019d had a girl.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Down\u2019s syndrome community is working hard for a culture shift, to get NHS trusts to introduce a support pathway for women who wish to continue their pregnancies. Come visit us in Down\u2019s syndrome land if you haven\u2019t (music and moonlight and love and romance) and please help us get the message out there that life with Down\u2019s syndrome is just different, not worse.\n\nAsk my friend Heidi, who is planning a spectacular wedding to the love of her life next year \u2013 both bride and bridegroom, have Down\u2019s syndrome. Not that different to many other 20-somethings, with no suffering individuals in sight.\n\nFor more stories of life with Down\u2019s syndrome see www.positiveaboutdownsyndrome.co.uk.\n\nMORE: Woman becomes country\u2019s first nursery school teacher with Downs syndrome\n\nMORE: World\u2019s longest Down\u2019s syndrome marriage stronger than ever after 27 years", "description": "Actor Sally Phillips writes on why being a parent of child with Down's syndrome is a privilege.", "authors": ["Sally Phillips", "Actor"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_3577-08e0_1570796032.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
