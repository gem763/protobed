There is also that of the presumption of innocence,\" she told MEPs.\n\nMore than her skills, it is her integrity that is in question here: MEPs criticize her for being investigated by the French authorities and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) for the case of fictitious jobs linked to MEP assistants.
