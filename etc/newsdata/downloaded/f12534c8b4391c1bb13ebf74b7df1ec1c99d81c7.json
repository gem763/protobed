working, travel in and out of the airport,\" he said.\n\n\"Yeah, have a voice, but not disrupt people's lives like this.\"\n\nA spokesman for London City Airport said: \"We continue to work closely with the Metropolitan Police to ensure the safe operation of the airport, which remains fully open and operational.\"\n\nThe airport advised passengers to check the status of their flight before travelling.", "description": "Extinction Rebellion activists say they want to \"shut down\" London City Airport for three days.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07qpcpk.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
