We got engaged at Easter and have set a wedding date for next summer, and we\u2019re in the process of buying our first home together.\n\nI am happy \u2013 things are easy with us and we\u2019re great mates \u2013 but I just have this niggling feeling that \u00adsomething is missing from our \u00adrelationship. There\u2019s a lack of passion and romance and, although I know this dwindles a bit in any long-term relationship, I\u2019m still missing it.\n\nTo complicate things, I\u2019ve become friendly with another guy who\u2019s one of my clients in the business I run. Absolutely nothing has happened between us as he\u2019s in a relationship. However, it has made me think about whether I\u2019m really happy with my fiance \u2013 surely if I felt totally sure about this marriage, I wouldn\u2019t even look at another man?\n\nI feel confused and uncertain about what to do or if I\u2019m just getting nervous because the wedding \u00adarrangements are starting to gather pace. Am I making problems where they don\u2019t exist? I\u2019d love your opinion.\n\nColeen says\n\nI think you have to listen to how you feel. Marriage is a big step and you should feel good about it when you walk down that aisle and not have these niggling doubts at the back of your mind. It\u2019s good to ask the \u00adquestions now because it\u2019ll be a lot easier to walk away from things now than after you\u2019re married.\n\nReally, the only way of working this out is to talk to your fiance, tell him what you\u2019re worried about and ask him how he\u2019s feeling.\n\nRemember, you\u2019ve got the added pressure of buying a home and perhaps it just feels a bit overwhelming and you need to slow things down.\n\nWould it be so bad if you pushed the wedding back a bit to give you time to work through these doubts and sort out the property side of things first?\n\nAs for this other man, I think he\u2019s just a welcome distraction when you\u2019re feeling a bit vulnerable and unsure of your relationship. But be careful not to confuse this with something real \u2013 you don\u2019t know what it would be like to have a relationship with him. And he\u2019s with someone else, too.\n\nYou\u2019re right, that intense passion you feel for someone at the start of a relationship does calm down, but in a good relationship other things develop alongside the physical attraction \u2013 love, friendship and loyalty, which are what ensure longevity.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason why things can\u2019t become more passionate or romantic, but it requires a bit of effort from both of you. Try it, then see where you are.", "description": "To complicate things, I\u2019ve become friendly with another guy who\u2019s one of my clients in the business I run", "authors": ["Coleen Nolan", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20706478.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_I191022_123635_162651oTextTRMRMMGLPICT000152881044o.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
