(J. Lawler Duggan/For The Washington Post)\n\nGavin Benke is a historian and lecturer at Boston University and is author of \" Risk and Ruin: Enron and the Culture of American Capitalism .\"\n\nLast month, in a stunning about face, the Business Roundtable swept aside decades of advocacy for \u201cshareholder primacy\u201d \u2014 the notion that the interests of stockholders must be placed above all other considerations. The organization, whose members are all CEOs of major U.S. companies, now believes that corporations must serve the interests of a broader set of stakeholders, including consumers, employees and the communities in which they operate.\n\nFor some, this move signals the end of the shareholder era ushered in by the economist Milton Friedman in 1970. That year, Friedman authored a now-infamous op-ed in the New York Times arguing that corporations needed to be singularly focused on the interests of their shareholders. Attending to the claims of other stakeholders (like workers, consumers and communities) could only lead to trouble.\n\nWhile it wasn't the only vision for the corporation circulating in business circles in the early 1970s, over the ensuing decades, this idea dominated business thinking and provided executives with a reason to dismiss criticism and accusations of misconduct. But the Business Roundtable reversal indicates that there is an opportunity for activists to force a reimagining of the corporation, one that can make these powerful institutions more accountable to the public.\n\nFriedman's op-ed came at a moment of intense social conflict in the United States. And the economist had little patience for those who wanted businesses to address the concerns of consumer movements, environmentalists and minority groups seeking more equal treatment in society. In just one example: mere months after the first Earth Day, Friedman listed \u201cavoiding pollution\u201d as one of the demands that corporations should ignore. Addressing such concerns would interfere with the market\u2019s ability to \u201cdetermine the allocation of scarce resources.\u201d\n\nFriedman\u2019s voice was loud, but while his view would become central to business practices in the following decades, at the time he did not speak for all in the business community. In fact, a group of executives, politicians and business school professors were thinking in very different terms.\n\nIn 1972, the Nixon administration organized and hosted a conference titled \u201cThe Industrial World Ahead: Business Looks at 1990.\u201d The world was undergoing such an intense period of social and economic change, some in the administration believed, that American corporations needed to start thinking more broadly about the future. When the conference opened on February 7, speaker after speaker insisted that the 1500 conference attendees were witnessing a major economic transformation. National economies were merging, and the lines between business and government had blurred.\n\nFriedman himself was absent, but his op-ed loomed over the proceedings.\n\nIn fact, several speakers pointedly denounced it. Arjay Miller, Dean of Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, felt like Friedman was simply putting a modern twist on Adam Smith\u2019s famous \u201cinvisible hand\u201d theory. But while that principle had \u201cworked remarkably well\u201d for \u201cnearly 200 years,\u201d it was a poor fit for the rapid social change facing the world in the early 1970s. It was, a \u201cnew ballgame,\u201d Miller told the audience. \u201cLife would be so much simpler,\u201d he commented, if Friedman had been right. But instead society was placing \u201ctremendous new demands\u201d on corporations.\n\nMany speakers at the conference believed that through the pursuit of profit, corporations had satisfied Americans\u2019 material wants. Rather than demanding new goods, the public was now turning its attention to \"quality of life\u201d issues, such as a clean environment. To retain both customers and workers, businesses needed to directly address these concerns.\n\nMiller was not alone in singling out Friedman for criticism. The consultant and writer Hazel Henderson characterized Friedman\u2019s argument as a \u201cfallacy.\u201d Because businesses \u201cregularly made ipso facto social decisions of enormous consequence,\u201d focusing only on the price of the stock was both shortsighted and dangerous.\n\nIn contrast to Friedman\u2019s vision, a number of speakers laid out a much wider role for the corporation. Willis Harman of the Stanford Research Institute, for example, began his talk by bluntly stating \u201cwhat is seemingly good business policy frequently turns out to be poor social policy.\u201d Harman was convinced that the world needed a \u201chumanistic capitalism\u201d that looked beyond profits to usher in a peaceful and spiritually fulfilling future instead. Others voiced similar ideas.\n\nThough the published conference proceedings reported that workshop sessions devoted to social responsibility turned into debates over \u201cthe question of stockholder versus public interest,\u201d it was clear that considering aims beyond shareholder returns was far from a radical idea.\n\nNor did these ideas die when the conference wrapped up. The reliably conservative U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Council on Trends and Perspectives continued to promote this view of the corporation. In \u201cThe Corporation in Transition \u2014 Redefining Its Social Charter,\u201d one of several short booklets the group published during the 1970s, the Chamber\u2019s Chief Economist Carl Madden directly appealed to corporate managers. \u201cSociety expects much from you,\u201d he wrote, and unless corporations started attending to public concerns businesses would face more regulations and restrictions. (Even shareholders themselves, the Council speculated, might start making such \u201cquality of life\u201d demands). Change seemed to be on the horizon.\n\nBut of course, this is not how things played out.\n\nWith American prosperity and corporate dominance waning, incoming Commerce Secretary, Pete Peterson, warned that American businesses \u201chad been lulled\u201d by decades of success. Inflation was already a growing problem for consumers. U.S. businesses were losing ground to foreign competition. As economic conditions soured during the 1970s, and government seemed powerless to stem the new phenomenon of \u201cstagflation,\u201d a toxic mix of a stagnant economy and inflation, politicians and economists turned toward \u201cthe market\u201d for solutions.\n\nWhen the doldrums of the 1970s abated, the economy of the 1980s seemed very different. A dynamic and booming stock market had replaced American industrial might. Friedman\u2019s focus on shareholders was well-suited to this new era marked by cutthroat competition and an obsessive focus on the market.\n\nEven if some continued to insist on a transformative vision of the corporation that would respond to social needs, such voices were drowned out as a new economic narrative about deregulation, entrepreneurialism and Wall Street as the keys to a thriving economy took hold.\n\nIn the 1980s, corporate raiders such as Michael Milken and T. Boone Pickens insisted they were making businesses stronger by forcing them to focus on the stock price. During the 1990s, CEOs continued to take their cues from the stock market. Keeping share prices high crowded out all other considerations, encouraging a short-term approach to strategy. At its worst, \u201cshareholder primacy\u201d led to fraud, such as when Enron wowed investors and shareholders through inflated profits in the 1990s before finally collapsing.\n\nFollowing the Great Recession and a vastly unequal recovery, however, public frustration with growing inequality and corporate unaccountability has created a new opening to rethink the role of the corporation in American society.\n\nThe Business Roundtable\u2019s statement is the product of a year-long process of surveying corporate executives, politicians, academics and others that revealed the corporation\u2019s social legitimacy is on shaky ground. Belatedly, corporate leaders are warming to a more expansive view of a corporation\u2019s obligations in an effort to regain credibility with more politically engaged consumers and employees.\n\nBut as the case of the 1970s demonstrates, this new disposition can fade quickly. Inevitably, some will call for the restoration of \u201cshareholder primacy.\u201d Because of its clarity and simplicity, Friedman\u2019s argument has an obvious appeal for executives. The notion that corporations are part of a broader social fabric means that executive decision-making would be a far messier process \u2014 and one that would risk addressing issues that don\u2019t always result in boosting a company\u2019s stock price.\n\nStill, this is a moment to be seized. Activists should invoke the Business Roundtable\u2019s statement whenever corporate leaders begin to privilege the market to the detriment of other considerations. It will take a sustained effort to push executives who signed the statement beyond mere rhetoric, and toward meaningful action. But such efforts are worth it because corporations are powerful actors that can, when pushed, benefit a public that is wider than those who own the company\u2019s stock.", "description": "A reversal by the Business Roundtable signals that now is the moment to rethink how corporations interact with employees, consumers, communities and the environment.", "authors": ["Gavin Benke", "Gavin Benke Is A Historian", "Lecturer At Boston University", "Is Author Of", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Ub8Lzn59B14ZCogldSI_8l1cbek=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6TUYQXC324I6TGGUQRAIRUJV6I.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
