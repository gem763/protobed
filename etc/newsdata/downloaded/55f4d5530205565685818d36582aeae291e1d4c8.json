(AP) - Melania Trump said Monday that companies \u201cmust stop\u201d marketing e-cigarettes to children, saying they are addictive and dangerous.\n\nMarketing tobacco products to kids is already prohibited in the United States, and Juul Labs Inc., the nation\u2019s largest maker of electronic cigarettes, has said it will cease advertising them in the U.S.\n\nStill, some believe Juul\u2019s early online marketing of e-cigarettes contributed to an explosion in vaping among youth.\n\nMrs. Trump said \u201cit is important to me that we all work to educate children and families about the dangers associated with this habit.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarketing this addictive product to children must stop.\u201d\n\nThe first lady promotes an anti-drug message through the \u201cBe Best\u201d youth initiative she launched in May 2018.\n\nShe and the president have a 13-year-old son, Barron.\n\nLast month, Mrs. Trump tweeted her concerns over the \u201cgrowing epidemic of e-cigarette use in our children.\u201d\n\nShe later joined President Donald Trump when he announced from the Oval Office that U.S. health authorities will act to ban thousands of fruity and other flavorings used in e-cigarettes.\n\nFederal statistics show vaping among teens had increased significantly between 2017 and 2018.\n\nAmong high school students, e-cigarette use increased 78% - from 11.7% t0 20.8% - during the period, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s National Youth Tobacco Survey.\n\nE-cigarette use among middle school students also increased.\n\nMrs. Trump said her visits to hospitals and rehabilitation centers have allowed her to see \u201cthe horrible results of drug abuse.\u201d\n\nShe pledged to \u201ccontinue to address addiction as long as it affects our children, our youth and our schools.\u201d\n\nThe first lady spoke at a rally at the headquarters of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration near Washington to mark the start of the annual \u201cRed Ribbon Week\u201d on Oct. 23.\n\nActor Dean Norris, who played DEA Special Agent Hank Schrader on the AMC series, \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d was master of ceremonies.\n\n\u201cRed Ribbon Week\u201d came into being after the 1985 torture and slaying of DEA Special Agent Enrique \u201cKiki\u201d Camarena in Mexico.\n\nAmericans began wearing red ribbons to honor Camarena\u2019s sacrifice, and schools in the region of California where he lived formed clubs in his name and pledged to live drug-free lives.\n\nThe week was formalized in 1988.\n\nCamarena\u2019s widow, Mika, attended the rally. Students seated in the auditorium rose and took a pledge to stay away from drugs.\n\nMost of those in the audience wore the event\u2019s \u201cred ribbon\u201d pin. The first lady did not wear one on her sleeveless black dress.\n\nHer office said she was not given a pin by DEA staff before entering the auditorium with acting administrator Uttam Dhillon.\n\n___\n\nFollow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Melania Trump said Monday that companies \"must stop\" marketing e-cigarettes to children, saying they are addictive and dangerous.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Darlene Superville"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/07/melania_trump_58441_c0-224-5362-3350_s1770x1032.jpg?ccb550efa52b82c5d1c4031536c37920c7bc5ad0", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
