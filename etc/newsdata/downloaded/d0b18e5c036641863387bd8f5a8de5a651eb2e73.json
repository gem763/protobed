(AP) - Disgruntled receiver Antonio Brown has asked the Oakland Raiders to release him a day after he was fined for an outburst at practice toward general manager Mike Mayock.\n\nBrown put a post on his Instagram account Saturday morning saying he\u2019s not \u201cmad\u201d but wants the \u201cfreedom to prove\u201d his skeptics wrong. The post ends with his request to be released.\n\nA person familiar with the situation said Brown had been fined by the team Friday for the confrontation with Mayock in practice two days earlier. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the fine wasn\u2019t announced.\n\nESPN reported the fine was for $215,073 for conduct detrimental to the team. That could allow the Raiders to release Brown before the season opener without having to pay him more than $29 million in guarantees over the next two years.\n\nBrown later sent an email to ESPN saying: \u201cno way I play after they took that and made my contract week to week.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Disgruntled receiver Antonio Brown has asked the Oakland Raiders to release him a day after he was fined for an outburst at practice toward general manager Mike Mayock.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Josh Dubow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/05/raiders_brown_football_82609_c0-158-3785-2364_s1770x1032.jpg?92d57fa8808f7a00f21e878e10d84a9d9afa32c3", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
