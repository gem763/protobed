It didn\u2019t help that the company predicted revenues for the fourth quarter \u2014 including the all-important holiday season \u2014 also look soft.\n\nThe good news for Amazon amidst all the bad news was that revenue was actually up at the company. For the quarter Amazon raked in $70 billion, beating analysts\u2019 expectations of $68.8 billion.\n\nHowever, the company reported a profit of $2.1 billion, or $4.23 a share versus the $4.62 that analysts had projected. And even though sales were up this year, earnings per share were down from $5.75 in the year-ago period. As MarketWatch noted, it\u2019s the first time earnings at the company have shrunk since 2017.\n\nAnother potential warning sign for investors was the revenue from the company\u2019s web services business, which came in at $9 billion. Analysts had predicted roughly $9.2 billion from the business line. If competition starts eating into the services business (which still grew at a healthy 35% over the year-ago period), that could spell problems for the company\u2019s stock \u2014 which has used AWS revenues to buoy spending elsewhere.\n\nThe company has been spending heavily all year to offer new services. The expansion of its free one-day delivery program has cost Amazon more than $800 million in the second quarter.\n\nAmazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos defended the move to one-day shipping in a statement.\n\n\u201cCustomers love the transition of Prime from two days to one day \u2014 they\u2019ve already ordered billions of items with free one-day delivery this year. It\u2019s a big investment, and it\u2019s the right long-term decision for customers,\u201d Bezos said. \u201cAnd although it\u2019s counterintuitive, the fastest delivery speeds generate the least carbon emissions because these products ship from fulfillment centers very close to the customer \u2014 it simply becomes impractical to use air or long ground routes.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead to the holiday season Amazon predicted net sales of between $80 billion and $86.5 billion, with operating income between $1.2 billion and $2.9 billion, versus $3.8 billion from a year-ago period. Analysts were expecting to see revenue numbers more in the $87 billion range.", "description": "Amazon shares fell by nearly 7%, or $118.38, in after-hours trading on Thursday after the company reported its first earnings miss in two years.
