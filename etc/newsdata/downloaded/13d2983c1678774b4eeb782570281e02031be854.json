(Jason Arnold, Supplied)\n\nThis black mamba, rescued from the roof of a KwaZulu-Natal home, was most likely there to dine on some rats, before dashing back to the bush, snake catcher Jason Arnold from Universal Reptiles told News24.\n\nHe captured the incident, which happened toward the end of September, on camera.\n\n\"It was a fairly difficult rescue, due to the fact that the snake wasn't easily accessible,\" Arnold said.\n\nThe female mamba, between 2.35m and 2.4m long, was hiding in the ceiling cavity of the Verulam home.\n\nArnold initially tried removing some of the roof tiles, but when he couldn't find the snake he decided to break through the ceiling instead.\n\nHe said the mamba was in a really good condition.\n\n\"She wasn't underweight and didn't have any scars or marks on her body,\" he said.\n\nArnold told News24 that a family of rats had taken up residency in the roof and that the mamba most likely picked up on their scent, and followed them up to the roof.\n\n\"That was basically like a KFC or McDonalds for a mamba,\" he quipped.\n\n\"She probably found that every time she was hungry and needed a meal she would come and visit the local McDonalds inside that roof and eat a rat and then go again.\"\n\nHe released the mamba back into the wild.\n\n\"I try to take snakes to areas where I think they'll be happy, where they'll settle \u2026 and where that particular species naturally occurs,\" Arnold explained.\n\nHe warned that South Africans can still expect plenty of snake activity toward the end of the year as the majority of snakes only mate in spring.\n\nArnold advised people to save the contact numbers of snake catchers in their region.\n\n\"Try and get a few numbers if possible and try and keep those numbers very handy.\"\n\nAnd, when you do see a snake? He said people should try not to interfere, or try to be a hero.\n\n\"If you don't understand snakes, and you don't know what you are dealing with, the tables could turn and you could end up being on the receiving end of a bite,\" he said.", "description": "This black mamba, rescued from the roof of a KwaZulu-Natal home, was most likely there to dine on some rats, before dashing back to the bush, snake catcher Jason Arnold from Universal Reptiles told News24.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9444/48590b5add984ebd8d14feca376b4a76.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
