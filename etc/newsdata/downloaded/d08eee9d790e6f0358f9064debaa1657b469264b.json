Perhaps they were selected to offer a dissenting view on the issue. Along similar morally-perverse lines, the illegitimate, socialist, thuggish Maduro regime in Venezuela has been selected to join the UN's human rights council -- the body's darkly farcical panel, from which the Trump administration rightly withdrew last year. In a scathing statement released in response to this decision, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo teed off:\n\nIt is sadly no surprise that Maduro shamelessly sought a seat on the UN Human Rights Council in an effort to block any limit to his repressive control of the Venezuelan people. What is truly tragic, however, is that other nations voted to give Maduro\u2019s representative for Venezuela a seat on the UN Human Rights Council. This is a harsh blow not just against the victims of the Venezuelan regime, but also against the cause of human rights around the world. The Human Rights Council ought to be a protector and defender of human rights of people the world over. It should be speaking out about the daily abuses of the former Maduro regime, and others like it. Instead, the Council has become an exercise in shameless hypocrisy \u2013 with some of the world\u2019s most serious offenders sitting on the Council itself.\n\nThe list of the Maduro regime's abuses is long and ugly. Unfortunately, Venezuela's delegation will fit right in. This is not satire:\n\nU.N. Human Rights Council members today include:\n\n???? Saudi Arabia\n\n???? Pakistan\n\n???? Somalia\n\n???? Nigeria\n\n???? Qatar\n\n???? Egypt\n\n???? Cuba\n\n???? China\n\n\n\nJoining on January 1, 2020:\n\n???? Venezuela (Maduro regime)\n\n???? Mauritania\n\n???? Sudan\n\n???? Libya\n\n\n\nI wish I were making this up. I'm not. This is real. \u2014 Hillel Neuer (@HillelNeuer) October 23, 2019\n\n\n\nLook at that roster. Saudi \"Bone Saws\" Arabia, communist Cuba, and communist China -- home to systemic persecution of minorities and other horrors (don't tell LeBron et al). And coming soon, in addition to Venezuela, it's the government responsible for one of the world's most recent genocides, among other abusers. It'd all be breathtaking, if not for the pathetic reality that it's actually par for the course. The United States ambassador to Germany, Ric Grenell, also notes how many aggressively homophobic regimes are represented on a committee ostensibly devoted to protecting basic human rights:\n\nAnd these criminalize homosexuality - in direct violation of the UN\u2019s own Declaration of Human Rights:\n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia*\n\nPakistan*\n\nSomalia*\n\nNigeria*\n\nQatar\n\nEgypt (habitual debauchery, no outright ban)\n\nJoining soon:\n\nMauritania*\n\nSudan*\n\nLibya*\n\n* = death penalty https://t.co/I1bSwAexrG \u2014 Richard Grenell (@RichardGrenell) October 24, 2019\n\n\n\nGrenell, who is openly gay, is the point person for the Trump administration's global initiative on decriminalizing homosexuality. One wonders what the liberal bien pensants in the vaunted \"international community,\" who wax eloquent about \"multilateralism\" and \"global institutions\" -- while sneering at UN-skeptical Americans -- think of this insulting, farcical nonsense. Since I mentioned Iran and women's rights above, I'll leave you with this:\n\n1)\n\nIt\u2019s my honor that Chris Wallace recognized me as \u201cPower player of the week\u201d in Fox news Sunday program. The real power player are Iranian women who are fighting against religious dictatorship.\n\nWe are no going to give up our fight.#WhiteWednesdays pic.twitter.com/yHL9Prr8lF \u2014 Masih Alinejad ???
