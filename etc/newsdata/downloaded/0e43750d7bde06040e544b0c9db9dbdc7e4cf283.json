That\u2019s it. I was able to play with it. My bad not to win.\u201d\n\nThe third-seeded Swiss made 61 unforced errors to 40 winners but the miscues, including 33 off an uncharacteristically erratic forehand, only mounted as Dimitrov dragged him further into deep waters in the third and fourth sets over a series of gruelling baseline rallies.\n\n\u201cOne of the only things for me was try to keep him as much as possible on the court,\u201d Dimitrov said. \u201cI did that very well. A lot of long games. Yeah, clearly in the end he was not at his best. I used every opportunity I had.\u201d\n\nThe unseeded Bulgarian, who had been on the wrong end of all seven career meetings with Federer and lost 16 of the 18 sets played, then breezed to the finish line and into a third career major semi-final, where he will face No 5 seed Daniil Medvedev on Friday.\n\nFederer, who was the oldest player to reach the last eight at a major since a 39-year-old Jimmy Connors\u2019 semi-final run at the 1991 US Open, was off to the races after breaking in his first return game and taking the opening set in under a half hour, but Dimitrov was undeterred and drew first blood in the seventh game of the second on his way to leveling the match at a set apiece.\n\nEven as Federer broke twice in the third to comfortably stake a two-sets-to-one advantage, the errors started to pile up as the rallies began to lengthen on Dimitov\u2019s mandate. Try as he did to shorten the points with frequent net approaches \u2013 nearly three times as many (56) as Dimitrov (20) on the night \u2013 Federer\u2019s unraveling continued with one unforced error after another coming forward.\n\nThen came the taxing 55-minute fourth where Federer failed to convert all of his six break-point chances as he buckled under the constant pressure of Dimitrov\u2019s return game, including a feature-length 22-point hold while serving at 3-4 which appeared to exact a lasting cost.\n\n\u201cI was very happy even though I lost the game, I did exactly what I wanted to do,\u201d Dimitrov said. \u201cI think even when I lost that game, I was actually smiling going through the changeover because that game must have hurt him a lot. For me, it actually filled me up.\u201d\n\nAfter the 28-year-old held to force a decider, Federer disappeared from the court for nearly 10 minutes for medical treatment as his emboldened opponent began doing push-ups by his chair to prevent cramping.\n\nYet Federer\u2019s form only dipped upon his return as the fifth set rapidly got away from him as a hush enveloped the 23,771-seat stadium. When he finally sprayed a forehand wide on match point after three hours and 12 minutes, the 38-year-old was left to rue another failed bid for a sixth championship at Flushing Meadows, where he has now gone 11 years without a title after winning five straight from 2004 through 2008.\n\n\u201cJust low,\u201d said Federer, who fell to 43-2 in his career at majors against players outside the ATP\u2019s top 50, the first blemish coming last year against Australia\u2019s John Millman. \u201cJust disappointed it\u2019s over because I did feel like I was actually playing really well after a couple of rocky starts. It\u2019s just a missed opportunity to some extent that you\u2019re in the lead, you can get through, you have two days off after. It was looking good.\n\n\u201cBut got to take the losses. They\u2019re part of the game.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about his future major prospects, Federer said: \u201cI don\u2019t have the crystal ball. Do you? So we never know. I hope so, of course. I think still it\u2019s been a positive season. Disappointing now, but I\u2019ll get back up, I\u2019ll be all right.\u201d\n\nDimitrov, who climbed as high as No 3 in the rankings only two years ago, entered the season\u2019s final grand slam with 12 wins in 27 matches all year and losses in seven of his last eight, including one to the world No 405. He\u2019s now into the semi-finals of a major for the third time after previous runs at the 2014 French and 2017 Australian.\n\n\u201cDespite the fact that I was losing very tough matches, close matches against players that I shouldn\u2019t lose [to], yet I did, I kept on believing in the process, kept on working, kept on trying to improve whatever else I had to improve on my end,\u201d Dimitrov said. \u201cI really controlled the things that I could. I think that\u2019s as simple as that. Sometimes the most simple things are hardest.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt was not a pretty time. I\u2019m not going to lie. But for me also today, I don\u2019t want to sound too humble, but it was just another match for me really. I don\u2019t want to say I had nothing to lose, because I felt I did.\u201d", "description": "Grigor Dimitrov took advantage of an off-colour performance from Roger Federer to beat the Swiss for the first time in his career", "authors": ["Bryan Armen Graham"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73875b3a077a5579e0753b01990c36a957a9cf0a/0_182_5450_3271/master/5450.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dd454b69f8fc34bf704e19af0716d854"}
