They reportedly left a baby in their vehicle.\n\nStaff told local reporters they were able to lock the group out of the restaurant. No injuries were reported, and police are working on a description of the suspects, ABC13 reported.\n\nHouston Police confirmed to HuffPost that they received a call just before 9 p.m. regarding five or six people in a vehicle.
