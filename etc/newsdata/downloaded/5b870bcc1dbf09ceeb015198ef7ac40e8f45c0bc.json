Reuters reported last week that Nowak and Smith were on leave, and two former JPMorgan traders, John Edmonds and Christian Trunz, have pleaded guilty to federal charges.", "description": "The U.S. Department of Justice charged two current traders and one former metals trader for their alleged participation in a racketeering conspiracy over...", "authors": ["Steve Goldstein", "European Markets Editor"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
