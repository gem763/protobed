Over the weekend, authorities in Britain revealed that the woman, who has been identified as Anne Sacoolas, was no longer in the country. The news was met with swift backlash, especially since police say she told them she had no plans to leave during the investigation into the crash.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s broken our family,\u201d Dunn\u2019s mother, Charlotte Charles, said in an emotional TV interview this week.\n\nCalls to a number listed for Sacoolas in Virginia did not go through and were met with a constant busy signal.\n\nUnder international law, foreign diplomats and family members enjoy certain protections that allow them to avoid prosecution for almost any crime unless the diplomat\u2019s home country waives immunity, according to the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. While it\u2019s not clear whether the woman is fully entitled to these protections, Charles, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and local authorities have all urged U.S. President Donald Trump to intervene.\n\n\u201cThis is a tragedy of the largest proportion,\u201d Northamptonshire Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner Stephen Mold tells TIME. \u201cAt the end of the day, there is a special relationship between the U.K. and the U.S. We ask them to treat this as though it was the other way round.\u201d\n\nImmunity is considered a cornerstone of diplomacy and is intended to protect diplomats and their families in hostile environments or from harassment in host countries, according to Scott Anderson, an international law expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., who is also a former U.S. diplomat. Yet many in the general public have long seen the privileges as problematic, allowing diplomats to flout laws as minor as paying for parking tickets. In 1975, when a Barbados ambassador claimed his immunity extended to his dog, which had bitten multiple people in New York, the case was seen as a questionable abuse of the protections.\n\nThis week, a new poll found that 84% of Britons and 63% of Americans agree that diplomatic immunity should not be invoked in the case of Dunn\u2019s death. But the process of waiving immunity for diplomats is not simple. In a statement, the State Department said immunity waiver cases are \u201cconsidered carefully given the global impact such decisions carry\u201d but that \u201cimmunity is rarely waived.\u201d\n\nLast year, the U.S. refused to waive immunity for its diplomat, Col. Joseph Hall, when he was accused in Pakistan of killing a motorcyclist after running a red light. Hall left Pakistan, which drew much ire from Pakistani officials who wanted the U.S. to revoke his immunity so he could be criminally charged.\n\nOnly the most egregious criminal cases involving malicious conduct seem to have resulted in revocations, Anderson says. In 1997, when Gueorgui Makharadze, a diplomat from the country of Georgia, caused a crash that killed a 16-year-old girl and injured four other people while he was driving drunk in Washington, D.C., Georgian leaders initially claimed immunity for Makharadze, who was the second-highest-ranking diplomat in the embassy at the time. However, they later waived his immunity, at the request of the United States, and allowed the U.S. to prosecute Makharadze. He pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and aggravated assault and was sentenced to seven to 21 years in prison. Makharadze served some of that time in the U.S. before being returned to Georgia, where he served most of the sentence.", "description": "An international law that largely shields foreign diplomats and their family members from criminal prosecution has come under scrutiny after the wife of an American\u2026", "authors": ["Melissa Chan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/T7hcM7Kt9DJEZzhOLoUHTA--~B/aD03OTk7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/3cb5c393a0d29cd8d37c9b3def2d0351", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
