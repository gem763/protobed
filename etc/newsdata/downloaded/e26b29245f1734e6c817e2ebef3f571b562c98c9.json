Your staff have just given stickers to every child on the flight to Antalya. Every boy got given a \u2018future Tui pilot\u2019 sticker and every girl a \u2018future Tui cabin crew\u2019 sticker. This is an absolute shocker and you should be ashamed #equalopportunities \u2014 SALMarkMunro (@SALMarkMunro) October 10, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Munro was travelling as part of a group of 20, including 11 children.\n\nHe said all six boys in the group were handed pilot stickers while the five girls were given a cabin crew as they disembarked.\n\nWhen two children swapped, they were told by a member of the cabin crew they now had the wrong ones and had to change, he added.\n\nMr Munro is the Chief Executive of Scottish Athletics and said his work prided themselves on equal opportunities.\n\nHe added: \u2018Everything we do is to show that everyone is equal and can reach whatever level they want.\n\n\u2018People might say they are just stickers but it is the message that goes along with that.\u2019\n\nThe incident happened on board a flight from Newcastle to Turkey\n\nThe gaffe by TUI comes a year after the firm was forced to make an apology after the same stickers were handed out based on outdated gender stereotypes.\n\nThey claimed it was a \u2018simple mix-up\u2019 when staff on board a flight from Bristol to Cyprus issued the badges last August.\n\nSocial media users backed Mr Munro, with one saying: \u2018Depressing that in 2019 sex stereotypes are still so entrenched and being passed on to the next generation.\u2019\n\nAnother quipped: \u2018TUI, the 1950s just called. They want their stickers back.\u2019\n\nMany airlines have been trying to step up the number of female pilots they employ.\n\nIn the UK, about 4.77% of airline pilots are female, which is down on the global average of 5.18% according to the Air Line Pilots Association International Trade Union.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBritish Airways has the highest percentage of female pilots for UK firms at just under 6% with TUI not far behind.\n\nA spokesperson for TUI UK issued an apology, saying: \u2018We work hard to be a diverse and inclusive business and would like to apologise to any customer upset at the sticker their child received on their recent flight to Turkey.\n\n\u2018Both future pilot and future cabin crew stickers are in our TUI blue colours and are not designed for boys or girls but for all children.\n\n\u2018We use the stickers as a way for our crew onboard to create special moments for our customers and the feedback continues to be positive.\n\n\u2018We realise on this occasion some customers are disappointed by this and we will be working with our crew to ensure children have a choice of which sticker they receive.\u2019", "description": "Tui UK handed out the stickers to boys and girls on a flight from Newcastle to Turkey.", "authors": ["Jane Wharton"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_89433301_1570801338.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
