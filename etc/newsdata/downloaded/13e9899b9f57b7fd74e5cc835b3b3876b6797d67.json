He took home memos detailing private meetings he had with the president and then disclosed their contents to a friend who he believed would leak them to The New York Times. His motivation was to make sure a special counsel would be appointed to investigate alleged \u201ccollusion\u201d between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\nThe Justice Department decided not to prosecute Mr. Comey, citing a lack of evidence that he \u201cknew and intended to violate laws on handling classified information.\u201d As FBI director, how could he not know of these things? Of course he had to know. If you think this mirrors Mr. Comey\u2019s explanation of why Hillary Clinton would not be held legally accountable for her mishandling of classified information, you would be right. At the time, Mr. Comey said Hillary Clinton did not \u201cintend to break the law.\u201d\n\nIs this the new standard? If it is, the prisons should be emptied because I\u2019m sure every inmate would then claim he or she didn\u2019t intend to break the law and therefore should be released.\n\nThe inspector general noted: \u201cBy not safeguarding sensitive information obtained during the course of his FBI employment, and by using it to create public pressure for official action, Comey set a dangerous example for the over 35,000 current FBI employee, and the many thousands more former FBI employees, who similarly have access to or knowledge of non-public information.\u201d\n\nTaking to Twitter, Mr. Comey claimed the IG report vindicates him. That dissembling is reminiscent of some of Bill Clinton\u2019s lies and Hillary\u2019s, too.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, Ohio Republican, the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee issued a statement: \u201c(Comey\u2019s) actions were disgraceful and part of a wider effort within the Obama Justice Department to undermine President Trump.\u201d Who can credibly deny that, though many partisans will.\n\nThis isn\u2019t over, and Mr. Comey\u2019s actions may yet be used as part of Inspector General Michael Horowitz\u2019s continuing investigation (expected to be concluded sometime this month) into whether false information was used to secure a FISA surveillance warrant on Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser.\n\nAs The Washington Post reported, \u201cThat surveillance was based on the FBI\u2019s suspicions that Page could be an agent of the Russian government. Page, who was never charged with a crime, has denied the accusation and accused the FBI of politically motivated surveillance that violated his civil liberties.\u201d\n\nThe motivations behind Mr. Comey\u2019s actions and those in the media who fanned the flames of collusion are now being revealed and should not come as a surprise. If the FISA warrant is shown to have been based on wrong information and the federal judge who issued it is shown to have been lied to, will the liars be prosecuted? They should be, but in the Comey-Clinton \u201cno intention of breaking the law\u201d era, I\u2019m not betting on it.\n\n\u2022 Cal Thomas is a nationally syndicated columnist.
