(AP) - It happened in an instant.\n\nWarning sounds alerted the team of student nurses at Bryan College of Health Sciences of plummeting oxygen levels.\n\nTheir patient was crashing, yet the aspiring health professionals froze.\n\n\u201cWe just kind of stood there: \u2018What do we do?\u2019\u201d said Trinidie Christensen, a third-year nursing student from Denver.\n\nAbout 30 seconds \u2014 the blink of an eye for most, but an eternity with a life on the line \u2014 went by before the shock subsided, added Brielle Weverka of Arapahoe, who is also a third-year student at Bryan\u2019s nursing college.\n\nThen, the classroom lectures and studies and training kicked in.\n\nThe care team propped the patient up to better open up her airway and replaced the nasal tube with a mask to create a steadier flow of oxygen, before calling the rapid response team that would stand by in case the situation worsened, Weverka explained.\n\nThe experience was harrowing, but also entirely made up.\n\nInstead of a real person, the patient was a manikin capable of breathing, blinking and crying. And instead of a hospital room, the whole scene took place in a state-of-the-art learning lab in Bryan\u2019s new simulation center.\n\nWeverka, who is part of the Nursing Care II class, told the Lincoln Journal Star the simulation reminded the students to be nimble and assertive, as well as to rely on their training when the unexpected happens.\n\n\u201cI think our teacher was just waiting for us to get to that \u2018aha!\u2019 moment,\u201d Weverka said, \u201cwhich was super nice.\u201d\n\nBryan College of Health Sciences, which is enrolling a record 775 students this year, has been using simulation as a teaching technique for nurses and other health care professionals since 2003.\n\nThe simulation center, and its high-tech teaching labs and classroom spaces, reopened at Bryan East Campus earlier this year in a renovated dormitory.\n\nBarbara Sittner, director of the center, said the days of learning to give an insulin shot by injecting an orange or administering an IV with a teacher helping guide the needle into a vein are gone.\n\nNow, students perfect skills like assessing patients after admission to labor and delivery to hooking up a ventilator in an intensive care unit in a controlled environment long before they step foot on a hospital floor.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really have it quantified yet how many times it takes for someone to feel proficient,\u201d Sittner said, \u201cbut we\u2019ve seen the difference in doing simulation.\u201d\n\nThis week\u2019s simulation, run by instructor Jenna Dubas, centers on caring for a cancer patient who has vomited \u2014 a recipe Sittner concocted of \u201cvomit powder, oatmeal and a little tea\u201d \u2014 and is complaining of nausea.\n\nEach of the six students in the class are in the room working together as a team. There\u2019s a primary care nurse, a nurse responsible for medicine safety and an evidence-based practice expert, to name a few.\n\nDubas monitors the students from a control room, recording their progress on camera while also playing the role of the patient. When the student nurses ask the patient a question as part of their assessment, Dubas responds into a microphone that transmits her voice from the manikin\u2019s mouth.\n\nIf something goes wrong, and it inevitably does as the students put their classroom knowledge to practical use for the first time, Dubas can adjust the manikin\u2019s breathing and heart rate, or give voice to pain or discomfort.\n\n\u201cThey do a good job of making it real,\u201d said Christensen, who wants to return to work in Denver after graduating.\n\nThe goal of the simulation in the Nursing Care II class is to give the students an idea of the scope of a working RN through simulation, teaching them to troubleshoot situations and rely on their instincts, Dubas said.\n\n\u201cI always tell them, there\u2019s a box we\u2019ve made that we\u2019ll let you ping pong around in, but we won\u2019t let you get too far off course,\u201d Dubas said. \u201cIf they do, we try to stay in character and queue them to do something different.\u201d\n\nWeverka and Christensen said their experiences in the simulation center have given them room to practice the skills they\u2019ll need to be successful in the nursing field, where a 34% shortage is projected in Nebraska by 2025.\n\nSittner said working nurses, physicians and other health care professionals \u2014 400 in all \u2014 have refined their skills using simulation since the center opened in August.\n\n\u201cThe more that people use it, the more they want to use it as a teaching modality,\u201d Sittner said. \u201cIt\u2019s all focused on quality and safety, and it\u2019s the best thing for our nursing students to practice different skills.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It happened in an instant.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Chris Dunker"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/05/exchange_nursing_students_56823_c0-58-2000-1224_s1770x1032.jpg?c328e467abaf21cbe0bf31b267f859652664401b", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
