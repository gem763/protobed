We have previously received support from numerous anime series in promoting blood drives, and these partnerships have been well-received and increased the amount of blood that was donated. In regards to opinions about the current promotion, we are listening to them sincerely, and will take them into consideration for future activities.\u201d\n\nSo it doesn\u2019t look like the Japanese Red Cross Society is going to cancel the partnership or stop offering donors the clear files, which will be available until the end of the month. It also sounds like the second Uzaki-chan blood drive partnership, which kicks off in February, is still on the schedule.\n\nSource: J Cast News via Livedoor News via Otakomu\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Heading to Comiket this year?
