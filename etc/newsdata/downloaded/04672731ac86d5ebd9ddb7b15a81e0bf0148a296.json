Yes, was the judge's answer to the key question at the heart of this emotive test case.\n\nThere was a small round of applause as the verdict was read out in front of a crowded courtroom. Euthanasia is supposed to empower the patient, offering them the chance to decide when they want to die. Even in a country where it's been legal for almost two decades, the practice remains controversial.\n\nIn this case, the judges ruled that by the time the patient died it would have been impossible to establish what she wanted, such was the severity of her dementia that she no longer understood what the word \"euthanasia\" even meant.\n\nThis trial forced doctors and lawyers to confront a practical and moral dilemma; at what point do you stop checking if someone wants to live or die, and should they still have the power to decide if they're not fully in control of their mental capacities?\n\nWhat happened to the patient?\n\nAfter being diagnosed with Alzheimer's four years before she died, the patient wrote a statement saying that she wanted to be euthanised before entering a care home - but that she wanted to decide when the time was right.\n\nBefore she was taken into care, a doctor decided that assisted suicide should be administered based on her prior statement. This was confirmed by two separate doctors independently and a date was set.\n\nWhen the day came to end the woman's life, a sedative was put in her coffee and she lost consciousness.\n\nBut the woman then woke up and had to be held down by her daughter and husband while the process was finished.\n\nWhy did the case end up in court?\n\nAt the centre of the case was the question of the woman's ability to consent to ending her life despite her previous statement.\n\n\"A crucial question to this case is how long a doctor should continue consulting a patient with dementia, if the patient in an earlier stage already requested euthanasia,\" prosecution service spokeswoman Sanna van der Harg said.\n\n\"We do not doubt the doctor's honest intentions,\" she said.\n\n\"A more intensive discussion with the patient\" could have taken place before the decision to end her life, she added.\n\nHowever, the daughter of the deceased woman thanked the doctor.\n\n\"The doctor freed my mother from the mental prison which she ended up in,\" she said in a statement.", "description": "Prosecutors argued that a dementia patient euthanised in 2016 had not been asked to verify her wish.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/DA42/production/_108747855_gettyimages-925844748.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
