The idea is not just to drum up repeat business but get people to buy both products together.\n\n\"That's really helped us think more about the macro,\" Del Pozzo said. \"Think about what we can do together now \u2014 the ability to leverage digital to drive that snack and beverage occasion as one company has really been a huge benefit.\"\n\nFrito-Lay has also created e-commerce snack packages for people to send to loved ones in the military or college. Boxed CEO Chiegh Huang talked about how the wholesale retailer tested e-commerce packs from Pepsico's Quaker Oats on its platform.\n\nRead More: Amazon competitor Boxed's CEO Chieh Huang takes a thinly veiled swipe at Amazon and reveals how the wholesale retailer is cozying up to CPG giants like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo\n\nThe company is also pushing people to subscribe to products they buy repeatedly, like Gatorade in the case of parents with student athletes.\n\n\"Leveraging subscription to drive impulse is a huge opportunity for us,\" Del Pozzo said.\n\nTaking advantage of impulse buys has become a bigger priority for the company overall. The company ran ads for Tostito's that popped up on people's browsers when they searched for guacamole ingredients, for example.\n\nFrito-Lay has also become better at using data to target people. Instead of blanketing a geographical area with a single flavor profile, it's personalizing its product selection based on store, ZIP code, and household data.\n\n\"We think personalization in general is really where folks can differentiate,\" he said. \"So we're using data to help inform the right product on the right shelf. The reality is that Walgreens in Atlanta may be serving a number of different consumers.\"", "description": "Frito-Lay is adjusting its packaging and making healthier products, said Mike Del Pozzo, SVP of sales and chief customer officer.", "authors": ["Tanya Dua"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d88e0be2e22af191b7acee2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
