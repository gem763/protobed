It could have announced that the nation has banned the death sentence; it could have said it\u2019s not a crime to be homosexual; or it could have just told someone else to host it because it\u2019s a sorry farce the tournament is being held there in the first place. But instead, Qatar did what The Fiver often does when it wants people to like us \u2013 it announced that booze will be freely available!\n\n\u201cAlcohol is not part of our culture. However, hospitality is,\u201d cheered Qatar\u2019s official Fun Tsar, Nasser al-Khater. \u201cAlcohol is not as readily available here as in other parts of the world but for the World Cup we want to ensure it is accessible for fans who want to have a drink.\u201d With England having a half-decent side these days and likely to qualify, Doha cafe owners might want to ready themselves for a winter influx of thirsty red-faced folk, including $exually Repressed Morris Dancing Fiver and That Effing Brass Band.\n\nAlcohol set to be subsidised and more available at 2022 World Cup in Qatar Read more\n\nThough whether they will ever get close to drinking enough Tin to get moody is debatable. The price of raising your blood pressure with the frothy stuff in Qatar is an eye-popping \u00a310 a pint. Ordinarily, The Fiver\u2019s advice would be to find an old piece of hosepipe and mainline some petrol from the nearest taxi to lift your spirits, but the word is that Qatar will look to relax the sin tax on alcohol in order to reduce prices to something similar to having a tipple in a trendy London boozer.\n\nSo, that\u2019s one potential hurdle cleared for sinful, repressed football-following folk looking to have a good time. The other is whether their behaviour once they\u2019ve refreshed themselves is acceptable: public drunkenness is a crime that can be punishable by flogging. To be fair to Khater, he did say that security staff would be trained to accept behaviour they wouldn\u2019t normally put up with, though given that he added that public shows of affection from anyone are \u201cfrowned upon\u201d in Qatar, we\u2019re guessing the tolerance threshold won\u2019t be particularly high. \u201cAs long as people are happy, that\u2019s fine,\u201d honked Dr Fun, who might want to be asked again when he sees a dozen flabby fellas doing a drunken conga through the Mirqab Mall\u2019s luxury fountains while singing Vindaloo.\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\n\u201cPumping out cold air is a bit crude and then God will just make that disappear. So, we pump the exact amount of cold air in the exact place and then recycle it all the time. We never throw it away. There are grills on the floor. We take it from the top and recycle it back\u201d \u2013 Saud Abdul Ghani, aka \u2018Dr Cool\u2019, on Qatar 2022\u2019s cooling technology dealing with temperatures of up to 100F.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dr Cool giving it out.

I\u2019m 46 and willing to bet I\u2019m one of the youngest. Keep up the good, if outdated, work\u201d \u2013 Paul Buller.\n\n\u201cOne can only assume from Admir Pajic\u2019s letter on the speeded-up simulation of post-Invincibles Arsenal by modern Spurs (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters) that he\u2019s managed to forget the dire Big Cup final from a few months ago. Good for him\u201d \u2013 Christopher Smith.\n\n\u201c\u2018Max Rushden on VAR and an alternate universe\u2019 (yesterday\u2019s Still Want More?) sounds like a plot for football\u2019s first psychological-horror movie. VAR is challenging enough already, without it constantly flipping between this universe and some other, appearing and disappearing over and over again ad infinitum, like some dodgy electrical appliance on the perpetual blink. Thankfully Mr Rushden\u2019s subject transpired to be a case of some harmless alternative universe: a universe without VAR as opposed to one with VAR. Then it occurred to me that alternative universes might not be so harmless after all, as some of them could be pairs of alternate universes. At which point it occurred to me that I ought to roll all this multiverse stuff into an email and send it straight back to its source\u201d \u2013 Tony Thulborn.\n\nSend your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Tony Thulborn.\n\nBITS AND BOBS\n\nPerhaps inspired by Homer the Vigilante, Pep Guardiola keeps on digging when it comes to Bernardo Silva and that tweet to Benjamin Mendy. \u201cThe people who judge Bernardo don\u2019t know him,\u201d parped Pep. \u201cHe is an exceptional person. They judge him on one joke, I judge him on three years working with him every single day.\u201d\n\nGranit Xhaka is the new Arsenal captain after a vote among their squad for a five-man senior group.

And when we lose a game we have to trust ourselves and what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nAnd the build-up to next week\u2019s all-Brazilian Copa Libertadores semi between Gr\u00eamio and Flamengo is being overshadowed by some dismal rhetoric from the former\u2019s Renato Portaluppi about opposite number Jorge Jesus. \u201cHe\u2019s never trained a big European side outside Portugal, he\u2019s never won anything and he\u2019s 65 years old,\u201d belched Portaluppi about the three-time Primeira Liga winner.\n\nSTILL WANT MORE?\n\nDavid Hytner hears from an embattled Big Mo\u2019 Pochettino and dissects the club\u2019s current malaise.\n\nSupporting Manchester United has become far more exasperating and yet arguably far more interesting, writes Tim de Lisle with glass half-full.\n\n\u201cI had to become my own role model.\u201d Turkey women\u2019s captain Didem Karagen\u00e7 on why she considered quitting football.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Didem Karagen\u00e7, there.
