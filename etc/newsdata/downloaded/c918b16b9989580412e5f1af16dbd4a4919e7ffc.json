Thomas Piketty, the French economist, has just published his follow-up to the bestselling Capital. Titled Capital and Ideology, it expands on the themes of the first book. Sales of Capital topped 2m copies but have not put him in the running, possibly because at 48 he is too young to have built up enough citations among economists.\n\nThomas Sowell, 89, has the track record and another bestselling book under his belt, but fails to make the cut. Sowell is a senior fellow at the Hoover institution, Stanford University, and his brand of laissez-faire, anti-government economics is at the opposite end of the spectrum to the leftwing Piketty.\n\nHe has followed up Economic Facts and Fallacies, and Black Rednecks and White Liberals, with a new book, Discrimination and Disparities.\n\nClarivate Analytics said it ranked academics by the number of citations they have gathered throughout their careers because it is \u201ca quantitative narrative of how their discoveries have influenced their peers, the broader scientific community and the world at large\u201d.\n\nLast year the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which will announce the prizewinner on Monday for the Sveriges Riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel, rewarded two economists, William Nordhaus and Paul Romer.\n\nThey were honoured for their research into two of the most \u201cbasic and pressing\u201d economic issues of the age. Nordhaus, a Yale economist, told policymakers in the 1970s that their economic models were not properly taking account of the impact of global warming.\n\nRomer was praised for his work on endogenous growth theory, the notion that countries can improve their underlying performance if they concentrate on supply-side measures such as research and development, innovation and skills. Moving away from classical models that rely on the private sector to boost investment, he urges governments to intervene to boost R&D and skills.", "description": "Ariel Rubinstein, who says economics lacks common sense, heads list of likely winners", "authors": ["Phillip Inman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4353ea58ac3f92ed2afc8963715527a1ec41ebf7/0_87_3732_2239/master/3732.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5f1273ad4f7f19abc84d7864edf56579", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
