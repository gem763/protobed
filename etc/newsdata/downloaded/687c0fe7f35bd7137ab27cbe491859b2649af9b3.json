I guess I\u2019ve done so from an early age, when I wanted so fiercely to get beyond my circumstances,\" he wrote. \"That value is, Be ready.\"\n\nThe father of three continued saying that folks should be prepared for when opportunity comes because it will also go quickly.\n\n\"Miss that moment, and you\u2019ll live the rest of your life wondering just how much of your potential never played out,\" McGraw wrote. \"That\u2019s when I decided to go from being in good shape to being in the best shape of my life.\"\n\nThe 52-year-old Grammy-winning artist added the #GritandGrace hashtag to the post, referring to his book detailing his transformation set to be released in November.\n\nMore:Tim McGraw shows off big fish, more impressive abs in shirtless Instagram shot\n\nMcGraw started focusing more on his health after going sober in 2008 and has gone through a noticeable transformation, he said. The country crooner began working out twice a day and sticking to a strict diet which resulted in him losing 40 pounds.\n\n\"I\u2019ve gone through a physical transformation in the last 10 years, but it\u2019s not just my appearance that has changed,\u201d McGraw told People earlier this year. \"My mind is clearer, my sense of purpose is sharper, and my relationships are deeper. Consistent physical exercise helps me bring focus to my life and to the people who mean the most to me.\"\n\nMcGraw shared another post on Monday writing \"You gotta believe\" on a mirror and added a caption reminiscing on how he was able to overcome his struggles and get back to being in shape.\n\n\"Athleticism and sport have been intertwined into my whole way of being since an early age. It\u2019s literally in my DNA. Even so, I lost contact with that part of myself and\u2014foolishly\u2014let the fire dwindle to the point where it almost went out,\" he wrote. \"Life served me a good lesson in humility, and that led me to starting over from close to scratch. I leapt out of a slump at age forty, hit full stride at forty-five, and now at fifty-two it\u2019s coming together quite nicely.\"", "description": "Tim McGraw shared an encouraging message to Instagram about being ready so you don't miss opportunities when they come knocking.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/28/USAT/0c51d7e3-e8fe-44ef-950e-7b4e15870d27-GTY_1177648197.JPG?crop=4044,2275,x0,y119&width=3200&height=1997&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
