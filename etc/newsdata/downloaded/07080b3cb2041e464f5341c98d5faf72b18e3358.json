But according to Spears' dedicated fans, Rudolph cannot be trusted as her mouthpiece.\n\nRudolph, who's credited with discovering a 15-year-old Spears and guiding her early career, recently told TMZ that her Las Vegas residency has been effectively canceled.\n\n\"As the person who guides her career \u2014 based on the information I and all of the professionals who work with her are being told on a need-to-know basis \u2014 from what I have gathered it's clear to me she should not be going back to do this Vegas residency, not in the near future and possibly never again,\" he said.\n\nBritney Spears and Larry Rudolph in 2017. Gabe Ginsberg/Getty Images\n\nSpears recently spent time at a mental health facility in Los Angeles, which spawned the #FreeBritney movement from fans who believe she's being unfairly controlled by her 11-year-long conservatorship, which gives her father legal control over all her medical and financial decisions.\n\nRead more:Britney Spears says conspiracy theories about her life have 'gotten out of control'\n\nIt was originally reported that she checked herself into the facility. But according to a recent report from TMZ, Spears told a judge that her father had her committed and forced her to take drugs against her will.\n\nAccording to Rudolph, Spears went to the facility and postponed her Las Vegas residency because \"her meds stopped working and she was distraught over her dad's illness.\"\n\n\"I don't want her to work again 'till she's ready, physically, mentally and passionately,\" he told TMZ. \"If that time never comes again it will never come again. I have no desire or ability to make her work again. I am only here for her when she wants to work. And, if she ever does want to work again, I'm here to tell her if it's a good idea or a bad idea.\"\n\nBritney Spears and Larry Rudolph in 2011. Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic\n\nHe later clarified his comments, telling Billboard that he doesn't want media outlets \"implying that Britney will never work again.\"\n\nThat's not what I said,\" Rudolph told Billboard. \"I simply said that the Vegas residency is now officially off and that she hasn't called me in months to talk about doing anything so I'm not sure if or when she will ever want to work again. It's that simple.\"\n\nFans were reminded of Rudolph's role in sending Spears to rehab \u2014 and her subsequent 'comeback' \u2014 in 2007\n\nAmidst Spears' highly publicized struggles in 2007, which included shaving her head and multiple stints in rehab, she fired and rehired Rudolph twice.\n\nAfter firing him the second time, she mocked her reputation and management in a video for paparazzi.\n\n\"Like, oh my God! Like, the other day, like I was sitting there and I saw these magazines and they said I was pregnant, and like, it's so true. Like America, believe everything you read. Because, like, you're smart and I'm stupid. Like for real,\" she said, adopting a fake, sing-song Valley Girl accent. \"And, like, my management totally knew what they were doing when they sent me to rehab. So right, you know. Just like, I'm just gonna cry right now because the world is so nice.\"\n\nShe also wrote in an open letter to fans that Rudolph had tried to \"direct me and my life\" after her divorce.\n\nBritney Spears and Larry Rudolph at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards. Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nSpears and Rudolph eventually reconciled and he was brought back as her manager in 2008. Many fans suspect that he forcibly engineered her \"comeback\" when she wasn't ready, which included recording her 2009 album \"Circus\" and a strenuous world tour.\n\nBefore embarking on her world tour to promote \"Circus,\" Spears' former manager Johnny Write criticized her team for putting her back on the road too quickly.\n\n\"A comeback is not what I wish for Britney,\" he said. \"She is being pushed back into being a money machine. ... It's too soon for her to be a part of a manufactured machine that is pushing her to have to be a success.\"\n\nThe person who runs the popular twitter account \"pop culture died in 2009\" believes, \"the people surrounding [Spears] are questionable at best.\"\n\nMany of the account's followers agree, believing that Rudolph played a role in exploiting Spears.\n\nMuch of Spears' fanbase seems to distrust Rudolph \u2014 as well as anyone involved in Spears' conservatorship, which is currently under investigation.\n\nSome are reposting old videos of Spears that appear to show the constraints of her conservatorship and the issues with her management.\n\nRudolph's role in Spears' life at that time \u2014 and much of her life at that time in general \u2014 is primarily speculation.
