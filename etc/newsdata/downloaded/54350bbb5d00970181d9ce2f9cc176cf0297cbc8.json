Bernie Sanders (I-VT) got over 25,000 people to show up in support of his campaign at an event in Queens on Saturday, Trump was preoccupied with two entirely different ex-presidential contenders from 2016 and a current one polling in the low single digits.\n\n\u201cSo now Crooked Hillary is at it again! She is calling Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard \u2018a Russian favorite,\u2019 and Jill Stein \u2018a Russian asset.\u2019 As you may have heard, I was called a big Russia lover also (actually, I do like Russian people. I like all people!). Hillary\u2019s gone Crazy!\u201d the president tweeted.\n\nTrump was referring to a back-and-forth that erupted between Clinton allies and Gabbard, over apparent allegations that the former Democratic presidential nominee views the Hawaii congresswoman is a favorite of the Russian government. In addition, Stein, who previously launched a third-party bid, was criticized by some Clinton loyalists to have helped sway the election in the president\u2019s favor.\n\nBut as Trump fixated on Clinton and stayed silent on Sanders over the weekend, some Republicans were eyeing the force behind his rally\u2014where he was introduced by his most coveted endorser yet, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY)\u2014with fresh attention.\n\n\u201cAnyone who counted out Bernie Sanders is going to be wrong,\u201d former 2016 Trump campaign adviser Michael Caputo told The Daily Beast. \u201cI see Bernie as far more formidable now than he ever was. With the endorsements from the freshman congresswomen, I think it brings a new life back into his campaign,\u201d Caputo said, referencing both Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), who also endorsed Sanders.\n\nCaputo, a veteran Republican and pro-Trump campaign operative, sees many similarities between the Trump voters of 2016 and potential Trump or Sanders voters of 2020. With much of the presidential primary buzz centered around former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), he said it\u2019s Sanders\u2019 message that most closely aligns with swing voters, particularly in the Rust Belt, who went for Trump.\n\n\u201cWe see the support for socialism and for progressive values going up every year. Bernie Sanders brought that brand of politics to the presidential level,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d have to be pretty overconfident not to see the challenge he creates not just for Donald Trump but for the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nThe Queens rally was a must-show of force for Team Sanders. In the days leading up to the event, and following the fourth Democratic debate in Ohio, the campaign sent out emails and social media blasts in hopes of generating the kind of momentum that would be enhanced by Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s presence. In a fundraising email they called her one of \u201cthe great political phenomenons in modern American history.\u201d\n\n\u201c I see Bernie as far more formidable now than he ever was. With the endorsements from the freshman congresswomen, I think it brings a new life back into his campaign. \u201d \u2014 former 2016 Trump campaign adviser Michael Caputo\n\nSome Democratic operatives unaffiliated with any campaign publicly acknowledged the endorsement. Brian Fallon, who served as Clinton\u2019s national press secretary in 2016, wrote on Twitter \u201cfew endorsements actually matter in campaigns. But this one does.\u201d\n\nSure enough, the optics boost followed on Saturday, where Sanders beat the approximately 20,000 people that showed up at Warren\u2019s September rally in Manhattan\u2019s Washington Square Park, as well as Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 (D-CA) campaign kickoff in Oakland, California in January.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at this huge crowd, brothers and sisters, I have no doubt that the political revolution is going to sweep this country, sweep Donald Trump out of office and bring the change that this country has long needed,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nWhen asked about what Saturday\u2019s showing could mean for the campaign, veteran Republican strategist Doug Heye told The Daily Beast \u201cyou can\u2019t argue with the crowd size.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut crowd sizes alone don\u2019t win primaries and caucuses,\u201d he continued.\n\nHeye acknowledged a strong physical emergence for Sanders, but also pointed indirectly to Warren as a formidable opponent in the Democratic primary.\n\n\u201cThe Sanders campaign still needs to demonstrate what states they can win, especially when that means beating a candidate positioning herself as sort of a \u2018Bernie-lite,\u2019\u201d he said, without referencing the Massachusetts senator by name.\n\nIn the 2016 primary, Sanders won Michigan and Wisconsin against Clinton, two critical battlegrounds that ultimately went for Trump in the general election, and which a senior Trump campaign official acknowledged to reporters are top targets again.\n\nWhile Sanders didn\u2019t specify which states he\u2019ll visit next, the Vermont senator said he plans to crisscross the country with Ocasio-Cortez to campaign on behalf of working people.\n\nDuring his Saturday rally, the 78-year-old Sanders tested out a new applause line, saying he is \u201cmore than ready\u201d to take on several political hurdles to come, after questions about his age following a recent heart attack swirled around his campaign.\n\n\u201cI am more than ready to take on the greed and corruption of the corporate elite and their apologists. I am more ready than ever to create a government based on the principles of justice,\u201d Sanders said at the outdoor event. \u201cTo put it bluntly,\u201d he went on, \u201cI am back.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump has been more focused recently on Biden, primarily targeting him over debunked allegations that his son Hunter was engaged in misconduct in Ukraine and China, Republican strategists and those in the president\u2019s inner circle have recently expressed some increased anxiety over a rising Warren, The Daily Beast has reported, and some view the Democratic primary as increasingly becoming a two candidate race between Warren and Biden.\n\nBut for other Republicans, including in the Republican National Committee, Sanders is just as deserving of their attention and rapid attacks. And if the president himself is hesitant at times to jab Sanders on Twitter\u2014in contrast to a flurry of tweets he\u2019s fired off about Warren and Biden in recent months\u2014allies from the Republican Party establishment to conservative media stars are quick to pick up the slack.\n\n\u201cBernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s touting their job-killing, tax-increasing socialist agenda to rally New York liberals is about as unsurprising as it gets,\u201d RNC Spokesman Steve Guest told The Daily Beast when asked about Sanders\u2019 strength. \u201cGood luck to Democrats trying to sell these far left, fringe ideas to Americans anywhere outside of the coasts.\u201d\n\n\u201cSocialism Sucks,\u201d right-wing Internet provocateur Charlie Kirk tweeted the day after Sanders\u2019 rally. \u201cCuba is now breeding ostriches to feed its starving masses They eat \u2018steaks\u2019 made of dried grapefruit rind The Cuban Ag commissioner is encouraging people to eat rodents he says taste \u2018better than beef\u2019 This is what Bernie\u2019s America will look like.\u201d", "description": "\u201cI see Bernie as a far more formidable now than he ever was,\u201d a former Trump campaign adviser said.", "authors": ["Hanna Trudo"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571614882/191020-trudo-bernie-tease_miq5xc", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
