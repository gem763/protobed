He was not disciplined, despite an inspector general investigation concluding that he had misused his office.\n\n\u201cAccountability might not come the way we want but I think it feels much better to have gone the distance and reached a resolution,\u201d Grimes said in an interview.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Morning Money Political intelligence on Washington and Wall Street \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

In transcripts of one 2016 conversation obtained by POLITICO, Watt steered the discussion to his feelings for Grimes. In a separate encounter, he asked about a tattoo on her ankle, saying, \u201cIf I kissed that one, would it lead to more?\"\n\nThe complaint launched three investigations \u2014 by the U.S. Postal Service on behalf of the FHFA, by the FHFA inspector general, and by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\nGrimes then sued the agency in August 2018 for $1 million, alleging that the agency paid her less than the man who had held her position before her and had denied her a raise because she rejected Watt\u2019s advances.\n\nWhen Grimes complained to Watt that he hadn't addressed her pay situation, the lawsuit said, \"Director Watt directed her back to their prior conversations, asserting that, 'You didn't promise me anything, and I didn't promise you anything.'\u201d\n\nThe FHFA released a short statement today saying Grimes had raised \u201cserious issues\u201d and that the agency was \u201cpleased to have resolved these matters.\u201d\n\nWatt had refused to participate in an administrative investigation, arguing that as a presidential appointee he was exempt from the FHFA anti-harassment policy for employees that he had signed \u2014 a defense that angered lawmakers with oversight of his agency.\n\n\u201cThe statute says the policies don\u2019t apply to me; I don\u2019t know how many more times I can tell you that,\u201d Watt told the House Financial Services Committee as he angrily defended himself during the marathon hearing last September.\n\nThe imbroglio put lawmakers in an uncomfortable position. Watt, who represented a North Carolina district in Congress for two decades, had been a well-liked member of the committee and a popular figure in the Congressional Black Caucus before President Barack Obama tapped him to be the nation\u2019s top housing regulator in 2014. He was also the last remaining Obama-appointed regulator, with only months left on the job, when the scandal surfaced.\n\nIn the days after reporting the investigation last summer, POLITICO sought comment from more than two dozen lawmakers, nearly all of whom ignored requests for comment. It took the Kavanaugh allegations \u2014 which thrust Washington into a freshly partisan grappling with the #MeToo movement \u2014 to prod action on Watt.\n\n\u201cThis is a different day, and a different time,\u201d Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), then the ranking member of the committee, said during the hearing. Waters, now the chairwoman of the committee, had pushed to have Grimes testify at what had been scheduled as a routine hearing on oversight of the agency.\n\nWatt told Congress that the pending lawsuit would \u201csort through and resolve all factual and legal issues related to her claims.\u201d\n\nWatt was never deposed as a part of the suit, according to lawyers for Grimes, who said it was only after the change in leadership at the agency \u2014 new FHFA Director Mark Calabria was sworn in in April \u2014 that the agency became responsive to their concerns.\n\nWatt did submit to an interview in the inspector general probe last year, telling investigators that a recording of him saying he was attracted to Grimes meant only that he had \u201ca friendship attraction.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not persuaded by the explanations offered by the FHFA Director,\u201d the OIG wrote in its report, which was provided to a handful of officials in November and only became public in February, after Watt had stepped down.\n\nWhistleblower Aid, which hired a car to drive around Washington with a rolling billboard saying \u201cFire Mel Watt\u201d last fall, is now pushing to have the former director\u2019s retirement benefits terminated.\n\nThe group raised the idea of revoking the benefits with the White House Counsel\u2019s office, Tye said, adding that the White House said the recommendation should come from Congress.\n\nGrimes, meanwhile, remains an employee at the FHFA but said she has developed a passion for holding organizations accountable.\n\n\u201cYou go through something like this and I think it changes you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou realize how important it is for there to be more wholesale changes, and while this is a small victory there is more work to be done.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/70/c1/417980e14ad6a297aa7c7d58a220/19927-mel-watt-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
