However, since the most recent data is from 2017, the author noted that some of the states with the biggest decreases have since reversed course based on newer information ascertained at the state level.\n\nFor instance, Alaska is the state listed as having achieved the biggest decrease in their prison population, dropping 38.9% since they had their peak prison population in 2006. But, in the past two years, state lawmakers have repealed laws that experts say helped contribute to that decrease, the report says.\n\nThe report also notes that Alabama, a state where prisons are under intense scrutiny amid abuse accusations, had a 24.5% decrease in population since their peak in 2012. But monthly reports released by the state show that they had a 4% increase from September 2018 to June 2019.\n\nCharlotte Morrison, a senior attorney at the nonprofit Equal Justice Initiative, pointed to \"de-politicizing decisions around mass incarceration\" as a factor.\n\n\"Where that effort has been successful, states have made a lot of progress,\" Morrison said.\n\n\"The fact that it wasn't making the public safer and that it is so expensive has brought people together to work on ways to demarcate and reform criminal justice policy,\" Morrison said, adding that \"where that effort has been successful, states have made a lot of progress.\"\n\nChristian Science Monitor via Getty Images, FILE\n\nHowever, just as those issues were depoliticized, the pendulum can swing back the other way, and has in some instances, like in Alaska and Alabama. The report cites Alaska's Senate Bill 91, passed in 2016, which toughened penalties for major crimes and softened them for minor ones.\n\n\"A lot of the progress in recent years were undone by political decisions in those states,\" Morrison said.\n\nThe 11 states that saw increases in their populations all shared another factor in common: the peak year of their prison populations was in 2017. The data in the report suggests that as more time elapsed since a state's peak prison population, more reforms took place. For instance, among the top 10 states with the biggest decreases, their peak prison populations occurred between 1999 and 2012.\n\nThose states with increases in their prison populations are largely in the south or west, including Arkansas, which had a 23.4% increase in their prison population from 2012 to 2017, Tennessee, Kentucky, Wyoming, Nevada, South Dakota, New Mexico and Washington. Midwestern states, like Missouri, Kansas and Wisconsin, were also among those with increased prison populations.", "description": "A recent report shows that 39 states had decreases in their prison populations, but there is still concern that those overhauls can be undone quickly.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/prisoners-01-ap-jc-190923_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
