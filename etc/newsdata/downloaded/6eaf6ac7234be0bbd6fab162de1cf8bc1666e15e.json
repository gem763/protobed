Nio is just one of 486 Electric Vehicle (EV) manufacturers in China fighting for a piece of the world\u2019s largest auto market. Since the NIO stock IPO a year ago \u2014 almost exactly \u2014 quickly hit an all-time intra-day high of $13.80, a volatile path has Nio stock has down at $3.25.\n\nNIO Stock: Why There's No Rush To Buy More\n\nSource: THINK A / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe reason for this rollercoaster price action? Nio stock price has often been buoyed when it is touted in the media as the up and coming Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) of China. But then investor expectation comes back down to earth over the trade war, Nio\u2019s declining revenues and four straight quarters of losses \u2014 with no near-term turn around in sight.\n\nInvestor sentiment is decidedly skittish on the Chinese EV market \u2014 but Nio in particular. Competition is ruthless, and Nio\u2019s cash burn is turning into a forest fire. For the quarter ending December 31, Nio burned through nearly $370 million in cash. By any account, bankruptcy lawyers at major Shanghai law firms should be circling overhead ready to pounce on Nio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut when there is blood on the streets, value investors are also ready to pounce.\n\nDespite considerable downside risk, Nio stock still may represent an excellent strategic bet in the days leading to the next earnings announcement on September 24 for the second quarter of 2019.\n\nHere are three reasons why Nio stock should not be dumped just yet:\n\n1) Tencent Holdings Putting Money on Nio\u2019s Roulette Table\n\nLast week, Tencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) and NIO\u2019s CEO William Li, announced a $200 million investment into Nio\u2019s convertible debt.\n\nThis type of private placement, where Nio will pay a mere 2% interest, strongly suggests that Li was able to convince Tencent there\u2019s considerable upside in Nio stock. Convertible debt is often issued to companies with mediocre credit, but excellent long-term prospects. The debt can be converted into an option to buy equity at a price determined at issuance. Tencent is a giant Chinese conglomerate hedge fund with investments across the globe in e-commerce, gaming, internet-related services, media, entertainment, artificial intelligence, and technology.\n\nIn this case, Nio equity is dirt cheap. Tencent and it\u2019s CEO Ma Huateng \u2014 often called the Warren Buffett of China \u2014 could stand to make a multiple of their initial $200 million convertible debt investment if Nio stock price takes off. If Nio goes under, by contrast, the $200 million will likely be wiped out.\n\n2) Nio Is Not Just a Car \u2014 It\u2019s a Lifestyle Concept\n\nNio has long sought to position itself not merely as a manufacturer of metal vehicles with four wheels.\n\nInstead, much like Toyota Prius and Tesla, Nio wants to be seen as a lifestyle concept. Prius owners were not merely buying a car; they were making a statement about environmental sustainability. Similarly, Nio is positioning its product line as an uber-trendy fashion statement. This branding approach will help differentiate Nio from the massive competition in the Chinese EV market.\n\n\n\n\n\nNio is spending heavily to establish its fashion credentials. For example, according to their corporate press release, NIO and Central Saint Martins University of the Arts, the London-based art and design college, teamed up to launch their \u201cBlue Sky Thinking\u201d global community of designers. The innovative design initiative brings together design talent and creates environmentally friendly designs for not just Nio EVs, but also fashion and accessories.\n\nWhile Nio EVs may not be parading down the catwalk at New York Fashion Week, Nio nonetheless wants to be seen as a fashion must-have. And Nio is spending to create that brand identity.\n\n3) Nio Does Make a Quality Product\n\nDespite the rough start for Nio stock and its shaky top-line revenues, Nio does make a quality product.", "description": "The last year has been rough riding for investors in Nio (NYSE:NIO).
