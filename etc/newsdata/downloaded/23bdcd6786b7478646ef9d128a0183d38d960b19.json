The conclusion that Chen\u2019s work and that of other Asian-American students is somehow being devalued is not an illogical one. But at Harvard, a more accurate conclusion is that whiteness is more valuable, in many cases, than any work Chen or his fellow nonwhite applicants \u2014 Asian or otherwise \u2014 have done or could conceivably do under the present circumstances.\n\nThe broad strokes of the Harvard case are that Edward Blum, a white conservative activist, is bankrolling a legal attack on the school\u2019s admissions criteria, alleging that Harvard discriminates against applicants of Asian ancestry. His legal team\u2019s evidence includes the disproportionately low scores Asian-American students get on \u201cpersonality\u201d measures, which tend to nullify their academic achievements, allowing less \u201cobjectively\u201d qualified students to take spots that should rightfully be theirs. This amounts, Blum\u2019s team argues, to an illegal curation of incoming Harvard classes on the basis of race. It\u2019s also a sidelong approach to an issue that has long animated the 67-year-old\u2019s activism. In addition to the Harvard case \u2014 which Blum\u2019s team hopes to take to the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 he was behind the Court\u2019s gutting of the Voting Rights Act in 2013 and Abigail Fisher\u2019s failed challenge to the University of Texas admissions criteria in 2015. According to Kang, Blum\u2019s stated goal is to end the use of race as a consideration at all, not just in college admissions but in any aspect of the American legal system.\n\nThat this would likely lead to the retrenchment of white advantage in both areas is coincidental, no doubt. The biggest tell is Blum\u2019s focus on which nonwhite applicants do or don\u2019t deserve to get into traditionally white colleges, which he pursues today in partnership with Asian-American activists whose legitimate concerns about race-conscious admissions manifest in a timeworn dynamic: people of color fighting one another over whatever resources white people leave behind. But the degree to which so much of this is predetermined remains evident in the curation unfolding at Harvard, which has little to do with advancing nonwhite students into its alumni ranks. According to the Times, 30 percent of the typical incoming freshman class is allocated for applicants who fall into one of four categories, initialized as ALDC: athletes, legacies (children of Harvard graduates), applicants on the dean\u2019s or director\u2019s interest lists (often children of wealthy donors and other prominent people), and children of faculty and staff.\n\nApplicants in these categories aren\u2019t guaranteed admission, but it helps. They\u2019re admitted to Harvard at a rate of 45 percent, compared with 5 percent for the rest of the pool. And all four are overwhelmingly composed of white people, alleges Students for Fair Admissions, the activist group pursuing the lawsuit against Harvard and led by Blum. (Precise figures aren\u2019t publicly available, but past reporting is suggestive. The Times notes that applicants on the dean\u2019s or director\u2019s interest lists are \u201cmostly white\u201d; the Atlantic reports that 65 percent of student athletes at Ivy League schools are white, compared with 61 percent at colleges overall; and Harvard\u2019s admissions office declined to provide New York with a comprehensive breakdown.) With the exception of athletes, the three remaining categories share a common trait: All confer an added layer of advantage on applicants who are fortunate, privileged, or rich enough to have parents who gave Harvard lots of money, attended Harvard in the past, or work at Harvard now. That these are, by historical design, mostly white people affirms an unavoidable truth \u2014 of all the supposed race-based advantages taken into account during the college-admissions process at Harvard, whiteness may be the least discussed but the most profound.\n\nAffirmative action was originally conceived to compensate for centuries of enslaving and otherwise tormenting, degrading, and disadvantaging black Americans by law and custom. That subsequent legal decisions \u2014 like the 1978 Supreme Court case Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which ruled against the use of racial quotas in school admissions \u2014 have sapped its reparative impulses in favor of the more generalized pursuit of \u201cdiversity\u201d has made it increasingly difficult, and perhaps impossible, to realize this goal. But none of that prevents an honest discussion. Affirmative action is decried publicly as a set of unearned considerations \u2014 black students getting a leg up that is denied to white applicants, who by dint of hard work and smarts are often more qualified but were unlucky enough to be white in the post-civil-rights era. The reality is that whiteness is a product of proactive investment, not a neutral cultural identifier. Black people weren\u2019t just held back in a proverbial footrace that whites ran unencumbered; white people are ahead because whiteness was, at its inception, deliberately imbued with value that all but ensured victory.\n\nThis was as evident in the early days of the Virginia Colony \u2014 when monied landowners made it illegal for a black person to assault a white person but not vice versa \u2014 as during the New Deal era, when the single largest social-welfare investment in American history was effectively and intentionally denied to most black people. It\u2019s why Harvard\u2019s legacy regarding black Americans began with the slaves held captive by its early presidents and continues today with black students facing routine discrimination. It\u2019s why the school\u2019s legacy regarding white people began with founders, teachers, and students, and continues today with 30 percent of admission slots functionally set aside for applicants whose qualifying traits usually guarantee that they\u2019re white. Harvard is not an aberration in its struggles with racial equity. And in fact, it has shown growth: The share of black admits in particular has increased steadily over the past decade. High-profile instances of racism among admits have been handled decisively, with some even leading to offers of admission getting rescinded. All told, many at Harvard have made sincere efforts to realize the parity affirmative action once promised. But if Kang\u2019s report teaches us anything, it\u2019s that nonwhite students of all backgrounds are getting the short end of a stick whose length has always been determined by the whims and standards of white Americans. That privilege was taken by force, not earned. And at its core, the Harvard case is far less about the value deficit attached to Asian labor than the continued value invested in whiteness.", "description": "The Harvard affirmative-action lawsuit being pursued by SFFA \u2014 Students for Fair Admissions \u2014\u00a0is often cast as a referendum on how Asian-American achievement is valued differently that others\u2019.
