REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\nPrices came off their peaks after U.S. President Donald Trump authorized the use of his country\u2019s emergency stockpile to ensure stable supply.\n\nBrent crude futures, the international benchmark, rose as much as 19.5% to $71.95 per barrel, the biggest intraday jump since Jan. 14, 1991. By 1100 GMT, the contract was at $65.38, up $5.16, or 8.6%.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures climbed as much as 15.5% to $63.34, the biggest intraday percentage gain since June 22, 1998. The contract was later at $59.36, up $4.51 or 8.22%.\n\nSaudi Arabia is the world\u2019s biggest oil exporter.\n\nThe attack on state-owned producer Saudi Aramco\u2019s crude-processing facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais cut output by 5.7 million barrels per day. The company has not given a timeline for the resumption of full output.\n\nTwo sources briefed on Aramco\u2019s operations said a full return to normal production volumes \u201cmay take months\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf these outages are lengthy, Saudi Aramco will struggle to hit export specification for its Arab Light and Arab Extra Light streams, and may even be forced to declare force majeure on some of these exports,\u201d consultancy Energy Aspects said in a note.\n\n\u201cWe expect the IEA and U.S. DOE to also release strategic stocks to fill the gap if the Saudi outage is prolonged,\u201d it said, referring to the International Energy Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nTrump said he had approved the release of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve if needed. He also said the United States was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d for a potential response to the attack.\n\n(Graphic: Global oil prices spike over 10% after attacks on Saudi Arabia oil facilities, here)\n\nIt was the threat of retaliation and escalation of the tension and conflict in the Middle East, however, that has kept prices high, irrespective of the relief from global stockpiles.\n\n\u201cThis justifies a risk premium on the oil price, so prices are initially unlikely to return to the levels at which they were trading before the attacks,\u201d said Carsten Fritsch, oil analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, Germany.\n\nThe attack on plants in the heartland of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil industry, including the world\u2019s biggest petroleum-processing facility at Abqaiq, came from the direction of Iran, and cruise missiles may have been used, a U.S. official said.\n\nASIA EXPOSED, PRODUCTS IN DEMAND\n\nSaudi oil exports will continue as normal this week as the kingdom taps into stocks from its large storage facilities, an industry source briefed on the developments told Reuters.\n\nMajor importers of Saudi crude, such as India, China, Japan and South Korea, will be the most vulnerable to the supply disruption.\n\n\u201cIndia could be most exposed as its reserves are the least. China has a Strategic Petroleum Reserve and commercial crude storage, while Korea and Japan have IEA reserves to fall back on,\u201d Wood Mackenzie research director Vima Jayabalan said.\n\nSouth Korea has already said it would consider releasing oil from its strategic reserves.\n\nSaudi Arabia is set to become a significant buyer of refined products after the attacks, which may have also cut Saudi Aramco\u2019s refining capacity, consultancy Energy Aspects said.\n\nAramco Trading Company (ATC) is making enquiries to buy diesel for prompt delivery, trade sources said.\n\nU.S. gasoline futures rose as much as 12.9%, while U.S. heating oil futures gained 10.8%. China\u2019s Shanghai crude futures rose to their trading limit, gaining 8% at the open.\n\n(Graphic: Saudi Arabia crude exports to Asia vs rest of the world, here)", "description": "Oil prices surged nearly 20% at one point on Monday, with Brent crude posting its biggest intraday gain since the Gulf War in 1991, after an attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities at the weekend halved the kingdom's production.", "authors": ["Koustav Samanta", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430238786&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E0RW", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
