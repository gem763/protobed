Sure, plenty. But this is a small problem that\u2019d be easy to solve.\n\nIn 2019, almost every new vehicle comes with power windows. Though not all; you can still spec a 2020 model year work truck with cranks. (I checked.) Otherwise, a driver\u2019s window switch is often \u201cautomatic,\u201d meaning you press it once and it goes all the way down. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve experienced this before and never even thought about it. It\u2019s nice when you\u2019re commuting through a toll-both or pigging out in a drive-thru, isn\u2019t it?\n\nSome cars have one-touch driver and passenger windows, including my 14-year-old Acura. It\u2019s nothing newfangled. But still today, only really fancy stuff has it on all four window switches that the driver can reach. Why isn\u2019t that standard with all power windows?\n\nI mean, I\u2019m asking that somewhat rhetorically, because I know the answer: automakers will do whatever it takes to minimise production cost and maximise profits. Roadshow actually did a post about this last summer and explained that besides the unit cost, there are also some regulations complicating \u201cexpress-up\u201d or one-touch-up window functionality. But I\u2019d be OK with four-window auto down even if I had to hold the button again to close each window.\n\nAt any rate, I don\u2019t really care that car companies would lose a little money giving me this feature. I want my windows down and I went them down now, damn it!\n\nI feel like I\u2019m typically running my car\u2019s windows in one of two configurations: all closed, or all wide open, letting that sweet smoggy street air fly through the cabin. In such a scenario, it\u2019s mildly inconvenient to hold down more than one button. Hence, the sweetness of four auto-down switches.\n\nIn the meantime, a few seconds of casual Googling yielded at least one aftermarket option to satisfy my one-touch window desires\u2013accessory superstore AutoL\u00f6c (anybody remember its ads from tuner car mags?) has a unit it lists for $US40 ($59) per window but FYI the customer service person on the site\u2019s chat line promised a discount if you wanted a set of four.\n\nMy crippling laziness will probably prevent me from actually installing something like that in any of my cars, but nevertheless, I wish this was a thing that\u2019d start being standard fare on new cars.\n\nThe sooner it happens, the sooner I\u2019ll be able to get it in a cheap Craigslist special!", "description": "Is there anything more annoying than holding a button down for several seconds while your windows roll down?
