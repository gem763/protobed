So, there is some control and safeguard still placed on that firearm,\" Beto responded. \"Ultimately, we'd take some action to save the lives of those who are being taken and then to protect against the kind of fear these acts of terror are inspiring.\"\n\nMICHAEL FLYNN'S CLAIM AGAINST FBI IS 'CHILLING', SAYS FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY BRETT TOLMAN\n\nAppearing on \"Fox & Friends: Weekend\" with hosts Ed Henry, Jedidiah Bila, and Pete Hegseth, Jones said that Beto should be \"made fun of\" for having no information or authority on the issue.\n\n\"I mean, that is almost a kid that just called him out on a very simple thing,\" he said.\n\n\"I am a disabled hunter, right? Both my wrists are fused, my shoulders are fused, I need a pistol grip, and a semi-automatic gun to go hunt. Guess what that is? That's an AR-15, an AR-10. That's a military weapon of war, as he would call it,\" he explained. \"Which is really just a sporting rifle.\"\n\n\"And, the truth is Beto doesn't understand what he's talking about but he needs...this flashpoint to try and stir controversy and get votes and it's just not happening for him,\" said Jones.\n\n\"Is he completely unaware that there are people around the country that utilize that weapon to protect themselves and their families?\" Bila asked.\n\n\"Well, he's not unaware. He just thinks that his best chance of getting people to support him right now is to have a controversial issue that he can get 49 percent of people to agree with,\" he told the \"Friends\" couch.\n\nJones said that, while guns are in common use, they're not in common use against each other.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"And, in a country that's free, that matters,\" he added. \"We don't ban alcohol. We don't ban things that can harm us just because they don't save lives in hospitals. So, the idea that guns are used in self-defense, or hunting, or for sport, or as an ornament in my safe, those are all equally justifiable reasons that I should be able to own one...\"\n\n\"And so, that's not to say we should accept it, but we don't fix it by simply banning something that's so commonly used legally,\" he concluded.\n\nFox News' Joseph Wulfsohn contributed to this report.", "description": "2020 presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke \"has no idea what he's talking about\" when explaining his gun buyback proposal, Fox News contributor Johnny Joey Jones said Saturday.", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Johnny-Joey-Jones-Beto-Orourke.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
