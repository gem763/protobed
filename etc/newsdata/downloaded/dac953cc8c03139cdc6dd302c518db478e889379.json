Shane Gillis was dropped from the lineup after several clips were spread online in which Gillis used racial slurs and made derogatory statements about Asians, Jews, gay people and other groups.\n\nGillis responded to the clips with a statement calling himself \u201ca comedian who pushes boundaries\u201d and said his \u201cintention is never to hurt anyone.\u201d The show announced it was ending its relationship with him in light of what it called his \u201coffensive, hurtful and unacceptable\u201d language.\n\nSince debuting in 1975, \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d has featured a number of sketches with Asian characters that would be considered offensive by today\u2019s standards \u2014 most famously John Belushi\u2019s depiction of a samurai in the show\u2019s early years. \u201cSNL\u201d has also been criticized for a perceived lack of diversity in its cast. One of the hires announced alongside Gillis was Bowen Yang, the show\u2019s first-ever series regular of East Asian descent.\n\nRecently the show has drawn the ire of Republicans for its lampooning of President Trump and his advisers. Hiring Gillis was reportedly part of an effort to improve the show\u2019s standing among conservatives.\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate:\n\nGillis\u2019s firing was sharply criticized by a number of comedians, including former \u201cSNL\u201d cast members. Rob Schneider said Gillis was a victim of \u201cthis era of cultural unforgiveness.\u201d David Spade slammed the public\u2019s impulse to \u201crifle through your past\u201d in search of reasons to get a person fired. Though most agreed that Gillis\u2019s jokes were out of line, some comics argued that the craft of comedy would be crippled if its practitioners had their careers derailed by so-called cancel culture every time they pushed boundaries a bit too far.\n\nGillis also received support from one of the targets of his racist remarks, Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who said society would benefit from being \u201cmore forgiving rather than punitive.\u201d\n\nOthers say Gillis\u2019s comments went far beyond the bounds of what is acceptable and that he deserved to be fired. Actress Sandra Oh, who has hosted \u201cSNL,\u201d tweeted that she was happy with the show\u2019s choice to not \u201clegitimize/give platform 2 purveyors of racist homophobic content.\u201d Railing against cancel culture, some argue, is a diversionary tactic used by people facing legitimate consequences for inappropriate behavior.\n\nWhat\u2019s next\n\nThe controversy doesn\u2019t seem to have hindered Gillis\u2019s plans to pursue a career in comedy. In his first standup set after being fired, Gillis said he\u2019s \u201cfine with the consequences\u201d of his statements, adding, \u201cI\u2019ve been reading every one of my death threats in an Asian accent.\u201d Yang said he and Gillis \u201cwill be sitting down together soon.\u201d The 45th season of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d premieres Sept. 28.\n\nPerspectives\n\nHe should have kept his job\n\nThe comments should not have cost him his job\n\n\u201cThis is just cancel culture. The guy shouldn\u2019t have been fired. It was just a couple things back in his history.\u201d \u2014 Jim Jefferies, \u201cLights Out With David Spade\u201d\n\nFiring Gillis was an overreaction\n\n\u201cGillis\u2019s bit was pretty awful. He shouldn\u2019t have said what he said. It also wasn\u2019t funny. On the other hand, firing someone is a drastic step, particularly for someone at this stage of his career.\u201d \u2014 Kyle Smith, National Review\n\nCancel culture needs to stop\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really willing to defend Shane Gillis, some of the things that he said. ... I also hate with every fiber of my being this phenomenon where someone is coming to prominence or has a good day and there\u2019s a group of people out there who just go looking for ways to tear that person down and find the worst thing about them and try to get them fired.\u201d \u2014 Guy Benson, Fox Nation\n\nThe controversy may end up being good for Gillis\u2019s career\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of people cheering that Gillis isn\u2019t getting this job, they think it\u2019s going to be bad for his career. I really don\u2019t think so. This has potentially given him way more attention than he would have gotten as being kind of just one of the new guys on SNL. ... He could definitely ride this wave of people that see this as PC culture run amok.\u201d \u2014 Philip DeFranco, \u201cPhilip DeFranco Show\u201d", "description": "\"Saturday Night Live\" fired Shane Gillis after a series of clips surfaced in which he made a number of offensive jokes.
