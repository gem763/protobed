Rather, it is about the conservative voice countering the elitist views of those in the predominately left-wing industry.\n\n\u201cBreitbart nation and your listeners and readers have been so kind, so let\u2019s keep this going,\u201d Spicer told Breitbart News Washington Political Editor Matthew Boyle.\n\nSpicer made it another week on DWTS along with every other competitor, as everyone \u2013 in a surprise twist \u2013 was safe from elimination during Disney week. Monday\u2019s show will essentially combine the scores from last week, making votes even more crucial. While the show did not reveal who was in the bottom two, Spicer \u2013 who has yet to find himself in that category \u2013 got higher scores from the judges last week and was encouraged by them recognizing his progress.\n\nBoyle mentioned a Newsweek article that quoted DWTS dancer Cheryl Burke, who said that Spicer could very well make it to the end\u2013 an admission made after President Trump tweeted his support of Spicer.\n\nVote for good guy @seanspicer tonight on Dancing With The Stars. He has always been there for us! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2019\n\n\u201cTrump tweeted for Sean Spicer! I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if he made the final,\u201d Burke said.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Lindsay [Arnold, Spicer\u2019s dancing partner], just wait, you\u2019re gonna make the finals.\u2019 She\u2019s like, \u2018No way.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, for sure you are.\u2019 To have the President of the United States tweeting for every one vote for Sean Spicer?\u201d she said, according to Newsweek.\n\n\u201cBristol Palin made the final in a gorilla suit,\u201d she said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t the best dancer, but people wanted her there. So at the end of the day, you know, I wouldn\u2019t be shocked,\u201d she added.\n\nSpicer said Burke recognizes that there is a movement.\n\n\u201cThe difference between me and a lot of the folks who are on the show is that they might be an actor, an athlete, or musician, and they have a natural fan base that\u2019s voting for them because they like their music or think they\u2019re a good actor,\u201d Spicer explained, emphasizing that his presence on the show is not about him, but a greater message to Hollywood about the magnitude of the conservative voice.\n\n\u201cI think the difference that I have \u2013 and I\u2019ve said this to you before \u2013 that it\u2019s not just about me. It\u2019s about we. And I think people \u2013 that you know your listeners, your readers, everyone \u2013 recognizes that the further I go, it\u2019s more about all of us,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about like showing that \u2018hey we are active, we are engaged, we view these shows.\u2019 It reminds people that, you know, you can\u2019t overlook half of the equation if you will, and so that\u2019s good,\u201d he added.\n\nSpicer reminded listeners that it is the bottom two at play\u2013 a position he has never been in despite struggling to get high scores from the judges. That speaks volumes, Spicer says, to the number of people voting.\n\n\u201cSo tomorrow night I think \u2013 I hate to say this \u2013 it\u2019s going to be a \u201cbig test,\u201d Spicer said, \u201cbecause right now, there is a disparity.\u201d\n\nHe continued:\n\nSo if you look where I am in terms of the judge\u2019s side and dancing ability, you know there\u2019s no question that these other folks\u2013 a lot of them have much more natural ability than I do. But if we can make it through tomorrow night, I think that will really tell the difference between where we stand in the big picture, because we\u2019ll now have gone through four eliminations and five shows. So tomorrow night is going to be a big test of getting people out there and it\u2019s tough. It\u2019s a Monday night. There\u2019s a lot of things going on for folks in terms of their families and their kids.\n\nThe former White House press secretary also hearkened to the promise of boycotts that took place after he was initially announced on the show. The show\u2019s ratings, he said, do not reflect those threats.\n\nSpicer said it proves that there \u201care folks out there \u2013 whether in flyover country or not \u2013 that are actively engaged in some way, shape, or form as viewers, readers, or voters.\n\n\u201cThe more that we remember that\u2013 it\u2019s good business frankly,\u201d he added.\n\nViewers can vote for Spicer and his dancing partner, Lindsay Arnold, between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. EST by texting SEAN to 21523 up to ten times and voting on ABC.com up to ten times.", "description": "Former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told Breitbart News that Monday's Dancing with the Stars is 'not just about me, it\u2019s about we'", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/GettyImages-1163047092-1-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
