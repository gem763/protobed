Ahmet Bolat/Pool via REUTERS\n\nISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey\u2019s government has no plan to replace the opposition mayors of Istanbul and Ankara with state-appointed trustees, as was done to three Kurdish mayors in the country\u2019s east last month, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said on Sunday.\n\nSoylu had threatened last week \u201cto devastate\u201d Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, of the main opposition Republican People\u2019s Party (CHP), over his support for the ousted mayors of the cities of Diyarbakir, Van and Mardin.\n\nBut in a CNN Turk interview on Sunday, Soylu said: \u201cFor Istanbul and Ankara, for such thing to be in question (appointment of a trustee) is not possible.\u201d\n\nThe three mayors were removed over alleged terror links less than five months after they were elected, sparking sharp criticism from the opposition including Ankara\u2019s CHP mayor Mansur Yavas.\n\nImamoglu - whose election in June dealt President Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s AK Party (AKP) a shock defeat - has labelled the move illegal and undemocratic and called for it to be reversed. He visited two of the ousted mayors in Diyarbakir last month.\n\nImamoglu on Sunday dismissed Soylu\u2019s threat as \u201cupsetting\u201d politics.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t become a tradition in this country to blame someone without any judgment. It is against jurisdiction and law,\u201d Imamoglu said at a news conference to discuss what he called wasted public funds under previous AKP administrations.\n\n\u201cAll of the 82 million people in Turkey are my citizens... What I did was in line with the law and for propagating the national sentiment to all around the country,\u201d he said of his visit to Diyarbakir.\n\nHis municipality has parked in an Istanbul lot hundreds of cars it says were rented by previous administrations and that represent wasted public funds. He said the cars would be returned and the money spent on public parks.", "description": "Turkey's government has no plan to replace the opposition mayors of Istanbul and Ankara with state-appointed trustees, as was done to three Kurdish mayors in the country's east last month, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427566891&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870E0", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
