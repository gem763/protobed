(Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters)\n\nRules would stabilize FB and protect it from competition.\n\nHere\u2019s a bet: Congress will end up \u201ccracking down\u201d on Facebook with \u201ctough\u201d regulations that Facebook will probably protest quite vigorously.\n\nAnd then Facebook profits will go up.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of Facebook, withstood two days of questioning in Congress this week. You could tell Zuckerberg took it very seriously, not least because he shed his traditional T-shirt and hoodie in favor of a grown-up suit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain and again, he was asked whether he was opposed to regulation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou embrace regulation?\u201d asked Senator Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.).\n\n\u201cI think the real question, as the Internet becomes more important in people\u2019s lives, is what is the right regulation, not whether there should be or not,\u201d Zuckerberg responded.\n\nMany are focusing (understandably) on Zuckerberg\u2019s stance on the countless and complex free-speech issues raised by Facebook\u2019s dominance and reach. Zuckerberg kept suggesting that artificial intelligence could soon solve most of these problems by policing \u201chate speech\u201d and perhaps \u201cfake news\u201d faster than human monitors ever could.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSenator Ben Sasse (R., Neb.) had a brilliant line of questioning that exposed at least some of the problems with handing over these responsibilities to the real-world equivalent of HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey or Skynet from the Terminator movies.\n\n\u201cCan you define hate speech?\u201d Sasse asked.\n\nZuckerberg admitted that beyond calls for violence, he couldn\u2019t come up with a definition of the sort of speech that should be banned by an algorithm.\n\nAdded Zuckerberg:\n\nI do generally agree with the point that . . . as we\u2019re able to technologically shift toward especially having AI proactively look at content, I think that that\u2019s going to create massive questions for society about what kinds of obligations we want to require companies to fulfill.\n\nThat is both an impressive understatement and a topic we\u2019ll all be returning to often in the years to come.\n\nBut let\u2019s assume Zuckerberg is correct. In the future, much of our speech will be policed by our robot overlords.\n\nAs Zuckerberg hinted more than a few times, political leaders will need to get involved in the regulation and administration of how these AI systems will work. We\u2019ll probably set up some new agency or a new division of the FCC to provide oversight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd which company will have the loudest voice in the drafting of these new rules? If history is any guide, the obvious answer is . . . Facebook.\n\nThe standard story of the Progressive era, taught to high-school kids and college students alike, is that the government has come to the rescue time and again to curtail the excesses of irresponsible, selfish, or otherwise dastardly big businesses. Upton Sinclair, in his book The Jungle, famously exposed the abuses of the meat-packing industry, prompting the government to impose new regulations on it.\n\nLeft out of this tale of enlightened regulation is that the meat-packing industry wanted to be regulated \u2014 something even Sinclair admitted.\n\n\u201cThe Federal inspection of meat was, historically, established at the packers\u2019 request,\u201d Sinclair wrote in 1906. \u201cIt is maintained and paid for by the people of the United States for the benefit of the packers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe famous trusts were no different. In 1909, Andrew Carnegie wrote a letter to the New York Times suggesting \u201cgovernment control\u201d of the steel industry. The chairman of U.S. Steel, Judge Elbert Gary, lobbied for the same thing.\n\nI suspect one reason Zuckerberg wants AI to be essential is that Facebook can afford to make AI essential while potential competitors can\u2019t.\n\nThe story repeated itself during the New Deal. The \u201cmalefactors of great wealth\u201d that FDR demonized welcomed government regulation. Famed lawyer Clarence Darrow issued a report on the New Deal\u2019s industrial \u201ccodes.\u201d In \u201cvirtually all the codes we have examined, one condition has been persistent, \u201cDarrow found. \u201cIn Industry after Industry, the larger units . . . have for their own advantage written the codes, and then, in effect and for their own advantage, assumed the administration of the code they have framed.\u201d\n\nWhy would the titans of capitalism welcome regulation? Because regulation is the best protection against competition. It stabilizes prices, eliminates uncertainty, and writes profits into law \u2014 which is why AT&T convinced Congress at the beginning of the 20th century to give it a monopoly over phone services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t know what the regulation of Facebook will look like. But I suspect one reason Zuckerberg wants AI to be essential is that Facebook can afford to make AI essential while potential competitors can\u2019t.\n\nRegardless, I have confidence that when all is said and done, Facebook will look more like the 21st-century AT&T of social media.\n\n\u00a9 2018 Tribune Content Agency, LLC", "description": "Why would Zuckerberg & other titans of capitalism welcome regulation?
