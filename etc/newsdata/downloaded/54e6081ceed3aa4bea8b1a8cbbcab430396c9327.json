This issue only affects devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between October 2018 to August 2019.\u201d\n\nThe program\u2019s page asks users to enter their phone\u2019s serial number to check if it qualifies for a free repair. Eligible devices can be serviced at an Apple Store, an Apple Authorised Service Provider, or through a mail-in service with Apple Repair Centre.\n\nNow to be clear, this new program isn\u2019t a catch-all tune-up for whatever problems your phone may already have. If it\u2019s already sporting a busted screen or other damage that \u201cimpairs the ability\u201d of Apple\u2019s techs to fix this start-up issue, you could still end up getting a bill for those extra repairs.\n\nAnother caveat, because of course there\u2019s more: This offer only covers 6s and 6s Plus phones for two years after first purchase, so time\u2019s a\u2019 ticking. Finally, if you\u2019ve already paid to fix the problem yourself (after all, what kind of heathen survives without a phone these days) you may be eligible for a refund via Apple support.\n\nAfter launching the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in 2015, Apple quietly killed off the series last year, thus ending the last generation in the company\u2019s numbered iPhone line to host a headphone jack. Enough users refusing to give up on that creature comfort may explain why the 6s and 6s Plus remain the oldest iPhones supported by Apple\u2019s iOS13, according to Ars Technica. And why Apple is launching a new repair service for a four-year-old phone in the first place.", "description": "If you\u2019re an Apple user who\u2019s still rocking an iPhone 6s or 6s Plus and it suddenly started refusing to turn on, don\u2019t worry: It\u2019s Apple\u2019s fault, not yours....", "authors": ["Cheryl Eddy", "Tom Mckay"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/1464336897250060947.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
