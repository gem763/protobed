Ltd. ESALY, +34.65% 4523, -0.29% said its decision to pursue approval of aducanumab, an treatment for early Alzheimer\u2019s diseases was made after the drug met the primary endpoint of a Phase 3 Emerge study, and after consulting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nBiogen said results from a Phase 3 Engage study of a subset of patients did not meet its primary endpoint, but supported the findings from the Emerge study.\n\nBiogen\u2019s stock rocketed 27.1% on heavy volume in morning trading Tuesday. That would be just shy of the stock\u2019s biggest one-day percentage gain since the company went public in September 1991, which was a 27.5% rally on April 20, 1999.\n\nTrading volume swelled to 11.4 million shares, compared with the full-day average of about 1.8 million shares. The stock\u2019s price gain of $60.60 has boosted Biogen\u2019s market capitalization by $11.2 billion to $52.4 billion.\n\nThe upbeat trial results comes seven months after Biogen\u2019s stock plummeted, falling 29.2% on March 21, after Biogen and Eisai said it had decided to discontinue Phase 3 Emerge and Engage trials of aducanumab, after a futility analysis indicated the trials were unlikely to meet their primary endpoints.\n\nDespite Tuesday\u2019s rally, the stock was still below where it was--$320.59--just prior to the news that the trials would be discontinued.\n\nBiogen said Tuesday that a new \u201cextensive analysis\u201d of additional data from a larger dataset showed a \u201cdifferent outcome than the outcome predicted by the futility analysis.\u201d The company then consulted with the FDA on the different results and implications.\n\n\u201cThis large dataset represents the first time a Phase 3 study has demonstrated that clearance of aggregated amyloid beta can reduce the clinical decline of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, providing new hope for the medical community, the patients, and their families,\u201d said Anton Porsteinsson, a director at the University of Rochester Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Care, Research and Education Program and principal investigator. \u201cThere is tremendous unmet medical need, and the Alzheimer\u2019s disease community has been waiting for this moment.\u201d\n\nBiogen plans to file a Biologics License Application (BLA) for aducanumab in early 2020.\n\nAnalyst Yatin Suneja at Guggenheim said in a research note titled, \u201cJust in Time for Halloween, Aducanumab Has Risen from the Dead,\u201d that he believes aducanumab, if approved, \u201chas the potential to completely change the profile of the company.\u201d\n\nHe said he expects the stock could \u201cre-rate\u201d and return to its trading range of $300 to $360 before the futility analysis results announced in March, at least until the FDA\u2019s decision on the BLA. Suneja has been neutral on Biogen\u2019s stock since February, and currently has a $256 stock price target.\n\nMizuho\u2019s Salim Syed kept his rating at neutral, saying that while the aducanumab news \u201csounds\u201d positive, FDA approval is not guaranteed as questions remain.\n\nSyed remains skeptical given that two similar studies, Emerge and Engage, had different results.\n\n\u201cBIIB is pretty explicit even in its slides this morning that EMERGE (the trial that worked) and ENGAGE (that trial that failed, but seemed to work in the high dose) are identically designed studies,\u201d Syed wrote in a note to clients. \u201cSo the question here is why would two identically designed studies have disparate results.\u201d\n\nAdding to investor optimism, Biogen also reported a big earnings beat, citing a solid performance from its multiple sclerosis (MS) treatments and a strong growth in its spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) drug Spinraza.\n\nNet income increased to $1.55 billion, or $8.39 a share, from $1.44 billion, or $7.15 a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding non-recurring items, such as acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, adjusted earnings per share rose to $9.17 from $7.40, above the FactSet consensus of $8.28.\n\nRevenue grew 5% to $3.60 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $3.54 billion. Revenue from Biogen\u2019s best selling drug, MS treatment Tecfidera, grew 3% to $1.12 billion to match the FactSet consensus, while Spinraza revenue jumped 17% to $547 million to beat expectations of $488 million.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the recent news on aducanumab, we made strong progress in our pipeline as we initiated new clinical programs targeting Parkinson\u2019s disease and brain contusion, and we look forward to nine important data readouts by the end of next year,\u201d said Chief Executive Michel Vounatsos. \u201cWe continue to believe that our core focus on neuroscience will lead to new innovative treatments for patients and will maximize long-term returns for our shareholders.\u201d\n\nBiogen\u2019s stock has now lost 5.6% year to date, while the SPDR Health Care Select Sector exchange-traded fund XLV, +0.97% has rallied 7.1% and the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.13% has climbed 20.2%.", "description": "Shares of Biogen Inc. blasted off Tuesday, after the biotechnology company said its Alzheimer\u2019s treatment is ready to start the regulatory approval process,...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GC282_biogen_ZG_20180123132844.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
