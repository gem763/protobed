Forecasters warned the combination of heavy, wet snow, strong winds and bitter cold expected could set new records across the northwestern United States and southern Canada this early in the season.\n\n\"The snow that began to ramp up in the higher elevations of the Northwest on Saturday morning will only worsen and spread to lower elevations into Saturday night,\" AccuWeather Meteorologist Renee Duff said.\n\nBy Saturday afternoon local time, snowfall in Browning, Montana, nearly reached 2 feet, measuring 23 inches of total snowfall at 4:10 p.m. MDT.\n\nAhead of the storm, Glacier National Park in Montana announced road closures. While St. Mary Campground remains open, \"camping not advised\" signs have been put in place.\n\n\"The snow can pile up at quick pace, with more than an inch per hour possible,\" Duff said. By early afternoon local time, 13 inches of snow had been reported near Choteau, Montana. The report also mentioned that ice has started to cover highways that were previously plowed.\n\nDue to severe winds, officials in Choteau, Montana, reported numerous downed power lines and trees on Saturday around noon, which created dangerous conditions.\n\n\"Strong winds accompanying the snow threaten to topple trees and power lines, as well as cause near-zero visibility and extensive blowing and drifting,\" Duff said.\n\nTree branches were starting to be weighed down by snow on Saturday morning in Montana.\n\n\"People are urged to not travel during the storm as there will be a heightened risk of becoming stranded in sub-freezing temperatures. If you must travel, make sure you have a fully charged cellphone, blankets and an emergency kit in your vehicle,\" Duff said. \"Road closures are possible due to the poor driving conditions and debris blocking the roadway.\"\n\nThe live updates for this storm have been discontinued as of 7 p.m. MDT.\n\n5:30 p.m. MDT Saturday\n\nBrowning, Montana, was closing in on 2 feet of snowfall at 4:10 p.m. MDT.

Another report found that East Glacier Park, Montana, had also received 21 inches of snow.\n\nHighways across northwestern Montana are experiencing reduced visibility due to blowing and drifting snow, according to the Montana Department of Transportation. The RWIS cameras that show more than just the white blur of snow show wintry scenes, the roads the only color peaking out from under the white snow.\n\nVisibility has been greatly reduced along highways in northwestern Montana amid blowing and drifting snow. This image was taken during the afternoon of Saturday, Sept. 28, in Browning, Montana, and was one of the few images of the area that showed better visibility.
