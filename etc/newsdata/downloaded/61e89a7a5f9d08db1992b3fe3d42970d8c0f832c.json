But for the past few years, the company has also been branching into the smartwatch world to compete with the likes of the Apple Watch and Samsung\u2019s wearable lineups. Fitbit even purchased the remains of Pebble to help facilitate this.\n\nLast year\u2019s Versa was the company\u2019s best effort in making a competent smartwatch. It was comfortable to wear, had great battery life, and included all of Fitbit\u2019s advanced fitness and sleep-tracking features. But at the same time, it fell far short of other smartwatches on the market, with poor notification support and lack of productivity features.\n\nThe new $199.99 Versa 2, which hits stores on September 15th, is the company\u2019s latest smartwatch effort. As you can tell from the name, it\u2019s an evolution of the Versa, with a few design tweaks, a handful of new features, and the same price. It is a better Versa and an excellent fitness tracker. But overall, it\u2019s not a better smartwatch.\n\nOur review of Fitbit Versa 2 Verge Score 6.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Comfortable, lightweight design\n\nWeek-long battery life\n\nScreen is bright and easy to see outdoors\n\nGreat fitness and sleep-tracking features\n\nVoice replies are handy for Android users Bad Stuff Changing straps is still a huge chore, despite the quick-release pins\n\nAlways-on display is too simple and not customizable enough\n\nAlexa integration is clumsy and largely pointless\n\nSmartwatch productivity features are lacking Buy for $199.95 from Fitbit Buy for $199.95 from Best Buy\n\nThe original Versa was one of the most comfortable smartwatches you could wear and the Versa 2 is just as pleasant on the wrist. It\u2019s not too large, not too small, and should be fine on a wide variety of wrist sizes. It\u2019s also very lightweight and the tapered design hides the bulk of the watch well. The Versa 2 is one of the few wearables that I\u2019ve been able to comfortably wear 24/7, even while sleeping.\n\nThe general design of the Versa 2 is the same as before, but Fitbit has simplified the interactions down from the previous multibutton setup to a single button on the left and the touchscreen. The watch doesn\u2019t lose any functionality, however \u2014 you can still do all of the same things with the Versa 2 as could be done with the first Versa.\n\nI do wish Fitbit had made it easier to change straps on this model \u2014 the Versa straps have quick-release pins, but the mount is so recessed into the watch\u2019s body that getting the pins to click into place is very difficult, especially with the rubber strap that\u2019s included in the box. My review kit included a very comfortable perforated leather strap that was much easier to install, but that will cost you $50 extra.\n\nFitbit has traded the Versa\u2019s LCD panel for an OLED screen and this is the best upgrade that the Versa 2 brings. It\u2019s bright, colorful, and easy to see both indoors and out. I was able to view the screen with no problem in direct sunlight and through polarized sunglasses. The OLED panel also enables the new always-on display feature, which lets you always see the time or your workout progress. But the always-on feature has very limited customizability (you can choose between digital or analog clocks and that\u2019s it) and it disables the raise-to-wake feature, so you have to double-tap the screen or press the side button to wake the watch.\n\nUnfortunately, the display is still surrounded by a thick, chunky bezel, which has the effect of making it look even smaller than the postage-stamp size that it is. On the plus side, the Versa 2 ditches the tacky \u201cFitbit\u201d branding that was below the screen on the first-gen model.\n\nThe Versa 2\u2019s battery life is stellar\n\nLike the Versa, the Versa 2 has excellent battery life; it easily hit the five-day mark for me in testing. If you use the always-on display feature, you can expect that figure to roughly drop by half. Two to three days between charges is still excellent battery life for a smartwatch and more than I\u2019ve gotten from any other smartwatch I\u2019ve worn.\n\nFitbit has also added a microphone to the Versa 2, giving it some limited voice control abilities. There\u2019s no speaker, so you can\u2019t use it as a speakerphone, but if you have it paired to an Android device, you can speak replies to messages and it will turn those into text. (Sorry iPhone users, you still can\u2019t reply to messages at all with the Versa 2.) This worked well in my tests, with quick and accurate transcriptions of my voice. It does take two or three taps on the screen to record a voice reply, which is a bit tedious, and you can\u2019t actually initiate a new message by voice \u2014 you can only reply to incoming ones, so there is room for improvement here.\n\nThe microphone also comes into play with the new Alexa features. Long-press the side button and Alexa will open, from which you can ask it questions or tell it to do Alexa-related tasks like control smart home gadgets, set timers, or show you the weather. Since the Versa 2 doesn\u2019t have a speaker, all of Alexa\u2019s replies are displayed on the screen and it can\u2019t do things like play music or any other audio-related task. Alexa also can\u2019t actually control the watch \u2014 everything you ask Alexa to do is contained within Alexa\u2019s interface, including timers, alarms, and other features. You can\u2019t ask Alexa to send a text message or place a call from your phone, like you might do with Siri on an Apple Watch. You can\u2019t even start a workout with Alexa. Nor can you activate Alexa with a voice command \u2014 the only way to launch Alexa is to long-press the side button or tap the icon in the quick settings panel, which turns using Alexa into a slow, two-handed process.\n\nFitbit says these limitations are in place to preserve battery life and prevent errant activations of Alexa, but the effect is that oftentimes it\u2019s more annoying to use Alexa on the Versa 2 than it\u2019s worth. There just doesn\u2019t seem like much point.\n\nThe Alexa feature is frustratingly limited and clumsy to access\n\nThe watch carries over all of the fitness features from the first Versa, including intelligent workout detection, always-on heart rate monitoring, and sleep-tracking features. New this year is a Sleep Score, which tries to condense your sleep-tracking data into an \u201cX out of 100\u201d score, rating how well you slept. In my time testing the Versa 2, I averaged a Sleep Score of 76, which the app ranks as \u201cfair.\u201d Fitbit says this feature will come to all of its devices that have heart rate monitors.\n\nThere\u2019s also a new Sleep Mode for the watch that disables the display from lighting up or notifications from buzzing while you\u2019re sleeping, which seems like something that should have probably been available on last year\u2019s model, but I\u2019m glad it\u2019s here now. You can initiate the Sleep Mode from the quick settings screen on the watch or through the smartphone app, where you can also set it to turn on and off automatically based on a schedule. Finally, Fitbit says it is working on a Smart Wake alarm feature that will attempt to wake you up at the optimal point in your sleep cycle, but it won\u2019t be arriving until later this year and I was unable to test it.\n\nOverall, the Versa 2\u2019s fitness tracking features are the best and most comprehensive you\u2019ll find on any smartwatch, even though it doesn\u2019t have a dedicated GPS radio and relies on your phone for GPS tracking.\n\nOf course, you can get all of those same fitness tracking features in one of Fitbit\u2019s other products for less money, so the main reason you\u2019d spring for the Versa over a Charge 3 or Inspire HR is for its smartwatch features. And that\u2019s where the Versa 2 runs into many of the similar problems as its predecessor.\n\nThe Versa includes a Spartan number of apps out of the box, and you won\u2019t find productivity staples like a calendar or reminders. Fitbit boasts of over 3,000 third-party watchfaces and apps available to install via the smartphone app, but aside from a handful of exceptions like Uber and NY Times, there aren\u2019t many popular names in the collection. Should you encounter a paid app, of which there are many, you\u2019ll have to pay the developer directly through whatever payment system they choose to use, because Fitbit\u2019s store doesn\u2019t have a payments system of its own in place for apps or watchfaces.\n\nChanging watchfaces on the Versa 2 is a tedious process\n\nSpotify has joined Pandora and Deezer as a music option on the watch, but the Versa app only lets you control Spotify playback on other devices \u2014 it doesn\u2019t let you download or stream Spotify to the watch itself, making it mostly useless.\n\nWatchfaces are a particular sore point. The Versa 2 can only store one watchface at a time, so when you want to try a different look, you have to replace the watchface through the mobile app and send it to the watch. If you want to switch back to the watchface you were just using, you have to go through the whole process of searching for it in Fitbit\u2019s app and redownloading it to the watch \u2014 there\u2019s no way to even store a set of favorites in the app for quick access, much less multiple looks on the watch at any given time. On top of that, the vast majority of the watchfaces available look second-rate and don\u2019t match the sleek hardware of the Versa 2. The whole process just feels horribly clumsy compared to how easy it is to customize watchfaces on the other smartwatch platforms.\n\nFinally, while it\u2019s nice that Fitbit\u2019s mobile payment system, Fitbit Pay, is available on all versions of the Versa 2, I was unable to test it because it doesn\u2019t support my local credit union and has a far smaller number of supported banks and financial institutions than Apple Pay, Google Pay, or Samsung Pay (all of which support my credit union).\n\nFitbit tells me it refrained from adding too many smartwatch features because its customers don\u2019t want to be burdened with too many things they won\u2019t necessarily use. But if that\u2019s the case, they should probably just buy a Charge 3 instead of a Versa 2, which has the same set of fitness tracking features, costs less, and is smaller to boot. If the company is going to be serious about competing on a smartwatch level, then it needs to do better at smartwatch functions.\n\nThe Versa 2 is indeed a better product than the Versa, and the design changes and new features are mostly welcome. But it\u2019s not any more compelling of a device than before: it\u2019s an excellent fitness tracker, but if you\u2019re looking for a smartwatch, you can be better served by an Apple Watch or one of Samsung\u2019s offerings for Android devices.", "description": "The Versa 2 is Fitbit\u2019s latest smartwatch, and while it\u2019s better than its predecessors, it still struggles with being a top-tier smartwatch.", "authors": ["Dan Seifert", "Sep", "Photography Amelia Holowaty Krales"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QnsiepvJohG8-VJYiHcoSuUf4xg=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19168640/akrales_190903_3635_0219.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
