(Christopher Jue/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver on Tuesday attempted to clarify the league\u2019s stance toward China, saying in a statement the NBA will not censor players or team executives who have views on human-rights issues. The statement came one day after the league was criticized for its initial response to Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey\u2019s tweet in support of protesters in Hong Kong, one seen by many as deferential to the league\u2019s Chinese business interests.\n\n[NBA under fire from all directions after response to Rockets-China incident]\n\n\u201cIt is inevitable that people around the world \u2014 including from America and China \u2014 will have different viewpoints over different issues. It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences,\u201d Silver said.\n\n\u201cHowever, the NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Morey tweeted but quickly deleted a tweet that read \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,\u201d a message of support for pro-Democracy protests that have swelled over the summer. In response, the Chinese Basketball Association announced it would sever ties with the Rockets, as did Tencent, the NBA\u2019s rights holder in China, and the Rockets\u2019 Chinese sponsors. On Monday, the league issued a statement in which it said it recognized that Morey\u2019s comments \u201cdeeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable,\u201d drawing fire in the United States for appearing to put the league\u2019s economic interests in China \u2014 the NBA\u2019s most recent five-year television rights extension with Tencent was reportedly worth $1.5 billion \u2014 ahead of the rights of its players and executives to speak freely about human-rights issues.\n\n[The NBA\u2019s China-Daryl Morey backlash, explained]\n\nSilver\u2019s statement Tuesday was an attempt to rebut that notion.\n\n\u201cBut for those who question our motivation, this is about far more than growing our business,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter Silver issued his statement on Tuesday, the sports arm of Chinese state broadcaster CCTV announced it would not broadcast the NBA\u2019s preseason games being played in China this week.\n\n\u201cWe believe any remarks that challenge national sovereignty and social stability do not belong to the category of free speech,\u201d CCTV said in a statement.\n\nSilver told reporters in Tokyo on Tuesday that he anticipated such a fallout in China.\n\n\u201cI do know there are consequences from freedom of speech; we will have to live with those consequences,\u201d he said.\n\nAdam Silver says he wants to be clear that \"We are not apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of expression,\" but that he does regret \"that so many people are upset, including millions and millions of our fans.\" pic.twitter.com/7R1JCanlbS \u2014 NBA Buckets (@NBA_Buckets) October 8, 2019\n\nGolden State Warriors Coach Steve Kerr, one of the NBA\u2019s most outspoken voices on the subject of human rights, said Monday night that he was not prepared to comment on the China issue because he had not studied it enough.\n\n[Jenkins: Don\u2019t be mad at the NBA.

So I try to keep my comments to those things. \u2026 It\u2019s more that I\u2019m just trying to learn. My brother-in-law is actually a Chinese history professor and I emailed him today to tell me what I should be learning about all this and what\u2019s happening, so I\u2019m just trying to learn just like everybody else.\u201d\n\nKerr added that no one from the league or the franchise had ordered him or his players not to comment on the issue.\n\nSilver also announced Tuesday that he plans to meet with Chinese basketball legend Yao Ming, now the chairman of the Chinese Basketball Association.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping together Yao and I can find an accommodation, but he is extremely hot at the moment and I understand it,\u201d Silver said.\n\nRead more NBA coverage:\n\nWhat\u2019s happening in Hong Kong?
