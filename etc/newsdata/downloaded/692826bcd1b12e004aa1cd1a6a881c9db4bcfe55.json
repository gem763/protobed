Over the weekend, the Wall Street Journal added that Trump had pressured the Ukrainian president to look into Biden\u2019s son at least eight times on one phone call.\n\n\u201cEight times makes it seem like a pretty obvious crime,\u201d Meyers observed. \u201cIt\u2019s like if you went on trial for stabbing a guy and said it was an accident \u2013 \u2018He fell on the knife\u2019 \u2013 and they said: eight times? \u2018Yeah, he was wearing roller skates.\u2019\u201d\n\nStephen Colbert: 'Thank God Trump never keeps his promises' Read more\n\nSince the \u201ceight times\u201d news broke on Friday, Trump has offered the full array of explanations, excuses, and deflections, often contradicting himself or Giuliani, who made the cable news circuit. Basically, said Meyers, Trump veered from \u201c\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter what I discuss,\u2019 to \u2018I don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u2019 to \u2018We talked about Biden,\u2019 to \u2018It was a perfect conversation,\u2019 to \u2018If I did talk about Biden, I\u2019d have the right to talk about Biden,\u2019 to \u2018I didn\u2019t pressure anyone.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn conclusion, \u201cthe president of the United States allegedly used his power to extort a foreign leader to meddle in the 2020 election on his behalf,\u201d said Meyers. \u201cIf this isn\u2019t impeachable behavior, I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d\n\nJimmy Kimmel: \u2018Like when Mike Tyson bit Holyfield\u2019s ear\u2019\n\nIn Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel also discussed the developing Trump-Ukraine bombshell, beginning with the phone call that prompted the whistleblower complaint. Trump made that call on 25 July, Kimmel noted \u2013 just a day after the conclusion of the Mueller testimonies on his report, which investigated whether Trump colluded with the Russian government in the 2016 election.\n\nIn other words, \u201ca day after the conclusion of a major investigation into whether he got help in the election from a foreign leader, he gets on the phone and asks for help from another foreign leader,\u201d said Kimmel. \u201cThe only thing I can compare it to is when Mike Tyson bit Evander Holyfield\u2019s ear \u2026 and then bit Evander Holyfield\u2019s other ear.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cbigly question\u201d now, Kimmel continued, is whether Trump used America\u2019s routine financial aid to Ukraine as a bargaining chip for gaining information on his chief political rival\u2019s son. Trump, of course, has maintained that his conversation with the Ukrainian president was unassailable. \u201cI said absolutely nothing wrong, it was perfect,\u201d he told reporters on camera over the weekend. \u201cIt was a perfect call.\u201d\n\nKimmel was not convinced. \u201cThe bottom line is: it would appear the president of the United States has used his office to dig up dirt on an opponent,\u201d he said, \u201cand Democrats in Congress are now thinking very seriously about threatening to maybe consider almost doing something about it.\u201d\n\nThe Republicans, meanwhile, have mostly stayed quiet, relying on an argument which boils down to, as Kimmel said, \u201cnumber one: President Trump would never pressure a foreign government to get dirt on the Biden family, and number two: of course he did! Everybody does that \u2013 it\u2019s politics.\u201d", "description": "Late-night hosts discussed Trump\u2019s phone call that prompted a whistleblower complaint and renewed calls for impeachment", "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5079846d8d32855ff01eedaea33fd427e2128cd/55_0_1593_956/master/1593.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=25a5484356668b40a47efadbf28dc0f1", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
