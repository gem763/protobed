Tomorrow, that question will be answered as genuine sporting history beckons for the John Gosden-trained favourite at Longchamp against the conflicting backdrop of high-rise Paris and the autumn hues of the Bois de Boulogne.\n\nThe five-year-old, partnered by Frankie Dettori, will attempt to become the first horse to win Europe\u2019s all-age, end-of-season mile-and-a-half championship, the \u20ac5 million (\u00a34.45 million) Qatar Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe, for a third time.\n\nEvery year, almost without fail, when the experts get out their slide-rules in December, the Arc stands alone as officially the world\u2019s highest-quality race and to win tomorrow on its 99th anniversary, Enable will have to beat 11 rivals, coming out of stall nine. Although only one horse has won from that draw in 55 years, the one which did, if you are looking for an omen, was Urban Sea, Enable\u2019s paternal grand-dam, in 1993.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor once, it is not about the jockey, although victory would also give Dettori a record-extending seventh win in the race. \u201cI\u2019ve ridden some great hoses but her CV is incomparable to anything else I\u2019ve ridden,\u201d said Dettori, 48, who has arguably been riding better this year than at any stage of his career.\n\nFrankie Dettori celebrates winning the 2017 edition of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe with Enable Credit: GETTY IMAGES\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s taken me to places no other horse has taken me. I love her, of course I love her. She\u2019s been a part of my life for three years.\u201d\n\nIf keeping a racehorse sound, fit and able is one thing, keeping it focused on the game is quite another and it is a measure of Enable\u2019s fortitude of mind that, of the eight horses to have won the Arc twice, only Treve (2013, 2014) even attempted a third victory.\n\nDespite being evens favourite, Treve came up 2\u00bc lengths short in fourth, beaten by a three-year-old colt \u2013 Golden Horn, which was trained by Gosden \u2013 and it is that experience that makes Gosden wary of this year\u2019s three-year-olds, the Irish colt Japan and the French Sottsass.\n\n\u201cThe great old trainers will tell you that Flat thoroughbred horses peak at five,\u201d explained Gosden as he supervised racing\u2019s latest box-office star in preparation for the moment of truth.\n\n\u201cThey are still finally getting all their teeth at four. To that extent, she is now the fully matured athlete. Of course, they have to continue loving and enjoying their training, which she does, she really enjoys it. She finds it a pleasure, not a chore.\u201d\n\nKeeping male horses focused at five is a different problem, he acknowledged. \u201cThat drug testosterone \u2013 it\u2019s the most dangerous in the world. We\u2019ve lost a few friends to that!\u201d Gosden added, laughing.\n\n\u201cBut when they really enjoy their racing like she does, the great mares get into that zone and it\u2019s where they want to be. At this time of year when everything hormonally has settled down \u2013 it can be difficult in the spring for obvious reasons \u2013 it\u2019s fine.\n\nEnable in the familiar surroundings of the Newmarket gallops Credit: GETTY IMAGES\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of older male horses. Take Stradivarius [the two-time Ascot Gold Cup winner] for example; he shouts and screams and roars, so you can have the combination of both but sometimes they say, \u2018Sorry, I\u2019ve had enough\u2019 or \u2018I want to sire a lot of stock\u2019 but it doesn\u2019t happen to a filly like this.\u201d\n\nWhen the then tall, unfurnished filly arrived at Gosden\u2019s yard, her conformation was dominated by her deep girth and big rib cage.\n\n\u201cWhen you get that sort of cardiovascular system plus the lung capacity, the lovely long stride and the graceful movement, and combine her mental attributes with her physiology, then you get a great athlete.\n\n\u201cThere are other essentials, and gate speed is another. It was her speed away from the start when the race was run at Chantilly [in 2017] that allowed Frankie to get her from stall 17 to one off the rail after a couple of furlongs.\u201d\n\nUnaffected by ground conditions; able to race from the front or from behind \u2013 a versatility not shared by all champion horses; experience \u2013 13 wins (including 10 Group Ones) from 14 starts \u2013 has also brought another element to Enable\u2019s racing.\n\n\u201cWith experience, she has learned to reserve her energies more than she did when she was younger, so she has been able to win three Group Ones [Eclipse, King George and Yorkshire Oaks] this season under hands and heels with just one flick of the whip,\u201d Gosden pointed out.\n\nHe insists she is in better form than when she was all out to beat Sea of Class a short neck 12 months ago after a difficult year. \u201cLast year she had surgery, came back at Kempton, got sick so unfortunately came to the Arc short of the preparation I wanted to give her,\u201d he explained.\n\nDettori describes Enable as having 'taken me to places no other horse has taken me' Credit: GETTY IMAGES\n\n\u201cBut, unfortunately, they wouldn\u2019t move the Arc back a week. But she was very determined and Frankie picked her up and carried her over the line.\u201d\n\nBesides Japan and Sottsass, Gosden sees the \u201crelentless galloper\u201d Ghaiyyath as another threat, while he gave a favourable mention to the \u201cunderestimated\u201d Waldgeist if the ground is on the fast side.\n\n\u201cThere will be no hiding place, we know that. She needs to be at the top of her game. I see a very solid pace, I don\u2019t think it will be one of those cagey races we\u2019ve seen before where they collect up and ping down the straight.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to do something that has never been done before. We hope it works out. It probably won\u2019t. There will be nerves but you\u2019d better control them. Jumping about like a raving lunatic is no good to anyone. It\u2019s a big thing but we\u2019re trying to keep composed.\u201d\n\nEnable\u2019s owner-breeder, the Saudi prince, Khalid Abdullah, will decide after the race whether she retires to stud or has one more run at Ascot in a fortnight\u2019s time. For him, it is further proof that, pound for pound, his Juddmonte Stud is the best in the world, having also bred Frankel.\n\nIf Enable wins tomorrow, she can count herself his equal.", "description": "Newmarket has been the centre of the racing world for the thick end of four centuries and for much of that time horses have been pounding up the wide expanses of Warren Hill.
