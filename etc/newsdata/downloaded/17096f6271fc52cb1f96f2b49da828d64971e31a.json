Curry was done for the night.\n\nHe finished with 40 points -- in 25 minutes -- on 14-of-19 shooting from the field, including 6-of-9 from deep and 6-of-6 from the line. He added six assists, six rebounds, two steals and a block. He was plus-18.\n\nCurry was atrocious in one area: turnovers. He committed five, including a couple so reckless he slapped his own temples almost immediately, suggesting getting in sync with his teammates is a work in progress and will be for a while.\n\nTriplets might be small, but they can score\n\nStory continues\n\nI asked Steve Kerr on Tuesday if he might use a lineup in which D'Angelo Russell and Jordan Poole both join Curry.\n\n\"We'd be extremely small, and we'd be vulnerable defensively,\" he said. \"But we'd be pretty explosive offensively. So, I have no idea. We'll see.\"\n\nWe saw. The three guards, none taller than 6-foot-5, shared the court with Draymond Green and Marquese Chriss. That quintet played the final 3:12 of the first half and outscored Minnesota 12-11 over that span.\n\nThe trio combined for all 12 of those points, with Curry scoring seven points, Russell three and Poole two. The Timberwolves managed two field goals during that same stretch.\n\nWith Curry and Russell (16 points) as proven scorers, and Poole (19 points) looking as he'll be fine on offense, there is a good chance we'll see more of that lineup.\n\nGlenn Robinson III takes his turn\n\nThe Warriors' search for a starter at small forward began with Alfonzo McKinnie in the preseason opener and moved on to Glenn Robinson III against the Timberwolves.\n\nThis doesn't mean McKinnie is out of the competition. Rather, it indicates coach Kerr is giving both men a chance. Alec Burks, the third candidate, also will get an opportunity, assuming he heals from a sprained right ankle sustained in practice last week.\n\nRobinson did OK, scoring 13 points on 6-of-11 shooting, including 1-of-2 from deep. He added four rebounds and two assists. Playing 20 minutes, he looked confident and decisive in his movements on offense, though less so on defense.\n\nIf you're looking for a highlight, he provided one in the fourth quarter. Robinson anticipated a Noah Vonleh passed near midcourt, swiping it and racing in for a dunk that fired up the crowd and prompted a Minnesota timeout.\n\nWarriors takeaways: What we learned from 143-123 win over Timberwolves originally appeared on NBC Sports Bay Area", "description": "Steph Curry scored 40 points and the Warriors blew out the T-Wolves by 20 points in their second preseason game.", "authors": ["Monte Poole"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/aB7c0d1mLWf7bejtzos2iA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SLAYKp7hWfu6pZTntf8QRA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnbayarea.com/7d179e45ee3c2803205f66fcf8c255a9", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
