But the Scottish judges disagreed, saying it was motivated by the \"improper purpose of stymying Parliament.\"\n\n\"This was an egregious case of a clear failure to comply with generally accepted standards of behaviour of public authorities,\" ruled one of the judges, Lord Brodie, according to a summary of the decision posted online.\n\nThe court did not immediately issue an order to lift the suspension -- also known as prorogation -- noting that the High Court in London had come to a different conclusion and that the UK Supreme Court would need to resolve the issue. The government confirmed that it would appeal the Scottish court's decision to the Supreme Court.\n\nA protester holds a placard at the gates of Downing Street during a demonstration against the UK Government's decision to prorogue parliament.\n\nJoanna Cherry, a member of Parliament for the Scottish National Party, who was the lead petitioner in the cross-party group of politicians which brought the action, said the decision was a \"historic ruling.\"\n\nDominic Grieve, who was attorney general in the government of former Prime Minister Theresa May, said if it was established that Johnson had misled the Queen, he would have to resign.\"If that were to to be the case that this had happened, Boris Johnson would find himself in an untenable position in Parliament,\" he told the BBC.\n\nAdvice to the Queen ruled unlawful\n\nIn their unexpected ruling on Wednesday, the Scottish judges overturned an earlier decision that the courts did not have the power to interfere in the Prime Minister's political decision to prorogue parliament.\n\nJUST WATCHED Why Boris Johnson wants to suspend Parliament Replay More Videos ...
