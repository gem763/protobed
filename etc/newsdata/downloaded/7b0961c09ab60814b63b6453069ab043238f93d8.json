As The Fix\u2019s Eugene Scott wrote, Trump\u2019s Sunday tweet quoting a Fox guest who said impeachment would create a \u201cCivil War like fracture\u201d in the country was a significant escalation of that tendency. By Tuesday, Trump had called the inquiry a \u201ccoup\u201d on Twitter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs I learn more and more each day, I am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP, intended to take away the Power of the.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2019\n\nOn his favorite network, the term \u201ccoup\u201d has been used with increased frequency. An analysis by the Fix found that Fox News has aired segments of hosts and guests calling the impeachment inquiry of Trump an attempted \u201ccoup\u201d each of the 11 days since Pelosi\u2019s announcement.\n\nYou can watch repeated examples of this in the video above, including by:\n\nFox News host Tucker Carlson\n\nFox News host Mark Levin\n\nFox News host Jesse Watters\n\nJudicial Watch President Tom Fitton\n\nFox News correspondent Geraldo Rivera\n\nFormer House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.)\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.)\n\nFox Business Network host Lou Dobbs\n\nFox Business Network host Maria Bartiromo\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany\n\nFox Business Network host Trish Regan\n\nFormer U.S. attorney Joe diGenova\n\nTrump campaign advisory board member Jenna Ellis Rives\n\nConservative radio host Lars Larson\n\nFox hosts and guests made seven references to a \u201ccoup\u201d over the first six days after Pelosi\u2019s announcement, according to closed-captioning records reviewed by the Fix. Since then, Fox personalities have referred to the inquiry as a \u201ccoup\u201d at least a dozen times, echoing talking points used by White House and Republican National Committee officials.\n\nAD\n\nNote that at least three of those Fox guests \u2014 McDaniel, McEnany and Ellis Rives \u2014 hold jobs that would indicate this is an official line of the campaign.\n\nAD\n\nAs the Fix reported in May, Trump\u2019s affinity for Fox is well-documented: He live-tweets Fox segments, hires Fox personalities for his administration, dials Fox anchors into White House meetings, uses Fox interviews to kick off his rallies and repeatedly leans on Fox personalities for uncritical interviews.\n\nMany congressional Republicans have remained silent in the wake of Trump\u2019s call for foreign election interference, and some have suggested that there is nothing wrong with it. His closest allies have also engaged in the \u201ccoup\u201d talk.\n\nAD\n\nThe GOP\u2019s overall silence can probably at least partially be attributed to pressure applied on Republican lawmakers by pro-Trump personalities on Fox and conservative talk radio.\n\nThe Fox coup d\u2019\u00e9tat hyperbole is also not new. At least nine Fox hosts and guests said former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III was part of a coup to overthrow Trump.\n\nSix months after that purported \u201ccoup\u201d ended, Trump was still in office.\n\nAD", "description": "As the House continues its impeachment inquiry of President Trump, the characterization of the inquiry as a \u201ccoup\u201d has ramped up on Fox News.", "authors": ["Jm Rieger", "Video Editor For The Fix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/sZ9hmSye56RmTt9ICF3_BxVEsSU=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-04-2019/t_a47530baffd84ca1b2b5be2c22d4d52a_name_20191003_FOX_COUP_V2.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
