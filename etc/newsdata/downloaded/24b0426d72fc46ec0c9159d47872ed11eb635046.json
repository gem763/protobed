The Really Online Lefty League/Facebook via REUTERS.\n\nFacebook Inc (FB.O) has come under fire in recent weeks over its decision to not fact-check ads run by politicians. The new ad comes days after Green New Deal champion Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez grilled Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on whether his site would allow such an ad.\n\n\u201cCould I run ads targeting Republicans in primaries saying that they voted for the Green New Deal?,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez asked the tech executive at a congressional hearing on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cCongresswoman, I don\u2019t know the answer to that off the top of my head,\u201d Zuckerberg replied. \u201cI think probably.\u201d\n\nFacebook has drawn criticism over its ad policy from Democratic candidates running in the 2020 presidential election such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren.\n\nLast week, Zuckerberg said Facebook did not want to stifle political expression.\n\nFacebook spokesman Tom Channick said that since the new ad came from a political action group, rather than a politician, it was eligible for review by the company\u2019s third-party fact-checking partners.\n\n\u201cWe have sent it to them for review,\u201d Channick told Reuters, adding that the ad would be removed if found to be false.\n\nThe new ad cycles through archive footage of Republicans such as former Presidents Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon before splicing together two real videos of Graham to make it look as if he said, \u201cWe believe in the Green New Deal.\u201d It also mentions the false endorsement in the ad text.\n\nSenator Graham\u2019s office said it was aware of the ad and confirmed the senator opposes the Green New Deal, a proposal championed by Ocasio-Cortez that would eliminate U.S. greenhouse gas emissions within a decade.\n\nGraham has previously called the proposal a \u201cdisaster\u201d and said it would \u201cdestroy the American economy.\u201d\n\nAdriel Hampton, treasurer of the group behind the ad, The Really Online Lefty League, said he came up with the idea to draw attention to the problems around false claims in online political advertising. He has spent $50 to show the ad online.\n\n\u201cThere appears to be little to nothing to stop serious election manipulation through false advertising, and that\u2019s bad for our democracy,\u201d Hampton said in an email to Reuters.\n\nAhead of the November 2020 election, lawmakers have also expressed concerns over the spread of misinformation through manipulated video, particularly deepfakes, which use machine learning to create realistic content where a person appears to say or do something they did not.\n\nThe video of Graham was manually edited, Hampton said. \u201cNo deepfakes needed,\u201d he said. \u201cVery low-budget, very easy to do.\u201d\n\nHe said that he intended the false claim to be obvious to spot by including the claim that Graham endorsed the Green New Deal in the ad\u2019s text.\n\n\u201cWhile a lot of people think our ad is funny, we\u2019ve seen a lot of folks taking it at face value, and THAT is alarming,\u201d he added.", "description": "A left-leaning political group is challenging Facebook's policy not to fact-check some political ads by running a spot that falsely claims Republican Senator Lindsey Graham has endorsed the Green New Deal, a plan by prominent Democrats.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Culliford", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1445019767&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O1UR", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
