Stand With Hong Kong\". The post has since been removed and team owner Tilman Fertitta went on Twitter to distance the team from the statement.\n\n\"Daryl Morey does not speak for the Houston Rockets,\" he said on Saturday. \"Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the NBA internationally and we are not a political organization.\"\n\nThe Rockets, currently playing games in Japan, could not be reached for comment outside of business hours.\n\nThe business' announcements follow one earlier in the day from the Chinese Basketball Association which said it was suspending \"exchanges and cooperation\" with the Houston Rockets.\n\nIn a statement posted on Weibo, the association, chaired by Yao, said it opposed Morey's comment, which it called inappropriate.\n\n\"Houston Rockets General Manager Morey publicly made an inappropriate comment related to Hong Kong,\" it said. \"The Chinese Basketball Association strongly opposes this and will suspend exchanges and cooperation.\"\n\nIt did not detail the nature of the cooperation or how long the suspension would last.\n\nReuters' telephone calls to the association to seek comment went unanswered.\n\nBasketball fans in China voiced criticism of the Rockets on Weibo.\n\n\"I watched the Rockets for 21 years, but I'm still a Chinese person first and foremost,\" said one user in response to the basketball association's announcement.\n\nAnother said: \"We Chinese basketball fans call on either Morey to apologize or the Rockets to fire Morey. If this doesn't happen, then we call on fans to boycott watching Rockets games.\"\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "The Houston Rockets' Chinese sponsor and a Chinese sportswear maker have suspended work with the basketball team after its general manager sent a tweet in support of Hong Kong protests over the weekend.
