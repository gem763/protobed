The foreign minister insisted that Ankara will stick to the plan, which Turkey calls \u201cOperation Peace Spring,\u201d and that it had only agreed to a \u201cpause\u201d in bombing Kurdish territory to allow the Syrian Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG/YPJ), a formerly U.S.-allied anti-jihadist militia, to leave the region. Cavusoglu also said the Kurds agreed to significant disarmament.\n\nTurkey is cooperating with the Free Syrian Army (FSA), a broad umbrella group of militias, some with ties to al-Qaeda, that arose to overthrow Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. Assad is not a part of the ceasefire deal and announced he would use \u201call legitimate means\u201d to expel Turkey from Syria.\n\nThe YPG accepted Assad\u2019s military aid this week against Turkey, welcoming Syrian Arab Army troops into Rojava to protect the indigenous Kurdish populations from Turkey and the FSA.\n\nAssad threatened Turkey with \u201call available legitimate means\u201d to destroy its military. Assad was not a part of the ceasefire agreement brokered Thursday.\n\nCavusoglu\u2019s remarks closely followed the announcement of a ceasefire by Vice President Mike Pence in Turkey after an hours-long meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\n\u201cTurkey will end the operation in northern Syria only after YPG/PKK terrorists leave [the safe zone],\u201d Cavusoglu said on Thursday, according to the Turkish state-run Anadolu news agency. Anadolu emphasized Cavusoglu\u2019s point that the ceasefire was \u201cnot a ceasefire.\u201d\n\nA ceasefire is defined as \u201ca military order to cease firing\u201d or \u201ca suspension of active hostilities.\u201d\n\nErdogan told reporters Friday that any military hostilities in the \u201csafe zone\u201d that the non-ceasefire covered were \u201cout of the question\u201d and that any claims the Turkish military was still attacking the YPG were \u201cdisinformation.\u201d\n\nAccording to Pence, the Turks agreed to a deal that would give the YPG 120 hours, or five days, to withdraw from the area of Rojava that the Turks wish to use as a \u201csafe zone\u201d for Arab refugees. In return, Turkey promised not to bomb civilian strongholds or expel native Kurdish populations and cease hostilities against the YPG.\n\nDespite the ceasefire fitting the definition of the word \u201cceasefire,\u201d Cavusoglu insisted the ceasefire was not a ceasefire because the YPG was not \u201clegitimate.\u201d\n\nThe YPG and its all-female counterpart, the YPJ, are the official militias of the Syrian Kurdish people. They form the backbone of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an umbrella organization that also included other ethnic minority fighters. The SDF was allied with the United States before the Turkish invasion last week and is considered largely responsible for the defeat of the Islamic State in Raqqa, the caliphate\u2019s \u201ccapital.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we pause the operation, the U.S. will stop the sanctions attempts, and we can only end the operation after the previous conditions have been met,\u201d Cavusoglu said. In a recent letter sent to Ankara, President Donald Trump said he would \u201cdestroy the Turkish economy\u201d if Erdogan continued threatening to destroy the Syrian Kurdish population.\n\nCavusoglu was adamant in saying \u201cOperation Peace Spring\u201d will not end until the refugees in Turkey are resettled in Kurdish territory.\n\nAnadolu reported that the ceasefire was part of a 13-point agreement between Turkey and the United States that \u201creaffirmed the relationship\u201d between the two NATO members, bound by treaty to use military power to defend each other if one is attacked. Three of the points pledge to affirm their stance as NATO allies and to \u201cuphold human life, human rights, and the protection of religious and ethnic communities.\u201d Other points included promises to fight the Islamic State, which Erdogan aided in flooding Syria with jihadists throughout 2014-2015; to respect the \u201cterritorial integrity of Syria,\u201d which is to say, not recognize Kurdistan as a state; and the \u201cpause\u201d of \u201cOperation Peace Spring.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish government agreed to end \u201cOperation Peace Spring\u201d entirely when the YPG presence in the \u201csafe zone,\u201d which lies in Syrian Kurdistan, is completely eliminated.\n\nThe Turkish military has killed seven civilians and injured more than 21 with military attacks in the less than 24 hours since the ceasefire announcement, according to Kurdish news outlet Rudaw.\n\n\u201cDespite the agreement to halt the fighting, air and artillery attacks continue to target the positions of fighters, civilian settlements and the hospital in Sari Kani. Turkey is violating the ceasefire agreement by continuing to attack the town since last night,\u201d SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali said on Friday.\n\nThe Kurdish report aligns with the outlandish statements of conquest in pro-Erdogan Turkish media, which have stoked Islamist nationalists into a frenzy against the United States. In a column on Thursday that referred to Washington as a \u201cpatron of terror,\u201d Ibrahim Karag\u00fcl, one of Erdogan\u2019s most popular supporters in the only media Erdogan legally allows to operate in the country, compared Erdogan to the legendary sultan Suleyman the Magnificent for challenging a U.S. ally.\n\nThe column \u2013 titled \u201cWe were in need of a leader like Selim the Grim, Suleyman the Magnificent. God bestowed him on Anatolia. You shouldn\u2019t have targeted Turkey. This was your gravest miscalculation. We are a nation that knows its friends and foes, and never forgets. Those telling us to \u2018halt\u2019 the Syria op are enemies; stopping now would be suicide\u201d \u2013 calls America \u201cthe global boss of terrorism\u201d and accused American history of being \u201crife with genocide.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe PKK is the U.S. \u2013 the U.S. is its boss.,\u201d Karag\u00fcl added, referring to a U.S.-designated Kurdish Marxist terrorist group the Turkish government considers indistinguishable from the YPG.\n\n\u201cEvery country opposing Turkey\u2019s fight against terrorism today, its self-defense efforts, is carrying out a covert war against Turkey. Every PKK attack is their attack,\u201d Karag\u00fcl concluded.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Turkish Foreign Minister\u00a0Mevlut Cavusoglu said the ceasefire brokered by America between Ankara and Syrian Kurdistan was \"not a ceasefire.\"", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Turkish-army-tank-toward-Syria-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
