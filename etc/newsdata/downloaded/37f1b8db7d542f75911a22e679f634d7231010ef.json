Eager to maintain my sleek cyclist silhouette, I started small with Patagonia\u2019s Black Hole Mini Hip Pack ($29, patagonia.com). The liter-size bag is sufficiently discreet that I often forget it\u2019s strapped around my waist. It takes creative maneuvering to wrest my phone from its compartment, but I can perform the feat with just one hand, allowing me to keep my bike steady.\n\nStarter Packs / Bags More Basic Than Chic\n\nClockwise from top left: Eddie Bauer Stowaway in gold, $20, eddiebauer.com; Patagonia Black Hole Mini Hip Pack in patchwork, $29, patagonia.com; Kavu Spectator in Milky Way, $25, kavu.com Photo: Clockwise from top: Eddie Bauer, Patagonia, Kavu\n\nEmily Harrington, a five-time U.S. National Sport Climbing champ, suggested I try the North Face \u201992 Rage \u2019Em fanny pack ($49, thenorthface.com), a classic design she uses during solo treks. It\u2019s made of 400D nylon and features water-bottle slots. \u201cThey\u2019re not cumbersome,\u201d she said of the packs. \u201cThey\u2019re basic and do exactly what you need.\u201d A similarly durable option: Baboon\u2019s multi-compartment pack ($55, baboontothemoon.com) with triple the capacity of the Patagonia or NorthFace, an alpine-grade nylon shell and a reinforced crossbody strap.\n\nI didn\u2019t need anything as hefty as the Baboon, so I turned next to Eddie Bauer\u2019s Stowaway Packable Waistpack ($20, eddiebauer.com). Admittedly, I first noticed the bag on Mandy Moore\u2019s otherwise fashionable Instagram, part of the reliable gear set the nearly century-old brand put together to outfit the actress\u2019s adventures to the peaks of Kilimanjaro and Everest. The Stowaway is now a fixture on my shorter local trips\u2014it fits all my necessities, and folds into itself for easy storage.\n\nMy more attractive backpacks have collected dust while I played Goldilocks during my fanny-pack search, and my back is oh-so-grateful. If I\u2019m a little less stylish, so be it. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m trekking to the Met Gala.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal is not compensated by retailers listed in its articles as outlets for products.
