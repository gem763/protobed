Others say it\u2019s convenient.", "language": "en", "text": "To millions of shoppers, the supermarket is just a place to stock up on produce and pantry staples to keep the family fed. But to others, especially children of immigrants who may already feel pushed to the margins of the American mainstream, the supermarket can be just another place to experience the sting of their outsider status.\n\nThe sting occurs whenever they walk down the \u201cethnic\u201d food aisle, the section of the supermarket that, to some, plays out like a remnant of the Jim Crow era, when laws established separate facilities for African Americans in the post-Reconstruction South. Sometimes known as the \u201cinternational\u201d food aisle, or even \u201cAsian\u201d and \u201cLatino\u201d aisles, these rows can come across to the shoppers they seemingly target as de facto segregation, another kind of \u201cseparate but equal\u201d policy that marginalized African Americans for generations.\n\n\u201cIf you go to the ethnic food aisle, that is sort of the last bastion of racism that you can see in full daylight in retail America,\u201d David Chang, the man at the helm of the Momofuku empire, said on his podcast this summer. \u201cIt is something that\u2019s got to go.\u201d\n\n[How David Chang defined the decade in food]\n\nIn a telephone interview, Chang says there is an \u201cinvisible ceiling\u201d on some supermarket items: Italian products that were once marginalized, such as olive oils and vinegars, are now routinely integrated into grocery store aisles, while Chinese, Japanese and Latino foods remain stuck in their own sections. The ongoing segregation of these foods, Chang says, isn\u2019t about acceptance among the mainstream. Asian and Latino cuisines have long been embraced by Americans of every stripe, he says. You can sometimes even see this acceptance play out in supermarkets: Instant ramen and tortilla soups may sit right next to boxes of chicken noodle and cream of chicken soups, those standards of mid-century America. Same for the produce section, where plantains and mangoes will be sold in the same area as apples and iceberg lettuce.\n\nYet in supermarkets there are still aisles dedicated to soy sauce, duck sauce, oyster sauce, rice vinegar, coconut milk, rice crackers, stir-fry sauces, yum yum sauce, curry paste, corn flours, adobo seasoning, bagged tortillas, refried beans, salsas and hundreds of other products connected, sometimes tenuously, to Asian and Latin American countries.\n\n\n\nThe international food aisle of a D.C. grocery store. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\n\u201cAll the foods in the ethnic food aisle are already accepted. So why do we even have them?\u201d Chang asks. The aisles, he adds, are an echo of \u201c1950s America, which was not a particularly good place to be, especially if you were Asian.\u201d\n\nTo Chang\u2019s way of thinking, these aisles continue to exist because nobody wants to talk about them, which was certainly true about the publicists I contacted for this story. Representatives of Whole Foods Market, Giant Food, Kroger, Albertsons (which includes Safeway stores) and Harris Teeter either declined to comment or did not return multiple phone calls for comment.\n\nPhil Lempert is not connected to any supermarket chain. He\u2019s the founder of supermarketguru.com, an independent source of food retail trends and industry analysis. He has also been the food trends editor for NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show since the early 1990s. He knows a lot about how supermarkets operate, past and present.\n\nGrocery stores began devoting shelf space to international products around the 1950s, Lempert says. The push came from independent distributors, known as rack jobbers, that specialized in foods then considered outside the American mainstream \u2014 Chinese, Jewish, Italian or of another origin \u2014 and were searching for places to sell them. Early on, rack jobbers would be responsible for their specific section of a store: They would stock the shelf, maintain its appearance and restock it as necessary.\n\n\u201cIt was the beginning of the store within a store, but this was a shelf within a shelf,\u201d Lempert says.\n\nNot all international food aisles are the same, experts say. They vary dramatically depending on the supermarket\u2019s location and the demographics of that neighborhood. Some aisles dedicated to Hispanic or Chinese products may not even be catering to shoppers from those cultures. The shelves packed with prepackaged stir-fry sauces and instant miso soups? They are not targeting cooks who know their way around a Chinese or Japanese kitchen. Ditto for those many jars of Old El Paso and Pace picante sauces. They are not meant for abuela\u2019s homemade tacos. These and countless other items are intended for white shoppers who want to dabble in international cuisines. Lempert compares these kind of white-focused international aisles to the new Impossible Whopper at Burger King. The mock-meat hamburger is not designed for vegans, he says. It\u2019s for flexitarians who want a break from meat.\n\n[Burger King\u2019s Impossible Whopper tastes even better than the real thing]\n\nFrom the beginning, however, the products from Goya Foods were intended for the Latin American market, says Joseph Perez, senior vice president of the Hispanic-owned company, which is based in New Jersey. Perez can attest to the racist underpinnings of the first \u201cethnic\u201d food aisles at supermarkets. As cities began to swell with immigrants from Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, major supermarkets started to take an interest in Goya products, which had mainly been relegated to bodegas and other small grocers, he says. But supermarket managers assigned Goya the shelves in the rear of the store, by the back exit or near the warehouse doors.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want the clientele in their stores,\u201d Perez says. Or at least in the part of the store trafficked by white shoppers. \u201cDavid Chang was not off the mark.\u201d\n\nWhatever their intentions, these international food aisles had an impact on Chang as he grew up in Northern Virginia. He remembers his parents shopping at two grocery stores \u2014 one that specialized in Korean foods, and the other a supermarket with \u201cethnic\u201d food aisles \u2014 and the memories were imprinted on his brain at an early age. The two stores, the separate aisles dedicated to international foods, his food: They were a reminder to an impressionable Chang that he was different from white America.\n\n\n\nThe Middle Eastern food aisle at a Wal-Mart in Dearborn, Mich. (Photo by Bill Pugliano/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cWe were always going to be different,\u201d Chang said he remembers thinking. \u201cWe were never going to be accepted.\u201d\n\nChang\u2019s take is by no means universal. Krishnendu Ray, a New York University associate professor of food studies and the author of \u201cThe Ethnic Restaurateur,\u201d says he is not bothered by international food aisles. A first-generation immigrant from the Indian state of Odisha, Ray doesn\u2019t find these aisles insulting, humiliating or even necessarily segregating. He mainly finds them intriguing. His interest, he acknowledges, is largely academic. He wants to see how the American mainstream packages and sells food designated as Indian or Mexican or some other international cuisine. But Ray says his perspective would probably be different if he, like Chang, were the child of immigrants. A child whose food was mocked by peers at school. A child who constantly tried to merge into the mainstream but encountered roadblocks.\n\n\u201cThe way I react to it would be very different from a second-generation American, a child of an immigrant,\u201d Ray says. \u201cI think that David\u2019s perspective is very attuned to the second-generation children of immigrants who have this sense of being identified, cornered, considered inferior.\u201d\n\nThose who own and operate grocery stores, or used to, say that international food aisles have nothing to do with segregation \u2014 and everything to do with sales and convenience.\n\nJay Rosengarten, co-founder of the Food Emporium chain, the first grocery stores to mix regular and specialty items on the same shelves, says that supermarkets in predominantly white neighborhoods operate more efficiently when they offer international products all in the same area. The rationale is simple, he notes: Customers don\u2019t want to search all over the supermarket \u2014 a massive space that can hold upward of 42,000 items \u2014 just for the handful of ingredients they might need to prepare, for example, Mexican enchiladas. They can pick up the tortillas, the seasoning blend and the salsa all in the same aisle.\n\nThese aisles don\u2019t have \u201canything to do with racism,\u201d Rosengarten says. \u201cIt has everything to do with the way people buy food. That\u2019s the way stores are organized.\u201d\n\nPlus, as Goya\u2019s Perez points out, absorbing international foods into the larger supermarket ecosystem can hurt the sales of those products. A few years ago, when William Rodriguez was building a new Billy\u2019s Market Place in Ridgewood, N.Y., he considered ditching the international food aisle and integrating the Latino, Chinese, Indian and other products into the standard supermarket shelves. But he was discouraged from doing so \u2014 by some of the very companies that supply these foods. In the past, supermarkets that attempted such integration saw their sales drop on international products, says Rodriguez, who is also president of the National Supermarket Association. Shoppers apparently buy more of the same foods when they are lumped together, which is good for both supermarket and supplier.\n\nInternational aisles are \u201cextremely profitable,\u201d adds Perez. \u201cIt generates more dollars per food [product] by having it consolidated.\u201d\n\nBut more to the point, Perez says, the battle for hearts and minds has already been won. Over the decades, supermarkets have expanded their stock of international foods. Items that, back in the 1960s and 1970s, occupied just a few shelves by the dock doors have multiplied many times over and now consume whole aisles. These foods generate foot traffic into supermarkets, which see the fringe benefit of sales in other departments. The increased visibility for these foods is a statement in itself, Perez says.\n\nAn aisle that, to David Chang, looks like an ugly remnant of segregation is, in fact, something else altogether, Perez says. It\u2019s a destination.\n\nRead more on Voraciously:\n\nCool, spiced Mexican horchata is the ultimate refresher for fall\n\nMerriam-Webster toasts an expanding food and drink vocabulary with a \u2018tallboy\u2019 and \u2018matcha\u2019\n\nAs the Impossible and Beyond burgers take off, will real veggie burgers go extinct?", "description": "Chang says dedicating a particular supermarket aisle to international foods is segregation.", "authors": ["Tim Carman", "Reporter Focusing On National Food Issues", "Critic Covering Affordable", "Under-The-Radar Restaurants In The D.C.
