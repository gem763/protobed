There will be no grey area for Los Pumas, for whom the minimum acceptable is reaching the quarter-finals.\n\nIn the past three tournaments, Argentina finished third (2007), lost in the quarter-finals to the eventual champions (2011) and fourth (2015).\n\nThe big game for the South American powerhouse will be the opening clash against France, as it could decide the fate of either team in Pool C. With England dangerously \u2013 that is for their opponents \u2013 peaking at exactly the right time, all indicators show that the game in Tokyo will decide the second qualifier from a pool that also comprises USA and Tonga, both of whom can rightly argue this is the Pool of Death.\n\nLos Pumas last won a game in August 2018, but when you constantly play the All Blacks, Springboks, Wallabies, and you arrive to the end-of-season tour operating on fumes, it is understandable that they are currently 11th in the World Rugby rankings.\n\nPreparation for Japan has been intense and although the team failed to win in the shortened Rugby Championship \u2013 coming painstakingly close against the All Blacks \u2013 they should benefit from the residual effect of a monumental Super Rugby season in which Jaguares reached their first final among the best teams the southern hemisphere can offer. They provide 26 of Argentina\u2019s squad of 31.\n\nThere are a few differences with that team, namely the pivotal role of No 10 where Nicol\u00e1s S\u00e1nchez has been brought back from Stade Fran\u00e7ais. He is one of three players selected based overseas, overturning an internal regulation stating that players not in the country wouldn\u2019t be selected for national honours.\n\nSaracens\u2019 Juan Figallo, after a couple of injury-marred seasons with the London club, is fit and raring to go. The second fly-half is the bolter in the squad. Castres\u2019 Benjam\u00edn Urdapilleta, who had last played for Los Pumas in 2013, became one of the top performers in French rugby, and was selected on the back of 40 minutes of Test rugby in two games against the Springboks.\n\nSince taking the head coach\u2019s role 13 months ago, Ledesma has mapped the road to Japan, to ensure they peak against France. As a four-time player at a World Cup, and a Wallabies assistant coach four years ago, Ledesma is well aware of how to prepare his team to be ready.\n\n\u201cWe spoke about setting goals,\u201d says Ledesma. \u201cNeuroscience says that you have 80% more chances of reaching a goal by setting it, visualising it and working every day towards it. Obviously, the first goal is reaching the quarter-finals. In an open World Cup, after quarters anything can happen, and it will come down to us.\u201d\n\nHe concludes: \u201cThese players have prepared all year to be world champions. We must dream big and set the goals that will take us there.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Frankie Deges is media manager for South America Rugby", "description": "Mario Ledesma\u2019s side hope to peak at just the right time but they\u2019ll have to hit the ground running", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10cd84f47aa05a5c4ea20f9bf7e6bb1db724329f/0_0_500_300/master/500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dc63f89e0469900f717d4dcf3202aa48", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
