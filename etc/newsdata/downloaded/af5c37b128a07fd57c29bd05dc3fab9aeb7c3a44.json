That's because between the two of us, we managed to make almost as much as we spent, about $35,000.\n\nNow we're in our eighth month of living out of suitcases, and we've slowed down \u2014 we're back in the states while my husband is renovating my family's vacation home in Maine. No longer having to pay for our accommodations, we're actually in the positive, having earned more than what we spent on our travels.\n\nHow did we manage this? By setting and (mostly) sticking to a budget, finding remote freelance work (averaging six hours a week), signing up for a foreign-transaction-fee-free travel rewards card, walking an average of 10,000 steps a day \u2014 often replacing paid transportation \u2014 taking long-distance buses instead of planes, filtering water instead of buying it, doing laundry by hand, dining in, and eating out where the locals frequent, among other penny-stretching strategies. And it has helped that our baby's flights, accommodations, and fares for excursions and attractions have almost always been free.\n\nThe full-time remote working life is a goal for many \u2014 being able to set your own schedule, get the job done from anywhere in the world, and sightsee after hours. Others may aspire to become social media travel influencers and get paid to post from all over the globe.\n\nNeither was our dream or reality. I didn't plan on working. Instead, I had the luck of receiving a sizeable project from an existing client right before we left the US, and that gave me the courage to grow my freelance list from one client to 14 throughout our travels in the areas I specialize in: writing, social media, and marketing. Each remote freelance situation has been unique \u2014 some have paid me per writing assignment, while others paid me monthly retainers for a specific scope of marketing or social media work.\n\nSaving for and calculating our world travel budget: How accurate were we?\n\nHow we saved for this trip is a longer story, but in short, over the course of two years, my husband and I set and stuck to a monthly savings goal, adding to our travel fund each month and keeping daily expenses down by rarely eating out, living in a one-car household (a rarity in LA) and one-bedroom apartment, and biking to work (and most other places) every day.\n\nTo come up with our $36,000 budget, we consulted travel blogs and Budget Your Trip, which provides the average daily cost per \"budget,\" \"mid-range,\" and \"luxury\" traveler.\n\nSince we didn't plan to stay in shared accommodations or hitchhike like backpackers might, we figured we should double the mid-range estimate. Looking back, we should have factored our child as at least one-fourth or one-half of one adult's daily costs. For example, for Peru, Budget Your Trip estimates one person on a mid-range budget will spend $46 per day, whereas our daily spend was $106. The cost of diapers, wipes, and whole milk added up.\n\nWhat we actually spent while traveling\n\nAfter six months of travel in South America, our average daily spend came to around $110. Broken down by category, it looked like this:\n\nAccommodations: $40\n\n$40 Food: $29\n\n$29 Short-distance transportation (cabs, local public transportation, etc.): $13\n\n$13 Attractions: $20\n\n$20 Other: $8\n\nWhile traveling in El Salvador and the US, we've mostly stayed for free with family and friends, borrowed cars, and cooked meals at home, bringing our daily budget down to $30 to $50, depending on the amount of sight-seeing and longer-distance travel.\n\nOf course, our average daily costs only tell half the story. Planes, trains, and long bus rides added up to about $14,000, including some unusual detours, like flying to the US to help my mom after an unplanned surgery and to Cabo for a friend's bachelorette. If I were to do this again, figuring out how to cut back on longer-distance travel costs would be my main priority. The final category of spending we budgeted for was monthly recurring costs: travel health insurance and our two phone bills, which added up to about $200 per month.", "description": "Mary Kearl and her husband had saved up $36,000 to travel through Central and South America, but because they freelanced they barely used the money.", "authors": ["Mary Kearl"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d94b72178c0cd0656105c24?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
