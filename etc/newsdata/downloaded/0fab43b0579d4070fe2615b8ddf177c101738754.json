And with his Fu Manchu mustache, big glasses and red-shaded shoes, No. 68 certainly stood out before throwing a pitch, even to those who didn\u2019t know his backstory.\n\nThen, the Yankees geared up. Quickly, they drove Dobnak out of the game.\n\nDJ LeMahieu sliced a leadoff double against Dobnak, and things didn\u2019t improve much for the 24-year-old righty. He left with the bases loaded and no outs in the third inning, the start of a seven-run burst that made it 8-0.\n\nHis totals: two-plus innings, four runs on six hits and two walks without a strikeout. The Yankees didn\u2019t chase his pitches out of the strike zone and swatted what they could reach.\n\nDobnak, who hadn\u2019t pitched in 10 days, was a surprise choice over All-Star Jake Odorizzi (15-7, 3.51) to pitch a day after New York romped 10-4 in the opener. His success at inducing grounders at homer-friendly Yankee Stadium helped give him the nod.\n\nTwins manager Rocco Baldelli thought Dobnak\u2019s demeanor would help, too.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s about as unique a story as you\u2019re going to find, and in a way, probably that whole story and everything that goes along with it is probably what\u2019s made him who he is and what\u2019s allowed him to take this journey and find his way to the big leagues,\u201d Baldelli said.\n\nOdorizzi, who will start Game 3 Monday in the best-of-five series, said he spent a lot of time with Dobnak on Friday, talking about facing the Yankees lineup and pitching in the Bronx. The veteran righty, like most of the Twins, knew little about Dobnak when the newcomer began his rapid rise this year.\n\n\u201cI had no idea his history was so vivid and kind of well explored, if you will,\u201d he said.\n\nDobnak made his major league debut in August and keep excelling, going 2-1 with a 1.59 ERA in games, including five starts. Featuring a funky delivery, he struck out 23 and walked five in 28 1/3 innings.\n\nIt was a most unlikely ascent.\n\nUndrafted after playing at Division II Alderson Broaddus University in West Virginia, he decided to give himself a chance at pro ball by playing for the Utica Unicorns of the little, independent United Shore Professional Baseball League. He signed with the Twins in the summer of 2017 and spent last year in Class A.\n\nDobnak began this season in Class A, climbed to Double-A and Triple-A, and eventually got the call from Minnesota.\n\nAlong the way, his lore grew. Trying to earn extra money while in the minors, he took a different road.\n\nOn Twitter, he proudly mentions his 4.99/5 Uber driver rating. In fact, the daily press notes distributed by the Twins list other aspects of his off-the-field resume: Lyft driver and pizza delivery, among the way, more than two years ago, Dobnak and his future wife set the date for their wedding \u2014 Sept. 28, 2019. No way he imagined he\u2019d be pitching for the AL Central champs back then.\n\nDobnak, nonetheless, got permission from Baldelli to attend his own wedding. His veteran Twins teammates had a requirement, though \u2014 since he was going to miss on the rookie dress-up custom on the team\u2019s last flight, he had to wear the chosen costume. So Dobnak put on his purple Globo Gym outfit, right out of the \u201cDodgeball\u201d movie, for the commercial flight to his wedding.\n\nWhen Dobnak walked into the reception with 250 guests, he wore the same, oversized goggles he sported during the bubbly-soaked clubhouse celebration after Minnesota clinched the division crown earlier in the week. The maid of honor\u2019s speech ended with \u201cGo Twins!\u201d\n\nToo bad for Dobnak, there was no dodging the Yankees.\n\n___\n\nAP Baseball Writer Mike Fitzpatrick contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Just too much traffic for Twins rookie Randy Dobnak.
