But these encouraging trends should be interpreted with caution,\u201d Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.\n\n\u201cThe area is a very complex area, it\u2019s a very volatile area. We have made very significant progress, the number of cases have plummeted.\n\n\u201cBut if there is insecurity incidents, we may lose what we have gained so far.\u201d\n\nSince the most recent Ebola outbreak, a vaccine a developed by Merck Sharp and Dohme has been used on more than 230,000 people.\n\nOn Friday, the vaccine which has yet to be licensed, received a green light from The European Medicines Agency (EMA) in a step towards its commercialisation.\n\nA second experimental vaccine manufactured by the Belgian subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson is to be introduced in November, according to DR Congo medical officials.", "description": "Geneva (AFP) \u2013 The deadly Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) remains an \u201curgent\u201d global health emergency, The", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/43c6f9_dr-congo-latest-ebola-outbreak-has-killed-000-people-ebola-an-urgent-global-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
