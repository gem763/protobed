In fact, Debi, 58, and 66-year-old David are \u2018empty nesters\u2019 and the four adult children they share, aged between 19 and 37, are long gone.\n\nAt a time in their lives when, historically, many couples choose to downsize \u2014 and various organisations are putting pressure on more of them to do so \u2014 Debi and David have torn up the rulebook and gone big with their bricks and mortar.\n\nThey don\u2019t even have any grandchildren yet, nor are they expecting any imminently.\n\n\u2018Now we\u2019re not constrained by corporate life, dependent kids and mortgages, we\u2019re finally in a position to buy our dream home, so why should we downsize and live on top of each other in a poky flat just because we\u2019re getting older?\u2019 asks Debi, a photographer.\n\nShe met David, a retired procurement manager, six years ago after their respective marriages had ended.\n\nDebi makes a fair point, although it goes completely against the thinking of Saga, the organisation that campaigns for and safeguards the interests of the over-50s. It is lobbying the Government to introduce a one-off stamp duty-free move to encourage older homeowners to downsize in retirement.\n\nThe premise is that slashing moving costs for pensioners will help free up larger homes for those further down the ladder and thus stimulate the housing market. It would also release capital to see them through retirement (and possibly slip a few thousand to desperate children and grandchildren struggling to get on the housing ladder).\n\nPilates teacher Jackie Brealey, 60, and her husband Mick, 61, a motorcycle instructor. \u2018We put up with our old two-bedroom semi-detached bungalow with a tiny garden for ten years, but craved space both indoors and outdoors for living and entertaining,\u2019 says Jackie\n\nThe couple sold their home in Surrey, pictured, for \u00a3365,000 and moved to Hampshire\n\nCertainly, there is support for the idea. After all, when adult children have flown the nest, many retirees are left rattling around houses with far more rooms than they need. Plus, larger homes and gardens become more tiresome to manage in older age.\n\nYet, curiously, upsizing is a fast-growing trend. A recent report found that 46 per cent of homeowners aged 55 to 74 had spent extra money on their latest move. And 28 per cent of those had bought a bigger property with more bedrooms, despite many people in this age group living either alone or as a couple, found the study by the Cambridge Centre for Housing & Planning Research and the National House Building Council (NHBC) .\n\nDr Elle Boag, a senior lecturer in social psychology at Birmingham City University, says upsizing in later life can have a magical effect on both individual wellbeing and harmony within a marriage.\n\n\u2018For many over-50s, this will be the first time in their lives that they\u2019ve had the opportunity to buy the home they really want now their kids have grown up and they have more disposable income,\u2019 she explains.\n\n\u2018My husband and I downsized from a large five-bed to a three-bed when the children left home, but I\u2019m now upsizing again because I miss the space and luxuries such as en-suite bathrooms, a study each for my husband and me, a downstairs loo and the option to use a bedroom as a yoga room if I want to.\u2019\n\nShe adds: \u2018By the time they hit 50, many people start to question: \u201cWho am I saving all this money for?\u201d If your children are self-sufficient and you want to buy a bigger house, why shouldn\u2019t you? If you can afford to do it, upsizing is good for you, while downsizing can have a very negative impact on a relationship.\n\n\u2018If you\u2019ve been in a large house and you decide to downsize once the children have left home then, suddenly, you\u2019re going to be living in much closer proximity to your partner or spouse again, which can ruin relationships.\u2019\n\nDebi Ireland agrees. Not that her children have expressed resentment.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve served our time in much smaller properties during our respective marriages and latterly together for four years in Surrey, and have always put our children first,\u2019 she reflects. \u2018We were desperate to get away from the traffic and noise down there and move back up north, where we\u2019re both from, to a period cottage or barn with glorious views and oceans of space indoors and out.\n\n\u2018We decided that as soon as David retired in 2017, we\u2019d make the dream happen.\u2019\n\nHaving sold the mortgage-free house in Surrey for \u00a3660,000, they each added savings to top up the pot and paid cash for their barn.\n\n\u2018When David first showed me the brochure, I was worried the barn looked too isolated, mindful that, in older age, we need to be close to amenities and a community,\u2019 says Debi. \u2018But before the estate agent arrived to meet us, I\u2019d peered through the windows and fallen in love with it.\u2019\n\nSmall wonder, given that it has six bedrooms, three bathrooms, a spacious living room with brick inglenook fireplace, a large farmhouse kitchen, a family room and even a studio for Debi\u2019s photography. A farmer has promised to clear the lane of snow in the winter in return for his sheep grazing on four acres of Debi and David\u2019s land. They pay a local man with a sit-on mower to tackle the other acre.\n\n\u2018A few of my friends questioned whether upsizing was right at our age. But we\u2019ve worked hard all our lives, raised our children and now it\u2019s time for us,\u2019 says Debi.\n\n\u2018We both help our kids out as much as we can, because we recognise that it\u2019s difficult for the younger generation to get on the housing ladder these days. We want them to have the best lives they can \u2014 but we also want the same for ourselves.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s a similar tale for Pilates teacher Jackie Brealey, 60, and her husband Mick, 61, a motorcycle instructor. \u2018We put up with our old two-bedroom semi-detached bungalow with a tiny garden for ten years, but craved space both indoors and outdoors for living and entertaining,\u2019 says Jackie.\n\nShe and Mick have four children between them, aged 42, 38, 30 and 25, plus four grandchildren and another on the way. Three of the children own property, though none as big as their parents\u2019 home.\n\nThree years ago, the couple cashed in by selling their pricey, but tiny, mortgage-free property in Surrey for \u00a3365,000 and went house-hunting in Hampshire to get more for their money. Their lives and relationship have improved exponentially as a result.\n\n\u2018We fell in love with a detached Sixties house with spacious rooms, three large bedrooms, big windows and half an acre of garden and paid \u00a3440,000 for it, using savings and a chunk of my pension to remain mortgage-free,\u2019 says Jackie.\n\n\u2018Almost immediately, we added a large extension costing \u00a350,000 on the back of it, to create an open-plan living space.\u2019\n\nAnd they don\u2019t feel they have anything to apologise for: \u2018All our money is in the property now and, one way or another, it will all end up going to the kids, so it\u2019s hardly as if we\u2019ve blown their inheritance by upsizing.\n\n\u2018We helped out one of the children with a deposit for a home and help all of them financially in other ways. We don\u2019t feel guilty at all about upsizing now. The property is an investment for the future.\n\n\u2018Upsizing was a lifestyle choice for us. We love entertaining, but, if we invited even two friends over for dinner at our old house, it was a squeeze. Now, we throw parties all year round and have discovered that we both love gardening.\n\n\u2018Inside, even the third bedroom is so huge that it doubles as a Pilates studio if I teach from home, and we\u2019ve earmarked it for conversion to a \u201cgranny annexe\u201d if ever our elderly parents need to live with us.\n\n\u2018Friends and family were dubious about us upsizing and asked us: \u201cWhat the hell are you going to do with that huge garden?\u201d But we love it. We\u2019re not overlooked here, and Mick and I often sit in the garden with a cup of tea in the evenings and watch bats and shooting stars.\u2019\n\nHad it not been for them upsizing to a spacious four-bedroom home near Faversham, Kent, in October 2015, charity directors Margaret Lee-Roberts, 69, and her husband Trevor, 75, a retired project manager, wouldn\u2019t know the joy of having three of their six grandchildren to sleep over every Thursday.\n\nThey previously lived in a tiny three-bedroom home on the first and second floor above a ground-floor business premises.\n\n\u2018We raised our family in a large, four-bedroom Victorian house, but then downsized to our last home when we suddenly needed to live closer to my late father when he became ill. In hindsight, we bought in haste,\u2019 says Margaret.\n\nHad it not been for them upsizing to a spacious four-bedroom home near Faversham, Kent, in October 2015, charity directors Margaret Lee-Roberts, 69, and her husband Trevor, 75, a retired project manager, wouldn\u2019t know the joy of having three of their six grandchildren to sleep over every Thursday\n\nThe couple had previously lived on the top floor of this building\n\nShe and Trevor have three children, aged 45, 42 and 33. \u2018At \u00a3280,000, it was a bargain and, of course, it was a bonus to free up a bit of cash, but we didn\u2019t appreciate how cramped we\u2019d feel \u2014 and how much that would get to us.\n\n\u2018We had one daughter, her partner and a newborn living with us at the time, so the lack of space was impossible for all of us.\n\n\u2018We longed for something more spacious and useable.\u2019\n\nThey sold the property in late 2014 and upsized to their current home \u2014 a new-build four-bedroom house costing \u00a3340,000.\n\nAlthough classed as an end terrace, it was substantially larger than their old home, with four large double bedrooms, two bathrooms, an open-plan kitchen-diner and a large living room.\n\nMargaret says: \u2018We\u2019ve got masses of storage and a small garden, which is fine as we\u2019re not keen gardeners anyway. It\u2019s absolute bliss to have so much space after all those years feeling cooped up.\n\n\u2018We even have one room full of toys for when our daughter\u2019s three children come to stay on a Thursday while she works late as a psychology teacher.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a bus stop and a supermarket close by, so we can catch the bus into Canterbury if ever we reach the stage when we can\u2019t drive.\u2019\n\nShe adds: \u2018Pensioners are entitled to live as they choose, especially when they\u2019ve worked hard to own their properties. Many, like us, have lots of visitors to stay. My generation don\u2019t live very differently from younger generations.\n\n\u2018Why shouldn\u2019t you enjoy space at home at our age if you can afford it? We tried downsizing and it didn\u2019t work for us.\n\n\u2018This is our forever home \u2014 and we\u2019re never leaving.\u2019", "description": "Debi Ireland and her partner David paid \u00a3775,000 for this six-bedroom barn conversion in Lancashire's Ribble Valley in August having sold their old three-bedroom semi in Surrey.", "authors": ["Sadie Nicholas For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/21/20054526-0-image-a-25_1571776902536.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
