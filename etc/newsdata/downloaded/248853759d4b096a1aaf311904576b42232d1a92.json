We\u2019ve had presidents trying to cover up a sexual liaison with an intern and a botched burglary, but never have we had one who went to such lengths to cover up an inaccurate weather forecast. Alabama being hit by a hurricane? Friends, this is not rational behavior.\n\nTrump also cancelled a meeting with the Taliban at Camp David. The meeting was to have been secret. It was scheduled for the week of the anniversary of 9/11. He cancelled it by tweet.\n\nDoes any of this strike you as even remotely rational?\n\nBefore that, Trump cancelled a state visit to Denmark because Denmark wouldn\u2019t sell Greenland to the US. Hello? Greenland wasn\u2019t for sale. The US no longer buys populated countries. The state visit had been planned for months.\n\nHe has repeatedly told senior officials to explore using nuclear bombs to stop hurricanes hitting the US. He believes video games cause mass shootings. He thinks climate change is no big deal.\n\nNo president has ever been sent packing. Nixon resigned because he saw it coming. Trump would sooner start a civil war\n\nHe says trade wars are \u201cgood and easy to win\u201d. He insists it\u2019s Chinese rather than US consumers who pay his tariffs. He \u201corders\u201d American firms to stop doing business in China.\n\nHe calls the chairman of the Federal Reserve an \u201cenemy\u201d. He retweets a comedian\u2019s sick suggestion that the Clintons were responsible for the suicide of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nI think we have to face the truth that no one seems to want to admit. This is no longer a case of excessive narcissism or grandiosity. We\u2019re not simply dealing with an unusually large ego.\n\nThe president of the United States is seriously, frighteningly, dangerously nuts. And he\u2019s getting nuttier by the day.\n\nSuch a person in the Oval Office can do serious damage.\n\nWhat to do? We can vote him out of office in 14 months\u2019 time. But he could end the world in seven and a half seconds.\n\nThere\u2019s also the question of whether he\u2019ll willingly leave.\n\nWith rumors flying that Trump might exchange him for another lapdog, who knows? Maybe Pence will discover some cojones\n\nCan you imagine the lengths he will go to win? Will he get Russia to do more dirty work? Instruct the justice department to arrest his opponent? Issue an executive order banning anyone not born in the US from voting? Start another war?\n\nBy the time the courts order him to cease whatever unconstitutional effort he\u2019s making to remain in office, the election may be over. Or he\u2019ll just ignore the courts.\n\nIt\u2019s almost too late for an impeachment. Besides, no president has ever been sent packing. Nixon resigned because he saw it coming. Trump would sooner start a civil war.\n\nAlso, being coo-coo is not an impeachable offense.\n\nTwo Republicans who have announced primary challenges to him have suggested another possibility: the 25th amendment.\n\nFormer Massachusetts governor Bill Weld recently tweeted that Trump is \u201ca clear and present danger\u201d to the US, with the hashtag \u201c#25thAmendment\u201d. Former Illinois representative Joe Walsh says the amendment should be \u201clooked at\u201d because the president is \u201cnuts\u201d.\n\nPlay Video 1:07 Donald Trump blames lightbulbs for his orange hue \u2013 video\n\nLast February, former deputy director and acting director of the FBI Andrew McCabe said officials in the Department of Justice had discussed using the 25th.\n\nRatified in 1967, it allows the vice-president to become \u201cacting president\u201d when \u201cthe vice-president and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or such other body as Congress may by law provide\u201d declare a president incapacitated.\n\nThe only attribute Vice-President Mike Pence has displayed so far is sycophancy: most recent illustration, overnighting at Trump\u2019s golf resort in Ireland. But with rumors flying that Trump might exchange him for another lapdog, who knows? Maybe Pence will discover some cojones.\n\nAnother problem: the amendment doesn\u2019t define who \u201cprincipal officers\u201d are and the constitution never mentions the word \u201ccabinet\u201d. If Trump thought a revolt was brewing, he\u2019d fire everyone instantly.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t completely rule out the 25th amendment, but the only thing that\u2019s going to get Pence and a majority of Trump\u2019s lieutenants to pull the plug before Trump pulls it on them may be so horrific that the damage done to America and the world would be way beyond anything we\u2019ve experienced to date.\n\nWhich is to say, be careful what you wish for.\n\nPray that we make it through the next 14 months. Then do everything in your power to remove this man from office.", "description": "It is almost too late for impeachment. The 25th amendment is untested.
