In the report, two South African cities ranked higher in terms of property value growth than wealthier global counterparts Milan, Tokyo and Moscow.\n\nAt position 92 out of 150 cities is Cape Town, which saw property values grow by 3.9% last year, topping major cities that include Paris and New York.\n\nJohannesburg came in at number 109 with a steady 2.2% growth last year, which experts say is good, but still beneath the global 6.6% average, according to the 2017 Knight Frank Global Residential Cities Index. The index looks at the property markets of 150 cities to determine the average increase in property values over a 12-month period.\n\n\u201cThe lifestyle that Cape Town offers is exceptional and hard to beat for the sort of money you pay to live here,\u201d says Denise Dogon, chief executive officer (CEO) of Dogon Group Properties.\n\n\u201cWith the way it has developed in terms of restaurants and infrastructure, and all the awards it has won, the report doesn\u2019t surprise me. It\u2019s also one of the safer cities as crime is generally confined to certain areas.\u201d\n\nDurban\u2019s property rankings dropped into the bottom 10 worldwide with a negative growth of -5.1%, which Pam Golding CEO Andrew Golding says is an unfair generalisation. \u201cI think that Durban, like many of the cities on that list, has many pockets that are great performers, so to throw a blanket over a whole city isn\u2019t really a great indicator. But, in fairness, the Western Cape has been outperforming everywhere else, and in 2016, Joburg and Durban have certainly been lagging behind,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe reason is that Cape Town sees an above-normal migration of people owing to the perception of the lifestyle it offers. Another important factor is that it benefits the most from foreigners who invest there.\u201d\n\nBut all this might change after the recent economic downgrades. \u201cOur experience of what\u2019s happening in the market was [before the] downgrade. We haven\u2019t been able to assess the market yet, because March is a good month for the residential property industry and April is a slower month because of the holidays. By the end of May, we\u2019ll have a much better picture,\u201d Golding says.\n\nGolding says property investors now need to make wise choices. \u201cSmaller factors such as the street that you\u2019re on could make a significant difference in the value of your investment. There is an uptake in sectional-title properties and a trend towards inner-city living. Security demands are driving a section of the market significantly and first-time owners are getting older, which is drastically affecting the rental market.\u201d\n\nBEST-PERFORMING CITIES 2016\n\n1 Nanjing, China 41.1%\n\n2 Wuxi, China 35.7%\n\n3 Shanghai, China 31.7%\n\n4 Hangzhou, China 28.7%\n\n5 Zhengzhou, China 28.4%\n\n6 Beijing, China 28.1%\n\n7 Wuhan, China 25.5%\n\n8 Tianjin, China 25.4%\n\n9 Guangzhou, China 24.3%\n\n10 Wellington, New Zealand 23.7%\n\nWORST PERFORMING CITIES 2016\n\n140 Singapore -2.6%\n\n141 Naples, Italy -3.0%\n\n142 Perth, Australia -4.1%\n\n143 Palermo, Italy -4.5%\n\n144 Durban, South Africa -5.1%\n\n145 Genoa, Italy -6.2%\n\n146 Jaipur, India -6.3%\n\n147 Darwin, Australia -7.0%\n\n148 Aberdeen, UK -9.8%\n\n149 Sevilla, Spain -9.9%\n\n150 Moscow, Russia -15.0\n\nSource: News24\n\nBack to homepage.", "description": "", "authors": ["City Press Via News"], "top_image": "https://myhome.24.com/Cape-Town-properties-outshine-Paris-and-NYC/assets/9KUBYtznse/zoe-reeve-xjjd9fu9okm-unsplash-2560x1920.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
