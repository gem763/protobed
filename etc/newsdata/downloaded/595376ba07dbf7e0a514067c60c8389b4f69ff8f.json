If you can do this effectively, you will avoid the unproductive work of recouping losses and can benefit from the great power of compounding. Not losing money in a poor market determines your level of success more than anything\n\n\n\nLike most things in the market, keeping your investment accounts near highs is easier said than done. This goal is in direct competition with the well-known advice that you should hold on to high-quality stocks for the long term.\n\nEven the best long-term investments will undergo deep corrections at times. Apple (AAPL) , for example, has fallen nearly 50% from its highs before recovering and going on to hit even higher highs.\n\n\n\nThe dilemma for many market players is how to hold on to our favorite stocks but still prevent major drawdowns in poor market. Anyone that has traded during a major market correction knows the pain and suffering that occurs when trying to hold on to key positions as the market steadily falls apart and goes much lower than seems possible.\n\n\n\nThe best way to maintain exposure to our favorite stocks but to avoid major drawdowns in a poor market is to trade around a core position. This works because it allows you to stay connected to the stocks that you favor long term but to reduce your risk when market conditions deteriorate. The steps to do this effectively are as follows:\n\n\n\n1. Establish your initial position without too much concern about entry points. Once you have found a stock that you believe is worthy of being held for the long term the important thing is to own some so that you can become familiar with it. Most stocks have a personality that you will only come to know if you actively watch it. There is no substitute for actual ownership. It is far easier to find the right entry and exits points if you own a stock already.\n\n\n\n2. Make sure you have a clear trading plan. At what point do you reduce the position? Do you take some profits into strength? Where do you set a sell stop or a new buy stop? How large should your core position versus your trading position?\n\n\n\n3. The hard part is actually executing that trading plan. It can be particularly difficult to cut back one of our favorite stocks even when it is acting poorly. There is a tendency to tell ourselves that this is a great stock and is sure to come roaring back.\n\n\n\n4. The secret to trading around a core position is what I call the remount. If you don't get back in then you will eventually find that your big winner is just a minor position. This is the downfall of most people that try to try around a core position. They don't have a good plan for the remount.\n\n\n\n5. Accurately timing a remount is less important than managing the stock. You can buy a stock at any time and as long you have a clear stop out point then you can manage risk.\n\n\n\nTrading around a core position is a way to merge the power of active trading with long term buy-and-hold. The ultimate goal is to use the power of compounding and you can do that by focusing on keeping accounts at highs while maintaining a connection to stocks you favor in the long term. It requires additional effort but can produce exceptional results.\n\n(Apple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS member club. Want to be alerted before Jim Cramer buys or sells AAPL?
