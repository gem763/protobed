It was unclear if the woman who returned the victim's possessions was one of the women who was arrested.\n\nThe victim's iPhone was said to be missing when her property was given back to her.\n\nSources told the New York Post that the apartment where the incident took place belonged to Keyna Cuevas and John Cuevas.
