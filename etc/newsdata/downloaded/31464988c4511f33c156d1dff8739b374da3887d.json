Be true to yourself\n\nSam admits he\u2019s a naturally introvert which is not what people might anticipate from a rugby captain: \u201cYou\u2019d expect a really big, alpha-male, dominant figure,\u201d says the ex-player. But one of the best pieces of advice he received was to be true to himself, so he learned to do things his own way.\n\nIf you try and fake things, people see straight through it. Sam Warburton\n\n\u201cI always did what made me happy and what I thought was right,\u201d says Sam. He wasn\u2019t afraid to stay sober, despite the peer pressure to drink, because he knew it was right for him.\n\n\u201cIf you try and fake things, people see straight through it,\u201d says Sam. \u201cI\u2019ve seen captains try to be someone they\u2019re not and it stands out like a sore thumb.\u201d\n\nFigure out what your own strengths are, who you are as a person and how you want to lead in your own style.\n\n2. Reach for the stars\n\nWhen Sam was young a teacher said to him, \u201cReach for the stars because if you fail, you\u2019ll still reach the sky.\u201d It\u2019s something he\u2019s always held on to.\n\nAlthough not everyone will be blessed with tackling or kicking ability, \u201cit doesn\u2019t take any talent to get up off the floor, to work hard or to get up early and train,\u201d he says.\n\nIt\u2019s not the tools you\u2019re born with but being driven that\u2019s important: \u201cIf you want to get to the very top of something, you\u2019ve got to have a deep underlying passion and self-motivating power.\u201d\n\n3. Be professional\n\n\u201cI always prided myself on trying to be the best professional that I could ever be,\u201d Sam says. \u201cI made sure I ate the right foods, didn\u2019t go out, didn\u2019t misbehave and looked after my body.\u201d\n\nHe thinks this approach gave him a psychological edge over the opposition: \u201cI knew when I took to the pitch, I was in the best possible shape that I could be.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not about total abstinence, admits the ex-captain. He\u2019d still go and have a pizza in the week: \u201cYou need those little rewards along the way otherwise you just drive yourself mad and it\u2019s not sustainable long-term.\u201d", "description": "The former Lions captain's guide to life", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07r8fw9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
