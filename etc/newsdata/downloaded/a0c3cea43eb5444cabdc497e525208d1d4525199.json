Five crew members, including the captain, who were all on the top deck jumped overboard and survived. The 34 others were apparently sleeping below deck and became trapped when flames blocked both a stairway and an escape hatch, according to the sheriff's office.\n\nThe burning boat sank in 65 feet of water and overturned as firefighters battled the flames. A day later, the U.S. Coast Guard called off the search for possible survivors, shifting its efforts to search and recovery.\n\nDNA collected from family members is being used to identify the victims, who are believed to range in age from in their teens to their 60s, according to the sheriff's office.\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board has launched an investigation into what caused the fire. The agency sent a 16-member investigative team to the scene last week. They are collecting evidence and expected to interview the crew, witnesses and first responders, according to NTSB member Jennifer Homendy.\n\nA full report on what led to the calamity is not expected for over a year.\n\nDuring an interview with ABC News last week, Homendy said the crew members tried to get to the passengers sleeping below deck but were pushed back by fierce flames. They then went to the front of the ship and tried to break through its windows. When that didn't work, they ultimately had to look out for their own safety.\n\n\"At some point because of heat, smoke and fire they had to jump off the boat,\" she said.\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nThe boat was required to have smoke detectors, fixed firefighting equipment in the engine room and fire extinguishers throughout, including ones at the front and rear of the vessel, according to Capt. Monica Rochester of the U.S. Coast Guard, who told reporters last week that all the required firefighting apparatus was accounted for during the most recent inspection.\n\nIt remains under investigation whether the smoke detectors were working at the time of the blaze and if the crew attempted to use the firefighting equipment before abandoning ship, Rochester said.\n\nABC News' Will Carr and Bill Hutchinson contributed to this report.", "description": "Divers have recovered the body of the final missing victim of a boat fire off the Southern California coast that killed 34 people last week.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/ca-boat-fire-search-for-victims-ap-mw-20190912_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
