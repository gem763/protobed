Hanes, McKay\u2019s lawyer, said that the potential violation would be a misdemeanor if the investigators conclude that the supervisor should have disclosed as a gift the difference between the $850,000 he and his wife paid for the house and its actual market value at the time. Hanes said McKay paid a fair price for the five-bedroom home.\n\nNeither the Virginia State Police nor the state attorney general\u2019s office would confirm or deny that they are investigating the home sale. WAMU radio reported that the agencies were conducting a criminal probe.\n\nThat report, citing multiple anonymous sources, said Attorney General Mark R. Herring signed off on the inquiry in early August and that it is in its preliminary stages, with no charges filed.\n\nThe claims stem from an ethics complaint filed in May by developer Tim Chapman, one of three Democrats who lost to McKay in the June primary election for board chairman of Virginia\u2019s largest jurisdiction.\n\nIn the complaint, Chapman alleged that McKay helped engineer the 2016 rezoning of a portion of the Kingstowne Towne Center inside Lee District \u2014 which he represents \u2014 as part of a deal on his home purchase nearly a year later.\n\nMcKay and his wife bought their five-bedroom home in the Alexandria section of Fairfax for $850,000, which an investigation commissioned by Chapman claimed was less than comparably sized homes in that area. The sale price was slightly more than its assessed value.\n\nThe Chapman investigation, initially circulated in an anonymous memo, used public documents to suggest the purchase coincided with the June 2016 rezoning that allowed residential development on a five-acre portion of the massive Kingstowne site, which the county board approved unanimously.\n\nThe memo noted that, around the same time, developer Michael A. McGhan \u2014 a friend of McKay\u2019s \u2014 was in the process of buying land that eventually became the site of McKay\u2019s home from Kingstowne developer Warren Halle. Halle\u2019s businesses have donated a total of $50,000 to McKay\u2019s bid for chairman.\n\nIf McKay had a business relationship with Halle during the time the rezoning was being considered, under state law he would have had to disclose it as a conflict of interest. Halle\u2019s company owned the parcel that was rezoned.\n\nFormer county board chairman John F. \u201cJack\u201d Herrity was convicted of a misdemeanor in 1986 for failing to disclose a relationship with a builder.\n\nMcKay said there was no such relationship. But he has acknowledged that McGhan sold the house he built on the land directly to him, without marketing it to other prospective buyers.\n\nHanes, a veteran land-use and real estate lawyer in Fairfax, investigated Chapman\u2019s claims and called them \u201ca witch hunt,\u201d noting that the similarly sized homes used to suggest that \u00adMcKay got a deal on his house were in more expensive neighborhoods.\n\nStill, even a suggestion of criminal wrongdoing could hurt McKay politically as he heads into the November election against Republican Joseph Galdo to replace Board Chairman Sharon Bulova (D-At Large), who is retiring after 30 years on the county board.\n\nOn Thursday, Bulova, a staunch ally of McKay\u2019s who has groomed him for her seat, called the allegations \u201cpolitically motivated.\u201d\n\n\u201cJeff is an honest, ethical colleague,\u201d she said. \u201cI would be surprised if these allegations are true.\u201d\n\nGaldo, whose chances of winning in the solidly blue county have been slim, pounced on the suggestion that McKay benefited financially from his friendship with a developer.\n\n\u201cThese allegations are very troubling,\u201d Galdo said in a statement. \u201cWhat\u2019s clear right now is that we need more transparency from our elected officials, whose job is to advance the interests of everyday residents \u2014 not well-connected developers.\u201d\n\nJeff McKay accused of quid pro quo. So, he launched his own probe.\n\nWith Democratic primaries over in Fairfax, GOP candidates gear for battle.\n\nSharon Bulova, longtime chair of Fairfax board, to step down after 30 years.\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news,", "description": "The Democratic candidate for county board chair has been dogged by claims that he benefited from a quid pro quo relationship with a developer.", "authors": ["Antonio Olivo", "Reporter Covering Government", "Politics", "Demographics In Northern Virginia"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/C2DQTAUDHMI6TNMF4NVRNJJRVI.jpg"}
