In Republican-held districts, the advantage was 53 percent to 40 percent, according to the poll, while the advantage was 47 percent to 43 percent in Democratic districts.\n\nIn districts won by President Trump Donald John TrumpWhite House says Turkey will soon launch Syria operation Trump associates pressured Ukraine over gas firm in order to benefit allies: report Trump praises Woodward, slams other journalists over 'Face the Nation' segment MORE but now held by Democrats, the advantage for Republicans, according to the memo, was 54 percent to 38 percent.\n\n\u201cCongressional Democrats who represent Trump districts appear to be in a precarious position here, as their voters clearly side against impeachment and are much more willing to vote for a GOP candidate opposing impeachment than a Democrat supporting it,\u201d a slide from a PowerPoint presentation provided to members and obtained by The Hill reads.\n\nThe poll also found that 62 percent of those surveyed don\u2019t believe the phone call in which President Trump pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenTrump associates pressured Ukraine over gas firm in order to benefit allies: report Trump praises Woodward, slams other journalists over 'Face the Nation' segment Why Elizabeth Warren will fail to shine in her moment on the trail MORE is an impeachable offense.\n\nThirty-one Democrats hold districts won by Trump.

Democratic leadership had feared an impeachment push could hurt such Democrats, and leaders had not moved forward before the news on Ukraine.\n\nWhile the NRCC\u2019s data shows impeachment could prove to be problematic for Democrats in certain districts, a number of recent polls have shown an uptick in support for impeachment.\n\nThe poll \u2014 conducted from Oct. 1 to Oct. 3 by Public Opinion Strategies on behalf of the NRCC and Team McCarthy \u2014 surveyed 800 registered voters in targeted congressional districts across the country.\n\nIt included two parts: forty House seats held by Republicans that need to be defended and 55 House seats held by Democrats that Republicans believe they can win.\n\nThe poll had a margin of error of 3.46 percentage points.", "description": "House GOP leaders are telling their rank-and-file members that impeachment will backfire on Democrats and give the GOP a chance to flip dozens of Democratic-held seats next year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_092019as_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
