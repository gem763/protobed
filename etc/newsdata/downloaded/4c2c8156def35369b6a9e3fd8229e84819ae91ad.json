It's a game for all shapes and sizes and let's hope that continues.\"\n\nEdwards added: \"If you want to go and watch a game of rugby, you want to go and watch Cheslin Kolbe. We have to keep our eye on him, he's one of the most dynamic players I've ever seen.\"\n\nBut it wasn't just Kolbe about whom Edwards was worried, with Makazole Mapimpi showing equal ability on the left wing for South Africa, as well as free-running Willie le Roux, always a dangerman at full-back.\n\n\"They've got blow torch speed on the edges,\" he said.\n\n\"If there were a 4x100m relay race of all the teams involved in the World Cup they'd be fastest. They've got some incredible pace out wide.\"\n\nEdwards warned, however, that attack was only one weapon in the Springboks' armoury.\n\n\"They are very well coached, any team Rassie Erasmus coaches is fantastic defensively, probably the best defensive team in the world at the moment.\"\n\n\"They're going to be well-organised and they're going to have a strong defence and strong kicking game.\"\n\nWales have racked up five wins from the last six against South Africa, but Edwards said that counted for nothing.\n\n\"Personally don't think it has a bearing on the game. Each game is a different entity,\" he said, adding: \"It's 'seize-the-moment' time.\n\n\"These opportunities don't come around very often. The last time was in 2011 (when Wales lost to France in the semi-final) and we just missed out then. You want to be in the big games and there's no bigger than the World Cup final.\"", "description": "Springbok winger Cheslin Kolbe has the lightning pace and physical build reminiscent of England's World Cup winner Jason Robinson, says Shaun Edwards.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7968/c9345c81bc1043b0b7d0ca538026c004.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
