He was giving\n\nus a final piece of advice before we left the room.\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019ve broken an egg, it stays broken. Once you\u2019ve said something, it stays said.\n\n\"There might be ups and downs along the way but you\u2019ve got to support each other. Remember that, whatever happens from now on.\u201d\n\nThese words would turn out to be a piece of advice more valuable than I could ever have imagined.\n\nAfter three years of trying for a baby unsuccessfully, Natalie and I then went on to lose three babies in three years, each in very different circumstances, surprising the seasoned medical staff of one of London\u2019s biggest hospitals with our odds-defying bad luck.\n\nThe first pregnancy, in early 2014, was progressing normally as far as we were concerned until the 12-week scan, where abnormalities were identified.\n\nDespite Natalie having taken folic acid throughout the pregnancy, at 16 weeks it was confirmed our baby had severe spina bifida.\n\nAfter much agonising and soul-searching, we took the extremely difficult decision to have a Termination for Medical Reasons (TFMR) at 18 weeks. Our baby would have been a little boy, who we called Osian.\n\nBecause of this experience, when Natalie fell pregnant again the following year, the hospital brought us in for earlier scans.\n\nAt seven weeks the foetus had hardly grown and the heart was beating extremely slowly.\n\nThe midwife said that the pregnancy was very likely to end in a miscarriage in the coming weeks.\n\nThe following week it was confirmed that the heart had indeed stopped and Nats underwent a procedure to remove the foetus.\n\nI had always wanted to be a dad but we were five years into trying for a baby and I started to feel that fatherhood was\n\nslipping out of my grasp.\n\nThe harder I tried, the more it eluded me. For the first time in my life it started to dawn on me that my chances of fatherhood might be in jeopardy.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/EyeEm)\n\nI began to feel like a misfit, in a strange limbo between a happy bachelor and family man. And because men don\u2019t really talk about it, I felt like I was the only wannabe dad in the world.\n\nEach time Nats and I lost a baby, my own desire to become a father grew. There were times when I was scared and unsure if I had the reserves of strength to keep on going but we just did.\n\nAt the start of 2016, Natalie fell pregnant for a third time. We told no one that she was pregnant this time, not even our closest family. Passing the 20-week milestone was a big step.\n\nNeither of us acknowledged it, but we were both aware of it as we moved beyond this halfway point in the pregnancy.\n\nThere was now more time behind us than there was ahead.\n\nAt the end of May, in week 23 of the pregnancy, Natalie felt unwell and took herself to hospital to make sure everything was OK.\n\nAlmost the instant she arrived, her waters broke. Despite this we were told it would still be potentially possible to carry the baby to near full term.\n\nNatalie stayed in hospital for tests, but three days later I received a call in the middle of the night to tell me they\n\nhad taken Natalie for a scan and found that our baby\u2019s heart had stopped.\n\nShe had died.\n\nWe named our little girl Lux. In the months following Lux\u2019s funeral, I often felt as if I was surrounded by the ghostly projections of what might have been.\n\nLike there was a tribe of phantom versions of me walking round representing my alternative lives where the pregnancies worked out and I went on to become a happy, proud dad.\n\nIn my head I\u2019d be pushing the pram up and down our neighbourhood on a Sunday morning, pacing the flat in the early hours lulling the little one back to sleep, planning the first journey to take him or her back home to Wales. In the early weeks, I found myself forgetting Nats was not pregnant anymore.\n\nPreviously, I would have found it difficult to understand how parents could have mourned the loss of an unborn baby. Simply writing that shocks me now.\n\nI\u2019m certainly not that person anymore. It\u2019s bleak, of course, but with the hope, love and ultimate loss of each of our children, I have probably become a better person.\n\nOur losses tested us to the limit and turned our lives upside down and inside out on a daily basis. It also showed me that while the majority of focus when a couple lose a baby, quite rightly, goes to the mother, there\u2019s also the father\u2019s side of the story which often goes untold.\n\nThe traditional strong and silent role that a man plays in these circumstances is a valuable one but it\u2019s important to remember that as the baby\u2019s father, men obviously have feelings, thoughts and aspirations that need to be acknowledged too.\n\nI was convinced I couldn\u2019t be the only man to feel as I did about what I had started to call \u201cphantom fatherhood\u201d. Eventually, I realised I was going to have to change my mindset if I wanted to stay healthy and sane.\n\nAfter the third baby, we had no plans to try again, we were still stunned. It was time to take stock.\n\nI soon realised that getting over what had already happened was only half the battle, because it\u2019s not the past that\u2019s the problem. The past is behind you, you know what you\u2019re dealing with.\n\nThe future is a far more daunting prospect.\n\nAs unnatural as it felt \u2013 because wanting a baby had become our entire lives \u2013 I realised I had to start viewing life through a wider lens.\n\nYes, I had always wanted to be a dad but in the past few years it had turned into all I had ever wanted.\n\nI tried to recall who I was before we started trying for a family and realised I\u2019d have to adopt a different outlook. I left my permanent job and started working for myself.\n\nIt was a risk, but I just wasn\u2019t scared of failure or disappointment anymore. I started to adapt my life to our circumstances, seeing the opportunities rather than the challenges they offered.\n\nCreating the beginning of this momentum where I could believe that a rounded and fulfilled life without children could be achievable was a breakthrough.\n\nWhile Natalie and I went our separate ways in 2018, we remain great friends.\n\nI\u2019m now single and if I don\u2019t go on to become a father again, I know the desire will always be there, but the prospect doesn\u2019t fill me with as much dread as it used to.\n\nI\u2019ve written a book about my experience, which Natalie fully supports.\n\nIf that can help others, then it will feel as though I have turned everything we went through into something positive.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0 Richard\u2019s book, The Phantom Father, is available on Amazon .

Let them. Earmark time to recharge. If nothing else, the better you are feeling, the better you can support your partner.\n\nIgnore the stereotypes\n\nAs men, we still need reminding that stereotypes can put unhelpful pressure on us to act a certain way. Losing a baby can inspire emotions you never knew you had. What\u2019s more, feeling frightened, unsure and fragile is natural and nothing to be ashamed of.\n\nDon\u2019t compare yourself with others\n\nAs difficult as it may be, this is your life and this is what you have to work with. Comparing yourself with others and asking \u2018why me?\u2019 can be tempting but it will only increase resentment which will harm you more than anyone.\n\nBe realistic\n\nWhen trying for a baby your fate is largely out of your hands. Do as much as you can realistically do but don\u2019t blame yourself when things go wrong.\n\nKeep plans in perspective\n\nIt can be easy to be consumed completely by trying for a baby. Try to keep active in other areas of your life that offer fulfilment in the here and now, and in your plans for the future.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Rich Ellis, 44, from London and his former partner Natalie lost three babies in three years.
