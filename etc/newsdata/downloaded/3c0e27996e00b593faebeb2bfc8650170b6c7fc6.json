'It's a very special tradition, as we have both overcome a number of personal challenges during our time together, and the symbolism of watching a new day begin is deeply meaningful for us.'\n\nToo early? A Reddit user has revealed that she and her fiance are receiving backlash from their families for planning a 'sunrise wedding' that starts at 5:30 a.m.\n\nThe woman said she and her husband-to-be came up with the idea of having a sunrise ceremony on the beach followed by Bloody Marys and mimosas at a beachfront restaurant that has agreed to open early.\n\n'After that, everyone is free for the remainder of the day,' she explained. 'Our friends and family are mostly local and should all be able to travel to the beach in under an hour, except for some extended family flying in from Canada, but that's unavoidable.'\n\nThe woman said they used their geographic location and the date of their wedding next summer to come up with the 5:30 a.m. start time, which will be right at dawn.\n\n'We've been getting a LOT of backlash from our families about this, who say this is way too early and we need to move the ceremony to a more \"normal\" time of day,' she admitted. 'But my fiance and I don't feel like we're asking for anything that unreasonable.'\n\nOther suggestions: Many commenters tactfully explained that while the idea is nice in theory, it is too early and would likely end up causing a lot of unwanted drama\n\nThe bride ended her post by asking if she is the 'a**hole' in this situation for wanting a sunrise wedding.\n\nConsidering it is her big day, many commenters tactfully explained that while the idea is nice in theory, it would likely end up causing a lot of unwanted drama.\n\nPeople suggested that she and her fiance could have a private sunrise ceremony like they planned followed by a second ceremony for guests later in the day.\n\n'A good solution is to have a private ceremony with you and your fianc\u00e9 at 5:30, and then have a second ceremony at a more reasonable time for the guests,' one person wrote.\n\n'The first one can be just the two of you reciting your vows to each other, or the two of you with a willing officiant and a handful of close friends/relatives who are willing to join. If having two ceremonies is too costly and unreasonable, then just do the first option with the two of you only, speaking private vows.'\n\nControversy: Some stated that she and her fiance should do whatever they want on their wedding day, but a majority of people thought it was disrespectful of them\n\n'Isn\u2019t part of what\u2019s magical about the sunrise supposed to be how peaceful and private and quiet it is?' someone else asked. 'Don\u2019t drag a bunch of people into your happy sunrise who aren\u2019t 100% thrilled to be there. Keep that for you and your spouse, just the two of you.'\n\nSome stated that she and her fiance should do whatever they want on their wedding day and defended their choice, but a majority of people thought it was disrespectful for them to expect their guests to get up in the wee hours of the morning to get ready.\n\nA few people had no problem admitting they wouldn't show up to a wedding that was held that early.\n\n'I wouldn't attend this wedding, that's a crazy time, however it's your wedding, so do you,' one Reddit user commented. 'Just be aware there may be low attendance...\n\n'I mean do what you want, but if I was a guest I would think YTA [you are the a**hole] 100% Are you going to throw a fit if one of your bridesmaids is late, or family isn't on time and you miss the sunrise / ceremony?' someone else asked.\n\n'S** happens and I can almost guarantee something stupid is going to happen and someone or something will be late. I mean honestly if you want to have 5 people and do this then I would kinda understand, but a large group of people? Yes you are an a**hole.'", "description": "Reddit user sunrisewedding took to the 'AmItheA**hole' subreddit this week to ask if she was in the wrong for planning such an early wedding ceremony.", "authors": ["Erica Tempesta For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/22/20399206-0-image-a-73_1572475078683.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
