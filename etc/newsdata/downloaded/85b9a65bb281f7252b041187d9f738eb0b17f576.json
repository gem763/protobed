We find an angle and we go after it.\"\n\nThat episode was about 10 years ago. Now, the company competes with Nike, Adidas, and others for multi-million-dollar endorsement deals with some of the world's most successful athletes.\n\nBest known for its performance wear, Under Armour has grown rapidly over the past 23 years. When it was founded in 1996, it had $17,000 in revenue. In 2014, sales soared 32% over the previous year to $3.08 billion.\n\nGrowth has been slowing lately, however. Revenue last year grew just 4% over the previous year to $5.2 billion.\n\nThat's still a fraction of Nike's revenue, which grew 7.5% to $39.1 billion in fiscal 2019.\n\nPlank will transition to executive chairman and brand chief on January 1. He will be replaced as CEO by Chief Operating Officer Patrik Frisk", "description": "Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank had to offer a golfer $8,000 up-front to wear Under Armour gear at the Masters.", "authors": ["Hayley Peterson"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/56324b00bd86ef14008c5b8c?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
