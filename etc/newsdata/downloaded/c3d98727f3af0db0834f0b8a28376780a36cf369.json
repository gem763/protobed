REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\nHere are brief profiles of some of those with new jobs in the cabinet.\n\nTOSHIMITSU MOTEGI, FOREIGN MINISTER\n\nAs economy minister, Motegi, 63, faced off with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer over a deal that President Donald Trump wants to help reduce the big trade imbalance between the two allies.\n\nThe Liberal Democratic Party lawmaker was trade minister under Abe when the latter returned to power in 2012, tackling negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade pact.\n\nEducated at the University of Tokyo and Harvard, the English-speaking Motegi was first elected to the lower house in 1993 from the then-opposition Japan New Party. He joined the LDP in 1995.\n\nTARO KONO, DEFENCE MINISTER\n\nKono, 56, has a reputation as a maverick but has toed the line on key Abe policies including a stern stance in a feud with South Korea over wartime history and trade.\n\nEducated at Georgetown University and a fluent English speaker well-known in Washington, Kono served as minister for administrative reform and became foreign minister in 2017.\n\nHe has sought to differentiate his often more conservative stances from those of his father, former chief cabinet secretary Yohei Kono, who authored a landmark 1993 apology to \u201ccomfort women\u201d, a Japanese euphemism for women forced to work in Japanese military wartime brothels.\n\nSHINJIRO KOIZUMI, ENVIRONMENT MINISTER\n\nKoizumi, the 38-year-old son of charismatic former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi, is the third-youngest person to become a cabinet minister and regularly tops polls as the person most favoured to take over after Abe.\n\nAs environment minister, Koizumi could be in an awkward spot given Abe\u2019s commitment to nuclear power. The elder Koizumi, now retired from parliament, became a harsh critic of atomic energy after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear crisis.\n\nRegularly referred to as Shinjiro to distinguish him from his father, Koizumi last month announced he would marry Christel Takigawa, 42, a French-Japanese television presenter known as the face of Tokyo\u2019s successful bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics.\n\nYASUTOSHI NISHIMURA, ECONOMY MINISTER\n\nThe 56-year-old Nishimura, a former trade official and deputy chief cabinet secretary, won a lower house seat as an independent in 2003 and later joined the LDP.\n\nNishimura graduated from Tokyo University and the Graduate School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland in the United States. He has three daughters.\n\nKATSUNOBU KATO, HEALTH, LABOUR AND WELFARE MINISTER\n\nA close Abe ally and former finance ministry official, Kato, 63, has served as minister for health, labour and welfare as well as deputy chief cabinet secretary, when he was handled the issue of Japanese abducted by North Korean agents decades ago.\n\nThe father of four daughters, Kato was tasked by Abe in 2015 to find ways to boost the rock-bottom birthrate.\n\nHe first won election to the lower house in 2003.\n\nISSHU SUGAWARA - TRADE AND INDUSTRY MINISTER\n\nSugawara, 57, is a Tokyo native who worked for one of Japan\u2019s largest trading firms before becoming a local lawmaker and then winning election to parliament in 2003.\n\nA former vice trade minister, Sugawara is known for his involvement in budget policies and is close to Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.\n\nSEIKO HASHIMOTO - OLYMPICS MINISTER\n\nHashimoto, 54, is a seven-time Olympian who has taken part as a speedskater and cyclist, winning a bronze medal at the 1992 Albertville Winter Games.\n\nBorn just days before Tokyo hosted the 1964 Summer Games, a pivotal point in modern Japanese history, she was named for the Olympic flame and will now oversee Tokyo\u2019s second hosting of the games in 2020.\n\nHashimoto became the first upper house lawmaker to give birth while in office. Married to a policeman, she is the mother of six children, three from a first marriage.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\nKOICHI HAGIUDA - EDUCATION MINISTER\n\nHagiuda, 56, is a long-time Abe ally who has served as deputy chief cabinet secretary, vice minister for education and special adviser to Abe.\n\nHagiuda has on occasion made waves with outspoken remarks. In early 2014 he lashed out at then-U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s administration for expressing \u201cdisappointment\u201d over Abe\u2019s visit the previous month to Tokyo\u2019s controversial Yasukuni Shrine for war dead.", "description": "Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reshuffled his cabinet on Wednesday, keeping allies such as Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga and Finance Minister Taro Aso in their posts..", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428579491&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A0AQ", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
