He has insisted that slashing interest rates would boost the global economy.\n\nThe U.S. economy is in its 11th year of expansion, the longest on record. To help avoid a recession, the Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark interest rate twice this year.\n\nPowell did not mention Trump by name in his brief remarks in Utah but highlighted Eccles\u2019 work to safeguard the central bank from outside influence.\n\n\u201cI leave you with this statement from Marriner, inscribed on a plaque in the Eccles Building: \u2018The management of the central bank must be absolutely free from the dangers of control by politics and by private interests, singly or combined,'\u201d Powell said.\n\nHe praised Eccles as a smart leader who helped the U.S. recover from the Great Depression. Eccles served as chairman from 1934 until 1948.\n\nPowell is expected to speak in Denver on Tuesday at a business conference.", "description": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Monday stressed the importance of an independent central bank \"absolutely free\" from", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/07/677047_powell-trump-05958-jerome-powell-federal-reserve-chairman-jerome-powell-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
