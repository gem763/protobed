Analysts say an agreement would provide a boost to global oil demand.\n\n\"Looking further ahead, if trade talks continue to progress, and we see full agreement to phase 1 of the deal, this should help to improve sentiment further,\" ING analyst Warren Patterson said.\n\nRussia's energy ministry said that the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its oil-exporting allies, known as OPEC+, would factor in any slowdown of US oil output growth when they meet to discuss their output agreement in December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Russian Deputy Energy Minister Pavel Sorokin said it was premature to talk about deeper production cuts.\n\nUS crude output has surged to records above 12 million barrels per day this year, thanks to gains from the Permian basin that have made the United States the world's largest producer ahead of Saudi Arabia and Russia.\n\nThe rate of growth has, however, been tempered as US energy companies reduced the number of oil rigs in October for a record 11 months, under pressure from investors to cut spending on new drilling.\n\nOPEC+ has since January implemented a deal to cut output by 1.2 million bpd to support the market. The pact runs to March 2020 and the producers meet to review policy on December 5-6.\n\n\"We are of the view that an extension of current cuts is path of least resistance for the producer group, while deeper cuts will be far more difficult to agree on,\" Harry Tchilinguirian, global oil strategist at BNP Paribas in London said.\n\nReuters", "description": "Weak Chinese data and the prospect of higher US stockpiles snapped a four-day rally in oil prices.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d25a9904950e19a8b4a1bfa511d8a11c23bb862c", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
