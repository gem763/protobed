The New York Times first identified the whistleblower as a CIA officer, which Reuters confirmed.\n\nHouse of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused the president of involvement in a cover-up to hide details of his attempts to persuade Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Democratic presidential contender ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nTrump reacted with fury on Thursday and assailed Pelosi\u2019s Democrats for launching an impeachment inquiry into him this week over the Ukraine affair.\n\nTrump told staff from the U.S. mission to the United Nations he wanted to know who provided information to the whistleblower, according to an audio recording provided to the Los Angeles Times by an attendee.\n\n\u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person, who\u2019s the person who gave the whistleblower the information. Because that\u2019s close to a spy,\u201d Trump can be heard saying on the recording.\n\n\u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe White House did not dispute the comments.\n\nA joint statement by three Democratic House committee chairmen - Adam Schiff of Intelligence, Eliot Engel of Foreign Affairs and Elijah Cummings of Oversight - said Trump\u2019s \u201cthreats of violence\u201d constituted \u201creprehensible witness intimidation.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Representative Raja Kirshnamoorthi, a member of the Intelligence Committee, said it was essential that the committee hear from the whistleblower.\n\n\u201cWe need to talk to the whistleblower at the earliest, because I am concerned at some of the statements the president has been making about the whistleblower, and whether he\u2019s going to retaliate against the guy,\u201d he said.\n\nOn July 25, Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and his son, according to a summary of the telephone call released by the Trump administration on Wednesday.\n\nBiden\u2019s son Hunter worked for a Ukrainian gas company for several years.\n\nActing Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Joseph Maguire is sworn in to testifify before a House Intelligence Committee hearing on the handling of the whistleblower complaint in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., September 26, 2019. REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nA growing number of Democrats say the call was an abuse of Trump\u2019s position and want to see him impeached. But the chances of the Republican president being removed from office look slim since his party controls the Senate where an impeachment trial would be held.\n\n\u2018DEEPLY CONCERNED\u2019\n\nThe call occurred after Trump had ordered a freeze of nearly $400 million in American aid to Ukraine, which was only later released. Before the call, Ukraine\u2019s government was told that interaction between Zelenskiy and Trump depended on whether the Ukrainian leader would \u201cplay ball,\u201d the whistleblower said.\n\nThe report said Trump acted to advance his personal political interests, risking national security.\n\n\u201cI am deeply concerned that the actions described below constitute \u2018a serious or flagrant problem, abuse, or violation of law or executive order,\u2019\u201d the whistleblower complaint, dated Aug. 12, said.\n\nPelosi said the fact that White House officials moved records of the call to another electronic system was evidence of a cover-up. \u201cThe president has been engaged in a cover-up all along,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Trump administration released the summary of the call after media reports about it surfaced.\n\nThe Ukraine controversy follows U.S. intelligence conclusions that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election with a campaign of hacking and propaganda to boost Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s concerns did not end with Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelenskiy. The next day, the report said, a U.S. special envoy for Ukraine negotiations and the U.S. ambassador to the European Union met with Zelenskiy and other Ukrainians and advised them \u201cabout how to \u2018navigate\u2019 the demands that the president had made of Mr Zelenskiy.\u201d\n\nTrump has repeatedly suggested wrongdoing by Biden and his son but has offered no evidence to back up the assertion. There has been no evidence that Biden used his position to help his son in the Ukraine matter.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans criticized the report. \u201cClearly a coordinated effort to take second-hand information to create a narrative damaging to the President,\u201d Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said in a statement.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing.\n\nIn the report, the whistleblower said that \u201cI was not a direct witness to most of the events described\u201d and based the account on information from colleagues.\n\nDuring a House Intelligence Committee hearing, the top U.S. intelligence official, acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, said the whistleblower had acted in good faith and followed the law in bringing the complaint.\n\nMaguire frustrated committee Democrats when he declined to say whether he had discussed the whistleblower complaint with Trump. Maguire said it would not be \u201cappropriate\u201d for him to publicly rebuke Trump\u2019s attacks on the whistleblower.\n\nSlideshow (12 Images)\n\nMaguire testified about the document after refusing for weeks to share it with Congress. Democrats said federal law required that the report be sent to lawmakers.\n\nSchiff, the Democratic committee chairman, grilled Maguire about why the whistleblower report was withheld. Trump, Schiff said, \u201chas betrayed his oath of office, betrayed his oath to defend our national security and betrayed his oath to defend the Constitution.\u201d\n\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, the House has the power to impeach a president for \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanours.\u201d No president has ever been removed through impeachment.", "description": "A whistleblower report released on Thursday said President Donald Trump not only abused his office in attempting to solicit Ukraine's interference in the 2020 U.S. election for his political benefit, but that the White House tried to \"lock down\" evidence about that conduct.", "authors": ["Patricia Zengerle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434238086&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P1Q5", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
