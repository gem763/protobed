Something about it, his facial expression made me feel uneasy and it was at this point I realised there was something not quite straightforward about this situation.\u2019\n\nStyles was advised by his security team not to interact with him, but Tarazeg-Orera began to appear outside his home and in Harry\u2019s local pub, and was twice seen putting items into his letterbox.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe singer said: \u2018I felt sorry for him but at this point I felt very uncomfortable.
