Compounding the concern is the GM strike because the automaker represents roughly 5 per cent of annual steel demand in the U.S.\n\n\u201cKind of the way to think about it is each day GM isn\u2019t producing cars is one more step towards that roughly 5 per cent of annual demand,\u201d Cleve Rueckert, an analyst at UBS, said Monday in a phone interview.\n\nOptimism has been fading for steelmakers more than a year after the introduction of tariffs meant to bolster the industry. The U.S. trade actions encouraged companies to expand capacity by investing in new mills or upgrading aging assets, leading to fears of oversupply. Despite the hope in July that new steel-price gains may stick, faltering economic growth and U.S.-China trade tensions have dented prospects for the metal.\n\nA S&P gauge of steelmakers has tumbled 8.6 per cent since the GM strike took effect on Sept. 16.\n\nDomestic hot-rolled coil, the benchmark steel price, is down about 39 pre cent in the past 12 months, and is near the lowest price since 2016. Meanwhile, U.S. Steel has fallen 63 per cent in the past year, AK Steel Holding Corp. has dropped 53 per cent, Steel Dynamics Inc. has lost 38 per cent, while U.S. industry leader Nucor Corp. is down 23 per cent.\n\n\u201cRight now we\u2019re struggling to find positive catalysts to support steel prices,\u201d UBS\u2019s Andreas Bokkenheuser, who co-authored the report with Rueckert, said by phone.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "GM represents roughly 5 per cent of annual steel demand in the U.S.", "authors": ["Joe Deaux", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/steel.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
