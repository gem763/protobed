When Richard Gadd won the Edinburgh Comedy award three years ago with Monkey See Monkey Do, it wasn\u2019t just a professional triumph, but a very personal one. His early multimedia comedy traded in sick humour and grindhouse gags, and fixated \u2013 more, surely, than was healthy \u2013 on male sexuality and sexual violence. Then came this extraordinary confessional show about his experience, deeply sublimated in his previous work, as a victim of sexual assault. It was emotionally naked, strayed far beyond humour\u2019s usual remit \u2013 and when it won the biggest prize in comedy, it was a redemption for Gadd and catharsis for his audience.\n\nOr so it seemed at the time. One of the many shocks in Gadd\u2019s new show Baby Reindeer is that it steals away this happy ending. The demons of sexual abuse are not, it turns out, the only demons the Scotsman had to grapple with. Baby Reindeer \u2013 Gadd\u2019s first solo theatre show \u2013 is about his experience of being stalked. It\u2019s gone on for years. It is (give or take a legal technicality) still going on. And it entered a traumatic new stage only weeks after Gadd\u2019s 2016 award triumph, when he thought he\u2019d put the worst of his troubles behind him.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Edge-of-the-seat stuff \u2026 Gadd performs Baby Reindeer in Edinburgh this summer. Photograph: Andrew Perry\n\n\u201cThat was the worst part,\u201d he says now. \u201cIt felt like I\u2019d expunged the demons of one person who had caused me so much grief, only so that she [his stalker] could take centre stage in his place. It felt so awfully ironic.\u201d The 30-year-old is talking at the Edinburgh fringe, at which Baby Reindeer was both sell-out and talking point. For legal reasons, he must be careful what he says \u2013 but the gripping, gruelling show speaks volumes about the harassment he\u2019s suffered. It\u2019s edge-of-the-seat stuff, it\u2019s a plea for a new legal approach to stalking \u2013 and it\u2019s a murky account of two damaged souls unable to escape one another\u2019s grip.\n\nThat moral muddiness is what gives the show its particular charge. Gadd almost staged it a year ago, but postponed \u2013 because he got an acting job on BBC teen thriller Clique, but also because \u201cI hadn\u2019t quite grasped it yet. If I\u2019d rushed it a year ago, it would have just been a victim narrative. And everyone would have come out saying \u2018oh you\u2019re so brave, and well done for doing this\u2019.\u201d\n\nWhich is emphatically not the show he went on to make. \u201cIt would be unfair to say she was an awful person and I was a victim,\u201d says Gadd. \u201cThat didn\u2019t feel true.\u201d\n\nOne complicating factor is gender: Gadd\u2019s story reverses the usual male/female roles in harassment narratives. While there were points when he feared for his personal safety (\u201cAbsolutely. Loads of times\u201d), he was physically stronger than his tormentor. But emotionally \u2013 not so much. In Baby Reindeer, Gadd portrays himself as a very troubled man, failing to come to terms with his assault, wrestling with his sexuality, weirdly flattered by the interest of this woman he first meets in his casual job working at a bar. In the audience, we know she\u2019s trouble. So it\u2019s excruciating to watch Gadd, time after time, make disastrous choices about how to deal with her.\n\n\u201cI did loads of things wrong,\u201d he admits, \u201cand made the situation worse. I wasn\u2019t a perfect person [back then], so there\u2019s no point saying I was. And I know as I\u2019m doing those sections that people are thinking I\u2019m not a nice person \u2013 which make them difficult to perform.\u201d The show has been only lightly fictionalised, says Gadd. \u201cThe skeleton of the story is absolutely true,\u201d but it wasn\u2019t this morbidly thrilling in real life. \u201cThe feeling you get most of all when you\u2019re getting harassed is relentless tediousness and frustration. I didn\u2019t want the audience to feel that.\u201d\n\nI've been through two police investigations in my life, and they've both been hilarious, fly-on-the-wall terrible\n\nWith director Jon Brittain, Gadd has created a vice-like production that depicts his dialogues with \u201cMartha\u201d. It scrolls their text and email exchanges above our heads (Gadd received 41,000 emails over three years), broadcasts her abusive voicemails, and plays vocal testimonies from bit-part players (Gadd\u2019s parents, his landlord, his girlfriend) in the drama. It also dramatises his desperate encounters with the police, who tell Gadd they can\u2019t help him until Martha issues an explicit threat of violence.\n\n\u201cI was getting told off for harassing the police about being harassed,\u201d says Gadd. In Baby Reindeer, the law starts to feel like Martha\u2019s accomplice in the abuse, as Gadd is forced \u2013 at the cost of his fragile confidence \u2013 to listen to hours of insulting voicemail daily, sifting it for the unguarded remark that might tip Martha\u2019s behaviour into criminality. \u201cI\u2019ve been through two police investigations in my life,\u201d says Gadd, \u201cand they\u2019ve both been hilarious, fly-on-the-wall terrible. Honestly my advice to someone who ever thought of pressing charges would be: it\u2019s a fucking nightmare process, and it takes years.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Moving \u2026 Monkey See Monkey Do was performed on a treadmill. Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian\n\nIt\u2019s his frustration at how stalking is policed, he says \u2013 and he cites the recent high-profile case of Shana Grice\u2019s murder by her ex-boyfriend \u2013 that compelled Gadd to bring his story to the stage. He can\u2019t have done so lightly. As the show makes clear, Martha \u2013 while now, finally, restrained from contacting the artist himself \u2013 is still at large, and until recently has been harassing his friends and family. Might not publicising the story risk escalating her activities?\n\n\u201cI have to admit that it hasn\u2019t,\u201d he says, cautiously. \u201cMaybe seeing this in the press has made her think twice about her behaviour.\u201d At any rate, making the show was a risk worth taking, \u201ca last roll of the dice\u201d to highlight the weak laws around harassment, and the injustice whereby \u201cif you harass someone and the police tell you to stop \u2013 well, what\u2019s to stop you harassing someone else in their life? And that\u2019s the other person\u2019s problem. To me that seems unfair \u2013 and a story worth telling.\u201d But it\u2019s also about highlighting that harassers may need care more than punishment. \u201cShe needs help,\u201d says Gadd of his stalker, \u201cbut she\u2019s not getting any. So her instability would just come down the phone at me every day.\u201d\n\nIt can\u2019t be easy reliving the experience in the present tense every night on stage \u2013 particularly given the knife-edge intensity of Gadd\u2019s performance. Surprisingly, he says that (as he did with Monkey See Monkey Do) he finds it therapeutic \u2013 with the exception of the moments when his parents speak (\u201cI struggle with the massive toll this has taken on them\u201d). It\u2019s certainly a far cry from his days as a comedian, when laughter rather than terror was his stock-in-trade.\n\nGiven the success of the serio-comic Monkey See Monkey Do, I wonder whether Gadd considered making Baby Reindeer as a comedy show. The answer is a resounding no. It was hard enough with his award-winning one, he says: \u201cI remember feeling daunted as I was making it, thinking, \u2018I\u2019m going to have to make the ramifications of sexual abuse funny.\u201d With Baby Reindeer, \u201cwhere are the laughs, really? Am I making fun of her? Am I making fun of the situation? I just thought it was a layer too far if I tried to put jokes in this.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Emotional intensity \u2026 publicity for Gadd\u2019s 2015 show Waiting for Gaddot\n\nIt leaves Gadd at a curious career juncture, as a successful joker now more celebrated for the psychological and emotional intensity of his work. \u201cThe comedian label always sat uneasily with me,\u201d he says now. \u201cThere\u2019s the image the public has of a comedian as a man at a microphone, and that\u2019s quite far away from anything I ever did.\u201d\n\nAnd yet\u2026 He\u2019s still rankled by the criticism Monkey See Monkey Do received (as Hannah Gadsby\u2019s Nanette did the following year) for being more theatre than comedy, and he defends the place of seriousness and emotional honesty in the comedian\u2019s toolbox. \u201cIt\u2019s weird: if a theatre piece uses humour, you don\u2019t go, \u2018Get thee to a Jongleurs\u2019. I don\u2019t know why we\u2019ve come to think that comedy has to be all about gag rate.\u201d\n\nBut he\u2019s not ruling out a return to live comedy: he still has \u201ca few stupid comedy ideas\u201d, itches he wants to scratch. Until then, his greater ambition is adapting his work \u2013 including Baby Reindeer \u2013 for TV, having recently written for The Last Leg and Netflix hit Sex Education. It\u2019s a slog. \u201cI think people see me as slightly mad,\u201d he says. \u201cAlmost like a quarantine section: good to look into for a while, but best not to open it up fully. I think people worry the dark stuff I make will be too strong a brew in this climate,\u201d he says. But that\u2019s the stuff he\u2019s got to make, he says \u2013 \u201cso I won\u2019t stop trying\u201d.\n\n\u2022 Baby Reindeer is at the Bush Theatre, London, 9 October-9 November.", "description": "The soul-baring comedian has turned his experience of being stalked into a gripping piece of theatre, Baby Reindeer", "authors": ["Brian Logan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b88552fea22ce73b182e2990c99fa776a72db373/347_397_5413_3248/master/5413.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5d57925a14fd27fa66757059767c7bbb", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
