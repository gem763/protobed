Four hours later, Markey\u2019s well-informed inference was proven true yet again when Facebook trotted out a new blog post titled \u201cCombating Hate and Extremism,\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s surely no coincidence the image-troubled social giant is scheduled on Wednesday \u2014 along with representatives from Twitter and Google \u2014 to testify at the grimly titled hearing \u201cMass Violence, Extremism and Digital Responsibility\u201d before the Senate\u2019s Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee (of which Markey is a member.)\n\nSpecifically, Facebook is expected to answer for its failure to act during the Christchurch, New Zealand, shooting in March. While the shooter murdered 51 worshippers in cold blood, the footage was streaming live to the platform, then copied and reuploaded millions of times.\n\n\u201cThe video of the attack in Christchurch did not prompt our automatic detection systems because we did not have enough content depicting first-person footage of violent events to effectively train our machine learning technology,\u201d the company claims, in an unusual not-enough-mass-murders-have-trained-the-robots-yet defence. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re working with government and law enforcement officials in the US and UK to obtain camera footage from their firearms training programs.\u201d\n\nGiven that Facebook prefaces this public relations chaff with the caveat that \u201csome of the updates we\u2019re sharing today were implemented in the last few months, while others went into effect last year but haven\u2019t been widely discussed,\u201d it\u2019s unclear how low long this AI-training initiative has been in place. Or, for that matter, which American law enforcement officials Facebook is referring to, specifically.\n\nIn an apparent attempt to further rebut likely questions over the platform\u2019s lack of action tomorrow, Facebook also updated its \u201cDangerous Individuals and Organisations\u201d policy, specifically its definition of terrorists.\n\nHere\u2019s what that looked like in July:\n\nAnd here\u2019s now:\n\nThe only major change is the addition of \u201cadvocates,\u201d which surely will be enough to fool the U.S. Senate into believing Facebook\u2019s foremost priority is social safety instead of the ruthless acquisition of profit. This is to say nothing of the total absence of meaningful details in the post regarding how Facebook polices the groups it considers terrorists, as Countering Crime\u2019s Eileen Carey pointed out:\n\nFacebook claims to remove 99% of terrorist content from Al Qaeda, Isis and their affiliates. For transparency, who are their affiliates? What terrorist organizations are being proactively monitored? Where are the enforcement metrics against terrorist propaganda on Instagram? pic.twitter.com/FmabQtdoMK \u2014 Eileen Carey (@eileenmcarey) September 17, 2019\n\nTo these exact sorts of piddling deflections and the overall lack of collaboration, Markey this morning concluded his remarks by telling platform companies that \u201cat the end of the day frankly I think that\u2019s going to be a huge business mistake \u2014 because we\u2019re not going away.\u201d He added, \u201cwe are, candidly, one significant event away [...] from potentially Congress overreacting, because the next event could really be extraordinarily dramatic.\u201d\n\nGiven that Facebook has shown itself to be a devious pit of snakes time and time again, you have to appreciate Markey\u2019s unbounded optimism that it could at least strive to the bare minimum of America\u2019s favourite contradiction in terms: corporate responsibility.", "description": "\u201cThere\u2019s been a general feeling from the platform companies of kind of playing rope-a-dope with the Congress,\u201d U.S. Senator Ed Markey told a small audience gathered in the U.S. Federal Election Commission\u2019s headquarters around 9am Tuesday morning in America.
