If my bed is made and my in-box is at zero, my mind is at peace. For years, that meant spending 10 exasperated minutes every single day doing what I think we can all agree is the worst part of the bed-making process: jostling my duvet around to make sure it lay flat inside its cover with all four corners aligned.\n\nThis all changed one fateful day in 2015, when I Googled \u201chow to get your duvet to stay in place.\u201d The first result was an Amazon link for some padded clips, which, according to the description, could hold the the duvet and the cover together from the inside. I bought two sets, per the reviews, which suggested putting a clip on each of your duvet\u2019s four corners and four along each of its sides.\n\nWhen they arrived, I put them straight to the test. I flipped the cover inside out and aligned each of the duvet\u2019s four corners with the cover\u2019s four corners. Then I clipped them together as recommended \u2014 one on each of the corners, four along each of the sides. To finish, I turned the cover right-side out and gave the whole thing a robust shake to see if the clips (whose teeth, by the way, are soft, so they won\u2019t damage the fabric) would hold strong. They did.\n\nSince I bought these clips five years ago, my comforter, which used to bunch in the middle practically every night, has stayed perfectly, perpetually aligned with its cover. I\u2019ve accidentally thrown it on the floor in the heat of summer, have wrapped it around myself like a cocoon, and have tossed and turned all night in bed \u2014 no matter, it stays put. This makes sleeping much, much more comfortable (I should mention here that you don\u2019t feel these clips at all unless you\u2019re actively reaching around to make sure they\u2019re still there). I never find myself, as I once did, sleeping underneath just a thin, duvet-less duvet cover. Most important, though, I no longer have to waste time making the lumped-up comforter fill its cover in the morning, which has cut my bed-making time from 10 minutes to two and means my made bed looks especially neat, as if hotel housekeeping stopped by my apartment daily.\n\nAnd because the clips make it so much easier to get the duvet back inside its cover after it has been taken out (a process I used to compare to getting my dog, Marshall, into his doggie tote when he knows he\u2019s going to the groomer), I wash both components more often. After putting my freshly laundered cover back on on a couple of weeks ago, I tucked myself into bed and felt, for a moment, genuine sadness for people who don\u2019t own these weird, little $5 life changers.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
