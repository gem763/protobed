Here's one of them: And here's the other for your viewing pleasure... One hour until the main card.

Here's how it looks: Khabib Nurmagomedov vs Dustin Poirier Edson Barboza vs Paul Felder Islam Makhachev vs Davi Ramos Curtis Blaydes vs Shamil Abdurakhimov Mairbek Taisumov vs Carlos Diego Ferreira So, you're in for a good evening... It seems that ahead of the fight, Khabib might be a little bit agitated. But not with his opponent, for once. The Russian has been asked numerous questions about whether his dad is attending the fight - and he's sick of it. \"How many times will you ask about my father? \"He [another journalist] asked me yesterday about why I didn't come to media. \"I said, 'I come but I don't talk with media.' I come, sit down and leave. \"But why don't I talk with media? Because the last three months, same question. \"Father? What do you think about Dustin? Do you respect him? How is your training camp? \"Like 90 per cent, all the same. \"Right now, same thing. Right now I want to leave they say, 'No you have to go.' \"You guys say 90 per cent the same question. \"How many times do I give answers about my father? Maybe this week 15 or 20. One question.\" For MMA fans in the UK, the preliminary card just ended on a rather positive note! Scotland's Joanne Calderwood earned a massive win in the UFC women's flyweight division, defeating America's Andrea Lee by split decision. It was a closely fought contest, but Jojo came out on top 28-29, 30-27, 29-28. That's three wins from her last four fights. Here we go!

Tonight's main card coverage is underway, sit back and enjoy as we bring you the latest updates from every fight. Advertisement First up is a lightweight bout between Mairbek Taisumov (27-5) and Carlos Diego Ferreira (15-2). It is clearly sweltering in the arena tonight - Taisumov and Ferreira are warming up backstage and they're already drenched in sweat. That heat could play a big part in how tonight's fights play out; draining energy, but also making fighters harder to hold onto when grappling, due to all the sweat. Ring announcer and general icon Bruce Buffer does his thing and the fight is underway! A lively first round, in which Ferreira did all of the pressing. Each man seemed to have the other wobbled at one point or another. Advertisement Both men start the second round by swinging for the fences, before they tie up against the fence. Ferreira is warned by referee Herb Dean for a couple of headbutts as the fighters grapple. They seemed accidental. More pressing from Ferreira. Both fighters have landed some decent strikes and are sporting a bit of blood. Taisumov ends a sharp combination with a tidy hook. Ferreira lands a nice high kick as the round closes, but Taisumov doesn't seem too fazed. The two fighters exchange respect after the buzzer. Ferreira starts the final round with a high pace again, after an emphatic pep talk in his corner. He shoots for a takedown but Taisumov stuffs it well.

I want to stay busy. I want to stay hungry. I want to stay focused, humble. This is the key.\"\n\nNurmagomedov returns to face Poirier (21-5, 1 no-contest), who claimed an interim lightweight title belt during Nurmagomedov's suspension by beating Max Holloway.\n\nUnlike the theatrics around his bout last year with McGregor, Nurmagomedov has a clear mutual respect with Poirier. Instead of a clash of personalities, this fight will be a contrast of style and strengths.\n\n\"My last fight, it was a little bit crazy and tough fight,\" Nurmagomedov said. \"But now I have an opponent I want to show respect to, and it's all about respect. That's why we both show respect. But when the cage closes, it's going to be a very good, high-level matchup.\"", "description": "Khabib Nurmagomedov returned to the\u00a0UFC on Saturday and made a major statement,\u00a0defeating Dustin Poirier to retain his lightweight title at UFC 242\u00a0in Abu Dhabi.
