The Democratic Unionist Party is a small Northern Irish political grouping with an outsized Brexit role. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson most likely needs the 10 votes the party has in Parliament if he is going to have any chance in getting any Brexit deal he negotiates with the European Union over the line. Little wonder then, that the party is being courted intensely by Johnson. As things stand, it\u2019s not clear whether the party will support any deal that emerges.(AP Photo/Francisco Seco, File) Associated Press\n\nBRUSSELS (AP) \u2014 The Latest on Brexit (all times local):\n\n8:10 a.m.\n\nThe leaders of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's key Northern Ireland ally say they can't support the draft Brexit deal struck between the government and the European Union.\n\nSupport from the Democratic Unionist Party is key to Johnson's plan to get an agreement approved by parliament.
