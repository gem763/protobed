REUTERS/Andrew Winning/File Photo\n\nThe talks come amid a slowdown in Britain\u2019s housing market, partly due to uncertainty caused by the country\u2019s departure from the European Union.\n\nBovis (BVS.L) has thrived in the slowing market, thanks to a focus on affordable homes. A deal would allow Galliford, meanwhile, to concentrate on turning round its other construction interests.\n\nEarlier this year, Bovis was in talks to buy Galliford\u2019s Linden Homes and Partnerships & Regeneration divisions for 950 million pounds in shares and the assumption of 100 million pounds in debt, but discussions ended after Galliford said they were not in its shareholders\u2019 interests.\n\nGalliford shares surged more than a quarter in value to a six-month high of 780 pence in early Tuesday trading. Bovis\u2019s shares fell about 4%.\n\nUnder the new proposal, Galliford shareholders would get 0.57406 Bovis shares for each Galliford share they own, implying a value of 675 million pounds, and Galliford would also be paid 300 million pounds in cash.\n\nBovis said it would fund the cash part of the deal from an equity placing, additional debt and existing resources.\n\nGalliford shareholders would own about 29.3% of the enlarged Bovis, while Bovis would also take on Galliford\u2019s 10-year debt worth 100 million pounds.\n\nGalliford\u2019s pension schemes would transfer to Bovis as well.\n\nBovis said significant work was still needed before a definitive deal could be signed, including agreeing on commercial terms, due diligence and arranging funds.\n\nBovis also reported a 20% rise in profit for the six months ended June 30 to 72.4 million pounds, adding it had not seen any significant change in customer behavior ahead of Brexit.\n\nGalliford, which has reduced its exposure to Central London where the housing market slowdown has been most marked, is best known for construction projects ranging from the redevelopment of the Wimbledon tennis venue to hospitals and city bypasses.", "description": "Britain's Galliford Try has restarted talks to sell its residential housing businesses to Bovis Homes after receiving an improved cash and shares proposal worth 1.08 billion pounds ($1.34 billion).", "authors": ["Shashwat Awasthi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428238358&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF890IV", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
