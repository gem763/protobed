People living in areas like this already have little financial means. A shortage of medicine has pushed up prices making it virtually impossible for those in poverty to get access\n\nIt is estimated thousands, in particular those living in poor areas like Petare, Caracas, are at risk of dying as a result of the critical shortage in medicine\n\nAll across Venezuela, but particularly in poor areas like Petare, patients cannot hope to afford the price of medicines that due to the economic crisis, have become exceedingly rare.\n\nAnd so they are looking to alternatives for treatment.\n\nThe small waiting room at the home of self-styled healer 'Brother Guayanes' in Caracas' rundown Petare district fills up quickly with patients - business has never been better.\n\nPatients with little other choice are turning to spiritual healers like Guayanese brother, taking herbs and participating in spiritual rituals in an effort to find a more affordable treatment\n\nGuayanese Brother, whose real name is Carlos Rosales at his clinic in Caracas. He says he is treating an unprecedented amount of patients seeking alternative treatment as a result of the country's shortage of medicine\n\nThe spiritual healer says he performs 200 interventions a week in a dim, candle-lit room that features two camp beds and an array of plaster statues that he says represent 'spiritual entities'\n\nRosa Saez gets treatment at Guayanese Brother's clinic. She says there is nothing left at her local hospital and all other options are too expensive\n\n'We go to the hospital and there's nothing there. They don't have medicines, or they're too expensive, what are we to do?' said Rosa Saez, 77, who has come to get treatment for a painful arm.\n\nCarlos Rosales - he uses the more ceremonious 'Brother Guayanes' for his business - is finishing up a 'spiritual intervention' on a patient in what passes for his surgery.\n\nThe patient lies, eyes closed, on a cot as, in a series of swishes and clicks, the healer waves five pairs of scissors one after another over his prone body.\n\nThe healer says he performs 200 such interventions a week in a dim, candle-lit room that features two camp beds and an array of plaster statues that Rosales says represent 'spiritual entities'.\n\nA regular visitor to the spiritual center, Saez says she has faith in Rosales' methods: 'He healed my kidneys.'\n\nAn altar at the clinic in Petare, where more Venezuelans have been turning to in an effort to find an affordable level of treatment\n\nA crucifix suspended from a chain around the spiritual healer's neck (left) and signs at the door (right) ask clients to arrive with a candle and tobacco\n\nRosales' clinic is muggy with the smell of tobacco. A crucifix suspended from a chain around his neck, he practices a seeming mixture of smoke-blowing shamanism, plant-based medicine and mainstream religion.\n\nPosters hung near the entrance remind clients to arrive with a candle and tobacco and 'Don't forget that payment is in cash'.\n\nMuch like a general practitioner, Rosales spends time consulting with his patients, examining them with a stethoscope, before offering a diagnosis. Often he prescribes potions based on plants and fruit, such as pineapple and a type of local squash known as chayote.\n\n'We know medicines are necessary,' he says. 'I'm not against medicine, but my medicine is botany.'\n\nThe spiritual leader spends time consulting with patients before performing rituals, as above, and prescribing them potions based on plants and fruits. Mr Rosales says medicines are necessary but he provides a different type of medicine based on botanical sources\n\nSome patients have reported the price of medicines have forced them to reduce the amount they buy, supplementing them with herbal infusions and have lead many to seek alternative therapies\n\nAt her stall in a downtown Caracas market, 72-year-old Lilia Reyes says she has seen her trade in medicinal plants flourish.\n\n'I can't keep up with the demand,' she said at her stall, bathed in the aroma of camomile, one of the 150 plants she sells.\n\nCareless consumption of some herbs can be deadly, warns Grismery Morillo. A doctor at a Caracas public hospital, she says she has seen many cases of acute liver failure in people who have eaten certain roots.\n\nBut despite the risks, people like Carmen Teresa say they have no alternative.\n\nIn the kitchen of her restaurant which closed down three years ago as the economic crisis took hold, the 58-year-old Colombian prepares an infusion of fig leaves to treat 'diabetic neuropathy'.\n\nThe painkillers needed for the condition are 'too expensive' and prices are going up due to hyperinflation, so she is cutting back on the pills and supplementing her treatment with herbal infusions.\n\nShe needs at least four tablets a day to keep her diabetes at bay. Her mother, bedridden since breaking a leg a year ago, suffers from Alzheimer's disease and needs five pills a day for hypertension.\n\n'I'm still taking my pills, but I reduced the dose,' says Teresa, who is also replacing cholesterol pills with lemon juice.\n\nVenezuelan Barbara Rojas, 18, is one of those who has turned to alternative medicines as she is unable to afford the high cost of medicine caused by the lack of supply", "description": "The country's pharmacists' federation say pharmacies and hospitals have on average only about 20 per cent of the medicine stock needed.", "authors": ["Corazon Miller For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/11/19437650-0-image-a-36_1570529801019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
