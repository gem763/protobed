It's a challenging camp, challenging offseason and then the coach decides, or the owner decides, or the general manager decides who makes it and who doesn't. Everyone is trying to win games. The NFL is a very competitive landscape. I believe that the owners try to put the best people on the field in order to give their teams the best chance to win.\u201d\n\nThe possibility of Lloyd kicking in the NFL was brought up after she nailed a 55-yarder during an appearance at Philadelphia Eagles training camp.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLloyd, who is coming off a women's World Cup championship win, said she would pursue the league in 2020.", "description": "Six-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback Tom Brady earlier this week tossed his support for U.S. soccer great Carli Lloyd and her ambitions to become a kicker in the NFL.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News.
