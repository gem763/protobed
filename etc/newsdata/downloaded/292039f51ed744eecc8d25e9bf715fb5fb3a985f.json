Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates joined in September.\n\nThe United Kingdom and Australia are the principal Western partners of the US to have agreed to send warships to escort commercial shipping in the Gulf.\n\nMost European states have declined to participate, fearful of undermining their efforts to save the nuclear accord with Iran, which was weakened by the US withdrawal.\n\nIran, which considers itself the guardian of the Gulf, has presented its own regional plan to assure \"energy security\" and \"freedom of navigation\".", "description": "The US formed a naval coalition to protect navigation in a region critical to global oil supplies after tanker attacks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/15/164cf91b0b0746eb92bc8d5e7afc9de7_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
