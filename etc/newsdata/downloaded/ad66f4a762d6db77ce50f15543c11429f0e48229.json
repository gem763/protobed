Just last month following the shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio which left over 30 dead, Mr. Trump called on the Justice Department to propose such legislation, so that those who commit hate crimes and mass murders would face the death penalty \"quickly\" and \"decisively,\" \"without years of delay.\"\n\nMr. Trump referred to the West Texas shooter responsible for the 38th mass shooting this year as \"another very sick person\" and he also expressed some doubt about the efficacy of background checks.\n\n\"If you look at the last four or five, going back even five or six or seven years, for the most part, as strong as you make your background checks, they would not have stopped any of it,\" he told reporters on the White House lawn Sunday. \"So it's a big problem. It's a mental problem.\"\n\nIn El Paso, prosecutors are planning to seek the death penalty for the man suspected of killing 22 people and injuring more than two dozen others at an El Paso Walmart store earlier in August.\n\nU.S. Attorney John Bash announced last month his office would pursue a criminal investigation, a civil rights hate crime investigation and \"domestic terrorism\" charges against the suspect, who was identified as 21-year-old Patrick Crusius.", "description": "The measure is expected to be part of a final gun reform package being proposed by the White House", "authors": ["Emily Tillett", "Emily Tillett Is A Politics Reporter", "Video Editor For Cbs News Digital"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/29/b058b588-bc8f-41fb-8bcc-cca19aaed960/thumbnail/1200x630/5e09a130fdd7ef08151f973dad47a584/2019-03-28t161050z-1003581439-rc16cd3a7b30-rtrmadp-3-usa-court-guns.jpg"}
