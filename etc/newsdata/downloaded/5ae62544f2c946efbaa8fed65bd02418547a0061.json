Its reaction to the North\u2019s recent tests contrasts to the low-key U.S. response.\n\n\u201cTaking into consideration its technological maturity acquired by nuclear tests, North Korea seems to have already achieved miniaturization of warheads to place atop ballistic missiles,\u201d said the report, which last year only mentioned it as a possibility. The North is now aiming to further increase missile ranges, improve accuracy and operational and surprise attack capability and diversify launching methods, it said.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s military activity \u201cstill poses serious and imminent threat\u201d to Japan\u2019s security as well as international peace and safety.\n\nSince the second U.S.-North Korea summit collapsed this year, North Korea has fired 10 short-range missiles and projectiles deemed new and upgraded.\n\nCiting its analysis, the Defense Ministry said they were three new types, including one resembling Russia\u2019s Iskander, and flight distances ranging from 200 kilometers (124 miles) to 600 km (370 miles). It said the missiles were new and their capability upgraded, and that Japan needs to further strengthen its missile defenses.\n\nNorth Korean missiles within those flight ranges could strike targets in Japan and South Korea but not the U.S., which has been the basis for the low-key Trump administration reaction.\n\nJapan\u2019s defense report also noted China\u2019s threat is expanding into space from the regional seas, saying Japan must prioritize space security.\n\nJapan has been bolstering its defense role under its alliance with the U.S. and is now launching a space unit and measures against cyber and electromagnetic attacks.\n\nWhile many countries are developing their capabilities to ensure their military superiority, China and Russia have been enhancing capabilities to \u201cimpede the U.S. and its allies from using outer space,\u201d the report said. It said China and Russia are developing missiles and satellites to destroy satellites or interfere with their communication with the ground. \u201cThreats to stable use of the space are intensifying,\u201d it said.\n\nEven though Japan and South Korea are U.S. allies who face shared threats, the defense report gave South Korea a relegated position. Their relations deteriorated rapidly since July over wartime history and export controls that spilled over to defense, prompting Seoul to announce in late August it would terminate a bilateral military intelligence pact. In the report, Japan urged Seoul to \u201cwisely respond to secure appropriate cooperation between Japan and South Korea, and among Japan, the U.S. and South Korea.\u201d\n\nThe intelligence sharing pact had symbolized the countries\u2019 three-way security cooperation countering North Korea and China.\n\nJapan\u2019s Maritime Self-Defense Force, citing the recent tensions, said it is not inviting South Korea to an international navy review Japan hosts next month.\n\n___\n\nFollow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Japan raised its caution level about North Korea's missile capability, saying in a defense report that the country resumed missile tests while taking no concrete denuclearization steps and had succeeded in making miniaturized warheads.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mari Yamaguchi"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/japan_defense_paper_67237_c0-125-3000-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?f52fad753beb582a85b1710fc9f6c2ec1ddbd99f", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
