Employing the same open borders rationale as O\u2019Rourke, judges, policymakers and activists ensured that he was never deported.\n\nSince my son\u2019s death, I\u2019ve fought to change the policies that enabled it \u2014 to get our elected officials to secure the border and remove people who have no right to be here, especially convicted criminals.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke has made it clear he wants the opposite. He wants us to believe that enforcing immigration law is tantamount to killing kids.\n\nThat\u2019s a slap in the face not just to legal immigrants, but to everyone who has suffered from the sort of weak immigration enforcement that O\u2019Rourke desires.", "description": "", "authors": ["Mary Ann Mendoza", "Usatoday.Com Story Opinion Beto-Orourke-Immigration-Open-Borders-Angel-Mom-Column"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
