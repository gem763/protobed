Lorenzo gives his locks for the weekend. USA TODAY\n\nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. - No Saquon Barkley. No Sterling Shepard. No Evan Engram. No Wayne Gallman.\n\nNo chance? Well, the short-handed Giants hung in there with the Patriots, trading splash plays and fighting through growing pains for their rookie quarterback.\n\nIn the end, Daniel came up short in the effort to knock out Goliath - Daniel Jones, that is, and the Giants' upset bid was denied by Tom Brady and the Patriots on Thursday night.\n\nThe Giants (2-4) won't be looking for moral victories following the 35-14 defeat to the defending Super Bowl champions, and Jones had his share of struggles against the No. 1 defense in the league. By the time Brady scored his second touchdown on a sneak, the scoreboard revealed an outcome that was for many a foregone conclusion.\n\nHow the Giants and the Patriots got there, with Big Blue down one score with nine minutes left in the fourth quarter, is what the former needs to find a way to build on.\n\nConsidering they faced the largest point spread against them since 1970 and perhaps longer (16.5 points), the Giants defied odds to keep things interesting, albeit failing to make enough plays down the stretch to truly threaten the final result.\n\nThe Patriots (6-0) remain undefeated and they picked off Jones three times, scoring a touchdown on special teams and on defense. The Giants have a lot to learn from after this one, but an overall effort - especially defensively - that could pay dividends down the road if it becomes a jumping-off point to bigger things.", "description": "The Patriots' defense repeatedly flustered rookie QB Daniel Jones and helped New England break away from the Giants on Thursday.", "authors": ["Art Stapleton", "Published P.M.
