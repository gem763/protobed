The German brand is beloved among artists and graphic designers and came recommended by three people we spoke with. It was officially founded in 1835, but its roots go back to a circa-1662 item in the Nuremburg city annals that references a pencil craftsman named Friedrich Staedtler. Needless to say, the company has had a while to perfect its craft, which shows in its offerings (its range of lead grades, for example, is wider than most other pencil makers\u2019). Staedtler offers leads from 12B to 10H, with B indicating the graphite\u2019s level of blackness or softness, and H indicating the level of hardness. The higher the number, the softer or harder the lead will be. (Hard leads make cleaner lines that are less susceptible to smudging; soft leads create richer, heavier lines.)\n\nJoshua Abelow, who uses pencils on soft paper to create large line drawings (that he never revises or erases), says he\u2019s been using Staedtler\u2019s 6B Mars Lumograph pencils exclusively since 2004. \u201cI like the 6B because it\u2019s soft enough to produce a wide variety of marks depending on the speed and pressure I apply.\u201d Andrew Kuo and Sebastian Black, both painters, say they also prefer Staedtler. Kuo uses HB Staedtler pencils exclusively (HB, which is the midway point of lead rangers, stands for hard and black), while Black says that he regularly uses both HB and 2B. This set of six Mars Lumograph pencils includes a range of lead degrees, from HB to 8B, so you can test all three of the artist\u2019s favorite leads.", "description": "We asked 12 professional artists about the pencils they use for sketching, doodling, laying out, and putting the finishing touches on their artwork.
