It adds that \u201coverweight and obesity continue to rise.\u201d\n\nFore said millions of children eat an unhealthy diet because they don\u2019t have a choice.\n\n\u201cThe way we understand and respond to malnutrition needs to change,\u201d Fore said. \u201cIt is not just about getting children enough to eat, it is above all about getting them the right food to eat. That is our common challenge today.\u201d\n\nUNICEF says \u201cfinancial incentives\u201d should reward the increase of healthy and affordable foods. It says \u201cfinancial disincentives\u201d on unhealthy foods can help improve children\u2019s diets.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nUNICEF report: https://features.unicef.org/state-of-the-worlds-children-2019-nutrition\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "One-third of children worldwide under age 5 - about 200 million youngsters - are either undernourished or overweight, undermining their full potential to grow and develop, the U.N. children's agency said in a report Tuesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
