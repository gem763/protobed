Californians make up 12 percent of the population of the entire US. In fact, California\u2019s economy is worth $2.7 trillion. That makes it the fifth-largest economy in the world \u2014 right after Germany and before the United Kingdom.\n\nOkay, that\u2019s interesting and all, by why exactly, are we telling you all these fun California facts?\n\nBecause they illustrate that, like it or not, there\u2019s almost no US (and maybe even international!) business that can guarantee it doesn\u2019t \u2014 or won\u2019t \u2014 collect data from a Californian consumer. And that\u2019s going to matter big time when the California Consumer Privacy Act goes into full effect in 2020.\n\nSo keep reading for a quick primer on everything you must know about this new law and what you can do right now to ensure your business \u2014 no matter where it\u2019s located \u2014 is prepared to stay compliant without any scary fines or costly disruptions.\n\nEverything you need to know: The California Consumer Privacy Act\n\nExpected to go into effect January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) was created with much the same goal as the EU\u2019s famous General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) \u2014 to update the way businesses collect information about private (and, in this case, California-based) citizens in the internet age.\n\nIn short, the CCPA empowers Californian consumers with the right to:\n\nKnow what pieces personal data a business has collected\n\nKnow if their personal information is being sold or disclosed \u2014 and to whom\n\nKnow with whom their personal information is being shared\n\nDeny the sharing of their information\n\nAccess their personal information\n\nReceive the same pricing and service across the board \u2014 whether they\u2019ve exercised any of these privacy rights or not\n\n\n\nWho will the CCPA affect when it comes to businesses? Legal, for-profit entities that operate in California and collect consumers\u2019 personal information will be responsible for complying to the CCPA if they meet any of these stipulations:\n\nHave an annual gross revenue that totals $25 million or higher\n\nBuy, receive, sell, or share consumer data from 50,000 or more consumers, households, or devices\n\nMake the majority of their annual revenue from selling personal data\n\nAnd what if these businesses aren\u2019t all queued up to comply by January 2020? Well, then California citizens \u2014 as well as the state itself \u2014 will be entitled to sue any company that violates their rights under the law. Aside from the associated legal fees, businesses could suffer $7,500 fines for each violation that hasn\u2019t been addressed after just 30 days.\n\nHowever, legal action, fines, and even a poor reputation aren\u2019t the only reasons marketers and businesses alike can\u2019t afford to ignore the CCPA.\n\nWhy you should care: The CCPA is just the tip of the iceberg of new data legislation\n\nToday, nearly every enterprise marketing team uses consumer data to create personalized digital experiences, develop smarter analytics, inform segmentation, produce effective email marketing campaigns, and do tons of other awesome things that ultimately fuel the growth and success of their organizations.\n\nSo it\u2019s pretty safe to say that the CCPA is going to have a huge impact on marketing teams and businesses as a whole if they aren\u2019t compliant by the time 2020 rolls around.\n\nIn addition to it being a major challenge of reimagining years or even decades of marketing methods, the CCPA is also a sign of more changes to come.\n\nData-driven organizations, websites, and marketers everywhere must sit up and take note \u2014 governments are taking action when it comes to safeguarding their constituents\u2019 online information. California wasn\u2019t the first to crack down and it certainly won\u2019t be the last.\n\nBusinesses that want to mitigate risk, minimize disruption, and get ahead in the post-anything-goes digital age need to tighten up their practices when it comes to gathering and storing consumer information \u2014 and quickly!\n\nLet\u2019s hop right in to one innovative compliance solution that goes straight to the heart of your business\u2019 digital experience.\n\nHow to get compliant with the CCPA: It all starts with your content management system\n\nContent is the life blood of the digital experience that your business relies upon to attract leads, educate consumers, and generate revenue \u2014 and your content management system (CMS) is the heart that keeps it all going.\n\nThat\u2019s why I recommend starting your campaign for CCPA compliance with your CMS and letting your entire tech stack follow suit.\n\nWith these key features, your CMS will help prepare your marketing team and your company as a whole for the CCPA as well as whatever other privacy regulations come your way.\n\nAutomated consent management and validation\n\nWhat has come to be known as bundled (or single) consent will not be enough under the CCPA. Your CMS should be able to display unique consent forms for each instance in which you plan to gather personal information.\n\nIn addition, it would save you a ton of time and headache if your CMS could also automatically recognize when consent still needs to be collected as soon as a consumer lands in a new data-gathering situation.\n\nAs for validation, look for a CMS that can be configured to automatically send a secondary opt-in via email. A commitment to thorough validation will go a long way toward keeping your business on the right side of the law.\n\nEasily-accessed and adjustable consumer profiles and consent records\n\nThe CCPA doesn\u2019t leave a lot of leeway when it comes to responding to violation claims \u2014 businesses have just 30 days before a $7,500 fine can be levied. Because of this threat, it\u2019s key that your CMS be fully capable of integrating with customer relationship management (CRM) software where consumer data is both safe and accessible.\n\nThat way, should a consumer request to access, remove, or even port over their personal information that you have on file, you\u2019ll be able to make quick work of tracking down and sharing that info \u2014 complete with a history of their consents.\n\nA rigorous \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d workflow\n\nA consumer\u2019s \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d means they can request that you remove their personal data from your system \u2014 no matter how many different places that data may exist.\n\nBecause of this, you\u2019ll want your CMS to be constantly tracking where all the pertinent data associated with a single user lives so that you can find and remove it during the allotted time frame.\n\nAnd for good measure, you can also integrate alerts that inform third parties with whom you\u2019ve shared this specific information so they can choose how to comply with the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d request.\n\nThorough permissions settings\n\nSince privacy and security are kind of the overarching goal when we talk about consumer data under the CCPA, we think it\u2019s pretty key that your CMS has permission controls that keep thorough track of exactly who within your business is able to access your customers\u2019 personal information.\n\nOverall adaptable and extensible architecture\n\nAt the end of the day, there are countless ways to go about complying with the CCPA and other data privacy laws on the horizon. So, perhaps the most important CMS feature of all is a flexible, customizable architecture.\n\nLearn more: Keep your business flexible as the CCPA and other data privacy laws continue to develop\n\nWhether you\u2019re researching how to get ready for the CCPA, catching up with GDPR, or just setting yourself up for success in the changing future of digital data privacy regulation (smart!); building your consumer experience on a flexible foundation is sure to be one of the best ways to stay legal, fine-free, and on-track no matter what comes your way.", "description": "Were you unprepared for GDPR?
