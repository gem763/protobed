The pair had appeared on so many grocery-store tabloid covers that this information had to be taken for gospel.\n\nBut then, in one of the hottest weeks of the year in Toronto, the pair were photographed outside a since-closed restaurant near McAdams\u2019s home, doing something that, for what is possibly the first time in history, could accurately be described as \u201ccanoodling.\u201d\n\nHe was wearing a black tee and dark pants; she a hastily tucked white button-down, one shoulder gently snaking downward to reveal a Jane Austen\u2013level peek of collarbone. Both appeared \u2026 rumpled. In other words, they were sexily disheveled and a little bit dirty. In other words, they had clearly wandered over to the diner after a few days off spent fucking.\n\nGazing at these photos feels like walking into my college apartment and smelling the specific humidity of fresh sex, knowing my roommate just hooked up with her stoner boyfriend on the couch. The images capture a moment that is brazen in its carefree, candid nature.\n\nThere they are, interrupting their own meal to lean closer and closer, grinning in each other\u2019s faces with the kind of intensity that reads as sheer romance. Then there\u2019s another shot of them, sipping their straws in unison, rarely breaking eye contact, like an audition for a live-action, uncensored Lady and the Tramp.\n\nAnd yet another burst of photos reveals that Rachel spent much of the breakfast in Ryan\u2019s lap, shoes off, bare feet dangling in the summer air, his hand comfortably resting below her waist, both slathering each other\u2019s faces in equal amounts of feathery-light pecks, lip-chews, and smacks. It feels obvious to me from these photos that Ryan likely used Rachel\u2019s toothbrush before they left for their outing, if they even bothered to brush at all.\n\nBut then, then, the moment that almost makes me feel like I should cover my eyes: Rachel hand-feeding Ryan a pastry of some kind, both chewing in harmony, their hunger ceaseless. The two of them smooch away each other\u2019s worries. Her brow is unfurrowed, her hairband is loosened. They look like the rest of the world doesn\u2019t exist to them and, frankly, I wish I had pearls I could clutch!\n\nHad I simply been in too long a dry spell, or was this actually the hottest PDA session ever captured by the paparazzi? It felt so intimate, and it made me believe in true love and great sex like no Nicholas Sparks film had before or since. This wasn\u2019t just some random candid moment between a couple, but a page from a real-life notebook of love.\n\nIt is a truth firmly established that Ryan and Rachel were and continued to be after this errant moment one of the more private couples in Hollywood, further enchanting this memory. It was unclear when they were together and when they weren\u2019t. Except for this literally steamy weekend, so entrenched in love and lust were they that the rest of the world and its cameras were all but forgotten.", "description": "I think about these pictures of Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams a lot.
