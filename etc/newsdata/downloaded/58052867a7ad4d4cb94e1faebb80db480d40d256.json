The 20-day limit stems from a 2017 decision in the Flores case, by Judge Dolly Gee, who still oversees the case in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nMyra Jones-Taylor, chief policy officer at the child-development advocacy group Zero to Three, one of the organizations filing the brief, said in a statement to CBS News that \"even under the best circumstances, and even with their families, placing infants and toddlers in detention centers is not an acceptable option.\"\n\n\"Babies do not belong in detention. There is no simpler way to put it. For these young children, the rollback of the Flores Settlement Agreement paves the way for spending a significant time in family detention during a critical developmental period,\" Jones-Taylor said.\n\nThe brief accuses the government of a \"manifest intent ... to detain children indefinitely.\"\n\nIt's a contention that was disputed by Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan during an August 21 press conference announcing the regulation. McAleenan said there is \"no intent\" to hold families for \"a very long time,\" and suggested families would be in custody for an average of about 50 days.\n\nThe brief also criticizes a plan included in the regulation that would create an internal judicial system that would eliminate the role of immigration judges in evaluating whether kids are too dangerous, or too likely to flee, to be released.\n\nThe organizations argue in the brief that the new system of so-called 810 Hearings will prevent children from participating \"meaningfully\" in their own defense.\n\nJudge Gee is expected to receive filings about the regulation from both the government and lawyers for the nation's unaccompanied minors late Friday. She has not yet set a date to rule on the regulation.", "description": "The organizations, which include the American Academy of Pediatrics, say a new federal rule would harm migrant children and deprive them of certain rights", "authors": ["Graham Kates", "Graham Kates Is An Investigative Reporter Covering Criminal Justice", "Privacy Issues", "Information Security For Cbsnews.Com."], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/06/28/abb33b8e-e032-4518-947d-c9c41f8788d2/thumbnail/1200x630/63e51f5efdd02ada3068394c84fa3849/gettyimages-1152521078.jpg"}
