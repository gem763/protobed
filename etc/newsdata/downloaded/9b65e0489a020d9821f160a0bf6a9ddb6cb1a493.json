You must be despondent about originalism?\u2019 I get that question a lot. Gosh, you\u2019ve got to live my life!\u201d\n\nIn law school, he tells me, \u201cI didn\u2019t have a professor who uttered the word. At Harvard Law School. I think I first heard the word from Antonin Scalia when he was a youngish justice, about the age I am now, visiting for a lecture that he gave.\u201d Back then, so outr\u00e9 was the philosophy deemed to be \u201cthat the Harvard Law Review wouldn\u2019t publish\u201d Scalia\u2019s speech; \u201cit had to be published by the University of Chicago.\u201d But today? \u201cToday, we\u2019ve come from that to the point at which an originalist can stand before the American people and the Senate Judiciary Committee and say, \u2018I\u2019m an originalist, and I\u2019m proud to be one, and I\u2019m happy to discuss it with you.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJustice Gorsuch\u2019s animating conviction is that judges are there to understand and to enforce the Constitution as it was understood at the time of ratification, rather than to read their own views \u2014 or the views that they imagine are held by a majority of the citizenry \u2014 into the text. Or, put another way, Justice Gorsuch believes that the Constitution is a legal contract, rather than a vague and protean guidebook that should be interpreted and altered by a revising committee responsive to the democratic passions of the day. \u201cWhen we depart from the original meaning of the Constitution and hand it over to judges,\u201d he proposes, \u201cwe weaken our habit of self-government and we atrophy a muscle that Madison wanted us to exercise. It used to be that we had an amendment every ten or so years. We haven\u2019t had an amendment since 1992. The amendments have dropped off in number since about the same time as the rise of \u2018living constitutionalism.\u2019 I don\u2019t know if one can say that\u2019s purely an accident or coincidence.\u201d\n\nEither way, Justice Gorsuch will not be helping to amend that Constitution himself. \u201cThe whole point\u201d of his branch, he says, is to \u201cuphold the Constitution and laws even \u2014 and especially \u2014 when they are unpopular. It would be easy for a judge to uphold the Constitution and laws when it\u2019s popular. You wouldn\u2019t need a judge for that. You can just get a legislator or politician to do that. The whole point of a judge is to take the slings and arrows \u2014 is to be unpopular a lot of the time. That\u2019s my job.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt times, Gorsuch seems surprised by how that job is imagined by the other branches, and by the press. \u201cI lived a very anonymous and happy life in Colorado,\u201d he recalls, \u201cwhere it felt as if the rule of law was everywhere around me and everyone understood it. And then I go through the confirmation process, and I lose my anonymity and people say all sorts of things that were quite surprising to me.\u201d For example? \u201cThe suggestion that if I ruled a way in one case, against somebody, I must dislike that entire class of persons, all while ignoring that as a judge who has decided thousands of cases, I\u2019ve ruled for that same class of person in other cases based on different facts of a different law. That people would utter such things, and maybe even believe them, really was a shock to me.\u201d Such entreaties, he argues, are anathema to the rule of the law and to the protection of minority rights. \u201cEverybody who tells me, \u2018Rule for this group or that group,\u2019 or \u2018You should like these people or that outcome,\u2019 I wonder how they\u2019d feel when they\u2019re unpopular, when they\u2019ve got but one lawyer on their side, and they have the law on their side, but not the mob. Where are they going to hide then?\u201d\n\nThis theme, of the importance of protecting minority rights, is one that comes up frequently. And, in Gorsuch\u2019s view, there is no better mechanism for that protection than the separation of powers. \u201cThis was the Madisonian insight,\u201d he contends: \u201cthat you can make all sorts of promises on a piece of paper, and call it a \u2018bill of rights,\u2019 and it\u2019s not worth the paper it\u2019s written on unless you have some means to enforce it. Like any good contract, it\u2019s only worth the enforcement mechanism it stands on. A lot of countries have bills of rights. In [my new] book, I talk about North Korea\u2019s. It\u2019s great! It\u2019s got everything you want. My favorite is the \u2018right to relaxation.\u2019 I want that! It sounds great. But when power is all concentrated in one hand, it\u2019s meaningless. It\u2019s only as good as the whims of the dictator, the king.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf particular concern is the delegation of legislative power to the executive branch \u2014 a development that trades a \u201cvery public, very raucous process\u201d in which \u201cminority rights . . . play a special role\u201d for \u201clawmaking by one person.\u201d The U.S. Constitution, he explains, \u201cput the legislative power in a branch full of all sorts of checks and balances within itself. Two houses, responsive to different electorates at different times, have to concur, and then get the president\u2019s agreement, or override his veto. . . . Forget about the Senate rules! That alone puts minorities at the fulcrum of power. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to protect your rights at the end of the day: the vulnerable, the unpopular, the pariah.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat happens if this system is bypassed? \u201cYou\u2019ve bought yourself a king. Or maybe worse yet: What if the president can\u2019t even control the executive-branch official? You\u2019ve bought yourself an unelected king \u2014 an unresponsive-to-anybody king, who may be subject to capture, because, as you know, federal agencies can be captured by those they regulate. . . . What happens to the average person? They can\u2019t capture the agency. So you wind up with an awful lot of law, and some of it protects interests that don\u2019t need protection, and makes life particularly difficult for the people who can\u2019t protect themselves on K Street.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen this delegation of power is combined with laws that are sufficiently vague as to permit those agencies to fill in the blanks, and with a judiciary that is overly deferential to that blank-filling, the threat to liberty becomes obvious \u2014 especially when the rules change so frequently that it is hard for even the most diligent citizens to comply. \u201cMadison recognized that if you don\u2019t have written law, that\u2019s an invitation to tyranny,\u201d Gorsuch tells me. \u201cThe law is just whatever the king wants. If you have too much written law, you have a similar problem: a paper blizzard, so that nobody can be sure what their rights are. I wonder if, sometimes, we may be getting there.\u201d\n\nAmong his other worries, Gorsuch lists \u201caccess to justice\u201d (\u201cHow come,\u201d he asks, \u201clawyers are so darned expensive and it takes so long to get to trial?\u201d); that \u201cit seems like everything under the law is a federal crime, and the prosecutor can pick his crime, and pick his defendant\u201d; the state of \u201ccivic education\u201d; and \u201chow we interact with one another\u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a little raucous,\u201d he suggests, including himself in the criticism, \u201cbut I worry about how we treat one another\u201d). He is keen to add that \u201cat the end of the day none of [the worries] overcome my fundamental optimism about the country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving observed the way he talks about the Constitution, I suggest that, while he clearly feels duty-bound to uphold the document as written, irrespective of how it tallies with his personal views, he also loves it. He agrees. \u201cSomething magical happened in all of human history when our founders got together and put together this document,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s perfect, or was when it was written. It\u2019s stood 27 improvements over the years, including extending the franchise and liberty to other groups that were not accounted for in the original Constitution. But I do think that something magical happened when our founders gathered.\u201d\n\nThat magic, Gorsuch suggests, should be carefully protected. \u201cWe didn\u2019t write much down,\u201d he notes. \u201cBut what we wrote down was terribly important. I think that\u2019s exactly what a constitution should be. People who fight against the original meaning of the Constitution, I think, sometimes have less of a beef with originalism, frankly, than they do with what\u2019s in, and what\u2019s missing from, this constitution, and want to amend, maybe, in ways that the document doesn\u2019t provide for.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI ask whether Americans still instinctively understand what a magnificent document they have inherited, and Gorsuch suggests that they do. Nevertheless, he seems slightly perturbed by our cultural tendency toward equivocation. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to sound Polyannaish,\u201d he submits, \u201cbut I hear a lot of people tell me that they are \u2018citizens of the world,\u2019 and I really don\u2019t know what that means. If they\u2019re trying to tell me that they love each person and respect the dignity and worth of each individual, I\u2019m all in. But if they\u2019re saying that there is nothing special about the United States of America and the democracy they live in . . . About 30 percent of them say that it\u2019s important to live in a democracy today, and I say, \u2018Oh my goodness, I wish you\u2019d think again.\u2019 It\u2019s unbelievably low; it used to be 70 or 80 percent, not long ago, and it\u2019s now 30 percent. Those kinds of numbers are shocking to me.\u201d\n\nWith the Court currently in the crosshairs, I wonder aloud whether he reads his own press, particularly that which criticizes him personally. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cWell, rarely. I try to read as little of that as I can get away with. I\u2019m not going to deny mixed motives here, but the primary motive is, as a simple fact of life, I read stacks and stacks of briefs. For each case I read several feet of briefs, and then I have to read the cases in the record. I like to read a novel when I go home to bed. A good book.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat lasts,\u201d he says, \u201cis the work you do; what we put in the books. I\u2019ve been given life tenure. Not for my comfort. I\u2019m here to do a job.\u201d\n\nAnd that is exactly what he intends to do \u2014 irrespective of the \u201cslings and arrows,\u201d without reference to those who would have him \u201cmake things up,\u201d and with a healthy respect for the \u201cspark of genius\u201d that informed the authors of the Constitution. This approach, which he shares with the man who once held his office, guarantees no specific results beyond a role well played. \u201cIt may not be,\u201d he tells me with a smile as I get up to leave, \u201cthat every one of my colleagues will always make an originalist argument. But they\u2019re always, as long as I\u2019m here, going to have to respond to one.\u201d\n\nThis article appears as \u201c\u2018To Take the Slings and Arrows\u2019\u201d in the October 28, 2019, print edition of National Review.", "description": "\u2018To take the slings and arrows.\u2019", "authors": ["Charles C.
