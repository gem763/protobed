He missed all international rugby in 2018 and feared for his life, not just his career, while having to undergo emergency surgery and months of chemotherapy.\n\n\u201cI was given the news at 9.45 a.m., and had surgery at 2 p.m.,\u201d he said.\n\nAt times during that grueling chemotherapy last year, Manu was too sick to walk up the steps at a stadium to watch his teammates at Italian club Benetton Treviso, let alone run out onto the field for a rugby test.\n\nBut he\u2019s likely to run on for a game again after being selected on the bench for Tonga\u2019s World Cup opener in Japan.\n\nIt all struck home for Manu at a World Cup welcoming ceremony for the Tongan team in Sapporo this week.\n\n\u201cI had tears,\u201d he said in an interview for the official Rugby World Cup website. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody knows just how much I have been through to get here. Not only the surgery and chemotherapy, but also the physical battle to get myself in good enough shape.\u201d\n\nManu\u2019s most inspiring moment, he said, was when he was just strong enough to attend a Benetton game and went to meet his teammates in the dressing room afterward. They had all shaved their hair in support of him through his treatment.\n\n\u201cI was at a pretty low point when I was sent the clip of shaved heads. When I was able to attend a game, I was still pretty sick. I went in the dressing room afterwards and that\u2019s a special moment I will always remember.\u201d\n\nDuring the treatment, his rugby career faded.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to know if I\u2019d be able to have more kids and be a good father to the one I had,\u201d he said.\n\nManu took heart from the support of his Benetton teammates, and from former New Zealand flyhalf Aaron Cruden, who was diagnosed with testicular cancer when he was 19 and recovered to play 50 tests for the All Blacks.\n\n\u201cHe gave me hope,\u201d Manu said of Cruden.\n\nBut even after coming through the chemotherapy, Manu\u2019s return for Tonga still had to wait.\n\nHe was named as captain for the team\u2019s first game at this year\u2019s Pacific Nations Cup - the stage was set for his emotional return - only for him to tear a chest muscle at a gym session and be ruled out of the tournament.\n\nSurely this time he\u2019ll get on the field at the Sapporo Dome.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to think that far ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cThere would probably be more (tears), but I hope not. I need to tackle some big men and crying might come across as a sign of weakness.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "No matter the score, if Nasi Manu gets on the field for Tonga in the Rugby World Cup game against England on Sunday it'll be a triumph.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gerald Imray"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/20/tonga_manu_rugby_48833_c0-117-2812-1756_s1770x1032.jpg?618be40cd2fdbb07ec4f6e528008d25459c69b3c", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
