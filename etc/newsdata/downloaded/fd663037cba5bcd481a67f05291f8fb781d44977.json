Whether they\u2019re in a homework planner at school or on a sticky note on a desk at work, to-do lists are an easy way to lay out what has to be done. But how do you avoid the chaos of dozens of little pieces of paper or a digital document that requires endless scrolling? We spoke with experts to find out how to make to-do lists that will help you efficiently accomplish tasks so you have time for activities you really want to do.\n\n[A journey through the fancy planners that promise to fix our broken, millennial lives]\n\nStick to a simple method\n\nThe purpose of creating lists and organizing systems shouldn\u2019t be to create extra work, said Julie Morgenstern, a New York productivity consultant and author of \u201cOrganizing from the Inside Out.\u201d\n\nA color-coordinated list with stickers and extras could work well for one person but might be distracting to someone else. Someone may find comfort in an Excel spreadsheet, but it may cause stress to others. The method doesn\u2019t matter as much as its usefulness. \u201cYou want to use a list as an asset, not as a way to delay doing what\u2019s on the list,\u201d said Stephanie Shalofsky, founder of the Organizing Zone in New York.\n\nIn terms of where you do the organizing, Morgenstern said it\u2019s totally up to you. Test out different approaches, but stick with something you\u2019ll use consistently. For people who are more tactile and visual, she said, a paper planner or notepad is a good place to start. She likes the Inkwell Press planner with daily inserts because \u201cit\u2019s graceful and accommodates strategic planning.\u201d Starter bundles begin at $52. The Organized Chaos Medium Spiral Planner ($14.99, Orange Circle Studio) is Morgenstern\u2019s pick for people looking to build new habits (it includes tools to chart goal progress and water intake).\n\nDigital methods might make more sense for people who need remote access to their lists, who are planning for others who need access or who are agile with computers, Morgenstern said. Any digital system needs to integrate with your calendar, she added. She likes the Remember the Milk app, which asks users how long each task will take.\n\nRashelle Isip, a professional organizer and founder of the Order Expert, keeps a paper pad for personal tasks and keeps work tasks on a digital list to create separation.\n\nBut Shalofsky, who honed her organizing skills working in the entertainment industry, is a proponent of using one medium so nothing gets misplaced or forgotten. \u201cThere are so many ways that tasks can overwhelm us, but once you have it all in one place, it becomes the best starting point for getting them done,\u201d she said. If you\u2019re using Evernote (a sort of digital filing cabinet) or compiling everything into a Google document, she said to routinely take 10 minutes to transfer any paper notes to the platform so you\u2019re not looking in several places. Shalofsky uses Outlook\u2019s task feature to create immediate and longer-term tasks that are stored in a master folder she can add to and reference later.\n\nAlong with Evernote, she said Todoist and Wunderlist are popular digital choices.\n\nCategorize and prioritize\n\nIf you\u2019re just starting to get serious about your organization game, Ellen Faye, a strategic planning and productivity coach, recommends beginning with a simple methodology that you can easily add to as you get busier. Don\u2019t bother putting down tasks that are automated, such as brushing your teeth. \u201cSome people say to write everything down, but not everything needs to go on the list,\u201d Faye said. You can start by writing everything down, she said, and then winnow. In her practice and in her personal life, she separates what she wants to accomplish into four categories based on the task\u2019s urgency and value:\n\n1. Critical: Whatever needs to be done right away \u2014 for example, if rent is due today.\n\n2. Hot: Tasks that have to be done in the next two or three days.\n\n3. Sooner: Everything else needs to be done soon but can wait until after the previous two categories are done.\n\n4. Later: Something you need to finish that doesn\u2019t fit into the above categories.\n\nFaye uses a notepad that she divides into four quadrants, one each for \u201cpersonal,\u201d \u201cwork,\u201d \u201cself care\u201d and \u201cpersonal growth,\u201d and prioritizes tasks using the above categories. If an item remains on your list for a while without being completed, she says, take some time to reflect on why and decide whether it\u2019s something you can get away with not doing.\n\nWhen you\u2019re laying out your tasks, think realistically about how long each one will take and assign a time to it. (For example: Filling out a job application could take five minutes, but it\u2019ll take considerably longer if you have yet to write a cover letter you have to attach.) \u201cThe biggest mistake people make is not asking how long things take,\u201d Morgenstern said. \u201cIf you start asking how long and get good at answering that question, then you\u2019re in a position to evaluate if that thing is worth your time.\u201d This isn\u2019t to say that time-consuming tasks aren\u2019t worth completing \u2014 in some cases, they might be mandatory \u2014 but you\u2019re more likely to get them done if you know what you\u2019re dealing with. Breaking the list into smaller steps gives you a clearer picture of what needs to be done.\n\nTasks vs. goals\n\nIt\u2019s fine to put \u201clearn cello\u201d on a list, but without an action, that directive isn\u2019t helpful, said Liz Sumner, an American life coach in Italy. Instead of jamming numerous vague goals into your day-to-day, Sumner recommends creating some time in your schedule to think about what you want in the longer term, whether that\u2019s a week, a month or a year. Breaking down larger goals into manageable pieces can be done by assigning small tasks. To make \u201clearn cello\u201d into something actionable, start with something such as \u201cresearch cello rentals\u201d or \u201corder cello music book.\u201d Framing tasks in this way helps you allocate time and energy and can also be helpful when evaluating what is worth your time.\n\nIt's the system \u2014 not you\n\nThe measure of whether an organizing system works is whether you\u2019re accomplishing the tasks you need to do and finding time to do activities that make you happy. The goal, Sumner said, is to achieve a balance across the different areas of your life.\n\nA key reminder Sumner gives her clients is to try to approach tasks with enthusiasm and patience and to remember that not every method works for everyone. Instead of focusing on what you didn\u2019t do, try to celebrate the tasks you did complete \u2014 and think about how those will help in the short and long term.\n\nDrumming up enthusiasm to accomplish even mundane tasks is half the battle, she said. Tying consequences and rewards to tasks helps them get done. \u201cThink about the reasoning behind it and ask \u2018how can I find the \u201cI want to\u201d in that task,\u2019 \u201d she said. For example, Sumner recently obtained an Italian driver\u2019s license after several less-than-fun visits to the Italian equivalent of the DMV. Her motivation was being able to drive in her new home country, and she used that to propel her through steps such as making time to study for the test (which was given in Italian) and booking appointments.\n\nIf items are left undone, and your list is falling by the wayside, set aside time to check in with yourself to evaluate what\u2019s not working. Is it too complex, or is it so simple that you\u2019re forgetting basic tasks? Perhaps you don\u2019t like the system or the medium you\u2019re using. A refresh could get you back on track.\n\nDifferent methods work for different periods of life, too, Isip said. \u201cA to-do list is a snapshot of a moment in time,\u201d Isip said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for people to understand that over time, lists will change and the types of items might not be the same.\u201d Use your list as a guide, don\u2019t feel beholden to it, and leave room for fun and relaxation.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t try to fill every micro-moment with something to do,\u201d she said.", "description": "How to turn goals into actions and chores into accomplishments.", "authors": ["Helen Carefoot", "September At Am", "Helen Carefoot Is A Writer", "Editorial Aide For The Washington Post'S Features Section.
