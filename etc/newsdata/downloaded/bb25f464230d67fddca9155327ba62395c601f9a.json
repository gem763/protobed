He just made a silly mistake and I don't think the punishment fits the crime. Twelve-month ban for that?

Property prices began falling in mid-last year but over the past five years prices have risen about 70 per cent.\n\nSmith also owns a 10 per cent stake in Koala, an online furniture business he invested in about three years ago as he searched for start-ups to back.
