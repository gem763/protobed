She talks about racist algorithms, people\u2019s fear of rejection \u2013 and the difficulties of dating in LA\n\nNicole Byer regularly gets asked for dating advice. \u201cNot by my friends,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause why would you ask a person who\u2019s single about dating? But strangers ask me so many questions. I\u2019m like, my podcast is literally called Why Won\u2019t You Date Me? I don\u2019t know anything about dating! If I knew, I would be dating somebody.\u201d\n\nThe podcast she is referring to is one of the world\u2019s funniest and most vulnerable; for the past two years, she has been sitting down with friends and fellow comedians to discuss her search for love, and theirs, and is soon to hit her hundredth show. As the description of the podcast has it, Byer, who is now 33, has been single for decades, despite being smart, funny and sexually voracious. Her honesty about this makes the podcast feel radical. She is open about her yearning to be loved and her frustration at how difficult it is to find the right man or woman. At a time when dating is arguably more difficult than ever, she offers candour from the trenches.\n\nThe podcast hasn\u2019t boosted her success at dating, but she doesn\u2019t find this surprising. \u201cI\u2019m not delusional,\u201d she says. \u201cI live in LA, where you have the creme de la creme of bodies to choose from. If you are a shallow person, body type is a thing. Being a black woman is a thing.\u201d In 2014, OkCupid released data showing black women were judged \u201cleast attractive\u201d by users, receiving the lowest number of matches. \u201cI understand I\u2019m not the ideal standard of beauty. I\u2019m not someone who people want to bring home to their mother. There are so many things working against me.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Byer performing in Toronto.

This sounds full of myself, but my fans really like me. They come to my meet and greets and want to connect with me, and I try to give them a little bit of myself, because I appreciate them. So any date would have to understand that the people who watch my content share my life, too. That\u2019s asking a lot.\n\n\u201cAnd if my date was a woman, she\u2019d have to understand that I have a lot of female fans and she wouldn\u2019t be able to get jealous every time a woman talked to me.\u201d\n\nThe fact that Byer has been single her whole life is baffling; she is beautiful, hilarious, warm and in every other area seems pretty close to taking over the world. She is the host of the popular and extremely silly baking show Nailed It, on Netflix, in which contestants who are not exactly capable bakers are asked to make, say, a cake in the shape of Napoleon or a phenomenally lifelike shark. Since taking her first improv class in 2008, Byer has had roles on 30 Rock and Saturday Night Live; she has written and starred in her own semi-autobiographical comedy show Loosely Exactly Nicole for MTV, and later Facebook; and, this year, her standup special was released on Netflix.\n\nOn the podcast, Byer is hilarious and boisterous. Her guests critique her dating app profiles, often expressing particular admiration for a picture that shows her climbing up a bookshelf in a catsuit. She talks about sex toys and sex acts, pornography and pole dancing \u2013 as well as her conversations with her therapist.\n\nByer discovered her gift for making people laugh as a child. \u201cMy grandmother is from Barbados so she says things Americans don\u2019t really say. If she found something funny, she\u2019d say: \u2018Oh, you tickle me,\u2019 and I liked that. So my goal was to get her to say that as much as possible.\u201d Byer has attention deficit disorder (ADD), and she says that medicating for it changed her life, allowing her to organise her thoughts and finish tasks. But her highest praise is reserved for the therapy she has undertaken over the past two years. Byer\u2019s parents died when she was young \u2013 her mother when she was 16, and her father when she was 21 \u2013 and therapy has helped her work though those unresolved traumas. \u201cThere\u2019s the saying: what doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger. No, it makes you internalise, act out and maybe harm yourself.\n\n\u201cI said to my uncle: \u2018I\u2019m on ADD medication.\u2019 He said: \u2018You don\u2019t need that.\u2019 I said: \u2018I\u2019m going to see a therapist.\u2019 He said: \u2018Why would you do that?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cIn the black community, medication and therapy is stigmatised, but I want to talk about it because my therapist has given me the tools to succeed. So why wouldn\u2019t you do [the same]?\u201d\n\nByer is also co-host of Best Friends, a podcast exploring modern female friendships, which she presents with fellow comedian Sasheer Zamata. I ask her whether there are parallels between dating and forming friendships.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Byer assesses a bake in Nailed It!, the extremely silly Netflix baking show. Photograph: Adam Rose/Netflix\n\n\u201cI think people are just as scared to make a move on a friendship as they are with a relationship. I think we are all terrified of being rejected.\u201d\n\nCould this be a reason why people won\u2019t date her? That they are simply afraid of being rejected by such an impressive, magnetic person?\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying these people maybe think I\u2019m going to reject them?\u201d she muses. \u201cHmmm. That would be an interesting flip. I do sometimes have people ask me on the apps: \u2018Is this really you? Are you really Nicole Byer?\u2019 So I\u2019d say: \u2018Why would I use Nicole Byer as a catfish?\u2019\u201d \u2013 \u2018catfishing\u2019 is where someone presents themselves as a different person online by using someone else\u2019s picture \u2013 \u201cAnd they\u2019d reply: \u2018Why wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cBut if I was going to pick a catfish,\u201d she continues, \u201cI would use a white lady\u2019s picture. That\u2019s how you would get more traction. A hot white lady.\u201d\n\nI tell Byer there is evidence to suggest that the algorithms some dating apps use further entrench social hierarchies based on factors such as race and body type. The theory goes that as black women are chosen less \u2013 arguably due to white and Eurocentric standards of beauty and femininity \u2013 they are given a lower \u201cscore\u201d for their desirability. This score in turn helps determine who they are shown, as apps want to show people others with similar scores, in the hope this will encourage matches. In effect, this keeps everyone \u201cin their place\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Byer screams. \u201cMy day is ruined. I had no idea, but it makes so much sense now that black women have such a hard time on apps. It\u2019s because the algorithm is racist!\u201d\n\nOn the podcast, her life is her material. Does she ever feel tempted to make things up or construct reality somehow \u2013 has she ever gone on a date with someone who sounded unpromising, for instance, just to have something to talk about? \u201cNo! I want to be in a relationship,\u201d she says. \u201cI will go on a date with a weirdo because maybe they could be my weirdo. And yes, they may be very fun to talk about, but I will go just in case they are perfect for me.\u201d\n\nByer remains upbeat and optimistic. \u201cI do think love is real,\u201d she says, \u201cand I do think I\u2019m going to find it.\u201d How does she stay positive? \u201cI have bad days, like everybody else, but I also have ADD, so I\u2019ll have a bad day and then something good will happen and I\u2019ll forget about the badness.\u201d", "description": "In her Why Won\u2019t You Date Me? podcast, the presenter and actor speaks with unusual candour about her search for a partner.
