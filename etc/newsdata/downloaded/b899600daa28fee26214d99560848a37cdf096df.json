Andrew has denied allegations that he had sex with her when she was 17.\n\nA special edition of Channel 4's Dispatches is set to re-examine the court papers which claim Epstein and Andrew had an orgy with Mrs Giuffre and eight other girls.\n\nHer allegations about the duke were struck from the US court record in 2015 after a judge branded them \u201cimmaterial and impertinent\u201d.\n\nThe documentary, which will air on Monday night, also looked at Mrs Giuffre's medical records from around the time she claims she was abused.\n\nIn evidence to a Florida court four years ago, Mrs Giuffre wrote: \"The third time I had sex with Andy was in an orgy on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands. I was around 18 at the time.\n\n\"Epstein, Andy, approximately eight other young girls and I had sex together.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n\"The other girls all seemed and appeared to be under the age of 18 and didn't really speak English.\n\n\"Epstein laughed about the fact they couldn't really communicate, saying that they are the 'easiest' girls to get along with.\"\n\nMedical records from New York Presbyterian Hospital show that Mrs Giuffre was admitted on July 9, 2001, after three weeks of vaginal bleeding, according to claims in the documentary.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nIn a separate court document from 2015, she wrote: \"Without going into the details of the sexual activities I was forced to endure, there were times when I was physically abused to the point that I remember fearfully thinking that I didn't know whether I was going to survive.\"\n\nThere was no suggestion she was speaking about Andrew.\n\nThe documentary claims Andrew, now 59, met Epstein at least 10 times during a 12-year friendship and had stayed with him for several days on occasions.\n\nMike Fisten, a former detective who has investigated the case, claims Epstein had 13 phone numbers for the Duke of York in an address book found at his mansion in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nAndrew said in a previous statement: \"At no stage during the limited time I spent with him did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction.\"\n\nBuckingham Palace said previously: \"Any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.\"\n\nIt added: \"It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.\"\n\nA US Federal Appeals Court has warned that allegations in court papers should not be understood as firm findings or as \"some sort of marker of reliability\" because New York law grants absolute immunity from liability for defamation.\n\nEpstein, 66, died after he was found unresponsive in his New York jail cell in August while awaiting trial on child sex trafficking charges.\n\nHis death was ruled a suicide.", "description": "A new Channel 4 documentary revisits claims that Prince Andrew joined in an orgy with Jeffrey Epstein and nine girls at the American financier's Caribbean mansion - allegations that the Duke of York has denied", "authors": ["Chris Kitching", "Image", "Getty", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article5037945.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Prince-Andrew1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
