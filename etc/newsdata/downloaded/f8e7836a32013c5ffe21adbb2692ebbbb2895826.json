This was in line with established EE policy of the government and the university.\n\n\u201cThis intention was confirmed when it was announced that Professor Rose Boswell was not an appointable candidate. Why? Because her citizenship was granted after 1994, and by implication, she did not experience generations of systematic state racism towards black and African people born in South Africa.\u201d\n\nThe group also alleged Kessi was conflicted.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the office and the research project she manages, the Decolonial Hub (entirely supported by the vice-chancellor research funds), are used in the campaign to secure her this appointment.\u201d\n\nCity Press understand that Phakeng was being dragged into the debacle because a seminar titled Citizenship and Violence: Resilient Colonialism, Xenophobia and Femicide was convened by Kessi at the beginning of this month.\n\nAn academic within BAC said posters for the seminar carried text viewed as elevating Kessi\u2019s status.\n\nWording such as \u201cacting dean of humanities presents\u201d was used instead of \u201cthe faculty of humanities presents\u201d or \u201cthe office of the dean of humanities presents\u201d, which used to be the case when such events were convened by acting deans in the past.\n\nElijah Moholola, UCT spokesperson, would not be drawn into commenting on allegations against Phakeng, only saying the \u201crecruitment processes are confidential\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe do not wish to say anything beyond the statement,\u201d Moholola said, despite being sent specific questions.\n\nKessi and Khunou declined to comment, indicating that it would be inappropriate to do so while the process was under way.\n\nBut another academic within BAC backed Kessi, arguing she was among those who spearheaded the formation of the structure.\n\n\u201cThe whole conversation about the increase of black South Africans at UCT was started by Kessi. It\u2019s so ironic and so unfair that she\u2019s been treated this way. We must have lost our humanity somewhere. If we are doing things this way, I don\u2019t want to be a South African,\u201d the academic said.\n\nIn its communiqu\u00e9, the 27% Group also said the selection committee had identified Khunou as appointable and said that UCT needed to consider employment equity legislation and targets.\n\nMoholola said in the statement that it would be inappropriate to comment in detail on any recruitment process.\n\n\u201cThe recruitment process for the position of dean of humanities is ongoing. The selection process includes an open faculty process prior to interviews, during which faculty staff are given the opportunity to meet the shortlisted candidates, after which feedback is provided to the selection committee. This could entail a public presentation to staff and students of the faculty, and/or visits to departments with the relevant faculty, and/or a meeting with the dean\u2019s advisory committee. This is followed by the final interview and recommendation.\u201d\n\nDr Nomusa Makhubu, BAC chairperson, said the structure was a collective of scholars, not a political party or closed organisation.\n\n\u201cOn principle, we respect that members may differ in opinions on a number of issues. This a healthy aspect of the collective. Difference of opinion, however, does not necessarily mean irreconcilable conflict or, as you put it, factions.\u201d\n\nThere was no BAC stance on any candidate, Makhubu said, adding that shortlisted candidates were all black.\n\nShe said it was a pity that this had become what it has.\n\n\u201cMost unsettling is that black women are being made to bear the brunt of it. It has reached the point of personal attacks, which we find disturbing. We find these allegations anti-black, Afrophobic and disappointingly vindictive. We reiterate that we unapologetically support all black scholars and will not accept the level of intimidation and divisive tactics we have witnessed during this process. As the BAC, we will continue to play our part in addressing structural racism at UCT in all its forms,\u201d she said.", "description": "University of Cape Town (UCT) vice-chancellor Professor Mamokgethi Phakeng has been dragged into a debacle over the appointment process of the dean of humanities.", "authors": ["Msindisi Fengu"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7531/53aab953b9a54ed4886b59eb3f3bf50c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
