It all started in their first fight Sept. 21 in Mexico City, which was ruled a no contest after just 15 seconds because of an accidental eye poke by Rodriguez.\n\nBut all was settled last Friday in the rematch, which turned out to be a barnburner. Rodriguez dropped Stephens with a thunderous body kick in the second round and swarmed him, but somehow Stephens was able to survive. That put \u201cEl Pantera\u201d up two rounds, but chasing the finish so hard emptied his gas tank.\n\nIn the third, Stephens landed an early takedown and controlled the round in top position. After 15 minutes, Rodriguez was awarded the decision in a \u201cFight of the Night\u201d effort, and they showed each other respect after a memorable battle.\n\nRodriguez took to Instagram to reflect on his win and show appreciation to Stephens, as he believes he\u2019s done enough to earn a title shot.\n\nI have a great team, there are plenty of words to express such gratitude, not only to my coaches but also to my friends and my family for always being with me. Despite all the bitterness that can become an experience, we always look for the positive side of things and improve as human beings. I had a pending account against a great rival, I knew it would be a hard test in my career but I feel grateful and blessed by God for the opportunity to win this victory. Focused and improving day by day, I am sure that I will reach the top in this world. I go with everything and everything but I do not go alone \u2026I HAVE A GREAT TEAM! .\n\nMy respects for this warrior who, despite all that happened before this fight at the end, showed respect and that this is only part of the \u2018business\u2019 business..I only seek to face the best of the best in the division and I hope that the @ufc after 9 fights for them, within which 8 are victories, 7 bonuses for fights and performances of the night, give me the opportunity to fight Soon for a world title.\n\nWith only one blemish on his UFC record, Rodriguez has put on a show in each of his outings. But with several featherweight contenders on the horizon, it may be difficult to call him a clear No. 1 contender. Having displayed one impressive showing after the other, he certainly has a case after Saturday night.", "description": "For as ugly as the lead-up to Yair Rodriguez vs. Jeremy Stephens 2 was, the fallout from their UFC Boston battle is looking OK.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Mike Bohn", "Nolan King", "Blue Corner", "Abbey Subhan", "The Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/yair-rodriguez-jeremy-stephens-ufc-boston-8.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
