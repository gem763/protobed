Instead of passing on the benefits of new technology, the specialist platform providers retained all the opaque fees and charges that were the hallmark of the big players.\n\n\u201cTo be fair, the platforms generally perform a good service,\u201d Ferrall says. \u201cBut they replicated the custodial infrastructure of the bank-owned wrap platforms with all their hidden costs.\u201d\n\nHe says the median cost of administration and funds management by the big players is about 1.6 per cent per annum and the specialist platform challengers have charged about 1.56 per cent.\n\nOpaque charges\n\nThe beauty of opaque fees and charges is that there can be lots of them and the consumer never really knows what they are paying. He challenges users of all platforms to ask their provider about account-keeping fees, cash fees, transactional fees, brokerage fees and fund manager fees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFerrall says the worst of all these charges is the discounted rate on deposits held with specialist platforms. He calls this a \u201ccash skim\u201d because instead of paying market deposit rates the platforms skim off 50 to 100 basis points.\n\nHe believes users of platforms are paying about $1 billion in fees that they don't need to.\n\nFerrall\u2019s product, which will be launched at the offices of Goldman Sachs in Sydney on Monday, dispenses with the costly custodial ownership approach to administering client assets in favour of the holder identification number, which is an electronic record of share ownership developed about 25 years ago by the ASX.\n\nFinClear plans to offer a managed account service using HINs to record the electronic ownership of portfolios of shares. Essentially, the HIN approach allows shares to be held in an electronic filing cabinet in the name of the investor.\n\nThe disruption here is in the replacement of the platform custodial system which puts a third party between investors and their shares.\n\nFinClear\u2019s existing operations in the wholesale execution and clearing of shares means it can offer financial advisers an integrated platform or it can allow stockbrokers to use their own infrastructure and licensing alongside FinClear's management of portfolios and implementation of trades.\n\nIf FinClear is successful, the term burning platform will have new meaning in the wrap platform space.", "description": "The days of opaque fees and charges in the wealth management platform space could be numbered if a fintech start-up is successful in disrupting a segment of financial services already experiencing intense competition.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.188%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_68%2C$y_2/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/06b6ffa6694b507dca67d4f2bfb7a5844fd6e46d", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
