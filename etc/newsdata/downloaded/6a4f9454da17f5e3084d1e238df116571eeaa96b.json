What\u2019s the next step? I think that\u2019s what we need to concede because there will be people that don\u2019t turn the guns back in. What\u2019s the next step for the federal government there?\" Scarborough asked.\n\n\"Yeah, I think just as in any law that is not followed or flagrantly abused, there have to be consequences or else there is no respect for the law,\" O'Rourke replied. \"So you know, in that case I think there would be a visit by law enforcement to recover that firearm and to make sure that it is purchased, bought back so that it cannot be potentially used against somebody else.\"\n\nO'Rourke has maintained that he believes Americans would just follow the law and hand over their AR-15s to law enforcement. He has also said he would impose fines to \"compel\" gun owners to turn them in. Democratic candidates, such as O'Rourke, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), have directly criticized South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg for not supporting mandatory gun buybacks.\n\nRecommended Different Sexes John Stossel\n\nButtigieg confronted O'Rourke during the debate, telling him, \"I don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal,\" referring to his service in the Navy.\n\n\n\n", "description": ".10/16/2019 9:28:26AM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/288/dc8f2d0f-16ef-4f9f-97be-72a3bfcdf1f9.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
