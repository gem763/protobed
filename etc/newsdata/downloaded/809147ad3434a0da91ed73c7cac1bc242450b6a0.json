A candidate needs to win either 45% of the vote or 40% with a 10 percentage point margin over the runner-up to claim outright victory. Otherwise, the top two candidates will go head-to-head in a runoff vote on Nov. 24.\n\nFernandez is heavily favored to win. A much stronger-than-expected showing over Macri in the August primaries sent shock waves through financial markets, sending the Argentine peso and equities tumbling.\n\nThe pro-market Macri won election in 2015 with a promise to revamp the country\u2019s economy. But those efforts were derailed in 2018, when crisis struck and Macri was forced to seek out a $57 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. A deep recession and soaring inflation have plagued the economy, with gross domestic product on track to have shrunk by 3.4% by the end of Macri\u2019s term and inflation set to total 240%, according to the Brookings Institution.\n\nThe peso USDARS, -0.0179% has tumbled around 37% verus the U.S. dollar in 2019 alone. Argentina\u2019s benchmark stock index SPMERVAL, +3.12% is up 13.5% in 2019 in local currency terms but remains off more than 23% from its levels ahead of the August primaries. In U.S. dollar terms, the index is off 28.4% so far this year after a 50% drop in 2018.\n\nThe MSCI EM Latin America index is up 9.2% so far in 2019. Meanwhile, the Global X MSCI Argentina ETF ARGT, +0.27% is off 4.4% so far this year.\n\nIn fact, the Latin America Index is up more than 3% in the past week, despite the looming Argentine election, protests in Bolivia, and a breakdown in talks in Ecuador that had helped to end earlier anti-austerity demonstrations, Jones noted. Also, Chile has been racked by strikes and unrest as well.\n\nThe buoyancy of the MSCI EM Latin America index is no mystery. Bolivia and Ecuador aren\u2019t included in the benchmark index, while Argentina\u2019s share is less than 2%, he noted (see chart below), while Chile\u2019s stands just a bit larger at 8%. The heavyweights are Mexico and Brazil. And Brazil has seen relatively little unrest given the scope of a pension overhaul pushed through, against the odds, by the administration of Jair Bolsonaro, Jones said.\n\nCapital Economics\n\nBrazil\u2019s benchmark Bovespa Index BVSP, +0.35% was up 2.5% this week.\n\n\u201cAs far as the outlook is concerned, we think that there could be yet more pain to come for Argentine assets following a Fern\u00e1ndez-Fern\u00e1ndez victory in the election,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it is fair to say that a lot of good news on President Bolsonaro\u2019s broader economic reform agenda in Brazil is already discounted. But even allowing for that \u2013 plus the possibility that the protests in the Andean economies continue \u2013 we think that the MSCI Latin America Index will not fare as badly as its EM Asian counterpart.\u201d\n\nThe MSCIA EM Asia Index rose 0.8% over the past week and is up 7.5% so far this year. It\u2019s more vulnerable to any escalation of the U.S.-China trade war and the further slowdown expected for China\u2019s economy in coming quarter, Jones said.\n\nMeanwhile, for Argentina, the election results might provide some relief regardless of outcome, analysts said.\n\nAt this point, \u201ca first round win would be perceived as a positive outcome by the markets in that Argentina needs to immediately implement a credible economic program, re-establish discussions with the IMF, and approach investors on re-profiling/restructuring the sovereign\u2019s debt,\u201d said Uday Patnaik, head of emerging market debt at Legal & General Investment Management, in a note this week.", "description": "Argentine assets are likely in for more pain if President Mauricio Macri is turned out of office in Sunday\u2019s election, but broader Latin American markets are...", "authors": ["William Watts", "Deputy Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU036_fernan_ZG_20191025121741.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
