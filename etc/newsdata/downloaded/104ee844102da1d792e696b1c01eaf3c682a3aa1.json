However, prime minister Boris Johnson has insisted that this right will end after Brexit.\n\nTruss insisted that a trade deal could be signed with Australia in a matter of months.\n\n\"The reason that I have chosen to make Australia one of the first countries I have visited as trade secretary is because it is an absolute priority to get on with this trade deal,\" Truss said.\n\n\"I would say months rather than years for it to be completed.\"\n\nThe Australian Trade minister said the country would look to secure greater access to the UK agriculture and services sectors as part of any deal.\n\n\"We also, as Secretary Truss rightly identified, see this as being a comprehensive and ambitious agreement,\" he said.\n\n\"We see enormous opportunities in relation to the services sector, for enhanced cooperation in the UK.\"", "description": "UK International Trade Secretary Liz Truss opens door to allowing Australians the right to live and work in the UK as part of a Brexit trade deal.", "authors": ["Adam Bienkov"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8200f42e22af6fcf259532-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
