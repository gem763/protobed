They're very cheap and they're reusable and they're much easier than trying to stretch the clingfilm. BUY NOW, \u00a32.29, Lakeland\n\nPRUE ON BAKE OFF\n\nYou\u2019re now judging your third Great British Bake-Off: do you feel like an old hand?\n\nEvery year\u2019s different but I definitely feel more relaxed now. In the first one, I think I was quite tentative, but now I know Paul much better, we get on very well and I\u2019m so fond of him. Sandi and I have also become firm friends and Noel is just lovely: he\u2019s so unpredictable and larky and quirky \u2013 it\u2019s like having a huge puppy around the place. But the first day I met Sandi, I remember feeling unnerved, thinking, \u2018My god, she\u2019s such a star and she\u2019s so clever.\u2019\n\nWould you say that you and Paul have different judging styles?\n\nYes \u2013 he\u2019s incapable of brushing over a fault. Sometimes if I feel really sorry for someone, I never lie, but I might tone it down a bit. But what\u2019s so interesting is that Paul and I always have the same opinion of the makes. We usually have a rough number out of ten in our heads and it\u2019s always the same. We\u2019ve only disagreed once the whole time I\u2019ve been on the show.\n\nWhat are your favourite dishes to judge?\n\nI think we all prefer the savoury ones because there is so much sweet. Sugar\u2019s great if you haven\u2019t had it for a while but we have it every day. So when we get savoury pie day, it\u2019s absolute heaven.\n\nPhoto credit: Channel 4 More\n\nWhat impresses you most about the Bake-off contestants?\n\nHow confident they are, not just in baking but also with the cameras on them. Very few are fazed, even on the first day. When they\u2019re asked a question, I\u2019ve never seen one say, \u201cFor god\u2019s sake, go away, I\u2019m trying to bake something.\u201d\n\nAny hints about this year\u2019s winner?\n\nMy lips are sealed! Ever since I infamously tweeted the winner from Bhutan, I\u2019m super-cautious about not giving anything away.\n\nPRUE ON THE FUTURE\n\nWhat\u2019s your next big adventure?\n\n\n\nAt the moment I\u2019m really enjoying television, but I used to hate it. Back in the 70s, I did a lot but I was always scared and I didn\u2019t like that everything was so heavily scripted. Of course, things are more free and easy now. I also loved the buzz of running my own catering company. I think it\u2019s why I\u2019ve enjoyed launching my own range of specs so much. I like the challenge of sorting out budgets and production and, of course, it\u2019s lovely to have 72 pairs of glasses to choose from!
