This device is said to be part of the Surface Pro line, and while it may not have the same top-end performance as its x86-based siblings, the use of an ARM CPU (probably a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx chip) could offer significantly better battery life.\n\nFinally, while Blass didn\u2019t have any pictures to show, he claims Microsoft is also planning on announcing some sort of \u201cdual-screen Surface,\u201d which for anyone who remembers the cancelled Microsoft Courier project, is something a lot of folks have been waiting to see for almost a decade.\n\nIf these leaks are accurate, the upcoming event could be one of Microsoft\u2019s biggest product launches in recent history. Thankfully, we\u2019ll be on the ground tomorrow for the show, so check back for more updates and info soon.", "description": "While Microsoft is expected to show off a bunch of new devices at an event tomorrow in New York City, like a lot of other launches this spring, recent leaks may have just given us a ton of insight into what might actually get announced....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones", "Alex Cranz"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/bsc337nnzj0il71c81qy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
