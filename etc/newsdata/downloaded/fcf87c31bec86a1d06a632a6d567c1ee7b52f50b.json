Jamie Oliver was branded a 'filthy pervert' by This Morning presenter Phillip Schofield after he suggested putting salad in a Cornish Pasty\n\nHe shouted: 'Salad in a pasty!? You filthy pervert!,' prompting laughter from the production crew.\n\nThe exchange had started with Jamie explaining how to cook the meat-free pasty.\n\nHe said: 'A lot of people that are trying to cut meat out, or go a little bit lighter, think that they can't have these delicious things.\n\n'So flaky, classic pastry, half fat to flour, and then I've got the classic potatoes, onions mushrooms, in here, with lots of black pepper, there's a little process that I've got.'\n\nBad idea: When Jamie suggested 'opening up a little pocket' in the pasty to 'shove' some salad in, Schofield, 57, reacted with horror\n\nInteresting choice: Phillip shouted: Salad in a pasty!?

I was very na\u00efve.\n\n'I was good at running one restaurant. I opened lots of big restaurants and people like small restaurants and we sort of had these big cathedrals we couldn't fill.'\n\nHelpful: The chef appeared on the popular morning show on ITV on Thursday to show viewers how to replace meat in classic dishes\n\nNot well received: Schofield's reaction prompted laughter from members of the programme's production crew\n\nHe added: 'The staff got paid up to the date and I made sure of that.
