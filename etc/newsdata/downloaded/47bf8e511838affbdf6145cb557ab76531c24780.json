This is expected to take place around 10:15 a.m. ET.\n\nHis remarks come amid an ongoing U.S.-China trade deadlock, and as tensions mount between the U.S. and Iran, most recently after U.S. officials blamed Tehran for attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities. Meanwhile, millions of activists have marched worldwide in recent days to demand governments activate to combat climate change.\n\nOn the U.S.-China trade front, circumstances improved ahead of Trump\u2019s public remarks. The Chinese government granted new wavers to some state and private companies to purchase soybeans exempt from retaliatory tariffs, according to a Bloomberg report Tuesday morning, citing unnamed people familiar with the situation. Chinese commitments for more U.S. agricultural purchases have been a key sticking point in the path to a trade deal between the two nations.\n\nEU rulings\n\nShares of big tech companies were bid higher Tuesday after court rulings favoring Alphabet\u2019s Google (GOOGL, GOOG) and Starbucks (SBUX) were interpreted constructively for other firms in similar legal positions.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s Google will not have to extend so-called \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d rules outside of EU member states, based on a decision by the top court in the EU.\n\nThe right to be forgotten rule was created in Europe in 2014 and requires that Google remove search engine links to sensitive information upon users\u2019 requests. A French privacy regulator had fined Google in 2016 for failing to de-reference these sensitive links outside of the European bloc as well.\n\nBut based on the new ruling, only EU member states will be subject to the 2014 right to be forgotten rule. The ruling also included a requirement, however, that Google implement safeguards to discourage users from leaving the EU in order to find the information.\n\nTraders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 18, 2019.

This would have required that the coffee giant pay 30 million euros in unpaid taxes. The European Court of Justice \u2013 the EU\u2019s highest court \u2013 can still appeal the Tuesday decision, however.\n\nFiat Chrysler, on the other hand, lost its fight against a demand to pay a similar amount in back taxes to the government of Luxembourg. In its ruling Tuesday, the EU General Court upheld a EU Commission decision that Fiat had benefitted from selective tax arrangements in the country.\n\nThese differing court decisions are likely to be closely watched by Apple. The tech giant remains caught in the crosshairs of a similar EU tax crackdown and had been ordered in 2016 to pay 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland.\n\nPound jumps amid hopes of averting no-deal Brexit\n\nElsewhere, the 11 judges of UK\u2019s top court unanimously decided Tuesday that Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s controversial move to suspend Parliament earlier this month was unlawful.\n\nThe ruling called on lawmakers to immediately return to Parliament, laying the groundwork for a challenge to Johnson\u2019s EU exit strategy.\n\nWhile Johnson has said he would try to renegotiate former Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, he planned to leave the EU by the Oct. 31 deadline whether or not negotiations were successful.", "description": "U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open Tuesday as investors digested more upbeat news on global trade prospects.", "authors": ["Emily Mccormick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0Zi2.kbLOz6rLmorCTj16A--~B/aD00MDc3O3c9NjExNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/6ed2fcd0-dec7-11e9-b764-98d6d8349187", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
