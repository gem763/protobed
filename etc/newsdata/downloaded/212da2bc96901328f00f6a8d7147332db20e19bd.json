However, California Governor Gavin Newsom denied the parole board\u2019s request in June. That decision was brought to an appeals court Friday, with two of the three appellate judges upholding the governor\u2019s denial.\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\n\u201cThe Governor\u2019s determination that Van Houten has not taken full responsibility for her role in the crimes, and continues to pose a risk to the public, is supported by some evidence in the record,\u201d the court ruled, the Mercury News reports.\n\nHowever, the lone dissenting appellate judge noted that \u201cthere is not a modicum of evidence\u201d to show that Van Houten is still a danger.\n\nInitially sentenced to death for her role in the Manson family murders, Van Houten was given life in prison after California abolished the death penalty. Van Houten \u2013 who admitted that she and fellow Manson family member Patricia Krenwinkel held a pillowcase over Rosemary LaBianca\u2019s head, gagged her with a lamp cord, and stabbed her between 14 and 16 times; she did not take part in the murders at Sharon Tate\u2019s home \u2013 has had her parole recommendation overturned three times, twice by former California governor Jerry Brown and now once by Newsom.\n\n\u201cMs. Van Houten and the Manson family committed some of the most notorious and brutal killings in California history,\u201d Newsom previously said in a statement. \u201cWhen considered as a whole, I find the evidence shows that she currently poses an unreasonable danger to society if released from prison at this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI expected her to go home within a week or two, I really did. And that\u2019s not happening,\u201d Van Houten\u2019s lawyer Rich Pfieffer said after Friday\u2019s ruling. \u201cTwo things you can bank on: She\u2019s gonna get out, and I\u2019m not giving up until she does.\u201d", "description": "The Governor\u2019s determination that Van Houten has not taken full responsibility for her role in the crimes, and continues to pose a risk to the public, is supported by some evidence in the record\"", "authors": ["Daniel Kreps"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QjN.Yl7VdAMQ_KnWzVOuIQ--~B/aD0yMjI1O3c9MzE5OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/rollingstone.com/3a5fe1e78968a19c1e51d3dc7d2b82af", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
