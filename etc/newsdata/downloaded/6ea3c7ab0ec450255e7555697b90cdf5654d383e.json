Moreover, many students are eligible for loan forgiveness, which is often available after 20 or 25 years of repayments, but sometimes as soon as 10 years of repayments under Public Service Loan Forgiveness.\n\nOf course, the reality for some students is that federal loans are not enough to finance their entire education, and they may need to turn to private loans as a result.\n\nSo how do all of these options for financing one\u2019s college expenses stack up?\n\nTo examine this question, I recently ran some simulations comparing a hypothetical English major and aerospace engineer financing their education using Direct federal loans, a typical private loan and an ISA according to the terms outlined in the ISA offered by the Purdue Research Foundation.\n\nUnder the Purdue agreement, a senior at Purdue graduating in December of 2019 wanting to receive $1,000 in financing would need to pay 0.45% of their income for 116 months if they are an English major, or 0.27% of their income for 92 months if they are an aerospace engineer.\n\nThe results suggested that, in most cases, Direct federal loans were a better option for students than an ISA. Interestingly, this was true for the English major at all levels of future income, but the aerospace engineer actually did come out ahead with an ISA if they earned substantially below average for someone of their major ($30,000 to $50,000 compared to an average of $62,000, according to Purdue Research Foundation's comparison tool).\n\nThe reason? Direct federal loans actually provide superior downside protection to the terms in the ISA agreement, while also providing better upside in the event that a graduate earned close to an average level of income or higher.\n\nThe results were less straightforward when comparing ISAs to private loans. In this case, the decision may come down to how risk-averse a student is and how concerned they are about earning less than expected upon graduation, as ISAs do provide superior downside protection to students, albeit with less upside in the event that students earn near an average income or higher upon graduation. This outcome was due to private loans not providing any type of income-driven relief for lower-earning borrowers, but still being less expensive overall if students do not face difficulty making their payments.\n\nThe best scenarios for using ISAs may be cases where students can engage in significant adverse selection\u2014meaning they possess private information about themselves that is unknowable to a third party in an ISA.\n\nFor instance, a student in a higher earning major who expects to pursue a lower earning career could come out ahead with an ISA compared to Direct federal loans by receiving financing at a more attractive rate than their expected future income would warrant. Additionally, students who desire to be a stay-at-home parent or otherwise anticipate taking significant time out of the workforce after graduation could come out ahead with an ISA, as, interestingly, the Purdue agreement only \u201cpauses\u201d an individual\u2019s repayment obligations for a maximum period of 60 months out of the workforce.\n\nFinally, the way \u201cearned income\u201d is defined in ISAs may provide opportunities for students to selectively opt into such agreements. For instance, those with a business that generates Schedule E income could come out ahead, as the Purdue ISA appears to define income solely as W-2 and Schedule C income. Additionally, because 401(k) contributions do not count toward W-2 income, ISAs may be relatively more attractive to those who can aggressively fund 401(k)s, perhaps due to having a second earner in one\u2019s household (spousal income is not counted towards one\u2019s income under Purdue\u2019s terms).\n\nRead the latest Investing in Funds & ETFs.", "description": "Income-driven mechanisms of ISAs are already built into many federal student loans, says WSJ Wealth Management Expert Derek Tharp.", "authors": ["Derek Tharp"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-EL446_isa_P_20190709095214.jpg"}
