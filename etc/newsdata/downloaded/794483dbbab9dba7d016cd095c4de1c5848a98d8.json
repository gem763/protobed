A disembodied voice. A coded threat.\n\nWilliam Taylor, a career diplomat, went behind closed doors in the basement of the Capitol on Tuesday and told a tale that added up to the ultimate oxymoron \u2014 a 10-hour bureaucratic thriller.\n\nHis plot devices were not cloak and dagger, but memos, text messages \u2014 and detailed notes.\n\nHis testimony was laden with precision \u2014 names, dates, places, policy statements and diplomatic nuance, not typically the stuff of intrigue. But from the moment Taylor revealed that his wife and his mentor had given him conflicting advice on whether he should even get involved, the drama began to unfold.\n\nTheir counsel split like this: Wife: no way. Mentor: do it.\n\nThe mentor won out \u2014 or the story would have ended there.\n\nInstead, on June 17, Taylor, a West Point graduate, Vietnam veteran and tenured foreign service officer, arrived in Ukraine\u2019s capital of Kyiv as the chief of mission. He had been recalled to service after the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine had been forced out. That alone offered foreshadowing of troubles to come.\n\nSee: U.S. diplomat directly links Ukraine aid to investigations into Bidens, Democrats\n\nAnd, soon enough, Taylor said in his written opening statement, he discovered \u201ca weird combination of encouraging, confusing and ultimately alarming circumstances.\u201d\n\nThe story Taylor related from there amounted to a detailed, almost prosecutorial, rejoinder to White House efforts to frame President Donald Trump\u2019s actions in Ukraine as perfectly normal and unworthy of an impeachment investigation. With each documented conversation, he made it harder for the president to press his argument that there was no quid pro quo in which he held up military aid to advance his political interests.\n\nOver three months, Taylor told legislators, he fought his way through a maze of diplomatic channels and rival back channels as he tried to unravel the story behind the mysterious holdup of $400 million in U.S. military aid that Ukraine desperately needed in order to defend itself against the Russians.\n\nFirst came mixed signals about whether Trump would follow through on his promise to invite Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to meet with him in the Oval Office.\n\nGordon Sondland, a Trump ally and U.S. ambassador to the European Union, \u2014 of which Ukraine is not a member \u2014 \u2018wanted to make sure no one was transcribing or monitoring\u2019 a June 28 call that the diplomats made to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Taylor\u2019s prepared testimony\n\nTaylor was told by other U.S. diplomats that Trump needed \u201cto hear from\u201d Zelensky before the meeting would be scheduled. And that Zelensky needed to make clear he was not standing in the way of \u201cinvestigations.\u201d\n\nNext, Taylor wrote, there was \u201csomething odd\u201d: Gordon Sondland, a Trump ally and U.S. ambassador to the European Union, \u201cwanted to make sure no one was transcribing or monitoring\u201d a June 28 call that the diplomats made to Zelensky.\n\nSoon enough, Taylor was detecting that Zelensky\u2019s hopes of snagging the coveted Oval Office meeting were contingent on the Ukrainian leader agreeing to investigate Democrats in the 2016 election and to look into a Ukrainian company linked to the family of Trump political foe Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cIt was clear that this condition was driven by the irregular policy channel I had come to understand was guided by Mr. Giuliani,\u201d Taylor said, referring to Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and Trump lawyer who was involving himself in Ukrainian affairs.\n\nThe dueling channels of communication were highly unusual.\n\nThen things got more strange.\n\nToward the end of a routine July 18 video conference with National Security Council officials in Washington, \u201ca voice on the call\u201d from an unknown person who was off-screen announced that the Office of Management and Budget would not approve any more U.S. security aid to Ukraine \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI and others sat in astonishment,\u201d Taylor recounted.\n\nAssociated Press Ambassador William Taylor is escorted by U.S. Capitol Police as he arrives Tuesday to testify before House committees.\n\nFrom there, Taylor made his way through a confusing web of conversations, text messages, cables and other contacts trying to figure out why this was happening.\n\nHis diplomatic parrying was punctuated by a detour to the front lines of the Russia-Ukraine fighting in northern Donbas, where Taylor witnessed firsthand \u201cthe armed and hostile Russia-led forces on the other side of the damaged bridge across the line of contact.\u201d\n\nThat frozen military aid was no mere abstraction.\n\n\u201cMore Ukrainians would undoubtedly die without the U.S. assistance,\u201d Taylor wrote.\n\nThe diplomat was so troubled that he requested a private meeting with John Bolton when the national security adviser visited Kyiv in late August.\n\nBolton\u2019s counsel to Taylor: Send a \u201cfirst-person cable\u201d to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo laying out his concerns. Taylor took the advice and sent a secret cable describing the \u201cfolly\u201d of withholding assistance.\n\nHe got no specific response.\n\nTime was running out: If the assistance wasn\u2019t delivered by Sept. 30, the end of the government\u2019s fiscal year, it would vanish.\n\nHe still couldn\u2019t explain to the Ukrainians why they weren\u2019t getting their aid.\n\nAnd time was running out: If the assistance wasn\u2019t delivered by Sept. 30, the end of the government\u2019s fiscal year, it would vanish.\n\nIn early September, the puzzle pieces began to fit together.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the Oval Office meeting that was contingent on Zelensky investigating Democrats, Taylor learned; it was the military aid, too.\n\nTaylor said Sondland told him that if Zelensky didn\u2019t publicly announce the investigations, there would a \u201cstalemate.\u201d\n\nHe took \u201cstalemate\u201d to be code for holding up the assistance.\n\nSee: U.S. envoy Taylor reportedly says he was told Trump wanted Ukraine aid to be contingent on Biden probe\n\nTaylor\u2019s text messages take the story forward:\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d he wrote to Sondland.\n\nSondland waited five hours to respond with a clinical denial of any such contingency: \u201cThe President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.\u201d He reportedly talked to Trump before he sent the response.\n\nThe explanation didn\u2019t satisfy Taylor.\n\nBut, at last, on Sept. 11, Taylor got word that the hold on releasing the money had been lifted and the security assistance would be provided.\n\nTaylor summed up his tale as \u201ca rancorous story about whistleblowers, Mr. Giuliani, side channels, quid pro quos, corruption, and interference in elections.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the Oval Office meeting that was contingent on Zelensky investigating Democrats, Taylor learned; it was the military aid, too.\n\nDemocrats found it riveting, with Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois describing Taylor as \u201clike a witness out of central casting.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, though, dismissed it as part of a \u201ccoordinated smear campaign from far-left lawmakers and radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the Constitution.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Taylor, who\u2019d reportedly appeared Tuesday in response to a subpoena after a State Department bid to block his testimony before lawmakers, said he wished he could have told a different story altogether \u2014 a \u201cpositive, bipartisan one\u201d about a \u201cyoung nation, struggling to break free of its past.\u201d\n\nRead on: Trump compares impeachment inquiry to lynching, drawing condemnation", "description": "It took Taylor \u2014 who complied with a subpoena to appear, after the State Department reportedly tried to block his testimony \u2014 a full hour to read his opening...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT816_taylor_ZG_20191022204952.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
