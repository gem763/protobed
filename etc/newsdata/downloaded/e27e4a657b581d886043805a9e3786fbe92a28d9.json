Commissioners\u2019 hearings reviewed", "language": "en", "text": "It's the theatrical run everyone had been waiting for. Well, everyone in the Brussels bubble. Maybe.\n\nOver the past couple of weeks, aspiring European commissioners have been putting on a series of one-woman and one-man shows at the European Parliament. Their aim: to convince MEPs that they deserve a five-year run on the Brussels stage.\n\nSo who won over the audience and the critics in their confirmation hearings? Who was more \u201cmeh\u201d than megastar? And who had the punters reaching for the rotten fruit?\n\nPOLITICO watched every performance (so normal people didn't have to) and the reviews are in.\n\nTop performers\n\nFrans Timmermans (Executive Vice President for the European Green Deal, Netherlands)\n\nHigh point: Timmermans\u2019 rendition of a snippet of poetry from Edwin James Milliken to liken the Earth\u2019s climate trajectory to that of a man who falls asleep while driving a train \u2014 a rather dramatic end to the hearing. \u201cFor the pace is hot, and the points are near, and sleep hath deadened the driver\u2019s ear; and signals flash through the night in vain. Death is in charge of the clattering train!\u201d\n\nLow point: The largely polished Timmermans flubbed in a couple policy areas that did not go unnoticed by MEPs \u2014 he erroneously suggested the EU\u2019s Emissions Trading System did not cover aviation and was accused of dodging questions on agriculture.\n\nKey quote: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely clear there\u2019s no future in coal.\u201d\n\nVerdict: Akin to a well-produced documentary. Timmermans charmed MEPs with his linguistic skills, made some firm policy pledges and kept the drama to a minimum.\n\nRating (out of 5): \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 1/2\n\nDidier Reynders (Justice, Belgium)\n\nHigh point: Reynders championed the rule of law and consumers. He pleased many MEPs by pledging to push hard for an answer from the Council on a controversial proposal that would allow groups of consumers to sue companies and seek compensation.\n\nLow point: MEPs tried to push Reynders on domestic allegations of corruption but he stuck to his lawyer-approved boilerplate answer and denied all allegations. \u201cThis person publicly stated he wanted to stop me from becoming European commissioner,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn't wish on anybody what my family, my spouse, those close to me had to experience.\u201d\n\nKey quote: \u201cWe need to ask more and more information on the algorithms\u201d \u2014 promising to open the black box of artificial intelligence.\n\nPlot twist: The lights went out in the middle of the hearing, forcing everyone to move two floors up. The ushers got a huge round of applause for preparing a new room within 20 minutes.\n\nVerdict: Solid all-round performance. Didn\u2019t get into trouble, dodged domestic allegations successfully and smoothly handled questions ranging from consumer rights to rule of law, and from data protection to AI.\n\nRating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 1/2\n\nStella Kyriakides (Health, Cyprus)\n\nHigh point: A breast cancer survivor and former president of a breast cancer patients group, Kyriakides got into the weeds on cancer prevention methods as she called for \u201call hands on deck\u201d to beat the disease.\n\nLow point: \u201cI\u2019m trying to understand why I haven\u2019t been convincing on pesticides,\u201d Kyriakides said after fielding five questions on the topic.\n\nKey quote: \u201cIn no way do I underestimate the effect that pesticides have on health, and it would be unheard of to be health commissioner and not to take this on.\u201d\n\nVerdict: Though MEPs were, indeed, unconvinced by what she said on pesticides, they soaked up Kyriakides\u2019 expertise on health \u2014 especially given that her hearing was immediately after Polish nominee Janusz Wojciechowski\u2019s first, bumbling performance.\n\nRating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\nPhil Hogan (Trade, Ireland)\n\nHigh point: Hogan won spontaneous applause from across the political spectrum after a hearing in which he ticked all the boxes: He knew the MEPs and the subjects that mattered to them. He had the talking points to address each major political group\u2019s priorities.\n\nLow point: He kept getting his future boss\u2019s name wrong: He talked about a certain \"Mrs. van der Leyen.\" He also ducked questions on how he planned to enforce environmental and labor rights chapters in trade agreements.\n\nKey quote: \u201cEurope has to stand up for itself.\u201d\n\nVerdict: Hogan was well-prepared. It was clear that he was not on the parliamentarians\u2019 hit list.\n\nRating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\nHelena Dalli (Equality, Malta)\n\nHigh point: Dalli quickly shot down an MEP from the far-right ID group, who suggested that allowing people to \u201cchoose\u201d their gender would allow people to \u201ccheat\u201d sporting rules. \u201cGender reassignment is certainly not a walk in the park,\u201d Dalli said to applause.\n\nLow point: Dalli didn\u2019t reply directly to a question about whether she was satisfied with the public inquiry set up last month by the Maltese government to look into the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.\n\nKey quote: \u201cThe 21st century must be the century of women being equal.\u201d\n\nVerdict: Dalli\u2019s strong and personal testimony impressed MEPs and within hours it was clear she had the necessary majority to be confirmed.\n\nRating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\nVirginijus Sinkevi\u010dius (Environment & Oceans, Lithuania)\n\nHigh point: \u201cFor us 2050 is not just a target on a piece of paper, we have to live it,\u201d the 28-year-old nominee said of the lofty goal of reaching climate neutrality by mid-century.\n\nLow point: May regret overpromising. He pledged a non-toxic environment strategy that \u201cneeds to go beyond\u201d what the outgoing Commission proposed and an update of air pollution standards in line with World Health Organization recommendations. Those would need the approval of the entire College of Commissioners \u2014 no easy task for a newbie.\n\nKey quote: \u201cThis mandate will be the greenest that Europe has ever seen.\u201d\n\nVerdict: Smooth sailing. Sinkevi\u010dius was well prepared, often citing facts and figures, and his bold ambitions impressed MEPs. Within hours they gave him the green light.\n\nRating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\nElisa Ferreira (Cohesion & Reforms, Portugal)\n\nHigh point: Ferreira decided to address concerns about potential conflicts of interest head-on. She said she\u2019d abstain from EU funding decisions which could directly or indirectly impact the personal interests of her husband, who works for a regional development body.\n\nLow point: Couldn\u2019t give a clear answer on where the money will come from for a Just Transition Fund, meant to ease the move to green energy for countries heavily dependent on fossil fuels.\n\nKey quote: \"You will be hearing from us soon, with a Commission proposal in the first 100 days\" on that transition fund.\n\nVerdict: Ferreira\u2019s hearing ended with a long round of applause from MEPs from across the political spectrum, showing she enjoys broad support. She may not have had all the answers but they liked her nonetheless.\n\nRating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\nMaro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d (Vice President for Interinstitutional relations & Foresight, Slovakia)\n\nHigh point: \u201cAs an expert on foresight, you already know what I\u2019m going to say \u2026 What will I have for dinner?\u201d asked Green MEP Nico Semsrott, a satirist by profession. \u201cIt\u2019s true, some of my colleagues have been asking me if I can tell them what will be the next Lotto numbers,\u201d \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d quipped back.\n\nLow point: \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d struggled to defend his boss Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s plan for a \u201cone in, one out\u201d policy to limit the volume of EU legislation \u2014 something MEPs said could reduce consumer and environmental protections. \u201cThe European Union isn\u2019t a nightclub,\u201d German MEP Tiemo W\u00f6lken said.\n\nKey quote: \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d pledged a \u201cspecial partnership\u201d with the European Parliament that includes \u201ca new right of initiative, which I know is very important for you.\u201d\n\nVerdict: A smooth opening act in which \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d made sure to hit the right notes to fuel Parliament\u2019s ambitions.\n\nRating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\nPaolo Gentiloni (Economy, Italy)\n\nHigh point: \u201cI shall defend to the hilt the cause of Europe,\u201d the former Italian prime minister said in closing remarks that put an exclamation point on his overall approach: show gravitas and present himself as someone able to put aside nationality.\n\nLow point: Asked about his assets \u2014 property including four apartments plus \u20ac620,000 of securities \u2014 Gentiloni turned slightly defensive, perhaps not in tone but in words. \u201cI wasn\u2019t rich by any means,\u201d he said and offered a joke that didn\u2019t quite land about how Italian media had inflated his holdings into \u201cthe portfolio of a millionaire.\u201d But he said he\u2019d sold off his stocks, which had included more than \u20ac100,000 in Amazon shares.\n\nKey quote: \u201cI want to be very clear on this, crystal clear, if possible. I\u2019m not and I will not be the representative of a single government in the Commission.\"\n\nVerdict: Put the issue of national loyalties to bed from the start, with a mix of high rhetoric about European ideals and some skillful bureaucratic misdirection. Also showed a deft hand in signaling to both sides of Europe\u2019s north-south divide, calling for a shared unemployment program while pledging no \u201cpermanent transfer from country to country\u201d of funds.\n\nRating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\nNicolas Schmit (Jobs, Luxembourg)\n\nHigh point: Schmit assured Nordic MEPs that a minimum wage framework he plans to put forward \u201crapidly\u201d won\u2019t undermine their collective bargaining systems.\n\nLow point: British MEP Matthew Patten accused Schmit of failing to address discrimination in the labor market. The bloc\u2019s motto may as well be, \u201cunited in diversity, as long as you\u2019re white,\u201d Patten said.\n\nKey quote: \u201cNo country should be allowed to use social dumping for its own workers. That flies in the face of the European spirit.\u201d\n\nVerdict: For Schmit, a longtime employment minister turned MEP in Parliament\u2019s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, this was an easy home game.\n\nRating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\nJutta Urpilainen (International Partnerships, Finland)\n\nHigh point: \u201cEradication of poverty is at the center of our work,\" Urpilainen told legislators. That likely came as a relief to many development advocates, who fear development funding will be hijacked for other policy priorities, such as migration.\n\nLow point: There wasn\u2019t really one in what was a low-key hearing.\n\nKey quote: \u201cI see that we need to invest more in Africa, and we need to have [the] private sector to be part of that approach.\u201d\n\nVerdict: The former Finnish finance minister flew through her friendly hearing, finishing half an hour ahead of time.\n\nRating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\nMargaritis Schinas (Vice President for Protecting our European Way of Life, Greece)\n\nHigh point: Schinas deftly deflected concerns about his job title. After three hours of questions, it was even a subject for humor. Juan Fernando L\u00f3pez Aguilar, who co-chaired the hearing, joked that \u201cworking this late is definitely not in line with the European way of life.\u201d\n\nLow point: For those who tuned in for answers on the EU\u2019s plans to fight disinformation and digital threats, Schinas\u2019 hearing was a disappointment \u2014 with no mention of fighting hybrid threats, cybercrime or other security threats.\n\nKey quote: \u201cThe job I am entrusted to do is one that has never existed before. It is a new job,\u201d Schinas said. \u201cAlthough the job is new, the problems are old, and they are deeply rooted.\u201d\n\nVerdict: Smooth operation. All the communication skills of the Commission\u2019s former chief spokesman were deployed to defuse arguments over his job title and win confirmation.\n\nRating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\nMiddle of the road\n\nJohannes Hahn (Budget & Administration, Austria)\n\nHigh point: Auditioning for his third term as a commissioner, Hahn made the most of his strong relationships with MEPs, noting many in the room already have his mobile number.\n\nLow point: He struggled to answer the question of how the new Commission will finance its ambitious policy pledges, in particular on climate.\n\nKey quote: \"It would be not serious if I give you a promise about a certain percentage,\" Hahn told MEPs when discussing the size of the future EU budget. Not a great soundbite but smart \u2014 as that figure will be the subject of bitter debate among member countries.\n\nVerdict: MEPs were not always convinced by Hahn\u2019s replies, but were nonetheless impressed by his years of experience, directness and knowledge of topic area.\n\nRating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 1/2\n\nJosep Borrell (EU high representative for foreign affairs, Spain)\n\nHigh point: (For Borrell, anyway. Not for Parliament as a watchdog.) Getting a round of applause for stopping to drink some coffee before giving his closing statement.\n\nLow point: Coming under repeated questioning over his financial affairs, including a fine for insider trading. Borrell repeatedly insisted he had not deliberately done anything wrong and suggested the timing of the controversial share sale was an unfortunate accident.\n\nKey quote: \"I believe that borders are the scars that history left engraved on the skin of the earth, has etched with blood and fire, and that the progress of humanity consists in overcoming borders.\u201d\n\nVerdict: As a former president of the Parliament, Borrell was always unlikely to face a rough ride. Assured but not dazzling display.\n\nRating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\nMargrethe Vestager (Executive Vice President for Europe fit for the digital age, Denmark)\n\nHigh point: When told by Brexit Party MEP John Tennant that he was looking forward to Britain\u2019s departure from the EU so the country could gain greater sovereignty (particularly over its tax dealings) but that she should \u201ccarry on,\u201d Vestager quipped: \u201cI don't share your views, but I appreciate your good wishes.\u201d\n\nLow point: Vestager did not provide convincing replies to MEPs asking about how she would manage her two hats, as executive vice president for digital affairs and also competition chief. There are worries she can\u2019t be Europe industry's coach and referee at the same time. She kept repeating that \u201cthe independence in law enforcement is non-negotiable,\u201d but conceded the issue would require \u201csome care.\u201d\n\nKey quote: \u201cI will do my best in the second season.\u201d (In a reference to the hit Danish political TV drama \u201cBorgen,\u201d which she reportedly inspired.)\n\nVerdict: Good but not wow. Vestager is barely changing portfolio and she already had first-hand experience of what confirmation hearings are all about. Not a standout performance from the nominee \u2014 or her remarkably tame audience.\n\nRating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\nV\u011bra Jourov\u00e1 (Vice President for Values and Transparency, Czech Republic)\n\nHigh point: Striking a balance between the work of the current Commission on rule of law and making clear she'd do things her own way. Managed to pay respect to current rule-of-law supremo while also making clear she wouldn't just be Timmermans II.\n\nLow point: Jourov\u00e1 struggled with questions about threats to journalists coming from their own national governments inside the EU, admitting that there's not much the Commission can do to help: \u201cThis is a very difficult question, and I will not pretend that the European Union is equipped with strong legislative or executive power in these cases.\u201d\n\nKey quote: Pledging to make tech platforms more accountable for the content they carry. \u201cThe e-commerce directive is still a very strong legislation, which says that platforms are not responsible for the content \u2026 And we will have to look at this to see if we need a stronger push to increase the responsibility,\u201d she said. \u201cI am convinced that we need such a push.\u201d\n\nVerdict: The veteran commissioner\u2019s performance, in which she also struggled to keep to time, did not wow those expecting more innovative and substantive ideas on improving transparency, protecting European democracy and enforcing the rule of law.\n\nRating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\nValdis Dombrovskis (Executive Vice President for an Economy that Works for People, Latvia)\n\nHigh point: Dombrovskis delivered a clear pledge to introduce legislation for the virtual currency backed by Facebook \u2014 calling out Libra by name, with no hedging about commissioning studies, convening expert panels or plotting roadmaps.\n\nLow point: Right-wing Slovak MEP Miroslav Rada\u010dovsk\u00fd devoted part of his question time to name-checking a businessman from his hometown and voicing hope that more people from eastern Slovakia would make it to the Parliament.\n\nKey quote: \u201cWe\u2019ll need to regulate Libra to supervise it on EU level both from the point of financial stability and the protection of investors.\u201d\n\nVerdict: The candidate was focused, crisp, detailed \u2014 and successful in his mission of displaying a steady grip on his familiar subjects of finance and economics. But his nearly three hours of reciting directives and action plans lacked something: any sense of drama or other entertainment value, at least beyond eastern Slovakia.\n\nRating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\nMariya Gabriel (Innovation and Youth, Bulgaria)\n\nHigh point: Her smooth, uncontroversial confirmation.\n\nLow point: Dodging a question on how to ensure research investments go to green tech. And the hugs and kisses with MEPs after the hearing, which suggested Parliament had hardly acted as much of a watchdog.\n\nKey quote: \u201cI\u2019m clearly on the side of the European Parliament \u2026 I support increasing the budget for Horizon Europe [research funding]. it\u2019s not an item of spending but investment.\u201d\n\nVerdict: Political equivalent of a three-star romcom. Love was definitely in the air as Gabriel, a former MEP, returned to the European Parliament.\n\nRating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\nJanez Lenar\u010di\u010d (Crisis management, Slovenia)\n\nHigh point: Lenar\u010di\u010d claimed to have the answer to the famous question attributed to Henry Kissinger: \u201cWho do I call if I want to speak to Europe?\u201d To applause and laughter at the end of his hearing, he held up a piece of paper with the number of the EU\u2019s emergency response center.\n\nLow point: Didn\u2019t really face one in a low-key hearing. Lowest point for observers was when one MEP delved deep into the EU jargon bag and came out with the \u201cexternal action cluster.\u201d\n\nKey quote: \u201cIt is a noble mission, it is a way to show the best face of Europe around the world,\u201d Lenar\u010di\u010d said of his new post. \u201cSolidarity is something that people don\u2019t think about until the moment they need it. And then they remember it. Forever.\u201d\n\nVerdict: Solid, unspectacular performance by a career diplomat who\u2019d clearly done his homework. Hardly the toughest of grillings \u2014 it\u2019s hard to be against humanitarian aid.\n\nRating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\nYlva Johansson (Home Affairs, Sweden)\n\nHigh point: No standout moment but the former minister was able to reassure some who feared she was too leftwing.\n\nLow point: Her reluctance to share details on how she wants to reform EU asylum policy. That earned her the nickname of the \u201ccomeback commissioner\u201d from Portuguese MEP Paulo Rangel, as she kept promising to come back with answers later. Her vagueness meant she was required to answer additional written questions.\n\nKey quote: \u201cI have been tackling and cracking tough nuts before in my political career.\u201d\n\nVerdict: Perhaps it\u2019s understandable that she didn\u2019t want to share details on her ideas for reforming EU asylum policy, given the sensitivity of the subject. But this leaves an open question: Does she actually have a plan?\n\nRating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\nStrugglers\n\nKadri Simson (Energy, Estonia)\n\nHigh point: A tweet by Estonian Prime Minister J\u00fcri Ratas during her hearing, saying her home country is now on board with an EU-wide climate neutrality goal of 2050. That helped burnish Simson\u2019s climate credentials, which were under fire from Green MEPs attacking Estonia\u2019s reliance on shale oil.\n\nLow point: Simson\u2019s nervousness and hesitation made her unable to give MEPs clear answers on a number of questions.\n\nKey quote: \u201cI can closely cooperate with member states, and motivate them to raise their targets.\u201d\n\nVerdict: Underwhelming. For environmental NGOs, Simson\u2019s performance was \u201calarmingly weak.\u201d She made it through confirmation but will still need to prove she\u2019s up to the job.\n\nRating: \u2b50\u2b50 1/2\n\nDubravka \u0160uica (Vice president for democracy and demography, Croatia)\n\nHigh point: She showed she knew her audience by wishing French MEP Pascal Durand a happy birthday after he asked her a question. That prompted a smattering of applause.\n\nLow point: Rambling closing remarks in which she admitted to MEPs that she hadn\u2019t really focused much on the topics in her new portfolio until she was nominated a few weeks ago.\n\nKey quote: \u201cI think that someone\u2019s private beliefs are not relevant to their job.\u201d (When questioned about her views on abortion.)\n\nVerdict: Shaky showing, but enough to win confirmation to a post that\u2019s unlikely to be key in the new Commission. Durand described her as \u201cjust sufficient but hardly inspiring\u201d \u2014 and that was after she\u2019d wished him a happy birthday.\n\nRating: \u2b50\u2b50\n\nJanusz Wojciechowski (Agriculture, Poland)\n\nHigh point: In his second hearing, he won a warm round of applause for choosing to speak in Polish, after struggling in English in the first session.\n\nLow point: After the agonizing first hearing, when lawmakers were invited to applaud, they remained silent.\n\nKey quote: \u201cI was raised on a farm!\u201d\n\nVerdict: Wojciechowski came across as vague and overly keen to give answers that pleased everyone, but the lawmakers knew that he had experience in agriculture and feared that Poland could send a worse candidate if he were rejected.\n\nRating: \u2b50\u2b50\n\nSylvie Goulard (Internal market, France)\n\nHigh point: Solid on policy but that didn't count for much, in two hearings.\n\nLow points: Too many to give all of them a mention. Faced repeated questions about an investigation into possible misuse of EU funds for payments to a Parliament assistant, and about her highly paid side gig with a U.S think tank. \u201cHow many French people earn \u20ac13,000 for making phone calls?\u201d asked Virginie Joron, from the French far-right National Rally. Lowest point of all was her rejection by Parliament\u2019s internal market and industry committees on Thursday.\n\nKey quote: \"I am clean.\" (from her first hearing)\n\nVerdict: Emmanuel Macron\u2019s pick was unconvincing, but she may also have been doomed before she entered the room. Many MEPs, especially those from the European People\u2019s Party, seemed to have decided from the start that she was going down.\n\nRating: \u2b50\n\nPOLITICO's Statlers and Waldorfs: Jacopo Barigazzi, Lili Bayer, Hannah Brenton, Hanne Cokelaere, Cristina Gonzalez, Laura Greenhalgh, Andrew Gray, Anca Gurzu, Jakob Hanke, Melissa Heikkil\u00e4, Laura Kayali, Thibault Larger, Christian Oliver, John Rega, Eline Schaart, Bjarke Smith-Meyer, Marion Solletty, Paola Tamma, Sarah Wheaton.", "description": "From star performers to strugglers \u2014 every confirmation session, super-abbreviated and rated.", "authors": ["Louise Guillot", "David M.
