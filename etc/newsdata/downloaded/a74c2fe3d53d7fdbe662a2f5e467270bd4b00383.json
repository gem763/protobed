REUTERS/Ammar Awad\n\nThe move is the government\u2019s latest step to try to check the protests following Chief Executive Carrie Lam\u2019s decision earlier this month to invoke colonial-era emergency measures to outlaw face masks, used by protesters to hide their identity and withstand tear gas.\n\nLam said on Tuesday that while every means should be considered to quell unrest, concessions to the protesters in the face of escalating violence would make matters worse.\n\n\u201cI have said on many occasions that violence will not give us the solution. Violence would only breed more violence,\u201d Lam told a news conference.\n\nDemonstrators have besieged and hurled petrol bombs at police housing areas in the Chinese-ruled city, damaging facilities, police said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nThe injunction on protests in police housing areas also prohibits the obstruction of roads and bans people from shining laser pens or other flash lights at police facilities.\n\nIn August, after protesters mobbed the Hong Kong airport and brought it to a standstill, the High Court issued an injunction banning anti-government protesters from targeting what is one of the world\u2019s busiest airports.\n\nProtesters, many masked and wearing black, have thrown petrol bombs at police and central government offices, stormed the Legislative Council, blocked roads to the airport, trashed metro stations and lit fires on the streets of the Asian financial centre.\n\nPolice have responded with tear gas, water cannons, rubber bullets, bean-bag rounds and several live rounds, warning the crowds beforehand with a series of coloured banners.\n\nThe government refuses to concede to the protesters\u2019 demand for an independent inquiry into accusations of police brutality. Police, who have beaten protesters on the ground with batons, say they have shown restraint.\n\nProtesters have also called for universal suffrage, but on Tuesday the South China Morning Post reported that Lam had told the European Union\u2019s representative in Hong Kong there was nothing to be gained by opening a discussion on that topic because it could not be delivered at present.\n\nThe protests began in opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed suspects to be sent to China, but have broadened into a pro-democracy movement amid fears that Beijing is undermining Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms.\n\nBritain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula, which gives it wide-ranging autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\nTens of thousands of mostly young pro-democracy activists pleaded for help from the United States on Monday evening in the first legal protest since the mask ban took effect on Oct. 5.\n\nU.S. Senator Ted Cruz spoke in support of the protest movement on the weekend, in the highest profile visit by a U.S. politician since the unrest broke out.\n\nCruz said there was \u201coverwhelming bipartisan support\u201d in the U.S. Congress for the people of Hong Kong and called on the Senate to pass the Hong Kong Human Rights Act to allow sanctions on those who undermine the city\u2019s autonomy.\n\nHong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam speaks to journalists before a weekly Executive Council meeting in Hong Kong, China, October 15, 2019.

Rumours have swirled that the government might postpone the election due to the protests.\n\nLam said the government wanted to hold \u201cfair, open, honest\u201d elections, although attacks on offices of pro-establishment politicians by protesters had cast a shadow over the vote.", "description": "A Hong Kong court has granted an injunction to ban anyone from blocking or damaging areas used to house married police officers and other disciplined services that have been targeted in more than four months of anti-government protests.", "authors": ["Donny Kwok", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1440978755&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E06Y", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
