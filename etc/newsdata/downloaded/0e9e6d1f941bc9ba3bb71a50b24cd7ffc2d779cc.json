Rescue crews on Tuesday were still searching for those missing, thought to number about 20.\n\nDon't Miss 217 SHARES 258 SHARES 479 SHARES 264 SHARES 1.4 K SHARES\n\nSome 34,000 homes were without power and 110,000 lacked running water. More than 30,000 people were still at shelters as of late Monday, according to the Cabinet Office's latest tally.\n\nBusiness appeared nearly back to normal in central Tokyo, and residents in areas where floodwater subsided started cleaning up. Lives, however, remained paralyzed in Nagano, Fukishima and other hard-hit areas that were still inundated.\n\nSome residents in Nagano returned to their homes, only to find they not be habitable.\n\nREUTERS\n\nRetired carpenter Toshitaka Yoshimura, who grew up in the Tsuno district of Nagano, was stunned when he returned to his home after staying at an evacuation center during the storm.\n\nHis house was a mess. Doors were knocked out, his handmade furniture was tossed around and damaged, and everything from a futon to electronics were broken and covered with mud.\n\n\u201cI put a lot of effort in this house. I made all the furniture with my wife. Now look what happened in one day,'' he said, with his voice trembling with emotion.\n\n\u201cNow this makes me want to cry.\u201d\n\nAt least some of his memorable photos with his family and relatives were intact, along with toys and games that his younger relatives played when they gathered at his house.\n\n\u201cI'm glad they survived at least,'' said his nephew Kazuki Yoshimura. \u201cPerhaps we can still do something about the house, but nothing can be more precious than life.''\n\nREUTERS\n\nIn Fukushima, 11 bags containing possibly radioactive soil and debris removed as part of decontamination efforts from the 2011 meltdown of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, were washed from two outdoor temporary storage sites and found downstream, the Environment Ministry said.\n\nThere was no risk to the environment because the waterproof bags were intact and hadn't leaked, the ministry said. It said, however, officials will take preventive measures ahead of future rainstorms.\n\nA massive number of such bags are still being kept at 760 similar sites across Fukushima. Their transfer to a longer-term storage facility near the plant is expected to be completed by March 2022.\n\nWith AP Inputs", "description": "Japan is considering to approve a special budget for the disaster response and eventual reconstruction as the toll of death and destruction from a typhoon that tore through central and northern Japan continues to climb.
