But there is one major spoiler ahead.\n\nLots of folks had real problems with the military tactics deployed in last week\u2019s battle with the dead. I was okay with it, in part because I liked the epic, almost mystical, choreography of the battle. A little poetic license was ok.\n\nBut the loss of Rhaegal was a Bay of Pigs level failure on the part of Dany\u2019s advisors and generals. She would be within her rights to sh*t-can all of them.\n\nTyrion, who\u2019d been humiliated by not one, but two, catastrophic surprise naval attacks just last year \u2014 and was almost fired for it \u2014 took no care to anticipate anything like this?\n\nThere were no scouts up ahead who could have warned that Euron was hiding his ships behind a big rock? Who could imagine such clever tactics?\n\nVarys, the former Master of Whispers, with a spy in every grotto, bedchamber, and hamlet, didn\u2019t get an inkling something like this might happen? Presumably the mass manufacture and installation of so many \u201cscorpions\u201d \u2014 those giant crossbow things \u2014 was common enough knowledge. I mean how secret can you keep these weapons if they\u2019re being wheeled through the streets down to the docks and installed on the battlements?\n\nAlso, did they really leave absolutely no one at Dragonstone who could send a raven or two when a whole enemy fleet shows up for an ambush? Come on people! This is a war!\n\nViserion\u2019s death by ice spear was at least fairly unforeseeable. But they knew Cersei was working on a way to kill the dragons. They\u2019d seen a scorpion before. Maybe adopt a general rule that the dragons should fly at higher altitudes until the landing strip is secured?\n\nAnyway, maybe I\u2019ll chime in on the rest of it later.
