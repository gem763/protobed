Indeed, John Howard, one of a handful of world leaders to support the invasion and send troops, said back then that regime change was insufficient reason for the war.\n\nThe invasion was justified on ginned-up intelligence about non-existent weapons of mass destruction and a falsehood that somehow Iraq played a role in the September 11, 2001 attacks, when they were actually carried out and funded by Saudis based in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cHaving been attacked by al-Qaeda, for us now to go bombing Iraq in response would be like our invading Mexico after the Japanese attacked us at Pearl Harbor,'' Bush's counter-terror tsar Richard Clarke wrote in his scathing book titled Against All Enemies.\n\nRegime change became the fallback after the original reasons vanished.\n\nToday, the consequences of that war, especially the power vacuum it created, continue to influence foreign policy in the Middle East.\n\nIt is frequently argued that destabilisation of the region caused by the invasion \u2013 with no plan for how to deal with the aftermath \u2013 gave rise to the spread in popularity of al-Qaeda and the establishment of Islamic State. It also hampered the effort in Afghanistan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump's ad hoc decision this week to withdraw US forces from northern Syria and thus give Turkish strongman Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan the green light to invade and exterminate the Kurds was simplistically and carelessly described by Scott Morrison on Wednesday as Trump doing no more than keeping a promise.\n\n\"[It was] almost a year ago that President Trump first started to outline his views on the ongoing role of the United States in Syria and for that matter in Afghanistan and Iraq, and so that has been a point that he's been making for some time, and I think it would be wrong to not draw an element of consistency between those statements almost a year ago and the actions the United States have been taking since including most recently,\" he said.\n\nA day later, the Prime Minister was forced to mop up amid perceptions his response had been callously ambiguous.\n\nAustralia had expressed \"deep concerns\" to both the Turks and the Americans, over not only the welfare of the Kurds but the potential of the unprovoked Turkish invasion to rekindle Islamic State, he said.\n\nYet his language was aimed at Turkey, not Trump.\n\nOne foe at a time\n\nThe Kurds, who fought bravely alongside US troops to defeat IS, cannot keep the terrorist outfit at bay while being attacked by the Turks \u2013 with the silent imprimatur of Washington.\n\nTrump is a leader who confounds attempts to pigeonhole him because he is neither conservative nor progressive. Some of his instincts are conservative, many are protectionist and populist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is often overlooked that one of the reasons he won power in 2016 was because of his strong condemnation of George W. Bush's unfunded wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThose rust-belt voters who supported Trump on the promise he would restore their jobs and factories came from the thousands of small towns whose sons and daughters were sent to those wars, and who returned in coffins or physically or mentally maimed.\n\nTrump opposed the wars because they cost too much in blood and treasure. He does not believe in America being the global policeman. His campaign barbs were aimed as much at Bush but were used principally against his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton who, as a New York senator, had voted for the Iraq war in 2003.\n\nAs recently as a few weeks ago, while meeting Morrison in the Oval Office, Trump had to reinforce his anti-war credentials when fending off questions premised on the assumption he wanted to launch military action against Iran.\n\n\"I remember during the debates and when I was running against Hillary and the Democrats and the media ... everybody said, 'Oh, he's going to get into war, he's going to get into war, he's going to blow everybody up, he's going to get into war','' he said.\n\n\"Well, the easiest thing I could do, in fact, I could do it while you're here, would [be to] say, 'Go ahead, fellas, go do it.'\n\n\"For all of those that say 'oh, they should do it', it shows weakness, it just actually, in my opinion, it shows strength.''\n\nEven now, as he defends giving Turkey the green light to invade northern Syria, he is warning Istanbul only of economic sanctions should it step out of line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing anti-war is all well and good, but the US President also has a duty to help clean up the mess his country helped create and, moreover, look after loyal allies.\n\nTrump demands that good allies lift their weight militarily, a point Morrison made repeatedly while in US by referring to Australia spending 2 per cent of its GDP on defence.\n\nWell, the Kurds have lifted their weight more than anyone, yet it means nothing to Trump.\n\nHis dismissal of the Kurds on Thursday by saying that they \"didn\u2019t help us in the Second World War, they didn\u2019t help us with Normandy\" was staggering.\n\nThere is a warning in this to all allies, NATO countries and Australia included \u2013 the US cannot be relied upon while Trump is at the helm.", "description": "By giving Turkey the green light to attack Syrian Kurds, the US President has once again demonstrated his unreliability as an ally.
