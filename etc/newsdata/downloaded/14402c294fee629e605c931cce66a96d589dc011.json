after his newspaper ran a story accusing his old party of misleading the public.\n\nHe tweeted: \u201cI think you\u2019ll find the team at the Evening Standard know the difference between a bill passing its second reading in the Commons and a bill passing parliament.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s been a while since the latter happened, but I\u2019m happy to come in and explain how it\u2019s

It is not, however, an indication of the complete legislative programme. I don't think that's an unduly difficult concept.\"\n\nA Conservative Party spokesperson said: \"MPs have passed the new deal that the prime minister negotiated with the EU at second reading, but sadly parliament and Jeremy Corbyn are still delaying actually getting Brexit done once and for all.\n\n\"Only the Conservatives are committed to getting Brexit done so we can focus on domestic priorities like more police on the streets and investing in the NHS, and finally allowing the country to move on.\u201d", "description": "The Conservative party has been embroiled in a fake news row over social media posts claiming Boris Johnson's\u00a0Brexit deal had been approved by MPs.
