The width and level at which the band was centred was unchanged.\n\nThe Singapore dollar rose slightly against the US dollar on the day.\n\n\"It's a slight reduction in the rate of appreciation. They did not say the policy was neutral so it suggests that the slope is still positive,\" said Barclays economist Brian Tan.", "description": "Singapore has, like other trade-reliant Asian economies, been hit hard by the escalating US-China trade war and a broader global slowdown.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5295%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_98/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/af632b8e8de6684e302d435a53baa92a6b544b76", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
