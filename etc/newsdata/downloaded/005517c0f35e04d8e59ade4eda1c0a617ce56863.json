Something went not like he wanted, it is not the substitution.\n\n\u201cHe was upset but that\u2019s all. That was obvious. You cannot hide his emotions, I like that, but all sorted. We spoke about it, everything is fine.\n\n\u201cWe are individuals, we are emotional. It was a situation in a game, what else could happen? It was not a phone call. It was a situation in the game he was not happy about but that\u2019s completely fine.\n\n\u201cWould he do it exactly the same manner again? Probably not, but it happened. He didn\u2019t say any wrong words, it just looked a little bit different to how he looks usually.\n\n\u201cFor me, of course I can understand that\u2019s a little story. Thank God we are now away for a week so if you write something about it we will not read it anyway, and after a week nobody can remember it anymore.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool. A good moment to do it. It\u2019s all good really, all fine.\u201d", "description": "Jurgen Klopp claimed that Sadio Mane is simply an \u201cemotional guy\u201d after the Liverpool\u00a0forward appeared to be unhappy with Mohamed Salah\u2019s failure to pass to him against Burnley.
