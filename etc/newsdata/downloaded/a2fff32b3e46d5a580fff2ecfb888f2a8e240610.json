Look at everything that has happened, he doesn\u2019t want to leave,\u201d said Franco Garcia, 21, adding he voted for Mesa, a former president, because he would be easier to topple if needed.\n\n\u201cIf we continue with Evo, then something like Venezuela awaits us. He has too much power.\u201d\n\nThe unrest began after an official quick vote count was disrupted by a day-long halt starting late on Sunday, when the count of almost 84% of ballots showed the two main rivals heading to a second round.\n\nRelated Coverage Bolivia's Morales calls on military to unite amid turmoil over disputed election\n\nThe tensions mark the most severe challenge to Morales\u2019 rule since he took office in 2006 as the country\u2019s first indigenous leader.\n\n\u2018COUP D\u2019ETAT\u2019\n\nIn a fiery speech earlier at the government office in the capital, La Paz, Morales criticized recent violence that saw electoral offices torched and skirmishes between protesters and police, which he blamed on the right-wing opposition and what he described as their foreign backers.\n\n\u201cI have called this conference to denounce, in front of the Bolivian people and the entire world, that a coup d\u2019etat is in progress. In advance, the right had prepared with international support for a coup,\u201d he said.\n\nMorales called on the people to \u201cdefend democracy.\u201d Later in the day, he sought to shore up backing from the country\u2019s military at an event in the region of Cochabamba, a key source of political support.\n\nAt an evening news conference, government minister Carlos Romero denounced \u201cviolent groups,\u201d which he said were seeking to confront police with explosives, adding the government would look to hold responsible those promoting the violence.\n\nMesa, in a video statement on Wednesday, called for \u201cpermanent protests\u201d until a second-round vote was confirmed, and said he would present evidence of electoral fraud.\n\nBolivia's President Evo Morales speaks during a news conference at the presidential palace La Casa Grande del Pueblo in La Paz, Bolivia, October 23, 2019.

On Monday night, some electoral offices were set ablaze.\n\n\u2018WHAT\u2019S HE AFRAID OF?\u2019\n\nMorales, the former union leader for coca farmers, has overseen relative stability and growth in one of South America\u2019s poorest countries, but angered many by running for a fourth consecutive term in defiance of term limits and a 2016 referendum that voted against him doing so.\n\n\u201cIf he wants to be elected cleanly, he should accept a second-round election. What\u2019s he afraid of?\u201d asked Maria Luz Vargas, 65, a newspaper seller in La Paz who closed up her kiosk to join the protests.\n\nThe official election monitor, the Organization of American States, had called the count into question and cited a \u201cdrastic\u201d and inexplicable shift in the vote, which it said hurt voters\u2019 confidence in the electoral process.\n\nAntonio Costas, one of the six-member electoral team coordinating the vote, stepped down on Tuesday in protest at the halt to the rapid count, although he told Reuters he had not come under political pressure.\n\nAt a meeting on Wednesday, the OAS said Morales could not claim victory and it recommended a second-round vote even if he reached a 10-point lead.\n\nA number of foreign governments, including the United States, Brazil and the European Union, voiced concerns about the integrity of the vote.\n\nSlideshow (17 Images)\n\nMorales called on his supporters, especially in rural areas, to help \u201cdefend democracy,\u201d adding he was convinced that when the final vote count was announced, he would have a clear first-round win.\n\n\u201cOur triumph has always been with the votes from the rural areas with the votes of the indigenous movement,\u201d he said, adding he would respect the final result.", "description": "Bolivian leader Evo Morales, again claiming victory in the country's fraught presidential election, accused the opposition on Wednesday of trying to orchestrate a coup after anti-government protests that charged the vote counting was rigged.", "authors": ["Mitra Taj", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444163737&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1IC", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
