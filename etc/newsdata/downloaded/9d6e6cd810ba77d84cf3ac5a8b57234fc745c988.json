They were holding hands and he held her close while opening doors for her when they stepped outside to get to their table. They were in zero rush and were there for over an hour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He requested a table outside to enjoy the weather. No one recognised him or most of the other patrons played dumb because they weren\u2019t bugging him or them at all.\u2019\n\nAfter hiding out in Byron Bay for weeks following his split from Miley in August, 29-year-old Liam was papped in the US with the 22-year-old actress, best known for playing Kirby Anders on the Dynasty reboot, and also had a role in Strangerland opposite Nicole Kidman.\n\nEven though the pair weren\u2019t making out \u2013 after all, he is a gentleman as aforementioned source said \u2013 there was no question the pair were into one another.\n\nMiley is loved up with Cody Simpson (Picture: Instagram)\n\nThe source continued: \u2018Never was there any time they were making out but they were in constant conversation.\n\n\u2018There was no lull period between conversations or laughter, any time food or drink was delivered they were knee deep in conversation and very involved in each other and whatever they were talking about. They were definitely getting along. When they left he reached for her hand and she took it. They were having a really good time.\u2019\n\nThe pair are said to be taking things slow with their \u2018very new\u2019 relationship, although a source told People magazine recently Liam is \u2018definitely interested\u2019 in the Dynasty actress.\n\nMeanwhile, Miley is also in a new relationship with Aussie musician Cody Simpson. Prior to dating Cody, the singer was dating long-time friend Kaitlynn Carter just a month after her and Liam announced their split.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLiam seemed to be having a lot of fun with Maddison as they headed out following their lunch and flouted their previous rule of no PDA.\n\nThe happy couple were pictured enjoying a very handsy moment after an evening of drinks at The Flower Shop bar with pals, before Maddison was seen bending over backwards as Liam nuzzled into her neck.\n\nClutching his new potential-girlfriend on the hips, Liam then passionately kissed Maddison who wrapped her arms around his neck.\n\nThe two were seen with friends, and later Liam appeared to take things a step further when he picked up a traffic cone and tried to carry it on one shoulder.\n\nLove, right?\n\nGot a showbiz story?
