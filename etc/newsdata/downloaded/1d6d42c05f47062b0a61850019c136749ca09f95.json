It can't be shut down.\u201d\n\nIn an embedded video, McAfee argues that the cryptocurrency community faces the question of whether its aspirations are limited to merely expanding the possibilities for pure speculation \u2014 \u201call about money\u201d \u2014 or are about an ideal, namely freedom.\n\nAfter denouncing governments\u2019 control over fiat currencies and the losses this presents to individual liberty, McAfee turned to the crypto space: \u201ccentralized exchanges are our weak point,\u201d he said, pointing to China\u2019s move to shutter domestic exchanges in September 2017.\n\nMcAfee continued:\n\n\u201cA distributed exchange can\u2019t be shut down by anyone. Decentralized meaning that nobody controls it, distributed meaning that it is everywhere and therefore impossible to stop. We\u2019ve had privacy coins, that\u2019s the other part of this equation, because privacy coins with decentralized, distributed exchanges is the goose that lays the golden egg for us. We don\u2019t use it though.\u201d\n\nMcAfee DEX beta: the details\n\nAccording to the details released so far, McAfee DEX reportedly will entail no Know Your Customer checks, block no jurisdictions and charge a single platform fee of 0.25% for takers. It will not charge maker fees and will also reportedly be open sourced.\n\nAny ETH-based token (ERC-20 standard) can be added without a fee to the beta version, with more unspecified tokens to be supported in the future.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t expect miracles\u201d\n\nIn his Oct. 5 video, McAfee pointed to the low number of traders currently using decentralized exchanges, considering that this makes them \u201cuseless.\u201d For his DEX, McAfee urged users:\n\n\u201cPlay with it, don\u2019t expect miracles at first. Play with it until it becomes real.\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph previously reported, non-custodial decentralized crypto exchanges enable users to trade peer-to-peer, using smart contracts to automate deal matching and asset liquidation in order to allow users\u2019 funds to remain under their control.\n\nAs of January 2019, a survey of over 400 international crypto exchanges indicated that decentralized platforms accounted for just 19% of the global exchange ecosystem, and their trading volumes amounted to less than 1% of those on centralized exchanges.\n\nThis April, major centralized exchange Binance launched its own DEX on its native mainnet. Other major exchanges eyeing their own DEX include OKEx and Bithumb.", "description": "American entrepreneur and vocal crypto advocate John McAfee launches a new decentralized exchange on the Ethereum blockchain", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMTg4ZDE2MWQ4YWJiMzk0ZDEzN2Y3YTA2Mjg1OWRiMTkuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
