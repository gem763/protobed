Subsequently, the network fired Lauer from his position on Today.\n\nAt the time, Nevils\u2019 identity was kept anonymous at her request; this is the first time the full details of her allegations have been made public.\n\nBut prosecution of Lauer is unlikely, legal experts tell PEOPLE. One reason is that Russian authorities would have to prosecute the case and request that Lauer be extradited from the United States, but Russia and the U.S. don\u2019t have an extradition treaty.\n\n\u201cIt would be virtually impossible [the United States] would send someone [to Russia] to face charges,\u201d David Glazier, a law professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, tells PEOPLE.\n\nGlazier says that sometimes countries without extradition treaties agree to cooperate with each other, but he says it\u2019s \u201cnot common for the U.S. to do so.\u201d\n\nJulian Ku, a law professor at Hofstra University in New York state, tells PEOPLE that in general, United States prosecutors can\u2019t punish American citizens for acts committed in other countries, even if the acts were committed against other U.S. citizens.\n\nSome exceptions to this rule exist, like sex tourism involving minors. But Ku says, \u201cI don\u2019t think they would apply here.\u201d\n\nGlazier says prosecuting Lauer would be difficult because Nevils didn\u2019t contact Russian authorities at the time.\n\nRELATED: Everything We Know About the Allegations Against Matt Lauer\n\n\u201cThey would be starting completely from scratch in terms of any kind of investigation, so, first of all, she would have to go to Russia, presumably. Second, the Russian government would have to be sympathetic enough to her case that they would be willing to meet with her, and then they would have to decide if it qualifies under Russian law,\u201d he says.\n\n\u2022 Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

Two years ago, President Vladimir Putin signed a law decriminalizing many forms of domestic violence. The Washington Post reports that the penalty for a first offense that results in bruising or bleeding for the victim, but not broken bones, is a small fine or a 15-day prison sentence.\n\nOn whether Russian authorities would even pursue the case and seek Lauer\u2019s extradition, Glazier says, \u201cI think it\u2019s a remote possibility.\u201d\n\nAccuser Alleges She \u2018Declined Several Times\u2019 Before Lauer \u2018Just Did It\u2019", "description": "'Virtually Impossible' Matt Lauer Is Prosecuted for Rape: Experts", "authors": ["Christine Pelisek"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Z03_byps5RbEG5ZBDhAZNw--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/586e36af73652bf4319c5ff544f2ef4b", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
