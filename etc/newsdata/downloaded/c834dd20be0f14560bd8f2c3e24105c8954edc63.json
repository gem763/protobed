If you want to learn about the risks in an ICO and how to minimize them, this a quick guide is the right place to start.\n\nWhy Are ICOs Risky?\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is still under-regulated. That means investors may be left on their own if an ICO turns out to be a fraud or the project fails. Neither of these scenarios is uncommon, and with immutable transactions and insufficient regulations, you can only trust yourself to make the right financial decisions.\n\nOn the other hand, the holders of an ICO may end up trapped by financial regulations, too. For example, many ICOs had to be moved or delayed due to infamous China\u2019s ban on ICOs and exchanges back in 2017.\n\nICO Buyers Risks\n\nAs you can see, both ICO organizers and investors have to face many potential risks. On the buyers' side of things these include:\n\nInvesting in relatively inexperienced teams with an unproven (experimental) business model and a high risk of default.\n\nNo regulatory protection.\n\nLimited transparency regarding project progress and issues.\n\nThe risk of investing in an elaborate scam or pump and dump scheme.\n\nIt may be difficult to grasp the full picture of the ICO before you invest.\n\nThe value of ICO tokens can be purely speculative and experience wild fluctuations.\n\nThe hype of an ICO may surpass its actual utility.\n\nICO Organizers Risks\n\nAt the site time, ICO owners take a risk due to:\n\nUncertain regulations which may result in fines, extra costs, or sentences.\n\nUncertain regulatory difference between utility and security tokens.\n\nUnstable investment currencies that may devalue extremely fast.\n\nLittle to none information about the token holders.\n\nThe interest in ICOs has been waning ever since early 2018.\n\nResponsibility if projects security is compromised and it ends up harming the investors.\n\nRisk of issuing incorrect documentation in regulated states.\n\nAs a result, both ICO organizers and potential investors need to consider the risks carefully.\n\nIt\u2019s not, in fact, rare for ICO teams to merely run off with investors\u2019 money, and it\u2019s not rare for ICOs to receive fines and regulatory obstacles after they ended. But that doesn\u2019t mean that all ICO\u2019s are invalid and should be avoided. There are still some decent projects out there, but you need to separate the wheat from the chaff.\n\nHow To Identify Fraudulent ICOs\n\nIf you see an ICO project you want to invest and would like to minimize the risk while doing so, look out for the potential red flags:\n\n- The people behind the project are anonymous, use fake identities or have counterfeit accounts on social networks.\n\n- The team lacks professionals with relevant experience.\n\n- There is no legal entity behind the ICO.\n\n- The whitepaper and business plan sound unrealistic and/or lack a detailed analysis of the market and competitors.\n\n- The project\u2019s authors do not provide an example of their blockchain code.\n\n- There is no working prototype.\n\n- There is no escrow wallet for delivering investors\u2019 money to developers (preferably in portions) only when certain criteria are met.\n\n- The project doesn\u2019t commit any code to Github.\n\n- The project doesn\u2019t have a clear roadmap.\n\n- There is little to none credible PR or media activity or positive mentions of the project.\n\n- The token or blockchain doesn\u2019t seem necessary to reach the project\u2019s goals.\n\nAt the end of the day, you have to do your own research and figure out for yourself whether the ICO is credible or not. Try to avoid projects with numerous red flags or the ones which are located in uncertain regulatory environments, and your ICO investment should turn out just fine.\n\nPrevious - Why invest in an ICO?\n\nNext - What is Bitcoin?\n\nHave any suggestions about this entry?Let us know.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/guides/0//", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
