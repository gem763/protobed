REUTERS/Anushree Fadnavis/File Photo\n\nIndia slashed its headline corporate tax rate to 22% from 30% on Friday in a surprise gambit aimed at wooing manufacturers and boosting investment in Asia\u2019s third-biggest economy, where unemployment has surged as growth sinks to six-year lows.\n\nThe country is currently vying with rivals like Vietnam to attract global firms such as Apple and encourage contract manufacturers like Foxconn and Wistron to step up their presence. China\u2019s trade tussle with the United States, which is pushing smartphone makers to seek alternative markets, is giving that fight an additional edge.\n\n\u201cThis is a clear signal from the government to boost investors\u2019 confidence in India\u2019s economy,\u201d said Vikas Agarwal, India head of China\u2019s OnePlus, which makes its smartphones locally and rivals Apple for a share of India\u2019s premium device segment.\n\n\u201cIt will directly affect a company\u2019s profitability, help fuel consumption \u2014 but more importantly it also reflects India\u2019s ambitions.\u201d\n\nThe trade war between Beijing and Washington has led to higher tariffs on goods worth tens of billions of dollars and disrupted global supply chains, pushing companies to look at newer markets to escape higher tariffs.\n\nAnd India has already begun stepping up efforts to attract investment, especially in labour-intensive electronics manufacturing.\n\nNew Delhi last week scrapped a tax on imports of open cell TV panels, used to make television displays, in a move likely to boost television manufacturing in the country.\n\nINVESTING IN INDIA\n\nThe arrival of global players has made India the world\u2019s No. 2 mobile phone maker and the smartphone industry is central to Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s ambitious \u201cMake in India\u201d drive.\n\nFriday\u2019s announcement also cut taxes for any manufacturing firm incorporated on or after Oct. 1 and beginning production by March 2023 to an even lower rate of 17% \u2014 less than rival countries.\n\nThat should help charm contract manufacturers that do not already have a presence in the South Asian country, such as Taiwan\u2019s Pegatron and other firms which make higher-end electronics components.\n\nThe four senior smartphone industry executives said it was too early to speculate about how much more money their companies would commit to investing following the tax cut.\n\nBut Indian smartphone maker Lava and China\u2019s Xiaomi said the cut would help them generate more employment and step up investments in local R&D.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful that we will be able to bring more of our component suppliers to India and help boost the local manufacturing industry further,\u201d said a spokeswoman for Beijing-based Xiaomi, India\u2019s top smartphone player.\n\nIt makes 99% percent of its devices locally through contract manufacturers and recently helped its supplier Holitech \u2014 a maker of camera modules and other parts \u2014 to set up a plant in northern India.\n\nThe tax cut will help draw makers of components like phone display panels, lithium cells and camera modules, industry executives and analysts said, also citing a jump for India in a global index that ranks countries by ease of doing business.\n\n\u201cEarlier, India\u2019s corporate tax rate was among the highest in the world. The new tax rate brings it at par with other leading manufacturing economies such as the U.S. and China,\u201d said one of the smartphone industry executives, who asked not to be named due to company policy. \u201cThe central bank now needs to cut lending rates by 75-100 basis points to fuel growth.\u201d\n\nWhile it is hard to calculate the benefits for individual companies, the lower tax rate will mean better profit margins for companies such as Apple and OnePlus which sell high-value phones, Rushabh Doshi of technology research firm Canalys said.\n\nExecutives warn, however, that investors remain wary of India\u2019s policy flip-flops, red tape, poor logistics infrastructure and cumbersome land-acquisition procedures.\n\n\u201cRight now is the window of opportunity for India to come up with as many incentives as possible to draw attention,\u201d Shih-Chung Liu, vice chairman of Taiwan\u2019s External Trade Development Council, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThis is a good start, but it is just one major incentive.\u201d", "description": "India's lower corporate tax rate will help its smartphone industry expand, fuel research and development (R&D) investment and attract higher-value component makers to the world's second-biggest smartphone market, four top industry executives said.", "authors": ["Sankalp Phartiyal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432977376&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M18C", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
