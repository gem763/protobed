He could also establish a formal coalition, in which parties share cabinet seats, but such arrangements are rare in Canada. Both the third-place separatist Bloc Quebecois and the fourth-place New Democratic Party appeared to have enough seats to help the Liberals stay in power.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe first test of a minority government is the Speech from the Throne, in which the leader puts forth his agenda, and it\u2019s put to a vote. If Trudeau loses, his government collapses. The governor general, who represents the queen of England in Canada, could then call on other parties to try to form a government to avoid another election.\n\nThe vote Monday capped an acrimonious contest dominated by scandal and personal attacks. Polls throughout the six-week campaign showed Trudeau\u2019s Liberals in a dead heat with Scheer\u2019s Conservatives, a competition that would have seemed far-fetched when Trudeau came to power four years ago, riding a wave of support reminiscent of the enthusiasm for his father, longtime Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, a generation earlier.\n\nBut unkept promises and scandal blunted the telegenic Liberal leader\u2019s prospects. He cast himself as a steward of the environment but bought an oil pipeline last year for $3.4 billion. Jody Wilson-Raybould, his former attorney general and the first indigenous woman in that role, accused him and his senior aides this year of improperly pressuring her to interfere in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, a Quebec-based construction giant. Last month, images and a video of a younger Trudeau in brownface and blackface damaged his reputation as a champion of diversity. He apologized, repeatedly.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t even remember how many times he put blackface on, because the fact of the matter is he\u2019s always wearing a mask,\u201d Scheer, 40, crowed during one debate.\n\nBut Canadians did not appear to warm to Scheer, a \u201cpro-Brexit before it was cool\u201d father of five, who struggled to expand support for the Conservatives outside their base and failed to capitalize on Trudeau\u2019s missteps. He drew criticism for his opposition to abortion, his refusal to say whether he still opposed same-sex marriage, and for the revelation late in the race that he held U.S. citizenship \u2014 after he and his party had criticized other lawmakers for their dual citizenship.\n\nIn Quebec, a province known for large swings from one election to the next, the resurgence of the once moribund Bloc Quebecois after years of internal strife was one of the surprises of the campaign. Yves-Francois Blanchet, the former rock group manager who leads the party, told supporters in Montreal that he believed that Canadians wanted all of the parties to work together \u201cdespite the deep divisions\u201d of the electoral map.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJagmeet Singh\u2019s New Democratic Party trailed the Bloc Quebecois with 25 seats, but was still in a position to hold the balance of power in a minority government.\n\nBefore the election, the Green Party appeared poised for a breakthrough given concern about climate change in Canada and dissatisfaction with the Liberal government\u2019s record on the environment. But Elizabeth May\u2019s party won only one new seat, bringing the party\u2019s total seats in Parliament to three.\n\nThere were a few other notable results.\n\nWilson-Raybould, who was booted from caucus after the SNC-Lavalin affair, ran as an independent in British Columbia \u2014 and won. Maxime Bernier, the former Conservative lawmaker who quit the party last year to form the hard-right People\u2019s Party of Canada in 2018, lost his seat.\n\nAD\n\nIn Mississauga, Ontario, an ethnically diverse, middle-class Toronto suburb, about two dozen voters lined up outside a gymnasium at St. Jude Separate School early Monday waiting for the polls to open. A kindergarten teacher explained to her wide-eyed students: \u201cThey\u2019re picking our prime minister.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut for Moez Mawani, the campaign was uninspiring. The retired business owner voted for the incumbent Liberal candidate in his district, but with no great enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cIt was a matter of picking the better of the two evils,\u201d he said.\n\nTerence Norton, a retired director of a pharmaceutical company, opted for the Conservative challenger. He said the Conservatives would \u201cput more money in the pockets of average Canadians.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNawal Khokhar said she voted with the future of her young daughter in mind. The 28-year-old business consultant cast a ballot for Navdeep Bains, the local Liberal candidate, who was innovation minister in Trudeau\u2019s cabinet. She said she was not wooed by the Conservatives\u2019 promise of tax cuts.\n\n\u201cAm I okay with getting a little bit better of a tax cut today but having my child grow up in an environment that isn\u2019t as inclusive?\u201d she asked. \u201cThat\u2019s really my choice.\u201d\n\nSimon Malevich, a graduate student at the University of Toronto, was one of the 4.7 million people who voted early. He cast a ballot for the Conservatives in 2015, but has since had a \u201cchange of heart\u201d \u2014 this time, he voted for the New Democratic Party.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Justin Trudeau has lived up to the promises that he made in 2015,\u201d said Malevich, 24. \u201cI\u2019m worried about inaction on climate change. I don\u2019t think it was a good idea that we bought a pipeline.\u201d\n\nHe said the campaign left much to be desired.\n\n\u201cThis election hasn\u2019t been about policy ideas between the two major parties,\u201d Malevich said. \u201cIt has been about \u2018gotcha\u2019 moments.\u201d\n\nCanada\u2019s federal elections watchdog said last week that 29 percent more people voted early than in 2015. It was the first federal election since the Supreme Court ruled in January that expats have the right to vote no matter how long they have lived outside Canada.Previously, Canadians who had lived abroad for more than five years were ineligible.\n\nAD\n\nCanadians complained that the campaign was heavy on name-calling and light on issues. Trudeau wore a bulletproof vest at a rally in Mississauga this month after a security threat. He accused his Conservative foes of running the \u201cnastiest\u201d campaign in the country\u2019s history.\n\nAD\n\nAt a packed rally in Richmond Hill, Ontario, over the weekend, Scheer supporters aimed a chant of \u201clock him up\u201d at Trudeau. Scheer tried to turn the chant to \u201cvote him out.\u201d\n\nCanada\u2019s foreign signals intelligence agency said this year that \u201csome form\u201d of foreign cyber interference in the election was \u201cvery likely.\u201d The government established a panel of nonpartisan senior bureaucrats to monitor attempts at interference and to notify the public about serious incidents. It made no such announcements.\n\nIn a tweet early Tuesday, President Trump congratulated Trudeau for \u201ca wonderful and hard-fought victory.\u201d", "description": "The Liberals lose their majority; Scheer says the Conservatives have put Trudeau \u201con notice.\u201d", "authors": ["Amanda Coletta"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lKxC0swnjNR0IVqe7YsRsy3Xpgc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A6SYSQHUCMI6TLMLQXRKUAFVZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
