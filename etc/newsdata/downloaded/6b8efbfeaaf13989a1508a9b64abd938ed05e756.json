Net outflows since the referendum vote in June 2016 from funds which invest specifically in U.K. companies reached $29.8bn, according to data from EPFR.\n\nLucy Macdonald, chief investment officer for global equities at Allianz Global Investors, said in addition to uncertainty surrounding the Brexit outcome, the policy proposals of the opposition Labour Party under leader Jeremy Corbyn have also affected sentiment.\n\n\u201cAnother reason why global investors have been nervous about the U.K. has been the threat of an extreme left-wing government. Although that looks a lower risk because of where the polls are, it is still a risk,\u201d said Macdonald.\n\nAccording to poll tracker Britain Elects, the Conservatives have a nine-point lead, with 33% of voters intending to vote Tory against 24% for Labour in a future election.\n\nMacdonald added: \u201cUntil that particular risk is taken off the table through an election, I don\u2019t think global investors are going to be coming back en masse.\u201d\n\nAccording to figures published in October from Calastone, the funds data company, active equity funds domiciled in the U.K. had their worst three-month period on record between July and September, with investors pulling a net \u00a33.5bn worth of assets \u2014 more than the previous three quarters combined.\n\nFunds that invest specifically in U.K. companies were the hardest hit during the period, with investors taking out a net \u00a31.2bn as political uncertainty continues over Brexit. Real-estate funds sold to U.K. investors also had a record quarter for outflows, with a net \u00a3667m heading for the exit.\n\nPolitical uncertainty \u2014 in particularly the risk that a Labour government could nationalize key industries in the U. K. \u2014 has also spooked investors.\n\nAsset managers raised concerns about Labour proposals to hand workers in some U.K. companies shares worth more than \u00a3300bn \u2014 a move which fund managers warned could dilute their existing investments and lead to businesses fleeing the U.K.\n\nHowever, large investors have expressed doubts that Labour could win an election outright.\n\nAccording to a poll of 49 large investors, conducted at the end of September by opinion sharing forum Procensus, a Conservative majority was considered the most likely outcome of a general election, followed by a coalition between the Tories and Brexit Party.\n\nThe poll represented a shift in sentiment from July, when investors indicated the most likely outcome of a general election would be a Labour-led coalition.\n\nDespite some investor fears about a Corbyn-led government, emerging markets veteran Mark Mobius said the party\u2019s fiery rhetoric was unlikely to become a reality.\n\n\u201cOnce these people get into office you find they have to taper their rhetoric quite dramatically and any extreme \u2014 right or left \u2014 have to move to the center,\u201d said Mobius.\n\nHe added: \u201cThere is no way [Corbyn] will be able to implement radical policies because a coalition, or bureaucracy, just won\u2019t let it happen.\u201d\n\nAllianzGI\u2019s Macdonald added: \u201cSome of Labour\u2019s policies may be watered down, but you can\u2019t say ahead of an election.\u201d\n\nPascal Blanqu\u00e9, chief investment officer at Amundi, said some potential outcomes have still not been priced into the market, including a scenario involving a Brexit deal being struck and Corbyn winning an election.\n\nHe added: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve heard from Labour so far won\u2019t necessarily reassure financial markets.\u201d\n\nRead more from FN\u2019s Money Masters series, in which elite asset managers tackle 2019\u2019s toughest investing questions \u2014 from Brexit to Trump", "description": "Investment heavyweights warn investors will continue to shun the U.K. until such threats can be completely discounted", "authors": ["David Ricketts"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS282_boris__ZG_20190930063136.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
