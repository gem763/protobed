Rebekah Vardy quickly denied she was to blame.\n\nIn a Twitter post, Rooney wrote that she had suspected a follower of her personal Instagram account had been consistently informing The Sun of her private posts and stories.\n\nRooney, who has 1.3 million followers on Twitter, said she blocked everyone from viewing her Instagram stories except one person. She then posted a series of false stories to see whether they leaked out, which she said they had.\n\nShe wrote that only one person had viewed the false stories, and added: \u201cIt\u2019s...Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u201d\n\nDenying any responsibility for the leaks to The Sun, Vardy suggested others had accessed her account.\n\n\u201cI never speak to anyone about you (Rooney) as various journalists who have asked me to over the years can vouch for,\u201d Vardy wrote on Twitter.\n\nRooney\u2019s post was retweeted tens of thousands of times with more than 177,000 likes.\n\nThe Sun said each of the stories provided to the newspaper was put to Rooney\u2019s representatives before publication, and on each occasion they declined to comment. \u201cLike all reputable media organisations, we don\u2019t comment on sources,\u201d The Sun said.\n\nThe hashtag #WAGatha Christie, an amalgam of the late crime fiction writer Agatha Christie and the media\u2019s acronym for footballers\u2019 wives and girlfriends (WAG), was also trending.", "description": "A row between the wives of two top English soccer players has gone viral after one accused the other of leaking stories about her to a tabloid newspaper.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438920040&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981PF", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
