[YONHAP]\n\nThe chief nuclear negotiators of South Korea, the United States and Japan met in Washington Tuesday and reaffirmed the importance of working together to achieve complete denuclearization and lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, the U.S. State Department said.Lee Do-hoon, special representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs, held bilateral and trilateral talks with his U.S. and Japanese counterparts - Stephen Biegun and Shigeki Takizaki - to discuss last weekend\u2019s working-level denuclearization negotiations between North Korea and the United States in Sweden.At their meetings Tuesday, the three sides \u201creaffirmed the importance of continued close U.S.-ROK, U.S.-Japan, and trilateral coordination on North Korea to achieve complete denuclearization and bring lasting peace to the Korean Peninsula,\u201d the State Department said in a statement.ROK stands for South Korea\u2019s official name, the Republic of Korea.Lee spoke briefly to reporters as he left the meetings but refused to share details.\u201cWe spoke mostly about how to keep the momentum for dialogue [with North Korea],\u201d he said. \u201cSouth Korea and the United States are coordinating well and we will continue to do so.\u201dNorth Korea had demanded that the United States come to the table with a new proposal after their summit in Vietnam in February broke down over differences on how much the North should denuclearize before receiving sanctions relief from the U.S.Pyongyang has also stepped up calls for U.S. security guarantees for its regime.Lee, the South Korean envoy, became a target of North Korean criticism Tuesday.In an article published in the Choson Sinbo, a pro-North Korea newspaper based in Japan, the North denounced the South for trying to play a \u201cmediating role\u201d in denuclearization talks between Pyongyang and Washington and claimed that Seoul cannot do anything independently of Washington.\u201cIt is dumbfounding, as what role on earth the South is trying to play at a time when it can\u2019t do anything but just pay attention to what the United States says,\u201d the paper said.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un visited a military farm, state media reported Wednesday, in his first public appearance since the breakdown of working-level nuclear negotiations with the United States in Sweden last weekend.The \u201cfield guidance\u201d to Farm No. 1116 under Unit 810 of the Korean Peoples\u2019 Army appears to be designed to underline Kim\u2019s commitment to resolve food problems and focus on economic development despite the lack of progress in Saturday\u2019s talks with the United States in Stockholm.The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) did not say exactly when the farm visit was made, as is customary with North Korean state media, but such reporting usually comes a day after the visit. The visit also marked Kim\u2019s first public appearance in about four weeks.\u201cThe only thing we can rely on is the power of science and technology,\u201d Kim said during the visit, according to the KCNA, stressing the importance of training scientists and technicians and taking good care of them.\u201cHe called on all the units in every field to establish the viewpoint and work attitude of giving priority to science and technology to carry out their tasks with their own efforts as social customs, holding fast to science and technology,\u201d the KCNA said.Kim also \u201cunderscored the need for the agricultural scientific research sector to study farming methods for increased production in intermediate and mountainous areas and low-yielding areas and thus provide sci-tech guarantee for attaining the goal for grain production,\u201d it said.Yonhap", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/09193330.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
