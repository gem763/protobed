Despite this, she adds, \u201cI exercise confidential possession and control over it.\u201d\n\nLetsatsi-Duba faces three charges, writes Mkhwebane: \u201cinterfering with the functioning of the office of the Public Protector; obstructing and/or frustrating the Public Protector from executing her constitutional, sanctioned and lawful activities; and being in contempt of the Public Protector\u201d.\n\nGordhan was implicated in claims of the existence of a so-called rogue unit at the SA Revenue Service during his time as finance minister. Mkhwebane was probing this complaint, which relates to the violation of the Executive Members\u2019 Ethics Act.\n\nMkhwebane was probing this complaint, with relates to the violation of the Executive Members\u2019 Ethics Act, in connection with the granting of pension to Irvin Pillay and his subsequent rehiring.\n\nIn the police statement, Mkhwebane says she had been in possession of the leaked document by February 15 or earlier, after it was \u201canonymously dropped off\u201d at the Public Protector\u2019s office in Hatfield, Pretoria.\n\nMkhwebane\u2019s charges came just over a week after City Press reported that Letsatsi-Duba had pressed charges against the Public Protector for illegal possession of a classified state document \u2013 although Mkhwebane\u2019s affidavit was signed two days after the City Press story.\n\nRead: Spy boss charges Public Protector over classified report\n\nIn her affidavit, Mkhwebane says she voluntarily alerted Letsatsi-Duba during a meeting on February 15 that the leaked document \u2013 purporting to be the classified report on an investigation concluded by the office of the inspector-general of intelligence on October 31 2014 \u2013 was dropped off by unidentified sources.\n\n\u201cI must outrightly here state that at no stage during this meeting did the minister seek to view the document I had in my possession, purportedly the report I sought access to.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the meeting, the minister undertook to furnish her with a declassified report. But five days later, Mkhwebane writes, she was taken aback when Letsatsi-Duba wrote to her \u201cexpressing dissatisfaction about the access by myself to the report\u201d.\n\nMkhwebane goes on to say that Letsatsi-Duba \u201cadvised that I should employ several security measures relating to the handling of the report, whilst similarly threatening to lay criminal charges against me for being in illegal possession of the classified document\u201d.\n\nEighteen days later, Mkhwebane learnt from a City Press report that the minister had laid criminal charges against her for illegal possession of the classified report.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, the Public Protector subpoenaed Letsatsi-Duba on January 18 with two weeks\u2019 notice to comply, by the end of the month.\n\nBut the minister missed the deadline.\n\nInstead of the minister submitting the declassified report, the acting director-general of state security, Loyiso Jafta, requested an extension until February 6 to afford him \u201can opportunity to advise the minister\u201d.\n\nIn contrast, writes Mkhwebane, the inspector-general of intelligence, Setlhomamaru Dintwe, appeared before her on January 31 and \u201cindicated that he will consult the minister as the custodian of the report in terms of the Oversight Act, subsequent to which he will submit the document to my office\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is my respectful submission that the minister\u2019s failure to avail the declassified report, as subpoenaed, amounts to contempt of the Public Protector and also amounts to interference with the functioning of my office, and is therefore an offence,\u201d says Mkhwebane in her affidavit.", "description": "Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has told police she has a leaked copy of the spy report that State Security Minister Dipuo Letsatsi-Duba refused to officially hand over to her \u2013 but has cautioned that hers could be fake.", "authors": ["Setumo Stone"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8682/b58ea9865ff34e958aea3c6a5df2e569.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-01"}
