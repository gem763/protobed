I\u2019m going to f*****g kill you. I\u2019m going to f*****g knife you.\u201d\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\nThe fight allegedly began when Asan made goading remarks at Kym Marsh's ex husband.\n\nAsan has remained tight-lipped about the incident - until now.\n\nTaking to Twitter yesterday evening, he posted a contemplative message putting a positive spin on the events and implying he was going to stick at acting.\n\n\"All the people who\u2019ve reached out and had my back you\u2019ll never know how much I appreciate you\", he wrote.\n\n\"I\u2019ve learned, I\u2019ve grown and now I\u2019m working harder than ever to finish what I started. Keep you\u2019re circle tight and always fall forward! [sic]\"\n\nHe added: \"The universe tends to unfold as it should.\"\n\nThere were mixed responses to the tweet, as some followers stepped in to defend him, but some were repulsed by his threats to Jamie.\n\n\"So good to hear from you Asan. I was worried because it\u2019s like you disappeared. You are human, we all make mistakes. The Universe will open many doors for you,\" said a supportive fan.\n\n\"Hope everything works out for you, you will be missed on Emmerdale, should have been given another chance\", said another.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\n\"Everyone makes mistakes it's how you learn from it is that matters it's part of growing, you will be ok, bigger and better things for you, bit disappointed with Emmerdale for how they handled it but you will be fine x,\" wrote another well-wisher.\n\nBut another user disagreed, questioning: \"Disappointed with Emmerdale for how they handled it... Seriously?\"\n\n\"His behaviour was disgusting\", they added.\n\n\"I have no tolerance with people threatening others with knives - sorry I don\u2019t want you back on the tv - you had your chance and blew it\", claimed another.\n\n(Image: Ana M Wiggins / SplashNews.com)\n\nDespite his sacking, Asan still appeared in scenes on Emmerdale that he had already filmed as his character, Ellis Chapman.\n\nSoap bosses confirmed that Ellis will be staying on screen for another six weeks as it would be \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d to remove his character from the forthcoming storylines without cancelling episodes.\n\nEmmerdale viewers took to twitter after watching Ellis return to the village - and some were disappointed to see his scenes.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nOn viewer said: \"Ellis on tv..... tut tut Emmerdale... should of cut his scenes.\"\n\n\"Didn\u2019t think they were showing Ellis scenes,\" added another.\n\nA third said: \"It will be a good bye committee soon for ellis\".\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nA show source told the Mirror: \u201cAsan will still appear in the episodes he has recorded which will air for the next six weeks or so.\n\n\u201cThere have been some meetings to decide what to do and this seems the most sensible option. We regularly have to rewrite scenes due to cast sickness and so it is not as unusual as it sounds to be suddenly re-writing storylines.\n\n\u201cBy next week we will be filming scenes which will help write out Ellis and explain his absence from the show for good.\u201d", "description": "The disgraced actor was sacked after a public fight where he threatened to kill Jamie Lomas, and he has remained silent until now", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Wireimage", "Daily Mirror", "Ana M Wiggins", "Splashnews.Com", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19973114.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Celebrity-departures-at-TV-Choice-Awards-held-at-Hilton-Park-Lane-in-London.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
