Australian referee Nic Berry replied simply: \"Tackle lower.\"\n\nIt should be that simple, and to many it is. Others insist the new guidelines are impossible to apply in such a high-speed, contact sport and are littered with inconsistency.\n\nThe backdrop to the debate is the fact that thousands of rugby players of every level have and continue to suffer impact-related concussion, a brain injury with potentially devastating consequences, which only relatively recently are being understood.\n\nThe sport's governing body World Rugby (WR) set about trying to understand and improve the situation and long and extensive research revealed that the vast majority of concussions occur in the tackle.\n\nMore specifically, when the tackler is upright, hitting at or above the chest and arriving with force, there will be a far more likely outcome of concussion than otherwise.\n\nThe result is WR's high tackle framework, the step-process of decisions referees must consider when analyzing a potentially dangerous tackle and heard by TV viewers and fans in the stadium and via the referee's microphone as he consults the TV match official.\n\n\"Was it high? Was there impact to the head? Was there an attempt to wrap the arms? Was there force? Was there any mitigation (the tackled player ducking or the tackler slipping or being pushed)?\"\n\nAs seen over the last three weeks, often the eventual outcome is a red card. Previously there was an average of slightly over two red cards per World Cup but in Japan there have been seven already, and the knockout stage is yet to begin.\n\nIn previous decades the principle of the tackle was to stop a player's progress and bring him to the ground by what was always considered a traditional \"rugby tackle\". That has gradually been replaced by the concept of the \"hit\" - with rugby league-style defense battling to knock runners back and win the \"battle of the gainline\".\n\n\"The game is changing right in front of us,\" said Ian McGeechan, former center for Scotland and the British & Irish Lions and coach of both, after the Samoa v Ireland match. \"It has to be a leg tackle now - it's a re-education process.\"\n\nSome of the cards have been for direct contact with the head by a shoulder, typically in a no-arms tackle - something that should always have been a red card offense under the existing laws but which was rarely punished as such.\n\nOthers, more contentiously, have come after the tackler has made his initial impact around the shoulder or chest area, then slid up to make contact with the head.\n\n\"I don't know what a tackler is supposed to do if a player dips that low,\" said former Ireland captain Brian O'Driscoll of Lam's card, adding that players had only a split-second to react if the player to be tackled ducks down. \"The big shot is going to be ruled out of our game.\"\n\nHowever, those complaining about \"centimeters\" or \"milliseconds\" are missing WR's point. The governing body, who of course have a duty of care to every level of the game, are demanding a fundamental change of approach - so that a change of position might result in a different point of contact, but still not a dangerous one.\n\nAs the French referees on duty in Japan can be regularly heard advising players: \"Change your behavior\".\n\nDespite WR's best intentions, however, it is not a clear and easy path, even with those who are fully supportive.\n\nLast season an experimental law change outlawing tackles above the armpit in the cup competition of England's second-tier Championship was abandoned early when it was found it was actually increasing concussions - thought initially to be a result of players bending more at the waist ahead of contact.\n\nOther critics say that forcing players to tackle lower leaves the ball carrier free to offload.\n\nThat is probably true, but those with a close-up view of people suffering from the effects of tackle-induced brain damage would need convincing that more passes and potentially more exciting tries is a poor outcome in exchange for improvement in player safety.\n\nWorld Rugby chief Brett Gosper said Tuesday there would be no change to the hard line on high tackles and that the number of red cards would decrease once players changed their behavior.\n\n\"If there have been red cards shown, it's because there are big issues around player welfare due to foul play whether it's intentional or unintentional,\" Gosper told reporters.\n\n\"And we'll drive that hard line to protect the players and we'll see diminishing red cards because the behavior of players and coaches will change over time. We're willing to risk some outcomes or debates to ensure we police that properly. That's the direction of travel,\" he added.\n\nThe loss of a player to a red card can have a major impact on a team's chances of winning a match, particularly if it happens early on.\n\nGosper said that systems like that used in Australia's National Rugby League, where offending players are placed \"on report\" but remain on the pitch had been considered in various committees.\n\n\"The feeling is that it's right to punish the team despite the (imbalance) that might be created in the match at that time,\" he said.\n\n\"There are some unions have strong opinions on that both ways. The feeling is that this is one of the things that upholds the values of the game. And the team should take that punishment as well as the player.\n\n\"Certainly the red cards are there to protect the players and we think that behavior is changing and coaching is changing to adapt to that new reality,\" Gosper said.\n\nWorld Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont said he thought the referees had done a good job since the first weekend of the tournament, after which the governing body made a statement apologizing for the standard of officiating.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "A brief exchange in Samoa's game against Ireland perfectly encapsulated the internal struggle rugby is undergoing as officials seek to make the game safer in the face of some confusion and some blank refusal by those playing it.
