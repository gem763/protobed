The stealing of galaxies is part of this long, long process.\n\n\u2018The high number of tiny dwarf galaxies seems to suggest the dark matter content of the LMC is quite large, meaning the Milky Way is undergoing the most massive merger in its history, with the LMC, its partner, bringing in as much as one third of the mass in the Milky Way\u2019s dark matter halo \u2014 the halo of invisible material that surrounds our galaxy,\u2019 said Ethan Jahn, the first author of the paper and a graduate student in Sales\u2019 research group.", "description": "Cosmic kleptomaniac nicked a star system from a gigantic satellite galaxy called the Large Magellanic Cloud.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screenshot-2019-08-12-at-10.51.53-6f66_1570790545.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
