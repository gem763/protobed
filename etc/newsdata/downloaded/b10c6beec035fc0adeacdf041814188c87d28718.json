No doubt that the investors look cautious before interest decision by the Indian Central bank within next few minutes; where a cut of 25 basis points is expected; but the announcement of Service PMI (September) is also to accompany this, which may reflect the turn of investors to create the fresh position. I find that the currently prevailing exhaustion in Nifty 50 and may extend heavy selling during the day; as the global equity markets have their focus toward the key U.S. job report that could help determine whether the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates further.\n\nFinally, I conclude that the growing bearish pressure in and Nifty Auto may continue to extend more exhaustion in till weekly closing. I find that the growing bearishness in European and Japanese equity markets may also extend exhaustion in Nifty during the upcoming weeks.
