Hopefully, we can reach an agreement that will be beneficial for both countries,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAs I have made very clear, I will not accept a bad deal.\u201d\n\nTrump also recently said he was not interested in a \u201cpartial deal\u201d to ease tensions with China, saying that he would hold out for a \u201ccomplete deal.\u201d\n\nHARSH RHETORIC, STOCK FALL\n\nU.S. stocks gave up modest gains and fell into negative territory after Trump\u2019s U.N. address, which some investors said marked a reversal of the more constructive tone that had surrounded the negotiations last week. [.N]\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s comments to the U.N. were very antagonistic toward China. In the last couple of weeks there\u2019s been optimism trade would go in a positive direction,\u201d said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance, an investment advisory group based in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\n\u201cIt was the tone and the fact he listed out in great detail all the gripes the U.S. has with China,\u201d Zaccarelli said. \u201cAll that trade optimism that\u2019s been building has been sucked out of the air and replaced with pessimism.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s speech highlighted the plight of U.S. memory chip maker Micron Technology (MU.O), which has become a symbol of U.S. assertions that China fails to protect American intellectual property and steals it or forces the transfer of it. Two years ago Micron accused a Chinese state firm of stealing its chip designs.\n\n\u201cSoon, the Chinese company obtains patents for nearly an identical product, and Micron was banned from selling its own goods in China,\u201d Trump said, \u201cBut we are seeking justice.\u201d\n\nHe added that the United States lost 60,000 factories and 4.2 million manufacturing jobs since China joined the World Trade Organization.\n\n\u201cThe rhetoric around China and President Trump\u2019s speech was as harsh as we have heard,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at brokerage National Securities Corp in New York.\n\nChina\u2019s top official at the U.N. General Assembly, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, sat silently during Trump\u2019s remarks, showing no reaction on camera.\n\nWang is due to speak on U.S.-China relations on Tuesday evening at a business event in New York.\n\nCHINA SOY PURCHASES\n\nThe tone of Trump\u2019s speech also was at odds with some recent steps by China to meet his request for purchases of more American farm products. On Monday, Chinese importers bought about 10 shiploads of U.S. soybeans - about 600,000 tonnes.\n\nChina\u2019s customs commission will exclude certain amounts of U.S. soybeans, pork and other products from its retaliatory tariffs, the official Xinhua news agency said on Tuesday.\n\nThe purchases were made following last week\u2019s trade talks, which both the U.S. and Chinese sides characterized as \u201cproductive.\u201d People familiar with the trade talks said no new Chinese proposals were presented, and the countries agreed to continue minister-level talks in early October.\n\nIn his U.N. speech, Trump also drew a link between resolving the U.S.-China trade dispute and Beijing\u2019s treatment of Hong Kong. Washington was \u201ccarefully monitoring the situation in Hong Kong,\u201d he said.\u201dThe world fully expects that the Chinese government will honor its binding treaty made with the British and registered with the United Nations, in which China commits to protect Hong Kong\u2019s freedom, legal system and democratic ways of life,\u201d Trump said. Hong Kong was a British colony until 1997.\n\n\u201cHow China chooses to handle the situation will say a great deal about its role in the world in the future. We are all counting on President Xi as a great leader,\u201d Trump added.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump addresses the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly at U.N. headquarters in New York City, New York, U.S., September 24, 2019. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri\n\nTrump also touched on trade with Japan in his speech, saying that he and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Wednesday would \u201ccontinue our progress in finalizing a terrific new trade deal.\u201d\n\nIt remains unclear whether the two countries will sign the deal at their bilateral meeting or whether Japanese requests for assurances that Trump won\u2019t hit them with autos tariffs will delay the final agreement.\n\n(This story corrects typographical error in headline to make it \u201cTrump\u2019s China ...\u201d instead of \u201cTrumps\u2019 China ...\u201d)", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump delivered a stinging rebuke to China's trade practices on Tuesday at the United Nations General Assembly, saying he would not accept a \"bad deal\" in U.S.-China trade negotiations.", "authors": ["Jeff Mason", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433381588&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N1C2", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
