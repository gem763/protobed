(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nA man in Arkansas died after he was attacked by a buck he shot while hunting , wildlife officials said Thursday.\n\nThomas Alexander, 66, shot the animal with a muzzle loader near Yellville, Arkansas, in the Ozark Mountains Tuesday evening and got out of his deer stand to check on it, Keith Stephens, a spokesperson for the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, told USA TODAY.\n\n\"Evidently, it got up and attacked him and he was gored several times,\" Stephens said.\n\nAlexander was able to contact his wife, who then called emergency services, Stephens said. Emergency personnel requested an air evacuation, but the hunter stopped breathing and had to be taken to an area hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\n\nIt is unclear whether the man died of injuries sustained during the attack or from another medical condition, Stephens said, but no autopsy was expected to be performed. Wildlife officers have not yet found the deer that injured Alexander, but Stephens said they will continue to search the woods with dogs through the day.\n\nStephens said the accident is not an isolated incident. In 2016, another hunter was gored by a buck in Ashley County in southern Arkansas.\n\nWildlife officials recommend hunters wait at least 30 minutes before approaching an animal. Hunters should check for signs of breathing, approach cautiously from behind and avoid the hooves, which are particularly dangerous, Stephens said.\n\n\"They\u2019re extremely dangerous if you get them in a situation like that,\" he said. \"They\u2019re wired to survive and they\u2019re going to try to defend themselves if they can.\"\n\nFollow N'dea Yancey-Bragg on Twitter: @NdeaYanceyBragg\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/24/hunter-dies-after-deer-he-shot-gets-up-and-attacks-him-officials-say/4084598002/", "description": "A hunter in Arkansas died Thursday after a deer he shot got back up and attacked him, wildlife officials say.", "authors": ["N'Dea Yancey-Bragg", "Published P.M.
