Paleo-like diets are said to boost canine vitality and immunity, even if there is scant research to back up such claims.\n\nIndeed, veterinary medical associations in the United States and Canada have raised concerns about raw meat pet food, with reports showing it to be a source of Salmonella and infectious yersiniosis in dogs.\n\nAnd that, Nuesch-Inderbinen told AFP, is a problem for humans.\n\n\"Raw meat-based diets may be contaminated with bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics, including those categorised by the World Health Organization (WHO) as critically important for human medicine,\" she wrote by email.\n\n- Pet lover beware -\n\n\"There is growing evidence that these pathogens pose a risk of infectious disease to humans not only during handling of feed, but also through the contamination of household surfaces and through close contact to the dogs and their feces.\"\n\nThere are an estimated 140 million dogs and cats in the European Union, and at least as many in North America.\n\nMore generally, antibiotic resistance has became a major health crisis across the globe.\n\n\"The situation with multi-drug resistant bacteria has spiralled out of control in recent years,\" said co-author Roger Stephan, a professor at the University of Zurich's Institue for Food Safety and Hygiene.\n\nThe indiscriminate and sometimes inappropriate use of antibiotics have allowed surviving bugs to mutate into superbugs that outpace the development of new medicines.\n\nBecause of the overuse of antibiotics in the livestock production, animals raised for consumption have become a major reservoir for antimicrobial resistance.\n\n\"Like conventional pet food, most raw meat-based diets are based on the by-products of animals slaughtered for human consumption,\" the study notes.\n\nTo find out exactly how contaminated raw pet foods really are, the researchers tested 51 samples from different suppliers in Switzerland, purchased in stores and on the Internet.\n\n\"We advise all dog and cat owners who want to feed their pets a 'BARF' diet to handle the food carefully and maintain strict hygiene standards,\" said Nuesch-Inderbinen.\n\n\"Pet owners should be aware of the risk that their pet may be carrying multi-drug resistant bacteria and can spread them.\"", "description": "Increasingly popular raw meat meals for dogs and cats may be full of multi-drug resistant bacteria, posing a serious risk to animals and humans, scientists reported Wednesday.
