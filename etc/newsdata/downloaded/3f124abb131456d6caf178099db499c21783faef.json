President Trump and Leader McConnell are to be commended for turning the tide against unprecedented Democrat obstruction. With the President\u2019s latest announcement last week of new judicial nominations, the administration has designated nominees for all eight current vacancies on the U.S. courts of appeals. Tomorrow, the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing for two circuit court nominees\u2014Danielle Hunsaker for the Ninth Circuit and William Nardini for the Second Circuit\u2014along with three district court nominees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo additional circuit court nominees, Halil Ozerden for the Fifth Circuit and Steven Menashi for the Second Circuit, are among 11 judicial nominees on the agenda for the Committee\u2019s markup this Thursday.
