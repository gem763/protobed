My contract expires in December, and I don\u2019t know what will happen after that.\u201d\n\nIt all means that Ibrahimovic is potentially only one defeat away from the end of his career with the Galaxy as the MLS postseason kicks off this weekend.\n\nA win for the Galaxy at Minnesota on Sunday would set up a blockbuster Western Conference semi-final against Los Angeles FC next Thursday. History suggests that Galaxy should have enough to advance past Minnesota.\n\nIn six previous meetings with the team known as The Loons, the Galaxy have never lost, a record that encompasses four victories.\n\nGalaxy coach Guillermo Barros Schelotto sounded a note of caution however, pinpointing Minnesota\u2019s Colombian forward Darwin Quintero as the potential danger man.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very talented,\u201d Schelotto said. \u201cHe can make a goal where you think, \u2018What happened?\u2019 He can do that because he\u2019s very talented, he can do things with the ball that other people can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Rooney swansong \u2013\n\nWhile Ibrahimovic has so far declined to specify his future plans, there is no such uncertainty surrounding former Manchester United team-mate Wayne Rooney.\n\nRooney, who has made a similar impact in MLS since signing for D.C. United last year, will pack his bags and return to Britain after this season to take up a new role with Championship side Derby County.\n\nFirst, however, the former England captain is hoping to lead D.C. United deep into the playoffs. United\u2019s postseason starts with a challenging away tie in Toronto on Saturday, with a possible semi-final against New York City FC awaiting the winner next Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWhen I first joined here, I wanted to win a trophy,\u201d said Rooney, who has amassed 23 goals in 48 regular-season appearances since arriving in MLS. \u201cObviously, leaving a bit earlier than we all thought, this is my last opportunity. That\u2019s my goal before I go.\u201d\n\nD.C. United manager Ben Olsen credits Rooney with helping to set the club back on the road to success, saying he had \u201creally pushed this club forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a big plus for this club,\u201d Olsen said. Working with him, it\u2019s been a really good relationship.\n\n\u201cOn the field, I think he\u2019s helped us in a big way. Off the field, I think he\u2019s pushed me. I think he\u2019s made me a better coach, a better manager. And I think he\u2019s been a very good teammate and a good ambassador to the club.\u201d", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 Zlatan Ibrahimovic makes his Major League Soccer postseason debut on Sunday with Los Angeles Galaxy fans wondering if the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/08426f_zlatan-ibrahimovic-is-preparing-los-angeles-galaxy-mls-playoffs-speculation-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
