Some argue he was kidding \u2013 an absurd claim, under the circumstances \u2013 while a few in the GOP have been willing to make their dissatisfaction known. Most in the party have been content to hide and say nothing.\n\nBut House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) blazed his own trail, making an argument no one else has been willing to make. TPM reported:\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) made a befuddling claim on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d Monday morning, arguing that President Trump actually didn\u2019t tell China to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden on live-television. [\u2026] During an interview on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d McCarthy was asked about the emerging talking point among Republicans \u2014 that Trump was clearly just joking or trolling China when he asked the country to probe his political opponent. McCarthy not only didn\u2019t respond to whether the move was just a joke, he argued that Trump\u2019s \u201cnot saying China should investigate.\u201d \u201cYou watch what the President said, he\u2019s not saying China should investigate,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nThere are some elements of any political scandal that involve judgment calls and matters of subjectivity, but this isn\u2019t one of them. Four days ago, Donald Trump stood on the White House South Lawn, appeared in front of a significant group of journalists, and said, \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens.\u201d\n\nI suppose it\u2019s possible some very creative person in the House GOP leadership might make the case that there\u2019s an ever-so-subtle difference between \u201cChina should investigate\u201d and \u201cChina should start an investigation,\u201d but I\u2019m comfortable concluding that no fair-minded observer would ever take such an argument seriously.\n\nWhat we\u2019re left with is an example of Kevin McCarthy, desperate to shield Trump from accountability, failing to familiarize himself with the most basic elements of a scandal \u2013 for the second time in eight days.\n\nAs regular readers know, the House Republican leader appeared on 60 Minutes last weekend to defend the president against the Ukraine scandal, but McCarthy appeared lost when Scott Pelley presented him with basic factual information.\n\nPELLEY: What do you make of this exchange? President Zelensky says, \u201cWe are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.\u201d And President Trump replies, \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though.\u201d MCCARTHY: You just added another word. PELLEY: No, it\u2019s in the transcript. MCCARTHY: He said- \u201cI\u2019d like you to do a favor though\u201d? PELLEY: Yes, it\u2019s in the White House transcript.\n\nAt the bottom of page two of the call summary, released by the White House, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is quoted talking about how eager his country is to receive additional military support from the United States. The very next words out of the American president\u2019s mouth, according to the document, are, \u201cI would like you to do us a favor, though.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy knew he was going on 60 Minutes. He knew the topic of the interview. He and his staff had time to prepare for basic questions about obvious details \u2013 such as the single most controversial phrase in the rough transcript that created a political earthquake the moment it was released. It was only 10 words; it stands to reason McCarthy would have familiarized himself with the quote before his national television appearance. But he didn\u2019t.\n\nA week later, the GOP leader went on Fox News. He again knew the topic of the interview, He and his staff again had time to prepare for basic questions about obvious details \u2013 such as the single most controversial phrase in a Q&A that created a political earthquake the moment it was uttered. It was only eight words; it stands to reason McCarthy would have familiarized himself with the quote before his national television appearance. But once again, he didn\u2019t.\n\nHouse Republicans don\u2019t appear to be sending us their best.", "description": "For the second time in eight days, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy struggled with reality while trying to defend Trump.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/04969229_0.jpg?itok=eZO4F1rl", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
