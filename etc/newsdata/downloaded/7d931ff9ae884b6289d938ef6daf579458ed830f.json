Guinness World Record adjudicators did not attend but the global community of BASE jumpers has accepted it as a record\n\nShe said that they had not registered the jump with the Guinness World Record adjudicators as they did not want to pay the fee.\n\nBut added that the global community of BASE jumpers had apparently accepted it as a record and had already started to pass on their congratulations.\n\nMs Poletyko added: 'We are delighted and proud that it all worked out so well and we were able to perform this stunt.\n\n'It was particularly great that there were so many international participants who took part and entrusted their lives to our organisers.'\n\nJohnny Utah Winkelkotter, who was a member of the group from America, posted proudly about the feat on his social media channels.\n\nMr Winkelkotter had previously notched up numerous world records for multiple BASE jumps such as a 49-way Cliff Jump at Eikesdalen in Norway in 2009.\n\nHe was joined by fellow American Katie Dainson who is an emergency helicopter rescue pilot in New York.\n\nDuring the four days of the festival there were a total of more than 800 jumps completed from the Skybridge, according to local media reports.\n\nThe Skybridge is part of the Skypark AJ Hackett Sochi-adventure Park in the Olympic city.", "description": "The footage was recorded by an onlooker standing below the Skybridge in Sochi, Russia, during the International BASE Jumping Festival.
