Then he got burned by Ukraine.", "language": "en", "text": "Pompeo defended the substance of the conversation but sidestepped the key concern: that Trump demanded Ukraine investigate one of his 2020 political rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe call \u201cwas about helping the Ukrainians to get graft out and corruption outside of their government,\u201d Pompeo said while in Rome. \u201cIt\u2019s what the State Department officials that I\u2019ve had the privilege to lead have been engaged in, and it\u2019s what we will continue to do, even while all this noise is going on.\u201d\n\nPompeo\u2019s handling of the Ukraine controversy is made more complicated by the role of Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, who has repeatedly insisted that the State Department, including the secretary, was aware of his activities and even had requested them.\n\nAway from the cameras, Pompeo has gone beyond casual dismissals of the \u201cnoise.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, he sent a letter to House committees slamming their effort to obtain testimonies from State Department officials linked to the Ukraine controversy. Pompeo even published the letter on his Twitter feed.\n\nHe couched his letter as a defense of civil and foreign service officers who work for the State Department, accusing lawmakers of trying to bully them into fast depositions. But lawmakers, as well as many U.S. diplomats, saw it another way: as Pompeo trying to scare his staff into silence.\n\nThree Democratic House committee chairmen on Tuesday took the unusual step of sending a response not to Pompeo, but to his deputy, John Sullivan.\n\nThey warned that his boss could face criminal penalties if he tried to impede the impeachment investigation. They also wrote that because Pompeo listened in on the July 25 call, he has a conflict of interest and could be \u201ca fact witness in the impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, went further, demanding that Pompeo recuse himself from all Ukraine-related matters, including those affecting the impeachment inquiry, as well as regular foreign policy.\n\n\u201cThe American people need to have confidence that the nation\u2019s chief diplomat is making decisions based on the national interest \u2014 not to advance a partisan political agenda,\u201d Menendez wrote. \u201cRecusal is the only option at this point to prevent further erosion of the integrity of U.S. foreign policy.\u201d\n\nLater Wednesday, Menendez questioned whether Pompeo may have spread misinformation within the State Department about his own employees who have been caught up in the impeachment inquiry. Menendez\u2019s comments came after the department\u2019s inspector general, in a hastily scheduled briefing, gave Congress documents tarring those employees that had come into his possession.\n\nThe State Department did not respond to requests for comment, but Trump on Wednesday defended his top diplomat. The president described Pompeo as \u201cthe most honorable person,\u201d and said that Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), one of the lead investigators in the impeachment inquiry, wasn\u2019t fit to carry Pompeo\u2019s \u201cblank strap.\u201d\n\nOther people who know Pompeo or have been tracking his career expressed a sense of astonishment \u2014 and schadenfreude \u2014 at how quickly his situation has changed.\n\nJust over three weeks ago, Pompeo could barely contain his glee as news came down that Trump was booting Bolton, a fierce internal rival who clashed with the secretary as they sought to win the president\u2019s ear.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo is at the center of the Ukraine-related impeachment storm consuming President Donald Trump. | Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nThe two men shared many hawkish views, but approached their boss in sharply different ways. Bolton made it known in public and private that he vigorously opposed Trump\u2019s talks with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, as well as his overtures to Iran and the Taliban. Pompeo is willing to disagree in private with Trump, but publicly shows no daylight. He also avoids criticizing the president when just with his staff, according to people who know him.\n\nBolton\u2019s departure suddenly gave Pompeo singular influence on foreign policy. Trump briefly considered naming Pompeo national security adviser on top of secretary of State. The president ultimately named a top Pompeo aide, hostage negotiator Robert O\u2019Brien, to lead the National Security Council \u2014 a decision likely to enhance Pompeo\u2019s influence, at least in the short term.\n\nHe has also benefited from a vacuum across the river at the Pentagon: For months following the resignation of Jim Mattis, who had reportedly stymied some of the president\u2019s more aggressive orders, the administration had no permanent Defense secretary. Only recently did the Senate confirm the low-profile former Army Secretary Mark Esper, who was a classmate of Pompeo\u2019s at West Point.\n\nPompeo\u2019s troubles on Capitol Hill come after a summer in which the secretary repeatedly and coyly stoked media interest in his future political ambitions, meeting with major Republican donors and influential conservative groups, booking speeches in Kansas and on local radio stations, and joking privately about his presidential aspirations.\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell has been openly urging Pompeo to run for the Senate seat vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Pat Roberts, fearing that immigration hard-liner and Trump favorite Kris Kobach will alienate swing voters.\n\nThere's no sign that the Ukraine scandal has damaged Pompeo's standing among Republicans. Flaunting one\u2019s closeness to Trump remains a winning strategy in most GOP primaries, but Pompeo\u2019s embrace of an unpopular president could become a talking point for a future Democratic opponent.\n\n\u201cPrecisely because he is close to Trump is why he\u2019s in trouble,\u201d said Thomas Wright, a foreign policy analyst at the Brookings Institution. \u201cHe will compromise his beliefs and principles to remain close to Trump. It\u2019s politically advantageous, but it\u2019s also very risky.\u201d\n\nMany of Pompeo\u2019s critics say he\u2019s experiencing karmic justice.\n\nWhen he was a Republican congressman from Kansas, he relentlessly hounded the Obama administration and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over the terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans.\n\nAt the time, Pompeo accused the Obama administration of obstructing congressional efforts to find out what truly happened in Benghazi. Now, Democrats point to his Benghazi-obsessed past to argue that he\u2019s the one obstructing a congressional inquiry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true he\u2019s getting his comeuppance, but I don\u2019t want to create an equivalence,\u201d said Jeffrey Prescott, a former national security aide in the Obama administration. \u201cThere is a crucial difference with Benghazi, which is that Pompeo\u2019s conduct goes to the heart of a clear abuse of power by the president and those around him.\u201d\n\nPompeo is known to be very intense in private during times of stress, even yelling at staffers. His outward demeanor can be prickly, too \u2014 he often chides reporters for questions he doesn\u2019t like.\n\nPompeo\u2019s allies explain his approach to Trump as the product of his military training. As a West Point graduate, he has an Army sensibility, seeing the president as the commander in chief whose decisions ultimately must be obeyed. \u201cHe\u2019ll say, \u2018He\u2019s the one who won the office, not me,\u2019\u201d a person who has worked with Pompeo said.\n\nThe person added, however: \u201cHe\u2019s far more shrewd than people give him credit for. He\u2019s smart, but also shrewd. He has an excellent memory. You tell him something once and he\u2019s like, \u2018Yep, got it, got it.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump has praised Pompeo\u2019s credentials \u2014 he noted on Wednesday, for instance, that his secretary of State graduated from Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of the law review.\n\nPompeo\u2019s reputed intelligence is one reason why lawmakers have a difficult time believing he didn\u2019t realize how disturbing the contents of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky would be, and why they are unlikely to stop demanding answers from him anytime soon.\n\nHis reputation in Foggy Bottom is probably the worst it\u2019s been since he left his post as CIA director to take over the State Department in April 2018.\n\nPompeo replaced Rex Tillerson, who was widely reviled in Foggy Bottom over his unwillingness to consult with department experts, among other complaints. Pompeo took several steps to ease the anger at State, including lifting a hiring freeze and promising to give U.S. diplomats what he called \u201cswagger.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Playbook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what\u2019s driving the afternoon in Washington.

For one thing, he abruptly withdrew early the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, a veteran foreign service officer.\n\nYovanovitch had been under attack by conservative figures over specious allegations that she\u2019d tried to block prosecutors and had expressed anti-Trump bias. Trump called her \u201cbad news\u201d in the July 25 call.\n\nPompeo might have been trying to protect her by pulling her out of Kyiv, but he\u2019s never publicly defended her, and her case has infuriated the diplomatic community. Now, Yovanovitch is one of the State Department officials House investigators want to depose; her session is scheduled for Oct. 11.\n\nPompeo appears well aware of the backlash. In an interview with Sky TG24 while he was in Italy, he offered a softer tone when asked about whether he was trying to bully U.S. diplomats.\n\n\u201cWe have, at the State Department, a very clear obligation to try and cooperate with our parliamentary, our congressional colleagues,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cI will do that. The State Department will do that.\"\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/37/05/3d8d8f40459c8d4b0ce3a02acac7/191003-trump-pompeo-gty-773.jpg"}
