Ephemeral growth spurts and financial volatility have been the predictable results.\u201d\n\nGlobal growth will fall from 3% in 2018 to 2.3% this year \u2013 its weakest since the 1.7% contraction in 2009, according to the report. Several big emerging countries were already in recession and some advanced economies, including Germany and the UK, were dangerously close to one.\n\nCentral banks , including the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have recently announced interest cuts in an attempt to stimulate activity but the UN report was pessimistic about the chances of success.\n\n\u201cThe slowdown in growth in all the major developed economies, including the US, confirms that relying on easy monetary policy and asset price rises to stimulate demand produces, at best, ephemeral growth, while tax cuts for corporations and wealthy individuals fail to trigger productive investment.\u201d\n\nUnconventional monetary measures \u2013 such as negative interest rates and creating money through quantitative easing \u2013 remained the go-to policies for addressing weaknesses in the global economy even though they have had a weak record since the financial crisis.\n\nTrade growth was expected to slow sharply this year as a result of a slump in global demand and the protectionist measures announced by Donald Trump.\n\nThe UN stressed the need to look beyond the short-term threat of recession to deeper and long-running threats.\n\n\u201cBeyond the immediate risks that could stall the global economy are a series of macrostructural challenges that predate the global financial crisis and have gone largely unattended since then,\u201d the report said.\n\nIt added that four issues stood out due to their high degree of interdependence: the smaller share of the economy\u2019s proceeds going to labour; the erosion of public spending; the weakening of investment; and the unsustainable increases in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\n\nIt continued: \u201cClimate protection requires a massive new wave of investment, reinventing energy and other carbon-emitting sectors. New low-carbon technologies must be created, installed and maintained on a global scale.\u201d\n\nThe report also highlighted increased green investment, which it said would be a significant source of income and jobs. \u201cRecent discussions call this strategy the Green New Deal, recalling the 1930s New Deal, which tackled unemployment and low wages, the predatory nature of finance, infrastructure gaps and regional inequalities, in the context of recovering from the Great Depression.\u201d", "description": "Report calls on policymakers to ward off threat by refocusing on jobs, wages and investment", "authors": ["Larry Elliott"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d6b4cb7c8b5834d85079aea939a2c7ef80fa5df/0_109_3380_2029/master/3380.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d6215a40970e9b7e6a364d1ee2b509b7", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
