The victim felt this was a threat to her life.'\n\nThe court heard Mrs Jeffers had requested a restraining order keeping her soon-to-be ex-husband out of her home in Blundellsands and out of the city centre coffee shop Lucy in the Sky, which she owns.\n\nThe footballer, 38, (right, playing for Everton in 1999) who now works as a youth coach for Everton FC, lost his temper after seeing his ex-partner of 20 years, Lucy Jeffers (the couple pictured on their wedding day, left) in the company of another man\n\nJeremy Hawthorn, defending Jeffers, said his client and Mrs Jeffers were in the process of agreeing a divorce in the civil courts and had been getting along well before the incident.\n\nHe told the court: 'He is a man of hitherto good character. He has a sporting career as his main achievement and he passes on that experience to the next generation as a full-time coach.'\n\nMr Hawthorn said the couple were expecting a decree absolute on November 22.\n\nHe said: 'At the end of May there was a bit of a breakdown. On one evening he sees her in the company of another man, and tempers that had probably been bubbling away and would have come to a head, erupt and he sends those messages that he regrets.'\n\nSpeaking also prohibited Jeffers from contacting his wife by any means, and from entering the grounds of her home and her coffee shop, under the terms of a 12-month restraining order.\n\nMr Hawthorn said Jeffers was invited for a voluntary interview by Merseyside Police and admitted the offence, telling officers he regretted his actions.\n\nHe said there had been no further issues between the pair since the offence and the divorce was progressing via their solicitors.\n\nChair of the magistrates' bench, Peter Fisher, said: 'You have pleaded guilty and not prevaricated with the court.\n\n'As Mr Hawthorn has told us, this is something you seemed to show remorse and regret about and it is hopefully something you can put behind you in the future.'\n\nMr Fisher said the offence fell into Category 3 of the sentencing guidelines and was therefore punishable by a fine.\n\nHe also prohibited Jeffers from contacting his wife by any means, and from entering the grounds of her home and her coffee shop, under the terms of a 12-month restraining order.\n\nJeffers was fined \u00a3625 and ordered to pay \u00a385 court costs and a \u00a362 victim surcharge.\n\nAs a youth at Everton, Jeffers was tipped for a bright future and caught the eye of Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, who brought the starlet to Highbury in 2001.\n\nHowever, he failed to live up to his potential after the \u00a310m move and was loaned back to Everton in 2003, followed by spells at a series of clubs including Charlton, Blackburn, Rangers and Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nHe also had a spell in the Australian leagues playing for Newcastle Jets before returning to Merseyside.\n\nIn a 2017 interview with the Telegraph, Jeffers said if he had his time again he would never have left Everton for Arsenal.\n\nHe told a reporter: 'I didn't fulfil my potential. That is a fact.\n\n'I don't have to hide that. I should not have ended up with just one England cap, but for one reason or another* it is all different things.\n\n'Myself, a bit of luck, wrong move at the wrong time, injuries. You can go on. But you know what? I still played for England. If you asked me about that when I was ten*\n\n'It was never going to get any better for me than playing for Everton. I was on the terraces so that was as good as it got. But I'm not blowing smoke up my backside by saying I know I should have done better.'", "description": "The footballer, 38, who now works as a youth coach for Everton FC, lost his temper\u00a0after seeing his ex-partner of 20 years, Lucy Jeffers, in the company of\u00a0another man.", "authors": ["Ed Riley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/15/20382112-0-image-a-28_1572449238527.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
