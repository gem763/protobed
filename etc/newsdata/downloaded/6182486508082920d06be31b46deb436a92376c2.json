This would match the rate cut announced by the Fed on July 31, its first since 2008.\n\nBut economists at Renaissance Macro on Wednesday outlined the simple, three-part case for why the Fed should be more aggressive this month and cut interest rates by 0.50%.\n\n\u201cAt Jackson Hole, [Fed chair Jay] Powell noted three factors weighing on the outlook: global growth, trade policy uncertainty, and muted inflation,\u201d the firm tweeted on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cAll of these factors have moved in an unfavorable direction.\u201d\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a dinner hosted by the Bank of France in Paris, Tuesday, July 16, 2019. (AP Photo/Michel Euler) More\n\nWednesday\u2019s tweetstorm expands on a research note published by Renaissance\u2019s head of economics Neil Dutta on Tuesday that detailed how each of these factors gives Powell cover for an aggressive \u2014 and surprising \u2014 cut in two weeks.\n\n\u201cIn August, just 39% of global manufacturing PMIs [were] in expansion territory,\u201d Dutta wrote. \u201cWhile this mark is better than July, it represents the third consecutive month of net PMI contraction.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s reading on U.S. manufacturing activity in August indicated contracting activity for the first time in three years. And while Yahoo Finance\u2019s Sam Ro notes that this reading doesn\u2019t indicate an imminent recession \u2014 as manufacturing accounts for just 12% of GDP, 15% of capex, and less than 9% of payrolls \u2014 this data does contribute to the case for Powell to surprise markets.\n\nDutta also noted Tuesday that continued uncertainty around U.S.-China trade policy \u2014 for instance, reports over the weekend indicated the two sides can\u2019t even find a time to meet \u2014 is weighing on the outlook. Consumer sentiment data released last week showed \u201cthe erosion of consumer confidence due to tariff policies is now well underway,\u201d while companies including Best Buy (BBY) and Foot Locker (FL) have pointed to the trade war as a negative for consumers during their most recent earnings calls.\n\nSign up!

More\n\nAnd while former New York Fed president Bill Dudley was perhaps inelegant in outlining how the Fed ought to deal with the U.S.-China trade war in setting policy, his point that the Fed should, \u201cbe more explicit that the greatest risk to the economy was the uncertainty created by the U.S. trade war with China\u201d is becoming a consensus view.\n\nThe third pillar of Dutta\u2019s case for a 50 basis point cut in two weeks is the only part that is explicitly in the Fed\u2019s dual mandate \u2014 inflation. As of July, core PCE \u2014 the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure \u2014 stood at 1.6%, well below the Fed\u2019s 2% target, and Dutta notes that the strength of the dollar will continue to weigh on inflation expectations. This, in his view, likely puts the Fed\u2019s 2020 outlook for 1.9% core PCE in doubt.\n\nRates markets are currently pricing in a roughly 20% chance of a 50 basis point cut from the Fed on September 18. Ahead of prior Fed rate increases or cuts during this cycle, markets have almost fully-priced in the move beforehand.\n\nThis indicates that Powell still maintains an element of surprise, potentially making a 50 basis point cut in two weeks more potent than it would otherwise be if the market were to price in this move ahead of the meeting.\n\nLast week on The Final Round, Jim Bianco told Yahoo Finance that the bond market is signaling the Fed it needs to be more aggressive in cutting rates. In August, Bianco argued for a 50 basis point cut ahead of Powell\u2019s Jackson Hole speech.", "description": "Recent economic data has indicated the case for the Federal Reserve being more aggressive with its rate cut this month is getting stronger.", "authors": ["Myles Udland", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ToDgA1bwhB0zTKKlt7DAcw--~B/aD0xMDM3O3c9MTUwODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/c40f5e50-cf22-11e9-bf8d-0cdba27f7732", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
