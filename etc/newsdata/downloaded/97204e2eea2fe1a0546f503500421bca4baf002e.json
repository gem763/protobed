James McGovern, the chairman of the House Rules Committee who announced his panel would take up an impeachment procedure resolution on Wednesday to \u201censure transparency and provide a clear path forward.\u201d\n\nNunes, Jordan and McCaul accused McGovern, D-Mass., of not giving enough time for Republican members to review the resolution ahead of the vote and continued to blast the inquiry as a whole.\n\nPELOSI ANNOUNCES RESOLUTION ON IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS\n\n\u201cUnder House Rules you championed at the beginning of this Congress, major legislation is required to be posted 72 hours in advance of a vote,\u201d they wrote. \u201cYet, here, on the gravest and most solemn work the House can do, you are forcing the House to consider a resolution with text that is still not available two days before the vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout text, we know nothing about the Democrats\u2019 intended impeachment process. Your website describes the resolution as \u2018directing certain committees to continue their ongoing investigation,\u2019\u201d they continued. \u201cChairman Schiff does not need a resolution to continue leaking selective facts from his basement bunker.\u201d\n\nThey added: \u201cWe can only assume, therefore, that this resolution is necessary to allow Democrats to subvert the ordinary legislative process.\u201d\n\nThe fiery statement from them and other Republicans indicates the looming vote will not ease their concerns about the process being used to investigate Trump over allegations he improperly sought a politically related investigation from Ukraine and may have used U.S. military aid as leverage \u2014 which the president denies.\n\nRepublicans have for weeks complained about closed-door interviews being conducted as part of the probe and the lack of a formal House vote, challenging the legitimacy of the current framework for impeachment proceedings in the absence of one.\n\nMcGovern and Pelosi, D-Calif., announced Monday that the House would indeed vote on a resolution to formalize and establish the parameters of the Trump impeachment inquiry. Pelosi made clear that the vote is being conducted because of the Republican complaints.\n\n\u201cWe are taking this step to eliminate any doubt as to whether the Trump administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas, or continue obstructing the House of Representatives,\u201d Pelosi said Monday.\n\nShe accused Trump and his GOP allies of holding the position that \"because the House has not taken a vote, they may simply pretend the impeachment inquiry does not exist.\"\n\nThe resolution is not an actual article of impeachment, but rather a measure that sets process ground rules.\n\nBut in their letter Tuesday, the ranking members went on to allege the resolution \u201cwill allow the Committees to \u2018side step traditional time limits\u2019 and allow unelected congressional staff additional time during public hearings to question witnesses.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Democrats\u2019 entire impeachment process is fundamentally unfair,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIt is rigged. The American people see through this partisan charade.\u201d\n\nThey added: \u201cNo matter how hard you try to legitimize this sham impeachment inquiry, it cannot hide the Democrats\u2019 goal of relitigating the results of the 2016 presidential election.\u201d\n\nPelosi announced the Trump impeachment inquiry on Sept. 24, saying at the time that \"the president must be held accountable\" for his \"betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and the betrayal of the integrity of our elections.\"\n\nThe inquiry was opened after a whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump, during a July phone call, pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter as military aid to the country was being withheld.\n\nFox News' Alex Pappas contributed to this report.", "description": "The top Republicans on the House committees leading the impeachment inquiry into President Trump blasted the investigation as \u201cillegitimate\u201d and a\u00a0\u201csham\u201d on Tuesday even after Democrats scheduled a vote to formalize the proceedings -- signaling Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to hold that vote will not assuage the GOP's process complaints.", "authors": ["Brooke Singman", "Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News.
