That may depend on whether the Cowboys and his agent can finalize a new contract today.\n\nAppearing this morning on PFT Live, Charles Robinson of Yahoo Sports explained that the Cowboys hoped to get a deal done on Sunday to ensure that he\u2019d be available for the full week of preparation in advance of the Week One game against the Giants. Elliott\u2019s camp likely sensed the urgency; they waited through most of the day to respond to the Cowboys\u2019 latest offer, contributing to the frustration the organization felt when Elliott\u2019s response showed less movement than the team would have liked.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe problem at this point, as Robinson explained it, isn\u2019t the dollars but the structure. And that\u2019s one of the problems, from the team\u2019s perspective, with the deal given last year by the Rams to running back Todd Gurley.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to beat Gurley\u2019s new-money average of $14.375 million. It\u2019s quite another to match the terms regarding the vesting of guarantees.\n\nGurley\u2019s deal had full guarantees at signing to cover the first two years. After the first season, and within eight months after signing, the third year became fully guaranteed. After the second season, part of the fourth year becomes fully guaranteed. Also, much of the guarantees paid to Gurley have no offset language.\n\nElliott will have an easier time getting a higher APY in new money than he will getting the same structure, especially in light of the condition of Gurley\u2019s knee only one year removed from signing the new contract. The Rams definitely would not do that deal all over again; the Cowboys want to avoid the same situation.\n\nStory continues\n\nThey thought they would. They thought Elliott wouldn\u2019t clamor for a new contract until next year. Now, as the Cowboys close in on paying Elliott the money he wants, the real question is whether they\u2019ll give him the structure he needs.\n\nIf it doesn\u2019t happen in the next 24 hours, it will be hard to envision Elliott being ready to play by Sunday.", "description": "Will Ezekiel Elliott play in six days?
