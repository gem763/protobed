It currently operates in 5 countries with over 6,000 restaurants in their platform.\n\nIts proprietary platform mEngage helps restaurants with a single view of customers across ordering, reservations, feedback, payments, social media, website and marketing channels.\n\nBansal said Mobikon\u2019s proposed geographical expansion into Australia and South East Asia will give them unbeatable market leadership in the restaurant-tech segment.\n\nIn 2017, it raised $7 million (around Rs 44.7 crore then) in its Series B funding round from Sistema Asia Fund, C31 Ventures and Qualgro.\n\nIt raised an undisclosed amount in seed funding in 2012 and Series A funding of $5 million from Jungle Ventures, Life.Sreda, Qualgro, Spring Singapore and Lion Rock, in 2015.\n\nMobikon also made two acquisitions in the past. In 2015, it acquired Singapore-based Trii.be, which owns a customer feedback management tool. While in 2016, it bought Mumbai-based social and marketing solutions provider MassBlurb.\n\nIn the same year, the company also made a strategic investment in Hipcask which is an online pre-buying and gifting platform for alcohol and coffee.\n\nBansal had resigned as group chief executive officer at the homegrown e-commerce firm Flipkart following allegations of personal misconduct in late 2018.\n\nSince then, he has turned into one of the most active angel investors in India. This year, he invested in supply-chain tech startup Increff, digital insurance startup Acko, SaaS startup TerraView and ace designer Masaba Gupta's fashion label.", "description": "Restaurant marketing and analytics platform Mobikon has raised $12.5 million (Rs 88 crore) in its Series C round led by Flipkart", "authors": ["Debjyoti Roy"], "top_image": "https://assets.vccircle.com/uploads/2018/11/Binny2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
