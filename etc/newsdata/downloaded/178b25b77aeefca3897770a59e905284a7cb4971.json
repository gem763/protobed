During a hearing this summer in the U.S. Senate on drone security, Harry Wingo, a professor at the National Defense University, said that DJI\u2019s market access in the U.S. \u201cliterally gives a Chinese company a view from above of our nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cDJI says American data is safe, but its use of proprietary software networks means how would we know?\u201d said Wingo.\n\nThe company responded with a letter to the Senate committee calling the testimony \u201cunsubstantiated speculation\u201d and \u201cinaccurate.\u201d\n\nBritish military said it does not employ Chinese-built drones, the country\u2019s police forces do \u2014 frequently.\n\n\u201cDJI drones do not share flight logs, photos or videos unless the drone pilot deliberately chooses to do so,\u201d the company said in the letter. \u201cThey do not automatically send flight data to China or anywhere else.\u201d\n\nEyes in the sky\n\nWhile DJI told POLITICO it wouldn\u2019t disclose details of contracts with governments, a number of European militaries and law enforcement authorities are confirmed to have agreements with the company.\n\nThe French military, which could not be reached for comment, employs commercial off-the-shelf DJI drones for surveillance and inspection purposes. The German navy also uses drones, and a military spokesperson said he was \u201cnot aware of any security issues\u201d that have been raised by that drone use.\n\nConversely, the Dutch ministry of defense said in an email that concerns surrounding Chinese-built drones are \u201cwidely known in the Dutch military. For this reason we do not use the mentioned drones in a reconnaissance role.\u201d The Netherlands uses the U.S.-built Raven drone instead, and uses Chinese-made drones \u201cfor different communications sections in order to make footage of exercises and deployments.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Danish military confirmed: \u201cA number of DJI drones have been bought for unclassified and non-operational use, such as news-production, inspection of drain-pipes and advertisement in connection to property sales,\u201d adding: \u201cFor classified military purposes other systems are acquired.\u201d\n\nBut any decision not to buy Chinese has consequences. The Raven, built by company AeroVironment specifically for militaries, costs $260,000. DJI\u2019s Mavic Pro 2, which anyone can buy from Amazon, costs less than $2,000.\n\nThe French military used the earlier model of the Mavic Pro in operations in the Sahel, and said the drone \u201ccan be launched instantaneously,\u201d noting it has the ability to parse through a wooded area before the military sends people in. The drone \u201cexemplifies the new combat methods brought by micro-drone technology and demonstrates to what extent drones can facilitate operations,\u201d according to the French army magazine Fantassins.\n\nAccording to the U.S. interior department, U.S.-made alternatives to DJI\u2019s drones \u201cwere up to 10 times less capable for the same price, or up to 10 times more costly than similarly capable DJI aircraft.\u201d\n\nWhile the British military said it does not employ Chinese-built drones, the country\u2019s police forces do \u2014 frequently. In a DJI blogpost, a police official for Devon and Cornwall said they mostly use the drones for missing people searches, firearms operations, road traffic collisions, crime scenes and major events (such as football matches or large music festivals) and fire safety.\n\nA police spokesperson told British media in May: \u201cThere is a possibility that data is being captured without our knowledge, but within our unit, DJI drones are only used within areas of policing that are considered non-sensitive.\u201d\n\nVulnerabilities\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to prove how vulnerable the data produced by drones actually is, and governments are reticent to detail how exposed they are to danger. The 53-page report from the U.S. interior department did not make public test results from the Pentagon, and it is unclear on what evidence the U.S. military made its decision not to buy Chinese.\n\nIn May, a 13-year old hacker known as Cyber Ninja made a live demonstration at a conference in South Africa out of hacking into and controlling a drone. Last year, sensitive data from U.S. military drones was stolen and sold online. DJI itself was exposed to a security flaw that allowed potential hackers to log into DJI consumer accounts without needing a password. The company said it fixed the flaw.\n\nUnder GDPR, companies are allowed to move data outside of the EU under so-called standard contractual clauses.\n\nUnder Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, the EU has rules detailing companies\u2019 responsibility to protect private data, but a 2o14 EU study acknowledged information from drones might still be difficult to secure. Drone technology \u201cis not a reliable method of ensuring confidentiality of the data as data security and integrity can be endangered by modes of transmission such as satellites, Wi-Fi, and other broadcast technologies,\u201d it said. As drones proliferate, the risks of misuse increases.\n\nWhen asked about the protections, a spokesperson for the European Commission said: \u201cIt\u2019s up to member states to decide on what drones to buy and to ensure that the data they gather with these drones is secure.\u201d\n\nUnder GDPR, companies are allowed to move data outside of the EU under so-called standard contractual clauses, with the approval of the Commission. That means DJI can send data collected by its drones to its offices in China.\n\nManufacturers argue it is in their interest to protect customer data. \u201cWe want our customers to use our products and services,\u201d said Paula Iwaniuk, speaking for the Drone Manufacturers Alliance Europe, of which DJI is a member. \u201cWithout solid data protection and cybersecurity standards, that would not be possible.\u201d\n\nFor its part, DJI says it is doing everything it can to make sure drones are secure. In June it unveiled a so-called Government Edition product line with enhanced security, to give government agencies \u201ctotal control over their data,\u201d said Mario Rebello, the company\u2019s vice president and regional manager of North America.\n\nGasparic, DJI\u2019s strategic director, said the company accesses data only in exceptional cases \u2014 if a customer complained that the drone malfunctioned, for example, the company would check to see what happened. As part of its privacy policy, DJI said it can also collect \u201cinformation about your non-DJI device\u201d that would include IP addresses, hardware or geolocation data, as well as \u201cany photo or video ... submitted using DJI products and services.\u201d\n\n\u201cDrones generate very sensitive data and vast amounts of it,\u201d said Arthur Holland Michel, the co-director of the Center for the Study of the Drone, a U.S.-based research institute. \u201cAnd all data is vulnerable.\u201d\n\nIndustry wars\n\nThe concerns in the U.S. have left Washington scrambling on alternatives. \u201cThe domestic production capability for small unmanned aerial systems is essential to the national defense,\u201d U.S. President Donald Trump is reported to have said in a June 10 memo.\n\nTaking their lead from the president, U.S. software developers in July said they would stop working with Chinese manufacturers.\n\nFrench company Parrot was in May selected by the U.S. Department of Defense to build short-range reconnaissance drones, despite competition from DJI.\n\nThat could prove lucrative for DJI\u2019s competitors, including companies in Europe: French company Parrot was in May selected by the U.S. Department of Defense to build short-range reconnaissance drones, despite competition from DJI. The French military in June contracted Novadem, another French company, to build 50 drones that weigh 1 kilogram and will be used for surveillance operations.\n\nBut it may already be too late, given the effective monopoly DJI has. \u201cDJI drones are just so much more available,\u201d said Holland Michel.\n\n\u201cOur drones are readily available, affordable, and do 80 percent of what they are supposed to do,\u201d said DJI\u2019s Gasparic, adding that they are an automatic fit for the work that public safety agencies need drones to do.\n\n\u201cWe want to be a proactive and responsible custodian,\u201d he said.\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
