Mandatory credit Kyodo/via REUTERS\n\nWoods will resume on Monday morning at 18 under-par after 11 holes of his final round at Narashino Country Club, while local favourite Matsuyama will pick back up at 15 under with six holes left.\n\nNobody else is closer than six shots in what is realistically a two-horse race, which got a little bit interesting when Matsuyama notched two consecutive birdies to give himself a glimmer of hope.\n\nBut the first PGA Tour event in Japan is very much in Woods\u2019 control and asked if he would allow himself to think of matching Snead\u2019s mark, the American did not bat an eyelid.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to win, no doubt about that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf I do what I\u2019m supposed to do and get the job done, then I get a W. I guess that will add up to the 82 number, but my main focus is doing what I need to do to get the W first.\u201d\n\nSnead recorded his 82nd victory in 1965, at the age of 52, nine years older than Woods\u2019 current age.\n\nIt was a marathon day for the entire field, more than 10 hours and 29 holes for Woods before darkness forced the suspension of play, and certainly a stern test for a 43-year-old in his first event since undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his left knee.\n\nBut Woods passed with flying colours and then some in front of an enthusiastic but exceedingly polite sellout crowd that had its loyalties split between the 15-times major champion and Japan\u2019s top player.\n\n\u201cTiger, yusho (victory),\u201d a fan called out as Woods walked towards the seventh green.\n\nWoods for his part was pleased with the way he came through the long day.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s been a long day in the saddle. Everything held up pretty good,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that easy, and considering that I had the stress of having the lead and being under the gun for that long, it\u2019s a long period of time having come off of a knee procedure and haven\u2019t really stressed it like this.\u201d\n\nHe was also pleased with how we handled things mentally.\n\n\u201cTen hours, that\u2019s a long period of time to be focused, and in and out of focus,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe mind tends to wander a little bit and got to grab it and make it come back and be 100 percent committed on the shot.\u201d\n\nWhile Saturday\u2019s second round was completed behind closed doors due to muddy conditions the course was remarkably dry on Sunday, with a few damp spots but nothing more.\n\nThe greens remained extremely soft, allowing players to fire aggressively at the pins.\n\nWoods shot 66 in the third round on Sunday morning and had a three-shot lead over Matsuyama after 54 holes, which is where it remained as darkness fell.\n\nThe final round will resume at 7.30 a.m. local time (2230 Sunday GMT).", "description": "Tiger Woods moved within sight of matching Sam Snead's record of 82 PGA Tour victories, three shots clear of Hideki Matsuyama with seven holes left at the rain-affected Zozo Championship on Sunday.", "authors": ["Andrew Both", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445408607&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q06L", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
