Hundreds of Kurds have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced, but the president has dismissed any humanitarian concerns in his usual surreally glib style, comparing the Turks and Kurds to brawling children. He has waved off concerns about ISIS prisoners escaping with the unnerving assurance that most of them were recaptured.\n\nBut there is one thing about the chaotic situation that does seem to preoccupy the president: oil. Precious, precious oil. Over the past weeks, through tweets and public statements, he has made it clear that he considers the protection of it a very high priority.\n\nTRUMP on Syria's oil: \"We've secured the oil and, therefore, a small number of US Troops will remain in the area. Where they have the oil. And we're going to be protecting it, and we'll be deciding what we're going to do with it in the future.\" pic.twitter.com/nKgmXS4yRx \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 23, 2019\n\nCNN reported on Thursday that the U.S. would send tanks and troops to an area of eastern Syria to reinforce Kurdish defenses guarding oil fields there. As The Guardian notes, \u201cIt is quite likely it would take more troops to deploy, maintain, supply and protect armoured units in the middle of the eastern Syrian desert than the roughly 1,000 that were in the country before the Turkish invasion.\u201d\n\nThe question of why the U.S. has the right to another country\u2019s oil \u2014 especially as it is supposedly completely withdrawing from that country \u2014 has received surprisingly little attention amid the ongoing disaster in Syria. But the notion that American\u2019s central goal in the Middle East is plunder of natural resources recalls conspiracy theories around the U.S. invasion of Iraq. And Trump\u2019s current obsession with this point recalls his own sentiments about that war (which he falsely claims not to have supported). In 2013, Trump tweeted, \u201cI still can\u2019t believe we left Iraq without the oil.\u201d Axios reported last year that Trump repeatedly floated the ludicrous idea to Iraq\u2019s prime minister that the country should repay the U.S. \u2014 in oil \u2014 for the favor of having invaded it.\n\nAs the Washington Post explains, oil production in Syria has plummeted during the course of its devastating civil war, which began in 2011. But the country is still rich in the resource \u2014 that ISIS managed to turn into a moneymaking enterprise when it swept across parts of the country in 2014. The Kurdish force that was until recently backed by the United States still controls oil fields in the northern and eastern parts of the country; in 2018, hundreds of Russian mercenaries and pro-government Syria forces were killed when they clashed with U.S. soldiers and Kurds in an attempt to wrest some of the oil fields away. But it\u2019s not clear whether the Kurdish-controlled fields are currently functional.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump tweeted, \u201cPerhaps it is time for the Kurds to start heading to the Oil Region!\u201d \u2014 seeming to suggest that the staunch U.S. allies should wholly relocate from the region they\u2019ve fought and died to secure and instead focus their energies on helping the Trump administration out with its narrow interests a little more. This suggestion was reportedly not greeted warmly.\n\nKurds say they didn\u2019t sacrifice 11,000 men and women fighting ISIS with US special forces to become guards for remote Syrian oil fields. \u2014 Richard Engel (@RichardEngel) October 24, 2019\n\nNevertheless, Trump was at it again on Friday, attempting to justify his unjustifiable foreign-policy blunder by citing the securing of oil fields (and, oh yeah, bringing U.S. troops back home).\n\n....COMING HOME! We were supposed to be there for 30 days - That was 10 years ago. When these pundit fools who have called the Middle East wrong for 20 years ask what we are getting out of the deal, I simply say, THE OIL, AND WE ARE BRINGING OUR SOLDIERS BACK HOME, ISIS SECURED! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 25, 2019\n\nAs the Kurds try to regroup amid the death and destruction around them, they can comfort themselves by knowing that the commander-in-chief of their erstwhile ally has his heart in the right place.", "description": "President Trump seems more concerned about plundering Syria\u2019s oil than he is about the human misery he unleashed when he gave Turkey the green light to invade Kurdish territory.", "authors": ["Benjamin Hart"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/25/25-donald-trump-syria-oil.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
