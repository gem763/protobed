The Royal Canadian Mounted Police declined to comment.\n\nTrudeau, who arrived 90 minutes late for the event, addressed the rally without incident. His wife Sophie had been due to introduce him but did not do so.\n\nTrudeau, who often plunges into crowds to shake hands and pose for photos, did the same as he was leaving the event, but this time he was closely surrounded by security, said Mahe.\n\nUnlike the United States, where four presidents have been assassinated since 1865, there is almost no history of serious political violence in Canada.\n\nThe one exception came in 1970, when a radical group seeking independence for Quebec kidnapped the Canadian province's deputy premier and later killed him.\n\nTrudeau will go ahead with plans to campaign in the Ontario city of York north of Toronto on Sunday, said a Liberal official who declined to be named given the sensitivity of the situation.\n\nPolls show the Liberals are tied with the official opposition Conservatives of Andrew Scheer, who on Sunday said that if he won on Oct. 21 he would quickly move to end what he called government subsidies to rich corporations.
