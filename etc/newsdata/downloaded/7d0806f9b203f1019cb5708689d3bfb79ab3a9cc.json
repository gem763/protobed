Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who is running in Democratic primaries, reaffirmed his stance on health care by reintroducing a \"Medicare-for-all\" bill, the idea that fueled his 2016 presidential run.\n\nAs with its previous iterations, Sanders' latest bill would establish a national, single-payer Medicare system with vastly expanded benefits. Sanders' plan would also prohibit private plans from competing with Medicare and would eliminate cost-sharing. New in this version is a universal provision for long-term care in home and community settings (though Medicaid would continue to cover institutional care, and states would determine the standard of eligibility).\n\nAlready, it has an impressive list of Senate co-sponsors \u2014 including some of Sanders' rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination: Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.\n\nBut many of the candidates \u2014 even official \"Medicare-for-all\" co-sponsors \u2014 are at the same time edging toward a more incremental approach, called \"Medicare for America.\" Proponents argue it could deliver better health care to all Americans while avoiding political, budgetary and legal objections.\n\nThis movement to embrace a more incremental policy comes as politicians tread carefully over the political land mines a \"Medicare-for-all\" endorsement could unleash, while seeking to capitalize on voters' growing appetite for health overhaul.\n\nDuring the 2018 midterm election campaigns, some congressional candidates talked about allowing younger people \u2014 anyone older than 55 \u2014 to join Medicare or allowing people younger than 65 to buy into it if they choose (what's come to be called the public option). Many candidates aren't eager to face the industry opposition a full-on Medicare expansion would surely trigger.\n\nFrom the consumer perspective, a sweeping overhaul poses a risk. Despite Medicare's popularity with its beneficiaries, the majority of Americans express satisfaction with their health care, and many are nervous about giving up private options. Also, many analysts are worried that a generous \"Medicare-for-all\" plan that promises everything would break the bank if it didn't include copayments from patients.\n\nThat tension is pushing a number of candidates toward an option that has come to be called Medicare for America. The bill was introduced last December with little fanfare by two Democrats \u2014 Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois. It hasn't been reintroduced in the new Congress.\n\nThis proposed system would guarantee universal coverage, but leave job-based insurance available for those who want it. Unlike \"Medicare-for-all,\" though, it would preserve premiums and deductibles, so beneficiaries would still have to pay some costs out-of-pocket. The bill would allow private insurers to operate Medicare plans as well \u2014 a system called Medicare Advantage, which covers about a third of the program's beneficiaries currently and which would be outlawed under \"Medicare-for-all.\"\n\n\"Before policies get defined, what you see is people endorsing a plan that is a little, perhaps, less subject to early attack,\" says Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster with Lake Research Partners. \"A lot of candidates feel if they endorse a plan that leaves some private insurance, they get more time to say what their ideas are about.\"\n\n\"Medicare for America\" got its first high-profile endorsement from former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who launched his own 2020 bid for president in mid-March. Other candidates \u2014 including Warren, Gillibrand and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind. \u2014 have tiptoed toward that policy without making any endorsements, suggesting they back \"Medicare-for-all\" in theory but also support a system that retains private insurance, at least temporarily.\n\nSuch an approach is perhaps unsurprising. Recent polling indicates voters want strong health care improvement. And candidates need something powerful to deliver, election analysts say.\n\nSimply improving the Affordable Care Act \u2014 an idea backed by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat running in the primary's moderate lane \u2014 may not suffice.\n\n\"The ACA is popular at the 50 percent level, but it's not energetic,\" says Robert Blendon, a political analyst at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \"It doesn't get people who really like it. What they're looking for is something that is exciting but isn't threatening.\"\n\nBoth \"Medicare-for-all\" and \"Medicare for America,\" pollsters note, offer something that presidential candidates can campaign on \u2014 a health care alternative that, at first blush, sounds appealing to many. But the latter proposal might more easily skirt some potential obstacles.\n\nIn polls, approval for the concept of \"Medicare-for-all\" drops when people learn that under such a program, they would very likely lose their current health plan (even if the government-offered plan could theoretically provide more generous coverage).\n\nAnd, meanwhile, the cost-sharing element of \"Medicare for America\" would ostensibly quiet some concerns that have been raised about paying for Medicare's expansion. (Still, critics on the left worry it would mean some people would remain unable to afford care.)\n\nThis also tracks with recent polling suggesting that while \"Medicare-for-all\" support can be swayed, voters of all political stripes favor some way to extend optional Medicare coverage, without necessarily eliminating the private industry altogether.\n\nEmployers would either have to offer plans that were at least as generous as the government program or send their employees to Medicare. And employers who stop offering health benefits would have to pay a Medicare payroll tax.\n\nFor now, most candidates are still avoiding a concrete stance on the \"Medicare for America\" plan. Despite signs of interest, the Buttigieg, Gillibrand and Warren campaigns have all declined to directly answer questions about whether they endorse \"Medicare for America.\" The campaigns of other candidates in the race \u2014 Harris, Klobuchar, Booker, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee \u2014 similarly declined to comment.\n\nReading between the lines, though, their promises to achieve universal health care by expanding Medicare \u2014 while retaining private insurance \u2014 leave them few options aside from something like \"Medicare for America,\" argues Jacob Hacker, a political scientist at Yale University and one the proposal's main architects.\n\n\"There are variations besides this particular plan, but once you start to actually dig into this, if you want universal coverage you're going to have to do the kinds of things\" spelled out in \"Medicare for America,\" Hacker says.\n\nStill, though, the plan Hacker helped design has prompted objections from both the left and the right.\n\nOn the far left, the cost-sharing component is a dominant concern. (Under \"Medicare for America,\" an individual would have a $3,500 out-of-pocket annual limit; a family would have a $5,000 limit. Premiums would be capped at almost 10 percent of a household's income.) Critics on the left also say the plan's accommodations to private insurance limit the government's ability to negotiate lower prices.\n\nMeanwhile, conservatives repeat many of the arguments levied against \"Medicare-for-all\" \u2014 that the plan is too expensive, too disruptive.\n\nPolitical analysts predict that contributors to the health care industry who have already mobilized against \"Medicare-for-all\" \u2014 including hospitals, insurers, drugmakers and many doctors \u2014 also can be expected to make a strong showing against \"Medicare for America.\" More Medicare means less revenue for the medical industry.\n\n\"The fact of expanded Medicare will be the focus of attacks,\" says the Commonweath Fund's David Blumenthal.\n\nThe nonprofit newsroom Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent part of the Kaiser Family Foundation.
