The identity of the author will remain anonymous.\n\nTwelve, the book\u2019s publishing company, said the author did not take an advance to write the book. If royalties are to be collected, the author plans to donate the profits \u201csubstantially\u201d to non-profits focused on government accountability around the world, the publisher said.\n\nThe fallout of the original piece was swift, with the president tweeting that the author was \u201cfailing\u201d and probably in the administration \u201cfor all the wrong reasons.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes the so-called \u2018Senior Administration Official\u2019 really exist, or is it just the Failing New York Times with another phony source?\u201d Trump tweeted on Sept. 5, 2018, the day the op-ed was published. \u201cIf the GUTLESS anonymous person does indeed exist, the Times must, for National Security purposes, turn him/her over to government at once!\u201d\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary at the time, called the author a \u201ccoward\u201d and called for the anonymous source\u2019s resignation.\n\nTrump later tweeted: \u201cTREASON?\u201d\n\nTrump frequently deploys those accusations about many of his critics on Twitter and elsewhere. One of the most recent recipients was the whistleblower central to his impeachment inquiry, whom he has called treasonous while questioning their authenticity.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/86/41/187d57e240ceaec9af036517702b/191022-warning-anonymous-twelve-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
