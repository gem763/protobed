My colleagues @KhyatiRajvanshi and @SreenivasanJain report that 22 out of the 27 MPs are affiliated to European far right parties including Le Pen\u2019s party and the Brexit party. \u2014 Nidhi Razdan (@Nidhi) October 28, 2019\n\nThe Europeans will be the first foreign group visiting Kashmir since August. This month, US members of Congress expressed concern over a lack of access for diplomats and foreign media.\n\nOn Monday, the EU legislators met Modi who said the visit would give them a clear view of the development priorities of the region, his office said.\n\nModi, making the biggest political move in Jammu and Kashmir since an armed revolt erupted in 1989, has said that special rights for Kashmir, such as a ban on outsiders buying property, had hindered its development.\n\nWithin the region, which includes the Hindu-dominated Jammu region and the Buddhist enclave of Ladakh, the turmoil that was confined to the disputed Kashmir Valley had held back the development of other parts of the state.\n\n\"Their visit to Jammu and Kashmir should give the delegation a better understanding of the cultural and religious diversity of the region of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh,\" Modi said.\n\nAn Indian official said the EU group's visit would open the door to visits by others. India is trying to counter Pakistan on the international stage. Islamabad has accused New Delhi of unleashing genocide in Kashmir.\n\nFormer Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti, one of the scores of leaders detained since August, said on Twitter she hoped the politicians would be allowed free access.\n\n\"Hope they get a chance to speak to the people, local media, doctors and civil society members. The iron curtain between Kashmir & the world needs to be lifted.\"", "description": "Delegation of 27 EU politicians from 11 countries to meet with officials and residents to assess Kashmir situation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/28/64939aa8065f4afc90b60ee5fb77f97c_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
