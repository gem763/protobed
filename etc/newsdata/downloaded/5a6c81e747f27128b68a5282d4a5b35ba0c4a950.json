She earns money by placing ads on her YouTube channel and promoting products on her Instagram page (166,000 followers) and podcast, \"Thick & Thin.\"\n\nBellotte said, on average, she earns between $5,000 and $2,400 for a sponsored Instagram post. For an Instagram Story slide, she asks $500 per frame, she said.\n\nShe said it's hard to pin down one exact rate, and that when working with a brand, Bellotte and her YouTube manager will set a rate depending on the \"sponsorship package.\" A package will typically include one Instagram post, a Story, and sometimes a 30- to 60-second mention in a YouTube video, she said.\n\nBellotte noted that this comes before taxes and that she pays taxes quarterly. She said she saves 40% of every sponsorship paycheck for taxes.\n\nBellotte's channel. Hello Katy/YouTube\n\nHow Bellotte got started on YouTube\n\nBellotte's first brand sponsorship was with the makeup brand BH Cosmetics. They sent her a $40 eyeshadow palette in exchange for a video promoting the product on her YouTube channel, she said.\n\n\"This was back when a brand could ask you to post something in exchange for a product,\" she said, but added that today, influencers charge for a video mention and should not accept free products as payment.\n\nBellotte said she doesn't reach out to brands, and that most sponsorship opportunities come from the brand emailing her, or from her management (Matter Media Group) setting up opportunities for her.\n\nRead more: The top 14 talent managers for YouTube creators and influencers who are shaping the future of digital media\n\nEither the brand will say what it wants and how much it's looking to pay, or pitch a concept. Bellotte and her manager will send back a proposal and cost.\n\n\"All of this is facilitated through my management,\" she said. \"I would not be able to handle the workload of this on my own.\"\n\nHer management receives a 20% cut, she said.\n\nWhat brands are paying for\n\nBellotte said in her experience, brands will pay more for a package than a single post.\n\nShe said after she posts the sponsored content to Instagram, the company will typically come back and ask for specific performance metrics, like how many views a story got, or for the impressions on a sponsored Instagram post. She said some brands will also ask for \"saves,\" or how many people saved the post to their personal account.\n\n\"You'll notice there are some creators out there who are getting smart about this,\" she said. \"Saying, 'to enter my giveaway you have to save the post and then do X, Y, Z.' Then when brands ask for the save numbers, they have an inflated number because they'll do things like that.\"\n\nFor more on how to become a successful influencer, according to YouTube and Instagram stars, check out these Business Insider Prime posts:", "description": "Katy Bellotte, a social-media influencer, said she earns the bulk of her money promoting products to her followers on Instagram and YouTube.", "authors": ["Amanda Perelli"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da4b1cecc4a0a01882dfaf9?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
