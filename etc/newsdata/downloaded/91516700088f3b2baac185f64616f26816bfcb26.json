REUTERS/Brian Snyder/Files\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is considering the move, three sources briefed on the matter said on Friday, in what would be a radical escalation of U.S.-China trade tensions.\n\nIt would be part of a broader effort to limit U.S. investment in Chinese companies, two of the sources said. One said it was motivated by the Trump administration\u2019s growing security concerns about the companies\u2019 activities.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he had noted the reports on delisting and the response from the U.S. Treasury, which said there were no plans to block Chinese listings \u201cat this time\u201d.\n\nChina-U.S. trade and financial cooperation is mutually beneficial, Geng told a daily news briefing.\n\n\u201cExerting maximum pressure and even seeking the forced decoupling of China-U.S. relations will harm the interests of Chinese and American companies and people, create turmoil in financial markets, and endanger global trade and economic growth,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThis does not accord with the interests of the international community.\u201d\n\nGeng said he hoped the United States would work with China to deepen economic and financial cooperation, and that the United States would take a \u201cconstructive attitude\u201d toward resolving differences.\n\nStocks in mainland China fell to their lowest in almost a month on Monday on the news that the United States may curb Chinese companies\u2019 access to U.S. capital markets, stoking fears of a major escalation in the trade war.\n\nThe news comes just ahead of celebrations in Beijing on Tuesday marking 70 years since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China, at which President Xi Jinping will oversee a massive military parade.\n\nThe United States and China have been locked in an escalating trade war for over a year. They have levied punitive duties on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other\u2019s goods, roiling financial markets and threatening global growth.\n\nIn June, U.S. lawmakers from both parties introduced a bill to force Chinese companies listed on American stock exchanges to submit to regulatory oversight, including providing access to audits, or face delisting.\n\nChinese authorities have long been reluctant to let overseas regulators inspect local accounting firms - including member firms of the Big Four international accounting networks - citing national security concerns.\n\nChina and the United States are due to resume high-level talks next week in Washington on their increasingly bitter trade war.\n\nChina hopes Beijing and Washington will resolve their trade dispute \u201cwith a calm and rational attitude\u201d, Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen, who has been part of China\u2019s negotiating team, said on Sunday.", "description": "China warned on Monday of instability in international markets from any \"decoupling\" of China and the United States, after sources said the Trump administration was considering delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges.", "authors": ["Michael Martina", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435448921&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T0E1", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
