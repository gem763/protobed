I know you\u2019re lying but I still find you very plausible and appealing.\u201d\n\nIf you catch yourself wondering why, after two seasons of blithering incompetence, the Roy children are each performing masterfully in \u201cDC,\u201d Rhea\u2019s words are a start. They may make errors in business strategy or miss social cues or trip over their own half-considered duplicitousness, but they thrive at shoveling high-stakes bullshit. The Roys \u2014 and the executive floor at Waystar Royco in general \u2014 are at their best when called upon to do their worst, because they have that \u201csuperpower,\u201d that ability to lie and obfuscate without the feelings of shame that make ordinary people human. Rhea decides she can\u2019t be part of that culture, but she wouldn\u2019t have fit in anyway. She\u2019s not fluent enough in the language.\n\nWritten by creator Jesse Armstrong, \u201cDC\u201d has a notably darker, more serious tone than other episodes this season, as it reckons with the fallout from the Brightstar cruise scandal. It\u2019s also a necessary reminder that these people who entertain us so much every week are, in fact, rotten to the core. That\u2019s been an issue with antihero TV from The Sopranos onward: Spend enough time with charismatic villains \u2014 even tragic ones, like Kendall here \u2014 and viewers will come to care about them and resent challenges to their power. Watching an entire episode where the Roy family and their inner circle are denying or belittling or outright suppressing efforts to hold Waystar accountable for pervasive sexual abuse (and possible drownings) on its watch, as well as obstructing justice through missing documents and wiped hard drives, is a necessary splash of cold water to the face.\n\nThe bad behavior begins with Logan and the gang gathering around the television for the much-feared interview with a longtime Brightstar accountant who knows where the bodies are buried. (Or submerged, as it were.) As the accountant talks about decades of sexual exploitation and harassment under \u201cMo\u201d Lester, and the unexplained deaths and passengers overboard, Roman, Tom, Connor, and everyone else get their hisses and slanders in, as if they were watching the heel in a WWE match. One particularly pungent detail stands out: the acronym NRPI (No Real Person Involved), applied to sex workers or migrants, rather than passengers and members of staff. Onboard, apparently, distributions between humans went well beyond first class and coach. It also leads to this priceless exchange, reminiscent of the scene in The Wire where Bunk and McNulty examine a crime scene using nothing but different variations of the word \u201cfuck\u201d:\n\nKendall: \u201cSo \u2026 bad. Bad, but \u2026 uhh \u2026\u201d\n\nRoman: \u201cYeah, but not too bad.\u201d\n\nHugo: \u201cBad, I think. Very bad.\u201d\n\nFrank: \u201cI would agree. Bad.\u201d\n\nRoman: \u201cYeah, it\u2019s obviously fucking bad, Frank. We\u2019re talking here about how bad.\u201d\n\nHugo: \u201cWell, just from a PR perspective, I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to underplay how bad it was.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s just brilliant writing, and a revealing insight into how executives in a similar situation might look at incidents like this \u2014 not through any sense of personal regret or accountability, but as an assessment of damage to the company\u2019s reputation. The thinking immediately turns to possible talking points about the whistle-blower angling for a book deal and the senior cadre not knowing anything about what happened all those years. They also consider throwing Bill, the man who ran cruises during the relevant period, under the bus, despite the fact that Bill had dutifully worked to tidy up the mess for their benefit. His loyalty means nothing to them. (And, as we discover later, he knows that fact well enough to protect himself.)\n\nWith Connor relegated to the sidelines as usual \u2014 though kudos to him, in retrospect, for giving away nothing at Lester\u2019s funeral \u2014 the three Roy children all perform their roles to perfection. Logan entrusts Roman with the huge assignment of lobbying a Turkish bank for enough money to take Waystar private in case the shareholders revolt and Sandy/Stewy have the votes they need for a successful takeover. And Roman works the room masterfully, at least until he and his shady business partners are interrupted by mysterious gunmen. Kendall protects his dithering father with an aggressive performance before a congressional committee that paints the hearing as a partisan move by Gil Eavis and other Democrats eager to muzzle ATN. (And ATN makes Kendall\u2019s testimony the propagandistic takeaway, much as Fox News might under similar circumstances. Plus they have friends in Congress willing to talk about what a wonderful time they had on their own cruises.)\n\nWhat Shiv pulls off is the most delicate and artful form of ratfucking, because she partly believes in her own unctuous sales job. Talking a sexual-harassment victim out of testifying is such vile work that Rhea can\u2019t bring herself to engage, but Shiv identifies an existential threat to the family business, so she turns up the pressure. This is \u201csoft-skills, lady-duty shit work,\u201d in her words, and her play is to align herself with the victim, making her believe that she has an ally within the company who will help destroy the men responsible for what happened to her. But she goes further than that still: She warns that the forces against the victims are powerful enough to ruin her life \u2014 or, at best, redefine it forever. \u201cFrom tomorrow,\u201d she says, \u201cthat\u2019s all you\u2019ll ever be. To your grandkids, to the people you meet on vacation. When they Google you, pages and pages of filth and lies. First line of your obituary.\u201d It\u2019s hard not to think of women like Christine Blasey Ford, someone whose reward for coming forward was endless harassment, smears, and death threats, and the man who allegedly attacked her appointed to the Supreme Court anyway.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial for Rhea to draw that line in the end. We\u2019ve seen how much she\u2019s excelled at the ruthless backstabbing and gamesmanship that got her the CEO appointment in the first place, but she has her limits. The Roys are a different species of monster, and Succession can\u2019t be seen as celebrating their comprehensive affront to decency. Their sociopathy is the company\u2019s DNA.\n\nSad Sack Wasp Traps\n\n\u2022 So who\u2019s the \u201cblood sacrifice\u201d? Tom makes the most sense, since he\u2019s been a patsy all season long \u2014 \u201cthe meat in the sandwich,\u201d as he puts it. His appointment to cruises seemed to be insurance for just such a moment, when the Roys would need a dopey fall guy for their sins. He\u2019s also exposed during testimony as a guy who knew about Lester\u2019s reputation and surely knew about what the company had been busy covering. Yet Tom isn\u2019t technically \u201cblood,\u201d which makes Greg the next logical choice. It\u2019s already known that Greg was rooting around the archives on Thanksgiving Day, after all, and the family has treated him more like an affable mascot than legitimate member. Of course, Greg\u2019s instinct for self-preservation turns out to be as keen as Bill\u2019s, as the Roys may soon discover.\n\n\u2022 Greg gets one of the funniest moments of an episode that doles them out sparingly \u2014 after rejecting his quarter-billion-dollar inheritance for Waystar, he says, \u201cI can drink these drinks. These are drinks for people, right?\u201d \u2014 but his righteous fury at Tom for screwing him over is a new look for him. He\u2019d been happy to serve as Tom\u2019s apprentice, the patsy\u2019s patsy, but the good times are over.\n\n\u2022 There\u2019s a brief indication that Marcia might be out of the picture after Logan\u2019s behavior around Rhea, but it\u2019s hard to know yet whether the break is permanent. I\u2019ll miss her withering glares.\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s funny to hear Hugo reminding to \u201ceat, eat, eat those dangerous fucking minutes\u201d by filibustering his testimony, because it\u2019s usually members of Congress who eat up their own time by grandstanding, rather than interrogating the person in front of them. It has the effect of letting foes off the hook.\n\n\u2022 \u201cYou can\u2019t make a Tomlette without breaking some Gregs\u201d will also be the subject line of the email I sent to my editor with this recap attached.", "description": "In the fallout from the cruise scandal, the Roy children prove they\u2019re at their best when called upon to do their worst.
