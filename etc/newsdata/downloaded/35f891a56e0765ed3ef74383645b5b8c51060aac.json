Plumes of smoke rose from within Syria, where Turkish artillery and aircraft were targetting positions of the Kurdish-led militia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame what happened here,\u201d says Salih Mehmet, a 46-year-old resident of a neighbourhood where a missile struck the second storey of a house.\n\nRussia, which has emerged as the primary power broker in Syria amid a pullback by the US, appeared at the centre of a tangle of secret backroom deals.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

On the Manbij issue we\u2019re at the stage of implementing our own decision.\u201d\n\nManbij is the largest city of Aleppo province after Aleppo itself and serves as the bridge connecting the eastern Euphrates area to Aleppo. It includes Syria\u2019s second-largest dam, and is the resting place of Suleyman Shah, the father of the founder of the Ottoman Empire.\n\n\u201cWe are most worried about Manbij,\u201d says Wissam Zarqa, a Syrian opposition activist and Manbij native who is now a professor at Ankara\u2019s Beyazit Yildirim University.\n\n\u201cIt seems now that the Syrian regime and the Free Syrian Army will both try to enter the city, and that will create problems for the city.\u201d\n\nSyria\u2019s armed forces are no match for Turkey. The Syrian Arab Army is badly depleted after nearly nine years of civil war, prompted by an armed popular uprising against the Assad dictatorship. Virtually all of its significant battlefield victories are credited to Russian air power and highly motivated Iranian-backed militias, including Lebanese Hezbollah.\n\nMeanwhile, Turkey has the second-largest land force in Nato as well as a modern fleet of armoured vehicles, supported by advanced fighter jets, artillery and tanks. It has already seized control of swaths of Syria\u2019s northwest. In Akcakale, fighters of the Syrian National Army, the Turkey-backed Arab irregular armed force made of remnants of the rebel units that fought against the Assad regime, could be seen positioning themselves along the border.\n\nWe are most worried about Manbij. It seems now that the Syrian regime and the Free Syrian Army will both try to enter the city, and that will create problems for the city Wissam Zarqa, Syrian opposition activist from Manbij\n\nBut geopolitical considerations may hamper Turkey\u2019s quest to seize control of Manbij. Russia controls much of Syria\u2019s skies. Although Mr Erdogan hinted that Moscow had approved Turkey\u2019s push to take both Manbij and Kobane; the Kremlin has long sought to broker a deal between the regime and the Kurds.\n\nOn Monday, Mr Erdogan also referred to a previous deal between Turkey and the US for the SDF to leave Manbij and hand it to local allies. That deal was never honoured, Turkey insists, becoming a source of friction between Washington and Ankara.\n\nThe murky, evolving dangers on the ground were cited by Trump administration officials as being behind the decision to pull all remaining US troops out of northeast Syria, including from an outpost in Manbij.\n\n\u201cYou not only have Turkish forces there, you have local forces, you have the SDF that will be manoeuvring against the Turkish forces, you have [Isis] that killed four Americans not far from those outposts in Manbij back about eight months ago,\u201d a senior US State Department official told reporters on Sunday. \u201cThat was a very prudent and wise decision.\u201d", "description": "The withdrawal of US troops from northeast Syria and a series of undisclosed deals brokered by Russia have triggered\u00a0a scramble for the key city of Manbij, potentially pitting Turkish forces and its allied armed groups against forces loyal to the regime of President Bashar al-Assad.", "authors": ["Borzou Daragahi"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/14/17/Syria-Turkey-Manbij.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
