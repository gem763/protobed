It's despicable.\"\n\nIt then emerged that in a 1998 CNN interview, Mr Biden said: \"Even if the president should be impeached, history is going to question whether or not this was just a partisan lynching or whether or not it was something that in fact met the standard, the very high bar, that was set by the founders as to what constituted an impeachable offense.\"\n\nSkip Twitter post by @JoeBiden This wasn\u2019t the right word to use and I\u2019m sorry about that. Trump on the other hand chose his words deliberately today in his use of the word lynching and continues to stoke racial divides in this country daily. https://t.co/mHfFC8HluZ \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 23, 2019 Report\n\nLate on Tuesday, Mr Biden apologised for his past use of the word, but continued to condemn Mr Trump.\n\n\"This wasn't the right word to use and I'm sorry about that,\" he tweeted.\n\n\"Trump on the other hand chose his words deliberately today in his use of the word lynching and continues to stoke racial divides in this country daily.\"\n\nMr Clinton was impeached in December 1998 by the House of Representatives for lying under oath and obstruction of justice during the investigation into his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.\n\nMr Biden, then a senator for the state of Delaware, joined the majority of the Senate in voting to acquit Mr Clinton.\n\nWhich other Democrats used the term 'lynching'?\n\nNew York Congressman Jerrold Nadler also once used the term \"lynch mob\" to describe the Republican impeachment investigation into Mr Clinton.\n\nMr Nadler is now chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which will consider any articles of impeachment filed against Mr Trump.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, several other Democrats in the House of Representatives talked about a \"lynching\" or \"lynch mob\" in reference to the Clinton probe.\n\nIs impeachment damaging Biden's 2020 bid?\n\nThey include New York Congressman Gregory Meeks.\n\nMr Meeks, who is black, defended himself in a statement to the Post, saying: \"There is a difference when that word is used by someone of my experience and perspective, whose relatives were the targets of lynch mobs, compared to a president who has dog-whistled to white nationalists and peddled racism.\"\n\nWho will take on Trump in 2020?\n\nElection day is still more than a year away but the race to become the Democratic challenger to Mr Trump is already well under way.\n\nThe latest polling suggests Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden are the front-runners, while Bernie Sanders is also a popular contender. Many of the the other candidates are relatively unknown outside the Washington DC bubble.\n\nFind out more about the contenders", "description": "After condemning Mr Trump, Mr Biden apologises for using the same term metaphorically in 1998.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17A38/production/_109342869_gettyimages-1181515436.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
