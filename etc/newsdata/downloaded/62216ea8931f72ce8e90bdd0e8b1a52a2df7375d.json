There have been more requests in 2019 so far than at the same point in any of the previous five years.\n\nIn 2017, the most recent year for which figures are available, there were 75 adoptions in Hong Kong, a number comparable to previous years. The Hong Kong government estimates that last year about 7,600 people left the city for good, roughly one-third the number who sought police-record printouts.\n\nAuthorities in Malaysia, Australia and Taiwan have reported spikes in migration inquiries, and property agents from Melbourne to Vancouver say their phones are running hot.\n\n\"There are many uncertainties in Hong Kong,\" one investor on a property agent's late-August tour of suburban Melbourne said before, laying out A$600,000 ($410,000) for a house-and-land package.\n\n\"People like me in their 40s and 50s \u2014 we think about our child,\" said the investor, who gave only her family name, Lee, because her employer forbids speaking to the media.\n\n\"We want a back-up home, a better place to live,\" she added. \"At least if something bad happens, they have a back-up plan, an exit plan.\"\n\nAnd she is not alone: Lee's sentiments were echoed in interviews with 10 other families or individuals considering emigrating.\n\nChina has denounced the protests, accusing the United States and Britain of fomenting unrest, and the Hong Kong government has sought to head off further trouble by accepting one of the protesters' demands and withdrawing the extradition bill.\n\nA mass march scheduled for Sunday will test how far that has allayed public anger.", "description": "As protests in Hong Kong stretch from summer into autumn with little sign of resolution, a surge in migration applications suggests more locals are making plans to leave the special administrative region.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105520422-1540188950098gettyimages-885794240.jpg?v=1540189490", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
