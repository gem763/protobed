Farmers can use that information to regulate their inputs more efficiently.\n\nNicol\u00e1s Laserna, Farmer, and Researcher said, \"The Japanese support has been very important, very interesting for us. They have taught us a lot of things on how to manage the rice in a different way than we used to do it. They have shown us how we can use less water, and they're also introducing a lot of new tools for us.\"\n\nDROUGHT RESISTANT RICE\n\nWe then traveled to a farm near Ibagu\u00e9, where newly developed rice from the lab are being grown, saving water and fertiliser. Farmers say the new rice and agri-tech developed with the Japanese is making it easier for them to cope with the extreme weather.\n\nRuth Blanca Perdomo, Farmer said, \"We use less water, yes, it consumes less water. The climate has changed a lot, with the temperature, the sun is very hot, so they developed this type of rice to resist this environment, this warming that's taking place.\"\n\nDuring our visit, we saw how the region must cope with both, droughts in the summer and recent heavy rains that prevent the planting now, further justifying a tech approach to make cultivation more efficient.\n\nIn the capital Bogota, we spoke with the head of the programme at FEDEARROZ, the Colombian rice farmers federation, who says the work with Japanese researchers has helped its members become more productive and more competitive to boost international trade. The programme with FEDEARROZ is just one example of the century-old ties between the two countries.\n\nTrade and investment play an important part, and they stand to increase as the two countries negotiate a free trade agreement.", "description": "Japanese researchers and a private company help Colombian farmers increase their rice production and use less water, using mobile technology.", "authors": ["Chris Burns"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/70/43/89/1000x563_cmsv2_7b2ffedf-19a9-55d2-84b2-beb9fad4c998-3704389.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-15"}
