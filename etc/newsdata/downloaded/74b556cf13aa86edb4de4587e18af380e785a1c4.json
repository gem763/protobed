This was because ICF had the audacity to require that its campus group leaders were Christians.\n\nLast week, \u201cA federal court ruled University of Iowa officials must pay out of their own pockets for discriminating against a prominent Christian student group, calling the university's conduct \u2018ludicrous\u2019 and \u2018incredibly baffling\u2019 during a hearing last week.\u201d\n\nThe issue was that the university had no problem allowing secular groups on campus to make specific requirements about who could be in leadership. But when it came to a Christian group, to do so was considered discriminatory.\n\nThankfully, Judge Stephanie M. Rose of the U.S. District Court recognized that it was the university that was being discriminatory, holding the officials personally responsible.\n\nAnd what, exactly, did the university do to ICF? \u201cThe university limited the Christian group's access to campus after being there for over 25 years, froze its bank account, shut down its website and advertised that it was \u2018defunct\u2019 for lack of student interest, according to court documents. This violated the Christian group's free speech and free exercise rights, the court ruled.\u201d\n\nTalk about an ugly, totalitarian action. And all because a Christian group required that its leaders be Christians.\n\nBut it was not just the Christian group against which the university discriminated. Quite the contrary.\n\nInstead, after the court warned the university not to discriminate against another Christian group earlier last year, the officials decided to become equal opportunity offenders, kicking out Muslim and Sikh groups as well.\n\nNo wonder the judge called their actions \u201cincredibly baffling.\u201d\n\nJust think.\n\nA Democratic club can require that its leaders be Democrats.\n\nA Republican club can require that its leaders be Republican.\n\nA Greek club can require that its leaders be Greek.\n\nA Japanese club can require that its leaders be Japanese.\n\nA swimming club can require that its leaders be swimmers.\n\nAn animal rights club can require that its leaders be vegans.\n\nAn environmental activist club can require that its leaders be global warming adherents.\n\nAnd the list goes on and on.\n\nAs an Admissions page on the university website announces, \u201cChoose from nearly 500 organizations, ranging from Aikido to Dance Marathon, or start your own group!\u201d\n\nPerhaps there are even atheists\u2019 clubs on campus too? If so, we can be sure that the group leaders are required to be atheists. And there is nothing discriminatory about this. In fact, it is simple, common sense.\n\nAnyone can attend a group\u2019s meetings, since they are open to the public. Agreement is not required. But to lead the group \u2013 really, any group \u2013 it is necessary that you share that group\u2019s goals. Otherwise, how can you lead it?\n\nBut in the twisted, anti-Christian, anti-religious mindset of these university officials, Christians were being discriminatory if they forbade an atheist from being one of their leaders. Can you even imagine this?\n\nIt would sound something like this, \u201cHey, my name is Evan, and I don\u2019t believe in God. Personally, I hate the Jesus story and think the Bible is filled with dangerous myths. I also think Christians are idiots.\n\n\u201cAnd, with that introduction, welcome! I\u2019m here to lead this Christian fellowship meeting today, where followers of Jesus come together to be strengthened and edified.\u201d\n\nRight!\n\nIn the same way, the university could have required this same Christian group to have Muslims and Sikhs and Jews on their leadership team, just as they would have required one of these other groups to have Christian leaders on their team.\n\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m Angela, and I\u2019m a Christian. I don\u2019t believe the Quran is God\u2019s Word, but I do believe the Bible is. And I\u2019m here to tell you why I believe Jesus is the Son of God. With that introduction, let me welcome all my Muslim friends to this Muslim student gathering.\u201d\n\nWhat?\n\nPerhaps, however, what the University of Iowa did was not just \u201cludicrous\u201d and \u201cincredibly baffling.\u201d Perhaps it was something even worse. Perhaps it was anti-Christian and anti-religious animus that provoked their actions.\n\nHatred has a way of making people act irrationally, even highly educated people. But their irrational actions will be called out. This type of tyranny will backfire in the end.\n\nSo, may the campuses of America take heed. The push back will not stop.", "description": "In July, 2018, the University of Iowa and its officials .10/05/2019 0:50:12AM EST.", "authors": ["Michael Brown", "Beth Baumann", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/57/a7a051b8-13bf-4f28-8bb1-ec7f87342a40.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
