Dominique Yates, Louisville Courier Journal\n\nJohn Calipari means well. His instincts are paternal. His efforts at social engineering are mostly benign and arguably enlightened.\n\nBut when the University of Kentucky head basketball coach says advocates of an expanded NBA Draft are \u201ctrying to ruin college basketball,\u201d the head Wildcat is crying wolf.\n\nCollege basketball has been rocked, but it defies ruin. It has survived a long series of sky-is-falling events including point-shaving scandals, an FBI investigation, chronic cheating, the one-and-done phenomenon, the NCAA\u2019s transfer portal, Snoop Dogg at Kansas and Dick Vitale\u2019s throat surgery.\n\nRun a Google search for \u201cruin of college basketball\u201d and you get 7,490,000 results. None of them have proved fatal. None of them have proved a lasting impediment to the game\u2019s growth.\n\nYet, here was coach Cal Wednesday, predicting doom at the Southeastern Conference Tipoff in Birmingham.\n\n\"If anybody supports more rounds in the draft,\u201d he said, \u201cthose more rounds are to get kids to go to the G League. You do not care about college basketball or you're trying to ruin college basketball.\"\n\nPlease.\n\nKentucky Wildcats head coach John Calipari is sounding the alarm on a possible expansion of the NBA Draft. (Photo: Denny Medley, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nWhen Louisville\u2019s Pervis Ellison was made the first selection of the NBA\u2019s first two-round draft in 1989, college basketball was the league\u2019s de facto farm system. There was no Development League \u2013 now known as the G League -- and the NBA\u2019s entire player payroll was roughly $170 million, or less than half of what the Los Angeles Lakers will pay LeBron James over the course of his current contract.\n\nNow, with the average NBA franchise valued at nearly $2 billion (as of February, according to Forbes), it seems both inevitable and wise that the league would start investing more heavily in its player pipeline. And it seems pointless to try to prevent it.\n\n\"If I'm the owner of an NBA team and I have a G League affiliate, I don't want to just protect two guys (through the draft),\u201d Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said, per the Associated Press. \u201cI want to protect everybody.\"\n\nWOLVERINES: Michgian lands first five-star recruit in Juawn Howard era\n\nOPINION: AAC coaches gave Hardaway, Memphis exactly the motivation they needed\n\nJAYHAWKS: Bill Self said Kansas fully intends to 'fight' NCAA allegations\n\nHOOPS RANKINGS: Way-too-early top 25 teams for the 2019-20 season\n\nMuch as the NBA has benefitted from college basketball, both as a training ground and in building the brands of individual players, the interests of the two entities are not identical.\n\nWhile NCAA officials and many coaches (Calipari included) would do away with the NBA\u2019s age limit and, with it, the problematic perceptions of one-and-done, the league has resisted a change that would likely lead to more multi-million-dollar mistakes.\n\nWhile the G League has yet to become a viable alternative for top-flight prospects, efforts to improve its salary structure have the potential to impact college basketball\u2019s talent pool. Elite players who are least 18 years old but not yet eligible for the NBA Draft can now sign a \u201cSelect Contract\u201d worth $125,000 for a five-month season.\n\nThat\u2019s not lifetime wealth, but it has its allure. Calipari\u2019s concern is that an expanded draft will prompt more players to take a path that leads to a dead end.\n\n\"After two years they don't perform, what? The NBA is going to take care of them and hire them? No. It's entertainment. You're done,\" he said.\n\n\"If they're not going to the NBA, if we're really about young people, we should encourage them to go to college. And the reason is their way out is through education. Their way to break through to the American dream is education.\"\n\nNo argument there. But a coach being compensated at $9.2 million annually invites cynicism when he lobbies for limiting the career choices of players who receive no salary. And he invites eyeball rolls when he predicts a change in the NBA Draft could result in the ruination of college basketball.\n\nNot every basketball prospect will pan out, and many of them will miscalculate their abilities relative to an intensely competitive marketplace. More than half of the underclassmen who declared for June\u2019s NBA Draft were not selected.\n\nYet 105 rookies made their NBA debuts last season, and 21 of them played at least 1,000 minutes. At season\u2019s end, 52% of active NBA players had spent time in the G League.\n\nSomehow, college basketball survived. Reports of its ruin are exaggerated.\n\nFolloq Tim Sullivan on Twitter: @TimSullivan714.", "description": "Kentucky basketball coach John Calipari says those pushing for an expanded NBA draft are out to ruin college basketball.", "authors": ["Tim Sullivan", "Published P.M.
