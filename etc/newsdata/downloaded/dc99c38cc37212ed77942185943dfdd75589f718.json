While it\u2019s still unclear what path Hurricane Dorian will take, Vasquez wanted to make sure that people who do have to evacuate will get a helping hand.\n\nCONTINUING COVERAGE OF HURRICANE DORIAN ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL\n\n\u201cI just believe if people need help, you help them,\u201d he told Fox News. \u201cIt sucks to evacuate and although most probably have money to pay, just a gratis meal makes people feel a little bit of relief.\u201d\n\nThe owner of The Appetite Repair Shop in New Orleans, Vasquez said he believed in doing the right thing.\n\nRESTAURANT SERVER'S HEARTWARMING MOMENT WITH WWII VETERAN GOES VIRAL: 'IT WAS A TOUCHING SIGHT'\n\n\u201cI stand for certain things and never waver on what is morally right,\u201d the chef continued. \u201cMy morality isn't led by a dollar. Virtually nothing about me is! I feed the homeless regularly out of my own pocket (and some generous customers).\u201d\n\nVasquez said he\u2019s closed down shop before to go help out where it\u2019s needed, like when Texas needed help after the damage inflicted by Hurricane Harvey.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThese things come at great expense to me as when I close, I close,\u201d he explained. \u201cThere's no income, but to me, it doesn't matter. There's \u2018the right thing to do\u2019 and then there are excuses.\u201d\n\nHurricane Dorian strengthened to a Category 5 storm before it made landfall in the northern Bahamas on Sunday. Forecasters have warned its path could still change and states along the southern East Coast of the United States have been bracing for possible impact.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nVasquez had some thoughtful closing words. \u201cHow these things affect me doesn't matter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's what we do for others that define our character. We could feed, clothe and house everyone for what we throw away, but we don't.\u201d\n\nFox News' Alexandra Deabler and Travis Fedschun contributed to this report.", "description": "One New Orleans chef wants to make evacuating less stressful, even if it\u2019s only by giving out one meal at a time.", "authors": ["Michael Hollan"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/storm-evacuation.jpg"}
