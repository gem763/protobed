Mr Giuliani, who has shown himself to be a scrappy defender of the president, even went as far on Sunday as to say he would not cooperate with any investigation by Mr Schiff \u2014 only to contradict himself moments later and during the same interview.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t cooperate with Adam Schiff,\u201d he said Sunday during an interview with ABC News's George Stephanopoulos. \u201cI think he should be removed. If they remove Adam Schiff and put a neutral person in, a Democrat who hasn\u2019t expressed an opinion \u2014 if I had a judge in the case and announced he was going to impeach, wouldn\u2019t I move to recuse that judge.\u201d\n\nWhen the host pressed him \u2014 \"you're not going to cooperate?\" \u2014 Mr Giuliani shot back, indicating he will comply with whatever Mr Trump wants: \"I didn't say that. I said I would consider it.\"\n\nThe subpeona released Monday cites a separate interview of Mr Giuliani's as an example, as well. That interview, from 19 September, occurred on CNN.\n\n\"So, you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden,\" CNN's Chris Cuomo asked him then.\n\nMr GIuliani responded: \"Of course I did.\"\n\nThe subpoena continues to note that Mr GIuliani has said, on live television, that he is \"in possession of evidence \u2014 in the form of text messages, phone records, and other communications \u2014 indicating that you were not acting alone\" when he was allegedly advocating on behalf of the president's personal interests.", "description": "Donald Trump's personal attorney\u00a0Rudy Giuliani\u00a0has been subpoenaed for documents related to his work in Ukraine on behalf of\u00a0the president, marking\u00a0the latest escalation of\u00a0the impeachment inquiry launched by House Democrats just last week.", "authors": ["Clark Mindock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/26/19/giuliani-call.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
