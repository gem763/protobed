Turkish forces currently control about a quarter of that length, captured in the past nine days.\n\nThe rest is held by the Kurdish-led forces or by the Syrian government military, backed by Russia, which the Kurds invited to move in to shield them from the Turks. None of those parties has much reason to let Turkish forces into the areas.\n\n\"No US ground forces will participate in the enforcement of the safe zone, however, we will remain in communication with both Turkey and the SDF,\" Esper told reporters on Friday.\n\n191018073856826\n\nEsper said he will be travelling to the Middle East and Brussels in the coming days to discuss issues including the future of counter-ISIL campaign.\n\nHe also said he had spoken with his Turkish counterpart on Friday and reiterated that Ankara must adhere to the ceasefire deal and ensure the safety of people in areas controlled by Turkish forces.\n\n\"Protecting religious and ethnic minorities in the region continues to be a focus for the administration. This ceasefire is a much-needed step in protecting those vulnerable populations,\" Esper said.\n\nISIL prisoners\n\nEsper added that he reminded Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar of Turkey's responsibility for maintaining security of ISIL prisoners in areas affected by Turkey's operation.\n\nOfficials have said a number of ISIL fighters, likely just over 100, have escaped custody since Turkey launched its operation last week.\n\n191018081244364\n\nA US defence official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the US would continue aerial surveillance in northeast Syria to monitor prisons holding ISIL fighters.\n\nThere was shelling and machine-gun fire earlier on Friday, but Trump told reporters that things are back to a \"full pause\".\n\nHe also claimed \"big progress\" against ISIL in Syria, saying some European countries are now willing to take responsibility for detained ISIL fighters who are from their countries.\n\n\"Anyway, big progress being made!!!!\" he exclaimed on Twitter. A day earlier, he had proclaimed that a US-brokered ceasefire deal with Turkey marked \"a great day for civilisation\". Trump said nothing further about the European nations he contended had agreed to take some of the ISIL fighters.\n\n'Sometimes you have to let them fight it out'\n\nTrump was widely criticised for turning on the Kurds, who had taken heavy casualties as partners with the US in fighting ISIL since 2016.\n\nWhile US officials have insisted that Trump did not authorise Turkey's operation, the ceasefire codifies nearly all of Turkey's stated goals in the conflict.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the US had accepted the idea of a safe zone long pushed by Turkey, and he insisted Turkish armed forces will control the zone. He also made clear that Turkey will not stop at a previously limited zone; he said Turkish control of the Syrian side of the border must extend all the way to the Iraqi border.\n\nCaught in the middle, the commander of Kurdish-led forces in Syria, Mazloum Abdi, told Kurdish TV, \"We will do whatever we can for the success of the ceasefire agreement.\" But one Kurdish official, Razan Hiddo, declared that Kurdish people would refuse to live under Turkish occupation.\n\nTrump seemed to endorse the Turkish aim of ridding the Syrian side of the border of the Kurdish fighters. \"They had to have it cleaned out,\" he said.\n\nDuring a campaign rally in Texas on Thursday night, Trump said, \"Sometimes, you have to let them fight, like two kids in a lot, you got to let them fight and then you pull them apart.\"\n\n'US abandoned an ally'\n\nLeading US politicians, including many from Trump's own party, were less pleased with the president.\n\n191017211339805\n\nSenator Mitt Romney, the Republicans' presidential nominee in 2012, said he welcomed the ceasefire but it \"does not change the fact that America has abandoned an ally\".\n\nWhile the ceasefire seemed likely to temporarily slow legislation in Congress aimed at punishing Turkey and condemning Trump's US troop withdrawal, politicians gave no sign of completely dropping the measures.\n\nShortly before the announcement of the pause in hostilities, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen introduced legislation that would bar US military aid to Turkey, seek to curb foreign arms sales to Ankara and impose sanctions on top Turkish officials unless Turkey withdraws its forces.\n\nThe senators said they planned to move \"full steam ahead\" with the legislation despite the ceasefire deal.", "description": "US defence chief also says US will continue its 'deliberate withdrawal from northeastern Syria'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/9/6/bea6dbee055d45618301dd55fe4c10ed_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
