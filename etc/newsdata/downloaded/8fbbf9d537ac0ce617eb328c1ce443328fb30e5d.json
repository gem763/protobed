View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nA central question in the lawsuit, as in previous federal and state lawsuits, is the role of courts in shaping climate policy.\n\nAttorneys for Our Children\u2019s Trust represented Alaska youth in an unsuccessful 2011 lawsuit that sought court intervention because the state had failed to adopt measures to protect young people in Alaska from climate change. The judge concluded that courts lack scientific, economic and technological resources that agencies can use to determine climate policy and it was best left in their hands.\n\nThe second lawsuit was filed in October 2017 by Alaskans who at the time ranged in age from 5 to 20. Anchorage Superior Court Judge Gregory Miller in October 2018 dismissed the lawsuit, citing the 2011 case and other precedents.\n\nWelle acknowledged that courts cannot create climate policy. However, a court can intervene if the other two branches of government approve policies that exacerbate harmful effects, he said\n\n\u201cTheir core role within that system of checks and balances is to make sure that the other branches are not actively and affirmatively harming individuals through official state action,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what\u2019s at issue in this case.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit claims that under Alaska\u2019s Constitution, the state climate, like water, fish, wildlife, air and ocean, is a public trust resource held for maximum benefit of its people.\n\nHuman-caused climate change will be catastrophic unless atmospheric carbon dioxide declines, according to the lawsuit. Among damages already occurring: dangerously increasing temperatures, changing rain and snow patterns, rising seas, storm surge flooding, thawing permafrost, coast erosion and increased wildfires, ocean acidification and violent storms.\n\nThe lead client in the case, Esau Sinnok, has had his constitutional right to health and happiness denied by state policy and lack of action on climate change, Welle said.\n\n\u201cHis home village of Shishmaref is literally wiped off the map because of climate change,\u201d Welle said. \u201cIt\u2019s endangering his culture, the very existence of his community, the health and safety of him and his community members.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit asked the court to declare that state actions have violated the plaintiffs\u2019 fundamental rights to a stable climate system.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to have the state policy on fossil fuels declared invalid.\n\nThe lawsuit also asked the court to order the state to prepare an accounting of carbon emissions and create a recovery plan.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The court will hear arguments in a lawsuit that claims state policy on fossil fuels is harming the constitutional right of young Alaskans", "authors": ["Dan Joling"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/alaska_climate_change_lawsuit.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
