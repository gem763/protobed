I grew up in a New Jersey suburb that, to my mind\u2019s eye, bore more than a passing resemblance to the fictional town in \u201cStranger Things.\u201d While I enjoyed shows like \u201cSquare Pegs\u201d and movies like \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d I was perplexed by how homogeneous they were, especially since my high school had nearly an even balance of black and white kids.\n\nThat\u2019s where Jet magazine came in. At that time, black faces were still rare enough on the big and small screens that the publication printed out a listing of every black performer appearing on American television that week. Thanks to those listings, I discovered a magnetic performance by one of my favorite stars Diahann Carroll, who died this week at 84.\n\nIt was from the NBC TV movie \u201cSister, Sister,\u201d which first aired in 1982. Written by Maya Angelou, the story follows three very different siblings and their struggle to heal old wounds and sell their family home following the death of their mother. In one of my favorite scenes, two of the sisters (played by Ms. Carroll and Rosalind Cash) confront each other about long-held secrets and their screaming match turns to blows. It is glorious and satisfying \u2014 a \u201ccat fight\u201d that would make the \u201cDynasty\u201d divas Dominique Devereaux and Alexis Carrington applaud in respect.\n\nEven when she was sparring onscreen, Ms. Carroll\u2019s class and elegance went unquestioned, but early in her career, the public perception of her commitment to issues affecting black Americans was another matter. Like many black stars in the \u201960s and \u201970s, her personal and professional moves were scrutinized relentlessly. She wore clothes by white designers, married white men and, to the untrained eye, appeared to live in a mostly white world, seemingly oblivious to \u201creal\u201d problems. Her character on \u201cJulia\u201d was a single mother, and aside from the occasional guest star the show lacked a consistent black father figure.", "description": "Early in her career the \u201cDynasty\u201d star was criticized for being oblivious to issues facing everyday black Americans.
