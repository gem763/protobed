Yes, we know we can. And we\u2019ll need to play better in our next game.\u201d\n\nAfter two games against lower tier opposition, England will come up against a Pumas side fighting for survival after their opening defeat to France.\n\n\u201cWe understand they are going to be playing for their lives,\u201d said Jones. \u201cThey are a proud, passionate rugby country so what\u2019s going to be important is we match their passion and we play with a fair bit of control and smarts about the game.\n\n\u201cThey are a difficult team to beat.\u201d\n\nJones also highlighted the improvements made by the lower tier countries at the World Cup with the likes of Russia and Uruguay, as well as England\u2019s previous opponents Tonga and the United States, giving a good account of themselves.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing the tier two countries are much better physically prepared. We\u2019ve played against Tonga and America now and they\u2019ve all got big physical packs, they\u2019re fitter than they ever have been, and it\u2019s a great thing for the World Cup,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the tier two countries have been loudly calling for more games against the elite teams, Jones said it was hard to satisfy their demands.\n\n\u201cThe little brothers are never happy, they always want more,\u201d he said.\n\nStandoff Ford said England had used the rolling maul to good effect against the Eagles, with both Vunipola and Cowan-Dickie touching down from them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s traditionally one of England rugby\u2019s strengths ... it\u2019s an incredible weapon when you get it going,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe work the lads put in to score a couple of tries off driving mauls is huge, especially in conditions like that.\u201d", "description": "Two games, two bonus-point wins, no major injuries -- England are right where they need to be at the World Cup, coach Eddie Jones said on Thursday after his side's seven-try win over the United States.", "authors": ["Peter Rutherford", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434186373&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P1DU", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
