While the price of crude oil remains above $50 per barrel, natural gas prices have fallen below $2.50 per 1000 British thermal units (BTUs).\n\nThe companies hurt the most are the exploration & production (E&P), or \u201cupstream\u201d firms, which depend most heavily on high oil prices. Since all they do is drill and sell raw product, revenues move up and down with market prices. However, low prices do not necessarily make life easy for the \u201cmidstream\u201d companies who transport oil and gas or the \u201cdownstream\u201d firms who must refine and sell. Hence, oil stocks in general have suffered as they continue to overproduce.\n\nHowever, such conditions have created buying opportunities in many oil stocks. For those with an eye for bargains and the courage to speculate like an oil driller, some investors will set themselves up for a gusher of profits long-term. These stocks to buy could lead investors to such a windfall.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n\n\n\n\nBrookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBrookfield Infrastructure (NYSE:BIP) has become one of the more diversified oil stocks, in this case, diversified by industry. It invests in what it calls the \u201cbackbone of today\u2019s global economy.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s assets go well beyond pipelines. It also owns transport assets for utilities, energy, transportation, and data. They own assets spread across the globe, keeping them diversified by both industry and geography.\n\nIn the past, the company had grown by acquisition. Now, it continues to churn assets to buy assets it believes will produce higher returns. It also wants to focus more on organic growth.\n\nAt a forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of almost 28.7, it might appear expensive. However, this is also a company expected to generate an earnings growth rate of 159.3% this year. Admittedly, the emphasis on organic growth will slow that down in future years. However, that slower growth will bring cash flows, which should fuel the dividend higher.\n\nAside from a years-long pattern of slow but steady price growth, the dividend also makes BIP stock a lucrative choice. Its annual payout of $2.01 per share yield around 4.28%. The company has also hiked this payout for nine consecutive years. With this generous dividend and the ever-increasing dependence on these pipeline transport, BIP should continue as a reliable source of stock price growth and cash flow.\n\n\n\n\n\nCheniere Energy (LNG)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nArguably, no company defines technological change for oil stocks more than Cheniere (NYSEAMERICAN:LNG). Their growing network of export terminals turned natural gas exports from a hemispheric to a global industry.\n\nMany call the U.S. the \u201cSaudi Arabia of natural gas.\u201d Thanks mostly to Cheniere, America\u2019s abundant natural gas supplies can now reach the world. Natural gas prices in the European Union had often reached levels three times higher than in the U.S. Now in Europe, natural gas trades for around $3.60 per 1000 BTUs. One year ago, that price had crossed the $9.50 per 1000 BTUs level. Access to natural gas from North America played a significant role in this decline.\n\nDespite this improvement, LNG stock has struggled for years. Today, the forward PE ratio stands at about 19.6. This is due to falling profits for the year. However, next year, Wall Street expects a turnaround. Analysts forecast a 90.9% earnings increase for fiscal 2020. They also foresee profit growth averaging 29.3% per year over the next five years. As Cheniere helps to bring low-priced natural gas to the rest of the world, it should finally return LNG stock to a pattern of growth.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Thanks to a seemingly endless supply of oil coming from the Permian Basin of Texas and other places, oil and gas prices, and often oil stocks, have struggled to gain traction.
