Here's everything we know about the candidate and how he stacks up against the competition.", "language": "en", "text": "Who is Joe Biden?\n\nCurrent job: Candidate for president.\n\nAge: 76\n\nFamily: Biden is married to Jill Biden, an educator. Together they have a daughter named Ashley. From Biden's previous marriage to Neilia Hunter, he has a son, Hunter, and daughter, Ashley. While married to Hunter, with whom he also had a one-year-old daughter named Naomi, the two were killed in an automobile accident in 1972. Biden's other son with Hunter, Beau Biden, died in 2015 after suffering from brain cancer.\n\nHometown: Scranton, Pennsylvania.\n\nPolitical party: Democratic.\n\nPrevious jobs: Vice President of the United States from 2009-2017; US senator from Delaware 1973 to 2009; public speaker; author.\n\nWho is Joe Biden's direct competition for the nomination?\n\nBased on a recurring series of national surveys we conduct, we can figure out who the other candidates competing in Joe Biden's lane are, and who the broader opponents are within the party. We can see which other candidates' voters Biden will have to court to run a successful campaign.\n\nThe average Biden-satisfied respondent said they were satisfied with 3.3 other candidates , which is the second-lowest number of rivals for a candidate in the race. That's good: it means that people who like Biden tend to be narrowing down their choices. While he's locked down the most support, it's worth noting only 16.1 percent of Biden supporters said they were satisfied with him and him alone.\n\nBiden is well positioned in the race, as many people who would be satisfied with him as nominee are unconvinced about almost all of the other candidates in the race. Typically, we see that fans of one candidate often like another candidate in the race more than your typical Democrat, generally because those two candidates share an ideology, identity, or geography. Overall, this isn't the case with Biden.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren perform about as well among Biden supporters as they do among Democrats in general. While generally they are understood to have significant political differences within the party, about perform about as well among Biden supporters as they do among Democrats in general. While generally they are understood to have significant political differences within the party, about half of people who would be satisfied with Biden as nominee would also be satisfied with Sanders as nominee. This may be read as either a credit to their shared perception of electability, or merely a note on how early it is in this race.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke round out the top four, but Harris and O'Rourke actually do considerably worse among Biden fans than they do among those who say they're going to vote in the democratic primaries more generally. This is a weakness shared by all of the other people in the race. round out the top four, but Harris and O'Rourke actually do considerably worse among Biden fans than they do among those who say they're going to vote in the democratic primaries more generally. This is a weakness shared by all of the other people in the race.\n\nINSIDER has been conducting a recurring poll through SurveyMonkey Audience on a national sample to find out how different candidate's constituencies overlap. We ask people whether they are familiar with a candidate, whether they would be satisfied or unsatisfied with that candidate as nominee, and sometimes we also ask whether they think that person would win or lose in a general election against President Donald Trump.\n\nRead more about how we're polling this here.\n\nWhat are Joe Biden's political positions?\n\nHow much money has Joe Biden raised?\n\nAccording to campaign finance numbers released by the campaign, Biden has donors from every state, US territory, and congressional district. The campaign also said 97% of donations are under $200, with two-thirds being under $25.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2019, Biden raised $21 million, more than almost any other candidate, with an average donation size of $49. His campaign also reported having $10.9 million cash on hand.\n\nWhat are Joe Biden's political successes?\n\nBiden served as chairman of two influential committees during his career in the Senate, including Judiciary and Foreign Relations.\n\nHe Introduced the Violence Against Women Act, which President Bill Clinton signed into law in 1994.\n\nHe was elected vice president twice, in 2008 and 2012.\n\nHow is Joe Biden viewed by voters compared to the competition?\n\nINSIDER has conducted a number of other polls to check in on how these candidates are perceived in comparison to one another. When we asked respondents to one poll to rank how far to the left or to the right they considered the candidates, Biden was generally considered to be one of the more centrist candidates in the field, coming in 10th place among the 20 candidates then polled. Biden was by far considered to be the most experienced candidate in the field when we asked respondents to rank the candidates based on how prepared they are for the rigors of the presidency given what they knew about their history of public service and experience with government. And when asked how likable or personable respondents perceived the candidates to be, Biden again emerged on top.\n\nCould Joe Biden beat President Trump?\n\nReferring back to INSIDER's recurring poll, Joe Biden overall is believed to be the strongest candidate in a general election against Donald Trump by Democrats. For most candidates, a majority of respondents are unsure of how the person would fare in the general, but not Biden. Among those who said they were probably Democratic primary voters, typically about 70% say they think Biden would win, which is roughly double the overall average for the Democrats we asked about. Zooming out to all respondents, not just Democrats, a slight majority thought Biden would beat Trump in the general and about half that thought he'd lose, with the remainder not sure.\n\nHow do Democratic voters feel about Joe Biden's qualifications?\n\nINSIDER has conducted polling about how voters feel about candidate attributes or qualifications. We asked respondents about a list of possible qualifications and if they made them more likely or less likely to vote for a candidate for president.\n\nFor example, among respondents who said they'd vote in the Democratic primary, 19% said a candidate being a college professor made them likelier to support them, while 4% said it made them less likely to, for a +15% net favorability. We can then see how different candidates' resumes stack up compared to those preferences.\n\nAttributes perceived as most valuable include his released tax returns (+43%), time as Vice President (+39%), middle class upbringing (+36%) and 20+ years of government service (+21%).\n\nAttributes considered to be a liability based on the preferences of self-reported Democratic voters include his status as a foundation owner (-4%), his vote for the 1994 crime bill (-8%), his age 70 or over (-24%) and vote for the Iraq War (-30%).\n\nRead more of our stories on Joe Biden:", "description": "The former vice president under President Barack Obama is the early frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic nomination.", "authors": ["Joe Perticone", "John Haltiwanger", "Joseph Zeballos-Roig"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d6e9e072e22af206f31e475?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
