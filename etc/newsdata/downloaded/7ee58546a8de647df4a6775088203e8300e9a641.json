As a result of the discovery, she kicked Daniel out and, he ended up hitting rock-bottom \u2014 as he collapsed by the canal.\n\nTensions were high between Daniel and Sinead during Monday night\u2019s episodes, as Daniel made clear how he felt about Craig (Colson Smith), Beth (Lisa George) and Kirk\u2019s (Andrew Whyment) impromptu Christmas celebration.\n\nSinead wasn\u2019t best pleased about her husband\u2019s overprotectiveness, and as a result she told him to leave.

Curious, she proceeded to read Bethany\u2019s short story, and came to the conclusion that she was in love with Daniel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Daniel returned home, Sinead confronted him with her discovery \u2014 and she told him how the short story demonstrates Bethany\u2019s love for him. Daniel made every effort to deny such a claim, but Sinead begged him to be honest with her.\n\nEventually, Daniel complied, as he revealed he\u2019d kissed Bethany. Sinead was understandably devastated once more and ordered him out \u2014 and Beth and Craig were quick to make their true feelings about what Daniel did known once they learned the truth.\n\nDaniel began drinking, and Adam (Sam Robertson) did his best to talk him round, but it was ultimately no use \u2014 as he headed off on his own. Afterwards, Tracy (Kate Ford) and Peter (Chris Gascoyne) headed off in search of him.\n\nThe episode concluded as a drunk Daniel stumbled along the canal, and \u2014 with his vision beginning to fail him as a result of the amount of alcohol he\u2019d consumed \u2014 he collapsed to the floor.\n\nSinead\u2019s running out of time, so will Daniel manage to come to his senses and return home to see his dying wife before it\u2019s too late?\n\nThe young woman will pass away at the end of the week, but will Tracy and Adam manage to track Daniel down in time?\n\nCoronation Street continues on Thursday 24thOctober at 8:30pm.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Despite her having only a little bit of time left, Sinead learned of Daniel's betrayal with Bethany \u2014 and Daniel hit rock bottom.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Daniel-Osbourne-in-Coronation-Street-4056_1571835026.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
