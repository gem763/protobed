The ball is reversing a bit, that\u2019s his strength.\u201d\n\nShami now has three five-wicket hauls in the second innings since 2018, most by any bowler, and four of his five South African victims were dismissed bowled.\n\nOne of them was du Plessis, who shoulder-armed to a delivery and watched in horror as his off-stump went cartwheeling.\n\nIndia opener Rohit Sharma said it was just reward for the quick, who offered no respite to the batsmen.\n\n\u201cHe makes the batsman play all the balls, which is slightly tough on that kind of pitch,\u201d said Rohit, whose twin centuries in his first match as a test opener earned him man-of-the-match award.\n\n\u201cWhen you know you have to play all six balls, and the pitch at times, as we have seen, is doing something from the crack, or staying low at times...the batsman doesn\u2019t really know what\u2019s coming next, because he (Shami) can swing it both ways.\u201d\n\nShami said it took more than just his ability to reverse-swing the ball.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to bowl when you know reverse-swing is happening,\u201d said the 29-year-old.\n\n\u201cYou need to pitch it in the right area, you need to make sure that the ball is just around off stump, so that it comes and hits the middle stump. Otherwise sometimes you can drag (the ball onto pads) and leak a lot of runs.\u201d", "description": "Fast bowlers usually play second fiddle to their slow-bowling counterparts on the final day of tests on the sub-continent but Mohammed Shami's performance in India's test win over South Africa in Visakhapatnam on Sunday told a different story.", "authors": ["Amlan Chakraborty", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
