It declined by as much as 0.68% against the euro (GBPEUR=X), to \u20ac1.11, a four-week low.\n\nAccording to a Downing Street source, Merkel said that the UK must accept that Northern Ireland must remain part of the European Union\u2019s customs union if it wants to reach agreement on a deal with the bloc.\n\nThe pound fell to a four-week low against the euro on Tuesday.

But it declined to comment further.\n\n\u201cAs usual, we do not report from such confidential conversations,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\nThe Downing Street source described it as a \u201cclarifying moment\u201d for Johnson.\n\nA spokesperson for the European Commission said on Tuesday that the EU\u2019s position \u201chas not changed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want a deal, we are working for a deal with the United Kingdom, and under no circumstances will we accept that the EU wants to do harm to the [Good Friday Agreement]. The focus of our work is to protect it in all its dimensions.\u201d\n\nA proposal put forward by Johnson last week would see the controversial backstop, which is designed to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland, replaced with a system that would include \u201cdecentralised\u201d economic controls.\n\nThough Northern Ireland would leave the EU\u2019s customs union, an \u201call-island regulatory zone\u201d could be implemented on a rolling basis every four years.\n\nThe plans have been rejected by the business community in Northern Ireland and the majority of political parties there, and the EU believes that the plan could cause major disruption to Ireland\u2019s all-island economy and harm the Good Friday agreement.\n\nThe 1998 agreement ushered in 20 years of relative peace and stability on the island of Ireland.\n\nIn the 30 years before it was signed, clashes between unionists and republicans \u2014 known simply as the Troubles \u2014 took the lives of more than 3,600 people.\n\n\u201cSterling is under the cosh again as hopes of a deal between the UK and EU fade. The last flicker of hope was snuffed out this morning after a call between the prime minister and chancellor Merkel of Germany left the process at an impasse,\u201d said Neil Wilson, the chief market analyst at Markets.com, in a note.", "description": "Downing Street has now concluded that a Brexit deal is 'essentially impossible' after a phone call between Merkel and Johnson.", "authors": ["Edmund Heaphy", "Finance", "News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RK4Bh.ek6lrKmt2v_wnG9A--~B/aD0xMTQ1O3c9MTYxMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/a816cae0-e9b1-11e9-bedf-3d50d86f0952", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
