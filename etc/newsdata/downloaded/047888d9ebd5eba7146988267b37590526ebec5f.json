Trump has been attacking rival presidential candidate Joe Biden, saying that when he was vice president, he used his position to further his son Hunter\u2019s business interests.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like they built this facility to host this type of event,\u201d Mulvaney told reporters at the White House Thursday, saying \u201ca lot of the same criteria\u201d used for past summits were applied to choosing the site. He said the president \u201cwill not be profiting here\u201d and that Doral will be much less expensive than alternatives.\n\nThe president pitched hosting the 2020 G-7 summit at Trump National Doral at the August gathering of leaders in Biarritz, France, saying that the luxury property is \u201cvery big\u201d and that each country could \u201chave their own villa, or their own bungalow.\u201d\n\nWith the host setting much of agenda for a G-7 meeting, Mulvaney said that Trump could invite Russian President Vladimir Putin to attend the June 10-12 event, although he said that issue hasn\u2019t yet come up. He also said that climate change isn\u2019t on the agenda.\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s initial comments in August, the House Judiciary Committee said it would investigate the proposed site selection as part of its ongoing probe to determine whether to bring articles of impeachment against the president.\n\nJudiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, who criticized Trump\u2019s suggestion in August, on Thursday said the selection breached the ban on foreign \u201cemoluments\u201d to a president.\n\n\u201cThis is a blatant violation of the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution,\u201d the New York Democrats said. \u201cThe president uses his official office to bring an official function to his business to personally benefit from it. This is why the emoluments clause is written into the U.S. Constitution to prevent this type of corruption.\u201d\n\nQuickTake: Trump\u2019s Business Ties and the Problem With Emoluments\n\nNadler is party to a lawsuit, along with about 200 other members of Congress, to enforce the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause. Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, one of the Democrats on the lawsuit, said he will add Trump\u2019s G-7 decision to the complaint.\n\n\u201dIf you wanted a classic violation of the United States Constitution, you couldn\u2019t think of a clearer set of actions,\u201d Blumenthal said.\n\nSenator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, said, \u201cno\u201d when asked if it\u2019s appropriate for Trump to host the multilateral summit at his own property.\n\nThe decision got a thumbs-up, though, from Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, who said he \u201cselfishly\u201d liked to see his state get attention and that others in the nearby community would benefit from staging the event there.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to maintain his varied private business holdings while in office has drawn criticism from ethics experts and led to several lawsuits. Trump has said he\u2019s likely losing billions of dollars by serving as president.\n\nMost legal actions accusing Trump of serially violating the emoluments ban so far haven\u2019t advanced far enough to resolve underlying constitutional issues.\n\nTrump\u2019s business, the Trump Organization, has sought to counter criticism by donating profit from foreign leaders\u2019 visits to the U.S. Treasury, which his critics say is an unenforceable commitment that doesn\u2019t resolve the constitutional issue.\n\nEven if the Trump Organization turns over profit from the G-7, Doral would benefit in other ways from hosting a summit of world leaders. The resort would get free publicity that could boost future profit.\n\n(Updates with lawmaker comments beginning in the ninth paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Ben Brody, Erik Wasson and Steven T.
