And they had sharp teeth, each the size of a banana!\n\nYou definitely don\u2019t want to mess with a T. rex if you travel back 65 million years! But there are dinosaurs that may be even more terrifying...\n\nSpinosaurus\n\nReconstruction of the Spinosaurus. (Wikimedia/Durbed/CC BY-SA 3.0)\n\nThis dinosaur was big! Really big! Even bigger than T. rex!\n\nSome scientists believe it to be more than 14 metres long and weighing as much as nine tonnes, but others disagree. It got its name from the spiny sail that grew on its back.\n\nSpinosaurus was thought to be a great swimmer and didn\u2019t just hunt fish, but giant prehistoric sharks too!\n\nGiganotosaurus\n\nLife restoration of Gigantosaurus. (Wikimedia/public domain)\n\nUntil Spinosaurus was discovered, Giganotosaurus was the biggest meat-eating dinosaur around!\n\nAt 12.5 metres long and possibly weighing 13 tonnes, this is still one big dino! And it was fast.\n\nGiganotosaurus is estimated to have reached speeds of 50 kilometres an hour.\n\nAllosaurus\n\nLife restoration of Allosaurus. (Wikimedia/Fred Wierum/CC BY-Sa 4.0)\n\nWe\u2019ll never know if the Allosaurus could have beat the T. rex in a fight because they lived millions of years apart, but it would\u2019ve been a good match!\n\nThe Allosaurus roamed 150 million years ago, and was supposedly between 10.5-12 metres long and weighed two tonnes.\n\nLike the T. rex, it had a big snout with sharp teeth and powerful back legs.\n\nUtahraptor\n\nLife restoration of Utahraptor. (Wikimedia/Emily Willoughby/CC BY-SA 3.0)\n\nThe raptors in the movie Jurassic Park may have been called Velociraptors, but they were really based on the Utahraptor, the largest of the raptor type of dinosaurs.\n\nEvidence suggests that these raptors hunted in packs and were super fast, making them deadly! They could take down prey way bigger than themselves.\n\nAnkylosaurus\n\nPossible appearance of Ankylosaurus. (Wikimedia/public domain)\n\nThe Ankylosaurus was a plant-eater, but it was still tough!\n\nThis dinosaur could be over six metres long and weighed more than four tonnes. It\u2019s known for the knobby armour covering its body and a club-like tail.\n\nAnd that tail may have been used for fighting \u2014 it was strong enough to break the bones of dinosaur predators!\n\nMaybe not as scary: Velociraptor\n\nArtistic representation of Velociraptor. (Wikimedia/Fred Wierum/CC BY-SA 4.0)\n\nThis dinosaur became famous because of the Jurassic Park movies, but they weren\u2019t that menacing. Fossils suggest they were the size of big turkeys.\n\nThey were also probably covered in feathers, which makes them look even more like turkeys!\n\nBut Velociraptors did have long claws on their hind feet, which would be scary and is definitely not something we should arm turkeys with.\n\nTime to vote!", "description": "You definitely don\u2019t want to mess with a T. rex if you travel back 65 million years!
