The exact circumstances surrounding the boys\u2019 deaths are not yet known.\n\nBarrass appeared in the dock alongside her co-defendant, Brandon Machin, 39, a family member. Flanked by three security officers, they pleaded guilty to two counts of murder and one count of conspiracy to murder six children.\n\nThe pair also pleaded guilty to five counts of attempted murder during the 20-minute hearing. The conspiracy to murder charges relate to a period between 14 and 20 May .\n\nFour of the attempted murder charges relate to four children, including Blake and Tristan on 23 May. The fifth count of attempted murder took place on 24 May. The surviving children are all under the age of 13.\n\nThe judge, Jeremy Richardson QC, told the pair: \u201cNo words of mine can ever fully reflect the enormity of what you have both done. The crimes you have committed quite frankly speak for themselves. The murder of two children. The attempted murder of four children and the overarching conspiracy to murder those children.\n\n\u201cI have little doubt that each of you will in due course be sentenced to several terms of life imprisonment. It\u2019s a matter for the judge where a whole life order is imposed.\u201d\n\nThey will be sentenced on 12 November.", "description": "Sarah Barrass told to expect a life sentence after admitting killing Tristan, 13, and Blake, 14", "authors": ["Nazia Parveen"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef9dfd37bb89648deab07e9d0fea953cacea0b77/51_62_2457_1474/master/2457.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4af4be004e468855bf63d50840067494", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
