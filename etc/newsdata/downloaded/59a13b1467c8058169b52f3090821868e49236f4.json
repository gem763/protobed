And it didn\u2019t disappoint.\n\nThe event\u2019s website reported having some 50,000 registered attendees. The mostly Indian-American crowd, many of them dressed in colorful traditional garb, packed the floor and first three levels of NRG Stadium, which was decorated from end-to-end in Indian and American flags.\n\nThis year\u2019s \u201cHowdy, Modi\u201d spectacle was nearly three times the size of the crowd that turned up for Mr. Modi at New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden five years ago.\n\nMr. Trump, who makes no secret of his love for a large, rowdy rally, stood stoically on the stage as India\u2019s visiting premier lavished praise on him.\n\nMr. Modi began his introduction by saying the president\u2019s \u201cname is familiar to every person on the planet.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis name comes up in almost every conversation in the world on global politics,\u201d Mr. Modi said. \u201cHe was a household name and very popular even before he went on to occupy the highest office in this great country.\u201d\n\nMr. Modi first asked the president to attend the event at the Group of Seven summit in August, and Mr. Trump immediately took to the idea.\n\nMr. Trump told reporters on Sunday that he told the prime minister that \u201cI would make it happen.\u201d\n\nIndian music replaced the standard musical repertoire of Elton John and Rolling Stones typically heard at Mr. Trump\u2019s political rallies before he speaks. But his remarks echoed many of the key points he makes on his campaign circuit.\n\nHe pointed to the economy, his work to expand job creation and his continuing efforts to offer Houston relief after recent storms.\n\nHe tied some of his work as president to Indian prosperity, noting new defense and trade efforts between the two countries, and said the U.S. is working closely with India on endeavors in space.\n\nHis vow to protect against \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d drew a standing ovation. Tensions between Hindus and Muslims often have flared up during Modi\u2019s tenure. Last month, lawmakers in his Bharatiya Janata Party, which has roots in Hindu nationalism, moved to end the autonomous status of its disputed mostly-Muslim state of Jammu and Kashmir, drawing condemnations from opposition leaders and neighboring Pakistan.\n\nMr. Modi\u2019s appearance drew hundreds of protesters outside the stadium, according to media reports.\n\nMr. Trump told the crowd inside the stadium on Sunday: \u201cYou are proud to be Americans, and we are truly proud to have you as Americans. You have never had a better friend as president than President Donald Trump. \u201d\n\n\u201cEvery day Indian-Americans help write the story of American greatness,\u201d Mr. Trump told them. \u201cEveryone here has a crucial role to play in an even greater American and Indian future.\u201d\n\nMr. Modi\u2019s speech Sunday was his fourth address to Indian-Americans in five years. Since winning power in 2014, Mr. Modi has used the overseas rally as a means for boosting both Indian diplomacy and his political standing at home.\n\nHe has addressed diaspora audiences in Sydney, Toronto, London, Singapore, Johannesburg and elsewhere.\n\nBut the U.S., as home to about 4.4 million people of Indian origin\u2014among them, the wealthiest and most influential Indian diaspora world-wide\u2014has particular appeal for Mr. Modi. Houston alone is home to 150,000 Indian-Americans, more than half of whom were born in India.\n\nWhile in the city, Mr. Modi is expected to meet the chief executives of some of America\u2019s biggest energy companies before traveling to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly, where both he and Mr. Trump are expected to hold a formal bilateral meeting. Mr. Modi has also expressed hopes of bolstering his ties with the Trump administration.\n\nMr. Modi, who joined the crowd to listen to Mr. Trump\u2019s speech, concluded his own speech by saying: \u201cMr. President, you introduced me to your family in 2017 and today I have the honor to introduce you to my family.\u201d\n\nThe crowd jumped to its feet and let out another deafening roar.\n\nWrite to Vivian Salama at vivian.salama@wsj.com", "description": "This year\u2019s \u201cHowdy, Modi\u201d spectacle was nearly three times the size of the crowd that turned up for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden five years ago.", "authors": ["Vivian Salama", "Vivian.Salama Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109703/social", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
