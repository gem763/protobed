It was the largest supply disruption in history. On Monday, Brent oil futures shot 15% higher, the most since 2008, and the oil equities most dependent on crude prices soared as much as 20%.\n\nBy the middle of the week, however, the swan was waddling more like a common park duck.\n\nTrading returned to its previous pattern, with near-term crude futures up just a few dollars from preattack levels and September 2020 contracts almost completely retracing their gains. Investors who chased Monday\u2019s rally suffered a day later, when Saudi Arabia announced it would be able to bring back its production by the end of September, an unexpectedly rapid timeline.\n\nEven if that schedule proves to be optimistic, there is now so much oil in storage that it is unlikely the markets would see any significant disruption.\n\n\u201cThe oil price just didn\u2019t hold\u2014that has been the biggest surprise for me,\u201d says David Heikkinen, CEO of Houston-based Heikkinen Energy Advisors, an equity research firm.\n\nInvestors took some lessons from the attacks and their aftermath: that oil infrastructure is vulnerable to new kinds of attacks; that oil should get a longer-term bump of $3 to $5 to account for new geopolitical risks; and that it will take a more fundamental shift in the markets to change recent trading patterns.\n\nThe headline numbers still look gloomy. Brent crude is down 18% on a year-over-year basis, and producers are expected to pump more oil next year than consumers need. Governments hold 1.55 billion barrels of oil, enough to fulfill 15 days of global demand, the International Energy Agency says. Company-controlled stockpiles hold another 30 days worth. The U.S. and Russia each produce more oil than Saudi Arabia now, in part because of production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.\n\nFor the most part, investors continue to favor stocks they liked before the attacks\u2014companies with low leverage and strong cash return policies. Without more help from oil prices, stocks that don\u2019t meet those criteria are still considered too risky.\n\nAbsent a war or further attacks on Saudi facilities\u2014both of which remain possibilities\u2014this past week\u2019s events now look like a blip in a longer-term bearish pattern for oil prices and stocks. Energy makes up less than 5% of the S&P 500 index\u2019s market cap, the lowest level in at least 40 years.\n\nBalance of Oil Power The U.S., Russia, and Saudi Arabia are the dominant energy producers in the world. Total global petroleum and other liquids production* (millions of barrels/day) Kuwait 2.9 China 4.8 Iran 4.5 Brazil 3.4 Canada 5.3 Saudi Arabia 12.4 United States 17.9 United Arab Emirates 3.8 Russia 11.4 Iraq 4.6 Total global petroleum and other liquids production* (millions of barrels/ day) Kuwait 2.9 United States 17.9 Saudi Arabia 12.4 Russia 11.4 Canada 5.3 China 4.8 Iraq 4.6 Iran 4.5 United Arab Emirates 3.8 Brazil 3.4\n\nEnergy investors used to be willing to stick with energy stocks through bull and bear cycles because \u201ceventually the commodity would bail you out,\u201d says John Selser, portfolio manager at New Orleans hedge fund Tightline Capital. \u201cInvestors now believe that, over time, the commodity is going to be lower. Instead of going through cycles, we\u2019re in a secular decline.\u201d\n\nHeikkinen says he expects the wild market action after the attack to continue to scare off generalist investors, despite the excitement of Monday\u2019s price jump.\n\n\u201cI think that high volatility keeps them away until there\u2019s a consistent positive return in energy,\u201d he says. \u201cThis did not help or make them more interested.\u201d\n\nHeikkinen advised investors looking to take advantage of the oil spike on Monday to buy Occidental Petroleum (ticker: OXY) while shorting Exxon Mobil (XOM). His hypothesis was that highly levered oil names would outperform companies with low leverage during a shock. That phenomenon did play out\u2014but just for a day.\n\nHe also recommended Centennial Resource Development (CDEV), an oil producer that has not hedged future production\u2014meaning that it\u2019s more exposed to oil prices than companies that have used options to hedge price exposure. Another stock poised to benefit was Diamondback Energy (FANG), a shale-oil producer that also has fewer hedges than peers.\n\n\u201cWe looked for stocks that had underperformed that could have a reversion, and if they were unhedged, then their cash exposure was higher,\u201d he says.\n\nBy midweek, the trades had produced \u201ckind of a mixed result,\u201d Heikkinen acknowledged. By Thursday, Diamondback was less than 1% higher than its close from before the attacks. Centennial was up 7%. Heikkinen\u2019s instincts on Exxon and Occidental were correct, but the trade was nothing to write home about. Exxon lost less than 1% from the preattack trading day through Thursday. Occidental was up less than 2%.\n\n\u201cThe severity of the move up and the subsequent move down is a good example of why you should not trade these stocks,\u201d Selser of Tightline Capital says. \u201cI think you should maintain more of a longer-term thesis. If you owned the good companies, you participated in the move up and then you weren\u2019t hurt as much on the way down. Where you would have been hurt is if you tried to catch the move up and you got caught as they dropped.\u201d\n\nHis fund owns midstream companies like Archrock (AROC) that can benefit from drilling activity without the same price risk. Large-caps like Exxon are also appealing, Selser says. He owns some shale energy producers, too, but \u201cactively manages\u201d them, given elevated risks. \u201cWe\u2019re not chasing the rallies or selling the selloffs,\u201d he says.\n\nAt first glance, U.S. shale drillers look as if they should be beneficiaries of Saudi outages. The U.S. has become a major player in the global oil market, exporting more than three million barrels a day, or nearly four times the level of just two years ago.\n\nBut U.S. investors don\u2019t trust most shale producers to drill prudently. Neal Dingmann, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey who covers U.S. producers, says the investors he spoke to after the attacks were incrementally more bullish on oil companies, but were still being choosy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already seen people start to moderately return to the group,\u201d he says. \u201cBut they\u2019re not looking for the most levered names.\u201d\n\nDingmann likes Diamondback, as well as Matador Resources (MTDR), EOG Resources (EOG), and Callon Petroleum (CPE), which all have a \u201cnice growth profile and a very positive free cash flow yield next year.\u201d\n\nInvestors also took another lesson from the attacks: Saudi Arabian oil facilities are vulnerable to attack and face emboldened enemies. The culprits were able to breach Saudi defenses that had easily repelled prior attacks.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the U.S. have both blamed Iran for the attacks. Iran has denied involvement, though it has supported Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, who took responsibility for the attacks.\n\nIf Iran was involved, it would be another sign that the country is more willing to take risks to bolster its position, given that oil sanctions imposed by the U.S. have crippled Iran\u2019s oil industry, argues Antoine Halff, senior research scholar at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy.\n\n\u201cUntil Sept. 14, the prospect of a strike from Iran on a vital Saudi facility like Abqaiq would have seemed strategically suicidal and practically impossible,\u201d Halff wrote. \u201cFor Iran, the retaliation risk would have been too powerful a deterrent.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, \u201cthe attacks have exposed unsuspected gaps in the kingdom\u2019s defense systems.\u201d\n\nFor investors, that means it\u2019s dangerous to short oil, because more attacks are possible. And it means that oil prices should have a geopolitical risk premium for the foreseeable future\u2014one that won\u2019t outweigh the industry\u2019s supply-demand problems, but should put a floor on the price. Any further conflict will only widen that risk premium.\n\nIn addition, some investors are looking more closely at other assets that could be vulnerable to attack. Heikkinen says he likes oil and gas producer Noble Energy (NBL), but realizes that its Leviathan offshore gas project in the Mediterranean off the coast of Israel could be vulnerable to a similar attack: \u201cIf you can attack Saudi Arabia, could you attack Noble\u2019s gas assets in Israel?\u201d Other investors were probably asking the same question, because Noble stock quickly lost its gains on Monday, ending the day up less than 1%.\n\n\u201cOn Sunday I wasn\u2019t thinking that way, but then on Monday, you could see it,\u201d Heikkinen says. \u201cIt\u2019s making me think more about that.\u201d\n\nNoble didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nConversely, companies that have diversified their oil production could be in a better position. Exxon and Hess (HES) have a promising offshore project in Guyana that is looking better these days, Heikkinen notes. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a way to diversify away from Middle East exposure, I\u2019d say offshore longer-dated projects start to become more appealing.\u201d\n\nWrite to Avi Salzman at avi.salzman@barrons.com", "description": "The initial spike in oil prices after the attacks on Saudi facilities soon faded.
