It's made by the maker of Thomas Was Alone, Subsurface Circular and other games, and I can't wait until the embargo lifts so I can actually say a few words about it.\n\nBut there's also some fan favourites making a return. GRID is back this week, which I burned so many hours on as a kid. Frostpunk hits consoles, while the PS4 gets that wonderfully gorgeous Concrete Genie. Trine 4 returns to the 2D formula and the incredibly vibrant Indivisible is out after all these years.\n\nIt's a proper bumper week. Here's what to expect:\n\nJohn Wick Hex (PC)\n\nTrine 4 (Switch)\n\nConcrete Genie (PS4, PSVR)\n\nThe Bradwell Conspiracy (PC)\n\nGRID (PC, PS4, XBO)\n\nFrostpunk: Console Edition (PS4, XBO)\n\nA Winter's Daydream (PS4, XBO)\n\nPocket Stables (Switch)\n\nMable and the Wood (Switch)\n\nChroma Squad / Knights of Pen & Paper 1 and 2 (Switch)\n\nContraptions (Switch)\n\nYooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair (PC, PS4, Switch)\n\nTrine Ultimate Collection (Switch)\n\nMistover (Switch)\n\nDragon Star Varnir (PC)\n\nNorthgard (PS4, Switch Retail)\n\nDoraemon Story of Seasons (Switch Retail)\n\nCall of Cthulhu (Switch)\n\nWe Were Here Together (PC)\n\nDeliver Us The Moon (PC)\n\nValfaris (PC)\n\nRadio Commander (PC)\n\nIndivisible (PC, PS4)\n\nSpace Robinson (PC)\n\nActive Soccer 2019 (XBO)\n\nA Knight's Quest (XBO)\n\nSTELLATUM (XBO, Switch)\n\nAsphalt Legends 9 (Switch)\n\nReventure (Switch)\n\nOooft. That's a meaty list. Let's get onto the trailers, starting with Trine 4 which has gracefully gone back to its 2D puzzling roots.\n\nMan, Indivisible looks really, really good. But there's a ton of games to absorb this week, and it's not like we weren't busy enough with PAX Australia at the backend (or the industry part of Melbourne International Games Week, which I'm at right now). Plenty to say about John Wick Hex too, although the embargo has to lift on that one first.\n\nSee anything you like?", "description": "If you wanted to turn John Wick into a video game, how would you do it?", "authors": ["Kotaku Australia", "Alex Walker"], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/k/2019/10/john-wick-hex-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
