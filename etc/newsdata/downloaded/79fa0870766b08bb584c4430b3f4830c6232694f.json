It's a waste problem that runs counter to what the industry is held up to be: a perfect solution for environmentalists looking to combat climate change, an attractive investment for companies such as Budweiser and Hormel Foods, and a job creator across the Midwest and Great Plains.\n\nAt the end of a long gravel road on the southwest Nebraska prairie, the state's first wind farm, Kimball Wind Project, is caught in the breeze. But the turbine scrap area looks more like a sci-fi drama set. Rob Van Vleet climbed atop a 127-foot-long turbine blade, and walked the length like a plank.\n\nEnergy In Wyoming, Wind Power Is On The Rise Where Coal Is King In Wyoming, Wind Power Is On The Rise Where Coal Is King Listen \u00b7 4:37 4:37\n\n\"These towers may be supporting as much as 150,000 pounds, 250 feet in the air,\" Van Vleet said. \"The stands are an inch and a half thick steel ... so they're very strong.\"\n\nNinety percent of a turbine's parts can be recycled or sold, according to Van Vleet, but the blades, made of a tough but pliable mix of resin and fiberglass \u2014 similar to what spaceship parts are made from \u2014 are a different story.\n\n\"The blades are kind of a dud because they have no value,\" he said.\n\nDecommissioned blades are also notoriously difficult and expensive to transport. They can be anywhere from 100 to 300 feet long, and need to be cut up onsite before getting trucked away on specialized equipment \u2014 which costs money \u2014 to the landfill.\n\nOnce there, Van Vleet said, the size of the blades can put landfills in a tough spot.\n\n\"If you're small utility or municipality and all of a sudden hundreds of blades start coming to your landfill, you don't want to use up your capacity for your local municipal trash for wind turbine blades,\" he said, adding that permits for more landfill space adds another layer of expenses.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Christina Stella/Harvest Public Media Christina Stella/Harvest Public Media\n\nCindy Langstrom manages the turbine blade disposal project for the municipal landfill in Casper, Wyo. Though her landfill is one of the only ones in the state \u2014 not to mention the entire U.S. \u2014 with enough space to take wind farm waste, she said the blades' durability initially posed a financial hurdle.\n\n\"Our crushing equipment is not big enough to crush them,\" she said.\n\nLangstrom's team eventually settled on cutting up the blades into three pieces and stuffing the two smaller sections into the third, which was cheaper than renting stronger crushing machines that are usually made for mining.\n\nKarl Englund, a researcher and chief technology officer of Global Fiberglass Solutions, said recycling turbine blades is more regulated in countries that have had wind power for decades. The European Union has waste management rules, so some European companies sell older parts to customers in Asian and Latin American countries.\n\n\"[In Europe], land is at a premium, and you're not allowed to throw things away,\" he said. \"So you have to do it.\"\n\nEnglund believes he's found a way to recycle blades by stripping the blades of their resin and then grinding them up to make chocolate chip-sized pellets. They can be used for decking materials, pallets and piping. His startup opened its first processing facility in central Texas this year, and are leasing a second space near Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nVan Vleet said finding better ways to decommission wind farms will be an uphill battle, but when it comes to confronting the looming waste issue, \"it's something that's happening, whether we like it or not, so we just as well get in on it.\"\n\nHe's exploring his own way to decrease the industry's landfill footprint, in the hopes that blade recycling can blossom into a local industry. And for rural areas looking for an economic boost, Van Vleet thinks his risk of recycling just might pay off.\n\n\"Out on the prairie, there's not very much scrap,\" he said. \"The idea is to develop the next technology, otherwise, I wouldn't be doing this.\n\n\"We lose money on every blade we haul.\"", "description": "While wind energy is marketed as the future's green energy solution, turbines only last about 20 years, and disposing of their behemoth fiberglass blades is both complicated and costly.", "authors": ["Christina Stella"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/10/image_1-edit_wide-2fb70c8e1404c44a7c230d7ca4087ea42deb68d2.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
