There is nothing normal about kids being shot, being hunted in their school.\"\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.", "description": "The parents of children killed at Sandy Hook have put out a graphic video about mass shootings.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/15E24/production/_108863698_sandybrighter.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
