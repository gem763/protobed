They say arbitration is a more fair and efficient process.\n\nThe bill passed with mostly Democrats backing the measure. It\u2019s the first time the bill has passed the House, according to one expert. Passage in the Republican-controlled Senate could be difficult, observers say.\n\nThe bill would stop companies from forcing their customers or employees to sign agreements that say private arbitrators, instead of judges, must handle any disputes that arise between them.\n\nThe agreements are ubiquitous. Consider this: There were 327 million people living in America last July, according to U.S. Census numbers. There were at least 826.5 million consumer arbitration agreements in force during that same time, according to one researcher.\n\nLikewise, 80 of the Fortune 100 companies have used arbitration since 2010 for work-related disputes, according to the same researcher, Imre Stephen Szalai, a professor at the Loyola University New Orleans College of Law.\n\nFederal arbitration rules have ballooned to cover a wide swath of customer and employee conflicts since lawmakers enacted the law in 1925, Szalai said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Consumers won\u2019t be allowed to sue over alleged bedbugs in Wayfair headboard\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with the idea of arbitration, according to Szalai. But procedures now written into many of the agreements \u2014 like consumer filing deadlines and requirements to travel to specified locations\u2014 put consumers at a disadvantage, he said.\n\n\u201cOur rights are meaningless if we\u2019re not allowed to access the courts.\u201d\n\nHere are three ways arbitrations can touch people\u2019s lives:\n\nCell phones\n\nJust about every fight over a cell phone might end up before an arbitrator. 88% of mobile wireless contracts included mandatory arbitration rules, according to a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau study in 2015. Fights over defective phones, allegedly unfair fees and \u201cthrottling\u201d \u2014 claims of slowed connection speeds \u2014 are the sorts of things arbitration can cover, Szalai said.\n\nBanking and credit cards\n\nIn retail banking and credit cards, fights over late charge calculations, alleged deceptive practices and fallout from data breaches are some of the disputes covered in retail financial service arbitrations, according to Szalai. The same CFPB study said while 16% of credit card issuers have arbitration agreements, they hold half of the outstanding credit card debt.\n\nEarlier this year, Chase JPM, +0.35% announced it was re-including forced arbitration clauses into popular credit cards like its Slate, United MileagePlus UAL, +1.03% and Slate cards. A Chase spokeswoman previously told MarketWatch that arbitration \u201c\u201cis often faster, less expensive and provides better outcomes for our customers.\u201d\n\nJobs\n\nIn five years, almost 83% country\u2019s private, non-unionized workers, will be subject to mandatory arbitration, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. That will be a rise from the 56% in 2017, it said.\n\nArbitration clauses can handle accusations of workplace wage theft, prejudice and sexual harassment, Szalai noted.\n\nThe #MeToo movement put a harsh light on arbitration, saying the practice silenced sexual harassment victims. For example, Google GOOG, -0.29% drew fire for using mandatory arbitration in sexual harassment cases. It ended mandatory employee arbitration altogether in March.\n\nSome state lawmakers have passed laws to address arbitration and workplace sexual harassment. New York politicians passed a law last year saying companies can\u2019t use arbitration to handle sexual harassment allegations. In June, a Manhattan federal judge said federal laws, which didn\u2019t have rules on harassment claims, took precedence. The case is being appealed.\n\nSzalai said the #MeToo movement was one reason why the FAIR act passed now. \u201cYou can see in wake of #MeToo, a great awareness of the harms of these clauses,\u201d he said.\n\nSzalai doubts the bill would pass, at least in its current form, in the Republican-controlled Senate. With court rulings backing arbitration\u2019s use, he said, \u201cif you represent a company, it\u2019s probably malpractice not to recommend arbitration, because it can get rid of a class action [lawsuit] in a heartbeat.\u201d", "description": "There are more than twice as many arbitration agreements as there are people in America, by one count.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR896_hank_j_ZG_20190923144659.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
