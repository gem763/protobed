Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\n\u201cThis may be a strategy to set the people against the establishment. I would like to gently suggest he is the establishment and we are still people\u2026 Please, please will he going forward moderate his language so we will all feel secure when we are going about our jobs.\u201d\n\nDescribing Mr Johnson as \u201ca dangerous prime minister who thinks he is above the law, but in truth is not fit for the office he holds\u201d, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told MPs: \u201cAfter yesterday\u2019s ruling, he should have done the honourable thing and resigned.\n\n\u201cYet here he is, forced back to this house to rightfully face scrutiny, without a shred of remorse or humility and no substance whatsoever.\u201d\n\nThe Labour leader accused Mr Johnson of making \u201cminimal\u201d efforts to secure a revised withdrawal agreement and called on him to release papers setting out details of any offer he has made to Brussels to keep the Irish border open after Brexit.\n\nBut the PM taunted Labour for \u201crunning away\u201d from an election under Mr Corbyn\u2019s leadership because it was \u201cnot only terrified that he might lose but even more terrified by the remote possibility that he might win\u201d. Labour \u201cdither\u201d was preventing the government from pressing ahead with plans to increase NHS funding and fight knife crime, he claimed.\n\nClaiming that Mr Corbyn had been blocked from going for an election by colleagues including shadow chancellor John McDonnell, he said: \u201cHe is being held captive by his colleagues, the electorate are being held captive by this zombie parliament and zombie opposition, and he wants the whole country to be held captive in the EU,\u201d said Mr Johnson.\n\nBut Mr Corbyn made clear he would not budge from his position that he will not trigger an election until no-deal Brexit has been definitively ruled out, telling the PM: \u201cIf he wants an election, get an extension and let\u2019s have an election.\u201d\n\nDespite the crushing verdict of the Supreme Court on Tuesday, which found that the prorogation order which he advised the Queen to issue was \u201cunlawful, void and of no effect\u201d, Mr Johnson insisted he had followed exactly the same process as previous prime ministers in preparing for a new parliamentary session.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely no disrespect to the judiciary to say I think the court was wrong to pronounce on what is essentially a political question at a time of great national controversy,\u201d he said.\n\nHis defiance of the court prompted a horrified response from a string of MPs.\n\nIndependent Sylvia Hermon told the Commons: \u201cI was shocked that he, as prime minister, should take it upon himself with his arrogance to declare the judgement of the Supreme Court wrong.\u201d\n\nPlaid Cymru\u2019s Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts called for his impeachment for misleading the public.\n\nAnd Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson told him: \u201cEven my five-year-old knows that if you do something wrong, you have to say sorry.\n\n\u201cIf my son can apologise for kicking a football indoors, surely the prime minister can have the humility to say sorry for misleading the Queen, misleading the country and illegally shutting down democracy.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson faces a blizzard of opposition efforts in the coming days to block his \u201cdo or die\u201d plans to take Britain out of the EU with or without a deal on 31 October.\n\nLiberal Democrats have begun talks with other parties on potential measures to force Mr Johnson to request an extension to Article 50 talks as early as next week.\n\nAnd opposition MPs may again seek to seize control of parliamentary proceedings to ensure that preventing a no deal is \u201cwatertight\u201d, to force the release of the legal advice behind the prorogation, or to gain access to documentation setting out his plans for the Irish border.\n\nThe government will on Thursday seek to close down parliament again for a short recess to allow the Conservative annual conference to go ahead as planned in Manchester next week.\n\nBut the bid is likely to be voted down by opposition MPs, forcing hasty revisions to the agenda for the gathering, where Mr Johnson is currently scheduled to deliver his keynote speech on the same day he will have to face Prime Minister\u2019s Questions at Westminster.", "description": "Boris Johnson was welcomed back to the parliament he tried to shut down as a returning hero by Conservative MPs who loudly applauded his attempts to brazen out his humiliation at the hands of the Supreme Court.
