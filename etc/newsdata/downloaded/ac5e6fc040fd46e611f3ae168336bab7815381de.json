Sterling was the worst performer among major currencies as Johnson confirmed an earlier BBC report, while U.K. government bonds rallied on expectations of an earlier Bank of England interest-rate cut. With the U.K. set to leave the European Union on Oct. 31, suspending Parliament would mean less time for lawmakers to attempt to block a no-deal.
