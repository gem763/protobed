What we have seen Santiago indicates that there is something else. It\u2019s not just about students evading the subway, it\u2019s a much bigger problem. But violence is not the way that Jesus proposes and we cannot support it.\n\nOn Sunday evening, Chilean President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era gave a televised address to announce he had scrapped plans to raise the cost of subway fairs. He also launched an attack on the rioters, declaring that the country was at \u201cwar with a powerful and uncompromising enemy that respects nothing and no one.\u201d\n\nThe National Council of Evangelical Churches of Chile (CONIEV) came out in support of Pi\u00f1era, declaring \u201call our support\u201d to his efforts to restore calm and accusing those behind the violence of being \u201cservants of darkness.\u201d\n\n\u201cPublic order is God\u2019s perfect will for society, and at this time it is up to support the armed forces and the police, who are constitutionally responsible for maintaining it,\u201d the organization said in a statement.\n\nThe unrest is the worst the country has seen since the final weeks of Augusto Pinochet\u2019s military junta in 1989.\n\nChile declared a state of emergency after protests over a tax on subways grew to include anger over living costs and inequality. Security forces fired tear gas and arrested 1,400+ people. At least 11 people have died, and schools and shops are closed. pic.twitter.com/GVXigtBC1u \u2014 AJ+ (@ajplus) October 21, 2019\n\nThe organization Christians for Christ and for Chile urged their followers to partake in direct action by going out to the streets \u201cto help collect the rubble and clean the subway stations.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn hours, the country was transformed into a state of chaos and it is important that the church must be prepared and have a contingent of people willing to contribute not just in ways beyond spirituality,\u201d they said.\n\nSeveral Evangelical leaders have also convened a prayer movement from the \u201cChile, we pray for you\u201d platform, which has organized calls to pray from home daily. \u201cThis is the time to pray together for our nation,\u201d they explained.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Religious leaders in Chile called people to pray for the end of left-wing riots taking place across the country on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/chile-riots-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
