[sic]\u2019 Daley remarked on Facebook. \u2018Good job to conservation for keeping our town safe! This little guy has been tranquilized and sent to Polar Bear Jail.\u2019\n\nThe bear has been taken to a holding facility, in accordance with protocol, and will eventually be relocated 40 kilometers north of Churchill via helicopter.\n\nBob Windsor, one of the two conservation officers shown in the video, said it\u2019s rare to see a polar bear in residential areas during the day.\n\nHe said it\u2019s been a slow bear season in the town but described Wednesday\u2019s encounter as \u2018a little hectic for a while\u2019.\n\n\u2018We got a call that there was a bear right in town, which is kind of unusual,\u2019 Windsor told CBC. \u2018Usually the bears that get into town are at night time. It's fairly rare that we do get them in the day time, because they're usually seen prior to getting into town.\u2019\n\nThe adolescent creature was spotted by shocked Churchill, Manitoba by resident Danielle Daley, who looked up out the window from her desk on October 9 to see the white bear giving two conservation officers the run around\n\nDaley watched on in disbelief as the officers gave the bear chase, before they were eventually able to successfully drug the 200 pounder and capturing it after 15 minutes. The bear has been taken to a holding facility, in accordance with protocol, and will eventually be relocated 40 kilometres north of Churchill via helicopter\n\nHe added that he and the other officer had difficulty cornering the bear because, though the diamond is fenced off, it has a number of gateways around the perimeter that the bear could escape through.\n\nThe rare encounter also attracted a large crowd who came out to watch the bear, forcing officers to make quick decisions in the interest of public safety.\n\n\u2018In a situation like this, where there are people around, it can be dangerous,\u2019 Windsor said. \u2018You don't want to push the bear to where there's people, so the decision was made to dart the bear. That would be the safest thing to do.\u2019\n\nBears in Churchill are waiting for the summer ice to come in on Hudson's Bay to hunt for seal, and the town lies between the bears' summer dens and the bay.\n\n\u2018Our top priority is the safety of people, that's the first priority that we have with the polar bear alert program. The second priority is the safety of the bear. That ranks right up there also,\u2019 Windsor clarified.", "description": "The bear was spotted in Churchill, Manitoba by shocked resident Danielle Daley, who looked up out the window from her desk\u00a0on October 9 to see the white bear running from conservation officers.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/21/19708274-0-image-a-5_1571083933747.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
