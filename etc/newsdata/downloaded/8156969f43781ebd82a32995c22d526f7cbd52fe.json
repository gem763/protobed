Julien Warnard/Pool via REUTER\n\nThe murder of investigative reporter Jan Kuciak, who uncovered fraud cases involving politically connected businessmen, and his fiancee Martina Kusnirova shone a spotlight on corruption in the central European country, sparking the biggest protests since the end of communism in 1989 that shook the political scene.\n\nFive people have been charged with the killings and are awaiting trial, including high-profile businessman Marian Kocner, whose business deals were a subject of Kuciak\u2019s stories.\n\nAny contacts with Kocner, an acquaintance of politicians from various parties, have become toxic in the light of the charges.\n\nSpecial prosecutors said last month they had been able to extract tens of thousands messages from Kocner\u2019s phone, including communications with \u201crepresentatives of state bodies and the justice system\u201d.\n\nSlovak media published parts of messages Kocner allegedly exchanged with a woman also charged in the killing and with his business allies, in which they discuss his alleged contacts among the authorities.\n\nZlatica Kusnirova, mother of Kuciak\u2019s fiancee, and her lawyer Roman Kvasnica have confirmed the authenticity of leaked messages. Kocner\u2019s lawyer did not respond to emailed questions.\n\nTwo deputy general prosecutors have been forced to resign since January over their contacts with either Kocner or the charged woman.\n\nA deputy justice minister resigned earlier this month after her mobile phone was seized by the police, but she denied any contacts with Kocner.\n\nPellegrini is not personally implicated in Kocner\u2019s messages but opposition parties called the no-confidence vote as he refused to remove the deputy justice minister until she was formally charged. They decided to go on with the vote even after her resignation despite lacking the numbers in the 150-member chamber to defeat the prime minister.\n\nThe government will face more pressure on Friday when protesters return to the streets, aiming to \u201csupport courageous prosecutors and police officers and call for a trustworthy government\u201d, ahead of the February general election.\n\nRuling Smer is still the strongest party, with around 20 percent in polls thanks to welfare spending and a strong economy. But it has suffered major loses in regional, local, presidential and EU elections in the past 18 months, and a new pro-EU/liberal coalition is catching up in the polls with around 15-percent support.", "description": "Slovak Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini should easily defeat a no-confidence vote on Tuesday, but his government is being increasingly damaged by revelations about the reach of the main suspect in the 2018 murder of a journalist into state offices.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430625564&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F1SO", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
