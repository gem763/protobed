REUTERS/Yuya Shino/File Photo\n\nThe final Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) edged down to a seasonally adjusted 49.3 from 49.4 in July, and also off a preliminary 49.5.\n\nThe index stayed below the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction for a fourth month, marking the longest run of shrinkage since a six-month stretch from March to August 2016.\n\n\u201cJapanese goods producers continued to signal difficult conditions during August,\u201d said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.\n\n\u201cThe sector was plagued by production cutbacks and flagging demand, which have been the trends so far in 2019. Softer growth across Asia, particularly in China, was reported to have dented export opportunities.\u201d\n\nOutput and total new orders continued to decline.\n\nWhile an index of new export orders rose to the highest since March, it remained in contraction for the ninth month, the longest such run since an 11-month spell from April 2012 to February 2013.\n\nManufacturers reported the end of a construction spike ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games and a scheduled sales tax hike in October are expected to adversely impact output volumes the coming months.\n\nCompanies cut prices of their goods for a third straight month, citing client requests for discounts and weak market conditions.\n\nMore positive news came from Japan\u2019s factory output, with data on Friday showing production bounced more than expected in July, though it was expected to fall again next month, signaling further strains ahead.\n\nIn another bright spot, the final reading for backlogs of work rose to its highest since December last year, though it still showed a decline and some firms said operating capacity eased as a result of slower inflows of new business.\n\n\u201cWith external and domestic headwinds aplenty, it is difficult to envisage any near-term improvements in Japan\u2019s manufacturing sector,\u201d IHS Markit\u2019s Hayes said.", "description": "Japanese manufacturing activity declined for a fourth straight month in August amid flagging demand, a revised business survey showed on Monday, underlining a darkening outlook for the world's third-largest economy.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425222026&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8100L"}
