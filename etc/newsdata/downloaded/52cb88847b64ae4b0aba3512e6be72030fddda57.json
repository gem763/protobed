Turki al-Maliki said during a press briefing in Riyadh.\n\nThe briefing focused on projectile debris laid out on tables as well as aerial and close-up photos of Aramco's damaged facilities.\n\nAl-Maliki said the drones used in the attacks \u2014 which had been claimed by Yemen's Houthi rebels \u2014 were Iranian delta-wing unmanned aerial vehicles, and that they came from the north to the south. He then rolled surveillance camera footage of what he said was a drone's approach to the Abqaiq oil facility.\n\nNBC News has not verified the Saudi claims that the items displayed are remnants from Saturday's strike.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the defense ministry, al-Maliki pointed to Shiite-dominated Iran \u2014 a longtime adversary of the Sunni monarchy \u2014 and \"the destabilizing role Iran and its proxies play in the region.\"\n\nAsked directly and repeatedly by a reporter whether the attacker was Iran, al-Maliki didn't answer, saying only, \"I am controlling the conference,\" before moving onto another question.\n\nResponding to another reporter on the topic of how Saudi Arabia would respond to the attacks, the spokesman said, \"We are just a military tool. ... That is a decision for the political authorities.\"", "description": "But the Saudi spokesman stops short of saying Iran launched the attack.", "authors": ["Natasha Turak"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106136501-15688213791912019-09-18t153006z_595575233_rc1b82990500_rtrmadp_3_saudi-aramco-defence.jpg?v=1568821457", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
