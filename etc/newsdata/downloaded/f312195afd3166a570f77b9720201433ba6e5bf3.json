The newly embattled founder and CEO of the We Company, parent entity of WeWork, is reportedly fending off a coup from the adults in the room.\n\nUnfortunately for Neumann, the grown-ups showered his company with more than $10 billion\u2014and now they\u2019d like to secure their investment against the notably odd, famously self-enriching chief executive.\n\nSoftbank, American tech\u2019s deepest-pocketed foreign financier, owns about 29 percent of the We Company, which encompasses WeWork and its sister brands. That includes the company's residential real estate arm WeLive and WeGrow, an alternative schooling program that charges $38,000 for a 4-year-old to do yoga asanas in a designer Chelsea classroom.\n\nIn 2017, Softbank famously launched an unprecedentedly huge $100 billion pool of venture capital called the Vision Fund. By pumping money into the We Company, the Japanese corporate mega-conglomerate helped power the company\u2019s fairly incomprehensible $47 billion private valuation\u2014a number that\u2019s since sunk to a more Earth-bound $10 billion as Neumann and company navigate emerging palace intrigues, leading to a tabling of the IPO in the meantime.\n\nNow, the The Wall Street Journal and a handful of other outlets have reported that board members with Softbank loyalties are poised to move against Neumann. Reuters reports that Benchmark Capital is also in on the plan, and Team Neumann and Team Big Money are set to have it out this week. Reportedly, no agreements have been reached. WeWork declined to comment, telling The Daily Beast that the company is in a pre-IPO \u201cquiet period.\u201d Softbank did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nFALL FROM GRACE\n\nStories about Neumann and his wife, Rebekah Paltrow Neumann\u2014cousin of Goop goddess Gwyneth Paltrow\u2014have included myriad bizarre anecdotes in recent weeks: he stuffed weed in a cereal box on a private international flight; she fired a cluster of employees she\u2019d just met because she \u201cdidn\u2019t like their energy\u201d (so much for the warm, fuzzy feelings). Add that to some business maneuvers that have prompted broad accusations of self-dealing, and an erratic picture emerges.\n\nEven among companies defined by their CEOs, Neumann's stranglehold on his company and its culture comes off as extreme.\n\nIn August, the company\u2019s financial filings revealed a corporate structure explicitly designed to keep power concentrated with Neumann and his wife, who is credited as the We Company\u2019s chief brand and impact officer and a WeWork co-founder. The prospectus controversially detailed how control of the company would default to her in the event anything happened to Neumann and that she would be empowered to appoint a successor.\n\nIn a September amendment to WeWork\u2019s S1 filing, Rebekah Paltrow Neumann appears to have been stripped of that responsibility. \u201cNo member of Adam\u2019s family will sit on our board,\u201d the amendment states.\n\nInvestor-friendly tweaks designed to rein in the chief executive\u2019s power also saw Neumann\u2019s special class of shares toned down, though they still carry extra votes\u2014votes he could use to purge the entire board, in the event of a failed or flailing corporate ouster.\n\nICARUS COMPLEX\n\nNeumann\u2019s precarious position is a cautionary tale for the tech industry, where cults of personality \u00e0 la Steve Jobs-era Apple once reigned. Recent years have illustrated how a company synonymous with its problematic chief executive can devolve into a corporate Superfund site\u2014a mess investors and new leadership are tasked with cleaning up. Former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick is widely regarded as the seed of the ridesharing giant's many misdeeds, now the topic of a bestseller. And no one will soon forget Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos, in spite of the company\u2019s quite forgettable science.\n\nWeWork shouldn\u2019t be an interesting company, but Neumann\u2019s exploits are elevating it into rarefied, risky air. Its core business\u2014subleasing office space\u2014is almost shockingly mundane, but Neumann\u2019s inflated corporate jargon paints a grand, if ambiguous picture\u2014one not without culty overtones. (The We Company\u2019s mission statement? To \u201celevate the world\u2019s consciousness\u201d\u2014corporate shorthand for ideological negative space.)\n\nWhether or not you agree that WeWork is a tech company (is it enough to take money earmarked for tech companies?) the sector has historically celebrated a degree of \u201ceccentricity\u201d from leaders that might not fly in the traditional business world. Neumann is just the latest in a storied tradition for an industry only beginning to come to terms with its heroes and their at times less than heroic deeds.\n\nNeumann\u2019s fate aside, investors seem to be getting wiser to the smoke and mirrors of singular \u201cgeniuses\u201d within tech, seeing the phenomenon for what it usually is: strong branding coupled with aggressive business practices built from the ground up. To investors, this kind of corporate metonymy can be worryingly emblematic of a founder\u2019s vise-like grip on a company\u2014a liability, if not tempered by less lofty minds.\n\nSoftbank\u2019s coup isn\u2019t a sure thing, but it\u2019s still an ugly crack in Neumann\u2019s veneer\u2014and a signal he won\u2019t be able to supercharge his company with massive wads of venture capital without some accountability.\n\nIn the broader tech industry, the halcyon consequence-free heydays are drawing to an end in the face of an onslaught of regulation and bad press. If investors have their way, the party might be over for WeWork soon too.", "description": "A week after tabling its IPO, WeWork\u2019s chief executive is facing an investor uprising over allegations of self-dealing and toking up at 30,000 feet.", "authors": ["Taylor Hatmaker", "Senior Technology Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569288421/190923-hatmaker-wework-tease_zj5akl", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
