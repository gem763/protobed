Christian has been doing it from the bench, fully deserved his start and it was a fantastic match-winning performance. I know what a good player he is.\u201d", "description": "Christian Pulisic\u2019s perfect hat-trick suggested Chelsea\u2019s \u00a358 million American international is a man in a hurry at Turf Moor on Saturday night in a team performance that also hinted that Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea revolution is gaining unstoppable momentum.", "authors": ["Mike Whalley", "Jj Bull", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/26/TELEMMGLPICT000214232076-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqC_LLCXkS_z-CZqgOMP7Bey6NLFRCnp8jC6l5H1gpWZE.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
