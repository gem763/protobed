The practice will end on October 26th \u2013 a date chosen deliberately to coincide with the anniversary of Uluru\u2019s handback to its traditional owners. With school holidays and the long weekend currently going on, the sacred site has seen a gargantuan swell in numbers of goons trying to scramble up the site before they can\u2019t anymore.\n\nOver the weekend, The Australian dedicated its front page to a fairly remarkable image: Uluru, practically choked with tourists, snaking their way up the walking path in scenes vaguely reminiscent of the human traffic jams on Everest. Bafflingly enough, the paper referred to the crowds as \u201cpilgrims,\u201d as if they had some sort of inalienable, God-given right to be there.\n\nPink flesh against red rock as thousands of white people flock to climb #Uluru, oblivious to the pleas of Indigenous Australians not to do so. pic.twitter.com/CsMaLDU1Dl \u2014 Dana McCauley (@Dana_Adele) October 5, 2019\n\nThe subsequent article \u2013 an even-handed depiction of the utter chaos currently befalling the site, despite the fucking ridiculous headline The Australian bosses subsequently slapped on it \u2013 describes how on at least two occasions over the past week, crowds attempting to climb Uluru have exceeded 1,000 in number. One man, a retiree from Newcastle, doggedly stated \u201cI\u2019m not leaving until I climb it.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE Culture Warrior Pauline Hanson Backflips On Uluru Stance After Getting Scared Climbing It\n\nThere\u2019s a handful of common attitudes among those who are determined to get to the top before October 26th: Wilful obliviousness, egregious nose-thumbing, and caustic parroting of justifications issued by those who do know better, but couldn\u2019t give a shit.\n\nThe backlash to the photo and the front page on social media has been swift, loud, and unanimous.\n\nLet\u2019s not pull any punches this was purely a symbolic act of white nationalism designed to convey a racist message of white superiority over Indigenous Australians. We have to face up to the fact that many white Australians are inherently racist. https://t.co/2iS56ZYsYs \u2014 michael Olson (@michael03771434) October 6, 2019\n\nHeadline fix: Want to be a cultural asshole?

I honestly can\u2019t believe people can STILL be so ignorant ???? (this was in Toowoomba) \u2014 Madeline Hayman-Reber (@MadelineHayman) October 6, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty simple equation, really: The Anangu people have, for decades, respectfully urged tourists to consider not climbing Uluru. They believe strongly that if lines of tourists 1,000 deep had been foreseen, previous elders would\u2019ve never agreed to allow climbing in the first place.\n\nThe site does hold significant cultural worth for its traditional owners, but beyond that they feel a massive responsibility for the people who cross into their land. More specifically, the Anangu people feel intense sorrow and grief for those who pass away while on their land, which includes while climbing Uluru. Since climbing began only a handful of decades ago, at least 35 tourists have died on Uluru. Therefore, the climb is ceasing.\n\nOctober 26th is the final stage of a slow phasing out. It\u2019s not a fucking deadline.\n\nStop.", "description": "Thousands of Australian are rushing to climb Uluru before it becomes banned on October 26.
