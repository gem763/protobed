Yet, with Trump\u2019s approval, they directed actions and criticized operations without any oversight. They wasted valuable staff time in hundreds of pages of communications and meetings, emails show. ProPublica last year obtained hundreds of pages of communications mostly from the three men. The CREW emails reveal disdainful attitudes within the department to the trio\u2019s meddling.\n\nThe three men were particularly interested in a $16 billion technology contract for veterans hospitals and were instrumental in significantly delaying it, according to Politico. According to one email obtained by CREW, Moskowitz insisted on being included in \u201cevery call\u201d involving VA contracts.\n\nOne department physician asked by a VA official to respond to questions from one of the triumvirate called the queries \u201cjust ridiculous. They don\u2019t make any sense and there is a complete lack of understanding ... I\u2019m just baffled,\u201d the email stated.\n\nThis is an outrage. VA staff are being forced to answer to Mar-a-Lago customers. https://t.co/j91vgtiXFb pic.twitter.com/IbPD7u5V00 \u2014 Citizens for Ethics (@CREWcrew) August 30, 2019\n\nSupervisors passed along demands to answer complex questions or follow instructions with the explanation that it came from a Trump associate \u2014 and that responses would have to be handled \u201csensitively and with facts.\u201d\n\nOne staffer said he considered a meeting with two of the men a \u201cgrin and bear it session.\u201d Another dismissed one of the trio as \u201cjust way out of his depth.\u201d\n\nOne member of the department complained that time was being wasted with Sherman by talking \u201cpast each other,\u201d adding: \u201cGiven Marc doesn\u2019t understand the context of government nor does he understand the contract.\u201d\n\nAnother complained of Sherman: \u201cNot sure where Mr. Sherman is going with his comments but our language in the contract is consistent with the requirements of our clinicians [and] various external reviews.\u201d\n\nStaff members appeared confused in emails about the men\u2019s authority in the department. \u201cBruce Moskowitz will join the call tomorrow,\u201d read one email. \u201cHe is a White House adviser. I don\u2019t know much about him other than he is important.\u201d\n\nOne quipped about a forwarded request: \u201cYou will love this one.\u201d\n\nDavid Shulkin, who was Veterans Affairs secretary at the time, was fired last year after he repeatedly complained about the men, Politico reported. \u201cShulkin would say, \u2018Who the hell is this person who practices medicine in Florida and has never run a health care system?\u2019\u201d a source told Politico.\n\nCREW noted that the \u201cinfluence of the so-called \u2018Mar-a-Lago guys\u2019 over VA department affairs raises serious ethical red flags for a number of reasons,\u201d including opportunities to profit from their involvement.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the men remain involved in VA operations.\n\nThey told ProPublica in a joint statement last year that their \u201cadvice\u201d to the VA could be accepted or not.\n\n\u201cAt all times, we offered our help and advice on a voluntary basis, seeking nothing at all in return,\u201d they said in the statement. \u201cWhile we were always willing to share our thoughts, we did not make or implement any type of policy, possess any authority over agency decisions, or direct government officials to take any actions.\u201d", "description": "\"The questions are just ridiculous,\" one VA physician complained about the three men's interference.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d69c13a3b00004900cabe78.jpeg?cache=z9v4g2ocw3&ops=1778_1000"}
