One is a motorbike with a rider and pillion passenger; the other is a silver Ford Kuga with a number of occupants.\n\n(Image: MPS)\n\n\u201cBoth these vehicles were in Woolwich Road at the time of the first altercation and then pursued Ethan into Armitage Road.\n\n\u201cI am keen to hear any information about these two vehicles so we can trace those who used them on the night of the murder.\u201d\n\nPolice arrested a 26-year-old man in Hertfordshire on suspicion of murder in November last year.\n\nHe has been released under investigation.\n\nDCI Leonard continued: \u201cWhatever the motive in this case, Ethan did not deserve to be pursued and attacked in this shocking manner.\n\n(Image: MPS)\n\n\u201cI believe the answer to who is responsible for this attack lies within the local community and I would urge anyone with information to come forward and speak to my team, or if you are apprehensive about speaking to officers, then through the independent charity Crimestoppers.\n\n\u201cEthan\u2019s death has left his family utterly devastated and they can only begin the healing process once those responsible have been convicted.\u201d\n\nEthan's grieving mother has also made an emotional appeal for information to catch her only son's killers.\n\nShe said: \u201cThis atrocity has had such a devastating impact on his father and I, his siblings, the extended family, friends and the community as a whole.\n\n(Image: MPS)\n\n\u201cI urge members of the public, bystanders, witnesses and the community to come forward with any information that you may have that can help this investigation.\n\n\u201cOur hearts are completely broken. Lives have been shattered never to be repaired.\n\n\"Finding the murderers will not bring Ethan back, but it will help to give the family closure that we so deserve.\n\n\u201cWe have to put a stop to people thinking they can literally get away with murder.\n\n(Image: MPS)\n\n\"Please! As a mother I have lost my only son...I urge you to help us in this time.\n\n\"This violence has to stop.\u201d\n\nAnyone with information should call the incident room on 0208 721 4622 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.", "description": "Ethan Nedd-Bruce, 18, had just left a chicken shop in Greenwich, south east London, when he attacked, chased and gunned down on October 22 last year", "authors": ["Lorraine King", "Image", "Mps"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20670454.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_One-year-on-from-the-brutal-murder-of-a-teenager-in-Greenwich-detectives-are-releasing-images-and-f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
