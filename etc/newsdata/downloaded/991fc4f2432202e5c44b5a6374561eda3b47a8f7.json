Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) at a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing on Capitol Hill, July 18, 2019. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\nRepresentative Rashida Tlaib (D., Mich.) suggested this week at a town hall that local Detroit law enforcement officers could detain White House officials who refuse to comply with subpoenas issued by Democrats, quipping that, \u201cwe won\u2019t hurt them.\u201d\n\nThe freshman Democrat nodded in agreement with a town hall attendee who suggested U.S. Marshals \u201chunt down\u201d White House officials if they \u201crefuse to leave power.\u201d\n\nTlaib responded that the current situation is \u201cunprecedented\u201d and said Democratic lawmakers have discussed what the correct process might be to arrest non-compliant White House officials.\n\n\u201cThis is the last caucus conversation we had. Do you know this is really unprecedented?\u201d Tlaib said. \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve ever had a situation like this. So they\u2019re trying to figure out \u2013 no joke \u2013 they\u2019re trying to figure out, well, is it the D.C. police that goes and gets them?\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats have subpoenaed several Trump administration officials for thousands of documents, some of which relate to the formal impeachment inquiry against the president. Last week, the House Foreign Affairs Committee subpoenaed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for documents involving the Trump administration\u2019s communications with Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWhere do we hold them? I\u2019m not in those kinds of conversations, but I\u2019m asking, like, you know, what happens?\u201d Tlaib said, adding that she has been told this is \u201cuncharted territory.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to be like, well where are we going to put them?\u201d the outspoken progressive continued. \u201cI\u2019m like you all. I ask the same questions. Well what happens when they don\u2019t comply? The fact of the matter is, we held Barr and Secretary Ross from commerce, the secretary of commerce, in contempt.\u201d\n\nIn July, the House voted to hold Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in criminal contempt of Congress for defying congressional subpoenas regarding the proposed citizenship question on the 2020 census.\n\n\u201cI will tell them they can hold all those people right here in Detroit,\u201d Tlaib said of the cabinet secretaries. \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of them and make sure they show up to the committee hearings. We won\u2019t hurt them.\u201d\n\nTlaib has called for Trump\u2019s impeachment since she began campaigning for Congress. She made headlines in November for promising during a speech to a crowd of supporters near Capitol Hill that, \u201cwe\u2019re gonna go in there and impeach the motherf\u2014er.'\u201d", "description": "Rashida Tlaib nodded in agreement with a town hall attendee who suggested U.S. Marshals \u201chunt down\u201d White House officials if they \"refuse to leave power.\"", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Andrew C.
