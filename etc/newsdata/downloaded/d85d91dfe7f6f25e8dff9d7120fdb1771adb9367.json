But his progress appears to have stalled.\n\nA 3-0 loss at Brighton & Hove Albion on Saturday left them off the pace in the Premier League and followed hot on the heels of a 7-2 Champions League drubbing by Bayern Munich and a League Cup exit to fourth-tier Colchester United.\n\nTottenham are playing in the Champions league group stages for a fourth successive season but there are suggestions Pochettino is under pressure to turn things around.\n\nWenger, however, leapt to the defence of his old adversary.\n\n\u201cI think he (Pochettino) has done very well, what everybody acknowledges,\u201d Wenger said in an interview with beIN Sport.\n\n\u201cWhen he came to Tottenham he slowly built them up with a very young generation. Every year people want something more from you. I experienced that at Arsenal.\n\n\u201cWe were 20 consecutive years in the top four but in the end it was not enough.\u201d\n\nWenger says Pochettino is almost paying for his own success and that the team is lacking the chemistry of previous seasons \u2014 a consequence of question marks over the futures of several players including Danish playmaker Christian Eriksen.\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019re four or five years, somewhere, no matter how good a job you have done, you have to show people you can give more, and he\u2019s at that stage,\u201d Wenger said.\n\n\u201cThey are a bit destabilised. When I played them two or three years ago they looked like a young, hungry team who had found good strength, good core of the team with people who were growing together, with people who expressed that hunger, and players from outside who were vital like Eriksen.\n\n\u201cToday you don\u2019t feel that exact same chemistry. A player like Eriksen is a bit sidelined because he doesn\u2019t look like he wants to commit to the future of the club.\u201d\n\nTottenham are ninth in the standings and have not won any of their last 10 away games. Despite reaching last season\u2019s Champions League final, their domestic form suffered a big dip and they lost 13 Premier League games last season.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve done extremely well in the Champions League and came close to winning it. It\u2019s down to small margins,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cYour real quality is always where you finish in the table. So the real trend is there.\n\n\u201cPochettino knows, he said himself something is not there at the moment. And he will certainly rebuild that. I like him very much because he\u2019s always been quiet, respectful, motivated, worked very well and got a lot of recognition from his own players, that means he\u2019s a quality manager.\u201d", "description": "Mauricio Pochettino has found an ally in former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger as he faces his toughest spell in his five years in charge of Tottenham Hotspur.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438109823&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF96120", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
