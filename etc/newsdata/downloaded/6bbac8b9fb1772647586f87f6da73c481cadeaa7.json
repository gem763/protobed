If successful, it could shift the power to create prominent matchups away from FIFA oversight and toward promoters and deep-pocketed club owners around the world. Currently, FIFA has the power to ban players who participate in unsanctioned matches.\n\nThe suit also targets Soccer United Marketing (SUM), the commercial arm of MLS. SUM pays U.S. Soccer a guaranteed annual fee\u2014about $26 million and $27 million respectively in 2017 and 2018, according to the federation\u2019s financial statements\u2014then sells certain broadcast rights and corporate sponsorships for MLS and the U.S. women\u2019s and men\u2019s national teams.\n\nRelevent alleges that the compact between SUM and U.S. Soccer has incentivized the federation to thwart Relevent\u2019s efforts to stage meaningful international soccer games in the U.S. Ross, the owner of Relevent Sports, also owns the Miami Dolphins.\n\nRelevent has organized several matches and tournaments between big-name clubs in recent years, such as a 2014 game between Manchester United and Real Madrid that drew more than 109,000 attendees to Michigan Stadium.\n\nBut those matches have been friendlies with no bearing on league standings or titles. U.S. Soccer has blocked Relevent\u2019s attempts to bring in-season matches to the U.S. that count in the standings and conspired with FIFA not to sanction such events, the suit alleges.\n\nSuch matchups are a threat because even exhibition games between well-known foreign clubs often outdraw those involving the U.S. men\u2019s national team and MLS, the suit says.\n\nRepresentatives from FIFA and MLS didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment. A U.S. Soccer spokesman reissued a statement in response to a similar suit, since withdrawn, that Relevent filed in state Supreme Court in New York in April.\n\nThe statement read in part: \u201cU.S. Soccer\u2019s process for approving international matches follows the FIFA statutes established to govern the game across the globe, which is required of all Federations and Confederations.\u201d\n\nRelevent CEO Daniel Sillman said in a statement that U.S. Soccer has been delinquent in its responsibility to promote the growth of soccer.\n\n\u201cFor decades the U.S. has shared its professional sports leagues with fans from all corners of the globe while the USSF has deprived our fans from seeing the highest level of soccer,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy? Because USSF is working with FIFA to shield SUM, who promotes its own games, from any competitive threat.\u201d\n\nThe suit also alleges that U.S. Soccer, FIFA and FIFA-affiliated governing bodies, leagues and clubs have agreed to shun players who participate in unsanctioned international games in the U.S. and threatened penalties against FIFA-affiliated leagues or clubs who participate in them.\n\nThe specter of sanctions from FIFA, and U.S. Soccer\u2019s power to sanction or deny sanction to international matches in the U.S., has created a monopoly to control the market for those games, the suit alleges.\n\nU.S. Soccer is recognized as soccer\u2019s national governing body under the federal Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act. But that authority doesn\u2019t include the power to regulate or sanction professional soccer matches, the suit alleges. Instead, U.S. Soccer claims that authority from FIFA, the suit says.\n\nIn October 2018, FIFA issued a policy prohibiting the staging of official season international matches outside the participant league\u2019s home country, according to the suit.\n\nFIFA, based in Switzerland, administers soccer world-wide through its statutes and regulations. But its rules \u201care privately derived, and do not have any governmental or statutory source of authority,\u201d the suit says.\n\nRelevent has tried to bring three matches to the U.S. in the past 12 months, the suit says\u2014two regular season and one postseason\u2014but was thwarted by U.S. Soccer\u2019s \u201cconspiracy with FIFA and others,\u201d according to the suit.\n\nRelevent Sports is owned by New York developer Stephen Ross.

Relevent approached U.S. Soccer about staging the match in Miami but was rebuffed, the suit says. The match was played in Spain.\n\nIn 2018 Relevent formed a partnership with Spain\u2019s top division, La Liga, to promote the league and bring in-season games to the U.S., the suit says. One reported plan was a January 2019 match between Girona and Barcelona at Hard Rock Stadium, home of the Dolphins. That event was blocked due to a conspiracy among U.S. Soccer, FIFA and others, the suit alleges.\n\nIn April 2019, U.S. Soccer denied Relevent\u2019s application to host a May 5, 2019, match in the U.S. between clubs in Ecuador\u2019s top division, citing FIFA\u2019s policy in prohibiting such events, according to the suit.\n\nJeffrey Kessler, a lead attorney for Relevent on the federal case, also is a lead lawyer in the U.S. women\u2019s team\u2019s pay-discrimination suit against U.S. Soccer. Mediation talks stalled last month and the case is set for a May 2020 trial.\n\n\u2014Joshua Robinson contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Rachel Bachman at rachel.bachman@wsj.com", "description": "A promotions company owned by New York developer Stephen Ross is suing the U.S. Soccer Federation for allegedly conspiring with FIFA and the commercial arm of Major League Soccer to block foreign-club matches from being held in the U.S.", "authors": ["Rachel Bachman", "Rachel.Bachman Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105385/social", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
