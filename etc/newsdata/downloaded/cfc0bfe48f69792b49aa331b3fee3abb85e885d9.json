Sometimes they want a vintage kitchen where the appliances haven\u2019t been changed since 1970.\u201d\n\nThe big motivator for homeowners is the payout. \u201cMore often than not people like the money because rarely am I making the check out to a charity,\u201d said Ms. Regan. But there are other lures: vanity, bragging rights and a great story to tell at cocktail parties. Some simply want to be part of a show they love. Mark Lake, of \u201cLaw & Order: SVU,\u201d tells of being in the residence of a \u201cvery high-net-worth individual. He told me that he and his family were big fans of the show and he thought his kids would get a big kick out of having us shoot there.\u201d\n\nFor Ian Reisner, a real estate developer whose Central Park South penthouse has been seen on \u201cLaw & Order: SVU,\u201d \u201d Billions,\u201d \u201cElementary\u201d and \u201cBlue Bloods,\u201d the attraction, at least in part, is seeing the many ways his apartment can be transformed. \u201cThey\u2019ve brought in new furniture. They\u2019ve painted the white walls brown,\u201d said Mr. Reisner whose side career started when a friend introduced him to an associate producer on \u201c30 Rock.\u201d \u201cIt makes your home more dynamic.\u201d", "description": "The pros and cons of having a TV or movie crew take over your home.", "authors": ["Joanne Kaufman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/06/realestate/06onlocation-bennett3/merlin_159762117_40aca6f9-4d60-499c-b982-cfcab70c4741-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
