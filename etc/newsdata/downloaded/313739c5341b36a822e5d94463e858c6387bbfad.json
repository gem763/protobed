According to The Hollywood Reporter, the show Mosley exited was Star Trek: Discovery on CBS All Access. In his Times essay, the author says he had only been working on the show a few weeks when he received a call. \u201cA pleasant-sounding young man said, \u2018Mr. Mosley, it has been reported that you used the N-word in the writers\u2019 room,\u2019\u201d he writes. \u201cI replied, \u2018I am the N-word in the writers\u2019 room.\u201d\n\nPer his essay, a co-worker had apparently contacted HR over an anecdote Mosley had told in the workplace. \u201cI hadn\u2019t called anyone it,\u201d he writes. \u201cI just told a story about a cop who explained to me, on the streets of Los Angeles, that he stopped all n- - - - -s in paddy neighborhoods and all paddies in n- - - - - neighborhoods, because they were usually up to no good. I was telling a true story as I remembered it.\u201d\n\nThe HR representative told the author that his use of the N-word had made the co-worker \u201cuncomfortable,\u201d and that its use was \u201cunacceptable\u201d in the workplace, outside of dialogue in a script. In response, Mosley quit the show. \u201cAs far as I know the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence assure me of both the freedom of speech and the pursuit of happiness,\u201d he writes. \u201cHow can I exercise these freedoms when my place of employment tells me that my job is on the line if I say a word that makes somebody, an unknown person, uncomfortable?\u201d You can read Mosley\u2019s essay in full here.\n\n\u201cWe have the greatest admiration for Mr. Mosley\u2019s writing talents and were excited to have him join Star Trek: Discovery,\u201d CBS Television Studios said in a statement Friday. \u201cWhile we cannot comment on the specifics of confidential employee matters, we are committed to supporting a workplace where employees feel free to express concerns and where they feel comfortable performing their best work. We wish Mr. Mosley much continued success.\u201d", "description": "Novelist and Snowfall consultant Walter Mosley says he left the writers room at Star Trek: Discovery after HR reported to him that someone had complained about his use of the N-word in the workplace.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/6-Walter-Mosley-Essay.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
