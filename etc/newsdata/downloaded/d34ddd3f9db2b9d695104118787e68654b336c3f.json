We remain united and ready to work 24/7 to make this happen \u2013 as we have been for over three years now,\u201d it said.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told Johnson that the proposals did not fully meet agreed objectives, his spokesman said after the two leaders spoke by phone, but agreed to study them in more detail and consult with EU partners.\n\nWith less than a month left until Britain is due to leave the EU, the future of Brexit, its most significant geopolitical move since World War Two, is uncertain. It could leave with a deal or without one - or not leave at all.\n\nDeutsche Bank said it saw a 50 percent chance of a no-deal Brexit by the end of the year. This would spook financial markets, send shockwaves through the global economy, snarl ports on both sides of the Channel and divide the West.\n\nPHONEY BREXIT BATTLE\n\nWhile London\u2019s last-minute proposals do mark some movement on the Irish border, the biggest sticking point of the Brexit negotiations, many EU diplomats are convinced that the United Kingdom is heading towards either a delay or a no-deal exit.\n\nJohnson says he wants to get a deal at an Oct. 17-18 EU summit. A law passed by his opponents forces him to delay Brexit unless he strikes a deal. Johnson said further delay was \u201cpointless and expensive\u201d.\n\nAmid so much pessimism about the possibility of a deal in just weeks, many diplomats say a phoney struggle is underway between London and Brussels to apportion blame.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a game of cat and mouse,\u201d said one EU diplomat.\n\nBrexit negotiator Michel Barnier said the proposals marked progress but more work was needed. Guy Verhofstadt, head of the European Parliament\u2019s Brexit Steering Group, was less convinced.\n\nAsked by a reporter if the proposal was a serious attempt to break the deadlock or designed to shift the blame on to Brussels if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, he said: \u201cI think that last point was not so bad.\u201d\n\nRaoul Ruparel, former Europe adviser to Johnson\u2019s predecessor, Theresa May, said the offer appeared unlikely to win over the EU.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson gives a closing speech at the Conservative Party annual conference in Manchester, Britain, October 2, 2019.
