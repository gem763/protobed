It has also been linked to depression and low fertility.\n\nThe latest study, which was funded by a South Korean cosmetics company, is said to be the first to find a relationship between airborne pollutants and hair loss.\n\nHowever, lead researcher Hyuk Chul Kwok, who revealed the results at the 28th European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Congress in Madrid, said further research was required to confirm the effect outside the laboratory.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The highly social birds will also remember that person if they come near their nests again, according to researchers from the University of Exeter. In the study, a person unknown to the wild jackdaws approached their nest. At the same time scientists played a recording of a warning call (threatening) or \u201ccontact calls\u201d (non-threatening). The next time jackdaws saw this same person, the birds that had previously heard the warning call were defensive and returned to their nests more than twice as quickly on average.
