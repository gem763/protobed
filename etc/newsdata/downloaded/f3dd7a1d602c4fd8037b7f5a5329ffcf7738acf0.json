The debt on Nufarm\u2019s balance sheet is subject to reasonably large fluctuations because of the impact of seasonal conditions on working capital.\n\nBut usually the middle of the year is the least stressful time for debt management. A condition of the sale of Nufarm\u2019s operations in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Chile to Sumitomo is the redemption of the preference securities.\n\nThat tells you the takeover deal, which was initiated by Sumitomo, was negotiated some time after July.\n\nNufarm\u2019s net debt will fall from about $1.25 billion to about $200 million following the completion of the sale to Sumitomo. It is possible Nufarm will conduct some capital management once shareholder approval has been achieved.\n\nThe strategic thinking behind the sale of the Latin American operations was pretty straightforward.\n\nLatin America was a steadily performing business but it was capital intensive because of the unwillingness of farmers to pay their bills in a timely fashion. This put pressure on the balance sheet.\n\nSecondly, the region is notable for its highly volatile currencies. The only prudent way to manage this was through annual hedging arrangements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe costs of managing Nufarm\u2019s receivables and foreign exchange risk in Latin America were taken below the line. That explains why the company on Monday said the multiple paid for the business was 12.3 times underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.\n\nSumitomo, like so many Japanese companies, is expanding internationally from a home base which has one of the lowest costs of capital in the world. It first bought into the Nufarm share register in 2011 with a transaction worth about $650 million.\n\nThe takeover of the Nufarm operations in Latin America is believed to be the largest M &A transaction by Sumitomo Chemical.\n\nThe Japanese clearly have confidence in Hunt and his management team given the two year supply agreement in South America and the confirmation Nufarm will be Sumitomo\u2019s preferred commercialisation partner in Germany, Poland and South America.\n\nThe deal is good news for the investors who backed Nufarm including Ellerston Capital, Allan Gray and Firetrail Investments. They have stuck with a company which has underperformed the broader market over the past 10 years, five years, three years, two years and one year, according to Bloomberg.\n\nA big contributing factor in this was the negative impact of the drought in Australia.\n\nHunt, who has been running the company since 2015, now has an opportunity to reset the market view of Nufarm. He will lose about $120 million in EBITDA from the sale of the Latin American operations but interest payments will fall by about $70 million a year.\n\nAt a time when the Japanese are willing to pay about 12 times for earnings, Nufarm was on Monday trading at about seven to eight times EBITDA.", "description": "The sale of Nufarm's Latin American business smites short sellers and gives CEO Greg Hunt room to manage the remaining global crop protection businesses.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_140/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e0b76f10eb1e749697eb30827b280b536e70f375", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
