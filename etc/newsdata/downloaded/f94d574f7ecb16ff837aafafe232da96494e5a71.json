That has produced a patronage system expertly exploited by the politicians.\n\nThe protesters have called on all their leaders to resign - a handful of ministers have gone but so far most are resisting.\n\nOn Monday, embattled Prime Minister Saad Hariri unveiled a raft of economic reforms, which he hopes will assuage some of the protesters' anger. He promised to slash politicians' pay, invest in power plants and also tax banks to help reduce public debt.\n\nIn a speech, Mr Hariri was careful not to inflame the situation further, saying he had heard people's anger.\n\nBut many demonstrators believe it is too little too late and they are vowing to stay on the streets to \"topple the regime\".\n\n\"It was all too vague,\" one young protester told me. \"Why didn't they do it 30 years ago?\"\n\nBut Lebanon's political leaders will be hoping that the protests - which have been spontaneous rather than organised - will eventually fizzle out.\n\nIf that does not happen, the country will be heading deeper into uncharted territory. That will alarm the West, which regards Lebanon as an island of relative stability in a turbulent Middle East.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Lebanon protesters: \"We can make a change\"\n\nWhat is undeniable is that Lebanon is a country that feels reborn in the past week. People who were marginalised for decades suddenly feel they can hold their political elite to account and demand changes.\n\nThe power-sharing agreement that ended the civil war 30 years ago may have kept the peace but it has also created economic misery for many Lebanese - and is now creaking.\n\nHowever, the carnival-like atmosphere, where kids come to protest with their parents and demonstrators dance up a storm in Tripoli, masks the real dangers. Old divisions die hard here.\n\nLebanon's leaders may have been paralysed by these protests but that does not mean they are going to hand over power without a fight.", "description": "Lebanon is in the grip of an extraordinary revolt against the country's politicians.", "authors": ["Martin Patience", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07rjlk4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
