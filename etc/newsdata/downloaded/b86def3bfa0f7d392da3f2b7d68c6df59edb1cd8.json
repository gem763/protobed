The Crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting \u2018C\u2019 Subpoena!\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s response: \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me. Do your job.\u201d\n\nThe Democrat\u2019s rejoinder comes less than one week after she acknowledged the \u201cdevastating\u201d nature of her 2016 loss to Mr. Trump and the opinion that she miscalculated with a \u201ctoo serious\u201d campaign persona.\n\n\u201cIt was devastating as it was, I know, for the McCain family and your family [with Jon Huntsman in 2012],\u201d she said Wednesday during an interview on \u201cThe View.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a serious person but I\u2019m also a fun person, but I think I probably came across as too serious.\n\n\u201cI really believed that my job, especially as a woman and the first woman to go as far as I did, that I had to help people feel good about a woman in the Oval Office, a woman commander in chief, and so I may have overcorrected a little bit because sometimes people say, \u2018well why can\u2019t you be like that?\u2019 or \u2018why weren\u2019t you like that?\u2019\u201d\n\nShe added that \u201cunprecedented events\u201d involving Russia\u2019s meddling into the election also played a factor in her loss.\n\nThe Trump-Clinton exchange came a day after a Rassmussen Reports poll found that a rematch of the 2016 presidential election would be tied.\n\n\n\nAccording to the conservative-leaning pollster, Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton each would get 45% of the vote, though Rassmussen also noted that the overwhelming majority of voters don\u2019t want Mrs. Clinton to make a third presidential bid.\n\nI think that Crooked Hillary Clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren. Only one condition. The Crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting \u201cC\u201d Subpoena! Don\u2019t tempt me.
