In the last 36 hours, there have been 14 \u201cprovocative attacks\u201d from Syria, Turkey\u2019s defense ministry said.\n\nEsper said that the ceasefire in northeastern Syria was generally holding.\n\n\u201cI think overall the ceasefire generally seems to be holding, we see a stabilization of the lines, if you will, on the ground, and we do get reports of intermittent fires, this and that, that doesn\u2019t surprise me necessarily,\u201d he added.\n\nThere has been concern that the Turkish incursion into northeastern Syria would allow Daesh militants to make gains and see militants escaping prisons guarded by Kurdish fighters.\n\nEsper said that the United States was still in contact with the Kurdish fighters, known as the YPG, and they appeared to continue to defend the prisons in areas they still controlled.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "nearly 1,000 troops withdrawing from northern Syria are expected to move to western Iraq to continue the campaign against Daesh", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/251920_4123489_updates.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
