We know because Tori had it delivered right into her AOL inbox. As BH90210 wraps its inaugural season, the fate of the show within the show\u2014much like the real life fate of BH90210\u2014hangs in the balance. The pilot is in the can (yay), but can our little show that could beat out the Mischa Barton-as-a-ghost-reboot of The O.C. that is also vying for one of Fox\u2019s fall slots? While Christine forces the gang to drum up good publicity and nostalgia at a Peach Pit pop-up, the results from test audiences send them reeling. Since we are at a crossroads, this audience of two would like to assess this (hopefully not) last hurrah, cast member by cast member.\n\nTest audiences thought that \u201cSteve Sanders\u2019 macho swagger feels old school, like being in a time capsule.\u201d Some faulty #MeToo \u201ccomedy\u201d aside, our report for Ian Ziering is much more favorable, as we were ultimately charmed by our formerly permed one. IZ started off the season as some sort of brand-obsessed celeb with a philandering Real Housewives wannabe wife. (Remember Tori\u2019s face on his products?) But since overcoming his fear of women in the workplace, he Cyrano\u2019d himself into falling for Anna, and is now heartsore that she gave him the no-strings-attached speech. Sorry, but wasn\u2019t Ian just married two seconds ago, and now he wants to settle down again? Get it together, boy. Regardless, we fell for IZ\u2019s storyline and think the ante was upped by the arrival of his new piece, Denise Richards, who is quickly revealed to be\u2026 Anna\u2019s mother! Readers, we gasped. This casting is, dare we say, perfection. Denise is the cast\u2019s contemporary, she got her start on the original 90210, had a small role on the CW reboot, and because of her marriage to Charlie Sheen and her recent stint on Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, has become an icon of the zipcode. Plus she and Ian have real chemistry and we\u2019d pay streaming service fees to watch them together. All hail the casting office at Greenstein/Daniel.\n\nWhile audiences LOLed at Andrea\u2019s gayness, our report on Gabrielle Carteris is.. .complicated. Gab has been one of our personal favorites all season, what with her queer questioning and house-mother clapping energy. (This bit is such a weird specific and we just love the cast for all being EPs and having capital-I Ideas.) We saw her have honest conversations with her husband about her sexuality and we saw her get busy with The Artist Formerly Known as Emily Valentine. But as this summer series winds down, the awful truth is that Gab has done the full Kissing Jessica Stein, which is to say she used Andrea (and Christine) to explore her rainbow connection, but ended the season kissing her husband and doing the whole \u201cit\u2019s not really my thing\u201d thing. But for us two queerdos, Andrea (and Gab) questioning her sexuality made total sense. Here\u2019s hoping this wasn\u2019t the age-old \u201clesbian for Sweeps\u201d bit and that season two will have Gab fully embracing her Desert Heart(s).\n\nDavid Silver\u2019s audience feedback is about him being a zaddy, which, like, neat-o. Anyway, for our part, we\u2019re giving Brian Austin Green\u2014it\u2019s the finale so we\u2019re saying the whole enchilada\u2014middling reviews. BAG has been embroiled in the series\u2019 main mystery plot, which never really gets resolved, even in this last episode when Shay reveals that BB is not BAG\u2019s biological son (though BB maintains he\u2019s only here because his mama told him BAG was the baby daddy). BAG is annoyed by Shay\u2019s meddling but determined to maintain some sort of relationship with his non-son thanks to sage advice from his spiritual guide and DL BFF, Shannen. When BAG shows Jason the photo of young BAG with the mother, who is in fact a fake Vanessa Marcil (former 90210 co-star, former BAG IRL love interest, and mother of his estranged son), suddenly Jason has a flash: Is he the father? Ay yi yi, this is getting convoluted so let\u2019s just send those notes to the season two writing room.\n\nFolks love Brandon with Kelly but are decidedly anti the Angelina and Jame- level sexual chemistry between him and his twin, Brenda. This peanut gallery thinks, well, was Jason even in this episode? Jason is with his wife, Camille. Is he at her hospital bedside? Ooh no, the writers let this one whimper, not bang, so Jason and Camille are in the Bahamas where she, perhaps with the courage of kamikazes, tells him they need to call it quits. But oh yes, she\u2019d still like to take his 12 percent. Is she still pregnant? Does it matter? Look, we prefer club-owning, scarf-wearing Jason who likes to rumble and makes doe eyes at Jennie G from time to time. We guess real life Jason was busy directing and therefore a little removed? The bottom line is his scarcity made it hard to root for whatever is brewing with Jennie Garth.\n\nOur feelings on Jennie are not dissimilar to the audience research for Kelly Taylor: \u201cAudiences related to Kelly Taylor\u2019s struggle as a middle-aged woman but found her storyline depressing.\u201d It\u2019s like, sames. Jennie didn\u2019t have any major trauma this series, but maybe she needed some. She was so invested in her new IPA-loving bodyguard that she stopped paying attention to her daughter, who is back and we once again loathe. Bodyguard got a fanboy tattoo, and so he\u2019s gone for good. It\u2019s as if Jennie couldn\u2019t get a storyline to stick this season. Surprise, her best stuff was with Tori (we ship this pair) and Jason. (Does she still \u201cchoose me\u201d?) If Shannen had actually driven to Vancouver to film earlier in the season we would have been into seeing more of Jennie fuming over Shannen Instagram-influencing her daughter with Deepak Chopra quotes.\n\nEveryone continues to be creeped out by the hot-for your twin vibe, but audiences also want Bren to be more of a classic Shannen shit-stirrer. Our Shannen report is quite simple: please be in the same motherfucking room as the rest of the cast and crew. We estimate that Shannen appeared in less than eight minutes an episode, like she\u2019s Dame Judi Dench or something. She was committed to shooting most of her early scenes on green screens, but for the finale all her scenes were in-person, just with two cast members at a time. There was a fun moment where they all show up to the Upfronts in red dresses (our girl Gab is in white pants), and that feels like, aw, shucks, we needed more of this. Lucky for us, Ms. With-an-E did get a dream sequence in which Brenda and Brandon make out in bed. Inc\u2019est si bon!\n\nDonna Martin\u2019s feedback says that Tori is endearing as Donna even if Tori the reality star is polarizing. This sentiment may have been true, but anyone who has been watching BH90210 must now agree that Tori is the heart and soul of the show. This week Tori is getting her wages garnished and just trying to keep the lights on, while her whiny husband is struggling with the label of stay-at-home dad. It takes BAG and Ian singing Tori\u2019s praises over plant-based burgers to get Nate to wake up and start appreciating his wife. What does Dean McDermott think? Oh, and everybody loves David and Donna. Us too. Tori and BAG silently acknowledging that they both would\u2019ve been happier had they married each other made our hearts grow three sizes.\n\nGood news: after an entire episode of will it/won\u2019t it, the pilot got picked up! Bad news: it has to be re-shot (in Canada!), the supporting roles have to be re-cast, and Fox can only afford six of the seven principals! It has been a wild ride in this I8A4RE license-plated Corvette, and we\u2019ve been so tickled to spend time with these old friends and you, our new ones. But Donna Martin has graduated, figuratively, which is to say, it\u2019s the end. We\u2019re crossing our Joe E. Tatas for another season, but should we never meet again, thanks for the peaches and the pits, the cameos and in-jokes, the rooster, the egg, and the gift that will always be Shannen Doherty covered in blood, monologuing about a wounded possum. The data doesn\u2019t lie: BH90210 is the legacy key we didn\u2019t know we needed.\n\nPeaches\n\n\u2022 In the last month alone we\u2019ve seen real life Gabrielle Carteris get re-elected as president of SAG-AFTRA and BH90210 Gabrielle Carteris have gay sex for the first time!\n\n\u2022 Ian\u2019s self-deprecating Sharknado chops were on full display in his Peach Pit sequence where he talked to his former self in a mullet.\n\n\u2022 Hat\u2019s off to SHANNEN MFING DOHERTY for the simple fact that she collected a fat ass paycheck by monologuing to herself on a park bench.\n\nPits\n\n\u2022 We\u2019ve got nothing. We loved every second of this backstage event series that was way better than it ever needed to be. But that last shot did make us desperately miss Luke Perry.", "description": "The focus group data is in, so let\u2019s assess this (hopefully not) last hurrah, cast member by cast member.
