The key criteria for the Form D exemption is that only \u201caccredited investors,\u201d that is, individuals that have a net worth of over $1 million, or that have consistently made over $200,000 per year in income, or companies that have over $5 million in assets, can invest.\n\nMarketWatch first reported the back-door ICO fundraising tactic in February 2018.\n\nTo read: Here\u2019s the blueprint for how ICOs are getting off the ground without SEC vetting\n\nSee also: ICO promoters more careful but still using SEC back door to raise funds\n\nThe markedly diminished activity so far in 2019 compares to 2018, when the SEC accepted 287 ICO-related fundraisings with a total stated value of $8.7 billion via Form D\u2019s.\n\nICO-related fundraising activity hits its peak with 99 filings in the second quarter of 2018. That was a significant ramp from 2017, when the activity rose from zero in the first quarter to one filing in the second quarter to a total of 44 ICO-related fundraisings, with a total stated value of $2.1 billion, by the end of 2017.\n\nThe MarketWatch analysis identified the filings by searching the SEC\u2019s Edgar database for mentions of keywords including \u201ccoin,\u201d \u201cICO,\u201d \u201ctoken,\u201d \u201cinitial coin offering\u201d and \u201csaft\u201d in Form D filings.\n\nThe most recent filings are forging ahead despite the SEC\u2019s introduction of significant legal obstacles.\n\nThe SEC obtained a temporary restraining order on Oct. 15 against Telegram Group Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary TON Issuer Inc., two British Virgin Islands-based entities, alleging it was conducting an unregistered, ongoing digital token offering in the U.S. and overseas that had, so far, raised more than $1.7 billion of investor funds.\n\nRead: Fighting SEC to issue Gram tokens is going to be tough for messaging app Telegram\n\nMedia reported that the company told investors it had been in talks with the SEC for the past 18 months regarding its project. MarketWatch reported in February 2018, that Telegram had filed a Form D with the SEC on Feb. 13, 2018, telling the SEC it had already raised $850 million out of a billion-dollar-plus target beginning Jan. 29, 2018.\n\nIn early 2018, the SEC issued several subpoenas to crypto-related companies under the guise of information-gathering that would assist the SEC with better understanding the legal and regulatory as well as market dynamics of ICO investments.\n\nSome companies that received those subpoenas settled early. In November 2018, the SEC settled charges against two ICO issuers \u2014 CarrierEQ Inc., or Airfox, and Paragon Coin Inc. \u2014 for launching unregistered coin offerings. It was the first civil penalty administered solely for violations from an ICO securities offering registration.\n\nThe SEC sued Kik Interactive in June 2019 for raising $100 million without registering the offering of securities with the regulator. Kik also used a Form D offering to reach investors initially in late 2017, starting out by raising money from wealthy investors but then targeting a broader base.\n\nSee also: SEC action threatens billions raised in initial coin offerings that ostensibly targeted only wealthy investors\n\nOthers have reluctantly settled recently. Block.one agreed to pay $24 million after it took advantage of peak ICO hype to sell 900 million tokens in 2017 and 2018, raising billions of dollars.", "description": "The SEC is slowly sticking a fork in the Form D exempt offering approach to ICO fundraising first reported by MarketWatch, sticking a fork in the biggest...", "authors": ["Francine Mckenna", "Katie Marriner", "Interactives Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GE664_ICO_03_ZG_20180301113300.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
