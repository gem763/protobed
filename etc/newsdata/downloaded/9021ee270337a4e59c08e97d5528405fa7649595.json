Any tech exec who appeared to differ from the accepted opinion was reprimanded. Facebook apologized for one of its execs, Joel Kaplan, after he attended the Kavanaugh hearing because it appeared that he was supporting the judicial nominee. The company hosted an internal town hall to quell employee anger over Kaplan\u2019s attendance.\n\nBig Tech exhibits serious hypocrisy on sexual misconduct, and there\u2019s no better exemplar of this than Hoffman himself. He claims not to tolerate violence against women, yet he helped rehabilitate Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s image.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHoffman invited Epstein to fundraise for MIT Media Lab in 2015. That kind of elite support allowed Epstein to return to polite society and continue with his heinous crimes. The Microsoft exec also defended then-MIT Media Lab director Joi Ito, who took several donations from Epstein. Hoffman attacked reporters for investigating Ito and his ties to the pedophile.\n\nHoffman apologized for his Epstein association earlier this month, but his apology is too little too late. The damage is already done.\n\nThe Microsoft associate\u2019s relationship with Epstein contrasts sharply with the image he has tried to cultivate.\n\nHoffman promoted the \u201cDecency Pledge\u201d in 2017, which said that investors should \u201crefuse to do business\u201d with accused sexual harassers. He was particularly incensed by the \u201coutrageous and immoral behavior\u201d of execs who\u2019d abused the power relationship between boss and employee. Yet he did not seem incensed by accusations that Epstein had abused his power to exploit the most vulnerable.\n\nMoreover, taking this pledge seriously would blacklist most Big Tech monopolies. Consider the allegations against top Google lawyer David Drummond. Drummond was accused by a former employee in August of abusing his power and having multiple affairs with women he supervised. Drummond still works as Google\u2019s senior legal chief in spite of the allegations. Microsoft, meanwhile, is facing a lawsuit for failing to act on 238 internal complaints of rape, sexual harassment, and sex discrimination.\n\nBig Tech is desperate to attract women to its ranks, but Hoffman\u2019s actions likely hurt that cause. Microsoft CEO Brad Smith writes in his new book that more women need to work in Big Tech and argues that tech companies are partially responsible for the dearth of women in the industry since they haven\u2019t done enough to recruit them.\n\nHe writes: \u201c[T]he world of technology remained stubbornly slow in recognizing and creating opportunities for women more broadly. At most tech companies, women still represent 30 percent of the workforce, and an even lower percentage of technical roles.\u201d\n\nWhat do those women think of a Microsoft associate helping out Jeffrey Epstein? Do they think that\u2019s a culture they want to join?\n\nBay Buchanan served as U.S. Treasurer for Ronald Reagan, as Pat Buchanan\u2019s campaign manager in 1992, 1996, and 2000, and as a senior advisor to Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blasey-epstein-1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
