Most meteors glow for only a few seconds prior to burning up before hitting the Earth's surface.\u201d\n\nThe sighting comes just days before one of the most beautiful meteor showers of the year - the Orionid meteor shower.\n\nThe spectacular event will take place between 2 October and 7 November this year.\n\nHowever, the best time to see it will be at the peak, on 21 and 22 October, when you will be able to see 10 to 20 meteors per hour in a moonless sky.", "description": "The dazzling fireball appeared on Friday at around 00:16 CST, and was so bright that it turned the night into day", "authors": ["Shivali Best", "Image", "Live Science"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20583621.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Huge-meteor-fireball-turns-night-into-day-as-it-streaks-through-sky-over-China.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
