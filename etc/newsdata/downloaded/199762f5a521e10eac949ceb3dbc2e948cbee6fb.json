Rashida Tlaib, Michigan\u2019s far left of left Democratic congresswoman, called for a complete transformation of America\u2019s government \u2014 a \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d and \u201ceconomic\u201d overhaul to change the capitalistic system and, as she framed it, to put the people, not the corporations, back in power.\n\nThis is not simply a difference of political differences; a Democrat view versus a Republican view. This is treasonous. It\u2019s treason wrapped in a social justice ribbon.\n\nTlaib is a member of the U.S. Congress, bound by oath of office to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.\n\nYet this is what she put on Twitter, as noted by Breitbart: \u201cWe have to make the tough, courageous changes that completely transform a political and economic system that is now built for corporations (and profits), not people. Choosing the status quo means doing nothing and giving up. We need a political revolution.\u201d\n\nNo.\n\nWe don\u2019t.\n\nWhat we need are duly elected politicians who swear to support and defend the Constitution to actually support and defend the Constitution.\n\nLeftists, masquerading as Democrats, cloaking their destructive political designs as calls for social justice and equality for all, are stealthily upsetting the Constitution and tearing at the fabric of America\u2019s government \u2014 from the inside. And their rhetoric is becoming bolder.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, in June, called for a\u201dpolitical revolution\u201d as well, explaining just how his particular brand of socialism should sell in America.\n\n\u201cWe need a new vision for America, which I call democratic socialism, which says that economic rights are human rights,\u201d Sanders said then, Newsweek reported. \u201cThat everybody in this country, because they\u2019re in America, is entitled to health care as a right, is entitled to a decent paying job as a right, is entitled to a dignified retirement as a right, is entitled to a clean environment as a right, and is entitled to all of the education they need to accomplish their life goals.\u201d\n\nFine and dandy. Sounds like heaven on earth. Except when the bills come due.\n\nSanders is selling a false narrative because when he talks about the rights of health care, the rights of education and so forth, he neglects to clarify that the Constitution already secures those very rights \u2014 absent the tax-paid part. Citizens in America, based on the fact they\u2019re born Americans, and therefore are endowed by their Creator with unalienable rights, are already bestowed the rights of pursuits of education, jobs, homes and so forth.\n\nSanders, the left \u2014 Tlaib \u2014 would like to change that system so it guarantees citizens the tax-paid funding to pursue these goals.\n\nThat\u2019s the treasonous part.\n\nAmerica is not a socialist country where the government steals money from one to give to another.\n\nAmerica is a country of set rules and limited government, where citizens are free to pursue their goals and dreams and hopes and aspirations \u2014 but only insofar as their goals and dreams and hopes and aspirations don\u2019t demand others pay their way.\n\n\u201cThis is not utopian,\u201d Sanders said in June of his socialist vision for America. \u201cThis is what we can accomplish and which already exists in a number of other countries.\u201d\n\nAnd that right there is the skinny: America is not like other countries.\n\nNor should America ever be like other countries.\n\nAnd politicians who call for America to toss aside its Constitution, rip up its republic and instead go socialist \u2014 who call for complete economic and political overhaul and \u201crevolution\u201d \u2014 don\u2019t deserve to serve in public office.\n\nThey don\u2019t deserve to represent the people; they don\u2019t deserve paychecks from the American people.\n\nThey are treasonous in their thinking, treasonous in their political rhetoric, treasonous in their pressings and have no business feigning service to the Constitution or country.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
