When they tried to refuse, he allegedly 'made them feel guilty by telling them that he is \"very sad.\"'\n\nScroll down to read complaint\n\nBerdoll had taught at the Fine Arts Academy in Atascadero, California, since 2011; he resigned in September 2018\n\nThe veteran teacher also allegedly used other methods to lure the girls into his classroom during breaks, such as bringing his dog to school 'knowing that the girls love dogs.'\n\n'When the girls managed to avoid his lunch meetings, he would find them on the playground and lurk around them while carrying his iPad,' according to the complaint.\n\nThe Atascadero Police Department said in a news release at the time of Berdoll's arrest that the school district contacted the police about \u2018the possibility of a district teacher who had inappropriately video-recorded the undergarments of female students.\u2019\n\nThe investigation that followed revealed that Berdoll allegedly used a phone or a tablet to secretly take upskirt videos and photos of multiple female students in his math class during the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 school years.\n\n\u2018It currently appears that none of the schoolchildren involved were physically molested; however, inappropriate videotaping did take place,\u2019 the press release stated.\n\nWhen police executed a search warrant at Berdoll's home, they reportedly recovered images and videos depicting girls' legs, crotches and backsides under their desks.\n\nThe teacher also would allegedly stand behind the students with his phone or iPad in hand when the girls got up to sharpen pencils, or to help him hang posters on the wall.\n\nAccording to the federal lawsuit, Berdoll also spliced images of himself having sex with photos and videos of his female students.\n\nThe federal lawsuit filed on behalf of Berdoll's alleged victims is seeking unspecified 'full and fair compensation' for the adolescent plaintiffs.\n\nThe Bloom Firm, which is handling the case, is headed by high-powered civil rights attorney Lisa Bloom, who in the past represented women who accused former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly of sexual harassment, and who also advised Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein as he faced mounting sexual assault allegations.\n\nBerdoll is currently out on $500,000 bail pending his October 29 arraignment on 44 criminal counts related to child pornography.\n\nCelebrity attorney Lisa Bloom's firm has filed the federal lawsuit on behalf of the six young plaintiffs\n\nHe was initially placed on paid leave, and in late September 2018 he resigned from the school where he had taught for seven years.\n\nIn August 2018 - less than two weeks before Berdoll's arrest - the Atascadero Unified School District retained the Fresno law firm of Atkinson, Andelson, Loya, Ruud & Romo to conduct an investigation into allegations of misconduct on Berdoll's part.\n\nThree months later, the firm produced a seven-page Title IX report outlining its findings.\n\nAccording to the report obtained by DailyMail.com, on August 20, 2018, Berdoll asked one of his students if she could help him during a break to set up the classroom for a science lesson. Two other girls joined in to give them a hand.\n\nWhile the first girl got up on a chair to hang some posters, Berdoll reportedly approached her from behind with a recording device at his chest level and videotaped her backside.\n\nWhen the girl on the chair turned around, 'she was him quickly withdrew the recording devise [sic] toward his chest, as if he knew he had been caught doing something improper,' the report stated.\n\nThe document went on to list numerous similar examples of female students in Berdoll's class allegedly catching him in the act of recording their crotches, backsides and legs with his phone or iPad on campus.\n\nThe report concluded that the school district took 'timely actions' consistent with Title IX parameters for agency response by placing the teacher on leave and notifying students and parents.", "description": "A federal lawsuit has been filed against former California\u00a0teacher Chris Berdoll, 48, and the Atascadero Unified School District over upskirt photos and videos of female students.", "authors": ["Snejana Farberov For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/22/20053392-0-image-a-96_1571778003533.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
