REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nJavid rejected calls from some members of parliament for an economic impact assessment of the agreement struck by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the EU earlier on Thursday which now needs approval by lawmakers.\n\nInstead, he said, parliament had to realise that the plan would end the uncertainty that has dogged the world\u2019s fifth-biggest economy since voters decided to leave the EU in 2016.\n\n\u201cIt is self-evident that what we have achieved in terms of this deal is the right way forward for the economy, much better than any alternative,\u201d Javid told reporters on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank fall meetings.\n\nFurthermore, Brexit was not just a debate about economics, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is also an issue about the fabric of our democracy. People want to see Brexit done. They overwhelmingly prefer to see that done with a good deal and that is what we have achieved,\u201d Javid said.\n\nLawmakers opposed to Brexit have warned that the prime minister\u2019s plan will hurt the economy.\n\nLast year, Britain\u2019s finance ministry estimated that the hit to growth from a free trade deal with the EU, similar to Johnson\u2019s plan, would be greater than the impact of closer ties proposed by former prime minister Theresa May.\n\nAsked about the Treasury\u2019s research, Javid said it was based on assumptions that did not necessarily apply to the new deal which offered the most promise for striking trade agreements with countries around the world.\n\nJohnson has said he will take Britain out of the EU on Oct. 31, if necessary without a transition deal.\n\nHowever, British lawmakers have passed legislation that they say would force a Brexit delay rather than a no-deal Brexit.\n\nJavid said he saw a \u201cdecent chance\u201d the plan would clear parliament, despite the opposition of a Northern Irish party which has been a key ally of Johnson.\n\nJavid also said the search for the next Bank of England governor was on track and was going \u201cvery, very smoothly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the most important thing for me is I really, crucially value the independence of the Bank of England and I want someone who values that too and will be independent-minded,\u201d he said, declining to comment further.\n\nOn his budget plans, Javid said he believed interest rates would be low for a long time and he reiterated that he was looking at how to take advantage of cheap borrowing costs to increase long-term productive public investment.\n\n\u201cI traded bonds markets for 20 years and I\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d the former Deutsche Bank managing director said, explaining why he is considering new fiscal rules that are expected to relax the government\u2019s grip on the public finances.", "description": "Britain's new Brexit deal has a \"decent chance\" of clearing parliament on Saturday and the alternative is to leave the European Union in two weeks' time without anything to soften the economic shock, finance minister Sajid Javid said.", "authors": ["William Schomberg", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441995557&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G1YO", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
