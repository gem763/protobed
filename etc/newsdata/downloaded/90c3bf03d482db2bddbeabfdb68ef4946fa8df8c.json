These are the solutions Facebook employees put forward in an open letter pleading with CEO Mark Zuckerberg and company leadership to address misinformation in political ads.\n\nThe letter, obtained by The New York Times\u2019 Mike Isaac, insists that \u201cFree speech and paid speech are not the same thing . . . Our current policies on fact checking people in political office, or those running for office, are a threat to what FB stands for.\u201d The letter was posted to Facebook\u2019s internal collaboration forum a few weeks ago.\n\nThe sentiments echo what I called for in a TechCrunch opinion piece on October 13th calling on Facebook to ban political ads. Unfettered misinformation in political ads on Facebook lets politicians and their supporters spread inflammatory and inaccurate claims about their views and their rivals while racking up donations to buy more of these ads.\n\nThe social network can still offer freedom of expression to political campaigns on their own Facebook Pages while limiting the ability of the richest and most dishonest to pay to make their lies the loudest. We suggested that if Facebook won\u2019t drop political ads, they should be fact checked and/or use an array of generic \u201cvote for me\u201d or \u201cdonate here\u201d ad units that don\u2019t allow accusations. We also criticized how microtargeting of communities vulnerable to misinformation and instant donation links make Facebook ads more dangerous than equivalent TV or radio spots.\n\nMore than 250 employees of Facebook\u2019s 35,000 staffers have signed the letter, which declares, \u201cWe strongly object to this policy as it stands. It doesn\u2019t protect voices, but instead allows politicians to weaponize our platform by targeting people who believe that content posted by political figures is trustworthy.\u201d It suggests the current policy undermines Facebook\u2019s election integrity work, confuses users about where misinformation is allowed, and signals Facebook is happy to profit from lies.\n\nThe solutions suggested include:\n\nDon\u2019t accept political ads unless they\u2019re subject to third-party fact checks Use visual design to more strongly differentiate between political ads and organic non-ad posts Restrict microtargeting for political ads including the use of Custom Audiences since microtargeted hides ads from as much public scrutiny that Facebook claims keeps politicians honest Observe pre-election silence periods for political ads to limit the impact and scale of misinformation Limit ad spending per politician or candidate, with spending by them and their supporting political action committees combined Make it more visually clear to users that political ads aren\u2019t fact-checked\n\nA combination of these approaches could let Facebook stop short of banning political ads without allowing rampant misinformation or having to police individual claims.\n\nFacebook\u2019s response to the letter was \u201cWe remain committed to not censoring political speech, and will continue exploring additional steps we can take to bring increased transparency to political ads.\u201d But that straw-man\u2019s the letter\u2019s request. Employees aren\u2019t asking politicians to be kicked off Facebook or have their posts/ads deleted. They\u2019re asking for warning labels and limits on paid reach. That\u2019s not censorship.\n\nZuckerberg had stood resolute on the policy despite backlash from the press and lawmakers, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). She left him tongue-tied during a congressional testimony when she asked exactly what kinds of misinfo were allowed in ads.\n\nBut then Friday, Facebook blocked an ad designed to test its limits by claiming Republican Lindsey Graham had voted for Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green Deal he actually opposes. Facebook told Reuters it will fact-check PAC ads.\n\nOne sensible approach for politicians\u2019 ads would be for Facebook to ramp up fact-checking, starting with presidential candidates until it has the resources to scan more. Those fact-checked as false should receive an interstitial warning blocking their content rather than just a \u201cfalse\u201d label. That could be paired with giving political ads a bigger disclaimer without making them too prominent-looking in general and only allowing targeting by state.\n\nDeciding on potential spending limits and silent periods would be more messy. Low limits could even the playing field and broad silent periods, especially during voting periods, and could prevent voter suppression. Perhaps these specifics should be left to Facebook\u2019s upcoming independent Oversight Board that acts as a supreme court for moderation decisions and policies.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s core argument for the policy is that over time, history bends toward more speech, not censorship. But that succumbs to utopic fallacy that assumes technology evenly advantages the honest and dishonest. In reality, sensational misinformation spreads much further and faster than level-headed truth. Microtargeted ads with thousands of variants undercut and overwhelm the democratic apparatus designed to punish liars, while partisan news outlets counter attempts to call them out.\n\nZuckerberg wants to avoid Facebook becoming the truth police. But as we and employees have put forward, there is a progressive approach to limiting misinformation if he\u2019s willing to step back from his philosophical orthodoxy.\n\nThe full text of the letter from Facebook employees to leadership about political ads can be found below, via The New York Times:", "description": "Submit campaign ads to fact checking, limit microtargeting, cap spending, observe silence periods or at least warn users.
