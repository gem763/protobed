Some people call this states\u2019 rights, but those people are wrong. States don\u2019t have rights. As the US Constitution clearly points out, only people have rights and those rights are inalienable.\n\nAs part of their plan to ensure this remained the case, the founders of the US ensured that individual state territories would always have their own governments operating alongside the federal government.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a good thing they did. Because when Ajit Pai successfully managed to repeal net neutrality, he did so without a mandate from the US people, with more than 80 percent in favor of keeping it. He used fraudulently obtained comments to make a biased decision in tandem with telcom lobbyists against the interests of the US people. He, and other GOP politicians, lied over and over to push a laughably false rhetoric surrounding the net neutrality debate, until eventually federal net neutrality was gone.\n\nWhen a judge recently ruled that the FCC\u2018s thoughts on net neutrality didn\u2019t apply to or supersede state laws, such as California\u2019s strongest-in-the-nation net neutrality rules, we were once again protected from tyranny and corruption by the Constitution.\n\nAccording to a CNBC report, Pai made the case against federalism at a WSJ Tech Live event yesterday. Reporter Marguerite Reardon writes:\n\nHe argued that \u201cwhile that federalist system has served us very well\u201d up to this point in our nation\u2019s history, it\u2019s time for Congress to consider \u201cwhether or not we can still maintain a multilayer regulatory system.\u201d He said allowing states and local governments to pass their own laws regulating internet services, which inherently cross state lines, creates market uncertainty. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about the choice for a venture capitalist or an entrepreneur to set up shop in the United States where they have to get permission from the federal government or from the state of California, San Francisco, or some other jurisdiction, or whether they should set up shop in country B where there\u2019s a uniform, well-established set of regulations that are consistent, I worry that the proposition value for country B will become stronger over time.\n\nPai may be a big deal in the telcom industry, where he was once a lawyer for Verizon, but it\u2019s unclear how he plans to spin his limited clout as the head of the FCC into a bonafide campaign to abolish federalism and change the very nature of our democracy.\n\nIf history\u2019s any indicator, he\u2019ll use lies, duplicity, corruption and a complete disdain for the people\u2019s mandate to accomplish his goals while simultaneously mocking the citizens whose taxes pay for his betrayals.\n\nRead next: Facebook pledges $1B to help fix California's housing crisis (good luck with that)", "description": "", "authors": ["Tristan Greene"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F06%2Fdick_flag.jpg&signature=03b506e2cef0454739976a5b22f9840e", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
