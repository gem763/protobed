REUTERS/Morteza Nikoubazl/Files\n\n\u201cBe careful, a limited aggression will not remain limited.\n\nWe will pursue any aggressor,\u201d the head of the Guards, Major General Hossein Salami, said in remarks broadcast on state TV.\n\n\u201cWe are after punishment and we will continue until the full destruction of any aggressor.\u201d\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump on Friday approved sending American troops to bolster Saudi Arabia\u2019s air and missile defences after the Sept. 14 attack, which Washington has squarely blamed on Iran.\n\nIran denies involvement in the attack, which was claimed by Yemen\u2019s Houthi movement, a group aligned with Iran and currently fighting a Saudi-led alliance in Yemen\u2019s civil war.\n\nAmirali Hajizadeh, who heads the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 aerospace branch, said any attacks on Iran would receive \u201ca crushing response\u201d, the official news agency IRNA reported.\n\nHajizadeh was speaking at a public exposition called \u201cHunting Vultures\u201d where remains of drones downed in Iran and the Iranian air defence system which shot down a U.S. military drone in June were displayed.\n\nThe exposition is part of annual events commemorating the start of the 1980-88 war with Iraq, which also includes air and naval displays in the Gulf and military parades on Sunday.\n\nIran\u2019s foreign minister earlier denounced renewed U.S. sanctions against its central bank following the Saudi attacks as an attempt to deny ordinary Iranians access to food and medicine, and said the move was a sign of U.S. desperation.\n\nThe United States on Friday imposed more sanctions on Iran, some aimed at its central bank and sovereign wealth fund.\n\n\u201cThis is a sign of U.S. desperation ... When they repeatedly sanction the same institution, this means their attempt at bringing the Iranian nation to its knees under \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 has failed,\u201d Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told reporters in remarks shown on state television.\n\n\u201cBut this is dangerous and unacceptable as an attempt at blocking ... the Iranian people\u2019s access to food and medicine,\u201d Zarif said, speaking after arriving in New York for the annual U.N. General Assembly next week.\n\nCYBER-ATTACK\n\nMeanwhile, there were reports on social media that a number of Iranian servers and websites - including those of some petrochemical firms - were under a cyber-attack. There was no immediate official comment, and the websites of the main state oil company NIOC appeared to be functioning normally. Residents said their internet access was not affected.\n\nNetBlocks, an organisation that monitors internet connectivity, reported \u201cintermittent disruptions\u201d to some internet services in Iran starting on Friday evening.\n\nBut the group said the impact was limited, affecting only specific providers, and the cause was unclear. \u201cData are consistent with a cyber-attack or unplanned technical incident on affected networks as opposed to a purposeful withdrawal or shutdown incident,\u201d it said in a tweet.\n\nNetBlocks Director Alp Toker said they saw four Iranian networks falling offline over a three hour period on Friday evening. This began when the first reports emerged and ended shortly afterwards. The networks have been stable since.\n\nThe fresh sanctions target the Central Bank of Iran, which was already under U.S. sanctions, the National Development Fund of Iran - the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund - and an Iranian company that U.S. officials say is used to conceal financial transfers for Iranian military purchases.\n\nZarif said he would on Wednesday meet foreign ministers of the remaining signatories to the 2015 nuclear accord, which was agreed with Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia as well as the United States.\n\nIran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif reacts during a news conference with Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (not pictured) after their meeting in Moscow, Russia, September 2, 2019.
