Crucially, scientists reported on Monday, it accomplishes all that without making genome-scrambling cuts in the double helix, as classic CRISPR and many of its offshoots do.\n\nNews about this \u201cprime editing\u201d began circulating among CRISPR-ites this month, when the inventors unveiled it at a meeting at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Since then, \u201cthe excitement has been palpable,\u201d said genetic engineer Fyodor Urnov of the University of California, Berkeley, who was not involved in the research.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t overstate the significance of this,\u201d he said, likening the creation of ever-more kinds of genome-editing technologies to the creation of superheroes with different powers: \u201cThis could be quite a useful Avenger for the genome-editing community, especially in translating basic research to the clinic\u201d to cure diseases ranging from sickle cell to cystic fibrosis.\n\nadvertisement\n\nPrime editing\u2019s inventors, led by David Liu of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and postdoctoral fellow Dr. Andrew Anzalone, say it has the potential to correct 89% of known disease-causing genetic variations in DNA, from the single-letter misspelling that causes sickle cell to the superfluous four letters that cause Tay-Sachs disease. All told, they report making 175 edits in human and mouse cells.\n\n\u201cThere are more than 75,000 DNA changes associated with genetic diseases,\u201d Liu told reporters ahead of the online publication in Nature describing prime editors. \u201cCollectively, they cover all of these.\u201d\n\nPrime editing improves on CRISPR-Cas9 (and all of the tweaks researchers have made to it in the last seven years) in several crucial ways, Liu said. It can change any of DNA\u2019s four nucleotides, or \u201cletters\u201d \u2014 denoted A, T, C, and G \u2014 into any other, a total of 12 possibilities.\n\nOne of Liu\u2019s earlier CRISPR inventions, called base editing, can make only four of those changes: C-to-T, T-to-C, A-to-G, and G-to-A. It cannot, for instance, correct the sickle-cell-causing mutation in the hemoglobin gene, which requires changing a T to an A at a precise spot.\n\n\u201cPrime editing,\u201d Urnov said, \u201cis excellent for the repair of [such] point mutations,\u201d which are the cause of some 7,000 inherited genetic diseases.\n\nUnlike other forms of CRISPR, prime editors easily make those repairs in non-dividing cells such as neurons and muscle cells, which genome-editing researchers are eyeing as targets for treating diseases ranging from Duchenne muscular dystrophy to Rett syndrome.\n\nIn addition to changing one nucleotide to another, prime editors can remove a precise number of nucleotides from a precise spot in the genome. For instance, the Broad scientists removed (from human cells growing in lab dishes) the four nucleotides in the gene HEXA that cause Tay-Sachs disease. Elsewhere, they were able to remove as many as 80.\n\n\u201cIt looks like prime editing will offer some new capabilities to the genome editing community,\u201d said biochemist Benjamin Kleinstiver of Massachusetts General Hospital, whose research centers on turning genome editing into \u201cmolecular medicine.\u201d\n\nMost impressive to other scientists is prime editing\u2019s ability to insert missing nucleotides or replace a string of disease-causing ones with nucleotides supplied by CRISPR. Liu and his colleagues inserted as many as 44, a quantity he says they were \u201cskeptical\u201d of achieving. Now, however, he believes \u201cit\u2019s likely that larger insertions, and deletions [greater than 80], would be possible.\u201d\n\nIn classic CRISPR, genome editing begins when the Cas9 enzyme cuts DNA at a site to which a target-finding molecule, called guide RNA, led it. That triggers DNA\u2019s natural repair machinery, which can respond in several ways: mending the break by knitting the two loose ends together; filling the gap with nucleotides randomly grabbed from the cell; or patching the break with a piece of repair DNA supplied by scientists. It turns out that cells much prefer the first and second options. That has made the third, called homology-directed repair, very difficult \u2014 a real problem since curing many genetic diseases would require this kind of fix.\n\nPrime editing\u2019s ability to get human genomes to accept a repair template was therefore particularly impressive to other scientists, since \u201cno one has found a good way to do it,\u201d Urnov said. In a study that rocked the genome-editing world, for instance, scientists reported in 2017 that human embryos with a gene that causes the heart disease hypertrophic cardiomyopathy rejected the healthy gene that was introduced via CRISPR. Yet using CRISPR to cure cardiomyopathy and some other inherited genetic diseases would likely require homology-directed repair.\n\nPrime editing \u201cworks for a whole range of nucleotide changes that may be necessary to correct disease genes,\u201d said Maria Jasin of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, an expert in DNA repair. \u201cIt is a meaningful advance.\u201d\n\nNewsletters Sign up for The Readout Your daily guide to what\u2019s happening in biotech.

A guide RNA, which the Liu team calls pegRNA (where \u201cpe\u201d stands for prime editing), makes a beeline for a pre-programmed spot on the genome. The pegRNA also contains nucleotides that will substitute for the disease-causing ones in the DNA target. The second component, a hobbled Cas9 enzyme, cuts one, but not both, strands of the DNA. The third component, an enzyme called reverse transcriptase that\u2019s fused to Cas9, copies the RNA nucleotides carried by the pegRNA and transforms them into DNA nucleotides, which replace those at the target site.\n\n\u201cThe net result is a permanent edit that has been copied from the information encoded in the pegRNA,\u201d Liu said. As for versatility, he and his colleagues used the prime editor to, in one case, precisely delete two DNA nucleotides and, at the same time, convert a G into a T five letters away, \u201call in one edit\u201d \u2014 the genome equivalent of a pool shark\u2019s banking the 9 ball off the 7 and sinking the 1, 5, and 6.\n\nSo far, Liu\u2019s team has tested the prime editor on human cells and on mouse neurons. In both, the rate at which unintended spots in the genome were edited was extremely low: rates of such off-target edits were below 10%. Efficiency was high, typically 20% to 50%, depending on the kind of edit, and as high as 78%. Other CRISPR systems struggle to get into the double digits. And only 1% to 10% of prime-edited cells had unwanted insertions or deletions (\u201cindels\u201d) of nucleotides, compared to upwards of 90% for some older CRISPR systems.\n\nBecause indels could trigger cancer or other genomic havoc, \u201cavoiding indels in certain gene therapy applications is certainly a big deal,\u201d Jasin said.\n\nOne concern that she and other outside scientists raised is that the human cells used to test the prime editor come from cancer. Although this cell line has been used for decades for many non-cancer experiments, it might not be representative of how well the prime editor will do in other human cells. \u201cMore work needs to be done in other cell types,\u201d Jasin said.\n\nThe Broad has applied for a patent on prime editing, and is already making it freely available to academic and non-profit researchers for non-commercial uses, without requiring a license. Companies may license the technology non-exclusively for research and manufacturing, including for agriculture. But it has given an exclusive license for the commercial development of human therapeutics to Prime Medicine, a new company co-founded by Liu.\n\nFor all their versatility, it\u2019s far from a given that prime editors will take over the CRISPR landscape. For both basic research and therapeutic uses, classic CRISPR (where the intellectual property ownership is spread around broadly) might work just fine. For instance, treating sickle cell requires that a mere 10% of red blood cells have healthy hemoglobin, which seems well within the reach of classic CRISPR.\n\nSimilarly, if the clinical trials currently underway using first-generation CRISPR technology to treat a form of congenital blindness (by Editas Medicine) and sickle cell (by CRISPR Therapeutics) succeed, there is no reason to think they\u2019ll be superseded by prime editing. And Beam Therapeutics, which is developing therapies using base editing and has announced plans to go public (and which Liu also co-founded), could well find that that approach works for the diseases it eventually decides to target. It is also sub-licensing rights to prime editing from Prime Medicine.\n\nDr. Matthew Porteus of Stanford University, who is leading a clinical trial using CRISPR to cure sickle cell, cautioned that whether prime editing can \u201csolve a problem that can\u2019t be solved by [classic CRISPR] remains to be determined.\u201d", "description": "The tool can precisely change any of DNA\u2019s \u201cletters\u201d into any other and insert or delete any stretch of DNA \u2014 all more efficiently than previous CRISPR.", "authors": ["Sharon Begley", "Shraddha Chakradhar", "Olga Dobrovidova"], "top_image": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AdobeStock_154392349-1024x576.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
