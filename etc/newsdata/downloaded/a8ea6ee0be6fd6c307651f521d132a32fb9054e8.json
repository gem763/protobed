We have control of everything in your city. We also compromised all passwords and sensitive data such as finance and personal population information,\" the note said.\n\nAuthorities responded by shutting down all the IT infrastructure, such as websites, payment portals, and other e-services. A breach was later confirmed via the city's official Twitter account.\n\nThis is the second time in the past four months that the city's network was hit by ransomware. In July, hackers installed ransomware on the city power provider's network, leaving some residents without electricity for days.\n\n\n\nThe City has detected a network breach in its systems ^TK pic.twitter.com/r43iiJiUya \u2014 City of Joburg (@CityofJoburgZA) October 24, 2019\n\n\u2139Advisory\u2139\n\n\n\nDue to the impact of the compromise of the @CityofJoburgZA network, residents are advised to dial the following numbers in an emergency:\n\n\n\nCellphone: 112\n\nLandline: 10177 pic.twitter.com/8EMj6ixZCv \u2014 Joburg Public Safety (@CoJPublicSafety) October 25, 2019\n\nLocal media also reported that at the same time, several South African banks were hit by cyber-attacks attacks, and their services went down. Standard Bank and Absa were two of the five banks that were attacked by what appeared to be DDoS attacks.\n\nIt is unclear if the attacks on the banks were carried out by the same Shadow Kill Hackers group.\n\nAs ZDNet reported yesterday, over the past week, financial institutions across the world have been getting hit by DDoS attacks and extortion demands. South Africa was one of the countries affected by these attacks, according to a spokesperson from Group-IB, a cyber-security firm that provides security services to financial institutions. The attacks on the South African banks might be a coincidence happening at the same time with the attack on the Johannesburg municipality's network.\n\nArticle updated shortly after publication to reflect that this is a ransomware incident, and not a data breach, as initial evidence suggested.", "description": "South Africa's largest city falls prey to ransomware for the second time in four months.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/25/ce60a13e-6409-4d35-919c-8f96fee02191/thumbnail/770x578/b566028f0fcd972949f98990ecce303d/johannesburg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
