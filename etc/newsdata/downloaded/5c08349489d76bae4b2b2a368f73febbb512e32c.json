The way items were taken also resembled each other. .\n\nAnd the means used to get away were about the same: bicycles and a scooter.\n\nWith the increased availability of shared bicycles and shared scooters, an increasing number of anecdotal accounts of crimes seem to include such items in their description of events.\n\nFew ever duplicate each other precisely. Although the two robberies reported Saturday had much in common, they were not identical.\n\nIn what appeared to be one of the two latest of the three, a teenager on a bicycle snatched property at Florida and West Virginia Avenues NW, a crossroads near Gallaudet University, police said. They said the teenage robber wore a black hooded sweatshirt and was riding \u201ca dark bicycle.\u201d\n\nAround that time police said, the victim was seated outdoors in the 1000 block of H Street NE, in the prominent entertainment corridor, around 7 p.m. when someone came along and \u201csnatched his iPhone from his hand,\u201d the police said.\n\nThen police said, the robber rode off \u201con a Capital Bikeshare bike.Police said the robber appeared to be from 18 to 24, black and male. He wore a dark grey hoodie or jersey, the police said.\n\nIn the first of the Saturday snatch robberies, which occurred at about 5 p.m., the location was the 1300 block of East Capitol Street NE, at the eastern edge of Capitol Hill.\n\nIn that robbery, the victim, described as a juvenile, was walking with his mother. He, too, held his phone in his hand, police said. It, too, was snatched away, according to a police account.\n\nIn that incident, police said, they were looking for five black male youths, one on a scooter and the others on bicycles. Police said they were described as from 13 to 15 years old. The youth on the scooter wore a camouflage hoodie, police said. They said the others wore colorful hoodies.\n\nDescriptions had general similarities, but differed among the three incidents, and it was unclear whether any of the same robbers were involved.\n\nAccording to preliminary information from police, that robbery involved four black male teenagers, in all-black closing, including black hooded sweatshirts. The account made no mention of bicycles.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Incidents occurred in prominent spots, and in at least two cases phones were taken.", "authors": ["Martin Weil", "Local Reporter", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/IgoCOOj7iQFQ0ZmhcSovmCIwodI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FQ7QY6FHAEI6RLLPBADXBXG5YI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
