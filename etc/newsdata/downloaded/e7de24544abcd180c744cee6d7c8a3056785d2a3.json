No heat is allowed in to keep the products at the same temperature.\n\n\"If you end up in such a box with 39 people, you're going to die.\"\n\nJoachim Coens, chief executive of Zeebrugge port, said it was unlikely people were loaded into the container at the Belgian port.\n\nHe told Flemish TV channel VRT: \"A refrigerated container in the port zone is completely sealed. During the check, the seal is examined, as is the licence plate.\n\n\"The vehicle is checked by cameras.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe lorry and trailer left Purfleet shortly after 1.05am and officers were called around 30 minutes later after ambulance staff made the discovery at Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays, Essex.\n\nThe lorry driver Mo Robinson is reported to have passed out when he opened the doors to fetch some paperwork and discovered the bodies, a horrified witness told the Evening Standard.\n\nHe remains in police custody having been arrested on suspicion of murder.\n\nThe witness' claims have not been confirmed by Essex Police, who have been granted an extra 24 hours to question Robinson after he was arrested at 1.40am on Wednesday.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nOne friend told Mail Online: \"When he opened the container up and saw all the dead bodies, he was absolutely horrified - as anyone would be - and called the ambulance service who in turn alerted the police.\n\n\"I heard the container was refrigerated - the temperature was -25 degrees and the bodies were frozen and had been dead for some time.\"\n\nEssex Police have reported all the 39 victims - including a teenager - are from China. They said eight of the victims were women and the remaining 31 men.\n\nBodies are now being moved by private ambulance with a police escort from Tilbury Docks to Broomfield Hospital so post-mortem examinations can be carried out.\n\nThe horror has chilling echoes of 2000, when 58 Chinese stowaways died in a lorry travelling by ferry from Belgium to Britain.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nIn both tragedies, the victims had come from Zeebrugge in to Purfleet port in Essex.\n\nRobinson, who has been a HGV driver for more than five years, doesn't own the lorry.\n\nThe lorry was registered in Varna, Bulgaria, in 2017 by an Irish company but has not returned to Bulgaria since then.", "description": "The mayor of Zeebrugge insists the Chinese migrants were dead before they arrived at the Belgian port town and transported to Purfleet", "authors": ["Tom Davidson", "Image", "Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20716429.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Police-officers-in-a-forensic-suits-are-photographed-at-the-scene-with-a-lorry.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
