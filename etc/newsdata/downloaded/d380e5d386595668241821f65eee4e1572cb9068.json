These dogs are a special breed of courageous.\u201d\n\nNeither President Trump nor the Department of Defense (D0D) has released additional details regarding the canine soldier, but retired Marine Ron Aiello told the New York Times that the dog was either a Belgian Malinois or German Shepherd.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re leading the patrol, they want a dog that is not only an explosive detection dog but on command can be aggressive,\u201d said Aiello. \u201cOn a mission like this you want a dog that can be aggressive when necessary.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, U.S. Navy SEALs similarly used a dog during the raid on Osama bin Laden\u2019s secret compound in 2011, which resulted in the Taliban leader\u2019s death.\n\nOffering more details about this weekend\u2019s raid, President Trump said al-Baghdadi fled from U.S. military personnel during the operation and detonated a suicide vest in a dead-end tunnel, killing himself and three children.\n\nAn on-site DNA test confirmed al-Baghdadi\u2019s identity.\n\n\u201cHe was whimpering, screaming and crying, and frankly, I think it\u2019s something that should be brought out so that his followers and all of these young kids that want to leave various countries \u2013 including the United States \u2013 they should see how he died,\u201d the president said of the now-dead terror chief. \u201cHe didn\u2019t die a hero, he died a coward \u2013 crying, whimpering, and screaming and bringing three kids with him to die. Certain death.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo personnel were lost in the operation,\u201d Trump added, \u201cwhile a large number of Baghdadi\u2019s fighters and companions were killed with him.\u201d\n\nThe UPI contributed to this report.", "description": "A heroic dog that was injured during the U.S. military operation that killed\u00a0ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has already returned to duty.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-123423260-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
