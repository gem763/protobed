Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Ben Cardin (D-MD), and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) outlined their concerns in a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and FBI Director James Comey. Brown, Cardin, and Feinstein are the top Democrats on the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, and the Judiciary Committee, respectively.\n\nThe Senators\u2019 concerns stem from a recent New Yorker investigative article \u2013 \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s Worst Deal\u201d \u2013 that chronicles the Trump Organization\u2019s relationship with Azerbaijan\u2019s corrupt Mammadov family in their joint development of the Trump Tower in Baku. According to the article, the Mammadovs have ties to IRGC actors; the IRGC is an elite military force that wields significant economic and political power in Iran.\n\nIn their letter, the Senators said the article raises questions about whether the Trump Organization may have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and the possibility that one of the construction entities involved with the Azerbaijani developers of the project may have been a front organization for the IRGC. According to the article, the IRGC may have been the ultimate source of certain payments made to the Trump Organization, which would be a direct violation of US sanctions law.\n\n\u201cIt appears that the lack of due diligence by the Trump Organization described in the article exposed President Trump and his organization to notoriously corrupt Azerbaijani oligarchs, and may also have exposed the Trump Organization to the IRGC,\u201d the Senators wrote. \u201cEven though the Trump Organization appears to have withdrawn from the Baku Tower deal, serious questions remain unanswered about the Trump Organization\u2019s potential criminal liability.\u201d\n\nThe Senators asked the Justice Department to investigate whether the Trump Organization violated anti-corruption laws by failing to conduct due diligence in its relationship with the Mammadovs. The Senators also asked the agency to determine whether the company acted with \"willful blindness\" regarding its business partners' illicit activity in the Baku dealings, and whether the Trump Organization could face criminal prosecution. If the Justice Department finds that an investigation is not needed, the Senators wrote, the agency needs to explain why not.\n\nThe Senators also asked Treasury to examine the Trump Organization\u2019s foreign partners in the Baku deal, its internal compliance controls, and whether the company may have violated sanctions laws by doing business with those linked to the IRGC.\n\nBrown, Cardin, and Feinstein have consistently asked for more transparency and accountability from Trump, who has refused to disclose his business dealings and divest from investments that pose potential conflicts of interest. The Senators are cosponsors of legislation that would require the President and Vice President to disclose and divest any potential financial conflicts of interest.\n\nThe full text of the letter follows.\n\nMarch 30, 2017\n\nThe Honorable James B. Comey, Jr. The Honorable Jeff Sessions\n\nDirector Attorney General of the United States\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation US Department of Justice\n\n935 Pennsylvania Avenue NW 950 Pennsylvania Avenue NW\n\nWashington, D.C. 20535 Washington, D.C. 20535\n\nSecretary Steven T. Mnuchin\n\nU.S. Department of the Treasury\n\n1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW\n\nWashington, D.C. 20220\n\nDear Secretary Mnuchin, Attorney General Sessions, and Director Comey:\n\nWe are writing to express serious concerns about the questions raised by a March 13, 2017 New Yorker magazine article by Adam Davidson entitled, \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s Worst Deal.\u201d We urge you to investigate the questions it raises about: 1) potential violations by the Trump Organization of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA); 2) the possibility that one of the construction entities involved with the developers of the project may have been an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) front organization; and 3) whether the IRGC may have been the ultimate source of certain payments made to the Trump Organization, which would constitute a clear violation of US sanctions law.\n\nMr. Davidson\u2019s article chronicles the Trump Organization\u2019s relationship with Azerbaijan\u2019s Mammadov family in their joint development of the Trump Tower in Baku. It appears that the lack of due diligence by the Trump Organization described in the article exposed President Trump and his organization to notoriously corrupt Azerbaijani oligarchs, and may also have exposed the Trump Organization to the IRGC. Even though the Trump Organization appears to have withdrawn from the Baku Tower deal, serious questions remain unanswered about the Trump Organization\u2019s potential criminal liability. Therefore, we would appreciate your response to the following questions regarding the laws under your enforcement purview.\n\nDepartment of Justice\n\nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) was enacted to establish anti-corruption controls for business dealings with foreign officials. Since the business relationships described in the Davidson article could involve violations of the FCPA, we urge the Department to assess whether any violations of law occurred. In particular, we ask that you determine the following:\n\nWhether the Trump Organization failed to conduct appropriate FCPA due diligence in assessing business relationships with the Mammadov family (including Ziya Mammadov, the Azeri Minister of Transportation who is a billionaire despite a reported government salary of $12,000 annually) and prospects for the Trump Tower project, involving Ziya\u2019s son Anar, and Ziya\u2019s brother Elton Mammadov, an influential Member of Parliament. Such failures may constitute potential FCPA violations. Whether the Trump Organization acted with willful blindness regarding its business partners\u2019 illicit acts in the Trump Tower Baku dealings, including the Mammadov family, and whether the Trump Organization could face criminal prosecution. If the Justice Department determines that no investigation is necessary please explain why not.\n\nDepartment of the Treasury\n\nMr. Davidson\u2019s article details the relationships that exist between the Mammadov family and the IRGC, and between what is described as a possible IRGC-controlled construction firm (the Azarpassillo firm) and the Mammadovs, and the Trump Organization. These relationships raise serious questions about whether the Trump Organization may have become entangled with an IRGC front organization in violation of U.S. sanctions. We urge you to investigate the Trump Organization\u2019s foreign partners in the Trump Tower Baku deal, as well as the internal controls of the Trump Organization, and provide us with your conclusions, where appropriate. In particular:\n\nWe request a briefing, in coordination with the Director of National Intelligence, on any relationship between the Mammadov family and the IRGC, as well as the Mammadov family\u2019s relationship to the Azarpassillo firm, its chairman Keyumars Darvishi, and his family, and their relationship to the IRGC. We ask you to direct the Office of Foreign Assets Control to open an investigation into whether the Trump Organization maintained proper compliance controls in this case, and to assess whether or not the Trump Organization violated US sanctions law by conducting transactional activity with a group linked to the IRGC.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to hearing from you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSherrod Brown, Ranking Member\n\nCommittee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs\n\nBen Cardin, Ranking Member\n\nCommittee on Foreign Relations\n\nDianne Feinstein, Ranking Member\n\nCommittee on the Judiciary\n\ncc: Mike Piwowar, Acting Chairman, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n\n###\n\nPress Contact\n\nSean Bartlett, 202.224.4651", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.foreign.senate.gov/themes/foreign/images/sharelogo.jpg", "published_at": "2017-03-30"}
