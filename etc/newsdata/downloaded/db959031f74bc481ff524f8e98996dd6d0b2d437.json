Rising e- and m-commerce, surges in mobile P2P, and increasing willingness among customers in developed countries to try new transaction channels, like mobile in-store payments, voice and chatbot payments, or connected device payments are all increasing transaction touchpoints for providers. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nThis is helping payments become seamless, allowing firms to boost adoption, build and strengthen relationships, offer more services, and increase usage.\n\nBut payment ubiquity and invisibility also comes with challenges. Regulatory changes and geopolitical tensions are forcing players to reevaluate their approach to scale. And fraudsters are more aggressively exploiting vulnerabilities, making data breaches feel almost inevitable and pushing providers to improve their defenses and crisis response capabilities alike.\n\nThe Payments Industry Explained\n\nIn the latest annual edition of The Payments Ecosystem Report, Business Insider Intelligence unpacks the current digital payments ecosystem, and explores how changes will impact the industry in both the short- and long-term. The report traces the path of an in-store card payment from processing to settlement to clarify the role of key stakeholders and assess how the landscape has shifted.\n\nIt uses forecasts, case studies, and product developments from the past year to explain how digital transformation is impacting major payment processing industry segments and evaluate the pace of change. Finally, it highlights five trends that should shape the payments industry in the year ahead, looking at how regulatory shifts, emerging technologies, and competition could impact the payments ecosystem.\n\nHere are some key takeaways from the report:\n\nBehind the scenes, payment processes and stakeholders remain similar. But providers are forced to make payments as frictionless as possible as online shopping surges: E-commerce is poised to exceed $1 trillion \u2014 nearly a fifth of total US retail \u2014 by 2023.\n\nThe channels and front-end methods that consumers use to make payments are evolving. Mobile in-store payments are huge in developing markets, but approaching an inflection point in developed regions where adoption has been laggy. And the ubiquity of mobile P2P services like Venmo and Square Cash will propel digital P2P to $574 billion by 2023.\n\nThe competitive payments industry landscape will shift as companies pursue joint ventures to grow abroad in response to geopolitical tensions, or consolidate to achieve rapid scale amid digitization.\n\nFees, bans, steering, or regulation could impact the way consumers pay, pushing them toward emerging methods that bypass card rails, and limit key revenue sources that providers use to fund rewards and marketing initiatives.\n\nTokenization will continue to mainstream as a key way providers are preventing and responding to the omnipresent data breach threat.\n\nIn full, the report:\n\nExplains the factors contributing to a swell in global noncash payments\n\nExamines shifts in the roles of major industry stakeholders, including issuers, card networks, acquirer-processors, POS terminal vendors, and gateways\n\nPresents forecasts and highlights major trends and payments events driving digital payments growth\n\nIdentifies five trends that will shape the payments industry ecosystem in the year ahead\n\nInterested in getting the full report?
