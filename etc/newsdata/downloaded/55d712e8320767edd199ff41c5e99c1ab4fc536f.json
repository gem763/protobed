The same back division (significantly?) began the last \u201cfirst team\u201d clash with Italy, won 49-3.\n\nUnfortunately, certain of the reserves that day - Nyakane and Kriel - have since flown home due to injury, while there were some doubts about a swollen knee afflicting seasoned, adaptable loose forward Louw ahead of Sunday\u2019s big clash.\n\nIt also appears as if Erasmus has slightly revised, as the tournament has progressed, his \u201cpriority\u201d list in some of the engine-room berths, where Mbonambi could be viewed as now having leapfrogged Marx at hooker, Lood de Jager squeezing out Mostert at No 5 lock, and Mtawarira doing likewise to Kitshoff at loosehead prop.\n\nThat was his \u201cItaly\u201d pack recently, and it was a mightily efficient unit in sucking the life out of the Azzurri\u2019s eight \u2026 to the extent that those Bok troops could feasibly be retained en masse.\n\nBut Erasmus, a meticulous planner, is also not averse to making at least some horses-for-courses tweaks to suit needs when it comes to specific opponents and their varying styles of play, while he has spoken, too, about how weather conditions have changed - cooler, notably less humid, apparently - in Japan as the event has progressed.\n\nOne or two minor curveballs, then, are possible in his team announcement, even as a broad theme of consistency will still run through the line-up in overall terms.\n\nSmartest bet? I\u2019m going to venture the status quo for Erasmus\u2019s \u201cbig matches\u201d backline, but a fielding of that forward unit - discussed above - that ran out against Italy.\n\nThere will be some close, debatable calls, but that\u2019s usually no bad thing, and a reflection of the heat of competition within the present Bok party for places.\n\n*Follow our chief writer on Twitter: @RobHouwing", "description": "Just how devotedly the Boks stick to the personnel who trounced Japan a few weeks ago will be an intriguing feature of their RWC quarter-final team, says <strong>Rob Houwing</strong>.", "authors": ["Rob Houwing - Chief Writer"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9479/e56f852d003e47548e8a07c8da0e3449.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
