So when he learned the online retail giant had poured $1 million into remaking the Seattle City Council with more business-friendly candidates, he pulled out his wallet.\n\nThe New York resident sent $15 to socialist council member Kshama Sawant, a target of the online retail giant. While that doesn\u2019t compare to Amazon\u2019s unprecedented spending Oct. 14, about 1,900 others also have donated to Sawant since then, her campaign says. It\u2019s a dramatic rise in support and a reflection of the risk Amazon is taking as it splashes into the politics of its liberal hometown.\n\nMany in Seattle aren\u2019t happy with the council, but they also may not like a company headed by the world\u2019s richest man, Jeff Bezos, trying to influence their vote. As historic income inequality fuels homelessness and soaring housing prices, some progressives elsewhere don\u2019t like it either.\n\n\u201cAmazon could do this in hundreds of places around the country with all the money they\u2019re not paying in taxes,\u201d said Sweeney, a 28-year-old software engineer turned carpenter in Valley Stream, New York.\n\nWith seven of the nine Seattle council seats in play Nov. 5, business interests see an opportunity to shift city leadership closer to the political center and away from a bent to potentially tax big companies to fund homeless services or improve public transit.\n\nThe council is officially nonpartisan, but Republicans stand little chance of getting elected in Seattle, and many of the business-backed candidates are moderate to progressive Democrats. The race will decide whether the council is dominated by socialists and extremely liberal Democrats or more centrist ones.\n\n\u201cWe are contributing to this election because we care deeply about the future of Seattle,\u201d Amazon spokesman Aaron Toso said in a statement. \u201cWe believe it is critical that our hometown has a City Council that is focused on pragmatic solutions to our shared challenges in transportation, homelessness, climate change and public safety.\u201d\n\nProgressive Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are among those accusing Amazon of trying to buy the council.\n\nThe elections come a year after a political debacle that damaged the council\u2019s popularity. The leaders unanimously passed the \u201cAmazon tax,\u201d designed to make lucrative companies contribute more to affordable housing for the homeless.\n\nIt repealed the tax after a revolt from Amazon, which would have had to pay around $11 million a year and threatened to halt its growth in the city. The company said Seattle didn\u2019t need more money and that it was \u201chighly uncertain whether the City Council\u2019s anti-business positions or its spending inefficiency will change for the better.\u201d\n\nThe debate helped cement Amazon\u2019s awakening to local politics as the council\u2019s popularity slipped, especially over its handling of homelessness. Four council members decided not to seek re-election.\n\nThere\u2019s been little progress in the four years since the city declared a homelessness crisis. Many business interests support \u201csweeps\u201d of homeless camps accompanied by teams to help people get services.\n\nLiberal council members, including Sawant, say the sweeps are inhumane and don\u2019t work. She wants money for tiny-house villages.\n\nMeanwhile, some in Sawant\u2019s district say she\u2019s more interested in building a national socialist movement than responding to their concerns. A large portion of her donations come from out of state.\n\nSawant helped make Seattle the first big city to adopt a $15-an-hour minimum wage. She frequently says people must choose sides in \u201cclass warfare\u201d and has warned that a win by Amazon would embolden corporate interests to fight efforts to make the rich pay more in taxes or spread progressive policies like tenants\u2019 rights and paid sick leave laws.\n\nThe two liberal, vocally pro-union council members who are not up for re-election, Teresa Mosqueda and Lorena Gonz\u00e1les, didn\u2019t endorse Sawant in the primary.\n\nBut after Amazon weighed in, both enthusiastically endorsed her last week. She\u2019s running against Egan Orion, director of an annual gay pride festival in Seattle.\n\nGonz\u00e1les said Amazon\u2019s support might swing Orion\u2019s positions.\n\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s that much money being offered, there will be a quid-pro-quo expectation,\u201d she said. \u201cAmazon has plenty of access to the council already. What they want is elected officials who are going to bend to their will.\u201d\n\nAt a recent debate, Orion pointed to his work in the LGBTQ community and with small businesses, saying, \u201cThat narrative does not match the person that I am or the way I am running this campaign.\u201d\n\nHe describes himself as a progressive but says more can be accomplished by negotiating with business leaders than by demonizing them.\n\nAmazon gave $1 million this month to the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce\u2019s political action committee, bringing its total contributions to the PAC this year to $1.5 million \u2014 a huge amount for a local election. Starbucks, Expedia and a development company started by late Microsoft founder Paul Allen also have contributed.\n\n\u201cGenerally, folks have seen a council that talks a lot about progress on homelessness, on reducing traffic, on helping with our increasingly unaffordable housing stock, and they really just haven\u2019t seen progress,\u201d PAC executive director Markham McIntyre said. \u201cWith taxes going up year after year, they get frustrated when they\u2019re not seeing results.\u201d\n\nSo far, independent spending in the council races has reached more than $3.5 million.\n\nLabor groups also are spending heavily, including Civic Alliance for a Progressive Economy, which is backed by progressive Amazon investor Nick Hanauer and has raised nearly $500,000. The PAC of the hotel workers union Unite Here has raised even more.\n\nState Sen. Reuven Carlyle, a Seattle Democrat, said he didn\u2019t know what effect Amazon\u2019s spending will have on the election but that he understood its desire to \u201crebalance\u201d the council.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re showing that they care a lot about their hometown, just as labor cares a lot and social justice activists care a lot,\u201d Carlyle said.", "description": "SEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Brian Sweeney has a long list of complaints about Amazon, from the way it treats warehouse workers to the low taxes it pays and its effort", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/29/af77a5_amazon-city-council-spending-48076-in-wednesday-oct-23-2019-photo-campaign-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
