He began by talking about just how \u201csuper-sized\u201d the night was with 12 candidates on stage.\n\n\u201cCandidates aren\u2019t supposed to multiply as the debates go on,\u201d Noah said. \u201cSo, please, America, remember to have your candidate spayed or neutered, we can\u2019t handle any more!\u201d\n\nAfter briefly touching on the mostly conflict-free impeachment discussion, the host tackled former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s answer to questions about his son Hunter\u2019s business dealings with foreign companies. \u201cI think I get where he was going, but it took a while for him to get there,\u201d Noah said.\n\nBiden insisted that his son \u201cdid nothing wrong\u201d despite the fact that Hunter acknowledged his own \u201cpoor judgment\u201d in an interview with ABC News earlier that morning. Biden then quickly pivoted to make a point about George Washington.\n\n\u201cOK, one minute he\u2019s talking about his son, then George Washington, then something about the seventeenth?\u201d Noah said, attempting to recap the bizarre answer. \u201cJoe Biden is the only candidate who remixes his speech while he\u2019s giving it,\u201d Noah added, imitating the vice president\u2019s odd vocal tics.\n\nLater, moving on to the foreign policy section of the debate, Noah jokingly went after Biden for calling Donald Trump an \u201cerratic, crazy president who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHold on, you may not like Donald Trump but you can\u2019t say he doesn\u2019t know a damn thing about foreign policy,\u201d the host said. \u201cUnlike Trump, not one of these Democrats has calculated the country of Nambia on their health care system. And maybe because there\u2019s no country called Nambia, but that\u2019s not the point. The point is not one of you can find it on a map!\u201d\n\nNoah also found time to mock the debate\u2019s moderators for the way they asked about Bernie Sanders\u2019 recent heart attack, but then asked several other candidates age-related questions to make it seem less awkward. That included a question for Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) about potentially being the youngest president ever elected.\n\n\u201cI get the part about asking people about being too old, but asking Tulsi Gabbard about being too young? Is that really a concern?\u201d he asked. \u201c\u2018Tulsi, are you too fit and vibrant for the presidency? Is it possible you might die of young age?\u2019\u201d\n\nBut the \u201cweirdest part\u201d of the night, Noah said, was when Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) \u201cstarted a real-life Twitter beef\u201d with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) over Twitter\u2019s refusal to ban Trump from its platform.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I kind of understand Warren\u2019s point here,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe need Trump on Twitter. It\u2019s the only way we can monitor what he\u2019s up to. Otherwise he\u2019s doing that shit in secret. You\u2019ve got to think of Twitter as a presidential baby monitor. The whole time you\u2019re looking, you\u2019re like, \u2018Hold on, he\u2019s awake and wants to nuke a hurricane, I gotta go!\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd finally, Noah zeroed in on the biggest theme of the night: Everyone attacking de-facto frontrunner Warren. After playing a montage of the hits on the Massachusetts senator, he said, \u201cDamn, Elizabeth Warren might have an even bigger target on her back now than Joe Biden.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it makes sense,\u201d he continued. \u201cI mean, she\u2019s risen to the top of the polls and, now, her competitors have their sights set on her. And that really was the big takeaway of tonight. They\u2019re coming for you, Elizabeth. And all I can say is, I hope you\u2019ve got a plan for that.\u201d", "description": "In his live post-debate show, \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d host also declared Elizabeth Warren the indisputable new frontrunner in the race.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571198009/TN_58_yqalsf", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
