There are Japanese three-Michelin star restaurants that are doing tempura, that are specialising in amazing pieces of fish that are deep fried and served and cost the earth.\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t we get the best fish in the world and create the best batter, deep fry it and serve it with amazing potatoes?\u201d\n\nHis dish comes with a fruity Matson sauce, named in honour of the curry sauce he remembers having as a child from his local chippy, now closed, on the Matson estate in Gloucester.\n\nFront-of-house staff often tell diners it is named after a Gloucester estate. They don\u2019t imagine the type of estate he means, he said: one \u201cwith swings that haven\u2019t got the swing bit over it\u201d.\n\nKerridge added: \u201cOprah Winfrey was in a few weeks ago and she had Matson sauce. I love the fact Oprah Winfrey has had fish and chips with Matson sauce. She knows Matson.\u201d\n\nKerridge has done a lot in his books and on television to demystify cooking. He told the festival it was good to have a microwave in any home kitchen and fine to use stock cubes.\n\nHe also gave the audience a potentially life-changing tip: roast your mince.\n\nMost people making a bolognese sauce will chop and fry onions and garlic, add some dried herbs and \u201cthrow in a packet of mince, stir it around until it goes a bit grey and all that water comes out of it\u201d.\n\nInstead, he said, put the mince on a roasting tray for an hour in the oven, stirring occasionally. \u201cTexturally, it is amazing. It goes really dry and crunchy and you put it in the stock and tomatoes it rehydrates but it still has this lovely texture. The flavour is massive,\u201d Kerridge told the festival.", "description": "Tom Kerridge tells Cheltenham literature festival his dish uses \u2018incredibly expensive\u2019 potatoes", "authors": ["Mark Brown"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d3c1b5cb3dc498ff25a5a1177f4f3fa7bd0c620/0_92_4668_2801/master/4668.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=843e3b6ac1fe142245030715587acbb5", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
