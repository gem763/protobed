But resistance is stirring | Stefan Bielik Read more\n\nThere was elation at the party\u2019s headquarters as the exit poll was projected on a big screen, with supporters chanting the name of Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, the party\u2019s founder and leader, who has in effect run Poland from his party office since Law and Justice took power four years ago.\n\n\u201cWe have reasons to be joyful \u2013 despite the powerful front that was arraigned against us, we were able to win,\u201d said Kaczy\u0144ski. \u201cI hope that tomorrow will bring confirmation of our success. We have four years of hard work in front of us, because Poland needs to change further. And it must change for the better.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday the sun shone as it rarely does in October,\u201d said Mateusz Morawiecki, Poland\u2019s prime minister and a Kaczy\u0144ski nominee. \u201cAnd I hope tomorrow it will shine even brighter. These results give us a huge public mandate.\u201d\n\nAlso buoyant were supporters of Lewica, a coalition of leftwing parties that, according to the exit poll, received 11.9% of the vote, translating to 43 seats. The result would mark a return of leftwing parties to Polish parliamentary politics after a four-year absence, when a fragmented left failed to cross the parliamentary threshold.\n\n\u201cWe are returning to the parliament!\u201d Robert Biedro\u0144, one of Lewica\u2019s three co-leaders, told a post-election rally. \u201cWe are going back to where the Polish left has always belonged.\u201d\n\nThe exit poll also suggested that Konfederacja, a coalition of far-right and radical nationalist groups, would also cross the 5% threshold and enter parliament with 6.4% of the vote and a projected 13 seats.\n\nOne of the leaders of Konfederacja, which receives the bulk of its support from the country\u2019s youngest voters, is Janusz Korwin-Mikke, a veteran former MEP best known outside Poland for arguing that women are not intelligent enough to be allowed to vote.\n\nThe exit poll appears to confirm the fears of Civic Coalition and its largest party , the centre-right Civic Platform, which governed the country between 2007 and 2015.\n\n\u201cThere will be no Budapest in Warsaw!\u201d said Civic Platform\u2019s leader, Grzegorz Schetyna, a reference to Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s oft-quoted claim that his long-term intention was to emulate the so-called \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d pioneered by the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n.\n\nTurnout is estimated at 61.6%, a significant rise on the just over 50% of voters who participated in 2015. If confirmed, it would be the largest turnout in parliamentary elections since the fall of communism in 1989.", "description": "Conservative ruling party to win 43.6% of vote according to Ipsos poll", "authors": ["Christian Davies"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80611df5138f2bcec8a85ae10a14cef3ddbab4b9/0_265_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=04522fd5658073138fb7d6e5425bc52d", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
