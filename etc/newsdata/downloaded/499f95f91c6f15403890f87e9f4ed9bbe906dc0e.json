Is the issue of gender-neutral bathrooms really as morally urgent as a country that is, as Pete Buttigieg sharply put it, \u201cusing technology for the perfection of dictatorship?\u201d This is a worldview that encourages companies to take cost-free stands on the progressive cause of the moment and do absolutely nothing to uphold fundamental progressive values when doing so requires more sacrifice than the time it takes to write up a news release. A worldview that fails to force companies like the N.B.A., Apple, Google and Disney to account for the fact that they are serving as handmaidens to totalitarians is not one worth taking seriously.\n\nThe longstanding conventional wisdom on China \u2014 that engagement and investment by America in China would inevitably lead to the country\u2019s political liberalization \u2014 has simply not proven true. This is the chestnut Adam Silver himself insists on, when he speaks about the possibilities of \u201cbasketball diplomacy.\u201d\n\nAlas, just the opposite has happened.\n\nChina has become more repressive the more it has engaged with the West. Meantime, that economic engagement has led major Western businesses and institutions to keep quiet on a major moral issue of this century. The N.B.A.-China partnership is just one example of so many in which Beijing is calling the shots.", "description": "", "authors": ["Bari Weiss", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Nba-China-Hong-Kong.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
