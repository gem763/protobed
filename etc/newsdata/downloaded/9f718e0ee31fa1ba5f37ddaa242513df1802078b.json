That\u2019s despite an impeachment inquiry and the uproar over his decision Sunday night to draw down U.S. troops as Kurdish allies face a Turkish incursion into Syria.\n\nIt\u2019s not known which poll, if any, Trump was citing.\n\nTrump also insisted that the U.S. military had no ammunition when he \u201ctook over\u201d as commander in chief, and he characterized the Kurds and the Turks as \u201cnatural enemies.\u201d\n\nHe presented the wide-ranging remarks before signing a trade agreement with Japan.\n\nThe president called the House impeachment inquiry into his activities a \u201cscam.\u201d He added: \u201cAnd the people are wise to it. And that\u2019s why my polls went up, I think they said, 17 points in the last two or three days. I\u2019ve never had that one.\u201d\n\nThe impeachment inquiry was launched last month. Its focus is a July 25 phone call from Trump to Ukraine\u2019s president pressing him to launch an investigation into political rival Joe Biden. The request was made as Trump was withholding military aid to Ukraine.\n\nTrump wraps up by claiming his poll numbers have gone up by 17 points (!) in the last three days \ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com/NHDs33mt6h \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 7, 2019\n\nAs for his controversial decision on Syria, Trump appeared resigned Monday to inevitable fighting between Turkey and the Kurds because they\u2019re \u201cnatural enemies.\u201d He seemed surprised to note that a historian said Monday that they\u2019ve been fighting for \u201chundreds of years.\u201d\n\nHe boasted that ISIS was defeated, thanks largely to him, particularly because he supplied the U.S. military with ammunition when it had none.\n\n\u201cWhen I took over our military, we didn\u2019t have ammunition,\u201d he explained. \u201cI was told by a top general, maybe the top of them all: \u2018Sir, I\u2019m sorry, sir, we don\u2019t have ammunition.\u2019 I said, \u2018I will never let another president have that happen to him or her.
