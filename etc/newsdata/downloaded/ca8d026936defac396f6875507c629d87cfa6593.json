'I get up and I walk to my door and the way my house is set up, I can look down the hall,' Hill explained. 'I see a white female lady, bent over the tub, with my two-year-old in the tub.'\n\nShe immediately fought the woman off and got her boyfriend to hold her in place until the cops arrived.\n\nElizabeth Hixon, 22, was arrested and charged with burglary. The two women do not know one another.\n\n'Ms. Hixon stated that she entered the residence, to provide care to a juvenile, which was outside the residence,' an affidavit in the case, filed in Franklin County Municipal Court, reads.\n\nAreica Hill woke up and found another woman inside her home, getting ready to give her two-year-old son a bath\n\nHixon's own mother even told the television station that her 'daughter had good intentions' and that 'her heart was in the right place.'\n\nBut such sentiments appear to cut little ice with Hill.\n\n'I would like to see other charges filed against her,' Hill said.\n\nProsecutors have not yet announced what charges Hixon may face as the police investigation report has not been sent to them.\n\nHixon, meanwhile, has been released on bond.", "description": "An Ohio mother says she was horrified to discover an intruder inside her home preparing a bath for her two-year-old son.
