Here\u2019s how other countries decide where to host it.", "language": "en", "text": "And, in case its name doesn\u2019t make this clear, it\u2019s owned by President Trump.\n\nOn Thursday, the White House announced that Trump\u2019s Miami hotel would host next year\u2019s Group of Seven summit \u2014 in a move watchdogs groups are expected to quickly scrutinize as a conflict of interest due to the president\u2019s opportunity to profit off the event, which will draw leaders from some of the world\u2019s biggest economies, as well as their large entourages, journalists and security.\n\nAD\n\nActing White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Thursday that the Trump administration considered 10 sites as potential venues for the meetings and determined \u201cDoral was far away the best physical facility for this meeting.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn recent years, American presidents have hosted such summits at Camp David, a government-owned presidential retreat in Maryland, and at the Sea Island Resort in Georgia. (The Group of Seven was known as the Group of Eight until 2014, when Russia stopped participating in its meetings.)\n\nMember countries take turns serving as the group\u2019s rotating president and thus hosting the group\u2019s meetings each year. Here\u2019s where others have recently chosen to host the high-security event.\n\nAD\n\nCanada\n\nLast year, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hosted the G-7 summit in La Malbaie, Quebec, a small town on the Saint Lawrence River. As the Montreal Gazette reported at the time, one couple\u2019s house was close enough to the hotel that they had to pass through a security checkpoint just to get inside their own home. Still, the homeowner, Rosaire Tremblay, seemed content to deal with the increased security for what the small town would get in return: free advertising.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening here is the best thing that could have happened to La Malbaie,\u201d he told the Canadian newspaper. \u201cLook at the beauty here. Wait until the Europeans see this. Journalists will feed these images back. You can\u2019t buy advertising like this.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe summit was held at the Manoir Richelieu, a castle-like resort boasting 405 rooms and suites, views of the sprawling river, pools and a golf course. The town itself is home to less than 10,000 people, but in 2017, Trudeau said his government saw it \u201cas a partnership with the local community\u201d to host the summit there, describing the scenic town as \u201ca magnificent and ideal location in the image of our country,\u201d according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.\n\nItaly\n\nItaly has hosted one G-8 and one G-7 meeting in the past decade. In July 2009, then-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who\u2019s faced bribery and witness-tampering charges, held the G-8 summit in the central Italian city of L\u2019Aquila \u201cto show solidarity with the population\u201d after the region was hit by a severe earthquake that April, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn May 2017, Italy hosted the G-7 in the Sicilian city of Taormina, which an official website for the summit described as \u201cone of the Mediterranean\u2019s most suggestive towns.\u201d\n\nThe website went on to describe Taormina as a \u201cfascinating medieval village\u201d that has long \u201cattracted travelers aristocrats, artists and writers,\u201d including German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and American novelist Truman Capote, as well as England\u2019s King Edward VII and Russian Czar Nicholas I.\n\nGermany\n\nGermany brought the G-7 to the picturesque and isolated Schloss Elmau hotel in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe want to show our guests a beautiful corner of Germany and we are meeting in such a place \u2014 it is an important aspect for the success of these type of summits,\u201d Chancellor Angela Merkel said at the time.\n\nAD\n\nMerkel chose the Schloss Elmau both for its remote location and breathtaking views, and for its willingness to address its role in Germany\u2019s Nazi era, her office said at the time.\n\nAD\n\nThe castle\u2019s original builder and owner, a protestant theologian named Johannes Muller, played a complicated role during Adolf Hitler\u2019s rule, according to the hotel\u2019s website, at times speaking publicly in support of Germany\u2019s Jews but later facing prosecution over claims he had backed Hitler. He eventually lost ownership of the hotel, which briefly served as a sanatorium where Holocaust survivors took sanctuary.\n\nBy choosing the castle, which is now a luxury hotel, for the summit, Merkel\u2019s office highlighted in a statement that the castle\u2019s current owners have chosen to focus on hosting events \u201cthat contribute to German-Israeli and German-American understanding,\u201d her office said in a statement at the time.\n\nAD\n\nJapan\n\nIn 2016, Japan hosted the G-7 summit in Ise-Shima, a halfway point between Tokyo and Hiroshima.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI imagine you have had the opportunity to enjoy the charms of Japan\u2019s heartland areas \u2014 beautiful inlets, a wealth of natural beauty, and sumptuous seafood and mountain area food specialties,\u201d Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said in his opening statement. He went on to describe Ise Jingu, a shrine leaders visited during the summit, as a place with a \u201cdignified atmosphere\u201d that offered him a \u201csobering feeling.\u201d\n\n\u201cIse Jingu has spun a history that extends some 2,000 years, from time immemorial,\u201d he said. \u201cThere, people have offered up prayers for bountiful harvests, prayers for peace, and prayers for human happiness.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nIn June 2013, then-British Prime Minister David Cameron designated the remote Lough Erne golf club in Northern Ireland as the location for his G-8 getaway, reportedly in part to try to deter protesters from disrupting the event. Authorities built a metal fence that stretched about two miles from the resort in Fermanagh as officials braced for protests in nearby cities.\n\nAD\n\nThe location was also in theory supposed to benefit the local economy in Northern Ireland, still beset by economic woes years after a 1998 agreement effectively ended the Troubles, a 30-year period of extreme sectarian violence between Unionists, who favored keeping Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom, and Nationalists, who wanted Northern Ireland to join the Republic of Ireland.\n\nAD\n\nThe Guardian reported that the G-8 involved Northern Ireland\u2019s largest-ever police operation.\n\nBut according to a 2015 report, commissioned by the Northern Ireland Executive, the summit had \u201cno impact\u201d on local businesses and that less than half of the cost of the summit was spent locally, the BBC reported. On the resort\u2019s website, general manager Ferghal Purcell wrote that the G-8 leaders had, for the most part, just been too busy to partake in any of the luxurious perks the resort had to offer.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOther than Prime Minister Cameron taking a dip in the Lough one morning, they simply didn\u2019t have time to enjoy a Thai massage or a round of golf,\u201d Purcell said.\n\nFrance\n\nThe French coastal town of Biarritz is one of France\u2019s most popular summer tourist destinations. But in August this year, French President Emmanuel Macron essentially shut down the seaside town to host the G-7 summit there.\n\nMore than 13,000 police and security forces were deployed to ensure security at the meeting, which was held at the Hotel du Palais. The town\u2019s airport and train stations were shut down, and the hotel\u2019s beachfront location meant even access to a major beach was restricted \u2014 in France\u2019s August heat.\n\nThe Guardian reported that even surfers were asked to exit the waters and boats were redirected. Authorities also banned demonstrations, only authorizing protests against the summit in other towns. France even set up a special court to deal with demonstrators, earning criticism from watchdog groups like Amnesty International, which warned it could lead to \u201cindiscriminate arrest and fast-track judgments.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRussia\n\nRussia never had its chance to host the G-8 in Sochi in June 2014 as planned. Instead, that March, the seven other members changed the location to Brussels, the home of the European Union, after Russia annexed Crimea and incurred the wrath of western sanctions.\n\nAngered by the snub, Russia in turn declared that it didn\u2019t want to come anyway \u2014 and the G-8 has been the G-7 ever since.\n\nRussia chose Sochi in large part because it was conveniently already being upgraded to host the 2014 Olympic Winter Games.\n\n\u201cThe reasons for choosing Sochi are obvious,\u201d Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the state-run Tass news agency, Reuters reported. \u201cThe infrastructure being created in Sochi for the Olympic Games is practically ready and meets those requirements [for the G-8 summit].\u201d", "description": "Watchdogs are already calling President Trump\u2019s decision to host the summit a conflict of interest.", "authors": ["Siobh\u00e1n O'Grady", "Staff Writer", "Foreign Desk", "Miriam Berger", "Reporter Covering Middle East", "Foreign Affairs"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/P42zjfcj-Wa1yUkJsG5A3ui23A4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XF6BAFU3X4I6PDVB5WLVFBKHLY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
