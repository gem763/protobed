(Michael Noble, Jr./for The Washington Post)\n\nMichael Bloomberg, the billionaire businessman and philanthropist who has financed efforts to combat tobacco use around the world for years, has a new target: e-cigarettes in the United States.\n\nBloomberg Philanthropies announced Tuesday it would spend $160 million over three years to try to ban flavored e-cigarettes, which, it said, are specifically designed to entice kids to vape.\n\nThe vaping initiative is Bloomberg\u2019s first anti-tobacco effort aimed at the United States, according to officials of Bloomberg Philanthropies. They said the money will be used to press local, state and federal governments to ban flavored e-cigarettes; to push the Food and Drug Administration to be more aggressive in reviewing vaping products and imposing standards on e-cigarette products; and to back local and state governments that might face industry opposition or lawsuits for supporting e-cigarette bans.\n\n\u201cE-cigarette companies and the tobacco companies that back them are preying on America\u2019s youth,\u201d Bloomberg said in a statement. \u201cThe result is an epidemic that is spiraling out of control and putting kids in danger of addiction and serious health problems.\u201d\n\nThe Bloomberg announcement comes as federal health authorities are investigating five deaths from a mysterious lung illness tied to vaping. There are now 450 possible cases in 33 states and one territory. While many of the cases appear to involve marijuana products, a smaller number of patients say they used only nicotine e-cigarettes, federal officials have said.\n\nMatt Myers, president of the nonprofit Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, which will coordinate the Bloomberg effort, said the $160 million from Bloomberg will \u201callow us to transform what is going on\u201d in the battle over e-cigarettes. By year end, he predicted, \u201ca significant number\u201d of major cities will be considering e-cigarette prohibitions and several state legislatures will probably follow.\n\nSome states already are moving. On Monday, New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) announced plans to propose legislation to bar the possession, manufacture, sale and distribution of flavored e-cigarettes. Michigan has already announced plans to bar the products on an emergency basis.\n\nBesides removing flavored e-cigarettes from the marketplace, Bloomberg Philanthropies wants to end online e-cigarette sales until sales to kids can be prevented. Currently, the group said, \u201ccompanies have insufficient protections to keep kids from purchasing their products online.\u201d\n\nJust Monday, the FDA blasted Juul Labs for illegally marketing its e-cigarettes as less harmful than regular cigarettes and ordered the company to correct the violations immediately or face tougher enforcement actions. The agency noted that companies are required to get agency authorization to promote their products as less harmful than cigarettes. Juul said it will cooperate fully with the FDA.\n\nBloomberg Philanthropies said research indicates that Juul\u2019s marketing practices have been \u201cpatently youth-oriented.\u201d Reports indicate that the Federal Trade Commission is investigating Juul\u2019s marketing practices and the extent to which those efforts were geared toward kids. At a congressional hearing in July, Juul officials said that while Juul had made \u201cmissteps,\u201d it never wanted young people to use its vaping products.\n\nPeople close to Bloomberg said he is upset that the surge in underage e-cigarette use threatens a historic decline in smoking in recent years, and is determined to make sure that progress against smoking is not reversed.\n\nRead more\n\nHow two Stanford grads aimed for big tech glory and got Big Tobacco instead\n\nIn the \u2018Juul room\u2019: E-cigarettes spawn a form of teen addiction that worries doctors, parents and schools\n\nWhat we know about the mysterious vaping-linked illnesses and deaths", "description": "Effort marks philanthropist\u2019s first major anti-tobacco initiative in the United States.", "authors": ["Laurie Mcginley", "Reporter Covering Health", "September At Am", "Laurie Mcginley Covers Health", "Medicine For The Washington Post.
