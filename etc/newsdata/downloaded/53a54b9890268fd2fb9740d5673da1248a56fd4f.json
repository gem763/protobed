Fox News has reached out to McCabe\u2019s legal team for comment.\n\nEarlier this year, Flynn fired the legal team that negotiated his guilty plea.\n\nIn an Aug. 30 court filing, Flynn\u2019s new lawyer, Sidney Powell, wrote, \"The prosecutors in this case have repeatedly failed to produce Brady evidence despite\u2026the clarity of this Court's Order\u2026 their ethical and constitutional obligations\u2026specific requests for documents the prosecutors know are exculpatory, and\u2026 those requests being made multiple times.\"\n\nBrady evidence refers to all exculpatory evidence prosecutors are obligated to turn over, as established in the Supreme Court case Brady v. Maryland.\n\nPowell has alleged that members of the special counsel team prosecuting the case under the direction of prosecutor Andrew Weissmann \"affirmatively suppressed evidence (hiding Brady material) that destroyed the credibility of their primary witness, impugned their entire case against M. Flynn, while at the same time at the same time putting excruciating pressure on him to enter his guilty plea and manipulating or controlling the press to their advance to extort that plea.\"\n\nThe filing also highlights contact, reported by Fox News, between Weissmann and other senior Justice Department officials in the fall of 2016 before the presidential election, and nearly a year before Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel.\n\nPowell, Flynn\u2019s attorney, highlighted to the court that Justice Department official Bruce Ohr was a back channel to the FBI and shared the anti-Trump dossier with Justice Department officials who later joined the special counsel team.\n\nOhr gave a closed-door transcribed interview last August sharing details of his 2016 meetings with British ex-spy Christopher Steele, who authored the dossier later used to secure a surveillance warrant for a Trump campaign aide. The interview was part of the Republican-led House Oversight and Judiciary Committee probes.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn a series of questions about his meetings with Steele, including one on July 30, 2016, and who he shared the information with, Ohr referenced both McCabe and Weissmann.\n\nA separate motion from Flynn\u2019s legal team accused the prosecution of withholding the original FBI summary of Flynn's interview known as a 302.\n\nThe publicly released version of the 302 shows it was dated mid-February 2017 -- almost three weeks after the interview took place.\n\nThe prosecutors have taken the position that they gave Flynn's original legal team the relevant records, and in December 2017, Flynn accepted responsibility for his actions under oath.", "description": "Then-deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe told the White House in early February 2017 that the bureau was not considering then-national security adviser Michael Flynn for a potential Logan Act prosecution over conversations with the Russian ambassador before Donald Trump was sworn in as president, government records reviewed by Fox News indicate.", "authors": ["Catherine Herridge", "Catherine Herridge Is An Award-Winning Chief Intelligence Correspondent For Fox News Channel", "Fnc", "Based In Washington", "D.C.
