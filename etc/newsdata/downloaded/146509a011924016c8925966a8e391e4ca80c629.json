The climbing community think a hiker threw the rock from the cliff above, unaware there were people below.\n\nThe climber was airlifted from the island. He had the tendon reattached and plates inserted in the arm, but will need to wait to discover if there is lasting nerve damage.\n\nTung Lung Chau is a popular climbing spot. One area known as the Technical Wall has a wide sea platform that climbers sit on as their fellow rock enthusiasts scale the crags above, but occasionally they are showered by falling debris.\n\nStuart Millis, a prominent member of the climbing community who operates the website Hong Kong Climbing, said he and fellow climbers cleared loose rocks from above the crag, and hikers tend not to get close enough to the edge to accidentally knock a rock loose, suggesting the rock was thrown.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s anger and frustration because it is irresponsible,\u201d Millis said. \u201cIf you can see the sea you might be inclined to throw a rock and see it go \u2018plop\u2019. But doing it when you can\u2019t see the bottom ...\u201d\n\nThe rock was the \u201csize of a brick\u201d, Millis said, adding that if it had hit someone on the head it would have been \u201cgame over\u201d.\n\nMillis has emailed the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) and asked for a sign to be put up saying \u201cbeware, people below\u201d. A similar request was made to the AFCD for Lion Rock a few years ago, Millis said, and they responded quickly, erecting a sign, so he is hopeful for the same again.\n\n\u201cWe just want people to think about their actions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful spot, so we don\u2019t want to stop people going there. We aren\u2019t asking for big nets or anything like that.\u201d\n\nIn Millis\u2019 time climbing in Hong Kong, he has seen a few flurries of rocks come down Tung Lung\u2019s crags, but rarely, if ever, has he seen a rock this big.\n\n\u201cIn the last few years you\u2019re getting more and more people who are heading out to nature,\u201d he said. \u201cSo maybe there are more people who just aren\u2019t aware.\n\n\u201cA sign at least warns people and makes them think twice,\u201d Millis added.", "description": "Angry and frustrated climbing community call incident at Tung Lung Chau irresponsible\n  A climber on Tung Lung Chau has arm broken, tendons severed and fears nerve damage after a hiker launches a rock off a cliff", "authors": ["Mark Agnew"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/15/fc22d6aa-ee53-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39_image_hires_092000.jpeg?itok=GZDgih83&v=1571102405", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
