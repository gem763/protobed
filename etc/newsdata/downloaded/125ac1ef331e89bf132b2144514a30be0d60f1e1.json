Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction. And all you can talk about is money,\u201d the 16-year-old is heard saying. \u201cYou are failing us, and the young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you.\n\nIf world leaders choose to fail us, my generation will never forgive them | Greta Thunberg Read more\n\n\u201cWe will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not.\u201d\n\nThe sample of Thunberg saying \u201cright here, right now\u201d is used throughout the song.\n\nThe mash-up originally appeared on social media in late September, after musician David Scott from The Kiffness made and shared it to images of ice bergs breaking up.\n\nFatboy Slim, whose real name is Norman Cook, shared video of the mash-up on Facebook. But he has now integrated Thunberg\u2019s speech into his live show, performing it at his Gateshead show on Friday night.\n\nDavid Scott (@TheKiffness) #GretaThurnberg mashed with @FatboySlim - Right Here, Right Now. pic.twitter.com/InbZLf3awU\n\nScott Jackson, 40, from Middlesbrough, filmed the mash-up at the Gateshead show.\n\nJackson, who said he found Thunberg\u2019s speech \u201cincredibly powerful and emotive\u201d said he had seen a short clip of the remix during the week and loved it, so wanted to film how it sounded in a large arena.\n\n\u201cThe mash-up is superb,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way she says \u2018right here, right now\u2019 fits his original perfectly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe crowd could sense something special was in the air as it started, sensing something big was about to go down and it certainly did!\u201d\n\nThunberg\u2019s speech was the most striking and talked-about event at the recent meeting of world leaders at the United Nations in New York.\n\nDonald Trump tweeted a video of an emotional Thunberg delivering the speech, with an apparently sarcastic comment, writing: \u201cShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!\u201d\n\nBut world leaders and artists rallied in support of the teenage activist, including Billie Eilish, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Ellie Goulding, Mark Ruffalo and Leonardo DiCaprio, who all tweeted clips of Thunberg\u2019s speech or in praise of it.\n\nJanelle Mon\u00e1e, Cindi (@JanelleMonae) The coolest .
