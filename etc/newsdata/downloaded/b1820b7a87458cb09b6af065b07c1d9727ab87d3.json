Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), chairman of the House Oversight Committee; Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chair of the House Intelligence Committee; and Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nIt states that Mulvaney\u2019s failure to comply, even at Trump\u2019s behest, \u201cmay be used as an adverse inference against you and the President.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe White House has refused to engage with \u2015 or even respond to \u2015 multiple requests for documents from our Committees on a voluntary basis,\u201d the subpoena read. \u201cAfter nearly a month of stonewalling, it appears clear that the President has chosen the path of defiance, obstruction, and cover-up.\u201d\n\nThe subpoena ends: \u201cWe deeply regret that President Trump has put us \u2015 and the nation \u2015 in this position, but his actions have left us with no choice but to issue this subpoena.\u201d\n\nThe House oversight, intelligence, and foreign affairs committee chairs also sent a letter to Vice President Mike Pence on Friday asking him to produce documents related to Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. House investigators on Thursday heard from their first witness in the probe, Kurt Volker, who was the State Department\u2019s former special envoy to Ukraine before he abruptly resigned last week.\n\nThe House is looking into whether Trump was seeking a quid pro quo agreement from Ukraine when he asked the country\u2019s president in a July 25 phone call to investigate Biden. At the center of Trump\u2019s demand was the unsubstantiated allegation that then-Vice President Biden used his power to kill an investigation into a gas company for which his son, Hunter Biden, worked.\n\nTrump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in his interactions with Ukrainian leaders.\n\nRead the full letter below:\n\nThis is a developing story.
