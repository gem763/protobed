Her ever-evolving style means constant changes, especially when she\u2019s traveling abroad. Currently in Seoul, where she\u2019s celebrating Fenty Beauty\u2019s South Korean launch, the star has had fun wearing CEO-worthy suits as well as dresses fresh from the Spring 2020 runways. While touring the Itaewon shopping district on Wednesday, she even found time to tackle a tricky trend. She wore a hot pink gown from Jacquemus\u2019s 10th-anniversary collection over a pair of highlighter orange cargo pants, making eccentric layering seem sexy and effortless.\n\nDresses worn over pants are far from a new concept\u2014anyone who lived through the 90s and early 00s can tell you as much\u2014but Rihanna\u2019s version felt fresh. Her floor-length gown with spaghetti straps and delicate buttons would have looked right at home on the red carpet, but the sportiness of her baggy trousers added an unexpected athletic twist. Polished off with a pair of pointy sandals from her Fenty line, the look was another chic addition to her Seoul wardrobe.\n\nOriginally Appeared on Vogue\n\n", "description": "Who says you can't wear a dress with pants?", "authors": ["Janelle Okwodu"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/A3wPwyUuEKn_9C8oiEis2Q--~B/aD0xMzg4O3c9MjQ2OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/vogue_137/1632afb11a33b017c30fd47e5682c540", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
