That\u2019s the lowest level since February 2017, suggesting some investors aren\u2019t waiting for Moody\u2019s to downgrade the country to junk - a move which would see it removed from Citigroup's World Government Bond Index, sparking forced sales by investors who track the gauge.\n\nThat\u2019s despite the fact the South Africa\u2019s yields are the highest in the WGBI, which requires an investment-grade rating from either Moody\u2019s or S&P Ratings and is tracked by investors overseeing as much as $3 trillion. Moody\u2019s is the only major company to rate South Africa\u2019s debt at investment level after S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings cut their assessments to junk in 2017.\n\n\u201cInvestors who would be forced sellers in a downgrade, some of them have sold,\u201d said Edwin Gutierrez, London-based head of emerging-market sovereign debt at Aberdeen Asset Management. \u201cRamaphoria clearly has died,\u201d he said, referring to a term coined to describe investor confidence after President Cyril Ramaphosa took office in February 2018.\n\nMoody\u2019s said last month its stable outlook for South Africa\u2019s debt meant the credit rating was probably safe for another 12 to 18 months, and that President Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s government needed time to implement economic reforms, including fixing the loss-making power utility Eskom. Still, the company could lose patience if the mid-term budget statement later this month doesn\u2019t convince it the government has a handle on debt and the fiscal deficit.\n\n\u201cThe upcoming Eskom unbundling white paper is the main yardstick to watch,\u201d said Daniel Tenengauzer, the New-York based head of markets strategy at BNY Mellon, in a note to clients. Failure to produce a credible turn-around plan for Eskom would put the government on the hook for much of its R450bn ($29bn) of debt, putting pressure on the fiscal shortfall, estimated at 4.9% of gross domestic product in the February budget.\n\nIf the deficit widens to more than 5.5% of GDP, that would \u201clikely change Moody\u2019s optimistic take on fiscal accounts,\u201d Tenengauzer said. A downgrade to junk would lead to bond outflows of at much as $15bn, according to BNY Mellon.\n\nThe yield on South Africa\u2019s benchmark bonds due December 2026 had risen six basis points by 1:24 p.m. in Johannesburg in the week to date, trading at 8.36%, the highest level since August 21. Foreign investors have sold a net R2.7bn rand of South African bonds last month through September 27, according to JSE data, bringing outflows this year to R8.8bn.", "description": "There\u2019s still a month to go until Moody\u2019s Investors Service reviews South Africa\u2019s sovereign rating, but foreign investors aren\u2019t taking chances.", "authors": ["- Colleen Goko"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4032/9b714aec1b694cb69b7dc4b2aa0dff93.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
