Not to mention the bladder pressure. Back aches. Being kicked all day long - which I love too haha but sometimes those teeny feet can take your breath away.\n\n'Just trying to go about every day life is exhausting! So nope I don't miss the bump! Maybe ask me in another year but for now I'm loving being light on my feet and sleeping on my tummy.'", "description": "Mother Elisha Bakes, from Melbourne, has proudly showed off her incredible body transformation just months after she was cruelly taunted over the size of her baby bump.", "authors": ["Cindy Tran For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/04/20113772-0-image-a-10_1571887235869.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
