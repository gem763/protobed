Now she is undertaking this mammoth challenge\n\n\u2018Their deaths came as a huge shock. It was the kind of news that you can\u2019t quite believe, and it stops you in your tracks,\u2019 Sophia tells Metro.co.uk.\n\n\u2018You mull over the last time you saw or spoke to them and wonder if you could\u2019ve been in touch a bit more often and been there, been available, to lend an ear. You\u2019re left with lots of questions that will never get answered. Lots of \u201cwhys\u201d and \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d.\n\n(Picture: Sophia Badger)\n\nOne was a friend Sophia met at university, and the other a friend she met during a work sabbatical travelling in Central America.\n\nThe pair didn\u2019t know each other, but they passed away about six weeks apart. Like Sophia, they were both in their mid-30s, with so much of their lives left to live.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Their deaths were incredibly tragic and we lost them both far too soon,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018Suicide produces a very challenging form of grief. You don\u2019t really want to believe it, and you struggle to understand it. But my own experience pails into insignificance compared to that of the families of my two friends.\n\n\u2018The past year has been incredibly challenging for them, day in and day out. And that will continue for the rest of their lives.\u2019\n\nChampagne vineyards at dawn in France (Picture: Sophia Badger)\n\nThe idea to do something substantial to honour the memory of her friends came to Sophia at the height of her grief, but it helped her realise that she needed to do something positive.\n\n\u2018I was at the memorial service of one of my friends,\u2019 says Sophia.\n\n\u2018The celebrant did a fantastic job of channelling our energy away from all of those unanswerable questions to remembering the person that we had lost. Remembering her outgoing character, adventurous spirit, and charitable work, rather than the way in which she passed away.\n\n\u2018Driving home after the service I was filled with the feeling that I wanted to do something to raise awareness about mental health and raise money for a mental health charity.\n\n\u2018I had often given thought to doing a long walk or an overland horseback adventure, but never quite found the right time to actually commit myself to anything.\n\nThe Roman bridge in Pont Saint Martin, Italy (Picture: Sophia Badger)\n\n\u2018By the time I pulled up outside my house, I had more or less decided that I was going to walk to Rome, following a medieval pilgrimage route called the Via Francigena which I\u2019d read about a few years previously.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I decided that I would do it to raise money for the mental health charity Mind.\u2019\n\nSophia is half Italian, so her once-in-a-lifetime walk has also been an eye-opening journey into her heritage as well. She says the trip has also been an incredible physical challenge, crossing the Alps, the Jura Mountains, and the Apennines, and walking for days through wheat and rice fields, all solo.\n\nTellaro, Ligurian Coast, Italy (Picture: Sophia Badger)\n\nSophia has already raised more than \u00a310,000 for Mind, money that will help to change lives. But what she wants to achieve is bigger than just money.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m learning a lot about myself and the places that I pass through, and having my eyes opened by the life stories of locals and other walkers that I meet along the way.\n\n\u2018Mind has told me that the money I have raised so far will allow them to answer more than 1,200 calls to their info line, which provides advice and support to people experiencing a mental health problem.\n\n\u2018But raising money is just one aspect of what I hope to achieve though.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s so important that we have conversations about mental health, to open up and share our experiences and ask for help when we need it. So often we keep what\u2019s going on with our mental health to ourselves.\u2019\n\nSophia aims to use her journey to start these conversations. To let people know that it\u2019s OK and normal to not feel OK, and that no-one needs to go through a mental health problem alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018What I\u2019ve noticed is that when someone opens up it has a domino effect,\u2019 says Sophia. \u2018It\u2019s an amazing thing to see, suddenly people understand that they aren\u2019t alone in the way they think or feel, and there\u2019s a huge amount of comfort they take from hearing someone else\u2019s story.\u2019\n\nThe village of Lods in the Jura Mountains (Picture: Sophia Badger)\n\nBefore embarking on her walk, Sophia also visited a number of huge companies including Google, O2, GoCompare and Shell, to help them start those conversations and to raise awareness about mental health both inside and outside the workplace.\n\n\u2018Mental health is something that we all have, every day, just like physical health. It\u2019s not something to be scared of, and it\u2019s something that we should all feel comfortable and capable of talking about in the same way that we talk about our physical health.\n\n\u2018Historically there has been a lot of stigma around mental illness, which has made this incredibly challenging.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s changing, and we\u2019re in the midst of a huge movement to raise awareness and start those all-important conversations that will help to normalise mental health problems. But there is still some way to go.\n\nOne in four people experience a mental health problem each year, but so many people find it difficult to talk about. That\u2019s what Sophia is hoping to address.\n\nViews across Lake Geneva (Picture: Sophia Badger)\n\n\u2018Sometimes you can see the look on someone\u2019s face drop when you say the words \u201cmental health\u201d, she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018That might be because they\u2019re uncomfortable talking about it, or they don\u2019t understand it, or they have certain preconceived ideas about it.\n\n\u2018Poor mental health is all around us, and the people experiencing that poor mental health need others to be understanding, to provide support systems, and to not make them feel isolated and alone.\u2019\n\nNeed support? Contact the Samaritans For emotional support you can call the Samaritans 24-hour helpline on 116 123, email jo@samaritans.org, visit a Samaritans branch in person or go to the Samaritans website.\n\nTo fund her trip, Sophia has been using Airsorted to rent her flat our while she is away, which takes care of her rent and her bills and allows her to focus on raising vital funds.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve been walking for three months now, and it hasn\u2019t been cheap,\u2019 she explains. \u2018Every penny that people donate goes directly to Mind and doesn\u2019t fund my walk in any way. And that\u2019s as it should be.\n\n\u2018Without Airsorted I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve been in a position to do the walk, so using their services has been a real game-changer.\u2019\n\nSophia is due to reach her final destination Rome in the next couple of weeks.\n\nStrong Women Strong Women is a weekly series that champions diversity in the world of sport and fitness. A Sport England study found that 40% of women were avoiding physical activity due to a fear of judgement. But, contrary to the limited images we so often see, women of any age, size, race or ability can be active and enjoy sport and fitness. We hope that by normalising diverse depictions of women who are fit, strong and love their bodies, we will empower all women to shed their self-consciousness when it comes to getting active. Each week we talk to women who are redefining what it means to be strong and achieving incredible things.\n\nMORE: \u2018I caught a flesh-eating parasite in the Amazon jungle \u2013 doctors told me it could eat away my face\u2019\n\nMORE: Strong Women: \u2018My rugby team fought for equality in Japan \u2013 but the fight against prejudice isn\u2019t over\u2019\n\nMORE: Strong Women: \u2018I was struggling to cope with my husband\u2019s MS \u2013 mountain biking brought me back from the brink\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "This week on Strong Women Sophia's walking from London to Rome to honour two friends who took their own lives within six weeks of each other.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris", "Senior Lifestyle Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/strong-women-35-09c6_1570266150.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
