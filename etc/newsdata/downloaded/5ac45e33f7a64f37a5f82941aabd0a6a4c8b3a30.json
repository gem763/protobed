President Tusk is now consulting leaders of the EU27 on this. And, it is first and foremost for the UK to explain the next steps. We from our side will of course follow all the events in London this week very closely,\u201d Andreeva said.\n\nShe added that the ratification process of the deal negotiated by Johnson has been launched on the EU side, and that the bloc's chief negotiator Michel Barnier will debrief the EU Parliament's Brexit Steering Group in Strasbourg on Monday afternoon.\n\nQuick recap: Johnson sent three letters to the European Union on Saturday, it included an unsigned letter with the exact wording in the Benn Act (the legislation that obliged Johnson to request a Brexit delay); and a personal letter from Johnson saying that a further delay would be \"corrosive.\"", "description": "Boris Johnson hopes to put his Brexit deal to the UK Parliament on Monday, but a vote may not even be granted.
