(Photo: Getty)\n\nStudents are urging the University of Oxford in England to ban clapping out of fears it could trigger anxiety.\n\nRepresentatives from the Student Union (SU) passed a motion last week to replace clapping with \u201cjazz hands\u201d in hopes that this will make events \u201cmore inclusive\u201d and \u201caccessible\u201d for those with the mental health condition.\n\nThis comes after the University of Manchester made international headlines for passing a similar motion in September 2018. Never one to shy away from controversy, TV host Piers Morgan accused Britain of \u201closing its mind.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives from the Oxford student union passed a motion to introduce \u201cjazz hands.\u201d (Photo: Getty) More\n\n\u201cThe policy was proposed in order to encourage the use of British Sign Language clapping [better known as jazz hands] during our democratic events, to make those events more accessible and inclusive for all, including people who suffer from anxiety,\u201d Oxford sabbatical officer Roisin McCallion said. Clapping is also represented by waving and twisting the hands in American Sign Language.\n\n\u201cInclusivity is one of the students\u2019 union\u2019s founding principles. We recognize certain groups are underrepresented in political environments and we are working to address that. This policy is one way of doing so inside Oxford SU.\u201d\n\nThe move has been met with criticism, with one former student calling it \u201ccompletely ludicrous,\u201d The Sun reported.\n\nStudents at the University of Manchester in Manchester, England voted to ditch clapping, whooping and cheering at the union\u2019s democratic events last year, arguing that they can be distressing for those with autism, sensory issues or deafness.\n\nIn response to the negative press, a union spokesperson told iNews that \u201cwe are not banning audible clapping \u2014 we understand some people may be more comfortable to continue using it.\n\n\u201cWe hope this decision goes some way towards promoting a better way of doing politics so that more people from all walks of life find it easier to participate in decision-making that will affect the way their Students\u2019 Union is run.\"\n\nThe National Union of Students encouraged its members to ditch clapping in 2015, warning those who continue to whoop and cheer would face \u201cconsequences,\u201d The Telegraph reported.\n\nDoes clapping trigger anxiety?\n\nLoud noises are not considered a common cause of anxiety. However, a condition called hyperacusis can make everyday sounds like chewing, barking and jingling coins sound louder than they are.\n\nThe condition can be triggered by tinnitus, a head injury or Lyme disease, according to Britain\u2019s National Health Service. While it may not seem serious, the health service warns a hyperacusis sufferer\u2019s relationships, work and \u201cgeneral wellbeing\u201d can all be affected.\n\nMany autistic people also experience \u201cmeltdowns\u201d when they feel overwhelmed, according to the National Autistic Society in the U.K..\n\nThose with autism often have \u201csensory differences.\u201d As a result, even a loud announcement at a train station can trigger pain and \u201csensory overload,\u201d the charity adds.\n\nHannah Molesworth, who has autism, told the BBC last year that she \u201cliterally freezes up,\u201d has a meltdown or \u201cruns away\u201d when she hears clapping.\n\nDeaf people also typically opt for jazz hands over clapping at events. Hearing aids can pick up on the sound, turning it into an irritating white noise.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\n\u2022 Woman puts uplifting message on billboard to help prevent suicide after the loss of her father: \u2018You are enough\u2019\n\n\u2022 \u2018Long Island Medium' Theresa Caputo on her 'psychic' gift: 'I have to make what I do seem very easy'\n\n\u2022 'I couldn\u2019t believe that it was me': How seeing a photo of herself at a tailgate party inspired one woman to lose 69 pounds\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Representatives from the student union passed a motion to replace clapping with the \"jazz hands\" used in sign language.", "authors": ["Alexandra Thompson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/w5J7DjBQhZ.D1lPtQ2WnKw--~B/aD0zNDIwO3c9NTEzMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/33570350-f65e-11e9-bcc7-3cdeb32d2871", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
