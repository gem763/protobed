Now it is spread out throughout the country. Once it was not uncommon for gangs to kill adults but leave children unharmed. Now, the killing of children alongside their parents has become all too frequent.\n\nPerhaps the most disconcerting change: Bloody cartel violence outraged Mexicans and captured international attention for the drug war, which saw 27,000 homicides during its peak in 2011. Today, even though the number of Mexico\u2019s homicides soared to near 35,000 last year, the bloodshed seems to draw less attention and indignation.\n\nIt has all left many Mexicans wondering which way to turn.\n\nThat was evident this week in Coatzacoalcos, an oil industry city in the Gulf coast state of Veracruz where residents say gangs have been fighting over turf and extorting business owners with threats of violence. Late Tuesday, suspected members of the Jalisco cartel showed up at the Caballo Blanco nightclub, blocked its exits and set a fire that killed 28 people trapped inside, apparently because the owner had either refused to make extortion payments or sold drugs from another gang.\n\nVanessa Galindo Blas lost her common-law husband, Erick Hern\u00e1ndez Enriquez, to the blaze. Both were natives of Coatzacoalcos, but had been discussing moving away.\n\nRelatives and friends attend the funeral of Erick Hernandez at a cemetery in Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz State, Mexico, on August 29, 2019. VICTORIA RAZO\u2014AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cWe had talked about leaving here for somewhere safer, so our kids could have a better future,\u201d Galindo Blas said Thursday as she stretched her hands out over Erick\u2019s bare metal coffin. On it rested a photo of him wearing an \u201cI Love Coatzacoalcos\u201d T-shirt.\n\nBut they could never agree on a place to move, in part because violence is now a problem across much of Mexico, so no place is really safe.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2012, much of the drug war killing occurred in a string of northern Mexico cities \u2014 Ciudad Juarez, Tijuana, Culiacan, Reynosa and Nuevo Laredo. \u201cNow it is more dispersed, and that also makes it harder to control,\u201d said Alejandro Hope, a security analyst in Mexico.\n\nBut counting down all the similarities \u2014 deadly arson attacks, bodies left piled in heaps or hung from overpasses, massacres at parties, beheading videos posted on social media \u2014 the parallels between now and then are all too clear. \u201cIt\u2019s like deja vu all over again,\u201d said Hope.\n\nAnother disturbing trend is that young children are being gunned down by killers targeting adults. The Sinaloa and Juarez cartels once prided themselves on their targeted killings, which riddled intended targets with bullets while leaving family members untouched.\n\nNow, children are being killed with chilling frequency. In June, a young boy was killed along with his father in Sonora state. In July, a 10-year-old was killed during a robbery in Puebla state. In August, gunmen burst into a home in Ciudad Juarez and fired 123 bullets that killed three girls, aged 14, 13 and 4, along with an adult male who apparently was the real target.\n\nTwo years ago, Coatzacoalcos made headlines across Mexico when a man, his wife and three young children were gunned down by a drug cartel. In contrast, the shooting of the three Ciudad Juarez girls drew less attention.\n\n\u201cIt seems like we are becoming accustomed to this, to people killing children. I don\u2019t want to become accustomed to that,\u201d said Lenit Enriquez Orozco, an activist in Coatzacoalcos. Her brother, Jonith Enriquez Orozco, has been missing since he was abducted on Sept. 25, 2015. There has been no trace of him since, even though her group, the Mothers\u2019 Collective of Searchers, has hunted for traces in clandestine burial grounds across Veracruz.\n\nHope notes Mexico has a lamentable record in investigating and prosecuting killings \u2014 over 90 percent of crime go unpunished.\n\nIn this June 2, 2019 file photo, the body of a bloodied man lies in the middle of a street where police and forensic workers secure the crime scene in Acapulco, Mexico. Bernardino Hernandez\u2014AP\n\n\u201cThe risk involved in killing a man, or killing his whole family, is the same,\u201d the analyst said. Under that logic, wiping out an entire family \u201chas its advantages. It is more intimidating, it is easier to carry out, and it makes escaping easier.\u201d\n\nThe relentless violence has numbed many people.\n\nIn 2010, gunmen burst into a party of high school students in Ciudad Juarez\u2019s Villas de Salvarcar neighborhood, killing 15 in what appeared to have been a case of mistaken identity. The bloodbath provoked large, angry street protests and a visit by an apologetic President Felipe Calder\u00f3n.\n\nThis year, in April, gunmen burst into a party in Minatitlan, near Coatzacoalcos, and killed 14 people. Days later, a few dozen people held a subdued peace march. \u201cIt\u2019s politics as usual, nothing happened. This should generate generalized indignation\u201d against cartels and government leaders alike, Hope said.\n\nHe attributes the muted response to new President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s high approval ratings, topping 70% in some polls nine months into his term. Such ratings \u201ctend to intimidate expressions of indignation,\u201d Hope said.\n\nMany Mexicans also are willing to give L\u00f3pez Obrador the benefit of the doubt as even the president acknowledges that violent crime is the most serious challenge he faces. To the extent possible, L\u00f3pez Obrador has avoided violent confrontations with gangs that were often blamed for spawning violence during Calder\u00f3n\u2019s 2006-2012 administration. L\u00f3pez Obrador has even personally congratulated troops who allowed themselves to be abducted and disarmed by vigilante groups that are often linked to cartels.\n\nHe insists his go-slow policies of reducing youth unemployment will eventually solve the root causes of the problem better than declaring another frontal offensive against drug cartels.\n\nA soldier stands guard next to pictures of missing persons hanging from a rope in front of the National Palace during the commemoration of the International Day of the Disappeared in Mexico City, on August 30, 2019.

Irineo Gomez was the sole support of not only her children, but her elderly parents. Erick Hern\u00e1ndez Enriquez left little behind for his family aside from a modest, three-room cinderblock house.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of empty houses in Coatzacoalcos, a lot of people have left,\u201d said Maria Fabiola Davila, a civic activist. \u201cThose who can afford it move to another country.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Mexico's drug war appears to be worse this time around than in the bloody years of the government's 2006-2012 attempts against drug cartels.", "authors": ["Mark Stevenson"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/mexico-drug-war-deaths.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}
