Make no mistake, the votes are still for sale, but the direct cash payments are (mostly) gone. While bags of bills may have been how it worked in the past, that\u2019s not how corruption happens anymore. A lot of money still changes hands and people are getting rich, but it\u2019s now done legally through intermediaries.\n\nHunter Biden knew as much about Ukraine and the oil and natural gas business as he did about not smoking crack, so of course him getting a position with a Ukrainian gas and oil company for $50,000 per month was a pay-off to his dad. Every parent wants their kids to do well, few are in a position to actually make that happen. Or, in the case of the former vice president, in charge of a US administration\u2019s policy for a country most people couldn\u2019t find on a map.\n\nBut Biden\u2019s shady dealings are not unique to him, or to Democrats. It\u2019s political grift by proxy. You can\u2019t pay off a politician anymore because there are digital fingerprints everywhere, so you find other ways to achieve the same outcome.\n\nChildren and spouses of politicians are raking in cash from campaigns and corporations seeking to buy influence. And it\u2019s all legal. Remember: these are the people who write the rules.\n\nBoard seats and sweetheart \u201cconsulting\u201d and lobbying contracts are the new bags of cash. Want a chairman of a specific committee to look favorably on your bids for government contracts? Put someone close to them in a position to benefit from it. Want protections from regulators or to use regulators to harm your competitors or guard against foreign competition? Make the livelihood of someone who matters to the people in power dependent upon getting your way. Watch the seas part.\n\nCampaigns are not the cash cows corporations are, no one is raking in more than the average American family\u2019s annual income every month from them like Hunter Biden was from Burisma. But for the closest to direct payoffs you can get, look no further than campaign cash.\n\nPoliticians beg for money every single day. If you have the misfortune to end up on a campaign\u2019s email list, you find yourself getting emails begging for money from big name politicians and people you\u2019ve never heard of.\n\nThey all breathlessly try to spin the reader up about how important it is you give, even just a couple of dollars, to them to keep or get them in office. You likely laugh at them, they\u2019re absurd to normal people. But they must work on someone because they keep sending them and the money flows.\n\nMuch of that money goes to politicians who have a better shot of waking up naked on the moon than they do losing their reelection bids. After they contract with the necessary powerbrokers and kick \u201cwalking around money\u201d to the required people, a good chunk of that cash ends up in the pockets of their family members.\n\nHere\u2019s just one example: Maxine Waters won reelection in 2018 with 78 percent of the vote even though she doesn\u2019t live in her district. Her job is so safe that she could hold a press conference the week before the vote and call her constituents morons while whipping puppies into a woodchipper and she\u2019d still win in a walk. But she still raises a fortune for her campaign.\n\nBeing Chair of the House Financial Services Committee has its perks, people with a lot of money want to suck up to Waters so they can make even more.\n\nTo remain in the good graces of Waters or any Member of Congress you gotta cut a check, whether their campaign needs the money or not. In the case of Waters, she hired her daughter to handle campaign mailing to voters. Why mail voters who are going to reelect you no matter what when mailing constituents is budgeted for in every congressional office? Because your campaign can pay family a ton of money to do it.\n\nThe Washington Free Beacon reports Karen Waters, Maxine\u2019s daughter, was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to send out mailers for her mother\u2019s campaign. Those campaign contributions don\u2019t go directly into the pockets of the politicians, they\u2019re laundered through the campaigns to family members, sometimes spouses. And it\u2019s all legal.\n\nWaters is not alone, not by a long shot.\n\nSay what you want about President Trump, none of his kids have set up \u201cconsulting firms\u201d or lobbying shops to capitalize on their father\u2019s presidency. If they did, the left would never stop screaming about it. Yet, right out in the open, there are payoffs, kickbacks, and graft happening every day. Hunter Biden is in the spotlight right now, and with good reason, but he\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. It\u2019s all legal, all out in the open, corrupt as hell, and no one is saying a damn thing about it.\n\nDerek is the host of a free daily podcast (subscribe!) and author of the book, Outrage, INC., which exposes how liberals use fear and hatred to manipulate the masses.", "description": "There\u2019s a common misconception in the public that there are .10/03/2019 3:13:10AM EST.", "authors": ["Derek Hunter", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2014/211/0d8d750f-4819-4a67-a2fc-e0ec0f26baa0.jpg"}
