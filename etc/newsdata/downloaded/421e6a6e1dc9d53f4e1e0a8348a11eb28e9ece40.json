Simplicity was the driving factor.\u201d\n\nThe decision has been met by mixed reviews from Instagram users, with some welcoming the change.\n\nOne user said: \u201cI was never a fan of the \u2018Following\u2019 feature. Felt creepy.\u201d\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nAnd another joked: \u201cMoment of silence for all the creepers.\u201d\n\nHowever, others are devastated about the change.\n\nOne user said: \u201cSad to see it go. It\u2019s a great way to find new people and awesome photos.\u201d\n\nAnother added: \u201cNoooo whyyy! I use that every day to find new photographers that my friends are interacting with...what the hell instagram.\u201d", "description": "Speaking to Buzzfeed News, Instagram confirmed that the tab will be removed on the app this week", "authors": ["Shivali Best", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article8320004.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/9_Instagram.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
