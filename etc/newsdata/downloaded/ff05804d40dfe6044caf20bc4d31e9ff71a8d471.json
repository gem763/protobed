The upside move was minor in the context of bitcoin\u2019s recent losses. Therefore, the cryptocurrency somewhat remained under the risks of further downside moves. At the same time, alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, performed way better than bitcoin, indicating that traders are looking elsewhere as the number-one cryptocurrency shows low price volatility.\n\nFamous cryptocurrency investor, codenamed Salsa Tekila, noted that bitcoin is now consolidating around the $8,000 level for almost a month. He said the absence of corrective trades could push the cryptocurrency lower.\n\nYou guys realize we been consolidating at the 8ks after a macro break-down for 1 month? Sure I been wrong since last Friday\u2026 Sure maybe this is actually the bottom and I won't be the hero catching it, sure this short hedge will maybe get stopped out like my past trades. \u2014 SalsaTekila (JUL) (@SalsaTekila) October 22, 2019\n\n\u201cI might be on a drawdown streak past few days,\u201d Tekila tweeted. \u201cI maybe will lose more due to my short bias if we\u2019re bottoming. But odds that BTC have bottomed are slim IMO. Break down more likely.\u201d\n\nMacroeconomic Factors in Focus\n\nThe sideways trend in the bitcoin market also comes at the time when the global economy is waiting for the outcome of two of the most important events: the US-China trade war and Brexit. Bitcoin was trending upwards when concerns over the trade dispute rocked the global markets. The cryptocurrency\u2019s move uphill in the second quarter led analysts to say that it behaves like a hedging asset.\n\nEven in the past week, Bitcoin formed a near-term negative correlation with the pound, matching steps with the sentiments arising from an uncertain Brexit deal. As of today, the cryptocurrency remained firm as the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson entered the parliament to secure a vote on Brexit. But the possibility of a breakthrough is highly unlike as the House of Commons looks to defeat the motion altogether.\n\nThe public doesn\u2019t want any more delays. Let\u2019s get Brexit done on October 31st and move this country forward. #GetBrexitDone \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 pic.twitter.com/Uo1Nn3GMOE \u2014 Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) October 22, 2019\n\nAcross the Atlantic ocean, US President Donald Trump had better news for the global market. He tweeted on Monday that the trade deal with China was coming along very well. China\u2019s vice foreign minister Le Yucheng confirmed the same early Tuesday, sending the Asian equities higher alongside Bitcoin.\n\nThe Bulls Theory\n\nAway from the cryptocurrency exchanges, people in the Asian region have already started stockpiling bitcoin as their fear of a recession rises. Cryptocurrency Investment Firm ID Theory found that the Chinese have dumped almost $2.9 million worth of yuan for bitcoin. In India, an economy also facing one of its worst slowdowns in two decades, peer-to-peer traders have exchanged almost $1 million worth of Indian Rupees for bitcoin.\n\nNevertheless, the biggest crypto funders have maintained their distance from bitcoin for a while. Volumes of Bakkt\u2019s physically-settled bitcoin futures continue to remain lower, showing investors\u2019 constant focus on traditional assets. At the same time, cash-settled bitcoin futures\u2019 volume is growing higher on CME, with the latest data showing investors\u2019 mounting Long positions.\n\nLong positions held by institutional accounts at the CME have been rising again in October. For reference, institutions include pension funds, endowments, insurance companies, mutual funds & portfolio/investment managers whose clients are predominantly institutional. pic.twitter.com/96N2XZwo9e \u2014 skew (@skew_markets) October 20, 2019\n\nAn increase in Long positions is a bullish sign for bitcoin\u2019s retail markets.", "description": "Bitcoin was maintaining its weekend gains on Tuesday as investors assess positive outcomes from the ongoing US-China trade talks but remained uncertain", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1524050594-1200x780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
