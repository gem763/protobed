I hope you get to see it and I hope you get to see it soon,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he added: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a great precedent to be releasing calls with foreign countries, heads of foreign countries. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a great precedent.\u201d\n\nLate on Monday, the Washington Post reported that Trump ordered his acting chief of staff to withhold $400 million (\u00a3321.6 million) in military aid for Ukraine a week before the phone call with Zelenskiy, citing three senior administration officials.\n\nOne official told the Post that the decision to withhold the funds was based on corruption concerns and denied any link between blocking the money and pressing the Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens.\n\nDEMOCRATS SEEK DOCUMENTS\n\nDemocratic leaders of the House of Representatives have called a caucus meeting for Tuesday afternoon to discuss the whistleblower complaint, a leadership aide said.\n\nCongressional Democrats demanded documents on Monday from the White House about the Trump team\u2019s contacts with Ukraine.\n\nThree House committees - Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight - called on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to produce documents related to contacts between Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe Democratic-led committees said in a letter that they \u201cjointly request documents related to reported efforts by President Trump and his associates to improperly pressure the Ukrainian government to assist the president\u2019s bid for reelection.\u201d\n\nSeven first-term Democratic lawmakers also inched closer to calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment, writing in a Washington Post op-ed: \u201cIf these allegations are true, we believe these actions represent an impeachable offence.\u201d\n\nTrump hit out on Monday at Biden, calling him and his son \u201ccorrupt.\u201d\n\nNeither the president nor aides have provided any details of possible corruption by Biden when he was vice president under Trump\u2019s predecessor, Democratic President Barack Obama.\n\nThere has been no evidence so far that Biden used his position as vice president to help his son, and he said in Iowa on Saturday that he had never spoken to his son about his business dealings in Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian officials, while acknowledging they had met with Giuliani, have not said that they would open any investigation of Biden or his son.\n\nUkraine\u2019s former general prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Reuters on Friday that there was no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Biden\u2019s son in his relationship with the energy firm.\n\nJULY 25 CALL\n\nThe Wall Street Journal and the New York Times reported on Friday that Trump repeatedly asked the Ukrainian leader in the phone call to investigate the involvement of Biden\u2019s son with the company. He also asked Zelenskiy to work with Giuliani, who had been urging Ukrainian officials to investigate the Bidens.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump acknowledged that he discussed Biden and his son in the July 25 call.\n\nRepublican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate Intelligence Committee was working to get the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general to speak to the panel to discuss the whistleblower\u2019s allegations.\n\nA Senate aide said a briefing with the panel\u2019s chairman and vice chairman was expected this week.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump responds to reporter's questions as he departs to Texas from the White House, Washington, DC, U.S., September 22, 2019. REUTERS/Mike Theiler\n\nThe media reports about the phone call said Trump repeatedly asked Zelenskiy to investigate whether Biden misused his position as vice president to threaten to withhold U.S. aid unless a prosecutor who was looking into the gas company in which Biden\u2019s son was involved was fired.\n\nBiden has confirmed he wanted the prosecutor fired but denies it was to help his son. Biden said the wider U.S. government, the European Union and other international institutions also wanted the prosecutor fired for his alleged failure to pursue major corruption cases.\n\nA top official in Zelenskiy\u2019s administration told Reuters that Ukraine wanted to stay out of the domestic political battle in Washington and that any attempt by either side to take advantage of Ukraine would damage relations.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday denied trying to coerce Ukraine into investigating his Democratic rival Joe Biden, but wavered about whether he would release a transcript of a phone call that some Democrats say is grounds for his impeachment.", "authors": ["Patricia Zengerle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433154685&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1DR", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
