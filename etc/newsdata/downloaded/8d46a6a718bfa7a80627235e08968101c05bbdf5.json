Cory Booker. | Scott Olson/Getty Images 2020 Elections Booker takes the case for impeachment to 'Fox & Friends'\n\nSen. Cory Booker took the case for impeaching President Donald Trump to Fox News Wednesday morning, laying out the case on the president's favorite morning show for the Congressional inquiry announced one day earlier.\n\nThe New Jersey senator and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate's Fox News appearance came on \"Fox & Friends,\" the morning cable news show where the president is the regular recipient of flattering coverage. But Booker, in a one-on-one interview with host Steve Doocy, argued in favor of Trump's impeachment, a step the senator has long endorsed on the primary campaign trail.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThis is not a gleeful moment for this country,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very sad moment. This is not about politics. This is about patriotism.\u201d\n\nTrump has come under heavy criticism over the last week over revelations that he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a top contender in the Democratic primary field, and his son, Hunter Biden. The president has insisted that his conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart was totally appropriate but has thus far refused to release an intelligence community whistleblower report on the call, although the White House has signaled that it may do so.\n\nDemocrats have argued that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence is legally obligated to hand over the whistleblower report to Congress, an assessment the Trump administration has disputed.\n\n\u201cThe public doesn't know the truth yet,\u201d he said. \u201cRelease his report. By the way, not doing it is a violation of the law.\u201d\n\nNew Window INTERACTIVE: See where House lawmakers stand on impeachment\n\nThat pressure crested Tuesday evening with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's announcement that Congress would begin a formal impeachment inquiry into the president, alleging that he sought to pressure a foreign government into digging up political dirt on a potential 2020 rival.\n\nBooker echoed the call of many fellow Democrats for the White House to release the transcript of Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelensky, a step the Trump administration took later Wednesday morning.\n\nHe also pushed back against Doocy's argument that the impeachment inquiry is premature because Congress had not yet seen the call transcript, retorting that former President Richard Nixon enjoyed initial public support until impeachment proceedings uncovered information related to the Watergate scandal that led to his resignation.\n\nDoocy pressed Booker to consider the Republicans\u2019 argument about whether Joe Biden was involved in corruption in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThis is almost like saying okay, here's a firecracker over here,\u201d the senator replied. \u201cPay no attention to nuclear bomb going off that a president of the United States of America, in order to pursue his own personal benefit, withholds aid from an ally under attack.\u201d", "description": "In a one-on-one interview with host Steve Doocy, Booker argued in favor of Trump's impeachment.", "authors": ["Abbey Marshall"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/dc/e6/696be7a749d6896e2f2f600cbe0d/190925-cory-booker-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
