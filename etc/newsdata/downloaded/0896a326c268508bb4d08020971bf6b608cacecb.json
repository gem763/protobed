Photo: Earwolf\n\nThe comedy-podcast universe is ever expanding, not unlike the universe universe. We\u2019re here to make it a bit smaller, a bit more manageable. There are a lot of great shows, and each one has a lot of great episodes, so we want to highlight the exceptional, the noteworthy. Each week, our crack team of podcast enthusiasts and specialists and especially enthusiastic people will pick their favorites. We hope to have your ears permanently plugged with the best in aural comedy.\n\nConan O\u2019Brien Needs a Friend - David Letterman\n\nThe sophomore season of Conan O\u2019Brien Needs a Friend starts this week, and O\u2019Brien is kicking it off with the man he identifies as being responsible for helping to hone the sensibilities of a generation of comedians: David Letterman. O\u2019Brien reveals that he once submitted comedy material to his guest\u2019s NBC late-night show in hopes of landing his first TV writing job \u2026 and was crushed when he didn\u2019t get it. Letterman commiserates with him but also points out everything that might not have happened for O\u2019Brien if he had landed the gig. There\u2019s a bit of delving into Letterman\u2019s early days, but it\u2019s more about what he\u2019s been doing \u2014 and thinking \u2014 since closing the tent on his CBS nighttime talker. Sure, there\u2019s the Netflix show (My Next Guest Needs No Introduction), but there\u2019s more about something he never let himself do when the TV crush was on: simply enjoying life, and life at home with his son, Harry. And that gets both hosts going off about the positive influence their children have on them in terms of showing them what\u2019s most important. There are a number of funny stories throughout this hour-long chat, but the best comes toward the end, when we learn that Letterman sent O\u2019Brien a horse when his NBC show was wrapping up. A blue-eyed crazy \u201cshow horse\u201d that O\u2019Brien still tends to and cares for to this day. \u2014Marc Hershon\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nCouples Therapy - Crush Hashana\n\nImagine wanting to hear two people talk about their relationship. Sounds insane, right? Well, Couples Therapy co-hosts and real-life couple Naomi Ekperigin and Andy Beckerman know how to make wanting to hear people talk about their relationships not only reality, but a riot. It\u2019s a promise they make good on in the first five minutes of this episode, when they dive right into Andy\u2019s goal to really crush it in the Jewish New Year 5780, and Naomi\u2019s attempts to get more comfortable driving in L.A. Spoiler alert: The driving part isn\u2019t going that well, landing them in what Naomi calls \u201ca Green Book situation, which is not good for our love, at all.\u201d And, like any couple worth hanging out with, Andy and Naomi know to not make everything about them, sharing sets from other couples in their Couples Therapy live show. The couples featured in the live shows range from lovers and ex-lovers to friends and comedy partners, and whatever\u2019s left in between. The first set featured this week are two longtime friends, Andy Kindler and Wayne Federman, who celebrate their 30-year friendship by doing each other\u2019s material from their early days. Then, at the other end of that is Sara Schaefer and Charla Lauriston, figuring out the dynamics of their fairly new friendship as they recount what could have been a harrowing weekend at a comedy condo had they not had each other to get through it. Did all of that make you go, \u201cAawwww\u201d? That\u2019s because Couples Therapy is the perfect mix of touching and hilarious to warm even the coldest of hearts. \u2014Leigh Cesiro\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nScream, Queen! - Black History Is Black Horror\n\nIt\u2019s spooky season, and new podcast Scream, Queen! is here to offer insightful takes on scary movies. More specifically, hosts Tommy Pico (Food 4 Thot) and Drea Washington \u201cdish about what goes bump in the night \u2014 from a black/queer/indigenous perspective\u2014and have a damn good time.\u201d It\u2019s the latter note that will get you laughing. As the hosts analyze horror movies, they crack wise about the absurd tropes that often plague the genre, bringing their impressive love for horror to three distinct segments. First is \u201cHave Y\u2019all Seen,\u201d which relies on Washington\u2019s encyclopedic knowledge of scary movies to generate lesser-known recommendations. This week it\u2019s Society, an \u201980s bawdy body-horror flick, which lends itself well to riffing given that involves, among other horrors, \u201ca face coming out of a man\u2019s butthole.\u201d The second segment normally takes an in-depth look at a single film. Previously covered gems include Child\u2019s Play and The Faculty. This week, however, Pico and Washington go deep on Horror Noir: A History of Blackness in Scary Movies, which opens the conversation up to other titles, including Blacula and Get Out. Lastly, the third segment sees the duo discussing a favorite scream queen, which concludes the show\u2019s effortless flow. \u2014Becca James\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nRoundball Rock - Central Division Preview\n\nIn just under two weeks, comedian and pro roaster Blake Griffin will kick off a six-month, 28-city journey as part of the epic \u201c2019-20 NBA Season\u201d tour. Until then, analysts and comedians in their own right, Joey Devine and Sean Keane, are here with their thoroughly hilarious division previews. The world\u2019s foremost Tilman Fertitta enthusiasts lead off with a highly relevant rendition of recurring segment \u201cTilman Time,\u201d about the Houston Rockets owner\u2019s involvement in this week\u2019s NBA-China scandal. The Central Division preview runs through all the pressing Bucks, Pacers, Pistons, Bulls, and Cavaliers topics even the most diehard NBA fans haven\u2019t thought of, covering questions like, \u201cWill the Lopez twins\u2019 cat-related infighting and difference of opinions on the third act of Avengers: Endgame tear the [Bucks] locker room apart?\u201d and \u201cIs Victor Oladipo Thingamajig from The Masked Singer?\u201d Keane and Devine sandwich the jokes with legit insight, but the real analysis comes in the fourth quarter during another episode of Slamm\u2019d Up. Stat nerds \u201cBrett Slammson\u201d and two-inch tall \u201cRandy LeDoux\u201d bust out the spreadsheets in a 100 percent accurate parody of serious mainstream NBA podcasts, down to the soulless corporate sponsors (\u201cChina is bae\u201d). Roundball Rock remains an excellent alt-comedy supplement to the basketball season. \u2014Mark Kramer\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nThe Endless Honeymoon Podcast - Live from the High Plains Comedy Festival with Kate Willett and Baron Vaughn\n\nWhen Natasha Leggero and Moshe Kasher launched their Endless Honeymoon tour in 2016, they really took that title to heart. Three years later, the married couple launched the Endless Honeymoon podcast loosely based on the third act of their tour in which the veteran comics, after solo sets, joined each other onstage in matrimonial bliss to give relationship advice to willing couples. The format hasn\u2019t changed much since their first live recording of the podcast at the High Plains Comedy Festival. First, the couple gives an update on their life, which like many episodes this summer, involves Moshe\u2019s yearly Burning Man trip and the couple RV-ing around the country with their young baby (jokingly named \u201cMaterial\u201d in a NYT profile). Then they open it up to relationship advice. But this episode doesn\u2019t just have couples seeking Talmudic counsel on how to fit Dungeons & Dragons and lengthy Rosh Hashanah services into their marriage. There\u2019s also a segment in which callers left voicemails seeking non-relationship advice, most notably a white man who took mushrooms on a Connecticut beach and thought he was black. Moshe and Natasha left that to Baron Vaughn to answer, and he did, in a succinct two-word reply that I can\u2019t write myself but sums up that idiot pretty well! \u2014Pablo Goldstein\n\nListen: Apple | Website\n\nOther Podcasts We\u2019re Listening To:\n\nPod Don\u2019t Lie - Shaq gets racist, more Super Head, & Hornets memories with Roy Wood Jr.\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nAnna Faris is Unqualified - Lilly Singh\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nBest Friends - Sasheer Will Have a Glass of Hot Water with Lauren Lapkus & Laura Willcox\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nYou\u2019re Making It Worse - Ilana Glazer\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nSuperego - Episode 5:1\n\nListen: Apple | Website\n\nThe Honey Dew - Josh Potter\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nGot a comedy podcast recommendation?
