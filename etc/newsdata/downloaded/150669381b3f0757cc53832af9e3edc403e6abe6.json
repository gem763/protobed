(\u201cSandfire America\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d, Trading symbols- TSX.V:SFR and OTCQB:SRAFF) is pleased to provide the following announcement related to an updated Mineral Resource estimate for the Black Butte Copper Project, a proposed underground mine located in Montana, USA.\n\nCEO and VP of Project Development Rob Scargill stated: \u201cThe updated Mineral Resource estimate, supported by substantial new drill data and geometallurgical investigation, allows project evaluation to proceed using data in which we have an increased level of confidence that will underpin upcoming studies on the Black Butte Copper Project.\u201d\n\nThe updated Mineral Resource statement for the Johnny Lee Deposit is summarized in Table 1. This Mineral Resource statement is based upon the Preliminary Economic Assessment (effective date: July 12, 2013) further supported by additional drilling, analyses, geological modeling, and extensive metallurgical studies to provide updated recoveries.\n\nTable 1: Mineral Resource Estimate for the Johnny Lee Deposit as of October 15, 2019.\n\nCategory Quantity\n\n(Mt) Cu (%) Total\n\nMetal (kt) UCZ Measured 1.4 2.6 36.2 Indicated 8.3 2.3 191.3 Measured and Indicated 9.7 2.4 227.5 Inferred 2.2 2.2 49.5 LCZ Measured 0.6 5.7 32.9 Indicated 0.6 7.9 50.5 Measured and Indicated 1.2 6.8 83.4 Inferred 0.5 6.3 30.3 Combined UCZ + LCZ Measured 2.0 3.5 69.1 Indicated 8.9 2.7 241.8 Measured and Indicated 10.9 2.9 310.9 Inferred 2.7 3.0 79.7\n\nSource: SRK, 2019\n\nThe effective date for this Mineral Resource is October 15, 2019. All significant figures are rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimates. Copper assay values were capped where appropriate;\n\nMineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. Inferred Mineral Resources have a high degree of uncertainty as to their economic and technical feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an Inferred Mineral Resources can be upgraded to Measured or Indicated Mineral Resources;\n\nMetallurgical recovery of copper has been estimated on a block basis in the UCZ, averaging 77.4%, with a consistent 94.0% Cu recovery applied to the LCZ;\n\nTo demonstrate reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction of Mineral Resources, a cut-off grade of 1.00% copper based on metal recoverability assumptions, long-term copper price assumptions of $3.20/lb, mining costs, processing costs, G&A costs totaling $71/t;\n\nThere are no known legal, political, environmental, or other risks that could materially affect the potential development of the Mineral Resources other than those outlined in the Management Discussion and Analyses of the June 2019 Company Quarterly Report. All Mineral Resources are located within land currently under control or lease to Sandfire Resources America Inc.\n\nThe 2019 Mineral Resource update was supervised and reviewed by SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. (SRK) and represents the following notable changes in the defined Mineral Resource from the previously defined Mineral Resource estimate contained within the Updated Technical Report and Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Black Butte Copper Project, Montana (effective date: July 12, 2013) due to the following key factors:\n\nAdditional drilling, analytical data, geological and structural modeling, and interpretation of geological and mineralization for improved confidence;\n\nExtensive metallurgical and geometallurgical studies have allowed for estimates of copper recovery that have a higher level of confidence than previously assumed;\n\nRemoval of Co, Ag, and Au by-products as recent metallurgical test work has indicated that froth flotation does not produce a copper concentrate with cobalt, silver, or gold in payable concentrations; and\n\nUpdated cut-off grade used to define the Mineral Resource using recent metallurgical recovery assumptions for copper and updated price assumptions.\n\nIntroduction\n\nSandfire Resources America Inc. (the Company) is pleased to announce that an updated Mineral Resource estimate has been completed using significant additional drill data for the Johnny Lee Deposit, Black Butte Copper Project, Montana, USA. The updated Mineral Resource has been prepared following the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy, and Petroleum (CIM) guidelines.\n\nThe Mineral Resource estimate incorporates drill data from 140 diamond drillholes completed by its predecessors and, 48 diamond drillholes completed by the Company. The Mineral Resource estimate has been reviewed and approved by SRK of Denver, Colorado, USA under the supervision of Erik Ronald, an Independent Qualified Person under NI 43-101.\n\nTwenty-two metallurgical composite samples, constructed from fourteen drillholes completed by the Company, were used to conduct an extensive metallurgical test work program for the Johnny Lee deposit. The metallurgical test results have been integrated with systematic mineralogy of drillhole samples to develop a metallurgical copper recovery model for the Johnny Lee deposit. Metallurgical testing was conducted at Base Metallurgical Laboratories (Kamloops, British Columbia) under the supervision of Dr. Deepak Malhotra of Resource Development Incorporated, an Independent Qualified Person under NI 43-101.\n\nThe Mineral Resource was prepared in accordance with CIM Definition Standards and will be supported by a NI 43-101 Technical Report to be published and filed on the Company\u2019s website and SEDAR profile within 45 days.\n\nJohnny Lee Deposit\n\nThe Johnny Lee copper deposit is formed by two zones of mineralization: An Upper Copper Zone (\u201cUCZ\u201d) situated at depths of 40 m \u2013 210 m below surface and an underlying Lower Copper Zone (\u201cLCZ\u201d) at depths of 340 m - 520 m below surface. A Mine Operating Plan (\u201cMOP\u201d) Application for the extraction of mineralized rock from both Zones of the Johnny Lee deposit was submitted to the Montana Department of Environmental Quality (\u201cMT DEQ\u201d) in December 2015 and following revisions was deemed complete and compliant. A draft MOP permit was issued by the Hard Rock Mining Bureau MT DEQ on September 18, 2017 and the Environmental Impact Statement process started soon thereafter. The MOP proposes underground mining of the Johnny Lee Deposit using a drift and fill mining method and production of a copper concentrate by milling and froth flotation. Mill tailings will be used for underground paste-fill support and the surplus deposited in a double lined cemented tailings storage facility.\n\nResource Estimation Methodology and Parameters\n\nAn extensive quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) program was implemented in order to support the Mineral Resource estimate. Diamond drill core sampling intervals were continuously collected from above the mineralization zones to the end of each drillhole. HQ (2.5 inch) diamond core was sawn into half-core samples for copper analyses. Diamond drill core analyses for copper mineralization was performed at ALS Laboratories (ALS) in Reno, Nevada and metallurgical testing at Base Metallurgical Laboratories in Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada. Approximately 20% of the submitted samples consisted of QA/QC samples including: duplicates, blanks, and certified Reference Materials (CRM). All QA/QC, sampling, drilling, and analytical methodologies have been deemed acceptable by the QP for use in determination of Mineral Resources as per CIM guidelines.\n\nGeological continuity of up to eight, vertically stacked, shallow dipping >1.2% copper mineralized layers in the UCZ has been demonstrated and modeled as wireframe domains in three-dimensions (3D). The >1.2% copper domains in the UCZ are encapsulated within a zone of >0.25% copper mineralization modeled in 3D as wireframe volumes.\n\nCopper mineralization within the LCZ occurs within three discrete >2.0% copper lenses that occur at approximately the same elevation. Each of these lenses has been modeled in 3D as separate wireframe volumes. Compositing and capping were utilized for copper grade estimated into each modeled domain using Ordinary Kriging for both the UCZ and LCZ. Density was estimated into the block model by domain using Ordinary Kriging of composited data. The block models were used to constrain the tonnage and copper grade estimations for the Mineral Resource estimate.\n\nCopper Recovery Estimation\n\nMetallurgical test work using UCZ composites has shown that copper recoveries, using the optimized recovery process, are highly variable. Mineralogical investigation of UCZ metallurgical composites has demonstrated that this variability is due to differences in copper sulfide liberation characteristics. The estimated copper recoveries determined from copper sulfide liberation metrics have been interpolated into a block model using an inverse distance weighting squared process. Estimated copper recoveries for the UCZ range from 68.2% to 87.9%.\n\nHistoric and recent metallurgical test work for the LCZ has demonstrated relatively high recoveries with low variability. Accordingly, a 94.0% copper recovery has been applied to the LCZ model.\n\nDetermination of Cut-off Grade for Resource\n\nTo demonstrate the prospect of eventual economic extraction of Mineral Resources, SRK applied a cut-off grade that accounts for metallurgical recovery of copper, operational costs, and market-driven copper pricing. The following technical and economic parameters are assumed and accounted for in the determination of cut-off grade:\n\nMetallurgical recoveries: Estimated variable copper recovery for the UCZ. Assigned mean 94% copper recovery for the LCZ.\n\nOperational Costs: US$71/tonne. This includes mining, processing and general and administrative costs.\n\nCopper Price: A long term copper price of US$3.20 per pound (US$7,055 per metric tonne) is based on market consensus forecast for upside copper pricing.\n\nUsing these metrics, a cut-off grade of 1.0% Cu based on recovery assumptions was used for the entire Johnny Lee deposit.\n\nQualified Persons\n\nThe technical information contained in this announcement related to the Johnny Lee Deposit has been reviewed and approved by Erik Ronald, M.
