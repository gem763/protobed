The center has already occupied a portion of the space for the past several months and has offered a number of events and presentations during that time.\n\nThe construction project and some programmatic initiatives will be funded with a $50 million capital campaign, officials said. The target date for completing construction is the fall of 2021, officials added.\n\nAliko Dangote Photo: Wei Leng Tay/Bloomberg News\n\nThe capital campaign has been jump-started with a $20 million contribution from the Aliko Dangote Foundation.\n\nMr. Dangote is a Nigerian businessman and investor. According to Forbes, he has a current net worth of $9.2 billion, making him the richest man in Africa.\n\nCenter officials called his gift one of the largest-known donations of its kind by an African philanthropist to a U.S. nonprofit organization.\n\nHalima Dangote, Mr. Dangote\u2019s daughter and a trustee of the Dangote Foundation, said the gift is being made with the hope that the center can \u201cfoster a greater understanding of Africa\u201d with its diverse programming. Ms. Dangote is also president of the Africa Center\u2019s board.\n\nIn addition to the gift from the Dangote Foundation, the center has received $5 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, officials said.\n\nThe center is being designed with as much flexibility as possible, officials said. While spaces will allow for everything from forums on current events to concerts and art shows, the idea isn\u2019t to create fixed galleries, as is the case with most museums.\n\nThe flexible design is also intended to make the center feel inviting, particularly to the nearby Harlem community, officials said.\n\nParticipants inside the portal installation communicated with another participant in Lagos via live video at the Africa Center Sept. 18.

You don\u2019t feel straitjacketed,\u201d said Uzodinma Iweala, a writer, filmmaker and medical doctor who has served as the center\u2019s chief executive officer since last year. Mr. Iweala is the author of \u201cBeasts of No Nation,\u201d the 2005 novel that was made into a film a decade later.\n\nThe center\u2019s programming is being aimed to create a new narrative around Africa that goes beyond the stories of political strife and economic hardship that often define the continent, Mr. Iweala added.\n\nIn the past year, the center has hosted book talks and readings with African authors, conducted workshops devoted to the traditional West African art of painting on glass and held a community dialogue on gender-based violence, xenophobia and other subjects.\n\nThe center was previously known as the Museum for African Art, with a history going back to 1984. Over the years, the museum had homes in different parts of the city, including spaces in SoHo and Long Island City.\n\nThe museum broadened its mission in 2013 and changed its name as a result. At the same time, it talked up plans to fully develop and settle into its new home at the space on 110th Street and Fifth Avenue by 2015.\n\nThe plan took longer because of its sheer ambitious nature, said Hadeel Ibrahim, the center\u2019s co-chair. In the past few years, the center has focused especially on developing its board, she added.\n\nAmong the additions to the board is Chelsea Clinton, who serves as the other co-chair.\n\nThe center\u2019s plans are being embraced by a host of cultural organizations in the city.\n\nMahen Bonetti, founder and executive director of the African Film Festival Inc., a New York-based presenter of cinematic events, noted that it isn\u2019t unusual to have institutions devoted to the life and culture of such European countries as Italy and France. But Africa is just as significant, if not more so, she said.\n\nIt \u201cis an entire continent,\u201d she said.\n\nWrite to Charles Passy at cpassy@wsj.com", "description": "More than six years after the Africa Center announced a broad mission to explore the continent through cultural, business and public-policy programming, the organization is taking steps to fulfill that goal.", "authors": ["Charles Passy"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108994/social", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
