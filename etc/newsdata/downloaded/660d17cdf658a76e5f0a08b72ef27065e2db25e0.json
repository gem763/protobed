Barr has held private meetings overseas with foreign intelligence officials seeking their help in a Justice Department inquiry that Trump hopes will discredit U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\n\u25cfThe Ukraine story appears to be hurting Trump \u2014 and possibly Biden, too.\n\nRead the whistleblower complaint | The rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky | Related coverage and analysis of the Trump impeachment inquiry\n\n8:45 p.m.: Giuliani continues to get blowback from some Republicans\n\nTrump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, has come under criticism from some Republicans for his unpredictable TV appearances and his efforts to press Ukraine to investigate Biden.\n\nOn Tuesday night, he continued to face blowback.\n\n\u201cI think it was a mistake to dispatch him on some kind of diplomatic mission,\u201d Fox News Channel legal analyst Andrew Napolitano said of Giuliani, who was issued a subpoena by four House committee chairs on Monday.\n\nWhile it remains unclear whether Giuliani was acting as an attorney or as a diplomat during his visits to Ukraine and elsewhere, Napolitano said, \u201cif Rudy was acting as a diplomat, then there\u2019s no privilege in his communications.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suspect we\u2019re going to hear less from Rudy, because he now has a lawyer \u2026 who will basically say, \u2018Mr. Mayor, zip it,\u2019\u201d he added.\n\n7:50 p.m.: Trump hauls out the rhetorical heavy artillery, accuses Democrats of \u2018COUP\u2019\n\nIn Tuesday night tweets, Trump escalated his attacks on Democrats, arguing that \u201cwhat is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP.\u201d\n\nDemocrats\u2019 actions, he claimed, are \u201cintended to take away the Power of the People, their VOTE, their Freedoms, their Second Amendment, Religion, Military, Border Wall, and their God-given rights as a Citizen of The United States of America!\u201d\n\nThe president is bringing the rhetorical heavy artillery to the most serious challenge to his presidency in nearly three tumultuous, norm-busting, warp-speed years in office.\n\nExpanding on the lexicon of outrage and victimhood honed during the probe into Russian interference in the last election, Trump is invoking the muskets-and-ramparts idioms of the country\u2019s beginnings.\n\nThe ratcheting up of his rhetoric is also indicative of Trump\u2019s tendency to interpret any criticism of him as an attack on the government, worrying critics and scholars who warn of the dangers posed by his l\u2019\u00e9tat, c\u2019est moi call to arms.\n\nRead more here .\n\n\u2014 Anne Gearan\n\n7:30 p.m.: Schiff will appear at Pelosi\u2019s weekly presser\n\nIntelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) will join House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) for her weekly news conference on Wednesday, Pelosi\u2019s office announced Tuesday night.\n\nSchiff has become the public face of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment push, and most Democrats see the intelligence panel as a more appropriate venue than the House Judiciary Committee for investigating Trump\u2019s efforts to push Ukraine to investigate Biden.\n\n6:25 p.m.: What can Congress do if Mike Pompeo won\u2019t cooperate with its impeachment inquiry?\n\nA major early step of the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry is to talk to the top administration officials who would have had knowledge about Trump\u2019s work with Ukraine.\n\nBut like a number of other high-profile Trump administration officials, Pompeo is resisting. And Congress may not have a lot of options left to force potentially key players in its impeachment inquiry to speak to it. The rule book for how to be a check on the executive branch doesn\u2019t include an executive branch unwilling to cooperate.\n\nPompeo is staking his argument on both procedural and political grounds. Procedurally, he accuses Democrats of not providing a technical document, called a Notice of Deposition, to have his staff testify. He says they were not given enough time, and he is demanding that State Department lawyers be present during testimony to assert executive privilege.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Amber Phillips\n\n6:00 p.m.: Pro-impeachment group to spend $3.1 million targeting Senate Republicans\n\nA group pushing for Trump\u2019s impeachment is launching a $3.1 million ad campaign targeting Republican senators over the coming weeks -- the first major pro-impeachment advocacy spending since the House launched their formal inquiry last week.\n\nThe group, Need to Impeach, is funded mainly by billionaire Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer. Top executives said Tuesday that it will spend more than half of the overall campaign total on television ads, with the rest underwriting digital ads.\n\nTargeted by the campaign are GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Martha McSally of Arizona, all of whom are seeking reelection next year and could cast votes in the coming months on whether Trump should be removed from office.\n\n\u201cWith all that our country stands for, how can we have a president who thinks the law doesn\u2019t apply to him?\u201d a voiceover says in a sample ad provided to The Washington Post ahead of a scheduled Thursday debut. \u201cWho would bargain away the security of our nation and our elections for his own political gain?

Following the release of a whistle-blower complaint claiming abuse of power by President Donald Trump, the House Democratic leadership announced this week that it is launching a formal impeachment inquiry. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) 5:15 p.m.: Volker, Yovanovitch will appear before House panels this week\n\nKurt Volker, the former Trump administration special envoy to Ukraine, has confirmed that he will appear Thursday before the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight Committees, according to an official on one of the panels.\n\nVolker had held the Ukraine job part-time for the past two years until his resignation last week.\n\nFormer U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who had originally been scheduled to appear before the committees Wednesday, will instead appear Oct. 11, according to the official.\n\nYovanovitch was recalled from her position in Ukraine this year amid a flurry of political attacks by conservative media and other allies of Trump, including Giuliani, who targeted her with wild accusations and argued that she \u201cshould be part of the investigation as part of the collusion.\u201d\n\n5 p.m.: State Department inspector general to meet with Hill committees Wednesday\n\nKey committees on Capitol Hill were notified Tuesday that the State Department\u2019s inspector general has requested to speak with them Wednesday \u201cto discuss and provide staff with copies of documents related to the State Department and Ukraine,\u201d according to a letter obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nThe offer by the office of Steve Linick, which operates mostly independently from the State Department and is responsible for investigating abuse and mismanagement, comes amid a standoff between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and House Democrats demanding documents and testimony on Ukraine-related matters for their impeachment inquiry.\n\nLinick\u2019s office \u201cobtained the documents from the acting legal adviser of the Department of State,\u201d the letter said. The inspector general doesn\u2019t have to seek Pompeo\u2019s approval to approach the Hill with information, especially if it is not classified.\n\nIt is unclear exactly what Linick will provide the committees, which include the panels in charge of foreign relations, intelligence, appropriations and oversight in the House and Senate. But the demand for any credible information related to Ukraine and the State Department is at a fever pitch as Democrats seek to build the case for Trump\u2019s ouster out of his dealings with Ukraine\u2019s leadership.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Pompeo suggested that Foggy Bottom would not acquiesce with Democratic lawmakers\u2019 demands to interview several State Department officials, alleging \u201cserious substantive and procedural deficiencies\u201d with their investigation.\n\nHe said Democrats were trying to \u201cintimidate\u201d and \u201cbully\u201d his colleagues at the State Department.\n\n\u2014 Karoun Demirjian and John Hudson\n\n4:30 p.m.: Hillary Clinton to Giuliani: \u2018Yes, I am famously under-scrutinized.\u2019\n\nGiuliani tweeted that the news media is attacking him because he\u2019s the messenger and it wants to cover up the message of \u201cDem corruption.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, they have yet to ask Biden difficult questions because he is protected and immune like the Clintons and crooked Clinton Foundation!\u201d Giuliani wrote.\n\nTo which Hillary Clinton responded, on Twitter, \u201cYes, I am famously under-scrutinized.\u201d\n\nThere is, of course, no shortage of controversies that dogged Clinton and her husband during their decades in public life. In fact, an investigation into the Clintons\u2019 real estate investments, famously known as the Whitewater scandal, led investigators to Monica Lewinksy and resulted in President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment over his lying under oath and obstruction of justice.\n\n4:25 p.m.: Sen. Menendez questions Pence, Rick Perry roles in Trump\u2019s Ukraine controversy\n\nSen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) sent letters to Vice President Pence and Energy Secretary Rick Perry inquiring about whether they had any role in Trump\u2019s asking Ukraine for information that could help him in the 2020 election.\n\nIn his letter to Pence, Menendez noted the vice president\u2019s canceled trip to Ukrainian President Zelensky\u2019s inauguration and then his meeting with Zelensky in September. Menendez\u2019s letter questions whether Pence spoke to Zelensky about the hold on U.S. military assistance and the desire for information about former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s son.\n\nMenendez, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also asked Perry, who went to the inauguration in Pence\u2019s place, how it came about that he led the delegation and whether Trump had asked him to relay a message to any Ukrainian officials about getting assistance in investigating Biden.\n\n3:50 p.m.: Waters says impeachment inquiry may not be limited to Ukraine\n\nRep. Maxine Waters, chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, said despite Pelosi talking about focusing the impeachment inquiry on Trump and Ukraine, Waters said a final decision about what to include has not been made.\n\n\u201cI still have an opportunity as one of the six committees involved in investigating him to help basically determine what is going to go into the impeachment resolution. The six of us will be getting together with our information that we will place on the table and with the speaker,\u201d Waters said in an interview.\n\nWaters also said she\u2019s \u201cvery pleased that Trump is finally being caught in some actions that has caused not only Nancy Pelosi to reverse her thinking about impeachment but it is also gotten us to the point where we have support from basically all of our caucus, or most of our caucus, and the American people, it appears.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Vanessa Williams\n\n2:30 p.m.: House chairmen say Pompeo should \u2018immediately cease intimidating\u2019 witnesses\n\nThe chairmen of three House committees responded to Pompeo in a statement Tuesday afternoon in which they called on the secretary of state to \u201cimmediately cease intimidating\u201d State Department witnesses \u201cin order to protect himself and the President.\u201d\n\nThe statement from House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), Schiff and Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) came after Pompeo said that State Department officials would not show up for their scheduled depositions this week.\n\n\u201cSecretary Pompeo was reportedly on the call when the President pressed Ukraine to smear his political opponent,\u201d the chairmen said. \u201cIf true, Secretary Pompeo is now a fact witness in the House impeachment inquiry. He should immediately cease intimidating Department witnesses in order to protect himself and the President.\u201d\n\nThey added that \u201cany effort to intimidate witnesses or prevent them from talking with Congress \u2014 including State Department employees \u2014 is illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn response, Congress may infer from this obstruction that any withheld documents and testimony would reveal information that corroborates the whistleblower complaint,\u201d they said.\n\n1:30 p.m.: Waters says Trump should be imprisoned and placed in solitary confinement\n\nRep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) said Tuesday that Trump should be imprisoned and placed in solitary confinement \u2014 but added impeachment \u201cis the imperative.\u201d\n\nWaters, chairwoman of the Financial Services Committee, reacted on Twitter to Trump\u2019s recent comments about unmasking the whistleblower and describing those who provided him with information as spies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling on the GOP to stop Trump\u2019s filthy talk of whistleblowers being spies & using mob language implying they should be killed,\u201d Waters tweeted. \u201cImpeachment is not good enough for Trump. He needs to be imprisoned & placed in solitary confinement. But for now, impeachment is the imperative.\u201d\n\n1:15 p.m.: GOP senator prepares bill intended to call out Hunter Biden\u2019s work in Ukraine; Democrat calls it a \u2018silly, political hit job\u2019\n\nSen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) said he plans to introduce a narrowly focused bill to ban immediate family members, specifically parents, children and siblings, of top U.S. political officials, including the president, the vice president, the president\u2019s Cabinet and members of Congress, from earning income in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe Ukraine government is historically corrupt, which is one way Russia exerts influence there,\u201d Kennedy said in a news release. \u201cThe best way to resist temptation is a proper upbringing, a strong set of values and tough laws.\u201d\n\nThough he doesn\u2019t name former vice president Joe Biden or his son Hunter, it\u2019s clear Kennedy\u2019s bill is an attempt to focus attention on Hunter Biden\u2019s former position on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Trump tried to obtain more information about Biden\u2019s work from the Ukrainian president during their July 25 call, which is now the subject of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) referred to Kennedy\u2019s bill as \u201cobviously a silly, political hit job.\u201d But he tweeted to his colleague that if Kennedy wants to \u201capply something like this to all foreign countries and make sure it applies to the President\u2019s kids too\u201d then to call him.\n\n12:45 p.m.: Republicans and Democrats spar over Pompeo accusations\n\nSeeking to discredit the impeachment inquiry, House Republicans seized on Pompeo\u2019s contention in a letter that Democratic staffers are trying to \u201cintimidate\u201d and \u201cbully\u201d State Department officials who play a role in U.S. relations with Ukraine.\n\n\u201cDemocrats have been trying to impeach the president since the day he was sworn in,\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said in a tweet. \u201cNow they\u2019re harassing civil servants at the State Department to try to achieve their objective. They\u2019re putting their own political interests ahead of the country.\u201d\n\nHis comments echoed those of two of Trump\u2019s closest Republican allies in Congress, Reps. Jim Jordan (Ohio) and Mark Meadows (N.C.).\n\nMeadows said in a tweet that Schiff had \u201cmade it clear House Democrats are willing to bully and intimidate career professionals as a means to their end goal of politically targeting @realDonaldTrump.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable. It\u2019s damaging to the country. We won\u2019t stand for it,\u201d Meadows added.\n\nDemocrats offered a far different take on Pompeo\u2019s letter, which relayed that five State Department employees would not show up this week for depositions requested by House committees.\n\n\u201cIf @realDonaldTrump and @SecPompeo were innocent, they would provide witnesses and information for the American people and Congress to clear their names,\u201d tweeted Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.). \u201cInstead, they are bullying the American people by obstructing Congress and hiding information.\u201d\n\n12:15 p.m.: RNC chairwoman accuses Democrats of a coup d\u2019etat\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel accused House Democrats of attempting a coup d\u2019etat Tuesday.\n\nMcDaniel took to Twitter to share an opinion piece written by former House speaker Newt Gingrich in which he argued that what Democrats are doing has \u201cnothing to do with an impeachment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a legislative coup d\u2019etat. It is an effort by the hard left, the news media, and the deep state to destroy the president chosen by the American people,\u201d Gingrich wrote.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more!\u201d McDaniel said in her tweet.\n\n12:05 p.m.: The Ukraine story appears to be hurting Trump \u2014 and possibly Biden, too\n\nThe Ukraine story has spurred Democrats to announce a formal impeachment inquiry of President Trump, and with those developments has come a noted rise in support for impeaching Trump.\n\nBut there remains considerable uncertainty among the American public about the Democrats\u2019 underlying Ukraine accusations, according to a new poll. And importantly, a plurality seems to be internalizing Trump and his personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani\u2019s dubious claims of potential wrongdoing by Joe Biden.\n\nThe Monmouth University poll shows people broadly disapprove of Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, on which Trump asked Ukraine to pursue two investigations that carry potential political benefits for him. Americans say 63 percent to 21 percent that it is \u201cnot appropriate\u201d for a president to make such requests of a foreign leader.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Aaron Blake\n\n12 p.m.: Impeachment inquiry energizing Trump\u2019s online donor base\n\nHouse Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry has generated a flurry of donations through WinRed, the new Republican donation platform designed to capitalize on Trump\u2019s fervent online donor base, officials said Tuesday.\n\nWinRed processed more than $13.7 million in donations from more than 276,000 contributors in the six days since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced the impeachment inquiry, officials said Tuesday. Hundreds of thousands of dollars flowed to House GOP \u201cnominee funds,\u201d officials said, referring to the vehicles that raise money for Republican challengers to vulnerable Democrats who support the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cTurning major news events into big time fundraising numbers is a key goal of WinRed \u2014 and we had a super-charged example of that last week after Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry against President Trump,\u201d WinRed President Gerrit Lansing wrote in a memo released Tuesday.\n\nSince Pelosi\u2019s announcement, Trump and GOP campaign committees have unleashed a massive push for donations in his defense, bombarding his supporters with appeals via emails, texts, tweets and videos. Such solicitations \u2014 often capitalizing on newsworthy moments for the president \u2014 have been a mainstay of Trump\u2019s fundraising strategy and have fueled his reelection effort.\n\nWinRed launched in June to make it easier for donors to give in smaller amounts online to multiple GOP candidates and causes, seeking to leverage Trump\u2019s appeal to such donors.\n\nSince then, some House GOP members have resisted adopting the platform, but WinRed officials said more campaigns are coming on board. So far, 60 percent of House GOP members, 76 percent of Republican senators and 92 percent of Republican state parties have adopted the platform, they said.\n\n\u2014 Michelle Ye Hee Lee\n\n11:45 a.m.: Corey Lewandowski suggests he won\u2019t run for Senate so he can help Trump\u2019s reelection bid\n\nTrump\u2019s former campaign manager and loyal ally Corey Lewandowski said \u201cit\u2019s fair to say\u201d his plans to run for the U.S. Senate in New Hampshire may have changed now that Trump is at the center of an impeachment investigation.\n\n\u201cAs much as I think I would be a great fighter for the people of New Hampshire, and one U.S. senator can make a difference, it is my priority to make sure the president of the United States is reelected,\u201d Lewandowski said on the radio show, \u201cNew Hampshire Today with Jack Heath.\u201d\n\nLewandowski had pushed back against rumors last week that he\u2019d been tapped to run an impeachment war room at the White House, but said he\u2019d do whatever the president needed.\n\n11:20 a.m.: Sen. Grassley says whistleblower deserves \u2018to be heard out and protected,\u2019 but condemns \u2018uninformed speculation\u2019\n\nSen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), who chairs and co-founded the Senate Whistleblower Protection caucus, released a statement defending the whistleblower\u2019s actions, but reserved judgment about the facts of the intelligence official\u2019s complaint.\n\n\u201cThis person appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cWe should always work to respect whistleblowers\u2019 requests for confidentiality.\u201d\n\nBut Grassley also said no one should pass judgment before hearing directly from the whistleblower. \u201cUninformed speculation wielded by politicians or media commentators as a partisan weapon is counterproductive and doesn\u2019t serve the country,\u201d the senator said.\n\nGrassley made sure to distinguish, however, his support for hearing out the whistleblower with the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry, saying that \u201cinquiries that put impeachment first and facts last don\u2019t weigh very credibly.\u201d\n\n11 a.m.: Trump takes fresh aim at Schiff, says he should be \u2018brought up on charges\u2019\n\nTrump returned to Twitter late Tuesday morning to take fresh aim at Schiff, suggesting that the House Intelligence Committee chairman should be \u201cbrought up on charges\u201d for a statement he made during a hearing last week.\n\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t Congressman Adam Schiff being brought up on charges for fraudulently making up a statement and reading it to Congress as if this statement, which was very dishonest and bad for me, was directly made by the President of the United States?\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThis should never be allowed!\u201d\n\nIn his statement, Schiff offered an embellished re-creation of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky. Schiff later said that it was meant as parody, which he said should have been obvious to Trump.\n\n10:30 a.m.: Pompeo says State Dept. officials won\u2019t show up for scheduled impeachment depositions this week\n\nThe secretary of state fired a broadside at House Democrats on Tuesday, saying State Department officials scheduled to appear this week before committees conducting the impeachment inquiry would not be made available until \u201cwe obtain further clarity on these matters.\u201d\n\nThe refusal, in a letter to Engel, described the demand for depositions by five officials who played a role in U.S. relations with Ukraine as \u201can attempt to intimidate, bully, and treat improperly, the distinguished professionals of the Department of State.\u201d\n\nThe statements came as Pompeo\u2019s role in the Ukraine investigation broadened with reports that he was a participant in the July 25 call by Trump to the Ukrainian president.\n\nBefore that report, first published by The Wall Street Journal, Pompeo had brushed off questions about the incident, saying last week that he had not yet read the transcript of the telephone call released by the White House, or the whistleblower complaint that it sparked.\n\nThe committee, along with the House Intelligence and Oversight panels, had requested the five officials to appear for depositions this week and next, to begin Wednesday with Marie Yovanovitch, who was recalled by Pompeo as ambassador to Ukraine in May, before the end of her tour.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Karen DeYoung\n\n10:25 a.m.: Trump\u2019s tweeted electoral map included several errors\n\nA 2016 electoral map tweeted by Trump on Tuesday morning included several errors, depicting some counties that Democrat Hillary Clinton carried as counties that he won.\n\nThe map was intended to show the breadth of Trump\u2019s support as Democrats move toward impeachment.\n\nRead more from an analysis by The Post\u2019s Philip Bump here.\n\n9:20 a.m.: Trump calls for learning \u2018everything about\u2019 the whistleblower\n\nTrump on Tuesday questioned why he is not \u201centitled to interview & learn everything about\u201d a whistleblower who filed a complaint against him and whose identity is protected by federal statute.\n\n\u201cSo if the so-called \u2018Whistleblower\u2019 has all second hand information, and almost everything he has said about my \u2018perfect\u2019 call with the Ukrainian President is wrong (much to the embarrassment of Pelosi & Schiff), why aren\u2019t we entitled to interview & learn everything about the Whistleblower, and also the person who gave all of the false information to him,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThis is simply about a phone conversation that could not have been nicer, warmer, or better.\u201d\n\nAndrew P. Bakaj, a lawyer representing the whistleblower, sent a letter on Saturday to acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire expressing fears for his client\u2019s safety.\n\nIn the letter, Bakaj cited Trump\u2019s remarks last week in which he said whoever gave the whistleblower the information about the call was \u201cclose to a spy\u201d and alluded to the death penalty. Bakaj also said that \u201ccertain individuals\u201d have issued a $50,000 \u201cbounty\u201d for \u201cany information\u201d relating to his client\u2019s identity.\n\nTrump\u2019s contention that the whistleblower has only secondhand information is at odds with a statement released by Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson.\n\n9 a.m.: Hillary Clinton calls Trump\u2019s efforts to out the whistleblower \u2018really dangerous\u2019\n\nHillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee defeated by Trump in 2016, warned Tuesday that his efforts to unmask the whistleblower are \u201creally dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom everything we know, and we don\u2019t know much, this is an experienced person who saw things that bothered him,\u201d Clinton said during an appearance on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what the whole whistleblower statute is for, and it\u2019s to protect their identity.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Trump told reporters that he was trying to \u201cfind out about\u201d the anonymous U.S. intelligence official who filed the complaint. In tweets Sunday night, Trump said he wants to meet his \u201caccuser\u201d and warned of \u201cBig Consequences.\u201d\n\nDuring her ABC appearance, Clinton said she is confident Democrats will not overplay their hand in the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cI think the evidence concerning Ukraine is so dramatic and irrefutable, because it came right out of the White House,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that they will do a thoughtful, thorough job. Nobody should jump to any conclusions.\u201d\n\nClinton is on a tour to promote \u201cThe Book of Gutsy Women,\u201d which she wrote with her daughter, Chelsea.\n\n8:35 a.m.: Giuliani seeks to put focus on Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings\n\nGiuliani sought Monday to focus attention on the former vice president and his son, Hunter Biden, complaining that the media has not adequately covered the latter\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine and China.\n\n\u201cHow corrupted is most of our media if they can\u2019t figure out that Ukraine and China was paying for Biden\u2019s office, not his struggling son\u2019s nonexistent expertise,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cEvery time we lecture them on corruption, they laugh and say you\u2019re no different.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine\u2019s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.\n\nHunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Joe Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.\n\nHunter Biden also traveled with his father on Air Force Two to China during his tenure as vice president.\n\nTwelve days later, Hunter Biden joined the board of a just-formed investment advisory firm, known as BHR, whose partners included Chinese entities.\n\n7:15 a.m.: Trump: \u2018Try to impeach this\u2019\n\nTrump pinned to the top of his Twitter feed a largely red 2016 election map with the words \u201cTry to impeach this\u201d emblazoned across it.\n\nThe map appears to depict counties Trump won in red and those carried by Democrat Hillary Clinton in blue. Because Clinton, for the most part, won more densely populated parts of the country, many of them on the coasts, the map appears largely red even though Clinton received nearly 3 million more votes than Trump, who prevailed in the electoral college.\n\n7:10 a.m.: Trump once again claims his call was \u2018PERFECT\u2019\n\nTrump on Tuesday resurrected familiar defenses of his call with Zelensky, calling it \u201cPERFECT\u201d in one of a spate of tweets on the controversy and claiming he is the target of a \u201cHOAX!\u201d\n\nTrump also took fresh aim at Schiff, whom Trump suggested on Monday should be arrested for treason.\n\n\u201cThe congratulatory phone call with the Ukrainian President was PERFECT, unless you heard Liddle\u2019 Adam Schiff\u2019s fraudulently made up version of the call,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThis is just another Fake News Media, together with their partner, the Democrat Party, HOAX!\u201d\n\nIn a statement at a hearing last week, Schiff offered an embellished recreation of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky. Schiff later said that it was meant as parody, which he said should have been obvious to Trump.\n\nDuring morning tweets, Trump also shared television clips of several allies defending him, including House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.).\n\nIn a tweet that included a clip of his appearance Monday night on Fox News, Scalise wrote: \u201cRadicals & socialists have taken over the Democrat Party. They\u2019re calling all the shots now. Just last week, they pressured Pelosi into launching a baseless impeachment inquiry based on false rumors & left-wing rage. This is a witch hunt of @realDonaldTrump, plain & simple.\u201d\n\nDuring his Tuesday morning tweets, Trump also touched on a few other topics, including a viral video of an airport cart spinning wildly on the tarmac at Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International. In another tweet, he congratulated China on 70 years of Communist rule.\n\n6:30 a.m.: Kamala Harris calls on Twitter to suspend Trump\u2019s account\n\nSen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) on Monday night called for Twitter to suspend Trump\u2019s account as he continued his attacks on the whistleblower and told reporters he was trying to \u201cfind out about\u201d the anonymous U.S. intelligence official who filed the complaint.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s tweets and his behavior about this are just further evidence of the fact that he uses his power in a way that is designed to beat people down instead of lift people up,\u201d Harris, a 2020 Democratic White House hopeful, said during a CNN appearance. \u201cIf you look at what he\u2019s been tweeting today directed at the whistleblower, I frankly think that based on this and all we\u2019ve seen before, including attacking members of Congress, that his Twitter account should be suspended.\u201d\n\nIn his tweets Monday, Trump called the complaint lodged by a whistleblower \u201ca fraud.\u201d In tweets Sunday night, Trump said he wants to meet his \u201caccuser\u201d and warned of \u201cBig Consequences.\u201d\n\n6 a.m.: Inspector general pushes back on claims that whistleblower relied solely on hearsay\n\nAtkinson, the intelligence community inspector general, pushed back Monday on repeated claims by Trump and Republican allies that the whistleblower lacked firsthand knowledge of events and based his claim only on \u201chearsay.\u201d\n\nIn a lengthy statement, Atkinson, a Trump appointee, said it was not true that he found the whistleblower could \u201cprovide nothing more than secondhand or unsubstantiated assertions.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough the Complainant\u2019s Letter acknowledged that the Complainant was not a direct witness to the President\u2019s July 25, 2019, telephone call with the Ukrainian President, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community determined that other information obtained during the ICIG\u2019s preliminary review supported the Complainant\u2019s allegations,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAmid tweets on Monday, Trump promoted the false narrative that has been spread by Republicans in recent days that the intelligence community recently eliminated a requirement that whistleblowers provide direct, firsthand knowledge of alleged wrongdoings. The statute has never required that standard \u2014 a point Atkinson also made in his statement.\n\njohn.wagner@washpost.com\n\ncolby.itkowitz@washpost.com\n\nfelicia.sonmez@washpost.com", "description": "The president and his Republican allies continued to push back against a rapidly moving impeachment inquiry.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAI9pJe.img?h=200&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=1970&y=2468"}
