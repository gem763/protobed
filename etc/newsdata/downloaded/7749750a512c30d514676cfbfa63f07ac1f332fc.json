But the source confirmed that the publication of the valuation, which was more than \u00a3800 million pounds ($1.45 billion), was a significant hint from the Barclays.\n\nThe directors said in the accounts that the valuation reflected the hotel's freehold tenure, its prime location on the busy Piccadilly thoroughfare near Buckingham Palace, the quality of the building, the casino lease and the brand name.\n\nTurnover stood at \u00a347 million in 2018, while the operating profit was \u00a315 million, according to the accounts.\n\nIndependent real estate expert Paul Olliff, said the high valuation, which relied more on the hotel's prestige than on its financial performance, could be a hurdle to a deal.\n\n\"However, given it will be classed as a 'trophy asset', buyers might not be put off by a financial performance that doesn't reflect the sale price,\" said Mr Olliff, who is a legal director at law firm Ashfords' real estate team.\n\n\"Whether it's an inflated price or not, this should not be seen as an indication of the buoyant hotel market in the UK in a wider context, primarily because the Ritz is almost a 'one-off.'\"\n\nHe said the hotel would attract significant attention worldwide, with a pool of 10 or so ultra-high net worth individuals likely to consider a bid.\n\nThe London Ritz is not connected to its Paris namesake. Both were founded by the same man, but are now under entirely separate ownership. The Paris Ritz was where Princess Diana dined just before her fatal car crash in 1997.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo years after her death, her widower Prince Charles made his first public appearance with his new partner, Camilla Parker Bowles, at a party at the London Ritz. The couple later married.\n\nThe potential sale of the London hotel was first reported by the Times newspaper.\n\nA representative of the Barclay brothers declined to comment.\n\nReuters", "description": "The businessman twins who own London's Ritz have received several unsolicited offers and have indicated they would be open to selling the grand luxury hotel.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9098%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_545/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0470338ccd0f0266376024e5ab71e93069cbb987", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
