He struck with three poacher\u2019s finishes for England against Austria on Tuesday night and was denied a fourth when his late penalty was saved.\n\nThe on-loan Arsenal striker has scored 10 goals in 13 appearances for club and country this season and is averaging a goal every 63 minutes of action, but has been frustrated by his lack of opportunities under Bielsa so far.\n\n\u201cIt has been disappointing for me not to start in the league,\u201d said Nketiah. \u201cI went there to play games and get games. It is still early times. I think every time I have come on I have done well and shown why I think I should be playing.\n\n\u201cI think [the hat-trick against Austria] was a good statement and a good way for me to put across a performance. Hopefully I will be starting in the next run of games.\u201d", "description": "Eddie Nketiah hopes that his hat-trick for England under-21s will convince Marcelo Bielsa to give him more minutes at Leeds United after a frustrating start to his loan spell at Elland Road.", "authors": ["Sam Dean", "Paul Hayward"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/16/TELEMMGLPICT000213146824-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqPSGJeyftEP9WNF5nKPELKXC0R_SaMHCRKHFaU83wiy8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
