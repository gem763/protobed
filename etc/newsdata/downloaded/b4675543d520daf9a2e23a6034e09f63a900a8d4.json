An artificial lake, part of the Il\u0131su hydroelectric dam project, will swallow it up. The huge dam, Turkey\u2019s second largest, is being filled further down the Tigris River, despite protests that it will displace thousands of people and risks creating water shortages downstream, namely in Iraq. Residents are being moved from the ancient town to New Hasankeyf nearby, while historic artefacts have also been transported out of the area", "description": "An artificial lake will swallow up the Turkish town as a huge dam is filled further down the Tigris River", "authors": ["B\u00fclent K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ea47170ce59e201d0907f84ba68c083b5c2d4c6/0_80_6048_3628/master/6048.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7ead1530c2e01cc8cc37f341625852d8", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
