Central People\u2019s Government, had proposed the full withdrawal of the bill as a way to ease tensions. The report said the central government rejected the idea and ordered Ms Lam not to give in to any other protest demands. It is highly unlikely that she would attempt to withdraw the bill without Beijing\u2019s consent.\n\nIt comes after the release of a leaked audio recording showed Ms Lam telling business leaders she took responsibility for unleashing \u201cunforgivable havoc\u201d on the city with the hugely unpopular bill. At the time it was introduced, Ms Lam argued that the extradition bill would prevent criminals from all over the world using Hong Kong as a safe haven.\n\nIn the recording, Ms Lam could be heard saying that she would have liked to \u201cquit\u201d as leader if she could. At a news conference on Tuesday, she said she had never tendered her resignation to Beijing and that she saw quitting as \u201cthe easier path\u201d. \u201dNot resigning was my own choice\u2026 I have not given myself the choice to take an easier path and that is to leave,\u201d she said.\n\nMeanwhile, the unrest showed no sign of easing on Tuesday night, with riot police and protesters again clashing in an MTR station and outside the Mong Kok police station.\n\nPolice fired beanbag guns and used pepper spray to try and get demonstrators to disperse, and TV footage showed one man being removed from the scene on a stretcher after he was apprehended by the police.\n\nActivists shared the footage, and earlier clips showing his detention, as evidence of police brutality. Protest leaders have called for an independent investigation into police tactics during the current crisis as another of their key demands.\n\nThe police, who have repeatedly denied using excessive force, did not immediately respond to a request for comment following Tuesday night\u2019s incident.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive is to announce the formal withdrawal of a controversial extradition bill that sparked weeks of unrest, finally meeting a key demand of the protest movement.
