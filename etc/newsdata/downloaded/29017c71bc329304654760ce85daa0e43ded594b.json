She had met pro-Beijing politicians earlier on Wednesday to inform them of her decision.\n\nThe news prompted a surge in Hong Kong stocks. As well as the commitment to withdraw the bill the next time the city\u2019s legislative council meets, Ms Lam also promised to start meeting citizens and protest leaders so that they could \u201cair their grievances\u201d. The government had previously said it would only engage in dialogue once the situation had \u201ccalmed down\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

But this was not enough to placate protesters, who made the complete withdrawal of the bill a key tenet of their so-called five demands. Other demands include an amnesty from prosecution for protesters, and the right to universal suffrage in the election of Hong Kong\u2019s leader.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Hong Kong international airport on August 14 AP\n\nWednesday\u2019s announcement was \u201ctoo little too late\u201d, said the activist Joshua Wong, a leader in the 2014 Umbrella Movement who has also emerged as a key figure in the current crisis.\n\n\u201cThe intensified police brutality in the previous weeks has left an irreversible scar on the entire Hong Kong society,\u201d he said, demanding the government listen to \u201call five demands\u201d including an independent investigation into police conduct.\n\nAuthorities have employed water cannons, tear gas, rubber bullets and batons against demonstrators, with more than 1,100 people having been detained across the months of protests.\n\nIn the televised statement, Ms Lam said the government could not accept the other demands. Nonetheless, she named two new members to join an official police watchdog that has been tasked with investigating the matter.\n\nIt is unclear why Beijing has decided now to give in to at least one of the protesters\u2019 demands. It is inconceivable that Ms Lam would attempt to withdraw the bill without the consent of the Central People\u2019s Government, and she has admitted this week that she has little room for manoeuvre in appeasing both the central government and the people of Hong Kong.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

At the time it was introduced, Ms Lam argued that the extradition bill would prevent criminals from all over the world using Hong Kong as a safe haven.\n\nIn the recording, Ms Lam could be heard saying that she would have liked to \u201cquit\u201d as leader if she could. At a news conference on Tuesday, she said she had never tendered her resignation to Beijing. \u201dNot resigning was my own choice \u2026 I have not given myself the choice to take an easier path and that is to leave,\u201d she said.\n\nMeanwhile, the unrest showed no sign of easing on Tuesday night, with riot police and protesters again clashing in a metro station and outside the Mong Kok police station.\n\nAnd the unrest in Hong Kong showed no sign of ending today. Politician Michael Tien said the withdrawal of the bill would not stop people taking to the streets if it is not accompanied by other concessions.\n\n\u201cIt is too little, too late. The focus now has completely shifted. Most people do not remember what the bill is about but are more concerned about the escalating violence and alleged police heavy-handedness against protesters,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said Ms Lam had rejected his call for an independent inquiry, which would have the power to summon witnesses, on the ground that it would overlap with the police watchdog probe.\n\nPro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo said the protesters are adamant that all their demands, including calls for direct elections, are fulfilled. She mocked Ms Lam\u2019s bid to seek dialogue to address public grievances.\n\n\u201cShe has been fast asleep these three months, this is just absurd,\u201d Ms Mo said. \u201cThe scars and wounds are still bleeding, and she thinks she can just use some garden hose to put out the hill fire. That is not acceptable.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive has announced the formal withdrawal of a controversial extradition bill that sparked weeks of unrest, finally meeting a key demand of the protest movement.
