(Image: All images NBC)\n\nThe Good Place may be about four previously unpleasant people trying to avoid eternal damnation in the pits of hell, but it\u2019s also chock full of sweetness \u2014 that every-flavour frozen yogurt deliciousness that shows just how forking awesome our deceased (and demonic) protagonists actually are.\n\nAs Eleanor (Kristen Bell), Michael (Ted Danson), Chidi (William Jackson Harper), Tahani (Jameela Jamil), Jason (Manny Jacinto) and Janet (D\u2019Arcy Carden) get ready for their final run through the afterlife in season four, we\u2019re taking a look at the moments that reminded us about the true philosophy of The Good Place: It\u2019s not about being good, it\u2019s about trying to find the goodness.\n\nThey\u2019ve tried so many times, it was hard to narrow it down. But narrow it down we did. Here\u2019s a breakdown of our sweetest moments and memories from The Good Place, in order from when they appeared. I hope you\u2019ve got a shirtful of tissues handy.\n\nEleanor Comforts Tahani\n\nSeason 1, Episode 3: \u201cTahani Al-Jamil\u201d\n\nIt would\u2019ve been very easy to turn Eleanor and Tahani into backstabbing frenemies. Heck, that\u2019s kind of what they were for a little while. But the series gave us early signs that the relationship between Eleanor and Tahani was way more complicated (and better written) than that.\n\nThe first sign was in episode three of the first season when Eleanor took a break from her Tahani jealousy session to comfort her new friend who was having a hard time getting along with her soulmate. The fact that Eleanor knew exactly how to comfort Tahani \u2014 by telling her she had a \u201crocking bod\u201d \u2014 not only showed Eleanor\u2019s starting growth but signalled the future of a loving female friendship built on sexy compliments and shared vulnerability.\n\nJason and Janet\u2019s Wedding\n\nSeason 1, Episode 10: \u201cChidi\u2019s Choice\u201d\n\nChidi wasn\u2019t the only one making a choice in this episode. Jason and not-a-robot Janet decided to get married in a surprise and last-minute ceremony. As Eleanor and Tahani (the only witnesses) laughed their way through the absurdity, Janet and Jason pledged their version of eternal love for each other.\n\nOf course, everything about it screamed Jason Mendoza, from how he ripped off his tuxedo\u2019s sleeves to giving a shout-out to his beloved Jaguars in his vows. It might have seemed like a weird fluke, something that would get written off as a joke later on, but it\u2019s actually become one of the most-beloved relationships on the series.\n\nEleanor Comforts Michael\n\nSeason 2, Episode 5: \u201cExistential Crisis\u201d\n\nYes, it\u2019s another moment of Eleanor comforting one of her friends. What can we say: She\u2019s really good at it! Michael spent much of season two learning to understand the human condition, experiencing an existential crisis after realising that life is meaningless and death is inevitable. At first, he reacted by channeling his pain into a \u201cmidlife\u201d crisis \u2014 complete with a Miami Vice suit, sports car, and having Janet act ditzy.\n\nBut then, Eleanor got real with him. She told him that he was experiencing what all humans do: a permanent, underlying sadness at the idea that everything we do may not matter in the end. But we do it anyway, even through the pain, because it\u2019s better to try than do nothing. It may be a harsh lesson, one we\u2019ve all had to learn, but Eleanor managed to deliver with the compassion and empathy it deserved.\n\n\u201cI Was So Scared For You!\u201d\n\nSeason 2, Episode 9: \u201cLeap To Faith\u201d\n\nWhen Michael held a demon-friendly roast for Eleanor, Chidi, Tahani, and Jason, it seemed like his time as a member of Team Cockroach had come to a terrible end. But it turns out he was giving them clues (over 1,200 to be precise) on how they could evade capture and delivery to the Bad Place.\n\nThe moment that Michael found them hiding on the train tracks, it seemed like he was about to unleash hell. But instead, he burst into tears, saying how worried he was about them because they\u2019re his friends and he didn\u2019t want anything bad happening to them. It was very un demon-like behaviour, but oh so Michael.\n\nAlso, want to give a shout-out to the gang sending Mindy a bunch of cocaine and Derek as a willing and enthusiastic sex partner. It may have turned into some strange kinky shirt, but it was also pretty darn sweet.\n\nThe Party\n\nSeason 2, Episode 10: \u201cBest Self\u201d\n\nWhat do you do when it\u2019s the end of the world and you\u2019ve got nowhere to go but down? Party with your best friends! Team Cockroach commemorated their last night before being sent to the Bad Place with picnics, dancing, and as much liquor as Janet could muster.\n\nEleanor\u2019s beautiful toast celebrated their journey and their accomplishments, and Michael was named an \u201chonorary human.\u201d Luckily, the episode ended with Tahani coming to the drunken realisation that they should \u201cspeak to a manager\u201d about the whole going-to-hell thing, leading Michael to formulate a plan to get them before the Judge.\n\nMichael\u2019s Trolley Solution\n\nSeason 2, Episode 11: \u201cRhonda, Diana, Jake, and Trent\u201d\n\nIn the season two finale of The Good Place, bartender Michael (paying tribute to Ted Danson\u2019s character from Cheers) asks Eleanor one simple question: \u201cWhat do we owe each other?\u201d It was a question that took Michael a whole season of personal exploration to uncover and was finally answered when Michael chose to sacrifice himself to get Eleanor in front of the Judge, by giving her his pin and pushing her in front of the portal.\n\nIt was a moment of selflessness for a character who\u2019d spent an eternity being rewarded for selfishness and cruelty. Whether it\u2019s honesty, empathy, or a willingness to do what it takes to make someone else\u2019s life a little bit better, Michael finally understood that we may not owe everything to each other...but at least we owe something.\n\nThe Daughter\u2019s Drawing\n\nSeason 3, Episode 5: \u201cJeremy Bearimy\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for our heroes to discover that Michael and Janet had messed with their lives and created a reality where they hadn\u2019t died, in an attempt to prove to the Judge that they could become good people.\n\nThis truth came to a harsh light in \u201cJeremy Bearimy,\u201d when Michael explained that now that they knew the truth of his latest experiment it was doomed to fail and they\u2019d all be sent to the Bad Place. Chidi responded appropriately by having a complete mental breakdown, while Tahani and Jason went out and gave away a bunch of money.\n\nEleanor\u2019s story was the most surprising. At first, she reacted how you\u2019d expect, she told the others to kiss her grits and went to a bar. But then, she found a stranger\u2019s wallet and decided to return it to him. That task turned into a downright endeavour, leading her to the man\u2019s front door holding a bunch of stuff from his old house.\n\nHe didn\u2019t care about the money she\u2019d consciously left inside; his greatest treasure was a drawing his daughter had made for him. It was his good-luck charm for his new job, and Eleanor had brought it back to him. It showed how much Eleanor had grown as a person \u2014 how, even when it seemed futile, she chose to do the right thing.\n\nPillboi\u2019s Refrain\n\nSeason 3, Episode 6 \u201cThe Ballad of Donkey Doug\u201d\n\nPart of season three was dedicated to Team Cockroach (a.k.a. the Soul Squad) trying to help the people in their lives once they\u2019d learned they were destined to go to the Bad Place.\n\nAll of the reunions had their moments, whether it was Tahani and her sister Kamillah finally hugging it out, to Eleanor honestly telling her mum that she shouldn\u2019t fuck it up with her new family as she did with her. But the one that felt the sweetest had to be between Jason and Pillboi. Yeah, that\u2019s right.\n\nJason found his way to Donkey Doug, his dance troupe rival who happened to also be his father (twist!). The reunion ended up being bittersweet, as not only did Jason realise he wasn\u2019t really meant to help him, but it was clear that Donkey Doug didn\u2019t really want to be a father figure. Instead, Jason turned his attention to Pillboi, his old crime buddy who\u2019d started working at a retirement home.\n\nIt was clear that Pillboi, despite his complaints, really did love what he was doing and Jason was happy to support him. Of course, their final goodbye was hilarious (with the best handshake/dab/trust fall exercise of all time), but it was also really emotional. In its own, Jaguars Rule way.\n\nChidi Comforts Eleanor\n\nSeason 3, Episode 9: \u201cJanet(s)\u201d\n\nEleanor may be the one who gives the most comforting, marshmallow speeches, but sometimes it\u2019s necessary for someone else to take a turn. Janet-Eleanor spent the episode trying to understand why Janet-Chidi was so reluctant to accept the fact that they\u2019d fallen in love in their previous reboots, with Janet-Chidi saying it wasn\u2019t actually \u201chim\u201d because he didn\u2019t remember it happening.\n\nBut it\u2019s actually because he was afraid of what he truly felt, something that inevitably came out as Eleanor literally started losing her identity. It was at that moment the two of them finally accepted their role in each other\u2019s lives \u2014 a beautiful and inspiring moment that eventually turned heartbreaking.\n\nEleanor and Chidi\u2019s Goodbye\n\nSeason 3, Episode 13: \u201cPandemonium\u201d\n\nSometimes, the sweetest moments are the ones that make you forking lose it. That\u2019s me every time I watch Eleanor and Chidi saying goodbye at the end of season three. Buckets of tears. It\u2019s the final experiment for the Good Place, a chance to see if the standards for acceptance are too harsh and need to be changed. But it comes at a price \u2014 no thanks to the Bad Place\u2019s schemes.\n\nThe last season ended with Chidi coming into \u201carchitect\u201d Eleanor\u2019s fake Good Place stripped of his afterlife memories, because his ex-girlfriend Simone had just arrived and he knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to keep it together. So, Eleanor and Chidi spent the season finale trying to figure out how to say goodbye, seeing their lives played out in a movie from Michael that showed their blossoming love over centuries.\n\nEven though Chidi now doesn\u2019t remember their time together, I have a feeling nothing can stop the sweetest people in any place. It\u2019s Jeremy Bearimy, baby, they\u2019ll live in the dot of the \u201ci\u201d forever.\n\nThe Good Place returns with its fourth and final season on September 27 in the U.S. but it has no confirmed Australian release as of yet.
