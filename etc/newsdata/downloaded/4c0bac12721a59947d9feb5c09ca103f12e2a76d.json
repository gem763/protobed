That would mean the company wants to reduce its workforce by up to 16 percent through the cuts.\n\nHP said it expects to incur an overall cost of about $1bn to restructure.\n\n\"We are taking bold and decisive actions as we embark on our next chapter,\" said Enrique Lores, the company's incoming chief executive officer and longtime executive.\n\n\"We see significant opportunities to create shareholder value and we will accomplish this by advancing our leadership, disrupting industries and aggressively transforming the way we work.\"\n\nLores will take over the CEO position on November 1 from Dion Weisler who is stepping down due to family and health reasons.\n\nThe HP headquarters in Palo Alto, California also said its board on September 30 approved an additional $5bn in share buybacks. Its share price has fallen by about 10 percent so far this year up to Thursday's market close, before the announcement.\n\nHP's has been financially hit by falling sales in its printing business, a major source of profit which was recently dubbed a \u201cmelting ice cube\u201d by analysts at Sanford C Bernstein.\n\nThe company said it would make changes to its printing unit to focus on providing more services, including raising prices for printers that can be used with non-HP ink cartridges.\n\nHP expects to generate cash of at least $3bn in its 2020 fiscal year and return at least 75 percent to its shareholders, done through a 10 percent increase in its quarterly dividend as well as share buybacks.\n\nThe company also announced it expects profit excluding restructuring costs and other items, to be $2.22 to $2.32 a share in fiscal 2020. Analysts, on average, estimated $2.23 a share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.", "description": "HP estimates that it can save $1bn by the end of its 2022 fiscal year, but the restructuring will also cost it $1bn.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/4/40fe5e1ca70c456dafada94d7c9b277f_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
