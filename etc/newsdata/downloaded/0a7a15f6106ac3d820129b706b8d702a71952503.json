But it also laid bare the growing tensions between a burgeoning activist movement and global leaders, many of whom acknowledge the seriousness of climate change but have yet to commit to the kind of transformational changes that scientists say are needed to avert its worst effects in coming decades.\n\n\u201cYou are failing us,\u201d teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg told heads of state as she spoke onstage, her face flushed with anger. \u201cThe eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us, I say, we will never forgive you.\u201d\n\nU.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres had insisted that countries show up to the much-anticipated \u201cclimate action summit\u201d not with lofty rhetoric but with concrete promises, such as vowing to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, cut fossil fuel subsidies and cease construction of coal-fired power plants.\n\n\u201cDear friends, there is a cost to everything. But the biggest cost is doing nothing,\u201d Guterres told the gathering Monday morning. \u201cThe biggest cost is subsidizing a dying fossil fuel industry, building more and more coal power plants, and denying what is plain as day: that we are in a deep climate hole, and to get out, we must first stop digging.\u201d\n\nPromises flowed one after another throughout the day, in three-minute speech after three-minute speech, as leaders from France, Germany, India and other countries detailed plans to increase their use of renewable energy and curb fossil fuel burning linked to climate change. Overall, at least 65 countries have indicated that they intend to strengthen the commitments they made under the 2015 Paris agreement by the end of next year.\n\n\u201cWe cannot let our youth spend every Friday demonstrating for the climate and simply answer, \u2018Everything is fine, we are doing everything right,\u2019 \u201d said French President Emmanuel Macron. \u201cWe are still far from the account.\u201d\n\nAs the day wore on, there was a growing sense that Monday\u2019s summit would not by itself offer the jolt organizers had once hoped. Businesses and private investors announced ambitious climate plans; almost 300 multinational corporations with $5.5 trillion in revenue pledged to continue to expand renewable energy and electric transportation around the world. Numerous small nations already feeling the effects of climate change vowed their own aggressive targets. But the world\u2019s largest emitters once again stopped short of committing to the sort of far-reaching new goals scientists say are needed to rein in emissions.\n\nOn Monday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi committed his nation to more than doubling its renewable energy capacity by 2030, though the growing country still relies heavily on coal-fired power generation. German Chancellor Angela Merkel detailed a recently passed package of measures to invest billions in electric vehicles, ramp up renewable energy and phase out coal, though green groups have called the efforts too modest.\n\n\u201cMost of the major economies fell woefully short. Their lack of ambition stands in sharp contrast with the growing demand for action around the world,\u201d Andrew Steer, head of the World Resources Institute, said in a statement. \u201cWe need far greater national leadership on climate action \u2014 and we need it now.\u201d\n\nIt remains unclear whether the world can ultimately muster the collective political will to make the kind of shift away from fossil fuels in transportation, energy and agriculture that scientists say is necessary to limit global warming. The planet has already warmed 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels.\n\nIn Paris in late 2015, leaders from 195 nations banded together in an unprecedented agreement to collectively cut carbon emissions and hold the world\u2019s warming to \u201cwell below\u201d 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F). Four years later, the euphoria of that moment has faded into a sober realism about the scale of the challenge and the obstacles that exist.\n\nGlobal carbon emissions hit a record in 2018. Many countries are failing to live up to the pledges they made in Paris \u2014 promises that leaders acknowledge were not ambitious enough to begin with \u2014 even as leaders have been asked to devise more ambitious plans by the end of 2020. Scientists have continued to issue ever more dire warnings about melting permafrost, retreating glaciers, rising seas, more extreme weather, and the impacts such changes are having on societies.\n\nIn addition, the United States under President Trump has retreated from its role as a global leader on climate action. On Monday, Trump swept through the halls of the United Nations on his way to a meeting, as Thunberg looked on sternly, but he played no role in the proceedings.\n\nAsked later in the day why he swung by the climate summit, Trump replied, \u201cBecause I believe in clean air and clean water, very simple. We have the cleanest air, we have the cleanest water.\u201d\n\nThe Climate Action Tracker, a consortium of scientists that compares global climate pledges and policies to future temperature projections, issued an analysis last week that found if current policies remain in place, the world will warm at least 1.5 degrees Celsius by around 2035, 2 degrees by around 2053, and 3.2 degrees by the end of the century. Even if national governments achieve the emissions cuts they have committed to, it noted, the average global temperature is likely to rise nearly 3 degrees Celsius by 2100.\n\nNiklas H\u00f6hne, a German climatologist and founding partner of NewClimate Institute, which created the Climate Action Tracker, said in an interview that the announcements made Monday are unlikely to change the long-term projections for global temperature rise because many of those nations are not large carbon emitters.\n\n\u201cIt has to be a large player, with a large amount of emissions, to change the temperature,\u201d he said.\n\nH\u00f6hne added that while the actions of many individual states and cities, as well as U.S. companies, have kept overall U.S. carbon emissions from changing course significantly under Trump, the administration\u2019s promotion of natural gas exports to countries such as India could ultimately lead to higher emissions overseas. During Modi\u2019s recent visit to Houston, India\u2019s state-owned Petronet LNG announced that it would invest in Tellurian Inc.\u2019s liquefied natural gas project on the Gulf Coast.\n\n\u201cWe need less fossil fuel infrastructure, not more,\u201d H\u00f6hne said.\n\nSome smaller, low-lying countries that are already wrestling with the impacts of climate change took the opportunity Monday to chide the world\u2019s largest economies for not doing more to address climate change.\n\n\u201cMy appeal is that powerful countries must chip in and take this seriously,\u201d said Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, as he said his nation would try to plant 10 billion trees over the next five years.\n\nIn the private sector and elsewhere, high-profile figures announced this week they were taking steps to mobilize steeper cuts in carbon emissions.\n\nAt a conference hosted by the Climate Group, an international organization that promotes climate action, former secretary of state John F. Kerry announced a new initiative called \u201cWorld War Zero\u201d aimed at holding carbon polluters accountable. Kerry is hoping to enlist the help of Trump\u2019s former defense secretary Jim Mattis, who said in a phone interview, \u201cI\u2019m considering it. I\u2019ve not made the decision.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s much-anticipated summit comes amid growing pressure on world leaders to act more aggressively \u2014 and swiftly \u2014 to combat climate change.\n\nOn Friday, in one of the largest youth-led demonstrations ever, millions of people across more than 150 countries and every continent took to the streets to protests for climate action.\n\nAt the United Nations on Monday, Thunberg and 15 other young people filed a legal complaint with the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child, arguing that major countries have known about the risks of climate change for decades but have failed to take sufficient action.\n\n\u201cRight here, right now, is where we draw the line,\u201d Thunberg said. \u201cThe world is waking up, and change is coming whether you like it or not.\u201d\n\nAnd in Washington, D.C., protesters blocked 15 intersections downtown during the morning commute to draw attention to their cause. Police made 32 arrests after some chained themselves to sailboats, while another blocked the road with an 80-foot-long inflatable pipeline.\n\nGuterres reminded world leaders Monday that the world\u2019s current trajectory is unsustainable, and he reminded them of the very human stakes of failing to craft a more sustainable future.\n\n\u201cI will not be there, but my granddaughters will. And your grandchildren, too,\u201d he said. \u201cI refuse to be an accomplice in the destruction of their one and only home.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt is my obligation \u2014 our obligation \u2014 to do everything to stop the climate crisis before it stops us. Time is running out. But it is not too late.\u201d\n\nSteven Mufson, Trish Wilson and Seung Min Kim contributed to this report.", "description": "Days after millions of young people took to the streets around the world to protest for more aggressive action on climate change, dozens of world leaders arrived Monday at the United Nations facing a simple question: What\u2019s your plan?", "authors": ["Brady Dennis", "Reporter Focusing On Environmental Policy", "Public Health Issues", "Juliet Eilperin", "Reporter Covering Domestic Policy", "National Affairs", "September At Pm", "Brady Dennis Is A National Reporter For The Washington Post", "Focusing On The Environment", "Public Health Issues.
