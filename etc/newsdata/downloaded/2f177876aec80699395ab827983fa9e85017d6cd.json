(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)\n\nThe Investigations\n\nWHAT RECESS?: While the president golfed and tweeted, House Democrats continued to plough the ground for their now formal impeachment investigation into Donald Trump.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chair Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who has been tapped to spearhead the probe, told ABC News the whistleblower at the center of the impeachment inquiry came to an agreement with his committee to testify about the complaint \u201cvery soon.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday night, Trump tweeted that he deserved to \u201cmeet his accuser\u201d \u2014 what some legal experts say amounts to witness intimidation:\n\n\" \u2026 In addition, I want to meet not only my accuser, who presented SECOND & THIRD HAND INFORMATION, but also the person who illegally gave this information, which was largely incorrect, to the 'Whistleblower,'\" he also tweeted.\n\nOne of the whistleblower's lawyers, Mark Zaid, said the House and Senate \u201call agree protecting whistleblower's identity is paramount\u201d and that discussions about his client's appearance before Congress \u201ccontinue to occur \u2026 but no date/time has yet been set.\u201d\n\nON MESSAGE: As Democrats charged ahead, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi previewing her caucus's messaging on \"60 Minutes,\" Republicans continued to defend the president, twisting themselves into pretzels as they grasped for answers or clung to White House talking points.\n\nWhite House senior adviser Stephen Miller sparred with Fox News Sunday's Chris Wallace:\n\n\u201cMiller dodged several questions from host [Wallace] about allegations surrounding the president\u2019s actions, such as Trump\u2019s decision to use not the federal government but rather his personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, to obtain information on the Bidens\u2019 activities in Ukraine,\u201d per our colleagues Felicia Sonmez and Mike DeBonis.\n\n\u201cHe also declined to answer when asked by Wallace to outline how, in his view, the Bidens broke any laws. And he disputed the use of the word 'whistleblower' to describe the person who sounded the alarm about Trump\u2019s actions, arguing that the complaint was a 'partisan hit job' by a 'deep-state operative' \u2026\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) was called out by \"60 Minutes's\" Scott Pelley for repeating talking points distributed by the White House to Congress after McCarthy continued to insist that Trump had nothing to defend.\n\n\u201cMr. Leader, with great respect to you, and I apologize for interrupting, but these are the White House talking points that were emailed to the Congress earlier this week,\u201d Pelley chastised McCarthy.\n\n\"The president's daughter right now is having all sorts of copyrights granted in foreign countries; that doesn't alarm you. The president's sons are doing all sorts of business all over the world; that doesn't alarm you.

It sticks in his mind when he hears it over and over again and for clarity here, George, let me just again repeat that it has no validity.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a bad day and a bad week for this president and for this country if he is asking for political dirt on an opponent,\u201d Bossert added.\n\n\u201cOther former aides to Mr. Trump said Sunday that he refused to accept reassurances about Ukraine no matter how many times it was explained to him, instead subscribing to an unsubstantiated narrative that has now brought him to the brink of impeachment,\u201d the New York Times's Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Maggie Haberman and Peter Baker report.\n\nKeyboard courage: Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) issued a rare rebuke of Trump on Sunday night after the president tweeted a quote that his impeachment would \u201ccause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.\u201d\n\nI have visited nations ravaged by civil war. @realDonaldTrump I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President. This is beyond repugnant. https://t.co/a5Bae7bP7g \u2014 Adam Kinzinger (@RepKinzinger) September 30, 2019\n\nCOUNTER-PROGRAMMING: As the whistleblower's complaint made it's way around Washington, the State Department accelerated its investigation into another one of Trump's (former) political adversaries \u2014 Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201c The Trump administration is investigating the email records of dozens of current and former senior State Department officials who sent messages to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email, reviving a politically toxic matter that overshadowed the 2016 election, current and former officials said,\u201d our colleagues Greg Miller, Greg Jaffe and Karoun Demirjian scooped over the weekend.\n\nThe Trump administration is investigating the email records of dozens of current and former senior State Department officials who sent messages to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email, reviving a politically toxic matter that overshadowed the 2016 election, current and former officials said,\u201d our colleagues Greg Miller, Greg Jaffe and Karoun Demirjian scooped over the weekend. \u201cState Department officials vigorously denied there was any political motivation behind their actions, and said that the reviews of retroactively classified emails were conducted by career bureaucrats who did not know the names of the subjects being investigated.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Addressing the impeachment inquiry against Pres.

Not a regular subscriber?\n\nThe Campaign\n\nTEAM BIDEN: Meanwhile, Joe Biden's supporters are concerned that his team isn't equipped to handle the onslaught of attacks, our colleague Matt Viser reports.\n\n\u201cSeveral allies, including top financial backers, are weighing whether to create a super PAC to independently defend Biden and go after the president, who has repeatedly accused the former vice president of corruption and whose campaign last week launched a $10 million ad blitz aimed largely at attacking Biden,\u201d per Viser.\n\n\u201cI do think things have changed \u2026 You have to recalibrate based on the fact that Trump\u2019s attacks on you are going to be at the center of these impeachment hearings,\u201d said Larry Rasky, a longtime ally of Biden\u2019s told Viser. \u201cRasky said he worries Biden\u2019s campaign has been naive about the amount of resources needed to counter Trump.\u201d\n\nThe Biden campaign, meanwhile, asked news channels on Sunday to stop booking the ubiquitous Rudy Giuliani on their shows, The Daily Beast's Maxwell Tani and Sam Stein report.\n\n\u201cIn a letter addressed to the heads of the major news and cable networks, as well as top news anchors, two top Biden campaign advisers make the case that by peddling routine falsehoods about the work of Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine, Giuliani\u2019s presence on the airwaves is editorially untenable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are writing today with grave concern that you continue to book Rudolph W. Giuliani on your air to spread false, debunked conspiracy theories on behalf of Donald Trump. While you often fact check his statements in real time during your discussions, that is no longer enough. By giving him your airtime, you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation,\u201d per the letter from top aides Anita Dunn and Kate Bedingfield.\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman stands between President Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan, in June. (Kim Kyung-Hoon/Kim Kyung-Hoon/Pool via Bloomberg)\n\nGlobal Power\n\nHOW TRUMP HELPED BRING THE SAUDI CROWN PRINCE BACK TO THE WORLD STAGE: This Wednesday marks one year since Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered, a savage killing the CIA, U.S. allies and a United Nations investigator say was ordered by the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman. Our colleagues Shane Harris and John Hudson reported on how Mohammed, with Trump's help, has begun to be welcomed back to the world stage and why one year later we're still waiting for justice.\n\nTrump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo never distanced themselves from Mohammed: \u201cFor Trump, the value of that relationship boiled down to dollars. He has never sugarcoated the grisly nature of the slain columnist\u2019s death,\u201d our colleagues write. \u201cBut he has repeatedly described the Middle East as a 'vicious' place, excusing Khashoggi\u2019s death as an unfortunate event not worth the cost of abandoning a lucrative market.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Trump, the value of that relationship boiled down to dollars.

Agnes Callamard, a human rights expert at the United Nations, obtained a list from government sources,\u201d our colleagues write. The list includes some individuals who have been accused of helping kill Khashoggi, such as an autopsy specialist who is accused of dismembering his body, but a former top aide to Mohammed who reportedly plotted the killing is not among them. The Saudi government has refused to answer any questions about his whereabouts.\n\nMBS speaks: He told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that he takes 'full responsibility' for Khashoggi's death because it was committed by Saudi government employees, our colleague Kareem Fahim reports. But he denied authorizing the killing.\n\nJamal Khashoggi seen here in 2014. (Hasan Jamali, File/AP)\n\nThe People\n\nREMEMBERING KHASHOGGI: The Post's Global Opinions staff put together a special section of 15 columns by Khashoggi\u2019s former colleagues, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J) and leading Saudi activists to explore his legacy, the lackluster response to his death from global powers and what lies ahead for the U.S.-Saudi relationship.\n\nHere are a few excerpts:\n\nFred Ryan's plea: \"Jamal\u2019s story cannot be forgotten. If it is, his murderers will succeed in evading justice. And Jamal Khashoggi will not be Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s last victim,\" Ryan, publisher and chief executive of The Post, writes in a column.\n\n\"Jamal\u2019s story cannot be forgotten. If it is, his murderers will succeed in evading justice. And Jamal Khashoggi will not be Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s last victim,\" Ryan, publisher and chief executive of The Post, writes in a column. Khashoggi\u2019s fiancee says it's never too late to respond: \"The fact that there are high-ranking individuals who wish to see some justice achieved in the future could alter the trajectory of this case. And there is still much that the president could do if he decides to stand up for our shared values,\" Hatice Cengiz writes. \"By pulling back the curtain on Jamal\u2019s murder, he could reaffirm to the world \u2014 and particularly to the Middle East \u2014 that the United States still believes that human rights and ethical values come first.\"\n\n\"The fact that there are high-ranking individuals who wish to see some justice achieved in the future could alter the trajectory of this case.

Today, more people than ever feel empowered to speak out \u2014 not only in spite of repressive leaders, but because of them,\" Rezaian, Khashoggi's former colleague who was imprisoned in Iran for 544 days, writes. \"Even in very dark times \u2014 as Jamal knew well \u2014 that\u2019s more than enough reason to sustain hope and keep pressing ahead.\"\n\n\"Authoritarians are having a moment, no doubt, but they are clearly nervous.
