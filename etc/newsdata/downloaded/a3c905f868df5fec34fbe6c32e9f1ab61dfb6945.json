But in America, even people who confess to crimes get a fair process. So he\u2019s going to get that.\u201d\n\nHe later added, \u201cWe will be fair, but if we, you know, go on a protracted investigation here, Donald Trump is just going to, you know, try and tie us up in court, give himself moral equivalence, and give everyone a nickname and confuse the American people. So, we want to move fairly but also swiftly.\u201d\n\n(h/t RCP Video)\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "Wednesday on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Rep.
