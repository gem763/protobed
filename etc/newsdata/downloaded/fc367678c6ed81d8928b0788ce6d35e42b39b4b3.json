They have gone as far as dropping their cases in fear of having to recount traumatic experiences, or being inadvertently outed to their friends, family or employers.\n\nTrips to police stations, as well as calls and visits from police officers to discuss their LGBT abuse experiences can be daunting if that person is not actually open about their LGBT status.\n\nThey say that all too often it is difficult to prove that an assault was motivated by hostility towards the victim's sexuality or gender identity, so attackers currently get off with lighter sentences.\n\nTwo of Britain's largest police forces - London's Metropolitan Police and Greater Manchester Police - have also seen an increase in the number of reported crimes.\n\nThe Met saw reports rise from 1,561 in 2014-2015 to 2,315 in 2018-19, while the number of cases that led to charges or summons fell from 246 to 165.\n\nGreater Manchester Police saw reports rise from 423 to 1,159, with the number of charges falling from 82 to 50.\n\nA Met Police spokesman said: \"Many of these non-violent offences present less evidential opportunities and victims often feel that there is a barrier between bringing the matter to court and prefer to make police aware of each offence.\"\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption Police said there was little evidence for many homophobic hate crimes and victims may choose not to bring a case to court\n\nA spokesman for the National Police Chiefs' Council said: \"Unfortunately, with many cases, there are often no witnesses to these crimes and scarce evidence - this may lead to police being unable to identify a suspect.\"\n\nThe Home Office said it was recruiting 20,000 additional police officers and investing a further \u00a385m in the Crown Prosecution Service over the next two years to \"ensure it can deal with the cases brought by the police\".\n\nBaroness Williams, minister for countering extremism, said: \"Victims should not have to put up with this venomous abuse and we will do all we can to support them.\n\n\"I would urge anyone who is affected by or has witnessed homophobic abuse to contact the police. Partners across the criminal justice system and government are working hard to empower victims to report incidents and ensure perpetrators are punished.\"", "description": "Some victims say they have reported hate crimes to the police but not seen anyone charged as a result.", "authors": ["Mick Tucker", "Dan Box", "Ben Hunte", "Bbc Radio Live Investigations"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14073/production/_108553028_gettyimages-1151760856.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
