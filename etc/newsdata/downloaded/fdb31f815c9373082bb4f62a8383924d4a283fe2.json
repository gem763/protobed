One Democratic aide said it included Trump hotel folders with alleged notes from interviews that took place at at the New York office of Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, about debunked conspiracies related to Ukraine.\n\nRaskin said its actual provenance is unknown, but the inspector general got the documents in May and sent them to the FBI. He said the lawmakers had been expecting to get briefed on other matters.\n\nRaskin, who was in the briefing, said there was nothing in the material that directly relates to Trump\u2019s conduct or that of Secretary of State Michael Pompeo.\u201cThe inspector general has no idea where it came from,\u201d Raskin said.\n\nWhite House to Preserve Phone Call Records (4:10 p.m.)\n\nJustice Department lawyers told a federal judge in Washington that the White House will preserve six categories of records related to Trump\u2019s telephone calls with foreign leaders.\n\nThat concession came Wednesday in a lawsuit filed by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington in May, demanding that Trump comply with the federal Presidential Records Act.\n\nThat potentially makes the records available if sought for the House impeachment inquiry as well.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump is moving forward as several House committees are to receive private briefings Wednesday from the State Department inspector general on documents related to Ukraine.Secretary of State Michael Pompeo has been subpoenaed to provide", "authors": ["Steven T.
