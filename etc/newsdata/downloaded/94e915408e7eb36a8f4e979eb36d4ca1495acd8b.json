Now, YouTube is emphasizing verifying prominent channels that have a \u201cclear need for proof of authenticity,\u201d according to the company. This includes traditional YouTubers, musicians, comedians, and artists, among others.\n\nCreators will be notified today if they\u2019re at risk of losing their badge\n\nVerification is an extremely important feature for creators. It affects which creators get top recommendations when people search for something on YouTube. Channels that no longer meet the criteria and may have their badge removed will be notified today, YouTube confirmed to The Verge. Creators will have the option to appeal the decision before the change takes place in late October.\n\nBeing verified also represents status for creators. Having the checkmark beside their channel name is a sign of being one of the most prominent members of the community. Losing that checkmark is going to leave creators feeling upset \u2014 especially at a time when many people have already voiced their concerns with YouTube\u2019s treatment of their community.\n\nThe criteria for verification due to prominence essentially looks at whether a creator or channel is recognizable enough both in and outside of YouTube that the company needs to authenticate them.\n\nThe company\u2019s authenticity rules are pretty simple: a channel has to be owned and operated by the person or company it claims to be in order to get a checkmark or other verification mark. For example, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s official channel would have an artist profile icon and a musical note beside her name to show people that the page belongs to the real Beyonc\u00e9 before, but that\u2019s changing to just a tonal grey background.\n\nThese new verification rules seem like another move from YouTube to more effectively moderate search results and recommendations, which is an area where the company has faced widespread criticism. Company executives have said they want to work on ensuring that the algorithm recommends authentic and authoritative videos from well-known and respected creators when it comes to several topics. Changing the way they approach who on YouTube is or isn\u2019t verified feels like an additional step to instituting those beliefs.\n\nUnder the new policy, YouTube\u2019s team will handle verification on their end, according to a press release. Channels that meet the new requirements don\u2019t have to apply for verification as it will automatically be handed out.\n\nFollowing the announcement, a number of YouTube creators began complaining, primarily on Twitter, that YouTube was already stripping them of their badges. The company has since released a statement denying the rumors and clarifying its position on the new verification program.\n\nAdditional clarification:\n\n\u2714\ufe0fNo one lost a verification badge today\u2013If you received an email that your channel will no longer be verified, this was just an advanced notice & you can appeal\n\n\u2714\ufe0fThe checkmark has never appeared on YouTube mobile channel pages (this will be added soon) https://t.co/vv64ClfuBx \u2014 YouTube Creators (@YTCreators) September 19, 2019\n\nThe tweet also specified that checkmarks never appeared on the mobile app, which is where many screenshots circulating around Twitter were originating. YouTube will add the feature soon. \u201cWe\u2019re making this change to help everyone determine whether a channel is the official YouTube presence of the creator they\u2019re looking for,\u201d an additional tweet reads. \u201cPlease know that badge or no badge, you\u2019re an important part of YouTube.\u201d\n\nUpdate September 19th, 6:10PM ET: Added new statement from YouTube.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story stated that musicians would get a new icon to represent their verification. Instead, they are losing an icon. It will be replaced with the same grey background that other verified YouTube creators will have. The story has been updated to reflect these changes.", "description": "YouTube is rolling out changes to its verification program for creators, making it tougher for growing channels to earn a checkmark beside their name and removing verification badges from people who don\u2019t meet the heightened criteria.
