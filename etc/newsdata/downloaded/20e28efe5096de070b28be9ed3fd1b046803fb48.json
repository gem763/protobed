His fourth novel, \u201cThe Satanic Verses,\u201d inspired the Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran to issue a fatwa in 1989 calling for his assassination. In a matter of days, this writer of brilliant, magical fiction was forced into hiding and became the most famous novelist in the world \u2014 a villainous apostate to conservative Muslims, a cause celebre to defenders of free speech and a figure of intense curiosity for millions.\n\nIn short, Rushdie\u2019s books are now more closely scrutinized.\n\nThat\u2019s a painful process for \u201cQuichotte,\u201d an alternately cerebral and goofy novel that has just been shortlisted for the Booker Prize. A homage to the wide-ranging wit and vision of Cervantes\u2019s early-17th-century tale, \u201cQuichotte\u201d attempts to bring a similarly wry eye to the culture and politics of the early 21st century. So long as you can hum \u201cThe Impossible Dream,\u201d you\u2019ll catch the broad parallels between these two stories. Cervantes immortalized an old Spanish nobleman who goes mad from reading chivalric romances; Rushdie presents a worn-out pharmaceutical salesman from India who goes mad from watching TV.\n\nAn inability to distinguish truth from fiction is not usually a handicap for a drug company rep, but as the novel begins, Rushdie\u2019s quixotic hero is forced into retirement. No matter. He nurses one great passion: He\u2019s insanely obsessed with an Oprah-like talk-show star named Salma R. \u201cHe had eschewed all thoughts of love for what seemed like an eternity,\u201d Rushdie writes, \u201cuntil Miss Salma R reawakened feelings and desires in his breast which he had thought he had suppressed or even destroyed.\u201d Freed from the encumbrances of his job, he adopts the name Quichotte, starts mailing Salma R beautifully handwritten love letters and begins driving across America in his old gunmetal gray Chevy Cruze to find her.\n\nAdventures ensue ad absurdum.\n\nQuichotte is \u201ca student of the arts of wishing,\u201d and early on his trip he imagines a longed-for son into uncertain existence. \u201cMy silly little Sancho,\u201d he cries, \u201cmy son, my sidekick, my squire! Hutch to my Starsky, Spock to my Kirk, Scully to my Mulder, BJ to my Hawkeye, Robin to my Batman! Peele to my Key, Stimpy to my Ren, Niles to my Frazier, Arya to my Hound! Peggy to my Don, Jesse to my Walter, Tubbs to my Crockett, I love you!\u201d\n\n\u201cCut it out, \u2018Dad,\u2019 \u201d the imaginary young man replies. \u201cWhat\u2019s in all this for me?\u201d\n\nReaders will soon be asking themselves the same question. That long list of TV partners is an indication of the novel\u2019s chronic lack of restraint. Rushdie\u2019s style once unfurled with hypnotic elegance, but here it\u2019s become a fire hose of brainy gags and literary allusions \u2014 tremendously clever but frequently tedious.\n\n\n\nThe author Salman Rushdie. (Rachel Eliza Griffiths)\n\nThe animus of this chaotic novel would seem to be Rushdie\u2019s abiding horror at the political ascension of a dissembling reality TV star. Donald Trump\u2019s name doesn\u2019t appear in these pages, but he\u2019s clearly the \u201cwholly imaginary chief executive who was obsessed by cable news, who pandered to a white supremacist base.\u201d Trump is the subterranean crisis of \u201cQuichotte,\u201d the bloated embodiment of America\u2019s conflation of fact and fantasy.\n\nAs Quichotte and his real/not-real son, Sancho, drive toward New York, they offer a picaresque vision of a nation intoxicated on apocalyptic dread. Across the United States, they\u2019re confronted by violent and racist yahoos. \u201cYou got a bad foreign look to you,\u201d one typically ignorant woman seethes.\n\nNewly minted Sancho becomes the innocent conscience of the story, appraising a country boiling with suspicion and hatred. Zapping through TV channels in a cheap hotel, he hears white Americans screaming: \u201cWe are Beavis and Butt-Head on \u2019roids. We drink Roundup from the can. Our president looks like a Christmas ham and talks like Chucky. We\u2019re America. . . . Immigrants raping our women every day. We need Space Force because Space ISIS.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, \u201cQuichotte\u201d is such a brittle pinwheel of parody that its sharp edges never cut very deep. Much of the novel is a satire of TV stars and by extension the easily manipulated country that adores them. Meanwhile, racism, the opioid crisis, Brexit, gun control, immigration, assisted suicide, corporate fraud, the existence of God, sexual abuse, cyberterrorism \u2014 these issues rumble by just as fast as that old Chevy Cruze can drive. Then Jiminy Cricket pops up \u2014 yep \u2014 and another town is overrun with mastodons. A statue of Hans Christian Andersen talks. Whatever.\n\n\u201cIt may be argued,\u201d Rushdie interjects, \u201cthat stories should not sprawl in this way . . . yet so many of today\u2019s stories are and must be of this plural, sprawling kind.\u201d There\u2019s some truth to this gesture toward the great novels of Jonathan Franzen, Zadie Smith, Richard Powers and, yes, Salman Rushdie, but passing off that claim here in this winking, ironic way only draws more attention to the ramshackle structure of \u201cQuichotte.\u201d\n\nI barely have the heart to tell you that this modern-day take on Don Quixote is merely a story within another story. Early on, Rushdie reveals that we\u2019re reading a manuscript being written by a middling spy novelist who wants to write \u201ca book radically unlike any other he had ever attempted . . . picaresque and crazy and dangerous.\u201d Naturally, there are parallels between Quichotte\u2019s quest and the spy novelist\u2019s travails, including his own lost son and his own descent into fantasy. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d Rushdie writes in his loudest stage whisper, \u201cthis bizarre story was a metamorphosed version of his own.\u201d\n\nBy this point, I was hoping a windmill would fall on me.\n\nEven as its various subplots shamble on, the novel keeps reminding us about the rising conflation of reality and fiction. Several of these characters fret about who really made them, which makes the book feel like a three-week road trip with Pirandello nattering on in the back seat with a bag of Cheetos. \u201cThe boundary between art and life became blurred and permeable,\u201d Rushdie writes. All this is in service to the deadeningly commonplace observation that \u201cthere\u2019s no true anymore that anyone can agree on.\u201d\n\nIt would be easier to step over these thematic bricks thrown in our path if the novel\u2019s characters offered any emotional substance, but by design they\u2019re just constructs in this literary game. And so we die-hard fans of Salman Rushdie keep turning the pages, hoping for a reward commensurate to the journey.\n\nAlas, that\u2019s starting to feel like an impossible dream.\n\nRon Charles writes about books for The Washington Post and hosts TotallyHipVideoBookReview.com.
