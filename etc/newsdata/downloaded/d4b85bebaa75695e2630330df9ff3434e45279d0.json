How did the 32-year-old choose to prepare? By playing in a school hall in the middle of the Austrian mountains.\n\nThe spruce-lined gym/auditorium in Schwarzenberg (pop 1,790) in west Austria is fancier than most village halls, even if surrounded by nothing but fields and mountains. It also attracts musicians and music lovers from all over the world for the Schubertiade festival, who have been descending each year on this village since the festival\u2019s formation in 1976.\n\nSo, no, this was no ordinary warm-up for the Beethoven box-set launch. Levit, one of today\u2019s biggest piano stars, was accompanist to the Chinese violinist Ning Feng in an all-Schubert programme. They partnered each other beautifully in tone, general musicality and sense of phrase. Outside, the sun bathed the fields in a warm haze; inside, two friends were at ease with Schubert and each other, and they were clearly enjoying themselves. That\u2019s part of the spirit of this festival.\n\nLess relaxed was Feng playing of a solo violin arrangement of Erlk\u00f6nig \u2013 demented, demotic and howling. Most pianists dread having to perform it, but Feng knocked it off as if it was a technical study. (His Stradivarius may need a rest, though.)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A bitter, shocking twist \u2026 Kit Armstrong with the Schumann Quartet.

The contrasting textures between piano and harmonium are always intriguing, but the most memorable moments were poignant singing by Slovakian soprano Simona \u0160aturov\u00e1.\n\nOne of the tests of a good performance is whether the players can persuade an audience to hear familiar music with new ears. The Schumann Quartet \u2013 three brothers Schumann and the Estonian violist Liisa Randalu \u2013 managed it with a subtle and beautifully inflected performance of Schubert\u2019s String Quartet in G, D 887.\n\nAlfred Brendel\u2019s young protege Kit Armstrong joined them for C\u00e9sar Franck\u2019s piano quintet. In the middle of so much classicism, this was a bitter, shocking twist. No wonder so many in the audience for its 1879 premiere had found it morally troubling, with its pulsating, voluptuous cycles of charge and release.\n\nAustria\u2019s Martin Mitterrutzner and German pianist Gerold Huber performed Die Sch\u00f6ne M\u00fcllerin. Huber was an exemplary accompanist. Mitterrutzner is a full-blown operatic tenor, which is not to all tastes in this kind of lieder. But the second half of the cycle is so full of passion and anguish that reservations melted away.\n\nFinally, Swiss pianist Francesco Piemontesi performed a programme of impromptus and a late Schubert sonata. His sibilant pianissimo stays in the memory, even if he played the first movement of the D major sonata, D 850 as if worrying about missing a bus.\n\nFestival director Gerd Nachbauer has overseen the musical and artist programme for more than 40 years. The format is so successful, it is little wonder that not much changes from year to year. He may shudder at the thought of including Birtwistle or Boulez, but he has an ear for outstanding emerging talent and for luring the best performers in the world back to this little village hall year after year.\n\n\u2022 Schubertiade festival runs until 9 October.", "description": "The festival sticks closely to its relatively narrow musical margins, but with world-class musicians offering fresh insights into familiar works, there was plenty to intrigue and move audiences", "authors": ["Alan Rusbridger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24ae216c4dcf68b852a8fd1f8a5f8db6ec65f633/653_73_2639_1584/master/2639.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c121a90dd502c77d87520c3279cf7376"}
