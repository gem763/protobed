This Euro 2020 qualifier has to be a watershed moment, a seminal moment when this \u201cabhorrent racist abuse\u201d as the Football Association immediately and unequivocally called it in their statement demanding a Uefa investigation has to stop.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nEngland acted with utter dignity and professionalism throughout, with the game stopped twice in the first-half because of the abuse, and sent out a message to the world beyond the emphatic score-line of England 6 Racists 0.\n\nThey could have walked off unilaterally \u2013 and no-one would surely have disagreed if they did - but instead they steadfastly followed the Uefa protocols, they reported what they heard and they made their point with their football and their impeccable behaviour. Croatian referee Ivan Bebek did give England the option of leaving the pitch for 10 minutes after the second incident on 43 minutes but, because it was so close to half-time, Gareth Southgate said he would wait until then and speak to his players in the dressing room. After what had happened in Montenegro \u2013 when Sterling and Danny Rose were abused - they must have been sorely tempted to take their own action.\n\n\u201cI know whatever we do might be perceived as not being enough but we have made a major statement,\u201d Southgate rightly said. No-one could dispute that and the England manager was as dignified as ever even if, at times, he looked like he had had enough.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut the players wanted to continue. They wanted to finish it, win the game and not let the racists triumph and they did that emphatically. There were six goals. There could have been 10. In the back of their minds there will have been a desire to bounce back from the disappointing defeat against the Czech Republic and their powers of concentration were remarkable.\n\nNow the pressure has to be relentless on the authorities to act and we are not talking about paltry fines or points deductions. It was utterly appalling and the only measure is to throw Bulgaria, with their ridiculous denials, out of the competition. This is, was and always will be completely unacceptable. There has to be no compromise.\n\nTyrone Mings, on his England debut, was the first to report the racism \u2013 what a tainted evening of mixed emotions for the indomitable defender who was outstanding - but it was also directed at Raheem Sterling (again) and Marcus Rashford with monkey chants while some Bulgarian fans were clearly shown doing Nazi salutes with members of the FA\u2019s backroom staff visibly upset.\n\nThe Bulgarians \u2013 suffering a partial stadium closure because of a previous racist incident \u2013 were warned before kick off with a tannoy message and then with two more announcements during the first-half with matters even more confused by Bulgarian fans apparently fighting among themselves and a group of 50 black-shirted fans from Plovdiv \u2013 the so-called \u2018lauta army\u2019 \u2013 forced to leave. At half-time the Bulgarian captain Ivelin Popov came out to plead with the fans to behave themselves.\n\nThe racists were embarrassed with this crushing result with the Bulgarian coach Krasmir Balakov asked questions about why his team played like football \u201cdwarves\u201d as his nation suffered their biggest ever defeat in a qualifier with some devastating play by England. With Kosovo beating Montenegro England have to wait a little longer to qualify for Euro 2020 but France\u2019s draw with Russia in their group means if they do win their final three matches they will definitely be seeded next summer.\n\nIt is hard to write about the actual football but because the England players said they wanted to be recognised for this and the way they performed it does need to be documented. Bulgaria were taken apart. Rashford, one of five changes from Prague, opened the scoring as he collected the ball from Ross Barkley, another. Rashford feinted to cross, cut back inside and struck a powerful right-foot cross-shot that caught out goalkeeper Plamen Iliev.\n\nThe second goal was even more impressive. There was a patient build-up, wonderfully constructed with Sterling and Kane quickening the pace with an exchange of passes that ended with Sterling firing in a cross that Ross Barkley turned into the net at the far post.\n\nA message to Uefa Credit: Action Images via Reuters\n\nEngland\u2019s professionalism shone. After the first racist stoppage they quickly scored again with Kane delivering an in-swinging cross which Barkley, ghosting in, met and stooped to head in. That the fourth goal came soon after the second stoppage showed England\u2019s unshakeable determination to ram their message home with Kane squaring across the six-yard area for a simple tap-in for Sterling.\n\nIf there had been another incident in the second-half Southgate said the players would have come off. There were reports of further chants but not verified by the England players who completely dominated and scored again with that awesome combination of Kane and Sterling leading to the latter sweeping the ball in as he ran through.\n\nSAM WALLACE: England will be applauded for handling of racist abuse but to send out the strongest message this match should have been stopped | @SamWallaceTelhttps://t.co/MWRuFvyrix \u2014 Telegraph Football (@TeleFootball) October 14, 2019\n\nKane struck a post, as did Rashford with the last kick of the game but before that the England captain did finally score with a crisp left-foot finish. It was his 28th goal in 43 games and he has struck in all the qualifiers so far.\n\nBut it was not a game for records, though, except that hopefully it will be remembered not especially for the result and performance but \u2013 far more importantly \u2013 about what it means for football and how it has to act following this. It has to be that moment. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to go through an incredible amount,\u201d Southgate said. He and the players have done their bit, they have fulfilled their duties and done the sport a favour. Now the world of football owes them the appropriate response.\n\n10:50PM\n\nThat'll do it from me\n\nEngland won the match, many people are hoping that something more important may have been gained: the statement that we won't put up with racism and that we will stop football matches. Whether there was enough evidence of racism after the 'second warning' to stop this match itself is a matter of opinion, I guess. All in all, a thoroughly grim night but maybe, just maybe, something will come of it. Kudos to Gareth Southgate and his team, who handled themselves with grace. Goodnight from me and thanks for following with us.\n\n10:29PM\n\nThe legend of Gareth\n\ngrew a bit more tonight, many will feel.

If Raheem Sterling was - as it seemed on ITV - abused in second half, why is that not strike three? \u2014 Alan Tyers (@alantyers) October 14, 2019\n\n10:10PM\n\nBut what is the protocol?\n\nRaheem Sterling was abused in the second half as well, which would have been \"third offence\".

We have a lot of players of different ethnicities and skin colour. I don\u2019t think we have as a big a problem like, for example, England do.\n\n\u201cIn the Bulgarian championship, we have not had such problems while there have been incidents in all levels of English football involving racism. I consider that something normal because it is a big country with a very diverse population. But we don\u2019t have this problem in Bulgaria - I can assure you of that.\u201d\n\nBulgaria does not have racism problem but English football does, says head coach Krassimir Balakov on eve of qualifier\n\nAlso widely quoted as saying: \"I would like to focus on football because at the end of the day we are all civilised Europeans and we are all working for this sport. That is all that matters.\"\n\n6:46PM\n\nBulgarian woes\n\nKrasimir Balakov is the manager: he was part of that excellent 1994 team that got to the World Cup semis. But it has not been a happy start. He has been in charge for five matches, and has lost four of them. Bulgaria lost three qualifiers, including an 0-4 pumping from England, lost a friendly to Ireland, and managed an 0-0 away in Montenegro in their last fixture.

Gareth Southgate's side can book their place with a win and a little help from elsewhere: specifically, if Kosovo fail to get three points against Montenegro. It's going to be a formality sooner or later but Southgate will be extremely keen to get back on track after a defeat to the Czech Republic last time out. England so rarely lose a qualifying match that it was at once both a bit of a shocker and no big deal, but the fact remains that England are not a defensively viable proposition and will, one would imagine, continue to struggle against the genuine top sides until they can defend properly.\n\nThe good people on our podcast discuss whether everyone is overreacting or not.\n\nAnd there is an opportunity to for Tyrone Mings to make a mark at international level.\n\nPlenty to enjoy about the England side at the other end of the pitch, of course, with Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling and Jadon Sancho as good a front three as we could ask for. Kane continues to bang them in despite being a little short of his best - and Sam Wallace has the lowdown on that.\n\nAnd, as ever with England abroad, there is the off-field action to keep an eye on. One England fan has died in Sofia today.\n\nKick off is at 7.45pm tonight and we will have the confirmed team news any minute now.", "description": "England left Bulgaria with three points, six goals and surely one line finally drawn in the sand.
