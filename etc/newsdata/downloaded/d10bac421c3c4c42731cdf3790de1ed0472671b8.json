After three weeks of testimony, a Salt Lake City jury deliberated for two days before finding Shamo guilty of running a national drug-trafficking operation and distributing fentanyl-laced counterfeit pills in all 50 states.\n\nHis legal troubles began three years earlier, in Cottonwood Heights, Utah, when federal agents wearing oxygen tanks and protective suits raided his home and two nearby stash houses. The November 2016 drug bust proved to be one of the largest in the state\u2019s history, resulting in a seizure of more than 74,000 fentanyl pills and $1.2 million stuffed in a sock drawer and a safe.\n\nAccording to a story published by the Associated Press and the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, Shamo\u2019s trial detailed the ease with which fentanyl, a synthetic opioid chemically similar to morphine but 50 to 100 times more potent, is bought and distributed across the globe.\n\nShamo built a multimillion-dollar opioid ring and operated what he called \u201chis empire\u201d from a basement in suburban Utah, using a handful of friends, Internet access and a mailbox.\n\n[Follow The Post\u2019s investigation of the opioid epidemic]\n\nThe group began by selling Adderall, a prescription drug used to treat attention-deficit disorder, but soon moved on to more serious drugs. According to prosecutors, Shamo, a former Eagle Scout and college dropout, \u201cestablished himself as the CEO of a nationwide drug distribution network\" and became a \u201cdrug dealer to other drug dealers.\u201d\n\nThey bought fentanyl powder from an online marketplace and received the order by mail in packages shipped from China, one of the main global sources of the drug. (The other is Mexican cartels.)\n\nShamo and his co-workers also bought pill presses and used them to manufacture fake tablets of Xanax, an anti-anxiety medication, and what prosecutors called \u201cpoison\u201d painkillers \u2014 shaped and stamped like legitimate pharmaceutical drugs. Then they resold the pills on the dark-net marketplace and distributed them via the U.S. mail.\n\n\u201cEvidence showed Shamo received messages from customers that they were getting sick,\u201d the Utah U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office said in a statement after the verdict. His response was to send more pills to the complaining customers.\n\n\u201cThere was no shortage of fake pain pills,\" the statement said. \"Co-defendants in the case, who were responsible for packaging and shipping, used a vacuum to clean up pills from the floor because they believed it was not worth their time to pick them up because of the volume of pills they were manufacturing.\u201d\n\nIn a criminal case, federal law enforcement considers an undercover purchase of 100 pills of Oxycodone to be substantial. Shamo, prosecutors said, sold at least half a million pills over about two years.\n\n\n\nFrom left, Drew Crandall, Aaron Shamo and Sean Gygi. Prosecutors said Shamo built a multimillion-dollar fentanyl trafficking empire from his computer with help from Crandall and Gygi. (AP)\n\nShamo\u2019s verdict arrived weeks before OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma and its owners, the Sackler family, reached a tentative deal with 23 states and thousands of local governments that, if finalized, would be the first wide-ranging settlement to hold a drug company accountable over its role in the opioid crisis, which has taken more than 200,000 lives through overdoses since 1999, according to federal statistics. The negotiated terms required the Sacklers to relinquish control of Purdue Pharma but admit to no wrongdoing.\n\nThe widespread abuse of fentanyl, which began in 2013, has become the deadliest drug epidemic in American history.\n\nThe Washington Post previously reported: \u201cFrom 2013 through 2017, more than 67,000 people died of synthetic-opioid-related overdoses, the majority of them from fentanyl. In 2018, another 31,473 Americans died, according to the latest available figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u201d\n\n[DEA raids colossal fentanyl operation. Could produce thousands of pills per hour.]\n\nThe most common distribution method for fentanyl is the U.S. Postal Service, a fact the Treasury Department acknowledged in an August statement announcing sanctions against three Chinese nationals accused of trafficking fentanyl.\n\nThat, according to the Associated Press, is how federal authorities\u2019 attention turned to Shamo. By then, though, he had already produced nearly half a million potentially lethal pills and earned millions of dollars in cash and cryptocurrencies selling them on the dark web.\n\n[The flow of fentanyl: In the mail, over the border]\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that this individual is responsible for hundreds of thousands, more likely millions, of counterfeit tablets going across the continental United States,\u201d DEA Special Agent Brian Besser said at the time of Shamo\u2019s arrest.\n\n\u201cThese counterfeit pills have fentanyl being put into them, and there is no control mechanism, there is no regulation method. So one person may get a pill out of a counterfeit batch and take it and use it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe second person may take the pill and die almost immediately.\u201d Because some of the drugs were marketed as less powerful narcotics, like Oxycodone, they posed an extra danger to users unprepared to ingest fentanyl.\n\nAlthough prosecutors alleged connections between Shamo and several overdoses, he was only charged in connection with one \u2014 a 21-year-old man in California.\n\nThe jury convicted Shamo of 12 counts, including continuing criminal enterprise, which carries a mandatory minimum of life in prison. Jurors were unable to reach a verdict on the single count accusing Shamo of causing another person\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cThe opioid epidemic is something we all read and hear about every day, and [Shamo] was very much a part of it \u2014 he was dealing opioids,\u201d attorney Greg Skordas, who represented Shamo, told The Washington Post on Tuesday. At trial, the defense tried to avoid the mandatory life sentence by arguing that Shamo was not the leader of the drug ring, but one of several participating members.\n\nSkordas continued, \u201cHe was 26 years old when he was arrested, and he will never walk out of prison. The prospect of spending the rest of your life there seems incredibly disproportionate.\u201d\n\nShamo is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 3.\n\n\n\nInvestigators found this money in Aaron Shamo's Utah home.
