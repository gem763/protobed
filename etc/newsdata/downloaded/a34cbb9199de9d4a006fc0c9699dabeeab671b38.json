The per-prisoner bill in 2012 at the \u201csupermax\u201d facility in Colorado, home to some of the highest-risk prisoners in the United States, was $78,000.\n\nThen there is Guant\u00e1namo Bay, where the expense now works out to about $13 million for each of the 40 prisoners being held there.\n\nAccording to a tally by The New York Times, the total cost last year of holding the prisoners \u2014 including the men accused of plotting the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks \u2014 paying for the troops who guard them, running the war court and doing related construction, exceeded $540 million.\n\nThe $13 million per prisoner cost almost certainly makes Guant\u00e1namo the world\u2019s most expensive detention program.
