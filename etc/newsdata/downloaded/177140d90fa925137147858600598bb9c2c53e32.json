The screen of my electronic Nosy Parker continually flashes with urgent queries about how I enjoyed my coffee, my snack, my gelato. And for some reason, it keeps giving me updates on Chicago White Sox games.\n\n\u201cPlease rate your trip to Bellas Restaurant, using numbers one through five,\u201d it says. \u201cYour opinion is important to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhite Sox 5, Twins 4. Bottom of the sixth.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t actually mind being queried about my comings and goings, nor about my tastes. I know that my phone is merely trying to gather information that can be passed on to other consumers. It is not spying on me. It is not dogging my every heel. And I honestly do believe that my opinion is important to it. There is no reason why my phone would lie to me about something like that.\n\n\u201c A phone has no sense of scale or perspective, and it certainly has no sense of occasion. \u201d\n\nBut one thing does bother me about the way my phone frames its questions. To a smartphone, the landscape is always flat. A phone has no sense of scale or perspective, and it certainly has no sense of occasion. For example, it does not surprise me when my phone asks me to rate the Grand Canyon or the Museo del Prado when I have just seen them. But I don\u2019t like when it pesters me about my latest trip to the hardware store or the barber shop. And I hate when it keeps asking: \u201cHow was your visit to 17-19 North Broadway?\u201d I\u2019ve been working in the same building at 17-19 North Broadway for 26 years. Stop asking.\n\nWhy is my phone asking me to opine on a building, or a footpath, or telling me about a team in which I have no earthly interest? I have no idea. Of course, I suspect some weird liaison among Google Maps, TripAdvisor , Yelp and possibly the NSA. Or maybe a rogue operating system. A bewildering array of apps appears to claim credit for the bewildering array of demands for my thoughts, but since I never turned these urgent flashes on, I have no sense that I can turn them off.\n\nOne thing that I find massively annoying about my compulsively inquisitive device is when I have just had an absolutely terrible experience and my phone\u2014guileless, unsophisticated, bereft of all social graces\u2014asks if I enjoyed it.\n\nWhen I have just been caught in a deluge while walking along the Hudson, I do not want to be asked: \u201cHow was your trip to Horan\u2019s Landing?\u201d When I have just had a meal so bad I could actually see the jockey\u2019s whip marks on the burger, I do not want to be asked if my trip to the fast-food joint was all that I hoped it would be. When I have been to an appalling concert, a horrendous play, a crummy art exhibition or a disastrous football game, I don\u2019t want to be badgered about it seconds after I leave the venue. And when the Phillies have just lost 13-1 to the Mets, I do not want to be told that the White Sox squeaked by the Indians 2-1.\n\nI am sure that many historical figures would have been similarly irritated had this sort of intrusive technology flourished in their own eras.\n\nTell me, Julius, \u201cHow was your trip to the Roman Senate on the Ides of March? On a scale of one-to-five, how would you rate the experience?\u201d\n\nHey, Lt. Col. Custer, \u201cPlease rate your trip to the Little Big Horn. Do you have any photos to share? Can you think of any ways your Little Big Horn experience could have been improved? By the way, the Chicago White Stockings beat the A\u2019s 5-4.\u201d\n\nWhat worries me most is the possibility that things could get worse. Suppose my phone, noticing that I have just visited a hospital, asks me to rate my heart operation. Suppose it asks me to report on my visit to Sing-Sing? Suppose it\u2019s still in my pocket at my funeral and asks how I enjoyed my trip to Beatific Vistas Cemetery?\n\nThat\u2019ll be the last question it ever asks.", "description": "It would have quizzed Custer on how he enjoyed Little Big Horn.", "authors": ["Joe Queenan"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-EX068_QUEENA_SOC_20190905114522.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
