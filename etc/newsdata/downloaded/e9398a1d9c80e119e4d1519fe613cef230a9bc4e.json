Let\u2019s seek some clarity about the sources of discomfort.\n\nThe Benedict Option, as I understand it, is based on three premises.\n\nThe dominant media of our technological society are powerful forces for socializing people into modes of thought and action that are often inconsistent with, if not absolutely hostile to, Christian faith and practice. In America today, churches and other Christian institutions (schools at all levels, parachurch organizations with various missions) are comparatively very weak at socializing people, if for no other reason than that they have access to comparatively little mindspace. Healthy Christian communities are made up of people who have been thoroughly grounded in, thoroughly socialized into, the the historic practices and beliefs of the Christian church.\n\nFrom these three premises proponents of the Benedict Option draw a conclusion: If we are to form strong Christians, people with robust commitment to and robust understanding of the Christian life, then we need to shift the balance of ideological power towards Christian formation, and that means investing more of our time and attention than we have been spending on strengthening our Christian institutions.\n\nI have to say that I simply do not see how any thoughtful Christian could disagree with any of these premises or the conclusion that follows from them. If any of you do so dissent, please let me know how and why \u2014 I would greatly benefit from hearing your views.\n\nSo what\u2019s the problem? My sense is that many of you shy away from Rod\u2019s rhetoric, which you believe alarmist. But in itself that\u2019s a shallow reason for setting aside the whole BenOp argument. Rod has already begun to identify some of the communities which he believes to be doing the BenOp right \u2014 do you think they aren\u2019t? Do you think they\u2019ve gone astray? If so, please explain how.\n\nThe critical responses to the BenOp I\u2019ve seen have struck me as merely visceral. I\u2019d like to see more careful and thorough articulation of the critiques. But if you don\u2019t believe that the three premises I\u2019ve listed above are true, then I think you\u2019re whistling past the graveyard. And if you accept the premises but don\u2019t agree with the conclusion, then we definitely need to do some exercises in logic.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/blog.ayjay.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/cropped-AngryIcon.jpg?fit=512%2C512&ssl=1", "published_at": "2016-06-01"}
