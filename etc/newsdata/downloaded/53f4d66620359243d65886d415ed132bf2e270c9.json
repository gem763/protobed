The institute, which supports abortion rights, periodically compiles abortion data by surveying hospitals and abortion clinics, and by reviewing information from health departments and other sources.\n\nThe institute estimated that there were about 862,000 abortions in 2017, nearly 200,000 fewer than in 2011. The abortion rate \u2014 the number of abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age \u2014 dropped to 13.5 in 2017 from 16.9 in 2011, the lowest rate since abortion became legal nationwide in 1973.\n\nThe report suggests that one reason for the decrease might be the growing use of long-term contraceptive methods, like intrauterine devices and implants, which are now covered by insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Birthrates have also declined.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Science Americas-Abortion-Rate-Has-Dropped-To-Its-Lowest-Ever.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
