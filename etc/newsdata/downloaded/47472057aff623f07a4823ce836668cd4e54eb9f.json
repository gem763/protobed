The California-based company said its message hasn't changed; instead it's revising the website to add more information.\n\n\"Improving human health is a core tenet of our brand,\" said spokesperson Allison Aronoff in an email.\n\nIt appears that sometime after Sept. 11, Beyond Meat removed a startling graphic which stated that eating meat increases the chances of getting cancer by 16 per cent and the chances of developing heart disease by 21 per cent.\n\nA footnote below the graphic said the numbers were associated with processed meats \u2014 which excludes fresh beef \u2014 and based on a scientific study. An internet search found that it was a Harvard Study published in 2012 and the processed meats subjects ate included hot dogs and bacon.\n\nAccording to an internet archive search, sometime after Sept. 11, Beyond Meat removed this graphic from its website which included claims about the health risks of eating meat. (Beyond Meat)\n\nThe removed graphic also included statistics about how raising livestock harms the environment.\n\nA second colourful segment stating that plant-based proteins help improve human health and the environment remains on the site.\n\nWhen asked about the missing graphic, Aronoff said Beyond Meat is changing things up.\n\n\"We are in the process of updating our website to share additional information around the multiple benefits of our products to further help consumers make an informed decision around the food they eat.\"\n\nBeyond Meat's website still shows this graphic which explains the purported benefits of eating plant-based burgers. (Beyond Meat)\n\nIn July, a CBC News story included a link to the now-removed statistics and quoted nutrition experts who said the evidence isn't there \u2014 at least not yet \u2014 to declare that a processed plant-based burger is healthier than beef.\n\n\"Where is their research saying that \u2014 that this is better than eating a small, portion-controlled, lean piece of meat?\" said Toronto-based dietitian and nutritionist Rosie Schwartz.\n\nFood policy expert Sylvain Charlebois said a company can expect criticism when making claims based on science which is still in flux.\n\nHe points to a controversial new study where a team of international researchers concluded that adults don't need to cut back on eating red and processed meat \u2014 because the purported health risks are small and uncertain.\n\n\"Science is not an absolute, things evolve,\" said Charlebois, a professor at Dalhousie University specializing in food distribution and policy.\n\nBeyond Meat stands by its health claims, telling CBC News that its plant-based products offer the \"delicious taste\" of meat, but with more protein and iron and less fat and no cholesterol.\n\nIt's not meat\n\nBeyond Meat's burger has exploded in popularity with consumers looking for meat alternatives. But the company has also generated criticism for its marketing techniques.\n\nCharlebois said Beyond Meat invited the controversy by making comparisons to meat.\n\n\"They provoke the marketplace,\" he said. \"If you start comparing your product with other products, you're bound to make enemies.\"\n\nIt's not just nutrition experts who have raised questions. Canadian Cattle farmers have a beef with marketing that promotes the Beyond burger as \"meat.\"\n\nThe Quebec Cattle Producers Federation has filed two complaints with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) on the issue, and has the backing of the Canadian Cattlemen's Association.\n\nThe first complaint, launched in January, took issue with A&W's French-language ads which promoted the Beyond Meat burger sold in its restaurants as \"fait de viande vegetale\" or \"vegetable-made meat.\"\n\nThe Quebec Cattle Producers Federation took issue with A&W's French-language ads which promoted the Beyond Meat burger sold in its restaurants as 'fait de viande vegetale' -- vegetable-made meat. (A&W/YouTube)\n\nThe federations' second complaint, launched in May, objected to Beyond Meat referring to its burger as \"plant-based meat\" in promotional material and on product packaging in grocery stores.\n\nThe federation bases its complaints on CFIA's definition of a meat product which states it must come from animal flesh.\n\n\"Meat is from a carcass. There's nothing that says meat can be plant-based,\" said Kirk Jackson, a cattle farmer and the vice-president of the Quebec Cattle Producers Federation.\n\n\"We just want a fair level playing field.\"\n\nHe reports the federation has so far achieved a partial win as restaurant chain A&W has agreed to change or remove any advertising referring to its Beyond burger as a meat product.\n\nThe company's current French slogan for the burger is \"vrai bon burger\" or \"truly good burger.\"\n\nKirk Jackson is a cattle producer in Saint-Anicet, Que., and serves as the vice-president of the Quebec Cattle Producers Federation. (Isaac Olson/CBC)\n\nJackson believes the outcome is a positive sign that the federation will also be successful in getting Beyond Meat to stop calling its product a plant-based meat.\n\n\"I'm hoping it's going to be like this [outcome],\" he said. \"It's just abiding by the rules.\"\n\nBoth A&W and CFIA declined to comment on the issue. Beyond Meat told CBC News in May that it \"takes regulatory compliance very seriously\" and is \"reviewing internally to ensure we comply with Canadian regulations.\"", "description": "Beyond Meat has dropped from its website statistics about the health risks of eating meat.
