USA TODAY\n\nHOUSTON \u2013 The spotlight and Anthony Rendon have a way of avoiding each other.\n\nMonday, on the eve of his first World Series game, in the town that groomed him for this stage, Rendon had little choice.\n\nAnd so the Washington Nationals\u2019 All-Star third baseman basked in the glow, letting his personality shine for the entirety of a 45-minute news media session before the team worked out at Minute Maid Park.\n\nNearly every response was punctuated by a giggle, often fueled by Rendon himself, such as when he noted slugger Juan Soto\u2019s propensity for grabbing his crotch between pitches. He called himself a \u201cRedskin for life,\u201d before noting that his alma mater, Lamar High School, eventually changed its mascot to the Texans (unlike the pro team near his current place of employment).\n\nAnd above all, Rendon exuded grace, not just for this opportunity but also his opponent \u2013 a Houston Astros franchise he followed as a youth, with future Hall of Famers Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell his guys.\n\nNATIONALS: History not on Washington's side after LCS sweep\n\n'PARANOIA': Astros, Nationals will keep a close eye on each other\n\nThe current group? Oh, he\u2019ll work out this winter with Astros center fielder and perennial postseason hero George Springer, and they\u2019ll surely have plenty to discuss.\n\nRendon is also appreciative that Springer and Co. brought the 2017 World Series title back to Houston less than two months after Hurricane Harvey devastated the region.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve all been tremendous,\u201d he said of an Astros team back for its second Fall Classic in three years. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve done for this city \u2013 they\u2019ve elevated the morale of this city, especially when natural disasters come hit this way and bring a lot of devastation.\n\n\u201cThe fact they\u2019ve brought so many spirits into a positive light \u2013 I love all those guys for what they\u2019ve done for the city.\u201d\n\nAnthony Rendon speaks to the media on Monday at Minute Maid Park. (Photo: Erik Williams, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nHe termed this scenario \u201cdefinitely a case of mixed emotions,\u201d in that he\u2019s competing for the game\u2019s ultimate prize against the town that made him what he was, from the classmates at Lamar who welcomed him with open arms when he transferred before his junior year, to his years at Rice University, where he polished off the skills that made him a Golden Spikes semifinalist and the sixth overall pick of the Nationals in 2011.\n\nNow, he has a lot of love for both sides \u2013 yet for at least another 10 days, there\u2019s little doubt where the pending free agent\u2019s loyalties ultimately lie.\n\n\u201cYou think about playing for the hometown team growing up \u2013 that\u2019s kind of a best-case scenario,\u201d he says, \u201cbut in the end, I\u2019m just trying to beat who\u2019s on the other side. I don\u2019t care who you are.\u201d", "description": "Rendon, who grew up near Houston and played college ball at Rice, won't soon forget what the Astros did for the city after a devastating hurricane.", "authors": ["Gabe Lacques", "Published P.M.
