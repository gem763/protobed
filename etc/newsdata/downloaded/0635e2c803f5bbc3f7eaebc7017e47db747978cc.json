It\u2019s for the courts to decide the merits of this new challenge and to say in due course whether the Affordable Care Act \u2014 Obamacare \u2014 can stand. In the meantime, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration should wake up to what\u2019s at stake for millions of Americans and start speaking up on their behalf.\n\nLast year, a group of states led by Texas began this fresh attack. Their opening was a 2017 revision to the law that set the penalty for defying the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d at zero. This arguably unmoored the ACA from its constitutional foundations, as laid down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2012. In that ruling, the penalty for defying the mandate to obtain insurance was deemed to be a lawful exercise of Congress\u2019s taxing power; now that the tax is zero, this argument no longer applies, according to the new challenge, so the mandate becomes impermissible under the Constitution\u2019s commerce clause. A federal judge embraced this approach, and ruled the law invalid. The case, Texas v. U.S., is being appealed.\n\nThe Trump administration has taken no clear or consistent position. First, it supported the plaintiffs in part, saying the mandate and other provisions should be struck down, but that the law as a whole ought to stand. Then, it applauded the judge\u2019s ruling and said the ACA should be overturned. Now, it\u2019s saying that the ruling should apply, but only in the states bringing the case. What it will say when it next offers an opinion is anybody\u2019s guess.\n\nHere\u2019s a suggestion. The administration should be explaining that the result of striking down the ACA with no good alternative in place would be something close to chaos. Some 20 million people \u2014 those who benefited from the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion or qualified for subsidized private plans \u2014 might lose their insurance. But that\u2019s not all. More than 100 million people in the U.S. have preexisting conditions; without the protections afforded by the ACA, they\u2019d face higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs. There\u2019d be knock-on effects for people not directly affected. And the disruption could be serious enough to hurt the broader economy.\n\nThe administration keeps promising a comprehensive replacement for Obamacare, but there\u2019s no sign yet of anything plausible. Until the administration has such a plan, and can explain how it will make things better for most Americans, its aim should be to stabilize and improve Obamacare, not see it undermined haphazardly and without regard to the consequences. Until its officials have something better to suggest, it ought to stop equivocating on this legal challenge, explain to the courts what\u2019s at stake, and argue for the ACA to be put on a firm legal footing.\n\n--Editors: Alexis Leondis, Clive Crook.\n\nTo contact the senior editor responsible for Bloomberg Opinion\u2019s editorials: David Shipley at davidshipley@bloomberg.net, .\n\nEditorials are written by the Bloomberg Opinion editorial board.\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com/opinion\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Amid all the attention being paid to Medicare for All and other proposals for health-care reform, you might not have noticed that the current system is once again under legal assault.
