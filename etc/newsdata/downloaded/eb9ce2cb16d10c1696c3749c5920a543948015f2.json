Captain Parisse led the criticism of World Rugby, claiming that the failure to have a back-up Plan B for matches when holding a tournament in the middle of typhoon season was \u201cridiculous\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Rugby World Cup team of round three 1/16 Team of round three From Scotland's demolition of Samoa to France's narrow escape against Tonga, who makes the team of round three? AFP via Getty Images 2/16 1. James Slipper (Australia) Ninety-three Tests had come and gone for the Wallabies loosehead, but it was 94th-time lucky for the Queensland-born prop as he finally scored his first international try in Australia\u2019s 45-10 victory over Uruguay. Getty Images 3/16 2. Mbongeni Mbonambi (South Africa) Mbonambi was excellent at the lineout, finding his jumper on every occasion, but it was his work around the pitch that really stood out in the win over Italy as he bagged himself a try in the process. PA 4/16 3. Angus Ta\u2019avao (New Zealand) The rookie All Blacks prop was thrust into the contest against Namibia early when his team were struggling to break down the African side following Nepo Laulala\u2019s yellow card, but not only did he settle straight into the match, he immediately bagged himself a try that convinced Steve Hansen to leave him on for the rest of the match. Getty Images 5/16 4. Wimpie van der Walt (Japan) The uniquely-named lock led Japan\u2019s defensive charge against Samoa and was dominant in the aerial battle with a 100 per cent lineout effort alongside James Moore, which was made all the more impressive as he didn\u2019t start either of their opening matches. AFP via Getty Images 6/16 5. Sam Whitelock (New Zealand) Captained New Zealand in the absence of Kieran Read and led by example. Whitelock bagged a try himself, didn\u2019t panic when New Zealand were clawed back in the first half and contributed well with the ball in hand. His aggression in kicking for the corner early on paid off with a 71-point return. EPA 7/16 6. Rhys Ruddock (Ireland) Ireland may have been criticised for a drab performance in their victory over Russia, but Ruddock proved the silver lining with a man-of-the-match display that could thrust him into the side for the big contests. AFP via Getty Images 8/16 7. Sam Underhill (England) Another flanker named man of the match, Underhill was England\u2019s defensive heartbeat against Argentina, but also an emphatic carrier who helped set up George Ford\u2019s bonus point-clinching try. PA 9/16 8. Kazuki Himeno (Japan) The Japanese No 8 was one of their top performers against Samoa, carrying well and showing a deft touch with his ability to offload from the tackle. Earmarked as a real star of Japanese rugby, he looks to have real captaincy potential. AFP via Getty Images 10/16 9. Frank Lomani (Fiji) A livewire showing as the beating heart of a Flying Fijian side back at full strength and firing on all cylinders. Scored a try himself and delivered the quick ball that the Pacific Islanders crave to play their unique brand of rugby. AP 11/16 10. Jordie Barrett (New Zealand) Stepped out of the shadow of older brother Beauden to play a starring role in the demolition of Namibia. Scored a try himself but it was the in which he created Anton Lienert-Brown\u2019s score that really stood out, combining power, vision, passing ability and athletic determination to send the centre over. Getty Images 12/16 11. Semi Radradra (Fiji) The star of the side this week. When Radradra is playing his best rugby he is simply unstoppable, and so he proved last week. The Bordeaux back scored twice against Georgia and led pretty much every attacking stats list as the European side failed to shackle is delightful talent. AP 13/16 12. Anton Lienert-Brown (New Zealand) His form is keeping Sonny Bill Williams out of the Test side when New Zealand play their crunch fixtures, but on the weekend\u2019s evidence it was easy to see why. Two tries, the first an eye-catching mazy run from halfway, secures him the No 12 shirt this week, and probably for the All Blacks in the quarter-finals. Getty Images 14/16 13. Timothy Lafaele (Japan) Kicked off the performance against Samoa with their first try, starring with teammate Kotaro Matsushima to tear the Pacific Islanders apart early on and pave the way to their bonus-point victory. AFP via Getty Images 15/16 14. Cheslin Kolbe (South Africa) How do you stop him? The answer is yet to be found, with Kolbe\u2019s low centre of gravity, stunning footwork and Habana-like pace leaving team after team in knots \u2013 this time Italy \u2013 with two tries to kick-start his tally at this World Cup. AFP via Getty Images 16/16 15. Elliot Daly (England) Possibly his best performance for England in the No 15 shirt to date, Daly linked up superbly with Jonny May \u2013 who is hard done by not to make the side this week \u2013 and Anthony Watson in what was a scintillating first half for the English back three.

Getty Images\n\n\"It is difficult to know that we won\u2019t have the chance to play a match against one of the great teams,\u201d said Parisse. \"If New Zealand needed four or five points against us it would not have been cancelled.\n\n\"It is ridiculous that a decision of this nature has been made because it isn\u2019t like the fans arrived yesterday. It is ridiculous that there was no Plan B, because it isn\u2019t news that typhoons hit Japan.\n\n\"Sure, everyone might think that Italy versus New Zealand being cancelled counts for nothing because we\u2019d have lost anyway, but we deserved to be respected as a team.\n\n\"We had the chance to play in a big stadium, against a great team. The alternative is Plan B. When you organise a World Cup you should have one in place. Sure, if Italy and New Zealand decide they don\u2019t want to play, then fine but, as I said before, if New Zealand needed the points, it wouldn\u2019t have been cancelled.\"\n\nParisse was supported by his coach Conor O\u2019Shea, who looks to have taken charge of his final game as Italy boss, and the Irishman was keen to highlight the heartbreak his senior players had felt when they discovered their final pool match was off.\n\n\"For us, it was our next challenge and perhaps for the last time for Sergio, Ale [Alessandro Zanni], and Leo -Leonardo Ghiraldini] to play and the chance to give young players a chance.\n\n\"I'm disappointed for the players, the staff and the fans. I'm sure it was a hard decision for World Rugby. But all the other teams whose matches have been cancelled are already through and we were the only ones who had a chance to qualify.\n\n\"I'm finding it really difficult and I saw the players' reaction after training and it was horrible because these guys have given their lives to Italian rugby and their World Cup has ended on the training pitch, when it should be on the playing field.\u201d\n\nWorse could follow though if Scotland\u2019s and Japan\u2019s encounter on Sunday is cancelled. Hagibis is currently expected to make landfall early on Saturday and work its way up the south-east coastline, passing through Yokohama and Tokyo through the day as well as the rest of the Konto region. By the time kick-off is scheduled at the International Stadium Yokohama Sunday, the typhoon is expected to have passed, which is fuelling Scotland\u2019s optimism that the game will go ahead \u2013 which Scotland need to happen to stand any chance of reaching the quarter-finals.\n\nBut the trail of devastation from Hagibis could well mean that fans are unable to travel to the stadium, or that the game has to be called off entirely if it is unsafe to stage the event, and The Independent understands that the SRU are considering legal action if the match is abandoned.\n\nSpeaking to the media on Thursday, head coach Gregor Townsend took an optimistic approach that he sees no reason why the game should not go ahead. \"We believe that the game hasn\u2019t been cancelled because the weather will be better on Sunday and it looks like the game will be played,\u201d Townsend said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we have to put faith in, that they have made that call with a lot of certainty and confidence that the game will be played on Sunday night.\n\n\"I hope everyone involved in the tournament wants the game to be played and will do their utmost for the game to be played.\n\n\"I have looked at the weather and Sunday night is meant to be nice and calm. Now what may happen is infrastructure may not be in place, even though the weather is nice. We have got to believe, and have faith in the organisers, that the game will be played, even if it is behind closed doors or played at a different venue.\"\n\nTeams less affected by the logistical nightmare took a more relaxed view on the tournament changes, with New Zealand boss Steve Hansen claiming the decision was a \u201cno-brainer\u201d. \"Everyone knew this was a possibility and we knew what the process would be if it did occur. But when you get a typhoon to the level we're getting, safety's a paramount thing.\u201d\n\nEddie Jones added: \"It's not something you can control. This is the situation. I think it's a wonderful World Cup. You can't help typhoons, we would all like to think we've got the power above and beyond what's on the world at the moment, but we don't and these things happen and you just ride with it.\"", "description": "Leading players and coaches have hit out at World Rugby\u2019s decision to cancel two matches at the Rugby World Cup on Thursday, with Italian great Sergio Parisse labelling the move \u201cridiculous\u201d and the looming threat of legal action materialising if Scotland\u2019s showdown with Japan is cancelled.
