LaValle, RPh, CCN, ND. Read additional excerpts or buy the whole book.\n\nDehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a building block of steroid hormones that is produced predominantly in the adrenal glands. It serves as a precursor to the sex hormones testosterone and estrogen in both men and women. DHEA is also a building block of the stress hormone cortisol and supports immune system function. DHEA may also increase insulin sensitivity, enhance fat metabolism, and act as an antioxidant.\n\nThere are two types of dehydroepiandrosterone: DHEA and its sulfate form, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS). Because DHEAS remains in the bloodstream longer the DHEA, doctors generally test DHEAS numbers when they suspect a problem with this hormone. Typically, DHEAS levels are high in newborns and drop significantly after birth. They increase during puberty, peak soon after, and decline with age. Normal ranges are as follows.\n\nREFERENCE RANGES FOR DHEA Category Age DHEAS Normal Range (mcg/dL) Men 18 to 19 108 to 441 20 to 29 280 to 640 30 to 39 120 to 520 40 to 49 95 to 530 50 to 59 70 to 310 60 to 69 42 to 290 69+ 28 to 175 Women 18 to 19 145 to 395 20 to 29 65 to 380 30 to 39 45 to 270 40 to 49 32 to 240 50 to 59 26 to 200 60 to 69 13 to 130 69+ 17 to 90\n\nKeep in mind that reference ranges can differ slightly from lab to lab, so check the listing on your blood test for the range that applies to you.\n\nWHAT CAUSES HIGH DHEA?\n\nDHEA levels are naturally higher during youth, but there are a few conditions that can cause this hormone to become elevated beyond the normal range, including:\n\nAdrenal tumors\n\nHyperplasia (adrenal swelling)\n\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\n\nDHEA levels can vary widely from person to person. Your doctor will be able to verify whether or not the amount of this hormone in your blood is a problem.\n\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF HIGH DHEA?\n\nBecause of its association with both male and female sex hormones, high DHEA levels can create a number of distressing symptoms. They can cause women to develop facial hair, male pattern baldness, and a deeper voice in a process known as masculinization. They can also lead to feminine traits in men, such as increased breast tissue and testicular wasting. Other possible symptoms include fatigue, sweating, and acne.\n\nHOW CAN HIGH DHEA BE TREATED?\n\nBecause high DHEA is mainly associated with medical conditions such as adrenal tumors and PCOS, your doctor will have to treat these underlying issues in order to normalize this hormone.\n\nWHAT CAUSES LOW DHEA?\n\nAlthough DHEA levels decline naturally with age, they may also be lowered by conditions such as:\n\nGet My FREE Curcumin Report Chronic Inflammation Decoded\n\nAutoimmune diseases such Addison\u2019s disease, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis\n\nChronic stress\n\nUnfortunately, some of the medications used to treat symptoms of these illnesses can also deplete DHEA in the body. These drugs include:\n\nCorticosteroids, including dexamethasone (Decadron), methylprednisolone (Medrol), and hydrocortisone\n\nInsulin\n\nPain medications, including opiates and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen (Aleve)\n\nDo not, however, attempt to adjust the dosage of your medication on your own. If your DHEA is low, your doctor will suggest the best way to remedy the problem.\n\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF LOW DHEA?\n\nSymptoms of low DHEA include extreme fatigue, muscle and joint pain, weight gain, trouble sleeping, lowered immunity, loss of sexual interest, decreased bone density, depression, and reduced muscle mass. Pay attention to these signs, as they can lead to conditions such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, or osteoporosis. Interestingly, low DHEA\u2014especially when combined with high cortisol levels\u2014can also damage the hippocampus (memory center of the brain), in turn leading to short-term memory loss.\n\nHOW CAN LOW DHEA BE TREATED?\n\nTo effectively treat low DHEA levels, adjustments to lifestyle and diet are crucial. Supplements can also prove beneficial.\n\nSUPPLEMENTS\n\nThere are several natural products available that can help you cope with stress, as seen in the table below. Do not take any supplement to treat low levels of DHEA without speaking to your doctor first. You should also consult your doctor about exploring other treatment options, such as bioidentical hormone replacement therapy, depending on the underlying cause of your imbalance.\n\nSUPPLEMENTS FOR LOW DHEA Supplement Dosage Considerations Ashwagandha (standardized to 1.5-percent withanolides and 1-percent alkaloids) 450 to 900 mg once a day. Use with caution when taking sedatives and hypnotics such as barbiturates, as their effects may be increased. May also alter thyroid hormone levels, so check with your doctor before using if you have a thyroid disorder. Consult your doctor before taking if you are on blood thinners or antiplatelet drugs. Substances similar to ashwagandha (adaptogens) that may also be beneficial include Rhodiola, American ginseng, and Manchurian ginseng. DHEA 25 to 50 mg once a day. Regular blood tests are required when using this supplement. Do not use if you have a hormonesensitive condition, such as breast cancer or uterine fibroids. Avoid use if you have a mood disorder or depression, liver problems, low HDL cholesterol, PCOS, or are pregnant or breastfeeding. If you are diabetic, monitor your blood sugar closely while taking DHEA. Relora 250 mg two to three times a day. This supplement helps alleviate stress by reducing the body\u2019s physiological response. Since it may cause drowsiness, do not take before driving an automobile or working with or around heavy machinery. Whey protein 44 g once a day (added to a beverage). Studies have shown that whey protein is a form of protein that is both easily digested and superior to other proteins for muscle building. It has also been reported to improve immunity and work as an antioxidant in the body. However, high doses can cause increased bowel movements, nausea, thirst, bloating, cramps, reduced appetite, fatigue, and headaches. Avoid use if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n\nLIFESTYLE CHANGES\n\nIf chronic stress is behind decreased DHEA, do your best to eliminate the source of stress from your life. Getting at least eight hours of sleep every night can also help reduce stress, as can exercising aerobically for approximately thirty minutes a day, three to four times a week. As low DHEA levels may be associated with inflammation, it is wise to cut back on foods that can have an inflammatory reaction in your body, such as refined sugars and carbohydrates, fried food, baked goods, lunch meats, and fast food. Additionally, avoid eating items that may cause hormone imbalances, such as nonorganic meat and dairy, chemical additives and preservatives, and artificial sweeteners. Increase your consumption of antioxidant-rich foods, including yellow and red peppers, squashes, tomatoes, green leafy vegetables, garlic, onions, and cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts. Also, be sure to quit smoking, as this habit negatively affects DHEA levels. In many cases, DHEA levels will return to normal by reducing stress, which decreases the demands of cortisol production in the body. Stress management through yoga, meditiation, or prayer have been shown to have a positive effect on stress response.\n\nRead additional excerpts for free\n\nDid You Enjoy This Article?
