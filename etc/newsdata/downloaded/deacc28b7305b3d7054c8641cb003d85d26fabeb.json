New England attempted to acquire Sanu during the NFL Draft but failed and had to wait several months to get their guy, according to the NFL Network.\n\nSAM DARNOLD'S PERFORMANCE VS. PATRIOTS GETS SPOOKY IN JETS BLOWOUT LOSS: 'I'M SEEING GHOSTS'\n\nSanu is a veteran wide receiver who was in the middle of his fourth season with the Falcons. In seven games this season for the Falcons, he had 33 catches for 313 yards and one touchdown. But given Atlanta\u2019s current record (1-6), it appears trading away Sanu was the best option.\n\nSanu said his goodbyes to the team in a tweet after reports of the trade surfaced.\n\nSanu still has one year left on his contract. He is owed $3.5 million this season and $6.5 million next season and will become an unrestricted free agent in 2021, according to Spotrac.\n\nURBAN MEYER SPARKS SPECULATION ABOUT HIS INTEREST IN DALLAS COWBOYS HEAD COACHING JOB\n\nThe former Rutgers wide receiver spent his first four seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals before he joined the Falcons during the 2016 season. He\u2019s never had more than 70 receptions or 1,000 receiving yards in a season.\n\nNew England adds Sanu to a loaded corps that already includes Julian Edelman and Josh Gordon.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nThe Patriots are 7-0 this season after a Monday night thrashing of the New York Jets.", "description": "The New England Patriots reportedly acquired wide receiver Mohamed Sanu in a trade with the Atlanta Falcons on Tuesday in an effort to boost the weapons around Tom Brady.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
