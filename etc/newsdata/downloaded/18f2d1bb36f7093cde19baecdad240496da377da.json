By Wednesday last week, the offer was recut to attempt to lure reluctant investors to MPC\u2019s coal seam party. The price was dropped to $2.25 a share and the offer size trimmed to $149 million, with the vending shareholders' cash-out cut by nearly 50 per cent to just $89.4 million.\n\nBy Thursday, with interest apparently still uninspiring, SCF Partners and Viburnum put their business back on the shelf.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, it came down to one issue,\u201d Smith says. \u201cAnd you know, we must have visited about 45-plus investors. Each one, we got a good reception and feedback was good. But it came down to the issue of pricing and valuation.\n\n\u201cSo it is just a case where our current shareholders saw a lot of value in what we are doing today, the opportunity and the new areas we are working to. And we just couldn\u2019t get a price agreed between the buyers and sellers. We couldn\u2019t meet in the middle on something that worked.\n\n\u201cWhich is a shame, right? Because at the end of the day, it is a great business, it is unique, it is particular to a market and has good growth from a number of angles. But at the end of the day it came down to price. There was no other issue that was raised.\u201d\n\nSo, outside of any sense of slightly humiliating anti-climax, does it matter a whole lot that MPC is not going to get the $69 million that would have arrived with the primary raise?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was all about M &A\n\nThe new capital was to be dedicated to debt reduction first, followed by growth investment. If I am reading the deal presentation correctly, the IPO was also supposed to secure a new $50 million facility with the ANZ, with $10 million of that to be used for working capital and $40 million available for M &A.\n\n\u201cIt is not really an issue for the business day-to-day,\u201d Smith contends. \u201cA lot of that capital was to be used for M &A. We saw some opportunities in M &A, particularly around technology and digital management, that we would have liked to go after.\n\n\u201cWe have to sit down over the next week or two and rethink and reconsider how we are going to do that. In terms of basic business, life continues strongly. The business is solid, cash is solid. The issue is the capability immediately to go and do some M &A.\n\n\u201cThe great thing about SCF Partners is that this is all they do. They basically have invested in oil and gas service companies. They have a big portfolio of sister companies.\n\n\"So we will look at all sorts of ways of understanding where we can grow and what we can do. Who knows what that will entail in the future?\u201d\n\nWhat makes MPC so interesting to me is that it is has been custom-made for the unique experiment that is the export-scale development of coal seam gas resources.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is well understood anywhere,\u201d Smith agrees. \u201cThe whole 'CSG as the basis of an export product' makes sense. But it is unique. Nowhere in the world do you have CSG of this style producing LNG (liquid natural gas) for the export markets in the volume we do.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is special structural advantage in this for a new entrant like MSC. The new market is big enough to support its development but too small to attract similar nimbleness from majors.\n\n\u201cBecause CSG, unconventional gas is such a small market in international terms, the larger service companies have fantastic global solutions but we work hard to make it really particular for CSG customers,\u201d Smith says.\n\nCradle to the grave\n\nOutside of actually drilling the wells \u2013 a business judged too competitive and capital-intensive for MPC to secure advantage from \u2013 MPC offers a \u201ccradle to the grave\u201d service offering that continues to evolve in its breadth and CSG-specific technologies.\n\nMPC provides the networks of pipes and pumps that gather the gas from wells; it completes the wells that others drill, getting them production ready; it delivers and operates the gas processing facilities, runs the workovers so routinely necessary in unconventional petroleum production and, at the end of a well\u2019s life, it will plug and abandon it for its owner.\n\n\u201cThat really is our game,\u201d Smith says. \u201cOur game is really to look over the wall at the sort of large high-tech oil and gas \u2013 the deep water and ultra-deep water operators and the big guys in the Middle East \u2013 and then translate that to what they do in coal seam gas.\n\n\u201cCoal seam gas is shallow wells, low pressure, low temperature, but you need lots of them. So we provide efficient solutions and we are working to get some step-changes for our clients. What can we do, not just to reduce costs by 2 per cent. We look at that as normal business. But we then look at what else can we do.\u201d\n\nSmith offers a couple of examples where innovation has generated value for provider and customers. One has been to work out how to tap the capacity of water gathering systems to return water to wells as part of the workover process that aims to extend production peaks as long as possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn average CSG wells need to be worked over every two years or so. This is a growing business. There are currently about 6500 wells in the south-east Queensland inventory, and that number will grow by 1000 annually for the next 20 years or so.\n\nA workover requires water to be returned to the wells to both stop the flow of gas and revitalise fractures. It requires about 30 truckloads of water to make that happen and that accounts for maybe 20 per cent of the total cost of the workover. By tapping the capacity of the gathering systems, that cost and risk is avoided.\n\nMPC is currently working on innovation that avoids the need to \u201ckill\u201d a well as part of the workover process.\n\n\u201cThe problem of killing a gas well is when you unload it to bring it back it can take a long time, up to 60 days,\u201d Smith explains. \u201cBut the process we are working on now, we vacuum off the gas, which means the well keeps producing but we can go in and do the mechanical workover.\n\n\"Then you just re-plum it up at the end of it and you haven\u2019t lost that production and that, again, is a big saving for the operators.\u201d", "description": "The bespoke services provider to Australian coal seamers will review its growth options after finding that the price of a public listing was too high.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.4572%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/36d2ff22e6115aa613b0aa864cc94f454a3ada57", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
