She added: \u201cHowever, I no longer believe leaving with a deal is the government\u2019s main objective.\u201d\n\nWhile she could see the government was \u201cexpending a lot of energy\u201d preparing for no deal, she had not seen \u201cthe same level of intensity go into our talks with the European Union\u201d and updates from his office had \u201cnot, regretfully, provided me with the reassurances I sought\u201d.\n\nWho are the 21 Tory rebels and will an election now happen?

I cannot support this act of political vandalism.\u201d\n\nRudd\u2019s decision follows the resignation from the cabinet of Johnson\u2019s own brother, Jo Johnson, on Thursday and will place intense pressure on other cabinet members who are also against a no-deal Brexit, including Nicky Morgan, to follow suit.\n\nLabour\u2019s party chairman, Ian Lavery, said: \u201cThe prime minister has run out of authority in record time and his Brexit plan has been exposed as a sham. No one trusts Boris Johnson. Not his cabinet, not his MPs, not even his own brother.\u201d\n\nDavid Gauke, the pro-remain \u00adformer secretary of state for justice and lord chancellor, tweeted of Rudd\u2019s resignation: \u201cI\u2019m sure this has not been an easy decision. But it is brave and principled and is all about putting the national interest first.\u201d\n\nThe Sunday Times (@thesundaytimes) Exclusive: Amber Rudd @AmberRuddHR today announces that she is resigning from the cabinet and quitting the Conservative Party over Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cpurge\u201d of the party and his \u201cfailure\u201d to pursue a deal with the EU.\n\n\n\nRead the full story here: https://t.co/MsPibDGGR7 pic.twitter.com/iEQiIyYZlY\n\nA source close to the group of purged former MPs said: \u201cThe wheels are coming off the Dominic Cummings Downing Street machine. The sham negotiation has been exposed for what it is \u2013 and he has no plan B. He\u2019s single-handedly trying to turn the Conservative party into an extreme rightwing faction \u2013 and moderates are clearly not welcome.\u201d\n\nRudd\u2019s departure follows a desperate week for the new prime minister, during which a cross-party group of MPs seized control of the parliamentary timetable and succeeded in voting through a bill to block a no-deal Brexit, despite Johnson\u2019s insistence that he would not extend the deadline for leaving the EU beyond 31 October.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Page 1 of Amber Rudd\u2019s resignation letter. Photograph: Amber Rudd/PA\n\nOn Saturday the prime minister was warned that he would trigger a legal and constitutional crisis that would force his resignation if he failed to obey the legislation championed by the cross-party group, including Tory rebels, mandating him to seek another extension to Brexit.\n\nAccording to leaked legal advice from leading QCs sent to the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, the prime minister would be declared in contempt of court if he were to remain in No 10 while refusing to obey legislation to prevent the UK leaving the EU without a deal on 31 October. The new law is expected to gain royal assent from the Queen early this week.\n\nThe legal advice \u2013 from lawyers at Matrix Chambers \u2013 says: \u201cIf the prime minister refused to comply with this order then, while we would be in uncharted political territory, the legal position would remain clear \u2013 the prime minister would be in contempt of an order of the court and would be exposed to a full range of sanctions.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, as violence broke out near parliament as a pro-Brexit protest confronted a remain march, Downing Street said Johnson remained defiant.\n\nJohnson and his advisers are this weekend exploring further legislative possibilities, including the \u201cnuclear\u201d option of tabling a no-confidence motion in the government and ordering Tory MPs to vote for it, in order to trigger an election. Such a motion would require only a simple majority of MPs to pass, but may not be allowed by the Speaker, John Bercow.\n\nAnnouncing her decision on Twitter, Rudd said: \u201cI have resigned from cabinet and surrendered the Conservative whip. I cannot stand by as good, loyal, moderate Conservatives are expelled.\n\n\u201cI have spoken to the PM and my association chairman to explain. I remain committed to the one nation values that drew me into politics.\u201d\n\nRising Tory anger at Cummings' role in 'purge' of Brexit rebels Read more\n\nNick Boles, who quit the party in April after his soft Brexit plan failed, tweeted: \u201cEveryone has a point beyond which they cannot be pushed. Amber Rudd has reached hers. How much more of the party he inherited will Johnson destroy before he has second thoughts or is stopped by his cabinet colleagues?\n\n\u201cAt what point do Matt Hancock and Nicky Morgan suddenly discover that they too have backbones,\u201d he went on. \u201cOr are they now nailed on as the one nation window dressing for the Brexit party?\u201d\n\nStarmer tweeted: \u201cJohnson government falling apart. He\u2019s being totally found out.\u201d\n\nThe former home secretary was dogged by questions throughout the Tory leadership contest about whether she could serve in Johnson\u2019s cabinet if he won the race, given that his strategy would involve keeping no deal on the table during negotiations with Brussels.\n\nShe accepted the offer of continuing in her job as work and pensions secretary when Johnson formed his cabinet in July. Rudd has represented Hastings and Rye since 2010 and has one of the smallest majorities in the country, with only 346 votes separating her from her Labour rival in 2017.", "description": "Work and pensions secretary also leaves parliamentary Conservative party and sends excoriating letter to No 10", "authors": ["Michael Savage", "Daniel Boffey", "Andrew Rawnsley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90e6b01debd68787e90355ae1f01530f3308a1d8/0_153_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9ee519c0b2f07112bdfff337b283b8b4", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
