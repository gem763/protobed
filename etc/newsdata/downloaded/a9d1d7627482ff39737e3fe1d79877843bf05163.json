The law banning women was enforced after the Islamic Revolution in 1979.\n\nIran had subsequently agreed to sell tickets to women for Thursday's match in Tehran, but human rights campaigners said the gesture was a \"whitewash\".\n\nOpen Stadiums, a local movement of Iranian women, also hit out at footballing authorities, saying the match at the nation's 75,000 stadium will be half empty because the \"Iranian FA doesn't want to give more seats to women\".\n\nMore than 40 women have been arrested for attempting to enter football stadiums over the past two years, Amnesty said. Instead of selling a limited number of tickets, the charity has called on Iranian authorities to lift \"all restrictions on women attending football matches\".", "description": "Amnesty has accused Iran of staging a \"cynical publicity stunt\" by allowing a \"token\" 3,500 women into Thursday's international against Cambodia following a global outcry over a campaigner's death.", "authors": ["Tom Morgan", "Sports News Correspondent", "Luke Edwards", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/09/TELEMMGLPICT000209060418-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqx0cmEs-OEQHtEBu1pX5302sChmsCFBySEh8cd1MTtC8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
