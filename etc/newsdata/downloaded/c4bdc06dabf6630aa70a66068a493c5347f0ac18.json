Whether it be a luxury brand like Gucci selling a blackface sweater or a fast food company like Wendy\u2019s co-opting Black language and phrases, corporations aren\u2019t listening to the demographic with the second-largest spending power in the country.\n\nThat\u2019s proven by Nielsen\u2019s latest report, \u201cIt\u2019s in the Bag: Black Consumers\u2019 Path to Purchase.\u201d The report, released Thursday, highlights how media engagement, spending habits, lifestyle interests and more economic advancements have made Black people a key population that helps stimulate the U.S. economy.\n\n\u201cThis year, we wanted to help brands and marketers understand the multi-faceted process Blacks take to buy the products they buy,\u201d said Cheryl Grace, Nielsen\u2019s senior vice president of community alliances and consumer engagement and co-creator of the Diverse Intelligence Series Report, in a statement. \u201cThere are several drivers; but culture is at the center of them all. Further, with their love for technology, they are much more savvy and conscious consumers. They are, as we say, \u2018woke.\u2019 They pay attention to how companies are speaking to them. As they spend more, they want more for themselves and from the brands they support.\u201d\n\nNielsen\u2019s study shows Black Americans are more likely than the total population to agree that ads provide meaningful information. However, money spent on advertising to Black consumers decreased 5% between 2017 and 2018. There was a $7 million decline in investment to reach Black people via television despite the fact they are spending more time watching TV and streaming shows than the general public.\n\n\u201cRight now there is a grand total of about $18 billion of $84 billion overall being spent on advertising focused on African Americans through media. That\u2019s a decline from the year over a year,\u201d Grace said. \u201cWe\u2019re watching more, but brands are spending less to reach us. It\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nOther Space Original Series The Nielsen 2019 report on Black consumerism shows a decline in money spent on advertising to Black people from 2017 to 2018.\n\nGrace told HuffPost this is why it\u2019s vital to create programming and ads inclusive of Black people\u2019s voices. \u201cWhen you have a level playing field and you allow us to participate, we\u2019re gonna react and we\u2019re generally gonna do it a little bit larger than total population has allowed,\u201d she said. \u201cSo that niche content is really very critical.\u201d\n\nAlong with image and messaging, access and social awareness are also critical when it comes to Black consumerism. Forty-two percent of Black consumer adults expect the brands they consume to support social causes; that\u2019s 16% more than the general population. The study also noted that the availability of even more Black-owned brands affect the community\u2019s decisions on where to spend.\n\nAdditionally, with the exception of Facebook, Black people are also outpacing the U.S. general population when it comes to social media usage. While 66% of Black people use Facebook as opposed to 70% of the general population, 55% use Instagram compared to 46% of the general population, and 37% use Twitter compared to 33% of the general population. The power of Black people\u2019s presence on social media combined with the fact that consumers are more likely to buy what\u2019s recommended to them can either cause a product to soar, like Popeyes\u2019 chicken sandwich, or tank, like H&M\u2019s \u201cmonkey\u201d shirt.\n\nThe report also features guest commentary from Angela Rye that lays out questions Black consumers should ask before supporting a company: Was I able to find this product in my neighborhood? Does the brand make an effort to connect with me and reflect my community? Does the brand support causes I care about? Does the brand commit to representing my community in their ranks? Do I still want to do business with this brand if the answer to any of the aforementioned questions is no?\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take our everyday purchases for granted,\u201d Grace said at a press conference. \u201cAnd any of these large manufacturers or mass retailers where we\u2019re going to shop or we\u2019re making these decisions on where to buy, we as Blacks have to be responsible for deciding, \u2018How do I want to spend my money and do I want to spend it with brands that are paying attention to me?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery single dollar that you spend is benefiting somebody on the receiving end and you have everyday power to use your money wisely,\u201d she said.\n\nWe as Blacks have to be responsible for deciding, \u2018How do I want to spend my money and do I want to spend it with brands that are paying attention to me?\u2019 Cheryl Grace, co-creator of the Diverse Intelligence Series Report\n\nThe report points to the commercial successes of Rihanna\u2019s Fenty Beauty inclusive line of products and advertising, Procter & Gamble\u2019s \u201cThe Talk\u201d and \u201cThe Look\u201d ads, and Nike\u2019s campaign with Colin Kaepernick as examples of how brands can better represent Black people in advertising.\n\nThe report indirectly asks Black consumers: If companies aren\u2019t listening, then do they deserve your dollar? Black people currently have a spending power of $1.3 trillion, Nielsen reports, predicting that number to increase to $1.5 trillion by 2023.\n\nGrace said she talks to brands about the findings in these targeted reports and reminds them that it\u2019s not just enough to show Black people in ads; it also requires being inclusive and intentional when it comes to hiring and decision-making.\n\n\u201cI\u2019s important for them to make sure that they have people who are sitting in their offices who look like the consumers they\u2019re trying to reach and who have been empowered to speak up if they sense that a brand is going down the wrong path to avoid those kinds of tone-deaf ads,\u201d Grace said. \u201cAnd to ensure that [the] agencies they are doing business with are diverse and that the diversity of those agencies, that you\u2019ve got people who look like us and are being listened to at the agencies.\u201d\n\nRead the full report here.", "description": "The 2019 Nielsen report on Black consumerism shows that companies spent less on advertising to the African American community in 2018 than in 2017.", "authors": ["Black Voices Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7966ee3b00002a74d0f12f.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
