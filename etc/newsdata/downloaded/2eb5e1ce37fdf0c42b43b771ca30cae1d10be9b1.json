That could leave it liable for lease payments if it is unable to find tenants.\n\nWeWork had also faced questions about its complicated financial ties to Mr Neumann.\n\nLast week, Mr Neumann returned $5.9m worth of stock to the firm, which he had controversially received in exchange for his trademark of \"We\".\n\nSince WeWork's start in New York in 2010, it has expanded to more than 500 locations in 111 cities across 29 countries.\n\nThe growth has been costly. WeWork lost about $1.6bn last year, despite revenue nearly doubling.", "description": "The office space firm changes its structure after investor fears put its stock market debut in doubt.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/88EA/production/_104205053_wework_index_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
