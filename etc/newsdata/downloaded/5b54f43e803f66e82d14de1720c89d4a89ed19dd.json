In the press release it was stated \u201cThe company closed a private placement of 28,500 units at 10 cents per unit for a gross proceeds of $28,500.\u201d The 28,500 units is incorrect. Rather, it was 285,000 units. Therefore the correct statement should read, \u201cThe company closed a private placement of 285,000 units at 10 cents per unit for a gross proceeds of $28,500.\n\n\n\nThere are no clarifications to be made for the French version of the same October 3rd, 2019 press release.\n\nAbout Beauce Gold Fields\n\nBeauce Gold Fields is a gold exploration company focused on placer to hard rock exploration in the Beauce region of Southern Quebec. The Company\u2019s flagship property is the St-Simon-les-Mines Gold project, a unique, historically significant gold property located in the municipality of Saint-Simon-les-Mines. Comprising of a block of 152 claims as well as 7 real estate lots, the project area hosts a six kilometre long unconsolidated gold-bearing sedimentary unit (a lower saprolite and an upper brown diamictite). Textural observations (angularity) of gold nuggets suggest a relatively proximal source and therefore a short transport distance. The gold in saprolite indicates a close proximity to a bedrock source of gold, providing possible further exploration discoveries. The property was host to Canada\u2019s first gold rush before the one in the Yukon Klondike. It hosts some of the largest historical placer gold mines in Eastern North America that were active from 1860s to the 1960s (see HPQ SEDAR-filed July 4 2018 43-101 report).\n\nBeauce Gold Fields website www.beaucegold.com\n\nBGF Presentation: http://beaucegold.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/BGF-Presentation-20191.pdf\n\nDisclaimers:\n\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements containing the words \"may\", \"plan\", \"will\", \"estimate\", \"continue\", \"anticipate\", \"intend\", \"expect\", \"in the process\" and other similar expressions which constitute \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable securities laws.
