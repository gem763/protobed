A university spokeswoman, Angie Hunt, said Wednesday that she couldn\u2019t yet clarify how many people were injured, how many were taken to hospitals or say whether the fan who fell remained hospitalized. She also says the ongoing investigation prevents her from providing more details, including any names.\n\nMaury Ruble, of Ogden, told The Des Moines Register that he was sitting behind the man who fell. Ruble says he looked left at his wife and son for a moment after the man stood up. Ruble says that when he looked back the man had already fallen.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Des Moines Register, http://www.desmoinesregister.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Iowa State officials say they're still investigating the fall of a man onto other football fans below at Jack Trice Stadium.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
