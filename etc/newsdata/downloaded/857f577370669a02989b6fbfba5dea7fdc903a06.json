'You have dim lights, you have soft music. This is the complete opposite.'\n\nNew practice: Amanda Kauffman lead a rage yoga class in Kansas City, Missouri, at a brewery\n\nSomething new: The Monday class was the first one she taught and involved each participant getting a beer to drink during the workout\n\nLetting it out: Participants were also encouraged to yell profanities and make hand gestures\n\nIt was Amanda's first time teaching the rage yoga class for participants in Kansas City, but the structure first started in Canada.\n\nLindsay Istace, the founder of Rage Yoga, developed the class structure years back after she felt like she was in a 'library full of gymnasts' when attending regular yoga classes.\n\n'It's meant to be a different approach to yoga for those who find their peaceful center in a different way,' she told Health.com in an interview about the practice.\n\nNow Amanda, who has been practicing traditional yoga for seven years, is hoping to carry the class on in Kansas City after first stumbling upon the concept two years ago.\n\n'A lot of people stay away from yoga because they think, \"Oh well, you know, I\u2019m not good enough for that, or what are people going to think about my poses,\"' she said. 'And in here, you can just be yourself.'\n\nParticipants who attended the class were greeted at the door with a cup of beer to set next to their mat ahead of the exercise.\n\nInnovative: The yoga instructor learned the practice, which first developed in Canada, two years ago and decided to teach classes for others\n\nHaving fun: 'We\u2019ll be listening to loud explicit music, we will be cussing, using profanity, yelling, screaming, just letting all the negative energy out tonight,' Amanda said\n\nIncredible: The class gives off a more rock and roll type of experience with the inclusion of loud music and hand gestures\n\nThe beginning: Lindsay Istace, the founder of Rage Yoga , developed the class structure years back after she felt like she was in a 'library full of gymnasts' at regular yoga classes\n\nLoud music then vibrates through the speakers as attendees work through the different poses.\n\nAmanda encourages her class to go as far as yelling out obscenities and even flipping the bird when hitting specific poses during the exercise.\n\n'We\u2019ll be listening to loud explicit music, we will be cussing, using profanity, yelling, screaming, just letting all the negative energy out tonight. That\u2019s the goal,' Amanda said when describing the atmosphere of her class.\n\nTypically, Amanda confessed to practicing yoga to music that includes heavy metal and rock.\n\nRage yoga allowed for her to incorporate the genres into the practice instead of focusing on softer tones.\n\nOne participant, Hillary Luppino, told Fox 4 KC that the yoga class was different from what she normally practiced, but she enjoyed the experience overall.\n\n'Well first off I get a beer with it,' Hillary joked, adding she liked 'the idea of also kind of incorporating the stress release of like yelling or screaming or flipping somebody off.'\n\nAmanda intends to host more rage yoga classes in Kansas City.", "description": "Amanda Kauffman lead a rage yoga class in Kansas City, Missouri.
