REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo\n\nOn the second day of a three-day trip to Washington, Zuckerberg, wearing a suit and tie rather than his usual hoodie, met with Senators Josh Hawley and Mike Lee. He also had dinner with lawmakers, including Senator Richard Blumenthal, on Wednesday evening.\n\nZuckerberg took no questions from reporters as he moved from office to office on Capitol Hill.\n\nAfter his meeting with the Facebook founder, Hawley, a tough critic, said that discussions had been \u201cfrank,\u201d often a euphemism for disagreements. He told Zuckerberg that Facebook could show it was serious about protecting users\u2019 privacy by selling social media platforms that Facebook had acquired. This would restrict the company\u2019s ability to compile information about an individual from different sources.\n\n\u201cI said to him, \u2018Prove that you\u2019re serious about data. Sell WhatsApp. And sell Instagram,\u2019\u201d Hawley told reporters. \u201cSafe to say he was not receptive to those suggestions.\u201d\n\nHawley has accused Facebook of suppressing conservative speech. He was one of four senators who signed a letter this month accusing Facebook of censorship for declaring statements on the anti-abortion group Live Action\u2019s Facebook page false and temporarily restricting access to it as part of an effort to fight false news.\n\nHawley expressed exasperation with the CEO\u2019s acknowledgement that restricting access to the page had been an error.\n\n\u201cHe said that they made a mistake, that there was clearly bias in the Live Action decision,\u201d said Hawley, who urged Facebook to submit its content moderation process to an independent third-party audit. \u201cThe company talks a lot. I\u2019d like to see some action.\u201d\n\nThe CEO was expected to meet on Friday with House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, who has been an outspoken critic of what he has called bias at Facebook, as well as Adam Schiff, a Democrat and chair of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\nDINNER WITH SENATORS\n\nAnother critic has been Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat who attended a dinner with Zuckerberg on Wednesday at the Washington restaurant Ris.\n\nAfter the dinner, Blumenthal said he had brought up Facebook\u2019s \u201crepeated failures\u201d in election security and consumer privacy. \u201cWe had (a) serious, substantive conversation even when we may have differed,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nZuckerberg also met with Senators Mike Lee, Tom Cotton and Maria Cantwell, who is one of several lawmakers working to draft online privacy legislation.\n\nLee, who has more moderate views of the social media company, and Zuckerberg discussed bias on Facebook\u2019s platform, potential government regulation, antitrust and other issues, a spokesman said.\n\nZuckerberg was expected to hold meetings with the Trump administration, according to a person briefed on the matter. Facebook and the White House both declined to say if Zuckerberg would meet with President Donald Trump.\n\nFacebook has spent the last several years under fire for a string of lapses including inappropriately sharing information belonging to 87 million users with a now-defunct British political consultancy, triggering a $5 billion fine.\n\nThe company, which is an advertising powerhouse, faces antitrust investigations by the Federal Trade Commission and a number of state attorneys general, as well as numerous legislative proposals that seek to restrict how it operates.\n\nIt may also face an antitrust probe by the U.S. Justice Department. Senator Lee was critical of what he saw as duplication in federal investigations in a hearing on Tuesday.", "description": "Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has met with some of his company's toughest critics, facing aggressive questions over the social network's failures to protect consumer privacy and a call on Thursday to sell WhatsApp and Instagram.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431674431&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I1L6-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
