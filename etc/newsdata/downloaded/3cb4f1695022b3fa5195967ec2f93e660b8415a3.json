What they don't realise is that it will happen but when we do it, we need to do it right.\"\n\nBatohi said the patience of some South Africans was running thin. \"People don't want to hear me talk, they want to see action. Part of the strategy is not to talk too much but speak when we have something to say.\"\n\nBatohi took office in February after being selected through a transparent public process.\n\nShe said she often lamented to her staff that nothing seemed to have changed at the NPA since she left 10 years ago.\n\nBatohi added before she had accepted the position, she met with President Cyril Ramaphosa and insisted on an \"unequivocal\" commitment from the president of her independence as well as the NPA's.\n\n\"It's a commitment I will not waver from enforcing at any cost.\n\n\"Public confidence in the government and criminal justice institutions is at a dangerously low level, and we have a very small window of opportunity to turn this situation around before all credibility is lost.\n\n\"It is clear that corruption disables the ability of our government to deliver basic services and, in doing so, violates the human rights of the most vulnerable of our citizens,\" said Batohi.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
