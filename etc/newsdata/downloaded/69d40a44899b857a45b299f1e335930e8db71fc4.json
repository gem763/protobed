People\u2019s vote! When do we want it? Now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first referendum was jumping on a train without a destination,\u201d said Douglas Hill, 35, from Oxford, south central England, with his Estonian wife and their baby daughter.\n\n\u201cNow that we have a destination, we need to have a second referendum.\u201d\n\nAnother attendee, Theodor Howe, a 20-year-old student in Dundee, eastern Scotland, conceded another poll could be divisive but insisted it was still necessary.\n\n\u201cPeople should have a say in what is going to happen,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nThe mood was buoyant when news came through that MPs had voted to delay their decision on whether to accept the deal, although the prime minister vowed again he will not negotiate an extension beyond October 31.\n\nThe crowd broke into cheers and applause, with demonstrator Philip Dobson telling AFP: \u201cThat\u2019s really good, that\u2019s one step away from Brexit.\n\n\u201cIt could be that the government falls, who knows?\u201d\n\nThomas Lambert, a rare Brexit supporter wandering among the crowds, said he was \u201cgutted\u201d by the vote, adding: \u201cAnother delay is an abomination.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Last opportunity\u2019 \u2013\n\nPoliticians including John McDonnell, the main opposition Labour Party\u2019s finance spokesman, and London Mayor Sadiq Khan, were due to address the crowds.\n\nOrganisers from the People\u2019s Vote pressure group laid on 172 buses to bring demonstrators to the British capital, with the cost covered by supporters from sport, business and entertainment, it said.\n\nFormer prime ministers John Major, a Conservative, and Tony Blair, of Labour, feature in a film set to be broadcast to the crowds in Parliament Square.\n\n\u201cWhatever is the outcome, no deal or bad deal, it should not pass without the final say resting with the people,\u201d they said in a statement Friday.\n\nKhan was among those leading the crowd as it snaked its way towards parliament, which was holding its first Saturday sitting since the 1982 Falklands War as the British prime minister tried to win MPs\u2019 backing.\n\nThe protesters unveiled an effigy depicting Johnson as a puppet operated by his chief advisor Dominic Cummings \u2014 a highly divisive figure who masterminded the successful 2016 campaign to leave the EU.\n\n\u201cIt will be our last opportunity to have a final say,\u201d said Jane Golding, a lawyer working in Berlin.\n\n\u201cMost British abroad didn\u2019t have a say in the last referendum, most Europeans here didn\u2019t have it either. That wrong needs to be righted. Let us vote!\u201d\n\nA smaller counter-protest by Brexit supporters draped in the British flag was also staged in Westminster, with rival demonstrators verbally sparring with each other in the shadow in parliament.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Tens of thousands of pro-EU protesters from across Britain wielding banners, placards and flags converged on parliament Saturday,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/b0c047_thousands-protesters-are-calling-referendum-on-britain-eu-membership-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
