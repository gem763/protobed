She reportedly said she and her sister, Vicky, never felt jealous or overshadowed by Rambo, Nikita and Catharina - the three lions. \"No not really; he also loved me and my sister equally, if not more,\" she said.\n\nNetwerk24 reported that Van Biljon's entire family had gathered at the farm on Wednesday.\n\nREAD: Man killed in lion attack at game reserve outside Pretoria\n\nA memorial service will be held on Wednesday, August 28, at the Ewige Lig church in Montana, Pretoria, Van Biljon's son-in-law Jan van Wyk told the publication.\n\nFamily at peace\n\nVan Wyk told Netwerk24 that, while they were sad, the family was coping and had found peace.\n\nAccording to Pretoria News, Van Biljon and his family moved to Mahala View Lion Lodge in 1985, which was just a piece of open veld at the time.\n\nLeon van Biljon with his beloved lions.

This latest tragic incident once again highlights the serious human safety issues associated with these facilities. From open-source records, we have recorded that there have been over 40 incidents, with 13 of these fatal, in South African captive carnivore facilities since 1996.
