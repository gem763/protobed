The sides have not reached a tentative agreement that would end the strike, but progress has been made.\n\nGM declined to comment on the involvement of the No. 1 U.S. automaker's top two executives in the talks. A UAW spokesman declined to comment.\n\nThe UAW strike began on Sept. 16, with the union's members at GM seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of profit and protection of healthcare benefits. Other issues include the fate of plants GM has indicated could close, and the use of temporary workers.\n\nAfter GM angered the UAW negotiators last week by appealing directly to workers and revealing details of the Detroit automaker's latest offer, the sides have continued talking. The UAW made a counter offer to GM on Friday.\n\nGM shares were up 1.6% in morning trading on Tuesday.
