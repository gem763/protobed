He says it\u2019s about separation of church and state.", "language": "en", "text": "Barrett Fletcher strode into the room with a pasta strainer, ready to invoke his god.\n\nBy the time the Kenai Peninsula Borough Assembly \u2014 the local governing body for 25,000 square miles of Alaska \u2014 called Fletcher\u2019s name at its regular meeting Tuesday evening, the 67-year-old semi-retired handyman had made all necessary preparations. He\u2019d traded his work overalls for khakis and a salmon-pink button down. He\u2019d typed and printed his remarks in extra-large Comic Sans typeface on a single sheet of paper.\n\nHe\u2019d placed an upside-down spaghetti colander atop his head.\n\nFletcher tapped the microphone, took his seat and told the gathered lawmakers exactly who he was: \u201cI\u2019m Barrett Fletcher. I\u2019m the founding pastor of the First Lower Peninsula Congregation of Pastafarians.\"\n\nA member of the audience giggled. A man turned his back in protest. A woman behind Fletcher, keeping a determinedly straight face, raised and sipped her drink.\n\n\u201cI am called to invoke the power of the true inebriated creator of the universe, drunken tolerator of all the lesser and more recent gods,\u201d Fletcher said, peering down at his typed-out prayer. \u201cMay the Great Flying Spaghetti Monster rouse himself from his stupor and let his noodly appendages ground each assembly member in their seats.\u201d\n\n[In New Zealand, the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster is an approved religion. Here's its first wedding.]\n\nHis speech would go viral over the next 48 hours, spurring headlines around the world and thousands of likes, shares and joke-filled comments on social media. Fletcher, his friends and congregants \u2014 members of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, which worships a spaghetti-and-meatball god \u2014 reveled in the spotlight, amused at the attention suddenly bestowed on Homer, the tightknit Alaskan town of about 5,000 where the meeting took place.\n\nBut they knew more serious issues were at play: controversial questions over the proper separation of church and state in America that date to the country\u2019s founding and crop up regularly in court.\n\n\u201cI was there to defend the First Amendment,\u201d Fletcher told The Washington Post. \u201cI\u2019m very offended by having God associated with my local politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no need to invoke the almighty before a meeting of the borough assembly,\u201d said Ken Landfield, another local. \u201cSo this is Barrett\u2019s answer, and I fully support it.\u201d\n\nFletcher\u2019s delivery of the Pastafarian invocation Tuesday marked the culmination of a years-long legal battle over the Kenai Peninsula Borough Assembly\u2019s habit of holding religious invocations before its meetings. The fight started in 2016 when the borough assembly approved a policy mandating that anyone who delivered religious invocations before its meetings must belong to an established organization that met regularly in the region. In practice, the governing body leaned on the new rule to prevent a Jewish woman and an atheist from delivering invocations, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThose denials prompted allegations of religious discrimination and, eventually, a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union of Alaska \u2014 litigation that wrapped up last October when the Alaska Supreme Court ruled the policy illegal under the state constitution\u2019s establishment clause. Like the federal version, Alaska\u2019s establishment clause prohibits government from establishing an official religion and from preferring one religion over another.\n\n[Sorry, Dutch Pastafarians, but you still can't wear a colander on your government ID... yet]\n\nIn his final decision, Judge Andrew Peterson wrote that the invocation rule \u201cstemmed from intolerance\u201d given it was crafted to \u201cexclude minority faiths or beliefs.\u201d\n\nBorough assembly members did not respond to requests for comment or were unable to comment Thursday \u2014 except for Dale Bagley, who emailed a brief summary of the controversy. \u201cWe lost a lawsuit and basically the Kenai Peninsula Borough has to allow anyone that wants to give an invocation to give it,\" Bagley wrote.\n\nHe added of Fletcher: \u201cWe didn\u2019t invite him.\u201d\n\nZeba Huq, a lecturer at Stanford Law School, said the Alaska case is broadly representative of a debate over religion\u2019s role in government that often roils U.S. courts and society. The country remains spread across a spectrum of legal views, she said: On one end, some attorneys point to the establishment clause to assert church and state must remain completely separate. Others take the opposite view, arguing anything short of \u201can official state religion\u201d is permissible, she said.\n\nIn the middle are those who say it\u2019s okay to mix religion with government \u2014 as long as all religions are treated equally. That\u2019s about the angle the Alaska Supreme Court appears to have taken, Huq said.\n\n\u201cThese are hard issues,\u201d Huq said. \u201cThere\u2019s no consensus; that\u2019s why these cases come to court and why religious liberty is such a contested issue in this country.\u201d\n\nFletcher, though, is clear what he wants: total separation of church and state. That creed is partly what drew him to Pastafarianism, he said.\n\nOregon resident Bobby Henderson created the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster in 2005 as a tongue-in-cheek religion partly meant to mock organized belief, particularly Christianity. In the years since, hundreds of thousands of people around the world have signed up, according to Mike Arthur, an indie filmmaker who is producing a documentary about Pastafarians.\n\n[Wisconsin recognizes the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster]\n\nJoining the faith is easy: People become Pastafarian by saying so, Arthur said. One can also purchase a roughly $25 certificate online to become a \u201cministeroni.\" Religious requirements are nonexistent \u2014 though some Pastafarians do meet up regularly to drink and eat pasta at \u201cservices,\" according to Arthur \u2014 and faith-based attire includes the infamous pasta strainer as a form of headgear.\n\nPastafarians have different interpretations, but for some the colander symbolizes a desire to \u201cseparate the important stuff, the pasta, from the non-important stuff, the water\u201d \u2014 in cooking and in life, Arthur said.\n\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s funny and it\u2019s satire, but it\u2019s deeper than that: What Pastafarians want is equality, and they want empathy,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cThey\u2019re not against religion \u2014 they\u2019re against nonsense done in the name of religion, or religion mixing with science or government.\u201d\n\nIn that sense, Fletcher\u2019s speech Tuesday is a perfect manifestation of the Pastafarian ethos, Arthur said.\n\nFletcher, who\u2019s been interested in Pastafarianism since 2005, said he became a \u201cministeroni\u201d and founded his congregation about three years ago specifically to oppose the borough assembly\u2019s invocation policy. After advertising his church on social media and through word of mouth, Fletcher attracted a devoted congregation of about 30, he said.\n\nHis ultimate goal was always to deliver an invocation before the borough assembly. On Tuesday, he used the long-sought opportunity to make his disdain clear.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gathered here to do the business of our Kenai Peninsula Borough, to make the rules of behavior and property, levy taxes and determine how to disburse them wisely,\" he said. \u201cA few of the assembly members seem to feel that they can\u2019t do this work without being overseen by a higher authority.\u201d\n\nFletcher concluded with a resounding \u201cRamen\" \u2014 and, at the meeting\u2019s close, went to a dinner party at a friend\u2019s house.\n\nHe removed the colander before the meal.", "description": "\u201cI\u2019m very offended by having God associated with my local politics,\u201d Barrett Fletcher, the pastor, said.", "authors": ["Hannah Natanson", "Reporter Covering Social Issues In The D.C.
