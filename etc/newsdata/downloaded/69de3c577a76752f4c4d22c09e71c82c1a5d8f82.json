I would have liked to give Jorginho and Kovacic a rest tonight for what they\u2019ve put in, for their physical output. But I couldn\u2019t because N\u2019Golo, Ross, Ruben\u2026I couldn\u2019t make those changes today and that what it is.\u2019\n\nLampard made six changes to his starting line-up for the defeat to United and his side looked rusty in the first half.\n\nThough they improved dramatically after the interval, they were sent crashing out after Rashford\u2019s fantastic free-kick.\n\nBut Lampard insists he has no regrets about the amount of changes he made and he insists he had little option.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve had seven wins on the trot and taxing games,\u2019 said Lampard.\n\n\u2018I think it\u2019s quite clear the league and Champions League are our priorities. Today I had to look at my squad and players who deserve minutes.\n\n\u2018This competition has an element of that for us. I saw a lot of things that are good for our future. I hate losing but it\u2019s clear there\u2019s a big picture and big games for us to come. Now we just move on, focus on what\u2019s in front.\u2019\n\nMORE: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer reacts to Manchester United knocking out Chelsea and Marcus Rashford wondergoal", "description": "Frank Lampard has revealed N'Golo Kante is set to return to training this week as he steps up his recovery from a groin strain.
