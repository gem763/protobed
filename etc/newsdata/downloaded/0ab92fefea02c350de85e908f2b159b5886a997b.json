It shows the government that it can\u2019t easily silence us,\u201d said a game developer surnamed Yung, who lives in Tuen Mun and works in Quarry Bay.\n\nThe march in North Point.

The movement has grown to take aim at a wider list of grievances, including anger at the police\u2019s response to earlier unrest.\n\nFriday\u2019s marchers, many wearing black masks with their suits, chanted slogans as they walked peacefully on pedestrian lanes, some grocers and newspaper vendors along the way cheering them on as they passed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve shut up shop a few times because of protests and MTR closures. Our business is being hit but we\u2019re in for the fight,\u201d said a shopkeeper in Tin Hau who gave her name as Li.\n\nAcross the harbour, also from 8am, about 200 people wearing masks chanted slogans as they marched the 2km from Kowloon Bay MTR station to Kwun Tong.\n\nIt\u2019s good that this walk to work is taking off in multiple districts. We need to remind citizens that the movement continues and we need to keep on fighting\n\nCarol Ip, customer service worker\n\nA band of about 50 people marching in the opposite direction high-fived the other group as they passed.\n\nCarol Ip, who is in her 30s and works in customer service in the trading industry, does not live nearby. But she said she got off her bus a stop early, near Ngau Tau Kok MTR station to join the walk to Kwun Tong. She said she wanted to keep the movement alive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that this walk to work is taking off in multiple districts. We need to remind citizens that the movement continues and we need to keep on fighting,\u201d she said.\n\nMost of the marchers dispersed at about 8.45am as they reached the APM mall near Kwun Tong MTR station.\n\nOutside Tsim Sha Tsui station near Kowloon Mosque, dozens walked up Nathan Road towards Mong Kok station while about 70 walked from Mong Kok to Yau Ma Tei.\n\nIn the event group on messaging platform Telegram, which protesters use regularly, a user who joined the protest in Kwun Tong said he was very touched by the event.\n\n\u201cSo many people were wearing masks today,\u201d he said. \u201cAlong the way, people were cheering each other. Some cars honked to show their support.\u201d\n\nSome users suggested making the march a regular thing.\n\nThis article Hongkongers turn their morning commutes into protest marches with Walk to Work event across districts first appeared on South China Morning Post\n\nFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2019.", "description": "Hundreds of residents across Hong Kong found a new way to rally against the government on Friday, ditching their regular early-morning commutes to join protest marches to work.The first-ever Walk to Work event encouraged people to march together to their places of work from 8am, starting at eight MTR", "authors": ["Kathleen Magramo"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ov_ivP0N2mKzL3hQ7TBOzg--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/south_china_morning_post_621/992ca7d6400713bfe02a6b9260eb5a7c", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
