Attending it are guests from a dozen countries and regions.\n\nZeng said decoupling will benefit neither oneself nor others from the macro-economic perspective. It is evident that decoupling will extremely damage the interests of businesses and consumers. According to Peterson Institute for International Economics, a tariff hike of 25 percent on all Chinese exports to the US will lead to additional expenses of around US$2,000 for every American household annually.\n\nIn trade, decoupling will lead to manmade breakdown of the global value chain, he said.", "description": "The so-called \"decoupling\" of the United States with China will not only bring disaster to the two countries but to the rest of the world, according to speakers at an international conference in Singapore, who said the two countries should forge common causes for global development.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/30/5db97adfa310cf3e97a3977f.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
