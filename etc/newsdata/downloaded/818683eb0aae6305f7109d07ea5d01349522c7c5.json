Similar arguments have been soundly and repeatedly rejected by the Supreme Court and other federal judges, he ruled.\n\n\"The notion of ... presidential immunity from judicial process that the President here invokes, unqualified and boundless in its reach described above, cuts against the grain of these Constitutional precedents,\" wrote Marrero, an appointee of President Bill Clinton in 1999.\n\nTrump\u2019s private legal team immediately filed an \u201cemergency appeal\u201d of the decision to the 2 nd Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan. And the appeals court quickly issued a temporary stay of Marrero's ruling while proceedings are pending.\n\nThe 2nd Circuit\u2019s brief order indicated a three-judge panel would conduct \u201cexpedited review\u201d of whether a stay pending the outcome of the appeal is appropriate.\n\n\"The Radical Left Democrats have failed on all fronts, so now they are pushing local New York City and State Democrat prosecutors to go get President Trump,\" Trump tweeted shortly after the ruling landed. \"A thing like this has never happened to any President before. Not even close!\"\n\nTrump and his attorneys have argued that the subpoena for records, issued by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., is politically motivated and could impinge on Trump's ability to carry out his presidential responsibilities. They have sought relief from the federal courts, arguing that New York state courts would not be a fair or proper venue.\n\nBut Marrero rejected the notion that any evidence suggests Vance Jr.'s subpoena was issued in \"bad faith\" or that New York courts would now be equipped to adjudicate the president's challenge.\n\nMarrero's most dramatic conclusion, however, may be his charged swipe at the Justice Department's legal guidance that a president cannot be indicted while in office.\n\n\"The court is not persuaded that it should accord weight and legal force the president ascribes to the DOJ memos,\" Marrero wrote.\n\nHe noted that the argument a sitting president cannot be indicted often relies entirely on these memos, which don't carry the force of law or legal precedent.\n\n\"[T]he theory has gained a certain degree of axiomatic acceptance ... as though their conclusion were inscribed on constitutional tablets so-etched by the Supreme Court,\" he said.\n\nRather, Marrero said a better balance might be struck between protecting legitimate presidential interests and ensuring justice can be served \u2014 either to the president or potential accomplices who would otherwise be shielded from prosecution. He also noted that the DOJ memos only speak to federal prosecution \u2014 not state or local.\n\nMarrero's comments on the DOJ memos \u2014 which have been a feature of Trump's legal arguments against investigations into him, his company and his associates \u2014 are some of the first made by a federal judge. And he notes that the memos based on hypothetical circumstances and \"hyperbolic horrors\" conjured by DOJ lawyers.\n\n\"In fact, not every criminal proceeding to which a President may be subjected would raise the grim specters the DOJ memos portray as incapacitation of the president,\" he argues.\"\n\nMarrero also noted that during the Watergate controversy, President Richard Nixon did not assert complete immunity from subpoenas, despite his claims that his Oval Office tapes and other records were subject to executive privilege.\n\nThe judge also noted that the suit was filed by Trump\u2019s personal lawyers, not the Justice Department \u2014 a fact he suggested might undermine Trump\u2019s claims that complying with the subpoena could impact his official duties. (The Justice Department did weigh in with a brief last week, supporting the Trump legal team\u2019s position.)\n\n\u201cHis arguments depend on his status as the sitting president,\u201d Marrero wrote in a footnote. \u201cWhether privately-retained, non-government attorneys accountable only to the President as an individual are entitled to invoke an immunity allegedly derived from the office of the Presidency, raises questions not addressed here,\u201d the judge added, saying the issue was \u201cunnecessary\u201d to resolve given his finding that the Trump team\u2019s arguments were lacking.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/05/96/8e2bbc0e481886b4e9ba079dad09/191007-trump-wh-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
