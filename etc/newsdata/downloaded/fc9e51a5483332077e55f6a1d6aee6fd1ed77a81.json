It also speaks to the complexity of the US drug-pricing system.\n\nThe filing shows that Purdue Pharma owes a lot of money to healthcare giants like CVS's Caremark unit and UnitedHealth Group's OptumRx unit, to the tune of $19.3 million and $15.8 million, respectively.\n\nPurdue also owes significant amounts to the Defense Health Agency, which supports medical services for the US Army, Navy, and Air Force, and to health departments for states like California, North Carolina, and Wisconsin.\n\nMuch of the money that Purdue owes are refunds called \"rebates,\" which are negotiated with drug companies on prescription medications in return for health insurers covering the drugs.\n\nHow drug rebates work\n\nRead more: Purdue Pharma, the drugmaker behind OxyContin, files for bankruptcy as part of a major settlement\n\nThe process works something like this: You, a patient, go into the pharmacy and pick up a prescription for a Purdue Pharma drug. Purdue gets paid and returns the refund for that drug back to a middleman, like CVS's Caremark unit, usually between three and nine months later, Michael Rea, the founder and CEO of Rx Savings Solutions, said.\n\nThis system has been accused of driving prices up for the patient, and it has recently come under attack by the Trump administration.\n\nBut for any further insight into how much Purdue gets paid for its drugs, you would need to know more about those private contracts, like the length of the time period before a rebate gets returned and how large the rebate is as a percentage of the drug's price, Rea said. Those aspects are not disclosed in the Purdue bankruptcy filing.\n\n\"Those details are going to frame how much are we actually talking about,\" Rea said.\n\n\"I think people are very curious about what price they see when they get to the counter of their corner pharmacy. And this helps them understand, these are some of the variables that can affect that price.\"\n\nRead more: Purdue Pharma and its billionaire owners may end up giving billions in OxyContin profits to communities harmed by the opioid crisis\n\nDrug distributors are owed money too\n\nOther top unsecured claims against Purdue are from drug distributors like AmerisourceBergen ($4.5 million), McKesson Corp. ($3.7 million), and Cardinal Health ($3.5 million). As the name might suggest, distributors get drugs to places like pharmacies and hospitals.\n\nIn addition to the prescription opioids OxyContin, Hysingla, and Butrans, Purdue also sells over-the-counter products like laxatives and dietary supplements.\n\nThe Purdue Pharma bankruptcy document, which was filed in the Southern District of New York, lists out the 50 largest unsecured claims against the company. In addition to rebates and distributor fees, they also include claims for services fees and \"trade debt\" from research companies and more. The claims are not listed as disputed on the filing.", "description": "Purdue Pharma owes millions to the pharmacy chain CVS, the health insurer UnitedHealth, and state health departments.", "authors": ["Emma Court"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d827abb2e22af70587c0048-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
