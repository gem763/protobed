He chose not to", "language": "en", "text": "Once again, the Commander-in-Chief turned to his favorite method of communication to spew vitriol and blasphemy today, this time comparing himself to the victims of racial violence and racial terrorism in this country by calling the impeachment inquiry a \u201clynching\u201d.\n\nPresident Trump clearly doesn\u2019t understand what a lynching is, or he wouldn\u2019t have used the term. Senator Lindsey Graham doesn\u2019t understand what one is, either, or he wouldn\u2019t have agreed with him.\n\nOf course, Twitter exploded. The hashtag \u201clynching\u201d has been trending all day and people from across the political spectrum have professed their horror at the president\u2019s latest show of racial provocation.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nResponding to the president\u2019s incendiary comments, Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris said, \u201cLynching is a reprehensible stain on this nation's history, as is this President. We'll never erase the pain and trauma of lynching, and to invoke that torture to whitewash your own corruption is disgraceful.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s right. Between 1877 and 1950, more than 4,400 black people were lynched in America, including women and children. The lynchings mostly happened in the Jim Crow south, where segregation and disenfranchisement laws provided the framework for codified laws of racial apartheid that dominated this country for nearly a century beginning in the 1890\u2019s.\n\nTrump\u2019s cleanup team quickly took to the media to try and undo his comments, arguing that he has done a lot for black people and that the problem wasn\u2019t what he said, rather than the media not liking how he says it. Needless to say, it was unconvincing.\n\nI spoke with Dr Koritha Mitchell, an associate professor in the Department of English at Ohio State University, who studies lynching in this America, when I heard of the president\u2019s remarks. She told me: \u201cWhen I read the tweet what I found astonishing was the pattern of appropriating civil rights language for sinister means. This idea that the media doesn\u2019t like the language and that\u2019s all is ludicrous. Racial violence in this country is never based on ignorance. They\u2019re not ignorant about what will be painful \u2013 that\u2019s why they use that specific language. So, suggesting that it\u2019s not on purpose is ridiculous. That\u2019s how racial aggression works: \u2018I can always remind you of your proper place\u2019. It\u2019s about terror and intimidation, or even just \u2018know your place\u2019. This casual way of how he offends everybody is a reminder that, as a straight white man, he has a license to do that. Lynching is the foundation of the political system we have right now and all you can do is feel outraged because there won\u2019t be any real ramifications for his words.\u201d\n\nRacial terrorism is a major issue in this country today. In July, three University of Mississippi students posed with guns in front of a bullet-riddled sign honoring civil rights icon Emmett Till, who was abducted, tortured and murdered in 1955 at the age of 14. In May 2017, Lieutenant Richard Collins III was stabbed and murdered in a racially motivated hate crime while waiting for an Uber on the University of Maryland Campus.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

He also believes that Hillary Clinton\u2019s deleted emails - a key factor in the 2016 election - may be in Ukraine, although it is not clear why.

Attorney Mark Zaid said that he and other lawyers on his team are now representing the second person, who is said to work in the intelligence community and has first-hand knowledge that supports claims made by the first whistleblower and has spoken to the intelligence community's inspector general. The second whistleblower has not yet filed their own complaint, but does not need to to be considered an official whistleblower. Getty 4/19 Rudy Giuliani Former mayor of New York, whose management of the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001 won him worldwide praise. As Trump\u2019s personal attorney he has been trying to find compromising material about the president\u2019s enemies in Ukraine in what some have termed a \u201cshadow\u201d foreign policy. In a series of eccentric TV appearances he has claimed that the US state department asked him to get involved. Giuliani insists that he is fighting corruption on Trump\u2019s behalf and has called himself a \u201chero\u201d. AP 5/19 Volodymyr Zelensky The newly elected Ukrainian president - a former comic actor best known for playing a man who becomes president by accident - is seen frantically agreeing with Trump in the partial transcript of their July phone call released by the White House. With a Russian-backed insurgency in the east of his country, and the Crimea region seized by Vladimir Putin in 2014, Zelensky will have been eager to please his American counterpart, who had suspended vital military aid before their phone conversation. He says there was no pressure on him from Trump to do him the \u201cfavour\u201d he was asked for. Zelensky appeared at an awkward press conference with Trump in New York during the United Nations general assembly, looking particularly uncomfortable when the American suggested he take part in talks with Putin. AFP/Getty 6/19 Mike Pence The vice-president was not on the controversial July call to the Ukrainian president but did get a read-out later. However, Trump announced that Pence had had \u201cone or two\u201d phone conversations of a similar nature, dragging him into the crisis. Pence himself denies any knowledge of any wrongdoing and has insisted that there is no issue with Trump\u2019s actions. It has been speculated that Trump involved Pence as an insurance policy - if both are removed from power the presidency would go to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, something no Republican would allow. AP 7/19 Rick Perry Trump reportedly told a meeting of Republicans that he made the controversial call to the Ukrainian president at the urging of his own energy secretary, Rick Perry, and that he didn\u2019t even want to. The president apparently said that Perry wanted him to talk about liquefied natural gas - although there is no mention of it in the partial transcript of the phone call released by the White House. It is thought that Perry will step down from his role at the end of the year. Getty 8/19 Joe Biden The former vice-president is one of the frontrunners to win the Democratic nomination, which would make him Trump\u2019s opponent in the 2020 election. Trump says that Biden pressured Ukraine to sack a prosecutor who was investigating an energy company that Biden\u2019s son Hunter was on the board of, refusing to release US aid until this was done. However, pressure to fire the prosecutor came on a wide front from western countries. It is also believed that the investigation into the company, Burisma, had long been dormant. Reuters 9/19 Hunter Biden Joe Biden\u2019s son has been accused of corruption by the president because of his business dealings in Ukraine and China. However, Trump has yet to produce any evidence of corruption and Biden\u2019s lawyer insists he has done nothing wrong. AP 10/19 William Barr The attorney-general, who proved his loyalty to Trump with his handling of the Mueller report, was mentioned in the Ukraine call as someone president Volodymyr Zelensky should talk to about following up Trump\u2019s preoccupations with the Biden\u2019s and the Clinton emails. Nancy Pelosi has accused Barr of being part of a \u201ccover-up of a cover-up\u201d. AP 11/19 Mike Pompeo The secretary of state initially implied he knew little about the Ukraine phone call - but it later emerged that he was listening in at the time. He has since suggested that asking foreign leaders for favours is simply how international politics works. AFP via Getty 12/19 Nancy Pelosi The Democratic Speaker of the House had long resisted calls from within her own party to back a formal impeachment process against the president, apparently fearing a backlash from voters. On September 24, amid reports of the Ukraine call and the day before the White House released a partial transcript of it, she relented and announced an inquiry, saying: \u201cThe president must be held accountable. No one is above the law.\u201d Getty 13/19 Adam Schiff Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, one of the three committees leading the inquiry. He was criticized by Republicans for giving what he called a \u201cparody\u201d of the Ukraine phone call during a hearing, with Trump and others saying he had been pretending that his damning characterisation was a verbatim reading of the phone call. He has also been criticised for claiming that his committee had had no contact with the whistleblower, only for it to emerge that the intelligence agent had contacted a staff member on the committee for guidance before filing the complaint. The Washington Post awarded Schiff a \u201cfour Pinocchios\u201d rating, its worst rating for a dishonest statement. Reuters 14/19 Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman Florida-based businessmen and Republican donors Lev Parnas (pictured with Rudy Giuliani) and Igor Fruman were arrested on suspicion of campaign finance violations at Dulles International Airport near Washington DC on 9 October. Separately the Associated Press has reported that they were both involved in efforts to replace the management of Ukraine's gas company, Naftogaz, with new bosses who would steer lucrative contracts towards companies controlled by Trump allies. There is no suggestion of any criminal activity in these efforts.

A moment when one commits an error, but the error gives rise to the opportunity to learn from the mistake, to reassess. In an ideal world, Trump and his acolytes would pay a visit to Alabama to learn about what lynching in America truly was and how the thousands of lynchings of black people continue to affect the lives of Americans and the political system of this country in 2019. They could visit the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Alabama, where over 800 steel monuments represent each county in the United States where a racial terror lynching happened. The names of the victims are engraved on the columns. Trump would be moved to tears and repent from his legacy of hatred and divisiveness \u2013 he would change course on domestic and foreign policy, quit taunting his political opponents with anti-Semitic insults like \u201cshifty Shiff\u201d and embrace religious, ethnic and political diversity.\n\nBut that is not the man we have in the White House.
