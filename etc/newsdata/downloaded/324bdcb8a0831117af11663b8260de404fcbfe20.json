Uber made the offer in a draft bill that has yet to be introduced in the California legislature, as an alternative to Assembly Bill 5, which is expected to pass this week. Assembly Bill 5 would require companies like Uber, Lyft and DoorDash to give drivers a minimum wage and unemployment benefits.\n\nUber\u2019s bill says it would call workers \u201cnetwork drivers,\u201d and guarantee weekly pay that\u2019s at least 1.27 times the minimum wage in the city where they\u2019re working. They\u2019d also get 30 cents per mile for car expenses. The pay and mileage would be calculated from the time a driver accepts a ride or delivery until it\u2019s complete, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nSo an hourly wage would be $19.80 per hour in San Francisco where the minimum wage is $15.59. Tips, cleaning fees and tolls would not count towards hourly pay, according to the proposed bill. Drivers would also get reimbursed 30 cents a mile, just above more than half the IRS mileage reimbursement rate of 58 cents per mile.\n\nRide-hailing apps would also pay up to 4% of local minimum wage per driver hour worked to a Drivers Benefits Fund that would buy occupational accident insurance or workers compensation insurance to \u201cpromote the safety and well-being of network drivers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew York City, USA - March 5, 2016: Uber car service with sign in car window is waiting to pickup passengers on 5th Avenue in Manhattan, NY.\n\nThe bill also says it will establish a Driver Advocate Program to give drivers a voice and say in the companies' safety, worker protections, benefits and wages.\n\nWith Assembly Bill 5 being considered Friday, the passage of Uber\u2019s bill seems unlikely, critics said. AB5 would reverse Uber\u2019s business model of hiring freelance employees on a contract basis. Experts say labor costs could rise 30% if the bill passes, and drivers could lose the flexibility to work whenever they want.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nUber did not immediately return a FOX Business request for comment.", "description": "Uber is proposing a bill that would pay workers more but maintain their employment status as independent contractors.", "authors": ["Jeanette Settembre"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/05/0/0/uber.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
