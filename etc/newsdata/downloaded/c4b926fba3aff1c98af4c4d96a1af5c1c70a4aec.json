He had already killed his 18-year-old friend Tricia Pacaccio in 1993 in Illionois, prosecutors say, but is yet to face trial over that death.\n\nHollywood Ripper Michael Gargiulo is facing execution after prosecutors called for the death penalty following his conviction for the murders of Ashton Kutcher's then-girlfriend and a mom-of-four he stabbed to death. He is pictured in court Monday\n\nGargiulo stabbed Ashley Ellerin, left, to death at her Hollywood home at age 22 in 2001. He killed 32-year-old Maria Bruno, right, at her home in El Monte in 2005\n\nOn Monday Deputy District Attorney Dan Akemon said Gargiulo 'has led a life of crime and violence that has left a swath of death, grief and destruction behind him'.\n\nHe added: 'He has earned and deserves the maximum penalty of death.'\n\nAshley Ellerin's mother Cynthia told the court: 'I ache for her. I ache to hold her. I ache to hear her voice, to hug her. But that's not going to happen.\n\n'I'm just empty without her. I'm sick to my stomach because she was mutilated to death.'\n\nA jury in downtown Los Angeles must decide whether to recommend the 43-year-old should be sentenced to death or spend the rest of his life in prison, without the possibility of parole\n\nShe recalled falling to her knees on the floor and 'crawling' around the bedroom on her 'hands and knees like an animal' on hearing the news of Ashley's death.\n\nGargiulo was charged with the murder of 22-year-old Ashley Ellerin in her Hollywood home in 2001 on a night when she was supposed to have drinks with Kutcher.\n\nEllerin had been stabbed so brutally that her head was almost completely severed.\n\nKutcher, who in 2001 was a rising star of 'That '70s Show' but not yet the household name he would become a few years later, testified early in the trial that he and Ellerin were just getting to know each other and had made plans to go out together for drinks.\n\nThey last spoke at 8.24pm when Kutcher testified that he told Ellerin he was running late and she told him she had just gotten out of the shower.\n\nKutcher said he arrived at her Hollywood home very late and got no answer when he knocked on the door.\n\nHe testified that he looked inside and saw what he thought were wine stains. He said he left thinking she had gone out without him in frustration.\n\n'I remember the next day, after I heard about what happened, I went to the detectives and said, 'My fingerprints are on the door,'' Kutcher said.\n\n'I was freaking out.'\n\nAshley's father Michael said Monday: 'The loss you go through (lasts) the rest of your life. Losing a child, it's not meant to be that way. The loss is profound. It broke my wife and my son.'\n\nAnother woman testified how Gargiulo had raped her when he was living in Illinois in 1995. She said: 'I was terrified. I didn't even want to move. I was petrified.'\n\nKutcher, who in 2001 was a rising star of 'That '70s Show' but not yet the household name he would become a few years later, testified early in the trial that he and Ellerin were just getting to know each other and had made plans to go out together for drinks\n\nGargiulo could now face the death penalty if he is found to have been sane at the time of his crimes.

Gargiulo, head shaven and wearing glasses, remained emotionless Monday as the parents of his victims broke down in tears as they described losing their loved ones in such horrific circumstances\n\nHe was also charged with the 2008 attempted murder of Michelle Murphy in her Santa Monica apartment.\n\nMurphy fought off her attacker and caused him to cut himself and leave a trail of blood, which set off the chain of events that led to the arrest and charges against Gargiulo.\n\nMurphy was a fitness buff who fought off the much larger Gargiulo in 2008 and caused him to cut himself, leaving a trail of blood as he fled.\n\nThe physical evidence against him was so overwhelming that defense attorneys conceded that it was him.\n\nThey offered as their only defense that he suffers from split personalities and did not know he was in Murphy's apartment. They noted that he said 'sorry' as he fled.\n\nProsecutors praised Murphy during their closing arguments, saying her resistance against Gargiulo led to his arrest in all of the other cases as they grew increasingly cold.\n\n'Michelle Murphy, because of her strength and courage, allowed investigators to work backwards,' the prosecutor said.\n\n'This case begins and ends with Michelle Murphy.'\n\nGargiulo is currently awaiting trial in Illinois for the 1993 killing of Tricia Pacaccio when he was 17 and friends with her younger brother\n\nThe killer has since been linked to the murder of a third woman. He is currently awaiting trial in Illinois for the 1993 killing of Tricia Pacaccio when he was 17 and friends with Pacaccio's younger brother.\n\nProsecutors were allowed to present evidence of the case in his California trial to help establish a pattern between the killings.\n\nPacaccio's father found her fatally stabbed on their family's doorstep with her house key still in hand.\n\nGargiulo was a close friend of Pacaccio's brother and detectives had long suspected him in the killing.\n\nBut they could never put together enough evidence to charge him with Pacaccio's murder - until the attack on Murphy 15 years later.\n\nTricia's mom Diane said: 'It's been 26 years. Every single day I think about her. Her room is the same. The bedspread is the same, drapes are the same. And my grandkids go in there to play, and that's how I introduce them to Tricia.'\n\nDuring the trial Gargiulo was described as having acting aspirations and working as an air conditioning repairman and Hollywood nightclub bouncer at the time of the attacks.\n\nHis defense lawyers urged jurors to reject the case, citing little physical evidence tying him to the killings of Bruno and Ellerin.\n\nProsecutors cited uncannily similar patterns in home-invasion attacks that were all in places near his residence at the time.\n\nThe parents of his victims broke down in tears as they described losing their loved ones in such horrific circumstances. Ashley Ellerin's mother Cynthia, right, told the court: 'I ache for her. I ache to hold her. I ache to hear her voice, to hug her.

It broke my wife and my son'\n\nAllowed to cite evidence from the Illinois case, they said all four attacks were the work of a skilled serial killer who studied the lives, homes and habits of victims that he stabbed quickly, powerfully and repeatedly with a knife that he knew how to use, and studied ways to cover his tracks.\n\nGargiulo's attorneys, citing expert trial testimony, had argued that he suffers from dissociative identity disorder, previously known as multiple personality disorder.\n\nDefense attorney Dale Rubin asked the jury: 'Mr. Gargiulo is going to die in prison. The question is when? Is it going to be in God\u2019s time or is it going to be in your time?'\n\nHe was found guilty of several special-circumstance allegations , including lying in wait and multiple murders, which make him eligible for the death penalty or life in prison with no possibility of parole.", "description": "A jury in LA is deciding whether Gargiulo, main, should face the death penalty after he was found guilty of stabbing Ashley Ellerin, 22, bottom inset, in 2001 and Maria Bruno, 32, top inset, in 2005.", "authors": ["Lauren Fruen For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/05/19425776-0-image-a-40_1570507879520.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
