The average house price actually slipped slightly between August and September, down 0.2 per cent, or \u00a3744 to \u00a3215,352.\n\nSlowdown: House price growth could dip into negative territory towards the end of the year\n\nThe average UK house price has dipped slightly after reaching a peak earlier this year, Nationwide's index shows\n\nHowever, the building society said housing activity remained stable despite a wider economic slowdown, continuing to be supported by low mortgages and rising wages.\n\nLower house price inflation means that home buyers are being presented with an opportunity to get a better deal, but separate reports suggest they are suffering from a lack of choice, with sellers reluctant to put their properties on the market.\n\nThe slide towards zero per cent growth, with the average home only \u00a3432 higher than a year ago, has led some to suggest that small annual house price falls will be seen this year.\n\n'It now seems quite likely that year-on-year house price growth will dip into negative territory in the last quarter of this year, as the Brexit uncertainty continues to subdue market activity,' said property analyst Mike Scott at estate agent Yopa.\n\n'However, the economic fundamentals of low unemployment, rising wages, good mortgage availability and low mortgage interest rates are still strong, and we expect a rapid recovery to a more normal level of activity and price growth once the uncertainty is finally resolved.'\n\nSeptember's 0.2 per cent annual property inflation marks the tenth consecutive month when house price growth was below 1 per cent, meaning that the month remained broadly in line with the rest of the year.\n\nAs other surveys have previously show, the picture changes across the country, with southern regions and London suffering falls and northern regions seeing growth.\n\nLondon saw prices fall 1.7 per cent and southern areas by 0.8 per cent, while northern regions and the Midlands combined saw prices rise 1.4 per cent.\n\nNorthern Ireland saw the strongest annual increase, with a 3.4 per cent uplift in property values, followed by Wales with a 2.9 per cent rise and North West of England with 2.5 per cent growth\n\nNationwide's house price index has shown that while it continues to be London, the commuter belt and South East that are seeing annual price falls, other previously hotter property markets across the county, such as the East Midlands, Wales and Yorkshire & Humber have also cooled\n\n'What these figures tell us is that there hasn\u2019t been much change in the market,' said Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent and a former RICS residential chairman.\n\n'On the ground, we have seen more serious buyers and sellers determined to find some middle ground and particularly for longer-term purchases such as larger flats and family houses where short-term uncertainties seem to be less relevant.'\n\nThe picture changes across the country, with southern regions and London suffering falls and northern regions seeing growth\n\nFalling prices in London mean the average price for a home in the capital is now \u00a3460,686.\n\nNationwide's chief economist Mike Gardner noted that despite the fall, prices in London are still 50 per cent above their 2007 levels.\n\nIn comparison, UK house prices generally are around 17 per cent higher than their 2007 peak.\n\n'These trends are not entirely unexpected, as affordability is still more stretched in the South, with prices further above their pre-financial crisis levels', Gardner said.\n\nHe added: 'The underlying pace of housing market activity has remained broadly stable, with the number of mortgages approved for house purchase continuing within the fairly narrow range prevailing over the past two years.\n\n'Healthy labour market conditions and low borrowing costs appear to be offsetting the drag from the uncertain economic outlook.'", "description": "Annual property inflation hit an eight-month low of 0.2 per cent in September, its lowest level since January,\u00a0according to the latest report by Nationwide.", "authors": ["Camilla Canocchi For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
