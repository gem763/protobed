And there are consequences: a new study by Digital Awareness UK found that young people with mental health issues who seek help online are receiving distressing criticism that they are jumping on a celeb-like publicity bandwagon, with it even making some children more vulnerable to online groomers.\n\nThe term \u201csadfishing\u201d is tellingly cruel, playing to the prejudice that people brave enough to open up about anxiety or depression are just attention seekers.\n\nThe truth is that talking about how we are feeling online should be encouraged, if done safely. For all its faults as a medium, social media can often feel an easier place on which to share than doing so in person; a kind of anonymous offload. I have seen many people with mental health and physical problems post online during a rough patch, and promptly get invaluable support from their online communities. Some interventions have even averted suicide.\n\nThe \u201csadfishing\u201d backlash surely has the problem backwards: the concern is not that too many young people talk about their mental health online, but that so many are struggling in the first place. Meanwhile, cuts to mental health support mean we can increasingly only turn to the internet for help.\n\nEven privileged celebrities such as Bieber have the human need to open up for their wellbeing, and can tackle stigma in doing so. After all, for all their charms, wealth and fame don\u2019t protect from sadness (a fact his young followers will benefit from hearing).\n\nThe last thing that anyone showing vulnerability needs is criticism. If in doubt, a bit of kindness can let all of us off the hook.", "description": "Young people and celebrities discussing their mental health are being denounced, but there is nothing wrong with turning to our online communities for support", "authors": ["Frances Ryan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45903a9c231e285ef2e40050644f4ddba68c73f7/0_0_6743_4046/master/6743.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7a0bf652bcd4fb90b87d3927dd28be1a"}
