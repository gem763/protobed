Users can simply text a number on their phone to post tweets on their feed and receive notifications. It's this function that has been disabled.\n\nThat's after a hacker group called the \"Chuckling Squad\" gained access to Dorsey's account on Friday and used it to tweet racist and anti-Semitic slurs.\n\nThe hackers are thought to have gained access to the account by using a tactic known as \"SIM hacking,\" whereby a hacker tricks a mobile carrier into transferring the victim's cellphone number onto a new phone, which is owned by the hackers. They then would have used Twitter's tweeting by text service to publish tweets on the victim's account.\n\nRead more: Hackers cracked Jack Dorsey's Twitter account using a very simple technique\n\nIn its announcement on Thursday, Twitter wrote: \"We're taking this step because of vulnerabilities that need to be addressed by mobile carriers and our reliance on having a linked phone number for two-factor authentication (we're working on improving this).\"\n\nTwitter added that this feature will be reactivated in the markets that depend on it as soon as possible. Text-to-tweet is likely more commonly used in emerging markets that have poor or no mobile internet coverage.\n\nDorsey has kept a low profile on Twitter for the past few days. On Wednesday, he finally broke his five-day silence, tweeting: \"Hello Melbourne,\" as he continued on an ongoing world tour.\n\nHe didn't initially address the hacking until prompted by New York Times journalist Kate Conger in a Twitter exchange.\n\nDorsey told Conger that he hadn't been on Twitter because he's had an issue with his carrier. He also said that he hasn't got a replacement phone number yet.", "description": "Last week, a hacker group called the \"Chuckling Squad\" gained access to Dorsey's account and used it to tweet racist and anti-Semitic slurs.", "authors": ["Mary Hanbury"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d70e42c2e22af039037ab78-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
