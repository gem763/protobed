(Getty Images)\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans rookie Zion Williamson, the No. 1 overall pick in this past June\u2019s NBA draft, will miss six to eight weeks after undergoing arthroscopic surgery on a torn right lateral meniscus, the team announced on Monday afternoon.\n\nNew Orleans opens its much anticipated 2019-20 schedule on Tuesday against the defending champion Toronto Raptors in Canada. The earliest side of his recovery timeline would keep him out until the first week of December, and an eight-week window would push his return closer to Christmas, when the Pelicans are scheduled to visit the Denver Nuggets. Either way, Williamson will miss somewhere between a quarter and a third of a season in which he was a favorite for Rookie of the Year.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe Pelicans ruled the star rookie out for Friday\u2019s preseason finale against the New York Knicks on Thursday night, citing knee soreness. Initial reports reflected confidence from the organization that Williamson avoided severe injury, even as ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reported that the 284-pound star would miss a \u201cperiod of weeks.\u201d This latest news sounds a little more dire.\n\nWilliamson missed all but one game in Summer League due to a bruised left knee. Pelicans executive vice president David Griffin said at the time it was out of an \u201cabundance of caution\u201d they were keeping him out. The new issue is on his other knee, the one that caused him to miss a portion of his freshman season at Duke when his shoe exploded and he suffered a sprain.\n\nWilliamson\u2019s rookie season pushed back\n\nStory continues\n\nPrior to the injury, Williamson was enjoying a stellar preseason performance, averaging 23.3 points, 6.5 rebounds and 2.3 assists over four games while shooting 71.4 percent from the field. He led the Pelicans in his most recent preseason game with a double-double of 22 points and 10 rebounds. His dunks have mesmerized fans, and he opened his NBA career with two of them.\n\nA favorite for Rookie of the Year before the injury announcement, Williamson told Yahoo Sports\u2019 Liz Roscher last week that he was more focused on the team than an individual accomplishment.\n\n\u201cTo win a championship and have an impact on the team, that would be my dream rookie season,\u201d he said.\n\nNew Orleans opens its home schedule a week from Friday against the Dallas Mavericks. The team has sold more season tickets than it has in the past decade and is now in the top half of the NBA in total sales thanks to the excitement Williamson brought to the city.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Zion Williamson had surgery to repair a torn right lateral meniscus.", "authors": ["Cassandra Negley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/KSW15UH5Mc6DHALKT4JhrA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MjEuNg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eFfWsrWBHw._CBD2hl7AvA--~B/aD0yMTI0O3c9Mjk0OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/2c32fc90-f1be-11e9-bdf7-e07d0b20077b", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
