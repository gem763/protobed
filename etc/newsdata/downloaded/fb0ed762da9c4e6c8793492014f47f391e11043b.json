Dwelling in a cave in perennial penance, he dedicates his exceptional language skills to making scripture more accessible to all,\u201d she said. \u201cHis body, obviously once muscular, has wizened to sinew and bone, his posture, once proud, is hunched upon itself; Jerome resembles a cavernous space, emptying himself to be filled with Christ.\u201d\n\nLev, the author of How Catholic Art Saved the Faith, said the technical aspects of the painting were vintage da Vinci.\n\n\u201cThe face of faith, of service, and of penitence as only Leonardo could draw,\u201d she told Crux. \u201cThe intimacy that drawing creates between the viewer and artist, makes one wonder, how much did the story of Jerome, communicator per excellence, resonate with Leonardo, the world\u2019s greatest painter, as he looked for a place to settle and develop his skills.\u201d\n\nLast year\u2019s Met exhibition, \u201cHeavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic imagination,\u201d which included vestments from the Sistine Chapel sacristy, was the most visited exhibit in the history of the Museum.\n\nRELATED: Based on Met exhibit, Catholic imagination still packs a punch\n\nBaruch College art historian Mar Morosse told Crux the two institutions, personified by the friendships between Barbara Jatta, who serves as the director of the Vatican Museums, and Met curator Carmen Bambach is one of the primary reasons the Met is able to display the masterpiece, which rarely leaves Italy.\n\nBambach, she noted, is an expert in da Vinci, and she said the friendship between the two women, and the recent success of last year\u2019s exhibit, have only strengthened ties between the Vatican and the Met.\n\nIn September, Jatta will travel to New York to give a lecture at the Met in conjunction with the exhibit.\n\n\u201cThe Met is a global museum unlike any other in the world,\u201d said Morosse. \u201cAnd both the Vatican Museums and the Met have high standards for excellence.\u201d\n\nLev concurred, telling Crux \u201cthe Vatican Museums has used art as a means to build bridges and create bonds with people of all faiths, backgrounds and cultures for centuries.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the foundation of the museums to the loan of Raphael\u2019s works to both Germany and England under Benedict XVI, as well as the reliquaries and vestments sent to the Met\u2019s Heavenly Bodies exhibit last year, the Catholic Church has proposed beauty as a means to cross cultural borders and recount universal truths in a compelling way,\u201d said Lev.\n\nThe painting of \u201cSaint Jerome Praying in the Wilderness\u201d will be on display in New York until October 6.\n\nFollow Christopher White on Twitter: @cwwhite212\n\nCrux is dedicated to smart, wired and independent reporting on the Vatican and worldwide Catholic Church.
