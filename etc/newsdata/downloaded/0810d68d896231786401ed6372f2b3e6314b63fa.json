The increase may validate Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook\u2019s strategy of offering budget-conscious consumers less expensive models amid signs of a weakening economy, it said.\n\nMajor improvements to the iPhone\u2019s camera, including the addition of a new ultrawide camera for better architectural and tourist photos, alongside better battery life and improved durability may have resonated with consumers. The entry point for new iPhones was also lowered for the first time, with the iPhone 11 starting at $699 or $50 less than its predecessor.\n\nWith the increase in production, Apple is anticipating selling more iPhones in the closing months of this year than it did during the same period last year, the Nikkei Asian Review reported. Shares in suppliers Murata Manufacturing Co. and Alps Alpine Co. climbed after the report.", "description": "Suppliers have been told to increase production of the latest iPhone due to strong demand, the Nikkei Asian Review said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/4/2507691ba31043bf8502066d888b0a7b_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
