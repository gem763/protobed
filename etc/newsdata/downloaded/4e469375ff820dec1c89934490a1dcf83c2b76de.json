As such, their messages were peppered with pop culture references and quotes \u2013 most noticeably from Glee.\n\n\u2018Often when she was writing to Conrad or about Conrad, she would borrow from text that was in this TV show,\u2019 the writer explained. \u2018I think she connected with Lea Michele on a kind of profound level that went beyond what a normal teen identifying with a star, you know, may feel like.\u2019\n\nThere some harrowing similarities between Michelle Carter\u2019s real-life case and Glee (Picture: REX)\n\nIn one message, Carter quotes Berry verbatim by writing: \u2018you were my first love, and I wanted more than anything for you to be my last.\u2019 In the context of the show, Michele\u2019s character says this line to her boyfriend \u2013 Finn Hudson (Monteith) \u2013 before breaking up with him.\n\nBarron also noted an ever more harrowing similarity between the Massachusetts native and her fictional obsession. Conrad\u2019s body was found by police on July 13, 2014. That is exactly one year to the day that Cory Monteith\u2019s body was found by police in a hotel room.
