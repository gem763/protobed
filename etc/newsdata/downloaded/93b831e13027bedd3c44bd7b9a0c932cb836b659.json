He vowed to call new legislative elections to let voters weigh in on a dispute he says has stymied his bid to stamp out graft in the ruling class.\n\nInside La Pampa: the illegal mining city Peru is trying to wipe out Read more\n\nOpposition representatives cried \u201cDictator\u201d after Vizcarra invoked a constitutional article allowing presidents to dissolve Congress. The chamber immediately voted to declare him temporarily suspended, naming vice president Mercedes Araoz to replace him.\n\nBut a government source said their efforts were void, since Congress was already officially closed.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mart\u00edn Vizcarra announces the dissolution of Congress on Monday night. Photograph: Juan Pablo Azabache/AFP/Getty Images\n\nVizcarra accused Popular Force, the opposition majority party led by jailed former presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori, of trying to use democratic institutions for personal gain.\n\nThe party has dragged its feet on passing his anti-corruption reforms and last week shelved his bill for a snap general election to end the impasse.\n\nThe last straw, Vizcarra said, was Congress\u2019 appointment on Monday of a new member to the top court, the constitutional tribunal, which would be the likely referee in a legal dispute between Congress and the government.\n\nProposed nominees for up to six of the tribunal\u2019s seven members had drawn fire for links to criminally suspect judges.\n\n\u201cWhat happened in Congress underscores the shamelessness to which the parliamentary majority has fallen,\u201d Vizcarra added.\n\nPeru\u2019s mining-powered economy has largely shrugged off increasing bouts of political turmoil in recent years, including the resignation last year of former president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in a clash with Popular Force.\n\nKuczynski and Peru\u2019s three other most recent presidents have been ensnared in a massive bribery scandal involving Brazilian builder Odebrecht.\n\nFujimori, the daughter of former authoritarian president Alberto Fujimori, is in pre-trial detention in a case related to Odebrecht.\n\nProtesters gathered outside Congress in Lima on Monday night to pressure lawmakers to leave, while police in riot gear stood by. Domestic media said protests in support of Vizcarra had also started in other cities across the country.\n\nMost Peruvians in recent opinion polls have expressed support for the dissolution of Congress. Vizcarra is often greeted on the streets with shouts encouraging the move.\n\nPeru\u2019s constitution allows presidents to dissolve Congress to call new elections if lawmakers deliver two votes of no-confidence in a government. The current Congress has already voted once that it had no confidence in the government.\n\nVizcarra said he counted Congress\u2019 appointment of a new member to the constitutional tribunal as a second vote of no-confidence.\n\nBut lawmakers, who voted to renew their confidence in his government on Monday, said he had overstepped constitutional limits by overriding Congress\u2019 powers to appoint tribunal judges.\n\n\u201cVizcarra and his ministers will end up in jail. We will end up in history!\u201d said former congressman Jorge del Castillo.", "description": "Political crisis comes to a head as lawmakers remain in chamber in defiance of Mart\u00edn Vizcarra and popular protests", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5af421bd3d321a43db71a68d76e8f1f271ecb7a/0_220_6250_3751/master/6250.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a9214fb6d49c3926a62af20998f67b37", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
