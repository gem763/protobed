David Rowe\n\nFears of a second strike inside the Tabcorp camp had already been eased as the reports from proxy advisers rolled in, with Ownership Matters, CGI Glass Lewis, the Australian Shareholders Association and the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors all in favour of both the pay report and Dwyer\u2019s re-election. ISS are in favour of the former and against the latter.\n\nIt appears unlikely a second strike eventuates and even Dwyer\u2019s critics admit she\u2019s safe, with a 50 per cent vote against required to oust her.\n\nDwyer has been justifiably keen to make sure the integration of Tabcorp and Tatts is complete before she takes her retires from the board; leaving with the job half done isn\u2019t Dwyer\u2019s style and probably wouldn\u2019t have been appreciated by the bulk of the register.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean the tension between Tabcorp and its investors has dissipated.\n\nFor example, there was surprise in some quarters at the announcement of former rugby league and soccer boss David Gallop as a director last week. That\u2019s not to say he won\u2019t do a good job, it\u2019s just that he\u2019s an unknown quantity on an ASX board.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat appointment has put an ever sharper focus on board succession and it\u2019s understood Tabcorp director Bruce Akhurst has discussed the issue in a round of meetings with investors.\n\nThe mood in some quarters is that the selection of the next chairman is crucial, with a clear push for someone from outside the board who will be tough on management.\n\nWhile Attenborough has long called for patience, arguing that is not until the Tatts and Tabcorp wagering businesses are properly combined that the success of the integration can be judged, it\u2019s a certainty that investor pressure for better performance will not let up anytime soon.\n\nThe WA tote race looks likely to be a much smoother process for Tabcorp.\n\nAlready the short-priced favourite to buy the business given the obvious synergies with its existing retail operations in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and the Northern Territory, observers say the recent announcement of a $15 billion merger between global giants Flutter (parent company of leading local online bookmaker Sportsbet) and The Stars Group (parent of BetEasy) has strengthened Tabcorp\u2019s hand.\n\nWhile those close to the WA sale process hope the combined entity could be an even stronger bidder, and warn the WA tote is the last retail asset on the market for a player so wants to properly challenge Tabcorp, the merger is not due to complete until as late as September next year, well after the WA sales process completes.\n\nTo be clear, all interested parties remain in the race - no-one wants to let Tabcorp get this assess too easily. But there are doubts Sportsbet and BetEasy will want to tackle such a deal while the merger roles on. Online bookmaker Ladbrokes is also in a bit of flux, following the recent departure of chief executive Jason Scott, with Dean Shannon taking the role.\n\nThe word is that the WA government might be quietly relieved at the prospect that the merger could make it tougher for Sportsbet. The state\u2019s naturally conservative outlook may not have been the best fit with Sportsbet\u2019s very blokey - and occasionally controversial - approach to marketing.", "description": "Wagering and lotteries giant Tabcorp should avoid a second strike, and its chairman is safe, but the pressure on the board remains.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_54/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4f358ae8b907a03386cfc756c0c70ad4a98db385", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
