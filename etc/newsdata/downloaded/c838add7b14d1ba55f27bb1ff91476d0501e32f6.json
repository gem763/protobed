It really does,\" Boone said. \"One of the things that we talked about in spring training was winning the division, and that's a reality now.\n\n\"Obviously we have bigger goals, but this is an important step and I'm just proud of the guys and so many people -- some that aren't even in that room right now -- that have contributed to us being here.\"\n\nRight fielder Aaron Judge sat out the game a day after getting banged up making a diving catch.\n\nBoone said he thought Judge was fine, and the right fielder was on hand for the post-game celebration -- although he said the team's priority remained a 28th World Series title.\n\n\"We had a goal in spring training to come out and win the division. We knew how important that was to be World Series champions,\" Judge said. \"Now we want to go out there and do that.\"\n\nGardner added: \"We've got a lot of baseball left to play\" and it is \"hopefully the beginning of something special.\"\n\nThe Yankees have struggled with injuries all season, with 30 players landing on the injured list.\n\nThey could find themselves without another key player in the post-season after Major League Baseball placed pitcher Domingo German on administrative leave under its domestic violence policy.\n\nNo immediate details of what led to the move were immediately given, but the 27-year-old Dominican right-hander will be sidelined while an investigation is ongoing.", "description": "The New York Yankees clinched their first American League East division title since 2012 on Thursday with their 100th win of the Major League Baseball season.
