It includes the creation of a new body, the Office for Environmental Protection.\n\nThe Department for Transport said that it plans to start a consultation looking at how all modes of transport can help deliver the sorts of cuts needed to reach net-zero carbon.\n\n\u201cWe want to work with industry and communities around the country to develop this plan \u2013- to make our towns and cities better places to live, help to create new jobs, improve air quality and our health, and take urgent action on climate change,\u201d said Grant Shapps, the transport secretary.\n\nSince the U.K. passed into law its intention to become a net-zero emissions economy by mid-century, it has made billions of pounds worth of commitments into battery, hydrogen and carbon-capture technology. In its July report the Committee on Climate Change said that the previous government had delivered on just one of the 25 policy areas needed to meet emissions targets.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jeremy Hodges in London at jhodges17@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Reed Landberg at landberg@bloomberg.net, Andrew Reierson, Lars Paulsson\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Britain plans to introduce a range of new measures for improving energy efficiency and cutting transport emissions in a bid to speed up its response to tackle climate change.A new Environment Bill introduced to Parliament on Tuesday is in response to criticism from the government\u2019s own", "authors": ["Jeremy Hodges"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/s7DRdVFYRocyIrfwvJs49A--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/0ad849f52d4c7b3955f9b91d8dcf1166", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
