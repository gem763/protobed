Butterfly\u201d) for dreaming up a wildly ambitious premise that results in gleeful, if unruly, entertainment about geopolitical dynamics and personal and national identity. The core of \u201cSoft Power,\u201d which marked its official opening Tuesday at off-Broadway\u2019s Public Theater, is a commentary on the evolving rivalry between China and the United States. The relationship is filtered here through a nation\u2019s \u201csoft\u201d conveyance of influence: its commercial art.\n\nCombined with elements of Hwang\u2019s own story, including a life-threatening stabbing attack on a Brooklyn street in 2015, \u201cSoft Power\u201d pivots a little too glibly from one conceit to another. The production, directed by Leigh Silverman, with music by \u201cFun Home\u2019s\u201d Jeanine Tesori, isn\u2019t a mess, exactly; it\u2019s just that as the creative team weaves its sardonic tapestry, you remain aware of there being too many threads and too much facile stitching.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYet, because of the concept\u2019s ingenious underpinnings and the cunning abandon with which the playwright throws himself at the challenge, \u201cSoft Power\u201d provides just enough satisfaction for the two hours you spend with it. Because it\u2019s fun to watch a play grapple with such big ideas, you forgive it some of the problems with plotting.\n\nThe musical-within-a-play is set up thusly: Hwang, played by his longtime actor-muse, Francis Jue, is recruited by a Chinese businessman, X\u016be X\u00edng (Conrad Ricamora), to adapt a hit Chinese rom-com into a Western-style musical with the title \u201cStick With Your Mistake.\u201d Elements of the businessman\u2019s own life make their way into the musical: He\u2019s infatuated with Hillary Clinton (Alyse Alan Louis) after meeting her during the 2016 campaign. So as we segue from Hwang in the hospital to the musical in his head, Ricamora\u2019s and Louis\u2019s characters metamorphose into the lovers, with romance-starved Hillary trying desperately to be all things to all voters.\n\nEmbedded in \u201cSoft Power\u201d is a clever distillation of what the misperceptions of the West might be to Chinese who\u2019ve never visited, a variation of what Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman explored in their Japan-set 1976 musical \u201cPacific Overtures\u201d: When Hwang\u2019s musical\u2019s X\u016be arrives in an inexact conjuring of New York (with the Golden Gate Bridge on the horizon), he\u2019s greeted by a caricatured chorus of hucksters, including one named Tony Manero. You may remember Tony as a Bay Ridge character played by John Travolta in \u201cSaturday Night Fever.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAmerican audiences can appreciate both what Chinese imaginations might get right as well as wrong about us. Hwang riffs here on the electoral absurdity that ushered into the nation\u2019s highest office a candidate who did not receive the majority of the votes. When Hillary tries to explain the democratic system to X\u016be, his retort makes too much humiliating sense. \u201cA very nice dream,\u201d he says, \u201cthat people are smart enough, wise enough. Worthy of trust enough to decide their own futures. The problem with such dreams is that they are not true. This is why in China we do not allow the people to select our leaders.\u201d\n\nThe bulk of \u201cSoft Power\u2019s\u201d satirical oomph is carried by the musical numbers, which float on Tesori\u2019s lush compositions and Bryce Cutler\u2019s superior orchestrations, performed by an orchestra 20 instrumentalists strong and conducted by Chris Fenwick. (A high point occurs with the reveal of the musicians on the tiered backdrop of Clint Ramos\u2019s set.) One could wish for lyrics, credited to Hwang and Tesori, that were up to the richness of the music; as it is they are merely serviceable. Perhaps this is intentional, a reflection of the limits of the attempt to imitate an American form. In any case, they fall dully on the ear.\n\nThe principal actors \u2014 Jue, Ricamora and Louis \u2014 handle the heavy-duty roles with aplomb, and 11 supporting players add their vocal strengths admirably: The show sounds full-bodied on the Public\u2019s Newman Theater stage. The larger issues \u201cSoft Power\u201dseeks to amplify end up a bit muffled by the author\u2019s need to apply autobiography and ultimately, a sentimental finish. But even if Hwang invites you here to do some of the editing work in your own head, he makes this sprawling event a jaunty assignment.\n\nSoft Power, by David Henry Hwang, music by Jeanine Tesori.
