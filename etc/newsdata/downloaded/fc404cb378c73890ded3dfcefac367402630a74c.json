Last year, I was suffering mentally and emotionally, and I wasn\u2019t able to stay all that kept together. I wasn\u2019t able to hold a smile or to keep things looking normal,\" she said, as seen in a fan video.\n\nLast October, Gomez sought treatment. A source told Fox News at the time, \"Selena has emotional stresses as many other people also do. She has taken it upon herself to tackle her emotional issues head-on and is seeking treatment at an East Coast facility.\"\n\n\"It felt like all of my pain and my anxiety washed over me all at once and it was one of the scariest moments of my life,\" Gomez said earlier this month.

I can say that after a year of a lot of intense work, that I am happier, I am healthier, and I am in control of my emotions and thoughts more than I've ever been,\" she said. \"So, I\u2019m very happy about that.\"\n\nSELENA GOMEZ SLAMS INSTAGRAM, CALLS IT 'DANGEROUS, UNHEALTHY'\n\nGomez also explained the fear she constantly felt about opening up about her mental health, adding that she ultimately made it a point to herself to help as many people through their struggles as she could, according to the hospital's website.\n\n\"It feels right to share that I have personally felt the effects of both depression and anxiety \u2013 but it isn't easy. I have feared being misunderstood and judged,\" she said. \"I know that I have been given experiences and people and opportunities that have made my life exceptionally beautiful and sweet \u2013 and yet I struggle with my own thoughts and feelings at times.\"\n\nGomez shared an image to social media of her time at the ceremony, posing with her award.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"So humbled to have been part of the incredible McLean Hospital\u2019s Annual Dinner and was honored to be able to share a bit of my story,\" Gomez wrote in the photo caption. \"Thank you Dr. Rauch for inviting me and spending time speaking with me about mental health.
