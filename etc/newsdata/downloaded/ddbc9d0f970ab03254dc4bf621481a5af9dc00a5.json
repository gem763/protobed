John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, praised the Trump administration for conducting an operation in Syria that resulted in the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, but said the House Intelligence Committee, on which he serves, has failed to address ISIS or other terrorism-related issues lately because of the ongoing impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe committee's chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., has been going full-throttle with the impeachment inquiry, holding closed-door interviews with witnesses connected to the Trump administration\u2019s policies on Ukraine.\n\nAs a result, Ratcliffe said, other issues have fallen by the wayside.\n\nTRUMP DESCRIBES AL-BAGHDADI AS 'WHIMPERING AND CRYING' BEFORE DYING IN U.S. OPERATION: 'HE DIED LIKE A COWARD'\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the Intelligence Committee that I serve on hasn\u2019t been spending a whole lot of time on these issues. We\u2019ve been caught up in Adam Schiff\u2019s secret impeachment inquiry, so we haven\u2019t had a briefing on these issues,\u201d Ratcliffe told Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d when asked about what kind of information U.S. forces may have recovered from al-Baghdadi\u2019s compound. \u201cBut, I am certain that much like what happened with Al Qaeda, that the documents that we recovered, the treasure trove of information that has already been related by the president, is going to have a profound impact on operations in the Middle East of all terrorists.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by host Maria Bartiromo how long it has been since the committee had a briefing on terrorism, Ratcliffe said, \u201cIt\u2019s been well over a month,\u201d and he could not recall exactly when the last briefing was.\n\nHOUSE DEMS ANGERED THAT TRUMP TOLD RUSSIA, TURKEY OF AL-BAGHDADI RAID, BUT NOT PELOSI\n\n\u201cAll I can remember is one ambassador after another that I\u2019ve never heard of before,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019ve been spending our time, unfortunately.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Schiff celebrated the operation that led to al-Baghdadi\u2019s death in an interview on ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week,\u201d calling it \u201can important victory against this brutal killer.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, continued Ratcliffe\u2019s criticism of the impeachment inquiry later in the program. He blasted House Democrats saying they were putting all of their efforts into impeachment at the expense of other business, while President Trump \u201ckept his eye on the ball.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe shows that you can do two things at one time,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, our House can\u2019t do that, Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats are incapable of doing that.\u201d\n\nFox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo contributed to this report.", "description": "Rep.
