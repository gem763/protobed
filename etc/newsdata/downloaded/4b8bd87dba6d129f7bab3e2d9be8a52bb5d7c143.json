That has always annoyed me how candidates feel they have to advertise the stars and stripes to get elected. #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate \u2014 Scott Santens\ud83e\udde2 (@scottsantens) October 16, 2019\n\nDoes Andrew Yang's lapel pin really say math? #DemocraticDebate \u2014 Jo Kaur (@SikhFeminist) October 16, 2019\n\n#yang gets it. he knows when he hits a solid line and ends his time without going over. also, he doesn\u2019t risk losing his closer being drowned out by speaking over the moderator.\n\nplus that math pin \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25#YangGang #DemDebates \u2014 Nic Nemeth (@HEELZiggler) October 16, 2019\n\nAndrew Yang is wearing a pin that just says \u2018Math\u2019 and honestly that gives me extreme amounts of anxiety \ud83d\ude43 \u2014 Ashley Green (@agreenphotog) October 16, 2019\n\nAndrew Yang \"MATH\" pin deserves more attention \u2014 Chris Cillizza (@CillizzaCNN) October 16, 2019\n\nAndrew Yang is wearing a \"Math\" pin as he courts the hard to reach \"Math nerd\" voting bloc #DemocraticDebate \u2014 (((DeanObeidallah))) (@DeanObeidallah) October 16, 2019\n\nYang: \"Math\"\n\n\n\nWarren: \"Data\"\n\n\n\nNow we just need a candidate whose slogan is \"Econometrics\" and we'll have a first year grad school curriculum \u2014 Noah Smith \ud83d\udc07 (@Noahpinion) October 16, 2019\n\nAndrew Yang is wearing a \"math\" pin. I assume he's trolling Donald Trump, who can't do math. The difficulty: Donald Trump can't read the pin, because he also can't read. \u2014 Palmer Report (@PalmerReport) October 16, 2019\n\nI like Andrew Yang\u2019s math pin. I feel all the candidates should have a pin with their favorite word on it. Mine would be either LIGHTSABER or MARTINI. #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/6LyDknth8k \u2014 Joseph Scrimshaw (@JosephScrimshaw) October 16, 2019\n\nthe highlight of the debate so far has obviously been Andrew Yang\u2019s \u201cmath\u201d lapel pin \u2014 Alexandra DeSanctis (@xan_desanctis) October 16, 2019\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nRead Live Updates From The 4th Democratic Presidential Debate\n\nDemocrats Get Bogged Down In Same Gotcha Tax Question At Every Debate\n\nDemocratic Candidates Turn Fire On New Front-Runner Elizabeth Warren\n\nLove HuffPost?
