(MSFT) is the Stock of the Day at Real Money here on Thursday after it released first-quarter results Wednesday night that comfortably beat earnings and revenue expectations. We wrote about MSFT on Monday and recommended that traders go long MSFT \"at current levels, risking to $130 while targeting $181 or higher.\" MSFT was trading about 1% higher in the pre-market activity Thursday, so let's check out the charts one more time on Microsoft, which is a holding of Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS charitable trust.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of MSFT, below, we can see that prices are still in a four- to five-month sideways consolidation pattern. With a higher start anticipated for here on Thursday we could be starting an upside breakout. Prices are poised to swing back above the neutral 50-day moving average line. The slower-to-react 200-day moving average line is showing us a strong positive slope.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) could turn to the upside if we close higher here on Thursday on heavy volume. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is just slightly above the zero line in positive territory, but a decisive move up here on Thursday could strength the trend and this indicator.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of MSFT, below, we can see that prices are still nicely above the rising 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line has been steady in recent months and a strong finish to the month could tip the line to the upside. The MACD oscillator on this longer time frame has been in a take profits mode, but strong prices should narrow the two moving averages that make up this tool and yield a fresh buy signal in a few weeks.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of MSFT, below, we can see that as of Wednesday's close a downside price target has been projected. A trade at $143.60 will be an upside breakout on this chart and it would refresh the uptrend. The software would then switch to an upside price target.\n\nBottom line strategy: MSFT should have a higher start Thursday. Good strength Thursday and Friday could give us an upside breakout.
