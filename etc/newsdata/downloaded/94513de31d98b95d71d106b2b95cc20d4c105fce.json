It won\u2019t, however, work for the vast bulk of retiring Australians who will soon have to either pay a great deal more for financial planning and advice, or take their chances with robo-advice,\u201d national secretary Julia Angrisano said.\n\nMLC appeared to back this up on Thursday when it announced its new financial advice business would focus on high net worth and affluent customers rather than the mass market.\n\nExperts say one out of every two Australians has unmet financial advice needs with the worst cases resulting in broken families, mental health issues and even homelessness.\n\nFinancial Services Council CEO Sally Loane said it was essential the next iteration of financial advice remained affordable for the 80 per cent of Australians who earn around $80,000 or less.\n\n\u201cAdvice must be equally accessible for all income earners, not just the wealthy,\u201d Ms Loane said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe once dominant model of vertical integration, where banks had large networks of financial planners, has been almost completely unwound in the wake of the Hayne royal commission, where banks were revealed to have starved wealth divisions of investment.\n\nAMP CEO Francesco De Ferrari (right) and Alex Wade when they worked at Credit Suisse Private Bank in Australia in 2017. Wolter Peeters\n\nThe last of the big four banks to sever its ties with wealth is NAB, which revealed on Thursday it expected to divest the business known as MLC by June 30 next year.\n\nMLC chief executive and former Perpetual boss Geoff Lloyd told the media the company would hand back three of its five financial advice licences as it refocused on high net worth customers.\n\n\u201cWe know that advice market is growing, particularly at the 45-year-plus age, which is inheriting more money than any other generation,\u201d Mr Lloyd said.\n\nAMP believes it can stake out a claim by covering all three bases through what it calls a tiered offering.\n\nIn this version the low-end would be served by digital and the high end by advisers. They believe the middle ground can be captured over the phone.\n\nAMP\u2019s CEO of wealth management, Alex Wade, said the model had achieved some success in both the UK and the US and cited a recent study.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA large portion, close to 40 per cent who have left face-to-face advice, have shifted to digital or phone-based capacity,\u201d Mr Wade said.\n\nAMP could not tell AFR Weekend how many of these tele-advisers it had employed or how many it planned to hire.\n\nGlenn Calder, the chief executive of Viridian Financial Group, said the industry would face an enormous challenge over the next decade as millions of baby boomers entered retirement and needed financial advice.\n\nViridian bought part of Westpac\u2019s BT Financial Advice arm in March, and is owned entirely by its employees and clients.\n\nLike most in the sector, Mr Calder said it was unclear how the gap between cheap robo advice and full-service financial planning would be filled.\n\n\u201cThat gap in the middle is going to be astounding. I think the distance between the two of them has to blur.\u201d\n\nMr Calder said some sort of digitally enabled advice model was possible, but cautioned that many parts of the Australian wealth sector were too complex to be handled by robo advice alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuper and the aged pension were two examples.\n\n\u201cAged care is a minefield, estate planning is a minefield,\u201d Mr Calder said. \u201cThe need for advice as all the baby boomers move into retirement is going to be huge.\u201d\n\nHe said these difficulties could ensure international product providers, such as Blackrock and Fidelity, thought twice before entering the market.\n\nIndeed, Mr Calder said just identifying companies with the right solutions that Viridian could partner with was proving difficult.\n\nWhile the industry gropes for answers to fill the advice gap, Mr Calder said there was also a huge opportunity for Australia to develop a strong model and avoid the pitfalls of Britain and the United States.\n\nNew advocates\n\nThere are estimates that 5.4 million people in the UK have fallen into an advice gap, mainly due to the cost of accessing services.\n\nIn the US, access to advice has been improved, and costs lowered, by lowering the fiduciary obligations of advisers. Hopefully we land somewhere in the middle that\u2019s a bit more pragmatic,\u201d Mr Calder said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe plight of advisers is attracting new advocates to the industry in the form of the union movement.\n\nThe Finance Sector Union, whose members have traditionally been drawn from the now dwindling cohort of bank branch workers, is looking to attract advisers as new members and has begun a campaign of advocacy against the design of new educational standards being overseen by the Financial Adviser Standards and Ethics Authority.\n\nThe FSU has been lobbying on the issue in Canberra and hopes to lure members away from traditional industry representative groups such as the Financial Planning Association and the Association of Financial Advisers, which have been supportive of FASEA.\n\nThe FPA and AFA on Friday were expected to apply with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to become a \u201ccode monitoring authority\u201d to oversee the new FASEA Code of Ethics, which some advisers consider an unnecessary additional level of regulation.\n\nNo recognition of experience\n\nThe FSU\u2019s national assistant secretary Nathan Rees, a former premier of NSW, has been working alongside Ms Angrisano to push back on FASEA\u2019s qualifications thresholds, arguing they fail to recognise advisers\u2019 experience and warning they will push more experienced advisers out of the industry.\n\n\u201cThe industry is being shaken to the core by the new regime. Left unchanged there will be many planners and advisers who will be losers,\u201d Ms Angrisano said.\n\n\u201cThere is very little scope for the recognition of an adviser\u2019s decades of experience. The current policy and legislative framework within which the advice industry operates is running dangerously close to forcing many experts, with years of experience, out of the industry.\u201d\n\nMLC also said it would double the fee it charges self-employed advisers to use its systems due to soaring compliance and education costs, including those forced onto the industry by FASEA.", "description": "Tough new regulations are set to leave the industry and millions of Australians unwilling or unable to pay for financial advice.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_80/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f7db3ba7ade7eeb65e83441652b58a75446e5b69", "published_at": "2019-08-16"}
