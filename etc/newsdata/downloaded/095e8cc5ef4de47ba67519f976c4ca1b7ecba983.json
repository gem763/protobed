I was shocked after the briefest conversation with someone delivering shopping a couple of weeks ago as we quickly moved to why, in his view, Brexit must be implemented to \u201cright the wrongs of the Second World War\u201d.\n\nOur prime minister\u2019s warlike language, coupled with one-sided reporting of our negotiations with the EU has created a toxic cocktail, and it is fuelling alienation and frustration with politicians and our political process.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

And that was without wall-to-wall coverage of high-octane parliamentary debates like the one we saw on Wednesday night.\n\nBack then, it felt more like a drip-drip effect from articles in the Brexit-supporting, right-wing media and from ugly campaign posters. Most of it took place beyond the Palace of Westminster and it was startling to encounter. I campaigned in towns around the southwest of England and witnessed threatening and violent language directed at our youngest campaigners, many of them female.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.\" Shutterstock / sasha2109\n\nIt frightened me \u2013 and I\u2019ve been active in politics for more than a decade. Three years on, and it feels like the same kind of divisive rhetoric is being spouted at the despatch box and has become part of our political culture.\n\nIn the post-referendum era of Brexit politics, helped along by our creaky two-party system, calls for consensus and nuance have been swept aside in favour of picking sides. The temptation is huge for the more brittle, less principled politicians. There are two vast hulks of the electorate wedded to either side of a binary issue and apparently willing to suspend their critical faculties for the duration. Too many politicians have succumbed to that temptation.\n\nAs things stand, political language is deteriorating at such a rate, and being so damaged I\u2019m not sure I could face campaigning in the upcoming election. If this is the state of the political debate right now \u2013 then imagine the election campaign? I\u2019ve been dreading it for months.\n\nWe can get excited about BBC Parliament\u2019s viewing figures but let\u2019s get real: a minority of the population will have seen last night\u2019s debate in full or in part. Most people will hear about it via tabloid headlines and social media.\n\nRegardless of whether or not MPs agree or disagree with what the prime minister chose to say, what people will hear is the use and legitimisation of rhetoric that has been seen in threats to MPs and forms the foundation for the kind of hate speech seen around the country since the referendum. The medium is the message.\n\nBoris Johnson appears to think he can benefit, personally and politically, by levering wide the cracks opened by Brexit \u2013 and seems unconcerned when dignity and discourse fall into the abyss. He smirked as the objections to his language mounted, then flounced out of the house while his conduct came under scrutiny and the real-world implications were raised.\n\nI have deep sympathy with MPs, candidates and their staff who are on the front line in this war of words. Who can blame them if they fear going out to the doorsteps of their constituencies or holding surgeries? Accessibility to the public is at the root of our representative politics. Things can\u2019t go on as they are.\n\nThis is not just a Tory problem. Politicians of all sides need to choose their language carefully \u2013 even more so at times like this. These make the actions of Labour\u2019s Emily Thornberry apologising for remarks she made about the Liberal Democrats\u2019 Brexit policy all the more laudable. As Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said on Wednesday night, if a five-year-old can apologise so can a party leader.\n\nDaisy Benson is a Liberal Democrat activist and a former prospective parliamentary candidate for the party", "description": "The language used by Boris Johnson in the Commons on Wednesday was pretty horrible, but it\u2019s when you hear the same things coming out of the mouths of\u00a0members of the public that things get really scary.", "authors": ["Daisy Benson"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/25/14/supreme-court-protest-brexit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
