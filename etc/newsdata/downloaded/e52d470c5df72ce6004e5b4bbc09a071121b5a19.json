Its central bank has been drawing down its foreign exchange reserves to repay the state's maturing debt.\n\nHariri held two meetings in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday to \"accelerate\".\n\nSignificant UAE investment in Lebanon would mark a new phase in relations. For the UAE, the benefits could include building political sway to counter the powerful Iran-backed Shi'ite Lebanese group Hezbollah while also the chance to invest in Lebanon's nascent oil and gas sector or its port.
