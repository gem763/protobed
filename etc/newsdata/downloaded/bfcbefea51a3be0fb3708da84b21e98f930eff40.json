He was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead, WABC-TV reported.\n\nA New York City Police Department spokesperson identified the officer to HuffPost as a member of the Sergeants Benevolent Association, which is a police sergeants union. The SBA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nFor the 10th time this year, an NYPD officer has died by suicide. The city's police commissioner had declared a mental health crisis earlier this year after four officers died by suicide in one month.

The NYPD has said it will typically see four or five suicides within its force in a year.\n\nThe NYPD and the Department of Investigation\u2019s Office of the Inspector General for the NYPD have since announced they will work to reduce the stigma among officers that\u2019s associated with seeking mental help as well as implement programs and training on officer wellness and safety, including suicide intervention.\n\nTragically, we have lost another NYPD member to suicide. We\u2019re taking great steps to end this mental-health crisis, and we vow to always keep fighting. Please take care of yourselves and regularly check up on your colleagues and loved ones. #StopSuicide \u27a1\ufe0f https://t.co/WzM1CYn8Lf pic.twitter.com/BFtxCkNGDE \u2014 Commissioner O\u2019Neill (@NYPDONeill) October 16, 2019\n\n\u201cSimply put, the stress of the job when coupled with the personal stresses known to every human being, weigh heavily and continuously on the minds of our officers,\u201d the NYPD said in a letter to city officials last month. \u201cFor reasons which remain unknown, that weight has brought about a significant increase in the number of NYPD officers taking their own lives this year.\u201d\n\nLaw enforcement officers in crisis can text BLUE to 741741 for help.\n\nIf you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.
