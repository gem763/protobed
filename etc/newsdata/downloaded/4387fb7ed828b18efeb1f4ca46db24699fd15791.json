Trump has also accused the Obama administration and FBI officials of treason for their actions in the Russia investigation.\n\nFormer officials had expressed repeated concern about Durham\u2019s inquiry in recent weeks, saying there were indications that it was expanding beyond a typical look-back at how high-profile matters were handled. The conversion of the probe to a criminal investigation was first reported on Thursday by the New York Times.\n\nManagement reviews are typically conducted by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Inspector General, which has spent more than a year investigating the contents of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications that the FBI and Justice Department submitted for Carter Page, an energy industry specialist who had served as a Trump campaign adviser.\n\nDurham\u2019s investigation appears to be broader than the OIG inquiry, although the full scope of his probe remains unclear.\n\nAs the impeachment inquiry that is focused on Trump has intensified in recent days, Republicans have been complaining about delays in the release of the OIG report. The Justice Department\u2019s inspector general, Michael Horowitz, said in a letter to lawmakers on Thursday that a draft of his report was still undergoing a classification review process involving department officials and the FBI.\n\n\u201cThe process is ongoing and nearing completion,\u201d Horowitz said, without promising any specific timing for public release of the report.\n\nFormer officials consulted by POLITICO said that they were puzzled by the development but that it was possible Durham believes someone involved in the Russia probe gave false testimony or intentionally introduced inaccurate information during the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act process. The ex-officials said that it was possible the career prosecutor is investigating potential political motivation by officials at the CIA or FBI, but that it would be difficult to pursue as a criminal case.\n\nThe chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), voiced concern on Thursday night about the turn of events.\n\n\u201cThese reports, if true, raise profound new concerns that the Department of Justice under Attorney General William Barr has lost its independence and become a vehicle for President Trump\u2019s political revenge,\u201d they said in a joint statement. \u201cIf the Department of Justice may be used as a tool of political retribution, or to help the President with a political narrative for the next election, the rule of law will suffer new and irreparable damage.\u201d\n\nAndrew Desiderio contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/54/1b/01af0c37449ea706614943dfa022/191024-bill-barr-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
