RFK would be embarrassed. RFK\u2019s a smart guy. Beto O\u2019Rourke is not.\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Reilly cited the many times that Mr. O\u2019Rourke, a former Texas congressman, has branded President Trump a racist and claimed the United States was founded on white supremacy. After the August mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, Mr. O\u2019Rourke claimed the shooter was inspired by the president\u2019s white nationalist rhetoric.\n\nMr. O\u2019Reilly said he has \u201cno respect\u201d for the way Mr. O\u2019Rourke has conducted himself on the campaign trail.\n\nHe said, \u201cAnybody that would support a man like Beto O\u2019Rourke has got to look in the mirror and say, \u2018Is that really what you want, somebody who would call somebody the most heinous names? Racist, misogynist, whatever it may be. Somebody who will accuse the president of the United States of inciting violence in El Paso.\u2019 This is just irresponsible stuff. I have no respect for him at all. The way he\u2019s conducted himself has been abysmal and he\u2019s not going anywhere. He\u2019s hurt himself. He will never be elected, in my opinion, to any [higher] office, ever.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, Mr. O\u2019Reilly said he liked Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg as the kind of measured politician the country needs right now.\n\n\u201cI like him,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he\u2019s sincere. He\u2019s not a phony. I think that he\u2019s got a future in Democratic politics. He\u2019s in over his head now, but come on, he\u2019s a small-town mayor. Articulate, well-meaning, so he\u2019s the kind of politician that I think the country needs. I don\u2019t agree with him on some things but I don\u2019t agree with most politicians on some things. But I think he\u2019s sincere and I think he has a future.\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Reilly, who was fired from Fox News in 2017 amid several sexual harassment allegations, is promoting his new book, \u201cThe United States of Trump: How the President Really Sees America,\u201d which is already a No. 1 best-seller on Amazon.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
