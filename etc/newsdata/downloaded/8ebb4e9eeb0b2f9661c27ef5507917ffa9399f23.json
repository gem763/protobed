The 43-year-old duly converted his advantage in the rain-delayed Zozo Championship in Japan on Monday and so celebrated equalling Sam Snead\u2019s record of 82 wins on the PGA Tour.\n\nAdam Scott, the former world No 1, spoke for everyone in the game when saying: \u201cTiger never ceases to amaze.\u201d This was Woods\u2019 first event in nine weeks and his first since a fifth knee operation, but he shrugged off the rust in emphatic style for his first title since his Masters resurrection in April.\n\nA 67 gave him a 19-under total and a three-shot victory in Tokyo over local favourite Hideki Matsuyama, with Rory McIlroy three shots further back in third. When Woods was in the midst of his back problems a few years ago, Snead\u2019s mark seemed to be safe, along with Jack Nicklaus\u2019s record major haul of 18.\n\nYet now, with the spinal fusion such a success and his most recent procedure also looking like it has given him fresh impetus, everything in the immortality stakes is all up for grabs again.\n\n\"Well, it's a big number,'' Woods said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I would ever play again. I was just hoping to be able to walk normal again. To be able to go through all that to get to where I\u2019m at now, I\u2019m very appreciative. I know how it feels to have this game, you know, what I felt like, taken away from me, where I couldn\u2019t participate in the way that I wanted to. Just so happy and so fortunate to be able to have this opportunity again.", "description": "Tiger Woods is back on the history trail.", "authors": ["James Corrigan", "Golf Correspondent"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
