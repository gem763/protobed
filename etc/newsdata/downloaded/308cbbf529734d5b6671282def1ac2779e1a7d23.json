No admissions of wrongdoing on the part of the SFA or those of us who felt his time was up.\n\nA 2-2 draw with Slovenia in October 2017 ended hopes of reaching the World Cup Finals and, after watching England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland reach Euro 2016 while Scotland watched on TV, the SFA board decided the time was right for a change.\n\nJohn McGinn scored a first half hat-trick as Scotland beat San Marino in a Euro 2020 qualifier\n\nThe Aston Villa midfielder was in inspired form as Scotland bounced back from losing to Russia\n\nMcGinn is congratulated by team-mate Liam Palmer after opening the scoring vs San Marino\n\nStatistics can be deceptive. Yet the facts and figures of the last two years bear out an old saying when it comes to changing a manager. Be careful what you wish for.\n\nWhen Strachan went Scotland were unbeaten in seven games. They were unbeaten in 2017 In came Alex McLeish and that didn't work. Steve Clarke replaced him in the 18 games played in the last two years Scotland's national team have now won seven. Two of them against the footballing giants of San Marino.\n\nListen, Steve Clarke will take a win wherever he can find one. His second in six games in charge was highlighted by a first half hat-trick for John McGinn. The former Hibs player became the first Scotland international to score three goals in the same half since Easter Road icon Laurie Reilly claimed a treble against the USA in 1952.\n\nThe second half was a slightly farcical affair as tumbling rain formed puddles on the Hampden pitch.\n\nThe misery was relieved by goals for two starting debutants, Lawrence Shankland tapping in the fourth before Stuart Findlay became defender Stuart Findlay became the first Kilmarnock player to score for Scotland since Tommy McLean against Wales in a 5-3 win in 1969. Substitute Stuart Armstrong added a late sixth with a stunning free-kick.\n\nMcGinn demonstrated impressive composure as he managed to score on three occasions\n\nMcGinn celebrates with his delighted Scotland team-mates after the first goal\n\nThere's no reason to hang out the bunting just yet. Far from moving in the right direction since dispensing with Strachan Scotland have gone backwards and a thumping one sided win over the no hopers of Europe in farcical conditions does nothing to change the task in hand.\n\nBefore he was also put out with the trash McLeish secured a Nations League play-off. And, with automatic qualification for the Euro 2020 finals gone, Clarke's task is to forge a team capable of beating the Norway side which claimed an injury time point against Spain on Saturday night in the final three group games.\n\nOn a dark, sodden night in Glasgow's south side there was never much doubt Scotland would win. The question was by how many.\n\nWhen they won 2-0 in San Marino in the dying days of the McLeish reign the Tartan Army made their feelings known. After a 4-0 defeat to Russia on Thursday the dreadful weather was a poor incentive to pay almost \u00a330 for a dead rubber game against the continental minnows.\n\nMATCH FACTS Scotland: McLaughlin; Palmer, Devlin, Findlay, Robertson; McTominay, McGregor (Russell 70); Christie, McGinn (Armstrong 70), Forrest; Shankland Subs: Fraser, Taylor, MacGillivray, Morgan, Gallagher, Mulgrew, Marshall, O'Donnell Goals: McGinn 12, 27, 45, Shankland 65, Findlay 70, Armstrong 86 Booked: McTominay San Marino: Simoncini; Battistini, Censoni, Brolli, D'Addario (Grandoni 46); Mularoni, A. Golinucci; Gasperoni, Berardi (Ceccaroli 80), Giardi (Hirsch 46); Nanni Subs not used: Zavoli, Lunadei, E. Golinucci, Bernardi, Benedettini, Tomassini, Valle, Palazzi Booked: Giardi\n\nYet a higher crowd than expected braved the elements to see Scotland do the needful. If there is no credit to be drawn from beating a team thrashed 9-0 by Belgium, some solace can be taken from the fact there was no shame either. And it's not often Scotland can say that.\n\nThe goal came in 12 minutes, the first of three for John McGinn despite legitimate grounds for doubt.\n\nRyan Christie and James Forrest, omitted from the loss to Russia, played either side of Shankland in a 4-3-3 formation.\n\nIn his ninth cap Christie will feel he claimed his first Scotland goal when he gathered a diagonal ball on the edge of the area, cut inside and curled a low effort towards the bottom corner.\n\nJohn McGinn's late run certainly distracted Simonici enough to see the ball creep into the net. Whether the Aston Villa man actually touched it en route is a moot point.\n\nA scorer in the 2-1 defeat to Russia at Hampden last month the former Hibs player was given the benefit of the doubt.\n\nThere was no argument over the second goal in 27 minutes. No scope for dubiety.\n\nMcGinn added his second goal of the game in the 27th minute at Hampden Park\n\nLawrence Shankland made it 4-0 to Scotland with his first ever goal at international level\n\nThe torrential rain tumbling from a leaden Glasgow sky made for treacherous handling conditions for San Marino keeper Simonici and it showed when he spilled a harmless Scott McTominay cross straight at the feet of McGinn for a tap-in. By Scotland standards a third goal in 19 caps makes the former Hibs man prolific.\n\nFor Scotland the menace came not from San Marino, but from the weather. After days of fretting over the impact conditions might have on the World Cup hopes of the national team Typhoon Haggis put in an appearance over Hampden, the ball visibly holding up in pools of water on the pitch.\n\nNevertheless, McGinn claimed a rare and precious Scotland hat-trick before half-time.\n\nRyan Christie's corner was headed towards goal by Stuart Findlay, Scotland's number eight spinning and thumping the ball into the net from close range for 3-0.\n\nThe second half begun to conditions better suited to synchronised swimming. Despite almost no bounce on the ball on the sodden surface French referee Jerome Brisard clearly took the view that it made more sense to plough on. Almost literally.\n\nThe sheer difficulty of passing the ball did nothing for hopes of more Scotland goals, the water on the pitch making the art of passing the ball a farcical lottery.\n\nA deflected Andrew Robertson cross almost caught out Simonici while, at the other end, Scotland's debutant keeper Jon McLaughlin finally had a save to make - his first of the game - from Filippo Berardi after an hour. For Scotland's keeper the greater threat was pneumonia.\n\nStuart Findlay marked his international debut with a goal in the 67th minute of the game\n\nStuart Armstrong's well-struck free-kick in the closing stages completed the scoring\n\nThe interest of the crowd was resurrected by the debutants taking centre stage. Shankland claimed his first Scotland goal after 65 minutes, tapping home from close range after Scott McTominay's rasping 25 yard curling shot careered off the crossbar and dropped favourable at the striker's feet.\n\nWithin three minutes it was Stuart Findlay's turn, the Kilmarnock defender's delight obvious as he firmly headed Ryan Christie's corner kick into the net for 5-0.\n\nMore accustomed to losing goals from corners the sight of Scotland scoring one for a change was welcome.\n\nJohnny Russell and Stuart Armstrong replaced Callum McGregor and the hat-trick hero McGinn, the Southampton midfielder making his mark with a stunning curling free-kick into the top corner for 6-0 with three minutes to play.\n\nA point behind a Cyprus side beaten by Russia, victory in Nicosia next month would elevate the Scots to third in Group I with a home game against Kazakhstan to finish. After two years of going in the wrong direction, it's something.", "description": "STEPHEN MCGOWAN AT HAMPDEN PARK:  John McGinn scored a first half hat-trick as Scotland beat San Marino 6-0 at Hampden Park in their latest Euro 2020 qualifier.", "authors": ["Stephen Mcgowan For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/19/19662376-0-image-a-2_1570989732772.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
