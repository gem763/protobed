Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, told House impeachment investigators Tuesday that the White House transcript of a July call between President Donald Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president omitted crucial words and phrases, and that his attempts to include them failed, according to three people familiar with the testimony.\n\nThe omissions, Vindman said, included Trump\u2019s assertion that there were recordings of former Vice President Joe Biden discussing Ukraine corruption, and an explicit mention by Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, of Burisma Holdings, the energy company whose board employed Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\nVindman, who appeared on Capitol Hill wearing his dark blue Army dress uniform and military medals, told House impeachment investigators that he tried to change the reconstructed transcript made by the White House staff to reflect the omissions. But while some of his edits appeared to have been successful, he said, those two corrections were not made.\n\nVindman did not testify to a motive behind the editing process. But his testimony is likely to drive investigators to ask further questions about how officials handled the call, including changes to the transcript and the decision to put it into the White House\u2019s most classified computer system \u2014 and whether those moves were meant to conceal the conversation\u2019s most controversial aspects.\n\nThe phrases do not fundamentally change lawmakers\u2019 understanding of the call, which was first reported by the CIA whistleblower whose complaint set off the impeachment inquiry. There are plenty of other examples of Trump referring to Ukraine-related conspiracy theories and asking for investigations of the Biden family. But Vindman\u2019s account offered a hint to solving a mystery surrounding the conversation: what Trump\u2019s aides left out of the transcript in places where ellipses indicated dropped words.\n\nIn hours of questioning Tuesday by Democrats and Republicans, Vindman recounted his alarm at the July 25 call, saying he \u201cdid not think it was proper\u201d for Trump to have asked Zelenskiy to investigate a political rival, and how White House officials struggled to deal with the fallout from a conversation he and others considered problematic.\n\nHis testimony about the reconstructed transcript, the aftermath of the call and a shadow foreign policy being run outside the National Security Council came as Democrats unveiled plans for a more public phase of the impeachment process. They plan to vote Thursday to direct the Intelligence Committee to conduct public hearings and produce a report for the Judiciary Committee to guide its consideration of impeachment articles. The measure will also provide a mechanism for Republicans to request subpoenas for witnesses and give Trump\u2019s lawyers a substantive role in the Judiciary Committee\u2019s proceedings to mount a defense.\n\nSome lawmakers indicated Vindman would make a good candidate to appear again at a public hearing next month.\n\nIt is not clear why some of Vindman\u2019s changes were not made, but the decision by a White House lawyer to quickly lock down the reconstructed transcript subverted the normal process of handling such documents, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe note takers and voice recognition software used during the July 25 call had missed Zelenskiy saying the word \u201cBurisma,\u201d according to people briefed on the matter, but the reconstructed transcript does refer to \u201cthe company\u201d and suggests that the Ukrainian president is aware that it is of great interest to Trump.\n\nUkraine\u2019s prosecutor general, Zelenskiy said, according to the document, \u201cwill look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue.\u201d\n\nThe rough transcript also contains ellipses at three points where Trump is speaking. Vindman told investigators that at the point of the transcript where the third set of ellipses appears, Trump said there were tapes of Biden.\n\nTrump\u2019s mention of tapes is an apparent reference to Biden\u2019s comments at a January 2018 event about his effort to get Ukraine to force out its prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin. Supporters of Biden have said Shokin was widely criticized for his lax anti-corruption efforts. Republicans charge, without evidence, that Biden was trying to stop an investigation into his son.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- Lt. Col.
