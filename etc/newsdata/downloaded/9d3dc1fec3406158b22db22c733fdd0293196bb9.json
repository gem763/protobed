Richard Keating, Massachusetts Democrat and chairman of the committee\u2019s subcommittee on the environment.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Mr. Keating criticized the Trump administration\u2019s decision to pull out from the Paris Climate Agreement in 2017. At the time, President Trump said the pact would have hurt the U.S. economy without imposing meaningful limits on greater polluters such as China and India.\n\nAt the G-7 summit in France last month, Mr. Trump said that he won\u2019t allow the U.S. to squander its wealth of fossil fuels on the \u201cdreams\u201d of people who are concerned about climate change.\n\n\u201cThe one thing we don\u2019t have is time,\u201d Mr. Keating added. \u201cThis is a global issue, and the biggest polluters are going to need to make changes.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
