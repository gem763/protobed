Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said Sunday that he wants President Trump to let Senate leaders know what kind of gun control legislation he would be willing to sign.\n\nAmid several mass shootings in recent months, Blunt said that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., won\u2019t bring forth any legislation on gun control that Trump won\u2019t put his signature on.\n\n\u201cThe president needs to step up here and set some guidelines for what he would do,\u201d Blunt said during an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet The Press.\u201d \u201cI'm afraid what's going to happen here is what always happens, is we take this silly \u2018if we don't get everything, we won't do anything.\u2019\u201d\n\nNRA RIVALS SEE OPENING AS TURMOIL GRIPS NATION\u2019S BIGGEST GUN RIGHTS GROUP\n\nGun control legislation has been a hotly debated topic for decades in Congress, but has recently taken on a new urgency in the wake of a number of mass shootings across the country. In August, back-to-back mass shootings in Texas and Ohio left at least 31 people dead just days after another gunman opened fire at a festival in California, killing four and injuring 13 others. Last weekend, another gunman in Texas killed seven people and wounded more than 20 in a rampage between the cities of Odessa and Midland.\n\nBlunt said one area he thinks there is agreement on between Republicans and Democrats is finding a way to detect individuals with mental health issues and treat them earlier in the hopes of preventing more shootings.\n\n\u201cThere's a moment here where we can expand what we're already doing on that front,\u201d he said.\n\nAuthorities in Texas, however, said that despite failing a background check due to a mental health issue, the shooter in last weekend\u2019s slayings, Seth Aaron Ator, was able to obtain a gun by purchasing the weapon he used through a private transaction.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nUnder federal law, private sales of firearms \u2014 such as between friends, relatives or even strangers \u2014 are not required to undergo a federal background check. Some 21 states plus Washington, D.C., have laws that require background checks on some private sales, but Texas isn't one of them. Two other states \u2014 Maryland and Pennsylvania \u2014 require a background check for handguns but not long guns.\n\nBlunt argued that any expansion of background checks was something that the president probably wouldn\u2019t sign and thus off the table for the time being. Trump said earlier this year that he supported universal background checks, but has since walked back on the comment.\n\nThe Democratic-controlled House passed a universal background check bill in February, but the Republican-majority Senate has not called it to a vote.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Sen.
