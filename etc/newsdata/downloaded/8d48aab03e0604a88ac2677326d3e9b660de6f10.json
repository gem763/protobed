We controlled the game and bossed possession.\n\n\u2018It was my first start and great to be back in the team but overall a disappointing result.\n\n\u2018We know we have a world-class team so it\u2019s about showing what we can do when things don\u2019t go our way.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s important we turn it around. We know how good we are, we just have to start showing it on the pitch.\u2019\n\nMORE: Mauricio Pochettino does not want any January signings and calls on his Tottenham squad to fight\n\nMORE: Former Tottenham coach Clive Allen recalls almost punching Arsene Wenger before Carlo Cudicini stepped in", "description": "Dele Alli admitted the relief was tangible after his controversial goal against Watford was allowed to stand.
