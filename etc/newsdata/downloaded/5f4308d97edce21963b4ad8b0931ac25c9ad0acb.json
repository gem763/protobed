(AP Photo/Matt York)\n\nIn a major blow to the NCAA\u2019s model of amateurism, the California bill that will allow college athletes to profit from their own name, image and likeness was signed into law Monday morning by Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nThe new law, which is backed by superstar athletes like LeBron James and staunchly opposed by the NCAA and collegiate athletic administrators across the country, will give NCAA athletes the opportunity to pursue endorsement deals once it goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2023.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe NCAA has long used its tax-exempt status and the concept of \u201camateurism\u201d to defend its rules that prohibit college athletes from being compensated in any way beyond their scholarships and cost-of-attendance. But once the law comes to fruition, college athletes in California will essentially be afforded the same endorsement opportunities provided to Olympic athletes. Money would not be coming from universities, but the law would allow athletes to hire an agent and pursue outside business deals without jeopardizing their eligibility. Athletes would also own the rights to use their names and images.\n\n\u201cSenate Bill 206 addresses an injustice in our higher education system,\u201d Newsom wrote to the California State Senate announcing his decision to sign the bill into law. \u201cOther college students with a talent, whether it be literature, music or technological innovation, can monetize their skill and hard work. Student-athletes, however, are prohibited from being compensated while their respective colleges and universities make millions, often at great risk to athletes\u2019 health, academics and professional careers.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cMoreover, due to their demanding academic and athletic schedules, student-athletes are typically unable to work a part-time job to help make ends meet. This bill simply and rightfully allows student-athletes to benefit from the multi-billion dollar enterprise of which they are the backbone.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m so incredibly proud to share this moment with all of you. @gavinnewsom came to The Shop to do something that will change the lives for countless athletes who deserve it! @uninterrupted hosted the formal signing for SB 206 allowing college athletes to responsibly get paid. pic.twitter.com/NZQGg6PY9d \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) September 30, 2019\n\nNCAA vehemently opposes this bill\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times, Newsom said that the law was a \u201cbig move to expose the farce and to challenge a system that is outsized in its capacity to push back.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery single student in the university can market their name, image and likeness; they can go and get a YouTube channel, and they can monetize that,\u201d Newsom told The New York Times. \u201cThe only group that can\u2019t are athletes. Why is that?\u201d\n\nSince the bill was in its infancy, the NCAA has been strongly against it. Back in June, NCAA president Mark Emmert sent a letter to California lawmakers implying that universities in the state could be barred from NCAA championships if the bill was entered into state law. Earlier this month, the NCAA said the bill is \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and would blur the line between professional and amateur athletics.\n\n\u201cIf the bill becomes law and California\u2019s 58 NCAA schools are compelled to allow an unrestricted name, image and likeness scheme, it would erase the critical distinction between college and professional athletics and, because it gives those schools an unfair recruiting advantage, would result in them eventually being unable to compete in NCAA competitions,\u201d the NCAA said Sept. 11.\n\nBack in May, the NCAA formed a working group to \u201cexamine issues related to student-athlete name, image and likeness.\u201d The NCAA hoped California would delay consideration from the bill until NCAA officials discussed the issue. A final report from the working group is due to the NCAA Board of Directors in October.\n\nNewsom, in his letter to the State Senate, said he is looking forward to \u201creviewing the recommendations\u201d of the NCAA working group. The commencement date of Jan. 1, 2023 was chosen deliberately to make adjustments that would address any \u201cunintended consequences\u201d that could arise.\n\n\u201cSB 206 provides a three-year implementation window. If unintended consequences arise that negatively impact our colleges and universities, or our student-athletes, my administration will work constructively with the Legislature to address these issues,\u201d Newsom wrote. \u201cUltimately, this is a fundamental matter of fairness and equity that is well past due.\u201d\n\nAfter the bill was signed on Monday morning, the NCAA released a statement saying that any changes made to its model should be done \u201con a national level.\u201d Below is the NCAA\u2019s full statement.\n\nAs a membership organization, the NCAA agrees changes are needed to continue to support student-athletes, but improvement needs to happen on a national level through the NCAA\u2019s rules-making process. Unfortunately, this new law already is creating confusion for current and future student-athletes, coaches, administrators and campuses, and not just in California.\n\nWe will consider next steps in California while our members move forward with ongoing efforts to make adjustments to NCAA name, image and likeness rules that are both realistic in modern society and tied to higher education.\n\nAs more states consider their own specific legislation related to this topic, it is clear that a patchwork of different laws from different states will make unattainable the goal of providing a fair and level playing field for 1,100 campuses and nearly half a million student-athletes nationwide.\n\nPac-12: Bill will have \u2018significant negative consequences\u2019\n\nLike the NCAA, the Pac-12 is against this bill. In a statement, the conference said it will \u201chave very significant negative consequences\u201d for the conference\u2019s student-athletes and \u201cwill lead to the professionalization of college sports.\u201d\n\nBelow is the conference\u2019s statement in its entirety:\n\nThe Pac-12 is disappointed in the passage of SB 206 and believes it will have very significant negative consequences for our student-athletes and broader universities in California. This legislation will lead to the professionalization of college sports and many unintended consequences related to this professionalism, imposes a state law that conflicts with national rules, will blur the lines for how California universities recruit student-athletes and compete nationally, and will likely reduce resources and opportunities for student-athletes in Olympic sports and have a negative disparate impact on female student-athletes.\n\nOur universities have led important student-athlete reform over the past years, but firmly believe all reforms must treat our student-athletes as students pursuing an education, and not as professional athletes. We will work with our universities to determine next steps and ensure continuing support for our student-athletes.\n\nNewsom: We had to force NCAA\u2019s hand\n\nNewsom told the Times that state officials felt the need to force the NCAA\u2019s hand on the issue.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to do the right thing on their own. They only do the right thing when they\u2019re sued or they\u2019re forced to do the right thing,\u201d Newsom said.\n\nIn recent months, legislators in other states, including South Carolina and New York, have spoken out in support of the California bill and voiced interest in pursuing similar legislation in their own states.\n\nMeanwhile, athletic administrators across the country are feeling uneasy. TCU athletic director Jeremiah Donati told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that the bill \u201cworries\u201d him \u201ca lot\u201d and that it could \u201cpotentially destroy everything we know and love about college sports.\u201d Ohio State athletic director Gene Smith said last week, before the bill was signed into law, that California schools \u201cwon\u2019t be members of the NCAA\u201d if the bill passed. Smith also said Ohio State would not schedule games against any teams from California.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "In a major blow to the NCAA\u2019s model of amateurism, California passed a bill that will allow college athletes to profit from their own name, image and likeness.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/_qDZU.XLcYziI8ocjvMMGA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_Uw1kyjswN3ZvVwalnkvlg--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-05/f14bfec0-6dd2-11e9-bdc7-3152916906dd", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
