In fact, he has used his platform to demonize America, trash the president, promote gun control legislation, and tout other social-justice issues. But this week, he said that NBA Houston Rockets executive Daryl Morey was only thinking about himself when he decided to tweet about supporting democracy and freedom in Hong Kong. Yes, LeBron argued that Morey was being selfish and not thinking about anybody else when he decided to use his freedom of speech to support thousands, if not millions, of Hong Kongers and Chinese citizens who want freedom from the tyrannical and abusive communist government.\n\nNow LeBron, as you may remember, previously got into a spat with Fox News' Laura Ingraham. Ingraham told LeBron to \"shut up and dribble\" after the basketball star said that President Trump \"doesn't give a f*ck about the people.\" LeBron responded by bravely tweeting #wewillnotshutupanddribble.\n\nBut now that LeBron is facing communist China and has millions of dollars on the line, the people be damned, it appears LeBron is going to shut up and dribble.\n\n\"I won\u2019t be talking about it again...we\u2019re not politicians, I think it\u2019s a huge political thing...it was a challenging trip for all of us in China,\" LeBron told media Wednesday night.\n\n.@KingJames on China/Hong Kong: \u201cI won\u2019t be talking about it again \u2026 we\u2019re not politicians, I think it\u2019s a huge political thing \u2026 it was a challenging trip for all of us in China.\u201d pic.twitter.com/w2gLb7BgnV \u2014 Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) October 16, 2019\n\nWhat LeBron, and the rest of the NBA for that matter, is doing is showing to Americans exactly why we should not listen to their words when it comes to politics in America. If they fail to get even a moral issue as black and white as supporting the people of Hong Kong versus the communist government, what validity do they have on any other issue?\n\nIt seems LeBron has helped the Hong Kongers in one way though. In order to get around facial recognition technology, so that the government cannot track down the protesters and punish them, it seems many protesters are using LeBron's face as a shield against cameras. Good for them. #FreeHongKong.\n\nHong Kong protestor spoofs facial recognition AI with LeBron\u2019s face and my respect for these guys just hit a whole new level pic.twitter.com/XIdKFSAEX5 \u2014 John Noonan (@noonanjo) October 16, 2019\n\nLeBron is no longer King James. He's now Chairman James because he kowtows to communist China.", "description": ".10/16/2019 16:32:07PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Bronson Stocking", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/289/6c3045d2-2b50-4947-946f-e6fe62103a69.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
