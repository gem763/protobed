It was the beginning of a precautionary but highly disruptive blackout that could eventually affect more than 2 million people and last for days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAmong the residents now without electricity are many who lived through the Camp Fire in 2018 and the Tubbs Fire, which tore through wine country two years ago. And for them, this week\u2019s grim forecasts and red-flag warnings recalled the conditions in the region during those two wildfires.\n\nPG&E has called the effort \u2014 which is the most extensive planned power outage ever employed \u2014 a last resort. It\u2019s a Hail Mary move, an attempt to avoid more wildfires sparked by the company\u2019s power lines, which have already forced it into bankruptcy in the face of billions of dollars in liability claims.\n\nBut for Californians, if feels like a new, unacceptable normal.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s what they need to do to keep us safe, I understand it,\u201d said Boutelle, who now lives a few miles west in Chico. \u201cBut ultimately, something needs to happen. They need to get their act together. We can\u2019t live like this. This is crazy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMary Saip\u2019s family was one of the first to move back to Paradise. On Wednesday, she had to power her house by generator.\n\n\u201cThe anger comes from the fear of powerlessness,\u201d she said. \u201cIf this is what the future holds, I don\u2019t want to live here.\u201d\n\nSaip and her husband, Ravi, said they felt PG&E was overreacting, trying to shirk responsibility while passing costs along to communities forced to deal with outages.\n\n\u201cWe went through the fire. We\u2019ve been through hell and back,\u201d Ravi Saip said. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re being penalized for living in our home. This can\u2019t be your solution.\u201d\n\nThe fact that PG&E chose to roll out the tactic this year but balked last year frustrates the couple even more. The night before the Camp Fire, the utility began notifying its customers that their power was likely to be shut off due to \u201cincreasing fire risk.\u201d Yet the next day, as winds raged and the wildfire grew, the power stayed on \u2014 until the flames took it out.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWinds were really powerful that day and nobody would\u2019ve complained if they shut the grids down that morning,\u201d said Ravi Saip. \u201cNow I expect there to be really horrendous winds for them to shut the power off.\u201d\n\nBut as of Wednesday evening, winds hadn\u2019t yet whipped up as predicted, leaving some simmering with anger at the utility for cutting the power and others stewing in quiet anxiety, knowing how quickly a fire can spread and never feeling secure.\n\nThe National Weather Service cautioned that just because winds haven\u2019t picked up yet, it doesn\u2019t mean residents are in the clear. An agency meteorologist warned, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the wind is coming.\u201d\n\nThe utility is working to update and improve its lines and other infrastructure, fortifying it against these types of gusts, said Sumeet Singh, a PG&E vice president. But until then, he said, its customers can expect more of these shutdowns, unless weather patterns change significantly.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDealing with wildfires is the new abnormal in California,\u201d Singh said at a Wednesday news conference. \u201cThis is something, from my perspective, that we have to work together to find the right solution set for.\"\n\nSanta Rosa Mayor Tom Schwedhelm knows a lot of his residents are furious about the outage \u2014 emails from them have been trickling into his inbox all day, and he\u2019s expecting more once his city gets its power back. But until then, he said he understands why PG&E is hedging against catastrophe.\n\nThe risk isn\u2019t worth it, he said, and he knows that firsthand.\n\nTwo years ago, nearly to the day, the Tubbs Fire ripped through Santa Rosa, destroying 2,900 homes. Schwedhelm\u2019s own neighborhood was ravaged, though his house survived.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWalking through my neighborhood in October 2017, it was devastating,\u201d he said. \u201cExperiencing that, I wouldn\u2019t want anyone else to go through it. Whatever we can do so no one has to go through something like that, I\u2019m for it. The intention is right.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut on the second anniversary, emotions are still raw. At the time, it was the state\u2019s deadliest fire, killing 22, and now is surpassed only by the Camp Fire, which killed 85. On Schwedhelm\u2019s street, five houses were destroyed and are still in various states of repair. One man, he said, is still living in a trailer on his lot.\n\nHe shares his neighbors\u2019 frustrations, he said, but the county is dealing with a state of emergency, and residents should focus on their safety.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn the middle of a state of emergency is not the time to start pointing figures,\u201d Schwedhelm said. \u201cLet\u2019s get through this and then hold PG&E accountable.\u201d\n\nOne change he said he\u2019d like to see is moving away from aboveground power lines, a system he characterized as a dangerous relic.\n\n\u201cLook at all the technological advances \u2014 heck, we\u2019re getting driverless cars \u2014 yet we still have live power lines on top of wood poles?\u201d Schwedhelm said. \u201cI think we can do some work on that.\u201d\n\nCalifornia fire officials cleared PG&E of wrongdoing in the Tubbs Fire, but the utility\u2019s equipment was blamed for starting more than a dozen other wine country fires that burned in counties across the North Bay Area \u2014 including Sonoma County, where David Rabbitt chairs the board of supervisors.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe said both the company and local and state governments should bear the responsibility of building a sustainable, safe electric grid.\n\nIn counties like Rabbitt\u2019s, prolonged outages can leave vintners, ranchers and farmers, small restaurants and corner groceries facing millions of dollars in lost business.\n\nThey\u2019re disruptive and they\u2019re costly, and they can\u2019t be the way of the future. But when he thinks about the past, and the blazes that could have been avoided, he wishes the utility took the same measures then.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, if we had a power outage on this day two years ago and avoided what we went through,\u201d Rabbitt said, \u201cwe\u2019d all be celebrating.\u201d\n\nScott Wilson in California contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "This week\u2019s grim forecasts and red-flag warnings recalled the conditions in the region during those two wildfires.", "authors": ["Reis Thebault", "National", "Breaking News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/e35Do_ZRy57c2ZkdGDNAYVHFRIE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FNICIIHK2MI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
