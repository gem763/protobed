Weeks ago, police captured Francisco in Texas and extradited him to Rhode Island.\n\nNewly reported details of the case by the Providence Journal\u2018s Brian Amaral and Katie Mulvaney reveal that almost immediately after Francisco was freed by the First Step Act, he returned to a drug-fueled life that had originally put him in prison.\n\n\u2018Latin Kings\u2019 Gang Leader Freed by \u2018First Step Act\u2019 Arrested for Murder After Nationwide Manhunthttps://t.co/ZMReawaet3 \u2014 John Binder \ud83d\udc7d (@JxhnBinder) October 25, 2019\n\nFrancisco was originally convicted in 2005 for dealing crack cocaine and powder cocaine. Days after his release by the First Step Act in February, drug records reveal he returned to using cocaine.\n\nIn February, days after his release, Francisco tested positive for cocaine. Then, months later in June, Francisco tested positive for marijuana three times. Weeks later, Francisco was charged with attempting to break into his ex-girlfriend\u2019s home.\n\nOn September 23, Francisco again tested positive for cocaine. Days later, on October 2, police said Francisco stabbed Pine to death. Francisco had violated his terms of release six times within the first year of being freed by the First Step Act.\n\nIn November 2018, Breitbart News reported that the First Step Act would result in the release of thousands of drug traffickers from prison despite their dealing deadly drugs such as fentanyl and heroin. A report this year by Fox News\u2019s Tucker Carlson stated that the First Step Act had successfully released about 240 sex offenders, nearly 60 convicted murderers and assailants, as well as almost 1,000 inmates convicted of drug crimes.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
