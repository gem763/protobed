(Dayna Smith for The Washington Post)\n\nA former analyst for the FBI admitted Tuesday to copying the private emails of a conservative conspiracy theorist and sharing them with his superiors while his wife offered them to the press.\n\nMark Tolson, 60, pleaded guilty in federal court in Alexandria, Va., to one misdemeanor count of accessing without authorization the email account of lobbyist Jack Burkman. Burkman is identified in the court documents by the initials \u201cJ.B.\u201d\n\nTolson\u2019s wife, Sarah Gilbert Fox, worked for Burkman from October 2017 to early summer 2018 and had access to his email, according to a statement of facts. Tolson learned in October that Burkman, who gained prominence for conspiracy theories about the death of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich, was planning a news conference claiming that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III committed sexual assault. The woman never appeared, and Mueller asked the FBI to examine claims that she was offered money to fabricate the accusation. Burkman has denied offering anyone money for testimony.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Tolson asked his wife to see whether she still had access to Burkman\u2019s account, and they spent 15 or 20 minutes reviewing, photographing and printing \u201cemails of interest.\u201d When they tried to log in again, they were denied access.\n\nFox and Tolson both then contacted a reporter to share the information and offered to provide Burkman\u2019s password. The reporter declined to accept the password.\n\nOn Nov. 1, 2018, Tolson emailed an FBI official to request a meeting on an \u201curgent\u201d matter, according to the statement of facts. They met later that day, and Tolson handed over an envelope containing the emails, which he believed might be \u201cillegal.\u201d\n\nBurkman\u2019s partner in the Mueller stunt, a young conservative operative named Jacob Wohl, was recently charged with a felony in California in connection with a house-flipping scheme. Burkman was also the victim of another crime related to his conspiratorial work; last year a man he hired to investigate Rich\u2019s death shot and nearly killed him after a falling out.\n\nTolson, who has left the FBI, agreed to forfeit two phones and two computers and avoid contact with Burkman, his neighbor in Arlington. He was released on bond until sentencing on Dec. 20. The charge carries a maximum sentence of one year.\n\nTolson\u2019s attorney declined to comment on the case, as did spokespeople for the FBI and the Eastern District of Virginia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very sad,\u201d Burkman said Tuesday. \u201cI feel sorry for his family. Let\u2019s hope there is significant jail time here.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\n\u2018Aryan\u2019 and \u2018Octoroon\u2019: Couples challenge racial labels to get married in Virginia\n\nNew survey shows heavy psychological toll for Virginia\u2019s first responders\n\nA disproportionate number of police stops involved African Americans\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Mark Tolson pleaded guilty in federal court to unauthorized computer access, a misdemeanor.", "authors": ["Rachel Weiner", "Local Reporter Covering Federal Court In Alexandria", "Va.", "Local Court In Arlington", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ga1PdRDagtsRCXegoFYKWCLRAwI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P5H224DWLQI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
