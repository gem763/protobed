Milwaukee won, meaning the Brewers are now tied with the Cubs for the final playoff spot in the National League.\n\nDarvish finished with 13 strikeouts in 7 innings Tuesday night, but gave up all 4 Reds runs.\n\nIt makes back-to-back incredible performances from the veteran in the whiff department, as he has 27 strikeouts over his last two starts - second-best in Cubs history:\n\nStory continues\n\nYu Darvish struck out 8 straight Reds hitters tonight, the longest single-game streak in Cubs history.\n\n\n\nOver his last 2 starts, Darvish has struck out 27. The only Cubs pitcher since 1900 with more K over a 2-game span was Kerry Wood (both ends of 20-K game). pic.twitter.com/frydOLrgLY\n\n\n\n\u2014 ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) September 18, 2019\n\n\"I'm in a pretty good place [right now], but still, we lost,\" he said. \"We need wins at this point, so I'm still frustrated.\"\n\nAs the Cubs make their push toward October, Darvish has been right up there with Kyle Hendricks as the most reliable members of the rotation.\n\nGiven the way last year went and his slow start to 2019, the Cubs could not have asked for more from Darvish in the second half of the season while also pitching through some forearm tightness. Since the All-Star Break, the 33-year-old right-hander has a 2.70 ERA, 0.80 WHIP and 106 strikeouts against only 7 walks in 73.1 innings.\n\nHis performance has been especially huge since veterans Cole Hamels and Jon Lester have struggled to find consistency over the last couple months.\n\n\"We're seeing the real version of [Darvish] as a person, not just as a baseball player,\" Cubs pitching coach Tommy Hottovy said before Tuesday's game. \"I think the comfortability level of him with everybody - the media, the coaching staff, the city, every aspect of it has played into it.\n\n\"When he's in a good place and he's mentally feeling good and physically feeling good and he's comfortable, the sky's the limit with him and what he can do. He's got the freedom here to be more of himself in that we don't put a lot of restrictions on him and what he wants to do. As long as we kinda have the same focus and same goals, we're all on the same team.\n\n\"I feel like he's getting to the point now where he's himself. You see that every time out. He's an ultra competitor; he's an uber planner. His routines are outstanding. He's just ready to go out there and dominate every time he gets the ball.\"\n\nYu Darvish makes history, but Cubs lose crucial game originally appeared on NBC Sports Chicago", "description": "Yu Darvish recovered to etch his name in Cubs history books Tuesday night, but the Cubs missed a golden opportunity to gain ground in the playoff race.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Zw6lb4ewV9Zw_ahQHxvBBw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8Tdsv0jVYEnSzl2iyjCkyg--~B/aD02NDg7dz0xMTUyO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnchicago.com/891fb7ccb9d01af09d8cd6dd01b097f4", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
