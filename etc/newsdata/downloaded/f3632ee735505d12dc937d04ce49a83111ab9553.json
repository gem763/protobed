As a result, the appeal must fail.\"\n\namaBhungane previously reported that Sassa and then chief executive officer Virginia Petersen, at the time accepted the CPS claim at face value and paid the R316m.", "description": "The Supreme Court of Appeal has ordered Cash Paymaster Services to pay back an amount of R316m back to the South African Social Services Agency.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9344/84c0a3da4ca54526b22009b3dd26484c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
