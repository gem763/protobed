Then the protests got weird.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nKim Whitley holds her granddaughter Kole, 3, on Sept. 9 while protesting California's new legislation to tighten the rules on giving exemptions for vaccinations. (Rich Pedroncelli/AP)\n\nAnti-vaccine activists in California area heatedly protesting new limits on medical exemptions to vaccine requirements days after the bill was finalized amid a nationwide crisis of confidence in the life-saving procedure.\n\nFirst, protesters blocked the entrance to the state capitol Monday and repeatedly shut down the legislature with their demonstrations as Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed the bill, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\n\nThen, a candlelight vigil Wednesday for children allegedly harmed or killed by vaccines included a photo of Ethan Lindenberger, who was vaccinated against his parents\u2019 wishes and has testified before Congress. Jonathan Lockwood, executive director of the anti-vaccine group Conscience Coalition, which organized the vigil, did not immediately respond to a question about why the photo was used.\n\nThe state legislative session closed Friday with a dramatic display from the gallery: A woman threw \u201ca feminine hygiene device containing what appeared to be blood\u201d at the senators from a balcony, the California Highway Patrol said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s for the dead babies!\u201d she shouted as people gasped.\n\nThe tension comes as a wave of hesitancy about vaccines washes over some parents. Although vaccines prevent 2 million to 3 million deaths each year, the World Health Organization says many parents hesitate to vaccinate their children out of complacency, the inconvenience of accessing vaccines and a lack of confidence in vaccines\u2019 effectiveness.\n\n[Jessica Biel lobbied alongside a prominent anti-vaxxer but says she supports vaccines]\n\nCalifornia\u2019s bill, SB 276, creates a standardized medical exemption request form to be approved by the state\u2019s public health officer. It also authorizes the health department to review requests for medical exemptions at schools where less than 95 percent of students are vaccinated, at schools that do not report their vaccination rates and from doctors who have written five or more waivers in a given year.\n\nThe woman who threw what the Sacramento Bee reports was a menstrual cup on Friday walked out of the chamber and into the hallway, where police said she was arrested on charges including assault and vandalism. \u201cI\u2019m doing this for the babies that died, so their voices can be heard,\u201d the woman, identified as 43-year-old Rebecca Dalelio, said as she was being arrested. \u201c... Their blood is on your hands, you who make the laws.\u201d\n\nThree hours after the disruption, the senators met in a conference room to finish the legislative session. Sen. Steve Glazer (D-7th Dist.) wrote on Twitter that the Senate floor \u201cremains a crime scene.\u201d He tweeted a photo of himself at a doctor\u2019s appointment Saturday as a safety precaution because he was potentially exposed to blood.\n\n\u201cStill absorbing it all. But as my hat says Relax!\" Glazer wrote. \"Thankful that none of my Senate colleagues appear hurt and we finished our work.\u201d\n\n[\u2018He is wrong\u2019: Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s family calls him out for anti-vaccine conspiracy theories]\n\nSen. Scott Wiener (D-11th Dist.) wrote that anti-vaccine activists had \u201cengaged in a harassment campaign all week\u201d and that the red liquid had hit several of his colleagues.\n\n\u201cThese anti-vaxxers are engaging in criminal behavior,\" he wrote. \"They\u2019ve now repeatedly assaulted Senators & are engaging in harassing & intimidating behavior every single day, as we try to do the people\u2019s work. They\u2019re a cancer on the body politic & are attacking democracy.\u201d\n\nSenate Republican leader Shannon Grove, who had opposed the vaccine bill, joined her Democratic colleagues in condemning the incident.\n\n\u201cRegardless of differences of opinions, there\u2019s no place for this in our America,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe debate over the bill was mired in other drama this summer. An anti-vaccine activist was arrested in August for allegedly shoving one of the bill\u2019s sponsors and live-streaming the encounter on Facebook. Actress Jessica Biel, known for her role on the series \u201c7th Heaven,\u201d made headlines in June for lobbying at the California capitol with prominent anti-vaccination activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nThe United States this year experienced an outbreak of measles, which health officials believe worsened because anti-vaccine groups spread misinformation that lowered vaccination rates in vulnerable communities. The Orthodox Jewish community in New York City was hit by a particularly high number of cases.\n\nRead more:\n\nDrug companies seek removal of judge in landmark opioid case\n\nAuthor paints grim portrait of U.S. health care and our soaring medical debt.
