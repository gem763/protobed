(GeekWire Photo / Alan Boyle)\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos says his Blue Origin space venture is heading up a team of top space companies \u2014 including Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper \u2014 to build a landing system to take NASA astronauts to the moon as early as 2024.\n\n\u201cThis is a national team for a national priority,\u201d Bezos said here at the International Astronautical Congress, where he received the International Astronomical Federation\u2019s first Excellence in Industry Award on Blue Origin\u2019s behalf.\n\nBlue Origin would serve as the prime contractor for the lander project, with its Blue Moon lander serving as the heart of the system.\n\nBezos said Northrop Grumman, which built the lunar lander for the Apollo program a half-century ago, would be responsible for the orbital transfer vehicle that would take astronauts from a moon-orbiting Gateway platform to a lower lunar orbit.\n\nLockheed Martin, the prime contractor for NASA\u2019s Orion deep-space capsule, would build the ascent module that would sit atop the Blue Moon lander and bring the astronauts back from the lunar surface.\n\nAnd Draper, which worked on avionics for Apollo, would work on the descent guidance system and flight avionics.\n\nBlue Origin executives said that the system has been proposed for NASA\u2019s use under the terms of the space agency\u2019s NextSTEP-2 Appendix H solicitation. NASA is expected to select at least a couple of landing systems for further development in January. The systems that are selected would serve as key elements in NASA\u2019s Artemis program to send \u201cthe first woman and the next man\u201d to the lunar surface in as little as five years.\n\nIn May, Bezos unveiled a mockup of the Blue Moon lander and revealed that his privately held space company was working on a hydrogen-fueled BE-7 engine to provide propulsion. During this week\u2019s congress, the mockup has been set up at the same convention center where Bezos made the big reveal.\n\nGreat to see the #BlueMoon lunar lander on display at the @IAC2019DC; looking forward to a week of informative meetings, plenaries, papers, and presentations #IAC2019 pic.twitter.com/azT4Ewknw8 \u2014 A.C.
