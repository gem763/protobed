The article below by The Conversation covers the outcome of the international court ruling on the couple's case.\n\nBlood is thicker than water, or so the saying goes, reflecting the value we put on biological relationships. But is it something the law should recognise?\n\n\n\nSingapore\u2019s Supreme Court recently ruled on a case that asks this very question, and it gave a fascinating answer: parents have a strong interest in \u201cgenetic affinity\u201d with their children, one that can merit compensation if subverted.\n\nGenetic affinity is an entirely new legal standard. It has no clear precedent in any jurisdiction. But the court made a compelling argument that it has a sound basis in the way we value family and heredity.\n\nRecognising that value will be particularly important as we advance into the genomic era, which will increase our ability to not only analyse but also alter our fundamental biological code.\n\nACB v Thomson Medical\n\nThe case in question involves an unfortunate mix-up. A couple underwent in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) at Thomson Medical Centre in Singapore. The process was successful, and the mother gave birth to a healthy baby girl (her second child via IVF) in 2010.\n\nBut the happy parents soon noticed that their daughter had markedly different features, including hair and skin tone, compared with them and their first child.\n\nA genetic test found that the child was related only to the mother, not the mother\u2019s husband. Thomson Medical confirmed a mistake had been made; an anonymous donor\u2019s sperm, rather than the husband\u2019s sperm, had accidentally been used to inseminate the mother\u2019s egg.\n\nThe couple sued Thomson Medical, seeking damages including the child\u2019s upkeep through to the age of 21. The case wound its way through the courts, eventually ending up before the Supreme Court, which issued a final ruling on March 2.\n\nUpkeep and genetic affinity\n\nThe court denied the couple\u2019s claim for upkeep costs because it would have a pernicious effect in that the child\u2019s birth would be seen as an overall mistake, or loss to the parents.\n\nThe parents are raising the child, and an award would send a perverse and harmful message to the child that she was not valued, that her very existence required monetary compensation.\n\nThis reasoning has led many courts to deny \u201cwrongful birth\u201d upkeep claims. Such claims typically come up when someone parents a child after a botched voluntary sterilisation operation.\n\nIt was also the basis of Andrews v Keltz, a New York State Supreme Court \u201cwrongful fertilisation\u201d case involving a similar sperm mix-up.\n\nSingapore\u2019s Supreme Court was clearly dissatisfied with that outcome. It felt that the couple had suffered a very serious harm, one not captured by current common law.\n\nSo the court created a completely new category of loss \u2013 genetic affinity. It held that parents have a strong interest in being genetically related to their children, and that Thomson Medical had violated this interest.\n\nIronically, the court did set the award for loss of genetic affinity at 30% of upkeep costs to the couple in the end. This was not because upkeep itself was a loss to be compensated; it was because there seemed no other principled way to settle the financial value of genetic affinity.\n\nAwarding a portion of upkeep was at least less arbitrary than an absolute award. At the same time, it may raise the concern that the value of genetic affinity has greater monetary weight for rich parents, who have higher upkeep costs, than poor parents.\n\nThe value of genetic affinity\n\nMore fundamentally, the case raises the question of whether there\u2019s really a value in genetic affinity. The court relied, in part, on an obscure 1999 law review article by New York University law academic Fred Norton. In it, he argues that \u201cparents have an interest in having children with whom they share symbolically identifying traits\u201d.\n\nBut Norton\u2019s argument is problematic because it is skin deep. He focuses on traits like appearance as grounding the interest in genetic affinity. This implies that the harm involved in the case was not about the misplaced sperm as such, but about certain superficial features of the misplaced sperm.\n\nIn ACB v Thomson Medical, the couple were of Chinese and German heritage, while the genetic father was of Indian heritage. If the genetic father had \u2013 by chance \u2013 also been of Chinese or German heritage (or both), would there have been a loss of genetic affinity?\n\nNorton\u2019s argument gives no reason for thinking so. Yet there\u2019s something very disturbing about this. Is the value of a familial relationship reducible to a set of superficial appearances or traits?\n\nA more sound moral basis for the value of genetic affinity would go much deeper. It would hold that genetic affinity isn\u2019t just about appearances; it\u2019s about consciously choosing to create a child by a mixing of this mother\u2019s egg with this father\u2019s sperm, producing a child with half the DNA of each parent.\n\nSociety and individuals place great value on such biological relationships. Genetic affinity \u2013 rather than appearance \u2013 grounds a parent\u2019s obligation to pay child support, for instance. And men who suspect their spouses of cheating on them often care deeply about whether their children are really theirs.\n\nThe court supports this deeper value at various points in ACB v Thomson Medical, and it is quite compelling when it does so.\n\nIt\u2019s careful to note, though, that genetic affinity is not an absolute value. Adoptive parenting relationships should be lauded, not devalued. But adoption\u2019s value derives in part from its consensual nature.\n\nWhen parents are denied genetic affinity with their child against their will, as in the present case, it is plausible that a great harm has indeed occurred.\n\nLooking forward\n\nIt remains to be seen whether other jurisdictions will recognise the value of genetic affinity. But the judgment occurs at an interesting juncture in human history. We are gaining unprecedented ability to tinker with our genetic code, and this raises interesting ethical issues.\n\nDo women with mitochondrial disorders have a right to engage in \u201cthree-parent IVF\u201d to ensure genetic affinity with a healthy child, for instance?\n\nIf we use CRISPR-cas9 gene-editing technology to alter the genes of embryos, does it constitute a loss of genetic affinity with parents? And is it possible to use such editing to shift genetic affinity, by making a child\u2019s traits more in line with one parent rather than the other?\n\nThese questions will only become more pressing as science advances, and the concept of genetic affinity may provide a coherent lens through which to consider them.\n\nG.
