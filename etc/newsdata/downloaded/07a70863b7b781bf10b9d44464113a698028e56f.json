Influencers have large followings and are invited to fashion shows where they\u2019re photographed with a terribly nice new handbag given to them by a luxury label. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s journalism.\u201d Coleridge\u2019s view is not unusual. In 2016, US Vogue\u2019s Sally Singer caused uproar for expressing a similar view, writing that \u201cbloggers who change head-to-toe, paid-to-wear outfits every hour\u201d are \u201cheralding the death of style\u201d. Needless to say, influencers view their role in the industry rather differently.\n\nColeridge is a real character. He rattles off tales about his life and circle of high society friends with theatrical charm, his voice clipped and sonorous. Ricocheting from one anecdote to the next, he frequently changes the way he sits to act out scenarios. It can sometimes be hard to get a word in edgewise, but his warmth and hospitality make up for it: I am offered tea several times and his wife, Georgia, pops in to check if I need anything else.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Peter Lindbergh's best Vogue covers Show all 10 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. Peter Lindbergh's best Vogue covers 1/10 November 1988, American Vogue Anna Wintour's first cover for American Vogue was era-defining in more ways than one. Namely because Wintour subverted a decade-long tradition of only putting elaborate occasionwear on magazine covers. Instead, she chose a beaded Christian Lacroix jacket and stone-wash Guess jeans. The smiley photograph that Lindbergh captured of Israeli model Michaela Bercu lends itself to a similarly unvarnished aesthetic, one that soon became Lindbergh's trademark. Vogue 2/10 September 1990, British Vogue This cover marks a rare moment for Lindbergh, given that its star is not a supermodel. Now an established jewellery designer, Jade Jagger is perhaps best known for being the daughter of Rolling Stones front man, Mick Jagger. She was just 19 years old at the time of this shoot and had just left boarding school in Wiltshire. Here, Lindbergh shot her unusually close-up, erasing the outline of her face to produce a truly unique image. Vogue 3/10 January 1990, British Vogue Ask any Vogue fan which is their favourite cover of all time, and most will name this one. Lindbergh famously photographed Naomi, Linda, Tatjana, Christy and Cindy at the height of their fame. What's more, he allowed their beauty to stand on its own, eschewing glittering gowns and garish makeup for jeans, stretchy tops and bare faces. Vogue 4/10 March 1990, British Vogue If anyone can put a horse on the cover of British Vogue without making it look like an equestrian catalogue, it's Lindbergh. For this special international collections issue, he photographed Danish supermodel Helena Christensen with a majestic horse whose coat matched the optic whiteness of her column dress by Giorgio di Sant'Angelo. Vogue 5/10 September 1992, British Vogue In a somewhat grungier cover than is usual for Lindbergh, Linda Evangelista poses as a tattooed, chain-laden New York City taxi driver. Vogue 6/10 October 2016, Vogue Italy In this cover, Lindbergh returned to his one of favoured aesthetics: sepia. Film met fashion in this snap - one of the three covers chosen for the issue - with Isabeli Fontana, Carolyn Murphy and Milla Jovovich captured strolling down the street in New York City's Times Square wearing androgynous ensembles by Gucci. \u201cI wanted to tell a story on the street,\" Lindbergh said of his concept. \"And while often in magazines the act of walking is portrayed in a stereotyped and frankly boring way, this is where looking to the future is for me.\" Vogue 7/10 January 2019, Vogue Japan Tilda Swinton looks almost unrecognisable in this Vogue Japan cover, sporting a black bob and an embellished blue jacket from Chanel's Haute Couture collection. With this cover, Lindbergh showed he can reinvent even one of the most famous actors with his imagery. Vogue 8/10 April 2018, Vogue Australia Emma Watson was chosen as the guest editor for this issue of the Australian fashion publication, which was focused on tackling issues related to global warming. The British actor was photographed by Lindbergh for the cover in a ruffled black gown with her hair blowing in the wind. \"Thank you, Peter Lindbergh,\" Watson wrote in her editor's letter, praising the artist's \"careful eye\". Vogue 9/10 July 2019, Vogue Germany This year's July issue of Vogue Germany was dedicated to the late Karl Lagerfeld, who died in February. The former Chanel and Fendi creative director was honoured by Lindbergh with three covers featuring Birgit Kos, Luna Bijl and Vittoria Ceretti. All three models wore looks from Chanel and Fendi. All of the images exuded a peacefulness as provided by the serene beach landscapes in the background. Vogue 10/10 September 2019, British Vogue Lindbergh photographed 15 people for the September issue of British Vogue, which was guest-edited by the Duchess of Sussex. For the issue, which was dubbed \"Forces for Change\", Meghan chose women hailing from politics, film and fashion. Each portrait was taken in a different style with different proportions, but all of them paid homage to Lindbergh's signature natural style.

You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWe\u2019re here to talk about Coleridge\u2019s new memoir, The Glossy Years, which charts his mammoth career, from Tina Brown prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to managing director at the publishers of Vogue and GQ, Cond\u00e9 Nast, where he worked for nearly 30 years (he stepped down from his managerial roles two years ago, but remains chairman of the company). In 2015, Coleridge was appointed chairman of the Victoria & Albert Museum, having previously been chairman of the British Fashion Council (BFC) and the Professional Publishers\u2019 Association (PPA). In between, he somehow managed to write 12 books, but his latest \u2013 and most personal \u2013 is the most scintillating of them all.\n\n\u201cAre you trying to f***ing poison me?\u201d Coleridge recalls Philip Green saying when being served wine at a GQ dinner\n\nColeridge\u2019s world glitters to the point of satire, something of which he is acutely aware. Childhood friends have names like Trelawny or Rupert (he went to Eton), and come from families that own islands, while today\u2019s network comprises Lords, heiresses and CEOs. But despite his well-to-do upbringing, Coleridge projects himself as an observer, noting and mocking the social nuance of the privileged inner circle within which he operates.\n\nReaders have Coleridge\u2019s astute observational skills to thank for the series of lively anecdotes that fill his memoir. There\u2019s the time he says Philip Green almost gagged from wine served to him at a GQ dinner (\u201cAre you trying to f***ing poison me?\u201d), so bought a \u00a33,000 vintage bottle of claret instead. Or a recollection that sounds as though it has been pinched from the pages of an Oscar Wilde play: the moment Coleridge says he resolved a very serious lawsuit with Harrods\u2019 PR chief Michael Cole while the pair were naked in a Mayfair steam room.\n\n\u201cI wanted to touch on the funny stuff,\u201d Coleridge explains of writing the memoir, revealing he had initially been apprehensive because \u201cit might seem a bit vain\u201d. Sure, the namedropping (Kate Moss, Rupert Everett and Elizabeth Hurley all receive mentions) verges on self-aggrandising, but then that was the world he lived in: Coleridge climbed the ranks in magazines during their Eighties heyday. The parties were opulent, the advertising budgets unlimited.\n\nPrincess Diana would sometimes pop into his office at Vogue House, and on one particularly memorable occasion, Coleridge writes, asked if he thought her breasts were \u201ctoo small\u201d. A tabloid newspaper had just published photographs of the late royal sunbathing topless on a balcony in Spain. \u201cIt was oddly striking because I didn\u2019t know her particularly well,\u201d Coleridge recalls. \u201cShe was quite mercurial. Sort of flirtatious too.\u201d Diana\u2019s attendance that day was strictly confidential. And yet a crowd of photographers were waiting for her outside because she\u2019d alerted the press herself, as Coleridge later discovered. \u201cPeople get very used to being in the public eye, so I expect she was feeling a bit insecure at that point in her life,\u201d he explains. \u201cI think she knew what she was doing.\u201d\n\nI certainly don\u2019t think London Fashion Week should be cancelled, but we need to wean ourselves off cheap synthetic clothes\n\nToday, when titles such as Marie Claire, Glamour and InStyle have all abandoned monthly print models in the UK, the magazine industry is not the sparkling force it once was. \u201cThe middle market has pretty much gone now,\u201d Coleridge says. \u201cI used to walk up and down train carriages to see what people were reading. Half had newspapers, the other half magazines.\u201d He often counted how many people were reading Marie Claire and Cosmopolitan compared to Glamour, a Cond\u00e9 Nast title that became biannual in 2017. \u201cNow I go on trains and everyone is holding their phones, scrolling through Facebook and waiting for emojis.\u201d Social media is the reason so many middle-market titles have collapsed, he explains, \u201cbecause their content was more easily replicable on other platforms\u201d.\n\nBut it\u2019s different at the upper end of the market, Coleridge says, citing Vogue, House & Garden and Tatler as titles with an \u201cexclusive eye\u201d whose authority he thinks will survive the digital apocalypse. \u201cI think most of the top glossies will outlive me.\u201d Coleridge\u2019s time at Cond\u00e9 Nast was not without controversy. In 2017, Naomi Campbell posted a photograph on Instagram of the British Vogue staff as it was under Alexandra Shulman\u2019s editorship. Every face in the photo was white. \u201cLooking forward to an inclusive and diverse staff now that @edward_enninful is the editor,\u201d Campbell wrote, rejoicing in the fact that Enninful, her close friend and former W creative director, had been appointed as Shulman\u2019s successor. \u201cI thought that was unfair of Naomi,\u201d says Coleridge. \u201cShe\u2019d appeared on the cover of the magazine so very many times during Alex\u2019s time as editor, and was written about extensively too.\u201d\n\nColeridge approves of Enninful, who has been praised for making the title feel more diverse with cover stars including Adwoa Aboah and Halima Aden, the first hijab-wearing high fashion model. \u201cI think that Edward has taken the magazine in a slightly different direction, though he\u2019s kept the standards high. I think he\u2019s very good,\u201d Coleridge says, pausing to contemplate Vogue\u2019s new direction. He continues: \u201cFor some groups the magazine has become more for them. Against that, there will be other groups for whom it might be a little less relevant.\u201d Another pause. \u201cMy overall view is that Alex had one of the most successful periods of editing Vogue and I think Edward is a very good person to be editing it now.\u201d\n\nI feel Brexit has been a terrific waste of the last three years\n\nToday, Coleridge is much less involved in Cond\u00e9 Nast than he was, having passed his extensive managerial duties onto others and traded magazines for museums. Snippets of glitz remain, like exhibition openings and the occasional foray to the front row at London Fashion Week. Though the latter could soon come to an end, given how much pressure the British Fashion Council (BFC) is under to address the industry\u2019s carbon footprint. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t think London Fashion Week should be cancelled,\u201d he booms when I ask what he makes of Extinction Rebellion\u2019s demands that the bi-annual event be replaced with a summit to address the ongoing climate crisis.\n\n\u201cI do think we need as a nation to wean ourselves off very cheap synthetic clothes that are worn once or twice and then chucked,\u201d he adds, taking the opportunity to pontificate about the Campaign for Wool, another one of his chairmanships. \u201cIt\u2019s all about trying to fight back against synthetics and plastics,\u201d Coleridge says of the organisation he runs alongside the Prince of Wales. \u201cSustainability is the strongest card that the wool campaign has at the moment. You can buy a wool jacket and still be wearing it 30 years later and it\u2019s usually still in very good nick\u201d.\n\nAnother anxiety keeping the fashion industry \u2013 along with the rest of Britain \u2013 awake at night is, of course, Brexit. The BFC has said that leaving the EU without a deal could cost the industry \u00a3900m. Coleridge voted Remain. \u201cI feel Brexit has been a terrific waste of the last three years,\u201d he sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s the only time in my life when I\u2019ve thought this is what it might\u2019ve been like to be alive in the English civil war.\u201d That said, he is optimistic the government will secure some sort of deal (\u201cTheresa May\u2019s but with knobs on\u201d) and that the British fashion industry will come out the other side. \u201cIn the short term, it\u2019s bad, but I expect we\u2019ll survive and we\u2019ll finally be able to put this completely unenjoyable episode behind us and get on with things.\u201d\n\nAs our interview draws to a close, the heavens open. Although his home is just a few minutes\u2019 walk from the tube, Coleridge insists on driving me because I don\u2019t have a jacket and I\u2019ve \u201ccome all this way\u201d. In fact, I\u2019ve only travelled three stops, but I get into his car and we continue to chat about the book. Coleridge hopes I will go out of my way to say how brilliant I think it is, and I get a sense that he is genuinely unsure whether or not it will be a success. For a second, I forget that the man beside me has spent three decades working in media, written bestselling novels and is one of the most established names in journalism, fashion and museums.\n\nI play ball and tell him how much I enjoyed the book, waving my Post-It-laden copy in his eye-line (I had pulled out the yellow stickies to identify my favourite passages, and ended up with the entire book glowing in a yellow haze). \u201cOh you are nice,\u201d he says, sounding genuinely surprised. \u201cYou see, I don\u2019t really like personal publicity,\u201d Coleridge explains, acknowledging the oddness of his remark given he\u2019s just written a memoir. \u201cI just don\u2019t love talking about myself. But if you\u2019ve spent a year and a half writing something, it\u2019s very nice when someone shows any interest at all. The whole thing makes me feel slightly anxious.\u201d\n\nThe Glossy Years: Magazines, Museums and Selective Memoirs by Nicholas Coleridge is out now", "description": "Nicholas Coleridge\u00a0is despairing over\u00a0fashion influencers.\u00a0\u201cThey can be very valuable\u00a0to brands, but I don\u2019t totally approve,\u201d the chairman of publishing house\u00a0Cond\u00e9\u00a0Nast\u00a0Britain tells me over tea in his plush Chelsea home. \u201cGreat fashion journalists have a depth of knowledge and are able to make judgements that are useful and meaningful.", "authors": ["Olivia Petter"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/26/13/nicholas-coleridge-by-felix-clay-use-this-one.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
