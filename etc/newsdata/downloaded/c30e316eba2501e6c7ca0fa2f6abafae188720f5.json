Everything is soft and luxurious, something home essentials brand Parachute excels at. The pillowcases double as a beauty treatment to help prevent fine lines and split ends.\n\nEverlane ReCashmere: The brand is recycling cashmere sweaters and blending the recycled material with extra-fine merino wool to create a brand new, super soft sweater. The ReCashmere comes in three women\u2019s styles (vintage crew, varsity cardigan, and button crop) and two men\u2019s styles (crew and v-neck). The sweaters are priced starting at $98 and go up to $120, the sweet spot for a sweater you want to invest in and get years of wear out of.\n\nAarke x CB2: When it comes to homemade sparkling water, the Aarke Carbonator is a sleek, chic way of getting bubbles into your drinks. This limited edition color and bottle are a first for the brand and will elevate any kitchen. The chrome on chrome color combination is futuristic but approachable.\n\nAllswell Bedding and Bath Collection: The Walmart-exclusive collection aims to fill the gaps in basics. It\u2019s high-quality and versatile but at a price point that makes it easy to stock up or buy a whole set. Standouts for me are the Organic Matelasse Feather Stripe Duvet Set, the Stonewashed Waffle Bathrobe, and the Organic Kantha Blanket.\n\nOne Kings Lane Open House at Bed Bath & Beyond: This massive launch includes everything you could need in your home, from accessories to furniture. The style is contemporary with a touch of glam. There\u2019s something in this vast collection for everyone and every room in your home.\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
