Many have made long and perilous journeys in their attempt to start a new life in the US.\n\nCorrespondents say all three agreements remain in a complex process of legal challenges and parliamentary ratification procedures.\n\nWhat is the latest deal?\n\nOn Wednesday, a senior US Department of Homeland Security official told US media that the deal with Honduras would \"allow migrants to seek protection as close to home as possible\".\n\nMigration experts quoted by Honduran newspaper El Heraldo said that Cubans, Venezuelans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and some Africans pass through Honduras heading to the US.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Africans risking death in the jungle trying to reach the US\n\nThe deal signed with the US could mean 26,000 migrants per year being hosted by Honduras pending their asylum applications, the newspaper estimated, with some applications taking years to process.\n\nImmigrant rights groups argue that Honduras - one of the most violent countries in the world - should never be considered a safe place for asylum seekers, many of whom will be fleeing gang violence in their own countries.\n\nThey also say that even if migrants wanted to apply for asylum in Honduras, the system there is so broken and understaffed that almost no application would receive the attention needed.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What happens if Mexico doesn't stem the migrant flow?\n\nAdding to the country's woes, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez has been named as a co-conspirator on drug-smuggling charges in a case which has already seen his brother, Tony Hern\u00e1ndez, formally charged in a US federal court. He denies any wrongdoing and says the claims are politically motivated.\n\nAddressing the UN General Assembly on Wednesday, Mr Hern\u00e1ndez hit out at what he called \"smears\" from \"criminals\" and others.\n\nWhat's the background?\n\nSimilar criticism of Wednesday's deal was made when El Salvador - which also has one of the world's highest murder rates - signed an agreement with the US on 20 September.\n\nMeghan Lopez, of the humanitarian group the International Rescue Committee, accused the Trump administration of \"attempting once more to turn its back on extremely vulnerable people\".\n\n\"El Salvador is not safe for many of its own nationals,\" she said at the time. \"It is unrealistic to expect El Salvador to be able to offer protection to asylum-seekers fleeing conditions comparable to those in El Salvador.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the US Supreme Court allowed the government to stop people arriving at the southern border from seeking protection if they failed to do so in a country they passed through en route.\n\nThe Trump administration unveiled the new asylum policy in July but it was almost immediately blocked from taking effect by a lower court ruling by a judge in San Francisco.\n\nSome 811,016 people were detained on the south-western border up until the end of August 2019, and of these, nearly 590,000 were from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The majority arrived with at least one other family member.", "description": "Critics say the country has one of the world's highest murder rates and is not a safe destination.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D0EE/production/_108968435_gettyimages-1169657587.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
