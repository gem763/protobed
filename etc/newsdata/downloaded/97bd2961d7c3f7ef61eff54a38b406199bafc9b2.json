Because if, as is being contended, there was information which suggested that the true purpose was the frustration of parliament, and that was not revealed to the Queen, then she would have the disadvantage of being given inaccurate or even improper advice.\n\n\u201cAnd since she\u2019s obliged to accept advice from the prime minister, then I think it raises into very, very sharp focus precisely the conduct of the prime minister and his very future in that role.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson\u2019s suspension of parliament has been ruled as unlawful by judges at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, prompting MPs to demand he \u201ccomes back and face the music\u201d. Rebel Tory MP Dominic Grieve said Mr Johnson would have to resign if he is found to have misled the Queen about suspending parliament.", "authors": ["Adam Forrest", "Ashley Cowburn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/10/19/boris-johnson-pimlico.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
