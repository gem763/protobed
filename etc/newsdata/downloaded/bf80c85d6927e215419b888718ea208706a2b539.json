She was really good at complimenting you but putting you down at the same time.\n\n'Then she said \"You have to brush up and be more groomed and neater\" and then she said \"Get the smoking right\" by smoking in a very particular way and remember that the cigarette holder was very much a weapon of expression as it was for smoking.'\n\nThe actress also read biographies, spoke to friends of the princess, ladies-in-waiting and relatives ahead of the role.\n\nDescribing meeting Princess Margaret as an adult, Bonham Carter said: 'I met her at Windsor at a reception and she was on her own and I approached her.\n\n'She said \"Oh Helena\", and she knew who I was because of Mark and knew who my dad was and she said \"You are getting better at acting, aren't you?\"'\n\nThe actress said Princess Margaret told her to 'get the smoking right' for her portrayal in The Crown\n\nThe actress said not only was she taking over the role from Bafta winner Vanessa Kirby but she was also trying to get under the skin of the real-life princess's complex character.\n\nShe said: 'It's daunting, definitely daunting. Vanessa has just won a Bafta and she's brilliant, and in a way you have the ghost of the real Margaret and the ghost of the actress who played her.\n\n'You also have the fact everyone has an opinion about the woman and yet ultimately very few people knew what her private life was like and that's the sort of the joy of the job.'\n\nThe 53-year-old also revealed she had met the princess as a child because her uncle, former Liberal MP Mark Bonham Carter, had gone out with her as a Grenadier Guard at Windsor, according to The Guardian.\n\nShe said: 'They really loved her, and when you go to the inner circle of people and talk to three ladies in waiting, a couple of relatives, a very close relative, and some really some close friends, they were very happy to talk about her because they miss her,' she said.\n\nThe actress said she was trying to get under the skin of the real-life princess's complex character\n\n'I felt very lucky to suddenly be the receptacle of all these stories and a lot of the time I am not going to use it, but I wanted to make sure that I wasn't going to abuse it.\n\n'I think, for a lot of the friends, they are so tired with her being portrayed in a one-dimensional, very b****y understanding of her. She herself felt very misunderstood, certainly through the press.'\n\nBonham Carter said The Crown is not a documentary but hoped those who knew the princess would like the portrayal.\n\n'I don't look like her. You just hope you get something of an idiom and a blade or a scent of them and it transforms your inner landscape,' she said.\n\n'The Crown has been very, very compassionate to most of the members of the family and has been very positive.\n\n'A lot of it is true and there is a whole floor of researchers.'\n\nBonham Carter is still best-known to many as Bellatrix Lestrange from the Harry Potter series.\n\nShe says fans often scream at her face without saying anything when they see her in the street.", "description": "The actress, 53, told the Cheltenham Literary Festival that Princess Margaret told her to 'get the smoking right' and be 'groomed and neater' in her portrayal in the Netflix series.", "authors": ["Jack Newman For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/13/19361094-0-image-a-53_1570366224281.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
