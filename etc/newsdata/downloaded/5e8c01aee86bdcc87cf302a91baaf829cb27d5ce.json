I mean the original idea when I went to [Warner Bros] with the idea was not just about one movie, but about a label \u2013 sort of a side label to DC, where you can do this kind of character study, low-rent, low-budget movies, where you get a filmmaker to come in and do some deep dive into a character.\n\n\u201cSo it was never meant to connect, so I don\u2019t see it connecting to anything in the future. I think this is just this movie, you know?\u201d\n\nPhillips, however, hasn\u2019t dismissed the possibility of doing more Joker films starring Phoenix, as long as the actor is willing.\n\n\u201cOne thing I will tell you: I would do anything with Joaquin, any day of the week,\u201d Phillips told Total Film Magazine, in an excerpt published by Comicbook.com.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nobody like him. If he was willing to do it, and if people show up to this movie, and Warners came to us and said, \u2018You know what? If you guys could think of something\u2026\u2019\n\n\u201cWell, I have a feeling that he and I could think of something pretty cool.\u201d\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5837728067001\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and attend Independent events\n\nJoker will be released on 4 October in the UK and in the US.\n\nRead more\n\nRead more Joker review: A dark, powerful film with a brooding Joaquin Phoenix\n\nJoker star Joaquin Phoenix often worried co-stars by walking off set\n\nJoaquin Phoenix says Joker was \u2018one of his greatest experiences\u2019", "description": "Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s Joker won\u2019t appear in other DC Universe movies, according to director Todd Phillips.The filmmaker clarified Joker\u2018s relation to the rest of the DC Universe during a recent Q&A; at the Toronto International Film Festival.", "authors": ["Cl\u00e9mence Michallon"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bvVxYvtYgq5FLc0mpjRREQ--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/ce80c4582aec22a06e6cec2ce9aa455c", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
