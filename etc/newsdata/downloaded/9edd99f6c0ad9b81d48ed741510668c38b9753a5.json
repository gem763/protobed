If the territory should lose that status, it \"spells disaster because that's the only industry these days that's competitive.\"\n\nProtests in Hong Kong erupted more than three months ago over a now-withdrawn extradition bill, which would have paved the way for suspects in Hong Kong to be sent to mainland China for trial. While the pro-democracy protests started out as relatively peaceful in June, they have since turned increasingly violent.\n\nHong Kong protestors on Sunday trampled on a Chinese flag, vandalized a subway station and set fire across a wide street, the Associated Press reported.", "description": "There are alternative financial centers and investors can turn to Singapore, Tokyo or Shanghai if Hong Kong doesn't \"shape up,\" says the founder and chairman of Citic Capital.", "authors": ["Saheli Roy Choudhury"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106142154-1569058586503gettyimages-1169400586.jpeg?v=1569058644", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
