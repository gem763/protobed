However, the scene that the storm left behind on Oct. 19 wasn't one that anybody wanted. Accuweather\n\nNestor, a once feared and fierce tropical storm, was helping more than hurting Sunday as it nudged north while spreading much-needed rain over a wide swath of the East.\n\nThe center of the storm was hovering over North Carolina midday on Sunday and was expected to slide offshore into the Atlantic Ocean by sometime Monday.\n\nThe storm triggered at least eight tornadoes in Florida and Georgia on Friday and Saturday, and Nestor still packed enough punch when it reached South Carolina late Saturday to damage a few homes in Myrtle Beach.\n\nOn Sunday, however, Nestor's remnants were bringing relief to rain-starved areas as far north as Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York, AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dan Pydynowski said.\n\n\"The tornadoes undoubtedly cause some damage. That was one aspect of Nestor,\" Pydynowski told USA TODAY. \"But the rain on the whole was a positive for the entire region \u2013 unless you had outdoor plans.\"\n\nA camper rests on top of a boat trailer and the corner of a home as Tropical Storm Nestor passed the area on Saturday, Oct. 19, 2019 in Kathleen, Fla.

Hurricane Lorenzo was the largest and most powerful hurricane to make it so far east in the Atlantic, bringing gusty winds to Ireland and the United Kingdom. And at one point last month, six named storms were active at once in the Atlantic and Pacific, matching a record first set in 1992.\n\nDevastating storms: The most destructive hurricanes to hit the U.S.\n\nNestor was a tropical storm when it made landfall Friday on Florida's St. Vincent Island, spinning tornadoes that flipped vehicles, damaged roofs and uprooted trees on the nature preserve off Florida's Panhandle. More than 300 miles to the southeast, school was canceled for Monday and Tuesday at Kathleen Middle School in Polk County after the storm tore a large hole in the roof.\n\n\"Our main building took damage due to strong winds during the storm early Sat morning,\" the school said in a Facebook post. \"Luckily this happened at a time where students and staff were not on campus.\"\n\nPower was being restored to thousands of homes and businesses, and tropical storm surge warnings were canceled as Nestor's wrath eased. Mexico Beach, devastated by Hurricane Michael one year ago, had braced for Nestor by providing residents with sandbags and shovels. Mayor Al Cathey said no damage was reported \u2013 adding that his city needed the rain.\n\nA surfer finds a wave in Mexico Beach, Fla. after Tropical Storm Nestor hit the town on Saturday, Oct. 19, 2019.

In some areas the drought was severe, he added.\n\nLong Island and New England are expected to get rain Sunday night and early Monday before Nestor moves off the coast and into history, Pydynowski said.\n\n\"At this point it's pretty unlikely we would get any more damaging storms from Nestor,\" he said. \"And generally speaking, this rain has been a good thing.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/20/nestor-storm-path-rain-st-vincent-island-florida-kathleen-tornado/4045103002/", "description": "Nestor, a once feared and fierce tropical storm, was helping more than hurting as it nudged north while spreading rain over a wide swath of the East.", "authors": ["John Bacon", "Published P.M.
