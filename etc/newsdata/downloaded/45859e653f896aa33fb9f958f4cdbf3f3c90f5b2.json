Invitations to the event, to which some executives traveled by private jet, were sent out to top figures in the media and advertising business this summer.\n\nPenske declined to comment, but a source familiar with the event told The Daily Beast that it was a yachting event called Red Sea Week, hosted primarily by the Robb Report, a PMC brand that caters to ultra-luxury readers and features a Saudi Arabian edition. The four-day party and conference brought together some of the largest yachts in the world, during a time when many luxury yachts are based in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nRed Sea Week is part of a major initiative by Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman called the Red Sea Project, which seeks to boost luxury tourism to Saudi-owned islands located between the Arabian Peninsula and the African continent.\n\nThe trip is the latest of business entanglements between Penske and the Saudi kingdom. Last year, PMC announced it had received $200 million in direct backing from the Saudis, later revealed to be a part of an investment from Saudi Research and Marketing Group, a Riyadh-based media and publishing company.\n\nOver the past several years, Saudi Arabia has attempted to gain a greater foothold in the American media and entertainment landscape, with mixed results.\n\nWhile there was an initial burst of interest in Saudi investments coinciding with the crown prince's visit to Hollywood last year, the murder of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist who\u2019d emerged as a major critic of the Saudi government, alienated a number of American media and entertainment companies interested in cash from the Middle Eastern powerhouse.\n\nFollowing Khashoggi\u2019s death, media outlets including CNN, The New York Times, and the Los Angeles Times quickly canceled appearances at Saudi-sponsored events. Mega talent agency Endeavor was forced to back out of a $400 million investment by the Saudi fund. Khashoggi\u2019s murder also reportedly forced Vice to review its contract with SRMG, which included agreements to create promotional documentaries about Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Red Sea Project itself has come under pressure following Khashoggi\u2019s murder. Several major names associated with the project, including Richard Branson and AOL founder Steve Case, both pulled their support from the project following the Washington Post journalist\u2019s death.\n\nAnd while Saudi investment has helped the company weather some of the adversity that has plagued the struggling U.S. media industry, Penske Media has occasionally found itself in an uncomfortable position because of its close ties to the country\u2019s wealth fund.\n\nLast year, Penske was one of the only American media companies that did not comment on or review its investments following Khashoggi\u2019s assassination, prompting criticism from peers in the business. While some employees privately raised concerns, the company has remained silent on the entire ordeal.\n\nPMC\u2019s namesake founder Jay Penske has remained one of the highest-profile figures in American media with ties to the Saudi regime. Following Khashoggi\u2019s death, Penske attended a Formula E race in Riyadh.\n\nStill, the media and entertainment backlash to Khashoggi\u2019s murder has not quelled the Saudi kingdom\u2019s desire to invest in American media. And in recent months, some interest has begun to percolate again. The Hollywood Reporter reported that independent movie studio STX was in negotiations for a potential investment from the Saudi fund earlier this summer, representing the company\u2019s first major foray into Hollywood since Khashoggi\u2019s murder.\n\n\u2014With additional reporting by Erin Banco", "description": "While most American media outlets have backed away from Saudi ties following the journalist\u2019s murder, Rolling Stone\u2019s parent company has seemingly doubled down.", "authors": ["Maxwell Tani", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571373058/191017-tani-pmc-tease_jbqdab", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
