To celebrate, Bosa mocked when Mayfield planted an Oklahoma flag in the middle of the OSU field after a 31-16 win over the Buckeyes over two years ago.\n\nBOSA JUST PLANTED HIS FLAG IN SAN FRAN \ud83d\ude24 @nbsmallerbear pic.twitter.com/wsoVZVAXiX \u2014 The Checkdown (@thecheckdown) October 8, 2019\n\nAfter the game, Bosa spoke about the gesture and what playing against Mayfield had been like.\n\n\u201cI think everybody knows what that was for,\u201d Bosa said after the game. \u201cJust wanted to get payback. He had it coming \u2026 I don\u2019t know how anybody can think he could see over Arik (Armstead) and Buck (DeForest Buckner) but he was panicking, double-clutching, rolling back and forth, we had him rattled all game.\u201d\n\nBosa\u2019s teammate Richard Sherman revealed after the game that he\u2019d tried to shake Mayfield\u2019s during the pregame coin-toss but the Browns quarterback refused.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s amazing, and annoying, was him not shaking hands at the beginning,\u201d Sherman told NFL.com. \u201cThat\u2019s some college s\u2014. It\u2019s ridiculous. We\u2019re all trying to get psyched up, but shaking hands with your opponent \u2014 that\u2019s NFL etiquette. And when you pull bush-league stuff, that\u2019s disrespectful to the game. And believe me, that\u2019s gonna get us fired up.\u201d\n\nDuring the loss for the 2-3 Browns, Mayfield completed 8-of-22 passes for a career-low 100 yards, had a 13.4 passer rating, threw two interceptions, fumbled twice and was sacked four times before being pulled in the fourth quarter.\n\nWith the win, San Francisco (4-0) joined the 5-0 New England Patriots as the only remaining undefeated teams in the NFL.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.", "description": "San Fran's 31-3 beatdow saw Cleveland quarterback Baker Mayfield play extremely poorly and get mocked by 49ers players both during the game and after it.", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1174361064-e1570540259592.jpg?fit=757%2C504", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
