I know it\u2019s light. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a definite penalty but it\u2019s not (a dive). I\u2019m not sure if Sean had maybe watched it back and all the angles when he spoke because it wasn\u2019t a dive as such.\n\n\u201cIf that becomes a dive you will start analysing every bit of contact. Was that enough to put (Burnley striker) Ashley Barnes on the floor or not? Was that enough for Callum to go down or not? That is the game, those are the grey areas. It was nowhere near a clear cut issue.\u201d\n\nReferee Michael Oliver changed his spot-kick decision following advice in his ear from the video assistant referee stationed at Stockley Park. On-field officials have so far been reluctant to use pitch-side monitors to aid their rulings, opting to rely solely on the judgements of their colleagues.\n\nLampard would like to see that change. Asked if wants referees to watch replays of contentious incidents, he replied: \u201cYes. It\u2019s part of VAR and I assumed when it came in to the Premier League that would be the case. I think we\u2019re at the point now where, from my point of view, they have to.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult. I\u2019m not one to bang the drum, it\u2019s not easy. Even with VAR there is an element of a human involved because they are the ones checking it and it\u2019s slightly opinionated. I think at the weekend we saw it flip slightly the other way from what it had been already with some decisions being changed. Hopefully we find the right middle ground as soon as possible and I think seeing a monitor on the side of the pitch is a way forward.\u201d\n\nChelsea\u2019s weekend win in the north-west secured a seventh successive victory in all competitions. The Blues will bid to extend that streak when Manchester United visit Stamford Bridge in the fourth round of the Carabao Cup. Lampard\u2019s reign began with a 4-0 thumping at Old Trafford in August, but he feels that result will have little bearing on Wednesday evening\u2019s cup tie or his team talk.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said nothing about that, it feels like a million miles away, gone,\u201d said Lampard. \u201cI\u2019m not disregarding it, when you play against a top team like Manchester United with top players they can hurt you in moments and they did it to us four times in a game we performed pretty well in. I don\u2019t think the context of that is going to be hugely relevant tomorrow night.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Chelsea\u00a0boss Frank Lampard insists there has been no need to speak to Callum Hudson-Odoi in the wake of his controversial yellow card for diving at Burnley.
