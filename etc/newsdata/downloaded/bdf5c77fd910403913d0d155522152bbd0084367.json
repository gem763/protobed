He said: \u2018If you want any evidence, any further evidence of our commitment to having a wonderful agenda not just for women but for the entire country, I can tell you that we already have the Conservative manifesto for the next Election being drawn up by two particularly brilliant women, Munira Mirza and Rachel Wolf.\n\nMr Johnson (pictured during second day of the annual Conservative Party conference) said the Tories must \u2018mobilise and support\u2019 the female vote to stay in power. His party's manifesto will be written by women with the objective of uniting the country\n\n\u2018So our manifesto is going to be written by women and our objective is to unite our country and finally to make sure that we protect the greatest country on earth, the best place to live, the best place to bring up a family, the best place to send your kids to school, that we protect it from the deprivations of a socialist government which would be an absolute disaster for the UK.\u2019\n\nAnd in a dig at his predecessor, whose 2017 Election imploded after an extremely hostile reaction by voters to her long and gloomy manifesto, Mr Johnson insisted their work is a \u2018short, concise outline with no hostages to fortune\u2019.\n\nMunira Mirza, 41, heads up the Downing Street Policy Unit and has been a close ally of Mr Johnson since his spell as Mayor of London, serving as his main policy adviser.\n\nThe daughter of Pakistani immigrants, Ms Mirza grew up in Oldham, went to a comprehensive school and then Oxford University. She was a member of the Revolutionary Communist Party in the 1990s, but later worked for right-of-centre think-tank Policy Exchange and City Hall.\n\nRachel Wolf first worked for Mr Johnson in 2006 when he was Shadow Education Minister, before she went to work for Education Secretary Michael Gove alongside current Downing Street chief aide Dominic Cummings.\n\nThe high-flying Cambridge graduate, 33, is the daughter of economics pundit Martin Wolf of the Financial Times, and a key figure in Mr Johnson\u2019s inner circle. She once revealed her job interview with him consisted of writing two essays on a choice of three topics: \u2018my trip in a spaceship, on a country ramble, or a trip to the Taj Mahal\u2019.\n\nMirza is pictured with Mr Johnson and Ekow Eshun looking at the Fourth Plynth Shortlisted Entry by Jeremy Deller, on May 18, 2008\n\nThe pair have an uphill struggle to win over female voters to Mr Johnson\u2019s cause. Women are more likely than men to find the PM \u2018dislikeable\u2019 and \u2018out of touch\u2019.\n\nAccording to a YouGov poll last month, 47 per cent of female voters found him \u2018dislikeable\u2019 \u2013 up seven points since the end of August \u2013 and five points higher than among men.\n\nAnd 51 per cent of women believed that he was \u2018incompetent\u2019, rocketing nine points in just one month.\n\nThe note (pictured above) highlights Mr Johnson's opinion of former Conservative leader David Cameron\n\nBut defending his record, Mr Johnson told the gathering of Conservative women last Sunday evening that he has used every job he has held in public life to advance their cause, saying, \u2018When I was running City Hall, it was virtually a feminocracy\u2019.\n\nAnd he added that, during his time as Foreign Secretary, \u2018we had one policy that we pursued around the world that I believe would unlock so many of the problems that beset our planet and that is to ensure that in every country on earth, every girl gets 12 years of quality education.\u2019\n\nAnd pointing to the number of women in his Cabinet, he joked that when the Women2Win group was formed in 2005, \u2018the majority view probably was that a woman in politics could expect to get a job as a secretary\u2019.\n\nHe delighted his audience by declaring: \u2018I can tell you that 14 years later that is still true. Home Secretary, Business Secretary, Trade Secretary, Work and Pensions Secretary, Environment Secretary, Culture Secretary, Housing Minister and Leader of the House of Lords.\n\n\u2018We have as many women in the Cabinet as any time in our history as far as I know.\u2019\n\nThe NHS, education and immigration \u2013 including an Australian-style points system \u2013 are expected to feature prominently in the manifesto, which will seek to avoid the mistakes of the past.\n\nLast night, a Tory source said: \u2018It\u2019s a manifesto written for women that will help women. Unlike previous attempts, this will be the most feminist manifesto ever.\u2019", "description": "The Conservative Party's manifesto is to be drawn up by two female election gurus Munira Mirza and Rachel Wolf in an attempt to 'unite our country' says Prime Minister Boris Johnson.", "authors": ["Harry Cole", "James Heale For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/22/19343080-0-image-a-13_1570310109037.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
