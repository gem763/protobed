It lost about a fifth of its population, including the vast majority of its 3 million Jewish citizens.\n\n\u201cI am here to express my feelings for the country, my patriotism, and to remind myself of these terrible times,\u201d said 68-year-old Warsaw resident Krzysztof Wojciechowski.\n\nAfter the war, the shattered capital of Warsaw had to rise again from ruins and Poland remained under Soviet domination until 1989.\n\n\u201cAs a German guest I walk before you here barefoot. I look back in gratitude to the Polish people\u2019s fight for freedom. I bow sorrowfully before the suffering of the victim,\u201d Steinmeier said at an event later in Warsaw.\n\n\u201cI ask for forgiveness for Germany\u2019s historical guilt. I profess to our lasting responsibility.\u201d\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence paid tribute to the courage of the Polish people.\n\nRelated Coverage Rise of populists in Europe resembles eve of WW2, warns London mayor\n\n\u201cNone fought with more valour, determination, and righteous fury than the Poles,\u201d Pence told the gathering of leaders in Warsaw that included German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe.\n\nPence attended the ceremony instead of U.S. President Donald Trump who cancelled his trip due to the arrival of Hurricane Dorian, a disappointment to Poland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, which is seen as one of Washington\u2019s biggest allies in Europe.\n\n\u201cAmerica and Poland will continue to call on our allies to live up to the promises we have made to one another,\u201d Pence said. He will hold bilateral talks in Warsaw on Monday.\n\nTrump and the PiS government share views on issues such as migration, energy and abortion, but the Warsaw government faces mounting isolation in Europe over accusations that it subverts democratic norms.\n\nFor some in Poland, World War Two and its commemorations are still a live political issue, just weeks before a national vote.\n\nFor the PiS, the memory of the war is a major plank of its \u201chistorical politics\u201d, aiming to counteract what it calls the West\u2019s lack of appreciation for Polish suffering and bravery under Nazi occupation.\n\nPiS politicians have repeatedly called for war reparations from Germany, one of Poland\u2019s biggest trade partners and a fellow member of the European Union and NATO, and several onlookers yelled \u201creparations\u201d after Steinmeier spoke.\n\nBerlin says all financial claims linked to World War Two have been settled, but Steinmeier continued with his theme of responsibility. \u201cBecause Germany - despite its history - was allowed to grow to new strength in Europe, we Germans must do more for Europe,\u201d he said.\n\nLeaders and officials attend a commemorative ceremony to mark the 80th anniversary of the outbreak of World War Two in Warsaw, Poland September 1, 2019.

Rather, Europe needs partners. And I\u2019m sure America needs partners in this world too ... So let\u2019s take care of this partnership!\u201d\n\nConspicuously absent was Russian President Vladimir Putin who attended Sept. 1 events in Poland 10 years ago, but wasn\u2019t invited this time, reflecting a change in relations following Moscow\u2019s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.\n\n\u201cThere could be different assessments of the Soviet policy at the early stage of the Second World War. But one cannot deny the fact that it was the Soviet Union, which defeated Nazism, liberated Europe and saved European democracy from the annihilation,\u201d Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement.\n\nELECTION LOOMING\n\nPoland was holding a series of commemorations during the day. Parallel events, attended by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and European Commission deputy chief Frans Timmermans, were held in the coastal city of Gdansk, site of one of the first battles of the war.\n\nMorawiecki spoke of the huge material, spiritual, economic and financial losses Poland suffered in the war.\n\n\u201cWe need to talk about those losses, we need to remember, we need to demand truth and demand compensation,\u201d Morawiecki said.\n\nSlideshow (30 Images)\n\nCritics say PiS\u2019s ambition is to fan nationalism among voters at a time when populists around the world are tapping into historical revisionism. PiS says the country\u2019s standing on the global stage and national security are at stake.\n\nWartime remembrance has become a campaign theme ahead of the national election due on Oct. 13, with PiS - expected to win - accusing the opposition of failing to protect Poland\u2019s image.\n\n\u201cOften, we are faced with substantial ignorance when it comes to historical policy ... or simply ill will,\u201d Jaroslaw Sellin, deputy culture minister, told Reuters.\n\nPoland commemorates the outbreak of World War Two rather than its end because it fell under Soviet domination shortly afterwards.", "description": "Germany's president asked for forgiveness for his country on Sunday for the suffering of the Polish people during World War Two as Poland marked 80 years since the Nazi German invasion that unleashed the deadliest conflict in human history.", "authors": ["Alexandra Alper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190901&t=2&i=1425063322&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF801LD"}
