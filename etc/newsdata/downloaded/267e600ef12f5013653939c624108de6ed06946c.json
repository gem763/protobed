What\u2019s not to love?\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting story that\u2019s different from much of what\u2019s on television. The issues they\u2019ve tackled on \u2018Ballers\u2019 are real.\u201d\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\nIt\u2019s long been bandied about that Johnson might one day run for president, and the actor even confirmed it himself at the recent Los Angeles Comic Con. \u201cI think the \u2018People\u2019s President\u2019 has a really nice ring to it. I\u2019ll just say that,\u201d said the action star, who previously told Vanity Fair that a presidential run \u201cwould be a great opportunity to help people.\u201d\n\nSo when asked by EW what Warren thinks about Johnson\u2019s possible run, she said, \u201cI would welcome him to the race. I know he would fight for the principles that he believes in \u2014 he\u2019s my kind of guy!\u201d Warren also added, \u201cWho doesn\u2019t like The Rock? And I have to say, who doesn\u2019t love The Rock\u2019s wardrobe choices \u2014 don\u2019t they just knock you out? Those vests and the pink shirts\u2026Oh man, it is eye candy.\u201d\n\nOverall, Warren said she\u2019s happy with HBO\u2019s decision to end \u201cBallers\u201d after five years. \u201cI have to say, five seasons feels just right for this show. I\u2019m glad they\u2019re not hanging on until they jump the shark and then you roll your eyes and stop watching because it\u2019s not any good. I think they\u2019ve done a really nice job of five seasons that have a lot of development for each of the main characters,\u201d she told EW.\n\nWarren is also a big fan of another HBO series, \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d as she revealed earlier this year.\n\nYou love to see it: @TheRock reading \u201cThis Fight Is Our Fight: The Battle to Save America\u2019s Middle Class\u201d by @ewarren. pic.twitter.com/YPh3Uwp7aC \u2014 Team Warren (@TeamWarren) August 26, 2019\n\nBest of IndieWire\n\nSign up for Indiewire's Newsletter.
