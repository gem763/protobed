He had served in various finance roles at IBM and Lenovo Group Ltd. before joining Red Hat in 2015.\n\nMr. Shander\u2019s ouster comes about three months after IBM completed its $34 billion purchase of Red Hat, a move aimed at capturing growth opportunities in the cloud space.\n\nHis departure puts Red Hat in a difficult spot, said Ivan Feinseth, director of research at Tigress Financial Partners LLC, an investment banking firm.\n\n\u201cThe fallout for companies in these situations is not only the dismissal of an executive but also the litigation risk,\u201d Mr. Feinseth said. \u201cCompanies could be held responsible for not creating and maintaining a proper workplace environment.\u201d\n\nIBM said it supports Red Hat\u2019s decision to dismiss Mr. Shander. \u201cOur values are fully aligned in this area,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\nRed Hat and Mr. Shander on May 31 agreed to a cash retention award of $4 million that would vest in two installments, six months and 12 months after the closing date of the transaction with IBM. The retention award, and others like it, were intended to keep key employees in place during the transition period, the company said in a filing.\n\nMr. Shander was dismissed without pay, the company said. To receive a retention payment installment, Mr. Shander would have had to remain continuously employed by the company or an affiliate through the vesting date, according to the agreement.\n\nLaurie Krebs, Red Hat\u2019s senior vice president for finance, has taken over as CFO, the company said. \u201cWe have confidence that Laurie will help continue and drive Red Hat\u2019s strong momentum, including that resulting from the acquisition by IBM,\u201d the Red Hat spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.\n\nIBM is scheduled to report quarterly earnings on Oct. 16, with analysts and investors expecting insights into the current state of the business.\n\n\u201cWe need to see some sort of recovery in top-line growth,\u201d said Moshe Katri, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc., pointing to successive quarters of revenue declines at IBM.\n\nThe company said in July that revenue fell for its fourth straight quarter.\n\nWrite to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com", "description": "Red Hat\u2019s finance chief Eric Shander has been dismissed from the company, forfeiting a $4 million retention award that was agreed to ahead of Red Hat\u2019s acquisition by International Business Machines.", "authors": ["Nina Trentmann", "Nina.Trentmann Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-116298/social", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
