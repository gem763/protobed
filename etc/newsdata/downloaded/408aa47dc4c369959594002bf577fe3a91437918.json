Johnny Isakson, who is resigning at the end of this year.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp will appoint a replacement for Isakson and has allowed interested candidates to apply through an online portal. Kemp\u2019s office confirmed that Price\u2019s application had been received. His application was first reported by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nPrice, a former six-term Republican congressman, was appointed by President Donald Trump to serve as HHS secretary at the outset of his administration. He resigned in September 2017 after POLITICO revealed his use of private and government planes for travel.\n\nPrice held a suburban Atlanta seat in Congress, and his resignation to join the Cabinet set off a special election that became the most expensive House race in history. Republicans narrowly held the seat in June 2017, but now-Rep. Lucy McBath flipped the seat blue in November.\n\nPrice joins several other high-profile Republicans to apply for the appointment, including Rep. Doug Collins and former Rep. Paul Broun. There\u2019s a wide range of other potential candidates for Kemp's pending appointment, and the biggest names include Rep. Tom Graves, state Attorney General Chris Carr and Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan.\n\nKemp's appointee will hold the seat until a special election, set for next November, for the remainder of the unexpired term. The seat will be up again in the 2022 elections.", "description": "Gov. Brian Kemp will appoint a replacement for Sen.
