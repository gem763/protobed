The total number of jobs in the country has increased for 108 consecutive months, driving down the unemployment rate. Nationwide, certain metro areas have benefited from these strong economic conditions more than others.\n\n24/7 Wall St. reviewed the share of residents living in households with incomes below the poverty line in 382 U.S. metro areas with one-year data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2018 American Community Survey to identify the cities with the lowest poverty rates.\n\nThe metro areas with the lowest poverty rates are spread out relatively evenly across the country. There are 42 metro areas, in 22 different states and Washington, D.C., with a poverty rate of 9.3% or less \u2013 well below the national 13.1% poverty rate. California has five metro areas on this list, more than any other state, and Wisconsin and Washington each have four.\n\nHSBC to slash 10,000 jobs globally, reports say: Labor union slams bank's response\n\nHave you outgrown your credit card?: Here are the 4 telling signs\n\nBend-Redmond, Ore.

In cases where two or more cities had the same poverty rate, median household income was used as a tiebreaker, favoring the city with a higher income. Data on the share of households receiving SNAP benefits, or food stamps, and median household income also came from the 2018 ACS. Data on annual unemployment for 2018 came from the Local Area Unemployment Statistics Program of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.
