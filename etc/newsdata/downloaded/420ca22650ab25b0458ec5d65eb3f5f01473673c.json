It was a midweek afternoon and I was at home, winding down after training, when Roy called to tell me he had important news: I was going to be his England captain.\n\nIt was an unbelievable feeling, a real \u2018punch the air\u2019 moment, and I\u2019m pretty sure Wayne Rooney will get to experience the same emotions this week when my successor is revealed. As far as I am concerned, there is no more worthy candidate to take over.\n\nRoy has tremendous faith in Wayne. When the Manchester United striker was under pressure in the summer, when there was increased speculation about his place in the England team, his manager stuck by him and played him in the games that mattered. It was a big show of respect.\n\nOn target: England forward Wayne Rooney celebrates after scoring against Uruguay at the 2014 World Cup\n\nChilling out: Rooney (left) and Steven Gerrard relax during an England training session in the Algarve in May\n\nCaptain: Rooney (right) leads out Manchester United for the pre-season friendly against Valencia on August 12\n\nRed devil: Rooney celebrates scoring for Manchester United against Swansea in their Premier League opener\n\nPerhaps other managers would have taken him out of the firing line and put him on the bench when the scrutiny increased, but Roy knows what Wayne brings to England\u2019s team and, just as crucially, what he will continue to contribute in the next few years.\n\nSo why do I think Wayne is the No 1 choice? For starters, he is a natural leader. Aside from being a top player, one who commands respect within the group, Wayne is passionate about representing his country and won\u2019t be fazed by the responsibility.\n\nBefore a game, he is one of the most vocal players in the dressing room. He wouldn\u2019t be afraid of speaking up and talking to someone one-to-one, telling them what is expected.\n\nWhen he was my deputy, he gave me great support and during our 11 years with England I saw him blossom. There were times when, as a young lad, he didn\u2019t always say the right things in the dressing room but he has matured and chooses his words carefully.\n\nTeammates: Gerrard (left) is congratulated by Rooney after scoring against Poland at Wembley last year\n\nCalled it a day: Gerrard retired from international football in July after winning 114 caps for England\n\nHe\u2019s brave, too. Wayne won\u2019t go missing in a game nor will he duck any issues with the media; whether he is in world-class form or going through a difficult patch, he doesn\u2019t shy away from questions.\n\nDon\u2019t think, though, he will expose players in public if things aren\u2019t going well. That wasn\u2019t my style, nor will it be his. He knows the best place to deliver such words is in closed quarters and those he will have to speak to will appreciate him doing it the right way.\n\nI also believe it is important for an England captain to lead his club. Everything that compelled Louis van Gaal to make Wayne United captain after working with him for six weeks are the qualities that Roy has seen at every get-together for the past two years.\n\nMy England journey with Wayne started in March 2003. I\u2019d known of him since he was playing for Everton\u2019s Under-13 side with my cousin, Anthony. I was well aware of the hype surrounding him when he broke into Everton\u2019s first team.\n\nYounger days: Gerrard (right) congratulates Rooney on scoring for England against Liechtenstein in 2003\n\nThe heat is turned up, however, when you get selected for England and I remember thinking, when we joined up for that European Championship qualifier away to Liechtenstein, \u2018let\u2019s have a proper look at what you\u2019ve got\u2019 before training with him for the first time. I missed his debut against Australia the previous month as I was injured.\n\nIt quickly became apparent this was his stage. During a training game he conjured a chip from nothing that sailed over David James; it was an audacious thing to attempt but Wayne \u2014 then only 17 \u2014 carried on as if it was the most natural thing to do.\n\nAS the ball nestled in the net, the session stopped so everyone could applaud. It wasn\u2019t a bad way to settle yourself into the group.\n\nTaking the armband won\u2019t be new for Wayne \u2014 he\u2019s led England before, against Brazil in Qatar in 2009 and San Marino in October 2012 \u2014 but it is a different feeling from when you are just borrowing it.\n\nWearing the armband: Rooney (right) is put under pressure by San Marino's Christian Brolli in October 2012\n\nUnited: Rooney (3rd left) captained England for the international friendly against Brazil in Doha in 2009\n\nI couldn\u2019t wait to walk into the dressing room after Roy gave me the news, and it will be the same for Wayne. He will be desperate to get to Wembley for the Norway friendly and the added responsibility could be the catalyst to go on and break Sir Bobby Charlton\u2019s record of 49 goals.\n\nEverything is there for him now. He is set to be captain and the next two tournaments, in France and Russia, are the most important he\u2019ll play in \u2014 they can define his legacy.\n\nWe played together 71 times for England and at his best, he is a world-class talent. After the disappointment of Brazil, this is a fresh start for everyone and Wayne can lead the team positively into the new campaign.\n\nTearful goodbye: Gerrard (centre) was emotional after his last match for England at the World Cup in Brazil\n\nIf and when he leads the team out on September 3, I\u2019ll be delighted for him. We are two lads from council estates in Liverpool who have loved playing for England, and I know what emotions Wayne will feel when he stands at the head of the line in the tunnel.", "description": "Wayne Rooney is a natural leader.
