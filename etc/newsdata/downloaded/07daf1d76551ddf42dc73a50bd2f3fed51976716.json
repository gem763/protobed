Fitch has also affirmed its US dollar unsecured bond rating of 'BB+'.YHID invests in and constructs public works, such as land and urban development, industrial parks and social housing, in the Yichang High-Tech Development Zone in Hubei province. The entity was the second-largest infrastructure-investment platform in Yichang municipality by asset size in 2018. Key Rating Drivers 'Very Strong' Status, Ownership and Control: YHID was established under China's company law. The legal status indicates that the local government is not responsible for the entity's liabilities in the case of a default. However, we believe the municipality has a strong incentive to provide extraordinary support due to its sole ownership of the entity, and the highly interrelated projects between the two. YHID's overall operations and financing decisions are subject to the local government's review and approval.'Strong' Support Record and Expectations: The local government has provided continuous subsidies of CNY200-300 million each year, easing the company's financial burden. Favourable tax treatment (effective tax rate of 10% in 2018) and continuous awarding of new orders helped to stabilise its operations. Government contributions for projects also provided financial stability for social-overhead capital (SOC) investments. We expect constant support to be forthcoming as it is critical to make SOC projects viable.'Moderate' Socio-Political Implications of Default: YHID undertook 95% of the government's investment projects in the development zone in 2018 and continues to play an important role in 2019 (estimated 88% of the total project investment), indicating a default by YHID could hamper the zone's development. However, the entity's business remains contained within the zone and we believe a substitute in the municipality can potentially carry out similar functions, financing and investment with only a temporary disruption.'Strong' Financial Implications of Default: We believe a default of the entity could significantly hinder the local government's borrowing capacity as a substantial amount of the entity's debt is associated with SOC projects, making YHID the second-largest financing platform in the municipality by debt size. The entity finances its investments through various financial institutions including policy and local banks. A default by the entity would hamper the borrowing ability of other groups in the municipality, leading to increases in the costs of financing. 'b' Standalone Credit Profile: Revenue from construction of SOC projects accounts for 97% of the total, which we expect to remain high in light of the projects in the pipeline. This implies weaker revenue defensibility and operating risk as policy-driven demand and operations can be volatile upon policy changes. Continuous investments caused debt to expand by 42% yoy in 2018, indicating high leverage, measured by Fitch-adjusted net debt/EBITDA, of 28x, while its net debt to equity remained below 1.0x. This suggests a 'Weaker' financial-profile assessment, which mainly limits its Standalone Credit Profile. Derivation Summary YHID's ratings reflect the four factors under our Government-Related Entities Rating Criteria that give a weighted score of 30, which is combined with the 'b' Standalone Credit Profile under Fitch's Rating Criteria for Public-Sector, Revenue-Supported Debt. RATING SENSITIVITIES A revision in Fitch's perception of the sponsor's ability to provide subsidies, grants or other legitimate resources allowed under China's policies and regulations would lead to a change in ratings. Positive rating action may be triggered by a revised assessment of the socio-political implications of a default, enhancing the sponsor's incentive to provide legitimate support.A downgrade may result from a significant weakening of the assessment of the socio-political and/or financial implications of a default, or the assessment of our expectations of support, or a dilution of the government's ownership.Any rating action on YHID's Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating would result in a similar rating action on its US dollar senior unsecured bond.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.

A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.
