In the scene, a group of stormtroopers are chasing the film's heroes through the Death Star. As a door lifts open, one stormtrooper's helmet collides with the opening door, momentarily setting them aback.\n\nAccording to Stangroom, producer Gary Kurtz used the clip because it was the best take they had. Though it flew under the radar for years, a sound effect was added to the scene, highlighting the mishap in a 2004 DVD re-release.\n\nStangroom, left, speaks with actors Martyn Reid, center, and Laurie Goode, right.

(Jamie Stangroom/YouTube)\n\nOver three years, Stangroom investigated three actors \u2014 suspects, as he calls them \u2014 each claiming that they were the man underneath the clumsy stormtrooper's helmet.\n\nThe most famous of the bunch, late British soap star Michael Leader, declined to be part of the project. Two others, Laurie Goode and Martyn Reid, underwent a polygraph test to determine whether they truly believed they were the mystery actor.\n\nBoth actors are vehement it was them behind the mask. Goode even attends Star Wars fan conventions, offering autographs, as \"the clumsy stormtrooper.\"\n\nDespite that, the test came out in favour of Reid. Stangroom says telling Goode he failed was a \"horrible moment.\"\n\n\"I genuinely believe that he believes he was that stormtrooper even though maybe he wasn't. So telling him that he's, perhaps, been living a lie for all of these years was horrible,\" Stangroom said.\n\nStangroom concedes, however, that not even director George Lucas could provide confirmation.\n\nBut in The Empire Strikes Door, Stangroom comes as close as he can to settling the matter by convening a panel of pop-culture experts, including filmmaker Kevin Smith and wrestler Chris Jericho.\n\nThe panel agreed: All evidence points to Reid.\n\nWhile Stangroom agrees with the jury's conclusion, he still has doubts given his own experience wearing the stormtrooper suit.\n\n\"They really are, especially when you're moving, quite hard to see through,\" Stangroom said.\n\n\"So I'm convinced that they all bumped their head. And I'm convinced that they're all convinced that they did it in that scene.\"", "description": "In his new film, The Empire Strikes Door, Jamie Stangroom interviews different Star Wars actors who claim to be the stormtrooper who smacked his noggin in the Death Star.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5309685.1570218373!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/star-wars-head-bonk.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
