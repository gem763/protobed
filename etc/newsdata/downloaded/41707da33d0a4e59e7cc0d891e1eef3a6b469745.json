Customers should prepare for prolonged power outages, he said.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Everyone needs to stay in a safe place and off the roads until the storm passes,\" North Carolina governor Roy Cooper said.\n\nAbout 150 evacuees were camped out at Charlotte Motor Speedway in North Carolina, speedway spokesman Scott Cooper said.\n\nLeslie Lanier was one of those who decided to stay behind on Ocracoke Island. She boarded up her home and bookstore, making sure to move the volumes higher.\n\n\"I think we're in for a great big mess,\" she said.\n\nThe National Hurricane Centre forecast as much as 38cm of rain for the coastal Carolinas, with flash-flooding likely.\n\nOn Thursday, Dorian swamped roads in historic downtown of Charleston, South Carolina, and knocked down some 150 trees and toppled power lines. Gusts had topped 80mph in some areas.\n\nDorian apparently spawned at least one tornado in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, damaging several homes, and another twister touched down in the beach town of Emerald Isle, North Carolina, mangling and overturning several trailer homes in a jumble of sheet metal. No immediate injuries were reported.\n\nThe four deaths attributed to the storm in the mainland US took place in Florida and North Carolina. All of them involved men who died in falls or by electrocution while trimming trees, putting up storm shutters or otherwise getting ready for the hurricane.\n\nAssociated Press", "description": "Residents of North Carolina are preparing for a possible direct hit by Hurricane Dorian, after the storm triggered tornadoes in South Carolina.
