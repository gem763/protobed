REUTERS/Monika Deupala\n\nXi will be the first Chinese president to visit Nepal in 22 years and will arrive from India, where he held talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Landlocked Nepal, a natural buffer between India and China, has been trying to lessen its dependence on New Delhi.\n\nThe Chinese leader will meet Oli on Sunday and the two leaders are expected to sign a slew of deals, including the planned extension of the rail link from remote, mountainous Tibet to Nepal\u2019s capital, Kathmandu, officials said.\n\nThe link will be part of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, Xi\u2019s signature project that Nepal joined in 2017.\n\nRajan Bhattarai, one of Oli\u2019s top aides, said a feasibility study of the plan had been conducted by Chinese experts.\n\n\u201cAn agreement for the preparation of a detailed project report for the railway link is expected to be signed after the prime minister\u2019s meeting with President Xi on Sunday,\u201d Bhattarai told Reuters.\n\nThe report will contain cost estimates, with financing and construction models to be decided, officials said.\n\nNepal sees the rail link with China as an alternative to its dependence on India. New Delhi accounts for nearly two-thirds of Nepal\u2019s trade and is the sole source of its fuel supply.\n\nA prolonged blockade of its border crossings with India in 2015 and 2016 left Nepal short of fuel and medicine for months.\n\nAsian giants India and China have both sought to woo Nepal and have poured in aid and infrastructure investment.\n\nBeijing has helped build or upgrade highways, airports and power plants in Nepal under the Belt and Road infrastructure drive - a string of ports, railways, roads, bridges and other investments tying China to Europe via central and southern Asia.", "description": "Chinese President Xi Jinping is due to arrive in Nepal on Saturday for talks with Prime Minister K.P.
