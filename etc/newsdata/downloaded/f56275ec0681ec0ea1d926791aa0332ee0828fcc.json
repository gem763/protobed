REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo\n\nState-controlled EDF said in a statement it had identified problems with 16 generators installed in six operating reactors in plants in France. It also discovered issues with components not yet in service, notably at the nuclear plant it is building in Flamanville, northern France.\n\nEDF, whose shares rose nearly 4% in early trade, said that at the current stage of investigations the issues that had been identified do not adversely affect the components\u2019 fitness for service and do not require immediate action.\n\nA spokeswoman for French nuclear regulator ASN said it had no comment on EDF\u2019s statement and said it was still investigating the weldings problem. She did not say when ASN might rule on the matter.\n\n\u201cThere is still the risk that the French nuclear safety authority will decide that unplanned outages will be required for repairs, but today\u2019s announcement implies that this would only be the case for just over 10% of EDF\u2019s operating reactors,\u201d Barclays said in a note.\n\nRegis Clement, deputy head of EDF\u2019s nuclear fleet, told reporters on a call that not a single component in EDF\u2019s nuclear reactors was at risk due to the welding problems.\n\n\u201cThe availability of our reactors in the weeks and months ahead is not at risk. We are confident for the winter ahead,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that EDF was investigating the issue, but not planning repairs. He declined to comment on any further impact on the already long-delayed Flamanville construction schedule.\n\nFrance is a major power exporter and EDF\u2019s stable nuclear output plays a key role in balancing electricity flows in Europe, providing backup for intermittent solar and wind power.\n\nIn the autumn of 2016, the regulator, ASN, ordered EDF to close up to a third of its reactors for weeks for safety checks and repairs following problems with Framatome-made components, which caused power prices to spike 60 percent in two months.\n\nFRAMATOME INSPECTION\n\nOn Wednesday, the ASN spokeswoman also said the regulator had asked EDF for additional information and was set to carry out an inspection at the Saint-Marcel plant in western France of EDF\u2019s reactor manufacturing unit Framatome.\n\nA London-based trader said the market remained cautious while it waited for a final ASN decision.\n\nThe problems were identified in reactors no. 3 and 4 at Blayais, reactor no. 3 at Bugey, reactor no. 2 at Fessenheim, reactor no. 4 at Dampierre-en-Burly and reactor no. 2 at Paluel, EDF said.\n\nThe defects in components not yet in service were found in the four steam generators and the pressurizer at the Flamanville 3 EPR, as well as three new steam generators destined for those in reactor units no. 5 and 6 at Gravelines, it added.\n\nEDF\u2019s share price have recovered most of the losses incurred since EDF first announced the weldings problems on Sept. 10, when its shares dropped about 7 percent.\n\nFrench forward power prices were broadly lower in early trade as worries about potential reactor closures eased. The front-month contract lost 5% to 47 euros a megawatt hour (MWh). The year-ahead baseload contract was down 1.8% at 52.50 euros/MWh.\n\nBritish and Dutch gas prices for October delivery fell around 5% after EDF\u2019s comments. Prices jumped last week when the problems first emerged as demand for gas, which can be used in power generation, rose on concern about nuclear shutdowns.\n\nThe British month-ahead gas price < TRGBNBPMc1>, which spiked 20% last week, fell 5.7% to 33.15 pence per therm. The Dutch month-ahead gas price < TRNLTTFMc1>, which jumped 18% last week, fell 5.5% to 12.95 euros per megawatt hour.", "description": "French utility EDF said on Wednesday there was no need to halt any of its nuclear reactors for now following the discovery of problems with weldings in their steam generators last week.", "authors": ["Geert De Clercq", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431166396&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0ME", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
