Fiji are going to be tough for us. They had a great performance against Georgia.\n\nWales have won their opening two matches in Japan, including a stunning win over Australia\n\n'They're very much a confidence side so we'll have to be on top of our game and be defensively strong at the set-piece.\n\n'We've got a short turnaround of four days so a lot of the players who haven't had any rugby will get an opportunity then. They'll be chomping at the bit to play against Uruguay.'\n\nMeanwhile Wales are 'blessed' with their fly-half double-act of Dan Biggar and Rhys Patchell \u2013 according to former No 10 Stephen Jones.\n\nThe 41-year-old won 104 caps for Wales at fly-half, so knows more than most the pressures of the iconic red shirt.\n\nBut since coming into Wales' World Cup camp \u2013 as a replacement for attack coach Rob Howley, who was sent home amid allegations of betting offences \u2013 he has been mightily impressed with Biggar and Patchell.\n\n'They're brilliant, absolutely brilliant,' Jones said.\n\nWales have thrived so far in Japan with Dan Biggar (left) and Rhys Patchell (right) at fly-half\n\n'You look at the talent they both have, the mental toughness they have, it's great. We are in a fortunate position.\n\n'Dan's been an absolute credit. These guys are open minded, they are evolving and improving all the time. That's the mindset you've got to have. Looking at their work ethic, determination and will to improve it's a pleasure to work with them.\n\n'I just think we're blessed. From my end \u2013 to go out on the paddock and work with those guys, when you've got a group driving each other all the time, that's what you want.'", "description": "WILL KELLEHER IN OTSU: Warren Gatland sent out a rallying cry to Wales ahead of their upcoming match against Fiji - win the World Cup pool and we will be mentally stronger.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/06/19325000-0-image-a-20_1570255072740.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
