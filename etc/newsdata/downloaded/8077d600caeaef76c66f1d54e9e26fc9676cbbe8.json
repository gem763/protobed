Business Insider Intelligence\n\nMost of Netflix's growth is likely to continue to come from international markets. That trend was once again evident this quarter: International sub adds \u2014 6.3 million, up 23% YoY \u2014 contributed the vast majority (93%) of total additions in the quarter, up from about 84% share of total adds from international in the prior-year quarter. And in Q2 2019, international subs made up 100% of total net adds, as Netflix lost US subs for the first time ever in the quarter.\n\nBut Netflix will face competition on two main fronts \u2014 price and content \u2014 that we expect to make it harder to continue growing US subscribers in particular. Netflix is likely to retain the majority of subs as it continues to invest in original content, but price sensitivity combined with growing competition from lower-priced, buzzy SVOD offerings will likely contribute to elevated domestic churn in coming quarters.\n\nAmong Netflix subscribers, 27% said they were interested in Disney+, 13% in HBO Max, and 11% in Peacock \u2014 and about 12% of those who said they were interested in one of those SVODs said they were excited by being able to cancel other streaming services, per a HarrisX poll.\n\nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings attributed weakness on domestic adds to price hikes that went into effect in Q2 \u2014 but it's unlikely that price hike will be Netflix's last. Hastings noted that the service is \"incredibly low-priced compared to cable ... we think we have a lot of room there\" \u2014 suggesting that the company expects to have continued flexibility to increase price.\n\nHastings also said that Netflix wouldn't adjust its own pricing based on forthcoming services that are expected to undercut Netflix, including Disney+ ($7 a month, as a standalone) and Apple TV+ ($5 a month). We expect that some consumers will run those comparisons as they examine their household entertainment spend in coming quarters. Netflix could introduce cheaper mobile-only plans in the US \u2014 as it's done in India \u2014 but it's unclear whether device-limited plans would be desirable in every market: While 35% of global sub sign-ups happen via mobile, 70% of viewing happens on connected TVs, per Netflix data.\n\nAs new entrants emerge, Netflix will be under heightened pressure to bring content to the service that will not only attract subs, but retain them by becoming must-have. To that end, Netflix is reinvesting billions in content that can generate cultural buzz (attract) and broad, deep engagement (retain) among current subs: For example, season 3 of \"Stranger Things\" released in the quarter was watched by 64 million member households in its first four weeks on the service \u2014 about 40% of Netflix's total global sub base.\n\nMovies starring A-list talent are also likely to continue to be a key area of investment, given their ability to create buzz and feel high-value for consumers who might have otherwise spent $8.93 on a movie ticket.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
