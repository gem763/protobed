But the sales side of the business is often secondary to the recruitment of new participants. Those on the top of the pyramid can make substantial money but it\u2019s mostly on the backs of people at the bottom who are recruited to entice others into the business.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAdvoCare charged people $59 to become a distributor, the FTC said in its complaint. In turn, distributors were encouraged to recruit people to be part of their \u201cdownline.\u201d Top distributors would then earn commissions ranging from 5 percent to 20 percent of purchases by members of their downline.\n\nIn its complaint, the FTC said people were told that they had the potential to earn unlimited income and \u201cattain financial freedom, and eliminate the constraint of traditional employment.\u201d\n\nBut in reality, the overwhelming majority of distributors never earn any money from their activities, the FTC said. The business model was really to \u201crecruit business builders who recruit business builders who recruit business builders,\u201d the complaint said.\n\nAD\n\nAnd, to achieve a high-enough level in the company, each year recruits had to keep buying thousands of dollars worth of product themselves.\n\nAD\n\nThe claims of potential earnings were preposterous, the FTC said. One recruitment video said distributors could earn as much as $50,000 a month. Another pointed to a distributor who made more than $413,000 a year.\n\nThe FTC said recruiters were told that \u201cthey did not need to believe their income projections \u2014 they just needed recruits to.\u201d\n\nSo, how much were people really making?\n\nNot much at all, the FTC alleged. The agency says in 2016, 72.3 percent of distributors did not earn any income from AdvoCare; 18 percent earned between one cent and $250; and 6 percent earned between $250 and $1,000.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLegitimate businesses make money selling products and services, not by recruiting,\u201d said Andrew Smith, director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection. \u201cThe drive to recruit, especially when coupled with deceptive and inflated income claims, is the hallmark of an illegal pyramid.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn a statement, AdvoCare took issue with the FTC\u2019s characterization of its multilevel marketing business model as an illegal pyramid scheme.\n\n\u201cWe strongly disagree with the FTC allegations, but we are committed to abiding by this agreement and moving forward,\u201d AdvoCare chief executive Patrick Wright said.\n\nAD\n\nYet, as part of the settlement, the company is banned from the multilevel marketing business. Distributors can no longer earn compensation based on purchases by people in their downline. If distributors had significant losses they may be entitled to get some of their money back, according to the settlement.\n\nThis case is further proof of why I\u2019m not a fan of multilevel marketing, also referred to as network marketing. Although the business model involves selling a product, to be an elite team member you have to constantly recruit people into the business. This can result in every family member, friend or acquaintance being viewed as a potential convert.\n\nAD\n\nRead this guide from the FTC: Multi-Level Marketing Businesses and Pyramid Schemes\n\nAD\n\nLaura Richards, a freelance journalist, received quite a bit of feedback when she wrote that the drive to find recruits has led to \u201cunderhanded tactics that strain, fracture and sometimes end friendships and family relationships.\u201d\n\nRichards wrote, \u201cOver the past few years, many women\u2019s social media feeds have morphed from photos of kids and pets into endless posts by friends peddling everything under the sun: makeup, skin care, candles, essential oils, hormone gel patches, leggings, tote bags, juice powders, nontoxic cleaning products, whitening toothpaste, vitamins, nail decals, nutritional shakes and gardening towers.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMost people who join legitimate MLMs make little or no money,\u201d the FTC warns in the guide. \u201cSome of them lose money. People who become involved in an illegal pyramid scheme may not realize they\u2019ve joined a fraudulent venture, and typically lose everything they invest. Some also end up deeply in debt.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIf you\u2019re still thinking about getting into multilevel marketing, even as a side hustle, watch Showtime\u2019s \u201cOn Becoming a God in Central Florida,\u201d which stars Kirsten Dunst as Krystal Stubbs. You only need to watch the first episode to see how these schemes sell the promise of financial freedom to people who can least afford the pitch.\n\nDunst plays the suffering wife whose husband, Travis, quits his job to work full time pushing FAM (Founders American Merchandise), a multilevel marketing scheme.\n\nAD\n\nAs Hank Stuever, The Washington Post\u2019s TV critic, writes in his review of the show, which premiered in late summer, \u201cTravis is utterly suckered into the strategy of selling FAM-branded household goods while recruiting gullible others (known as \u2018downliners\u2019) to join the sales force, motivating them to order more stock and recruit still more salespeople, while brainwashing them with costly, FAM-generated cassette tapes that contain lectures of self-determined gobbledygook.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nColor of Money Question of the Week\n\nWhat\u2019s been your experience with a multilevel marketing business?

Lots of folks have plenty to say \u2014 often with profanity-laced commentary \u2014 about the practice of tipping in America.\n\nIn case you missed the series of columns, read:\n\nAD\n\nPeople continue to weigh in on the topic.\n\nDeeAnn Brewer wrote: \u201cYour column on tipping really made me think about those times we only tip 15% for egregious service. Please don\u2019t be dismayed by people\u2019s reactions. You probably made some people feel guilty. Rather than reckon with their behavior, it was easier to disparage you. Don\u2019t take it to heart.\u201d\n\nJan Tremain from Holly Hill, Fla., wrote: \u201cHere\u2019s what pushes my feathers backward: Friends who have gabbed along with me for an hour or so in a busy restaurant and then dare to leave a lousy dollar! That is selfish and thoughtless. I then make it a point to overtip and state clearly that it\u2019s because the waitress (or waiter) could have gotten another tip (or perhaps, two) had we not been sitting there flapping our jaws way after our meal was finished.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHank Cusanek of Phoenix wrote: \u201cWhen I get poor attitude and mediocre service, I leave a mediocre tip. Good attitude and good service gets a better tip. I couldn\u2019t bring my personal problems to work with me and I don\u2019t expect restaurant wait staff to bring theirs to work either. Low-end restaurants have low cost menu prices and high-end restaurants have high cost menu prices. Waiters/waitresses decide where they want to work for various reasons. For whatever reason, they chose their place of employment. If they want more tip money, they should excel at their job and move up the scale to better and better restaurants. Tips are incentive to do a good job just like promotions are in the corporate world.\u201d\n\nJan Marshall of McKinney, Tex., wrote: \u201cI\u2019m appalled that there are some who think that tips should be given regardless of the level of service. Tips are not an entitlement and no one should be bullied into leaving a predetermined tip percentage after poor service.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry but I couldn\u2019t disagree with you more,\u201d wrote Ken Sims of Sarasota, Fla. \u201cI believe tipping makes me a payroll/boss to a certain extent. The one thing I\u2019m not allowed to do is fire them for doing a poor job but it does give me the right to not reward poor work habits. I\u2019m also not pleased with the position restaurant owners have put their customers in by making them feel they have to support their staff through tips.\u201d\n\nLots of readers object to basing a tip on the food total.\n\n\u201cI hate the way we tip in America,\u201d one reader wrote. \u201cCharge accordingly to cover your employees wages. The wait staff works just as hard on a $15 breakfast as a $40 steak dinner. Tipping them a percentage is outdated and the wrong method for rewarding service.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne thing I wish you had discussed that I think needs to be considered by our culture around tipping is extreme income inequality,\u201d Wes Gray wrote. \u201cWhy does a waiter at the Capital Grille, with a tab of $110, get over $20 for a tip and the waiter at my local Chili\u2019s, with a tab of $15, get only $3? After thinking about this, I now pay all waiters the same amount regardless of where they work, because they all do the same amount of work. What do you think, and would you consider discussing this in one of your future columns?\u201d\n\nI might consider addressing the issue. But I fear for my sanity, for every column and newsletter about tipping unleashed some of the meanest comments I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nWalt Gamache of St. Peters, Mo., is not happy with tip inflation, writing, \u201cI will not dine anymore when expected tip percentages exceed 20 percent.\u201d\n\nI asked folks what things about socializing out bother them.\n\nKatherine France wrote: \u201cMy pet peeve is asking people who don\u2019t drink to cover expensive bar tabs when splitting the bill. It\u2019s happened a few times with my friends and I usually ask politely for the drinkers to kick in more. That can result in problems with attitudes and then there is the math, which is not easy for a lot of people. Oh, and how to split the tax and tip fairly. Arghhhh \u2026 We\u2019re back to tipping again!\u201d\n\nKen Thetford of Bethany Beach, Del., was surprised to learn about the minimum wage for waitstaff. \u201cDuring discussion of the tipping issue I learned that the government is largely responsible for the confusion,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFor example, I did not know that there was a separate \u2018minimum wage\u2019 for those individuals deemed to work in a \u2018tipping position.\u2019 So the government has pushed the need for customers to subsidize wages for these workers.\u201d\n\nColor of Money columns this week\n\nKnowledge isn\u2019t power.\n\nThe right knowledge is power.
