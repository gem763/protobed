Politicians and pundits hurl charges of treason. The two parties are at each other\u2019s throats. Many of us know friends or family members who\u2019ve stopped speaking because of events in Washington, D.C.\n\nSome Americans seem ready to believe the worst of their country and fellow Americans. Respect for bedrock institutions like the press, government, and Wall Street has eroded away. Many young people say they value patriotism less than previous generations.\n\nWhat to do? There is no quick, short-term fix, but here\u2019s a good one for the long term: American history.\n\nNot social studies, or politics dressed up as history, or attempts to run the country down, but history that actually lifts us. History\u2014especially American history\u2014can encourage us toward virtues and truths badly needed in our time.\n\nFirst and perhaps most important, it can encourage hope. In the midst of terrible civil war, Abraham Lincoln called this nation \u201cthe last best hope of earth.\u201d For nearly a century before Lincoln, and easily for a century afterward, Americans would not have doubted that assertion.\n\nOur history is full of resounding stories of hope in times of struggle. Think of those Jamestown and Plymouth settlers, standing on the edge of a New World, equipped with little more than hope for freedom and better lives. Or the Rev. Martin Luther King at the Lincoln Memorial, speaking of his dream of a day when all people will be judged not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\n\nHistory can encourage gratitude for our remarkable country and for those who made it possible for us to lead free and happy lives. Time and again, our ancestors have chosen wisely, and, by their demeanors, defined us as a people, sometimes with great sacrifice.\n\nThink of those Americans at Philadelphia in 1787 who devised the most miraculous political document in history just as the young nation seemed to be falling apart. Or Americans standing fast against totalitarianism during the Cold War. Knowing those stories helps make us thankful to be Americans.\n\nHistory, properly told and learned, encourages truth. It does not cover up wrongs. It tells the story of both justices and injustices. And it is true that, at times, the United States has fallen tragically short of its ideals.\n\nBut we must remember that America is still a great success story. When we criticize\u2014and criticize we must\u2014we should play the part of what James Madison called a \u201cloving critic.\u201d The late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan put it this way: \u201cAm I embarrassed to speak for a less than perfect democracy? Not one bit. Find me a better one.\u201d\n\nHistory encourages patriotism. It reminds us that our founding principles of liberty and equality are among humanity\u2019s noblest aspirations. That the United States was the first nation in history created out of the belief that people should govern themselves. That no other country has done a better job of establishing equal rights for all citizens.\n\nEvery American, regardless of background, has a claim on our great history. We have all inherited the principles laid down in the Declaration of Independence. Lincoln called that claim an \u201celectric cord\u201d that \u201clinks the hearts of patriotic and liberty-loving men together, that will link those patriotic hearts as long as the love of freedom exists in the minds of men throughout the world.\u201d\n\nYes, I know it sounds old-fashioned, but American history can encourage students, politicians, journalists, and all of us toward these virtues and truths that link us together. If told honestly and well, it can unite us in divided times.\n\nDr. William J. Bennett, former United States Secretary of Education (1985\u20131988), is one of America\u2019s most influential and respected voices on cultural, political, and educational issues.
