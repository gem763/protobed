Independents remain opposed on balance, albeit less opposed than they were a week ago.\n\nIs 47/47 enough to make Senate Republicans sweat? Nah. But one clear result from this new survey from Quinnipiac and other surveys over the past week is that the public is, shall we say, \u201cimpeachment-curious.\u201d They\u2019re not ready to take the plunge on ousting Trump, but there\u2019s consistently support for opening an impeachment *inquiry* into the Ukraine matter. Independents are willing to let Democrats sniff around here. But for the moment, at least, they\u2019re not ready to do more than that.\n\nThere\u2019s something for everyone there. For Republicans, there\u2019s comfort in knowing that indies are on your side. For Democrats, there\u2019s the fact that a clear majority of people who are paying \u201ca lot\u201d of attention to the Ukraine story support impeachment. (Although that result may confuse cause and effect. How many people paying close attention to this are doing so because they\u2019ve hated Trump all along and want to see him gone?) A weird anomaly in the data is the fact that a plurality of people aged 65+ support impeachment, 49/46. Normally seniors skew Republican. I wonder if they\u2019re more sensitive to alleged presidential abuses of power because they lived through Watergate. Or if they simply have a more solid educational foundation in civics than slightly younger adults.\n\nOther results in this same poll will encourage Democrats. A majority of people think Trump has abused his power in office (54 percent, including 53 percent of independents), and by a margin of 50/40 Americans think Trump did something wrong in his interactions with Ukraine\u2019s president (52 percent of indies agree). On the threshold question of whether Dems were right or wrong to open an impeachment inquiry, the public splits 52/45, with independents at 50/45. A CBS poll over the weekend found 55/45 support for an impeachment inquiry; another from Hill-HarrisX had it at 47/42, up 12 points since June. See what I mean by \u201cimpeachment-curious\u201d?\n\nBut there are two ominous numbers for Dems in the new Quinnipiac data. One is that the share of Americans who \u201cstrongly\u201d approve of Trump\u2019s job performance has now reached 35 percent, easily the highest figure recorded all year. Thirty-five percent isn\u2019t a lot in the abstract but it shows Republican support for Trump hardening as the pressure from impeachment builds. And if there\u2019s any doubt about that, consider that 68 percent of Republicans also answered \u201cno\u201d to the question, \u201cDo you think asking a foreign leader for help in defeating an opponent in an upcoming election is or is not a good enough reason to impeach a president and remove them from office?\u201d Out-and-out solicitation of election help isn\u2019t impeachable? Not to Republicans at this distinctive moment in time.\n\nHere\u2019s the other ominous number for lefties:\n\nAmericans may be impeachment-curious but they\u2019re also highly skeptical of Democratic motives here, which they should be. How much support can Dems realistically build among independents if it\u2019s already baked into their opinion that Team Blue is playing politics with all this?\n\nJust as I\u2019m writing this, CNN is out with its own poll on impeachment and removal. Their numbers, 47/45, are nearly identical to Quinnipiac\u2019s, and the trend line is again bad for Trump. In May, this same question earned a 41/54 split. An interesting detail:\n\nThe change since May has largely come among independents and Republicans. About three-quarters of Democrats favor impeaching Trump and removing him from office, roughly the same as in May, while among independents, support for impeachment and removal has risen 11 points to 46% among independents and 8 points to 14% among Republicans. The shift has also come notably among younger Americans. Sixty percent of those under age 35 now say they support impeaching Trump and removing him from office, up from 43% who felt that way in May, while support for the move among older Americans has held about even (42% now vs. 40% in May). Previous CNN polling on impeachment has not found such a stark gap by age. And that shift is concentrated on the GOP side. Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents under age 50, support for impeaching Trump and removing him from office has risen from 9% in May to 22% now, while views among older Republicans and Republican leaners have held about even with just 8% in favor of impeachment and removal from office.\n\nEven a minor shift within Trump\u2019s own party would turn impeachment into a majority proposition across the general population. He can\u2019t afford to lose Republican voters.\n\nOne more CNN number, which contradicts the Quinnipiac finding: \u201cAmericans are more likely to say that most congressional Democrats back impeachment because they believe Trump committed impeachable offenses (49%) than because they are out to get Trump at all costs (38%).\u201d We have one poll today telling us that Americans think Democrats are pursuing Trump for political ends and another telling us that they think Dems are chasing him on the merits. A lot depends on which one is correct. If Trump\u2019s \u201cwitch hunt\u201d defense isn\u2019t as effective in this case as it was during Russiagate, he\u2019s in bigger trouble than we think.", "description": "Divide.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/t-20.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
