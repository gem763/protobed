New home sales, which make up 11.5% of the housing market, declined 0.7% Reuters reported, and fewer people buying homes means they won't be spending money on fixing them up.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % HD THE HOME DEPOT INC. 234.38 +0.49 +0.21%\n\n\u201c[Home owners] are thinking twice about how much they\u2019re planning to spend. They\u2019re hesitant about really investing in their home in a major way, thinking about the types of materials [they\u2019re buying] \u2013 maybe choosing something that is not as pricey,\u201d Will said.\n\nAnd despite their national influence, reality home shows from networks like HGTV are proving to be more aspirational than realistic. Around 60% of people looking to purchase a home said they were willing to find a property that needs renovating with rising home costs making it harder to afford turn-key properties, according to a Move.com survey from April reported by Housingwire.com.\n\nThe home-and-garden cable network, known for home remodel shows like \"Flip or Flop,\" and \"Fixer Upper,\" targets a primarily 25 to a 54-year-old audience reaching nearly 100 million households beating out CNN in 2016 to become the third-most watched cable network behind FOX News and ESPN, Bloomberg reported at the time. But the shows don\u2019t seem to translate to more consumer spending, particularly with declining home sales.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re [home owners] excited about doing projects, but oftentimes these shows make it look so unrealistic as far as the cost of projects,\u201d Will said. \u201cThe costs are often DIY as opposed to what you pay a contractor and everything else overhead,\" Will said.\n\nREAL ESTATE SEMINARS BACKED BY HGTV STARS UNDER FIRE BY FTC\n\nIndeed, the average cost to remodel a home costs between $40,000 and $60,000, according to 2019 estimates from Remodelingcalculator.org. And homeowners spent between $5,350 and $13,670 on just a bathroom remodel while a kitchen remodel can cost between an estimated $7,520 and $25,320.\n\nThe flat growth in home improvement sales could impact stocks like Home Depot, Lowe\u2019s and Sherwin Williams.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Spending on home renovations is slated to decline for the first time in 10 years.", "authors": ["Jeanette Settembre"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/07/0/0/Detroit-Housing-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
