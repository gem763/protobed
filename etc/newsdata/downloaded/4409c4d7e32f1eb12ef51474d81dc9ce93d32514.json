No one is born anti-Semitic. The road to anti-Semitism is long. So prevention is crucial.\"\n\nThe government has said around 90% of the 1,800 incidents recorded against Jews last year were committed by individuals espousing far-right views.\n\n\"Right-wing extremism, as well as Islamist terrorism, is today one of the biggest security threats facing Germany,\" said Andrea Lindholz, head of the home affairs committee in the Bundestag lower house. \"The main challenge is the fight against the boundless hate on the internet. The internet should not remain in a legal vacuum.\"\n\nGermany two years ago introduced laws allowing fines of up to 50 million euros ($55.57 million) on social media sites that fail to remove hate messages promptly. The new rules prompted Facebook to delete thousands of posts deemed as hate speech.\n\nGermany's domestic intelligence agency estimates there are around 24,100 \"right wing extremists\" in Germany, about half of whom are potentially violent.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Joseph Nasr; Editing by Alexandra Hudson)", "description": "The German cabinet on Wednesday approved measures to fight right-wing political violence, including tougher rules on gun ownership and stricter monitoring of hate speech online, responding to a rise in hate crime by militant extremists.
