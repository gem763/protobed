I hope you can relate | CBC News", "language": "en", "text": "Dr. Boluwaji Ogunyemi says it is wrong to dismiss someone's credibility because they have an accent, whether that accent comes from another part of Canada or another country. (Ritche Perez)\n\nCanada is seen worldwide as a diverse, progressive nation. In a country with two official languages \u2014 where pluralism is practised and where multiculturalism has been adopted as official government policy \u2014 our status may seem well-deserved.\n\nHowever, recent comments by an Alberta justice belie our reputation.\n\nThose comments also should resonate in my home province of Newfoundland and Labrador, where people have all too often been mocked for how they talk.\n\nLast month, Justice Terry Clackson wrote a decision \u2014 finding Alberta parents Collet and David Stephan not guilty of failing to provide the necessaries of life for their late son \u2014 that drew the ire of many.\n\nIt is disconcerting that a factor of his decision was the accent and manner of speech of the Crown's medical expert witness.\n\n\"His ability to articulate his thoughts in an understandable fashion was severely compromised by: his garbled enunciation; his failure to use appropriate endings for plurals and past tenses; his failure to use the appropriate definite and indefinite articles; his repeated emphasis on the wrong syllables; dropping his Hs; mispronouncing his vowels; and the speed of his responses,\" Clackson wrote.\n\nDr. Bamidele Adeagbo conducted the autopsy on Ezekiel Stephan, and determined that he died of bacterial meningitis. (In an earlier trial, the boy's parents, who had given Ezekiel herbal remedies, had been found guilty of depriving their son of treatment that could have saved his life.)\n\nAs a physician of Nigerian ancestry, as an immigrant and, most important, as a Canadian, I am dispirited and surprised by the justice's comments.\n\nI hope that his statement does not set a precedent in our pluralistic nation. With fears of populism bleeding into Canada from below the 49th parallel, we should think twice before disregarding substance for a lack of flair or overlooking expert opinion because of an accent, different pronunciations or grammatical mistakes that may be displeasing to the ear.\n\nWhat if the medical expert had a thick accent akin to that of some Newfoundland and Labrador residents \u2014 one that is sometimes met with bemusement?\n\nPut another way, we must not throw the baby out with the proverbial bathwater.\n\nWhat if the medical expert had a thick accent akin to that of some Newfoundland and Labrador residents \u2014 one that is sometimes met with bemusement? After all, H-dropping and H-insertion, as cited by Justice Clackson, are quite common here, especially those from more rural locales.\n\nThe message the judge sends is clear. If even a specialist physician's expert opinion is to be reduced in court because of an accent and manners of speech, then how can others who are not furnished by Dr Adeagbo's credentials be taken seriously?\n\nA call to do better\n\nLess than 800 kilometres from the Stephans' home in Glenwood, Alta., 400 physicians of Nigerian ancestry in Canada (a small fraction of the total number practising in this country) convened in Kelowna for the 2019 meeting of the Canadian Association of Nigerian Physicians and Dentists.\n\nEven if we consider Alberta alone, we quickly learn that physicians who are Nigerian immigrants serve the public by diagnosing and managing patients in over a dozen specialties, from family medicine to obstetrics to pediatrics.\n\nImmigrant physicians work in every medical setting in Canada and are overrepresented in underserviced communities. Indeed, hundreds of physicians employ a similar accent and manner of speech as Dr. Adeagbo when they counsel patients with cancer, manage children with birth complications, and comfort patients during their final hours.\n\nJustice Terry Clackson, right, found David and Collet Stephan, left, not guilty of failing to provide the necessaries of life to 19-month-old Ezekiel. (The Canadian Press/Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta)\n\nWhile training on the mainland, I found myself regularly defending Newfoundland when disparaging \"jokes\" and comments were made about being from the island or about the accent of her people.\n\nWe should refrain from dismissing credibility because someone has an accent \u2014 whether they're from a different region of Canada or a different part of the globe.\n\nWhile it is comforting that dozens of academics, lawyers and physicians nationwide have signed a formal petition sent to the Canadian Judicial Council to condemn Judge Clackson's remarks, I am buoyed more by the denunciation on the part of everyday individuals through social media and other fora.\n\nFrom Quebec's ban on religious symbols by public service workers to awaiting the results of our country's readiness to vote for the first visible minority to permanently lead a major national political party, Canada continues to face issues related to cultural integration, pluralism and tolerance.\n\nOgunyemi is a St. John's dermatologist who also works at Memorial University's medical school. (Riche Perez)\n\nWe should refrain from dismissing credibility because someone has an accent \u2014 whether they're from a different region of Canada or a different part of the globe. As Canadians, we should endeavour to continually improve the tolerance and inclusiveness that characterizes Canada.\n\nBetter is always possible.\n\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador", "description": "An Alberta judge\u2019s critique of a forensic pathologist\u2019s dropping of Hs and mispronouncing vowels hurt deeply, and does not bode well for Canada\u2019s proud heritage of pluralism, writes physician Boluwaji Ogunyemi.", "authors": ["Dr. Boluwaji Ogunyemi Is A Writer", "Dermatologist", "Clinical Assistant Professor Of Medicine At Memorial University."], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5328077.1571569285!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/boluwaji-ogunyemi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
