Lawmakers are set to meet Saturday to debate a deal.\n\n\u201cWhat -- beyond Boris Johnson\u2019s desire to meet his self-imposed deadline -- is the rush,\u201d the English tax lawyer said in a tweet.\n\nParliament is being asked to approve a 500-page document that it hasn\u2019t seen \u201cwith epochal consequences for Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the EU,\u201c he said. He uncharacteristically second guessed whether to file the suit, saying he would \u201cpause and reflect and take soundings\u201d before making a final decision.\n\nMaugham, who got the courts to quash the prime minister\u2019s suspension of Parliament, plans to return to Scotland for the latest case. He intends to seek an injunction in the Court of Session in Edinburgh \u201cpreventing the government from placing the Withdrawal Agreement before Parliament for approval,\u201d he said. The suit will be heard Friday morning, he said.\n\nIn addition, legal challenges are already mounting in case Johnson fails to get his deal approved in Parliament. Liberty, a civil rights group, will ask a London court Friday morning to force the prime minister to seek a Brexit extension rather than take the country out of the EU without a deal.\n\nLiberty said in a statement that the motion seeks to ensure that the government follows the Benn Act, which requires Johnson to seek an extension if faced with no-deal.\n\n\u201cIf a full hearing goes ahead, Liberty will ask the court to declare the PM\u2019s current position is unlawful and that he cannot take steps which would be likely to result in the EU refusing to agree an extension request, as required by the Benn Act,\u201d the civil rights group said in a statement.\n\n(Updates Liberty challenge in fifth paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jonathan Browning in London at jbrowning9@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Anthony Aarons at aaarons@bloomberg.net, Christopher Elser\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our\u00a0Brexit\u00a0Bulletin, follow us @Brexit\u00a0and\u00a0subscribe to our podcast.The lawyer who spearheaded successful challenges to Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan is preparing another lawsuit.This time, attorney Jolyon Maugham hopes to use what he sees as a legal breach in taxation legislation", "authors": ["Jonathan Browning"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rGDqKVNw8pfH9xxM1MlVIA--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/e06144d6520f80cc07d56b4eca2eea9b", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
