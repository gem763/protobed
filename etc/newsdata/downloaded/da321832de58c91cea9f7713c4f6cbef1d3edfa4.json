They played an important role in the American military campaigns in Europe and the Pacific during World War Two\n\nThis particular bomber did not see any action. It rolled off the assembly line in 1945, just as the war ended\n\nPrior to the air show, the Blue Angels did practice drills with a B-29 Superfortress, the historic 1940s era bomber that is one of just two remaining models that can still fly.\n\nThe plane was called 'Doc' because it was assigned to the Radar Calibration squadron known as 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.'\n\nIn the Disney story, Doc is the leader of the Seven Dwarfs.\n\nThe plane was left idle in California's Mojave Desert, where local animals took shelter in its fuselage.\n\nBut Tony Mazzolini, a former B-29 flight engineer, decided to start the process of salvaging the bomber.\n\nHundreds of volunteers, including skilled retirees from Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems, veterans, and active duty military service members, worked to restore the bomber.\n\nIt took more than 15 years to turn Doc into a functioning airplane that offers educational rides to aviation enthusiasts.\n\nDoc tours the United States as part of a mission to keep alive the memory of World War Two-era warbirds.\n\n'That\u2019s the special thing about touring with a B-29 is running into B-29 Veterans,' Josh Wells, the general manager of Doc\u2019s Friends, told KPNX-TV.\n\n'Some of them cry with joy. They\u2019re just overcome with emotion and they tell us their stories.\n\n'That really is the magical part about touring with Doc and the reason why we restored the airplane.'", "description": "The US Navy Blue Angels put on a spectacular display over the skies of Sacramento as they flew practice runs with a historic B-29 superfortress before this weekend's California Capital Airshow.", "authors": ["Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/17/19404112-0-image-a-43_1570464916787.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
