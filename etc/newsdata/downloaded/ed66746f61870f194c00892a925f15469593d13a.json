This issue is non-negotiable,\" he added.\n\nTsai went on to note the Opium Wars and Japan's invasion of China as historical examples for why the Chinese psyche has \"heavy baggage\" toward threats to sovereignty.\n\n\"I don't know Daryl personally. I am sure he's a fine NBA general manager, and I will take at face value his subsequent apology that he was not as well informed as he should have been. But the hurt this incident has caused will take a long time to repair,\" wrote Tsai.\n\nTsai was born in Taiwan, holds a Canadian passport and went to high school and university in the United States.\n\nTsai was a key dealmaker early in Alibaba's rise as China's largest e-commerce platform, and now serves as its executive vice chairman. He completed the purchase of a 49% stake in the Brooklyn Nets in 2018 and bought the remaining shares of the company last month.\n\nAlibaba did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe recent wave of protests in Hong Kong originated as a means to oppose a now-withdrawn extradition bill.\n\nThey have since continued as demonstrators express concern over Beijing's perceived increasing influence over the city, which they feel violates the \"one country, two systems\" status the city was promised when Britain handed it over to the People's Republic of China in 1997.
