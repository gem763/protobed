The usual extents of rivers are shown in white. Farmland , much of which was so drenched that farmers had to delay planting, is shown in green.\n\nThis year\u2019s flooding across the Midwest and the South affected nearly 14 million people, yet the full scale of the slowly unfolding disaster has been difficult to fathom. To visualize just how extensive it was, The New York Times created this composite map showing all the areas that were inundated at some point from January through June.\n\nPublic interest in natural disasters tends to focus on big, discrete weather events like hurricanes. But flooding that unfolds over months across a broad area has a harder time breaking through. It is only when seen as a single, connected event that the stunning scale of the 2019 flood season becomes clear\n\nTo measure the scope of the spring floods, The New York Times analyzed satellite data from the Joint Polar Satellite System using software, developed by government and academic researchers for flood detection, that is frequently used in disaster response.\n\nThe data covers the period from Jan. 15 to June 30 and shows an interconnected catastrophe along the Missouri, Mississippi and Arkansas Rivers, a system that drains more than 40 percent of the landmass of the continental United States.\n\nAreas that flooded NORTH DAKOTA Missouri River MINNESOTA WISCONSIN SOUTH DAKOTA IOWA NEBRASKA ILLINOIS Arkansas River KANSAS MISSOURI TENNESSEE ARKANSAS OKLAHOMA Mississippi River LOUISIANA TEXAS MISSISSIPPI N.D.

As the water spread across parts of South Dakota, Nebraska and Iowa, traditional defenses that communities had in place to protect against rising waters were quickly overwhelmed.\n\nAs the high water from the many tributaries of the Mississippi came together, the river became a record-breaking monster.\n\nMajor flood stage sites, Jan. 15 to June 30 Federal assistance-approved counties NORTH DAKOTA Missouri River MINNESOTA WISCONSIN SOUTH DAKOTA IOWA NEBRASKA ILLINOIS Arkansas River KANSAS MISSOURI TENNESSEE ARKANSAS OKLAHOMA Mississippi River LOUISIANA TEXAS MISSISSIPPI N.D.

Forty-nine United States Geological Survey gauges measured more water this year than at any time in at least 20 years.\n\nBryan Tuma, assistant director of Nebraska\u2019s Emergency Management Agency, said, simply, \u201cI would describe it as biblical.\u201d\n\nFloodwaters spread across the town of Hamburg, Iowa, in March. Tim Gruber for The New York Times\n\nThe causes of flooding are complicated, but climate change is increasingly an exacerbating factor. Warmer air can hold more moisture, and that moisture can fall back out of the sky, whether as rain or snow, in greater amounts.\n\nThe year through May 2019 was the wettest 12-month period on record in the United States, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Nearly 38 inches of water fell, almost eight inches above average.\n\nFlooding outside of Fortescue, Mo., damaged the levee designed to hold back water. Tim Gruber for The New York Times\n\nA Mississippi River mayors council estimated that the cost of infrastructure damage and emergency response was at least $2 billion. That number is likely to rise as the water recedes and officials can check the extent of the damage. The full cost to repair homes and businesses has yet to be calculated.\n\nDavid Alexander, a professor of risk and disaster reduction at University College London, said that typical recovery times from major disasters are \u201cin the range of 10 to 25 years.\u201d\n\nA boat made its way through a flooded street in Grafton, Ill., in May. Whitney Curtis for The New York Times\n\nUltimately, the volume of water is only one source of damage: What\u2019s in that water also plays a role.\n\nThe waters of the Mississippi, carrying chemical fertilizers from heartland farms, lawns and other sources, have contributed to a \u201cdead zone\u201d in the Gulf of Mexico, an area with too little oxygen to support fish and other marine life.\n\nNOAA predicts that this year's dead zone will be 8,717 square miles \u2014 about the size of New Hampshire.\n\nFarms in the lower Mississippi Delta remained underwater in June. Rory Doyle for The New York Times\n\nBack in March, Edward Clark, director of NOAA\u2019s National Water Center, said that what lay ahead was a \u201cpotentially unprecedented\u201d flood season, even worse than the Great Flood of 1993.\n\nIn a recent interview, Mr. Clark said, with no satisfaction, \u201cYes, we got it right.\u201d\n\nSixty-three percent of comparable United States Geological Survey gauges in the region recorded higher peaks this year than in the same period of 1993.\n\n\u201cThis is a year that will remain in our cultural memory, in our history,\u201d he said.", "description": "A New York Times analysis shows how far this spring\u2019s unprecedented floods spread.", "authors": ["Sarah Almukhtar", "Blacki Migliozzi", "John Schwartz", "Josh Williams"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/11/us/midwest-floods-promo-1568220557752/midwest-floods-promo-1568220557752-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
