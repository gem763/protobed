He added that US forces took with them \"substantial parts\" of his body.\n\n\"As I said, they brought body parts back with them, etc., etc. There wasn't much left,\" he told reporters. \"The \u2014 the vest blew up, but there are still substantial pieces that they brought back.\"\n\nTrump and the US military have separately hinted that the US would release footage of the secretive al-Baghdadi operation, though it's not clear what part of the mission it would be.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump tweeted a photo of a military dog involved in the raid.", "description": "Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces adviser Polat Can shared behind-the-scenes details of the US raid on Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.", "authors": ["Alexandra Ma"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db7338adee01927622ca304?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
