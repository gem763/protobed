Jones revealed Heinz was in tears in the dressing room after the match against the All Blacks but the head coach said Owen Farrell, Jonny May and Kyle Sinckler will all be fit to face the Springboks. \u201c[Jonny May is] pretty good. We had a walk through this morning and we had to tell Jonny to slow down a bit,\u201d added Jones. \u201cHe is probably in better condition that he was last week [when he had a hamstring injury] at this stage. Immeasurably better. Owen is a bit sore but he will be fine. We have got a few others carrying bumps and bruises because it was a tough old game.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest England captain Owen Farrell is on course to make the final against South Africa.

It\u2019s tough for him but he\u2019s now collected himself, he now knows he\u2019s got another role to play for us and he\u2019ll fulfil that role really well this week.\n\nEddie Jones tells England to find another level to win Rugby World Cup | Gerard Meagher Read more\n\n\u201cBen has been in and around the squad consistently for the last couple of years so he knows the game, he knows the players. He is a fit guy and just fits in quite readily. We always said to those guys outside the 31 that they need to be ready, and he is ready to go.\n\n\u201cIt is just a great opportunity ahead of him. He has come into the squad and has got to learn a few new things. Willi will help him and Benny will help him with that. The task ahead of him is no different to any other player. He has just got to learn a little bit more in the early part of the week and get himself physically and mentally ready.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, amid reports of fans paying over the odds for tickets to the final and a surge in demand for flights to Japan, Jones saluted his side\u2019s supporters and acknowledged England were giving fans a welcome distraction amid political chaos back in the UK. \u201cI think it\u2019s great, you give the country something to cheer about and with Brexit at the moment they probably need something to cheer about,\u201d said Jones. \u201cIt\u2019s a job of the team to make the country happy, not as happy as they can be, because there is still a game to go. The crowds here generally at the World Cup have been fantastic and I thought our supporters on Saturday night were massively instrumental in getting us home. Their singing, their general support of the team were fantastic and we urge them to keep doing that.\u201d", "description": "Eddie Jones has hit back at Warren Gatland after the Wales head coach had suggested England have peaked too early in their pursuit of the World Cup", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/609bded1807a39fb54c954fb9501e710387c185c/0_17_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=876a31a0c33dd27587ca7f52e81f0e7b", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
