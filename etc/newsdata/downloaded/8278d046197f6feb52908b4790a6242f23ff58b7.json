The creatures are carnivores with strong jaws and both males and females have a pouch in which they hold their babies, like other marsupials like the kangaroo.\n\nAlthough there is no official reason for the extinction of the thylacine, it's likely that their numbers dwindled after being extensively hunted by humans and dealing with increased competition from a growing dingo population.\n\nIf it turns out that thylacines actually have gone extinct, there's still hope for those who wish to see one; the Australian Museum replicated thylacine DNA back in 2002, making it potentially possible to bring the mysterious creature back to life.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "These sightings, if true, would reverse the belief that the carnivore has gone extinct.", "authors": ["Daisy Hernandez"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8ykFkF5Vg7HujSlvLc61aQ--~B/aD03MjI7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/popular_mechanics_642/1111d2aeaf580c1d31835d396de8739c", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
