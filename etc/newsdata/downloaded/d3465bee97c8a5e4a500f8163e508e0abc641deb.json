But it could allow negotiators to meet before the next round of tariffs, raising the potential for that increase to be averted.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

laws infringed too much on Chinese sovereignty.\n\nSince then, Trump has moved ahead with taxing an additional $112 billion (\u00a390bn) of Chinese products, and he was expected to raise tariffs even further on October 1. China imposed additional tariffs on $75 billion (\u00a360bn) worth of US goods in retaliation.\n\nTensions between the two sides have eased slightly in recent weeks, with Chinese officials agreeing to travel to the United States in October for the next round of talks.\n\nOn Wednesday, China published a short list of US products that would be exempt from its new tariffs, and said it would announce more exemptions in coming weeks.\n\nThe exemptions included cancer drugs and certain chemicals that China does not produce domestically, but it did not include US exports like pork and soybeans, which have been targeted by Beijing as punishment for Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It was a big move. People were shocked. I wasn\u2019t shocked.\u201d\n\nOn other fronts, the Trump administration continues to move ahead with more stringent treatment of China.\n\nThe administration has drafted an executive order that would increase inspections of mailed packages, in an effort to crack down on shipments of counterfeit goods and deadly drugs from foreign nations including China.\n\nThe order would empower the US Postal Service to increase inspections of small packages that arrive in the country by air, according to several people familiar with the draft, who declined to be named because they were not authorised to speak publicly.\n\nThat would help to close a loophole that has allowed dangerous drugs like the opioid fentanyl and other contraband to pass into the United States unchecked.\n\nThe measure is not aimed specifically at China. But Trump has often accused China of failing to stop shipments of fentanyl from flowing into the United States.\n\nTrump said late last month that he was directing the Postal Service and private US companies like FedEx, Amazon and UPS to search packages from China for fentanyl and refuse delivery.\n\nOn 1 September, Trump placed more tariffs on Chinese imports as punishment for Beijing\u2019s failure to stop fentanyl shipments and its refusal to buy more agricultural goods from the United States.\n\n\u201cFentanyl kills 100,000 Americans a year. President Xi said this would stop \u2013 it didn\u2019t,\u201d Trump said in a tweet last month, referring to Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president.\n\nThe executive order would apply solely to the Postal Service, not private companies like FedEx or UPS.\n\nThe order is drafted to apply to all countries, though the effects would fall most heavily on China, a major source of both counterfeit products and fentanyl as well as small packages shipped into the United States.\n\nRegarding the trade talks, China and the United States appear to still have substantive differences. Chinese officials have emphasised recent changes they have made to laws governing foreign investment and intellectual property, rather than discussing the more significant changes the Trump administration has demanded.\n\nTrump has ordered US companies out of China and expressed satisfaction at the damage his tariffs are wreaking on its economy.\n\nBusiness leaders said they are already struggling under the tariffs, and predict lower profits and wage cuts if further levies \u2013 more are set for December \u2013 go into place.\n\nA poll by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai published Wednesday said the trade war was weighing on its members\u2019 projections for revenue growth, optimism about the future and future investment plans.\n\nMoody\u2019s Analytics estimates that the trade war has already cost 300,000 US jobs, a toll that could increase to nearly 450,000 by the end of this year and nearly 900,000 jobs by the end of next year, assuming Trump\u2019s planned tariff increases go into effect.\n\nIn recent months, some of the focus has shifted away from the terms of the trade deal itself to whether there can be an interim agreement that would involve Chinese purchases of US agricultural products and smooth over relations between the countries.\n\nChinese officials and their contacts have floated the idea of restarting agricultural purchases, in return for the United States postponing further tariff increases and offering some relief for Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant that has been blacklisted from buying US products, several people familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "Donald Trump said on Wednesday night that the United States would delay its next planned tariff increase on China by two weeks, as \u201ca gesture of goodwill\u201d that may help to mend the seriously damaged ties between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.", "authors": ["Ana Swanson"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/12/08/donald-trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
