In the other, his wife weighing in to take a deep breath.\n\nAll that feedback before Kovacs\u2019 final toss at world championships came from the same person. Kovacs\u2019 wife is his coach, as well.\n\nAfter winning a gold medal Saturday night, he owes her dinner. Maybe two.\n\n\u201cShe earned it,\u201d Kovacs said. \u201cI owe her big time for this one.\u201d\n\nKovacs threw a championship-record 22.91 meters and took home the gold by 1 centimeter. Teammate Ryan Crouser was second and Tomas Walsh of New Zealand took third with throws (each went 22.90) that would\u2019ve won any other world championship.\n\nTo think, Kovacs was recently contemplating retirement. His wife, Ashley, the throws coach at Ohio State, talked him out of it.\n\n\u201cWe put together this plan,\u201d said Kovacs, the 2016 Olympic silver medalist. \u201cTo not only to be back on top, but to be better.\u201d\n\nThe 30-year-old Kovacs knew he unleashed a technically sound throw on his final attempt, but he had no idea it was that good. He was shocked to see the distance. Crouser and Walsh had personal-best performances, too.\n\n\u201cIt was an unbelievable competition with a lot of fireworks,\u201d said Crouser, who made the rounds after winning a medal in a stylish cowboy hat. \u201cThis final was crazy and I am so happy to be part of it.\u201d\n\nThe key for Kovacs? Focusing on his lane - or, more apt in this case, the shot-put ring.\n\n\u201cI was proud able to stay in my own head and not watch Ryan and Tom throw it so far and get tight,\u201d said Kovacs, who won a world title in 2015. \u201cBeing a shot putter it\u2019s really easy to get tense. You really want to be intense and loose.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s where his wife plays a big role. They\u2019re honest with each other. At practice, if he doesn\u2019t feel like a particular workout, they skip it.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018You see me more than anybody else and you know when I\u2019m down. I can\u2019t pull one over on you,\u201d said Ashley Kovacs, who was an All-American shot putter at the University of Kentucky. \u201cThe type of honesty we have in our relationship has really helped us in this realm.\u201d\n\nCHAMPION OUT, PART I\n\nAfter a flinch, U.S. hurdler Brianna McNeal was finished.\n\nAt first, the Olympic champion didn\u2019t believe she was the one who bolted early from the blocks in the first round of the 100 hurdles. She shook her head when the judge informed her that she false started.\n\nThey went to the video. Indeed, she did. McNeal left the track in tears as her heat went on without her.\n\n\u201cI am very heartbroken by this mistake that I made,\u201d McNeal said. \u201cUnfortunately, I lost focus for just a millisecond.\u201d\n\nMcNeal\u2019s false start was a first-round lesson for the field.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw it, I was saying to myself and the other girls, \u2018Just wait on the gun. It doesn\u2019t matter if you have a slower reaction time,\u2019\u201d Jamaican Danielle Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely tough to see something like that happen.\u201d\n\nCHAMPION OUT, PART II\n\nDefending world long jump champion Brittney Reese of the United States struggled to explain what happen. She was jittery on her first jump, played it safe on the final one and barely missed the last spot in the final.\n\nHer jump of 6.52 meters was just 1 centimeter behind U.S. teammate Sha\u2019keela Saunders, who earned the last spot in Sunday\u2019s final.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my day,\u201d said Reese, who also won world titles in 2009 and 2013. \u201cEverything felt like it was heading in the right direction. I didn\u2019t execute the plan. It\u2019s totally my fault.\u201d\n\nShe said all she wanted to do was return to her room and punch her bed - or pillow.\n\n\u201cBecause once I punch something, I\u2019ll be all right,\u201d Reese said.\n\nCHAMPION OUT, PART III\n\nGerman javelin thrower Thomas Rohler failed to make it out of qualifying. He won gold at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games.\n\n\u201cIf javelin was easy, then victories would not be worth anything,\u201d Rohler said. \u201cThis will hurt for some hours.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "In one ear, American shot putter Joe Kovacs heard a technical tip from his coach.
