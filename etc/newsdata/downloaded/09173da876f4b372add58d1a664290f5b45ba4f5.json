Do they fear the American people will discover that the Democrats are conducting an unfair, partisan investigation?\n\nDAVID BOSSIE: BASELESS TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY BY DESPERATE DEMOCRATS MAKES DRAMATIC FLIP-FLOP\n\nThe Democratic resolution is expected to be approved by the full House on Thursday \u2013 despite strong Republican objections.\n\nRepublicans contend there is no \"existing\" impeachment inquiry because the full House has never voted to approve one \u2013 and even the new resolution doesn\u2019t explicitly open such an investigation. This is a dramatic departure from what happened when the full House voted to open impeachment inquiries of Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.\n\nPresident Trump and Republicans have raised strong objections to the fact that the current impeachment inquiry of Trump began with the approval of only a single person \u2013 Speaker Pelosi. She directed six different House committees to launch the impeachment probe.\n\nCrucially, the Constitution gives the \u201csole Power of Impeachment\u201d to the House of Representatives \u2013 not the speaker of the House. This is a major point that Democrats are glossing over as an insignificant technicality.\n\nIn the impeachment inquiries of Presidents Nixon and Clinton, Democrats and Republicans took a very different position than Pelosi, D-Calif., is taking today. That\u2019s why there were votes by the entire House putting every member on record on whether an impeachment inquiry should be opened.\n\nThose resolutions were approved and authorized the House Judiciary Committee \u2013 not six different committees \u2013 to conduct impeachment inquiries.\n\nPage 614 of the 2017 manual on the \u201cRules, Precedents, and Procedures of the House\u201d \u2013 written by the three individuals who have been the parliamentarians of the House of Representative since 1994 \u2013 states that under \u201cthe modern practice, an impeachment is normally instituted by the House by the adoption of a resolution calling for a committee investigation of charges against the [federal] officer in question.\u201d\n\nThis means that Pelosi has violated the modern practice of the House by not having the entire body vote on such a resolution.\n\nSo what about the resolution that is expected to come to a vote of the full House on Thursday? This resolution doesn\u2019t say it is to authorize the start of an impeachment investigation, as House Res. 581 did in the case of Bill Clinton.\n\nInstead, the new resolution directs the six committees of the House to \u201ccontinue their ongoing investigations.\u201d But why schedule a vote on a resolution to tell committees to keep doing what they are already doing?\n\nThe new resolution also falls short of providing the type of fairness and right to participate in the investigation that the minority party \u2013 the Republicans \u2013 are asking for and are entitled to.\n\nOne of the other criticisms of Pelosi\u2019s lack of a full House vote has been that there was no resolution setting out the rules under which the impeachment inquiry would proceed, including the rights of the minority party. Both the Clinton and Nixon resolutions did that.\n\nAgain, this is not a minor technicality. It is a major issue.\n\nThe new resolution lays out rules governing the discovery process \u2013 issuing subpoenas, submitting questions, etc. \u2013 but only for two of the six committees: the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees.\n\nSo the other four committees \u2013 Financial Services, Foreign Affairs, Oversight and Reform, and Ways and Means \u2013 can continue to operate however they want to, in secret, denying the minority members the ability to fully participate.\n\nEven in the rules set out for the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, Pelosi has changed the rules from the Clinton inquiry to, in essence, give the Democrats a one-sided advantage.\n\nUnder the Clinton resolution, H.R. 581, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the ranking minority member could issue subpoenas for witnesses and documents by acting \u201cjointly.\u201d In other words, they acted together to decide who to subpoena and what documents to obtain. If one of them disagreed, the other member had to first refer the matter to the committee before acting on his own.\n\nThe House resolution approving an investigation of President Nixon, H.R. 803, had the exact same rule.\n\nIf Democrats want the American people to believe they are conducting an objective, nonpartisan investigation, they need to start acting as if they are. The latest resolution they are proposing falls far short of doing that.\n\nBut the Pelosi resolution gives the chairmen of the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees the power to act unilaterally \u2013 without the approval of the ranking Republican member.\n\nIf a Republican wants to issue subpoenas, he or she can only do so with the concurrence of the chairman \u2013 that is, the member has to ask: chairman, may I?\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIf the chairman refuses to agree, the Republican can submit his or her request to the entire committee. But since the Democrats control both committees, is there really anyone out there who thinks they would override Chairmen Adam Schiff, D-Calif., or Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.?\n\nOne final note. There has been a great deal of discussion about witnesses being questioned in secret and the fact that members of other committees given jurisdiction over the impeachment inquiry have been barred from participating in the questioning being conducted by the Intelligence Committee.\n\nWhile it is true that congressional committees sometimes question witnesses behind closed doors, there is no reason to do so here. In fact, in a matter as serious and as important as the possible removal of a duly elected president, fundamental principles of fairness and the democratic process demand that such an inquiry be conducted in as transparent a manner as possible.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFurther, there is no reason for the Intelligence Committee to question witnesses in secret when there is no classified information being discussed \u2013 and the details of the telephone conversation that President Trump had with the president of Ukraine are not classified. And why are members of other committees being barred from participating?\n\nIf Democrats want the American people to believe they are conducting an objective, nonpartisan investigation, they need to start acting as if they are. The latest resolution they are proposing falls far short of doing that.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY HANS VON SPAKOVSKY", "description": "In the impeachment inquiries of Presidents Nixon and Clinton, Democrats and Republicans took a very different position than House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is taking today.", "authors": ["Hans Von Spakovsky", "Hans A.
