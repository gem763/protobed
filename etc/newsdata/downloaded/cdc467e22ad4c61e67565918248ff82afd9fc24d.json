Joe Ross will take his place.\n\nScherzer says his neck spasms started over the last few days and he got treatment in an effort to be ready to pitch. But he says he woke up Sunday morning and couldn\u2019t get out of bed. He had to fall out of bed and push himself up with his left arm.\n\nThe three-time Cy Young Award winner had a cortisone shot in hopes of being ready for a possible Game 7.\n\nScherzer says he texted Ross to let him know he would be starting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m as disappointed as I possibly can be not to be able to pitch tonight. It\u2019s Game 5 of the World Series,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cI\u2019ve pitched through so much crap in my career that that would be easy to pitch through at this point. This is literally impossible to do anything with.\u201d\n\n___\n\n5:36 p.m.\n\nRookie Yordan \u00c1lvarez was back in the Astros\u2019 starting lineup for Game 5 of the World Series against the Washington Nationals.\n\n\u00c1lvarez, who hit 27 homers in 87 regular season games, was batting sixth and playing left field. He was the designated hitter in Games 1 and 2 but was benched as the series moved to the NL ballpark.\n\nCatcher Robinson Chirinos, who homered in Games 3 and 4, was benched for the Astros. Martin Maldonado was behind the plate with Gerrit Cole pitching in a repeat of the Game 1 battery.\n\nWith scheduled starter Max Scherzer scratched for Washington with spasms near his neck, his preferred catcher Kurt Suzuki was on the bench for the second straight night.

As part of protocol, the clubhouses were swept as a precaution.\n\n\u201cI think everybody is excited. It\u2019s the president of the United States,\u201d Strasburg said.\n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s obviously beefed up security,\u201d he said. \u201cSo usually the dogs that are sniffing in our clubhouse are these nice Labs that are super friendly. And today there was a German shepherd that I didn\u2019t really feel comfortable petting.\u201d\n\n___\n\n4:45 p.m.\n\nNationals pitcher Max Scherzer was scratched from his scheduled start in Game 5 of the World Series because of spasms near his neck.\n\nWashington manager Dave Martinez made the announcement 3\u00bd hours before the first pitch Sunday night.\n\nJoe Ross was scheduled to start in place of Scherzer.
