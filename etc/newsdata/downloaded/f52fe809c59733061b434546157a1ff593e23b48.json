There was always classical Indian music, full of sitars and harmoniums, blaring on the weekends. My father often changed into a traditional kurta shirt in the evenings, after work. Our home always carried the strong fragrances of the spices and herbs of my parents' favorite dishes, which seemed to permanently embed themselves into our furniture fabrics, clothes and even our skin.\n\nAnd, although neither of my parents was a doctor, they often treated me and my little brother with home remedies passed down to them over many generations. For example, to get us to calm down, my mom taught us an alternate nostril breathing technique. It's called Nadi Shodhana, and my mom, who is an engineer, had a very precise way of demonstrating it.\n\nSitting cross-legged with a super straight spine, she would bring her right hand in front of her face and gently lay her index and middle fingers on her forehead.
