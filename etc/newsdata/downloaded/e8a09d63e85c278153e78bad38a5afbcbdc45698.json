(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nThey don\u2019t ordinarily agree with each other. They watch different channels, hear different versions of the news and view neighbors across a gaping, painful political divide. But in swing districts across the country, the idea of impeaching the president has brought some Americans together: They\u2019re wary of deploying the Constitution\u2019s ultimate weapon \u2014 one that takes the decision about who is president out of voters\u2019 hands.\n\nDerek Tsao is a Republican in California who has grown tired of President Trump\u2019s behavior. Curtis Johnson is a Democrat in Florida who could never quite fathom why his fellow Americans chose a man like Trump. Lisa Foulds is a lifelong Republican in suburban Virginia whose kids have pushed her toward the center, so much so that she voted for a Democrat for Congress last year.\n\nThey all say the president may have crossed a line when he pressed his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate one of Trump\u2019s main political rivals. And despite their political differences, they say the Democrats\u2019 move this week to start impeachment proceedings against Trump is the wrong tactic at the wrong time.\n\nPolls have shown that public opinion has shifted slightly in favor of impeachment, but many still see it as \u201can exercise in futility,\u201d as Johnson put it.\n\nThe retired steelworker from Indiana, now living in New Smyrna Beach, Fla., said he\u2019s eager for Democrats to find a candidate who can beat Trump next year, but he fears that impeaching the president will make Trump\u2019s reelection more likely. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough time before the election and nothing will come of it,\u201d said Johnson, 71. \u201cThis is going to hurt the Democrats because everyone\u2019s going to say, \u2018You\u2019re putting all your energy into this?\u2019 \u201d\n\nTsao, 27, who is studying to be a physical therapist, has followed this week\u2019s news only glancingly, but he\u2019s all for investigating any credible accusations.\n\n\u201cIf a crime has been alleged, you should find out more about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI fear, though, that it\u2019s just another anti-Trump move.\u201d\n\nLaunching an investigation and potentially putting Trump on trial in the Senate strikes Foulds, a 50-year-old who still considers herself a Republican after voting for independent Gary Johnson in 2016, as \u201ca waste of the taxpayers\u2019 money.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor something as trivial as gaining dirt on somebody? It just seems petty,\u201d she said. \u201cI just think it has to be much more egregious.\u201d\n\nAs events in Washington unfolded at a breakneck pace this week, many Democrats and Republicans interviewed in swing districts across seven states were united in their exhaustion \u2014 with politics, with polarization and, even among some of his supporters, with the president. Many said they chose not to follow every twist and turn in the Ukraine story because their views about Trump had long ago solidified, pro or con.\n\nVoters across the partisan spectrum argued that next year\u2019s election \u2014 not impeachment \u2014 is the best way to resolve the country\u2019s struggle with a divisive, unpopular president who now stands accused of betraying the nation\u2019s interests.\n\nAn NPR-\u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d-Marist poll conducted Wednesday found that 49 percent of Americans supported opening an impeachment inquiry while 46 percent were opposed. And in a Huffington Post-YouGov poll completed Thursday, 47 percent said that \u201cTrump should be impeached and removed from office,\u201d up slightly from 43 percent earlier this month. The increase was driven more by increased support among Democrats than among independents.\n\nPolls taken earlier in the week, before details of the Ukraine call were known, showed somewhat less support for impeachment. In a Quinnipiac University survey completed on Monday, 37 percent of registered voters supported impeaching and removing the president; 57 percent were opposed, including nearly all Republicans, 58 percent of independents, and 21 percent of Democrats.\n\n\n\nProtesters call to impeach President Trump in front of the White House on Sept. 24.

(Carolyn Kaster/AP)\n\nA lose-lose\n\nRosa Kee can\u2019t stand Trump, but for a long time, she thought impeachment was the wrong idea: \u201cI really wanted us to vote him out, because otherwise he\u2019d say, \u2018This isn\u2019t what the people wanted.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut this week, Kee, a former telecom employee from Stone Mountain, Ga., changed her mind. Kee is now, grudgingly, okay with the Democrats pressing toward impeachment.\n\n\u201cThis feels different to me,\u201d said Kee, 73. \u201cBack when he said to Putin, \u2018Russia, if you\u2019re listening, go after Hillary,\u2019 I thought, \u2018Okay, that\u2019s just his ego talking.\u2019 But what he did to this Ukrainian guy, now he\u2019s using his position for his own interests.\u201d\n\nKee still doesn\u2019t like the idea of Congress removing Trump \u2014 a decision she thinks voters should make on their own \u2014 but she believes House Democrats are making a principled decision, even if she\u2019s certain it won\u2019t succeed.\n\n\u201cIt will help the Democrats because they finally did something about him,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I fear it will help Trump, too, because he\u2019s always making himself out to be the victim, and that always works for him.\u201d\n\nImpeachment \u2014 Congress\u2019s power to remove a president without a vote by the people \u2014 has never been popular. In the 1970s with Republican Richard Nixon and in the 1990s with Democrat Bill Clinton, a majority of Americans concluded that the president had behaved badly. But the country remained largely opposed to impeachment until shortly before Nixon resigned, and in Clinton\u2019s case, all the way through his acquittal by the Senate.\n\nIn Washington, the Ukraine story sucked the air out of every other issue. In Iowa and other early primary states, Democratic presidential candidates watched as news coverage pivoted from the campaign to impeachment. Political consultants and pundits shifted into hyper-speculation mode, urgently searching for clues about how the impeachment probe might alter the country\u2019s political path.\n\nIn swing districts, the Ukraine call and impeachment inquiry didn\u2019t seem quite the watershed events they were in the capital, but some voters welcomed the move.\n\n\n\nA woman views newspaper headlines announcing the acquittal of President Bill Clinton in February 1999 in Sacramento. Only three of President Trump\u2019s predecessors underwent impeachment proceedings: Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, who were acquitted after trials in the Senate, and Richard Nixon, who resigned to avoid being impeached in connection with the Watergate scandal. (Bob Galbraith/AP)\n\nIn the Yorba Linda, Calif., townhouse development where Frank Bryant lives, some neighbors no longer speak to each other because of their opposing views on Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s way too personal,\u201d so nobody talks politics anymore around the community pool, said Bryant, a professor of marketing at nearby Cal Poly Pomona.\n\nHe generally votes for Democrats, but he admires how Trump has managed the economy. Now, Bryant\u2019s ready to go along with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s decision to switch gears and embrace impeachment.\n\n\u201cI think we have to go with the speaker right now,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cShe\u2019s been very careful, and so, if she sees something there now, I believe her.\u201d\n\nVoters on both sides echoed Pelosi\u2019s concerns earlier this year that an impeachment drive could hurt Democrats. Trump supporters and opponents alike predicted that the move might strengthen Trump\u2019s reelection bid.\n\nThe modern history of impeachment demonstrates that a sitting president can indeed turn the tables on his accusers, said Frank O. Bowman III, a professor at the University of Missouri School of Law and author of \u201cHigh Crimes and Misdemeanors,\u201d a history of impeachment. Bowman said that Clinton effectively pressed his case in the news media, portraying his Republican opponents as bad guys who wanted to use his extramarital sexual affair to remove him from office.\n\n\u201cClinton managed to flip the public narrative from his own bad behavior to the behavior of those who attacked him,\u201d the historian said. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t need Clinton to teach him anything about fighting dirty. Any attempt to impeach Trump is going to invite the nastiest kinds of backlash, first of all against Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nIn St. Clair Shores, a sharply split district in Detroit\u2019s northern suburbs, Diana Rascano, 69, said she often votes for Democrats in local elections, where government \u201ctouches your life more than the feds.\u201d But in presidential votes, she\u2019s a consistent Republican because of her conservative views on abortion, immigration and taxes.\n\nThe transcript of the president\u2019s call with his Ukrainian counterpart sounded like standard business talk to her, not unlike what she recalls from her days as an executive at the Detroit Edison utility company.\n\nRascano said Democrats, some Republicans and the news media are acting as \u201cone big angry mob in . . . a constant barrage of trying to find a crime\u201d committed by Trump. As a result, she said, she\u2019s more supportive of the president in 2020 than she was in 2016.\n\n\n\nSmall-business owner Jason Scaggs, 36, touches up one of the many painted sentiments on his \u201cFlag Barn\u201d in Owings, Md., on Nov. 2, 2016. The barn, which dates to 1912, has signs that read: \u201cTrump \u2014 Make America Great Again,\u201d \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d and \u201cDedicated to Our Troops.\u201d (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post)\n\nSwitching sides\n\nIn northwestern Pennsylvania, Trump in 2016 became the first Republican presidential candidate to carry Erie County in more than three decades. White working-class voters abandoned their historical ties to the Democratic Party after manufacturing plants downsized or closed along Lake Erie\u2019s southern shore.\n\nBut last year, county voters shifted their loyalties back to Democrats as Gov. Tom Wolf and Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. both carried the county by about 20 points.\n\nIn Harborcreek, a working-class town just east of Erie city, many residents said they weren\u2019t paying much attention to the unfolding impeachment controversy in Washington.\n\nJim Cass, a 77-year-old retired bar owner who has been a Republican all his life, has never liked Trump and said the Ukraine matter has only validated his view.\n\n\u201cI think he is a liar and a cheat and I never trusted him with our foreign affairs,\u201d Cass said, \u201cand I don\u2019t like anything about him. Period.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s all for impeaching the president, but he isn\u2019t sure Congress will be able to amass sufficient evidence to get the job done, and he worries that the debate will deepen the nation\u2019s divisions.\n\nHe\u2019s certain the debate will exacerbate divisions within his own family. He has a son and a son-in-law \u201cwho loves Trump,\u201d but another son and a daughter-in-law who \u201cdon\u2019t have any use for him, either.\u201d\n\nBut Cass said the risk of more family fights is worth it if the result is removing from office the man he considers \u201cmentally ill.\u201d\n\nTo another Republican in Harborcreek, though, the move toward impeachment seems a recipe for a Trump victory in 2020. Randy Wienke, a 64-year-old truck driver, has been stuck in the house for several days recovering from back surgery \u2014 plenty of time to absorb details of the Ukraine story on Fox News.\n\nHe\u2019s concluded that Democrats are just out to remove Trump over a phone call that he said most voters don\u2019t care about. \u201cThey just don\u2019t like him, and they don\u2019t like him because he doesn\u2019t play into their little clique politics game there,\u201d Wienke said.\n\nHe\u2019s convinced that the \u201creal criminals\u201d are Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who have been the target of Trump\u2019s counterattack this week.\n\nEven if Trump did do something wrong, Wienke said, he doesn\u2019t understand why Democrats would rush to push him from office: \u201cWho would take his place? Mike Pence? They still would not be getting rid of any of his conservative, Republican political views.\u201d\n\nThe impeachment initiative has changed some minds \u2014 if not about Trump, then about the Democrats lining up against him.\n\nTom Shaw, 56, a fraud investigator in Henrico, Va., voted for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008, Republican Mitt Romney in 2012 and then Trump in the last election, in good part because he liked the idea of a businessperson managing the country.\n\n\u201cBusiness is tough and running this country is like a big business,\u201d Shaw said. He\u2019s been pleased to see Trump cut red tape, lower unemployment, reduce corporate tax rates and sign a criminal justice reform bill.\n\nBut Shaw switched gears last year to vote against his Republican congressman, Dave Brat, and choose Democrat Abigail Spanberger because she\u2019d served as a CIA officer and promised to work with Republicans.\n\nHe won\u2019t vote for her again, though, because of her strong advocacy for gun control \u2014 and because she announced her support for impeachment this week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to see her sit down and lay out the specific facts that are illegal involving Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll see. Maybe something comes out in the hearings. If there\u2019s evidence that Trump violated some law or did something unethical, I would vote to impeach him in a second.\u201d\n\nPortnoy reported from Chesterfield, Va.; Wilson from Yorba Linda, Calif.; Craig from Erie, Pa.; and Fisher from Washington.
