It was the president's, The New York Times reported, citing two sources that were investigating the hacks.\n\nIt was not clear what information - if anything - was taken.\n\nTim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign's communications director, told the newspaper that 'we have no indication that any of our campaign infrastructure was targeted.'\n\nCorporate vice president for security Tom Burt wrote in a blog post Friday that owners of four accounts that were successfully breached have been notified.\n\nHe said none of those were a U.S. presidential campaign.\n\nHe says the attacks by a group Microsoft calls Phosphorous occurred during a 30-day period in August and September.\n\nIranian hackers targeted Donald Trump's presidential campaign\n\nMicrosoft security expert Tom Burt said in a blog post on Friday that hackers had targeted several email accounts - including a presidential campaign, US officials and journalists. He would not reveal which presidential campaign was targeted\n\nThe Iranian government, led by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, did not issue any statement on the hacking attempt\n\nTrump was targeted as his administration weighs a cyberattack against Iran for an attack on Saudi oil facilities last month that the White House charges Tehran with doing.\n\nIn a 30-day period between August and September, the group, dubbed 'Phosphorous' by the company, made more than 2,700 attempts to identify consumer email accounts belonging to specific customers and then attacked 241 of those accounts.\n\nThe report of the attacks showed how cyber security will be a major issue in the 2020 election. Officials at the FBI and Department of Homeland Security have warned of the danger.\n\n'Four accounts were compromised as a result of these attempts; these four accounts were not associated with the U.S. presidential campaign or current and former U.S. government officials,' Burt wrote in the blog post.\n\n'Microsoft has notified the customers related to these investigations and threats and has worked as requested with those whose accounts were compromised to secure them.'\n\nHacking to interfere in elections has become a concern for governments, especially since U.S intelligence agencies concluded that Russia ran a hacking and propaganda operation to disrupt the American democratic process in 2016 to help then-candidate Trump become president. Moscow has denied any meddling.\n\nTensions between the United States and Iran have risen since May 2018 when Trump withdrew from a 2015 international nuclear accord with Tehran that put limits on its nuclear program in exchange for easing of sanctions. Trump has since reinstated U.S. sanctions, putting increased pressure on the Iranian economy, including its oil trade.\n\nThe Iranian government did not issue any immediate comment through state-run media on Microsoft's statement.\n\nPhosphorus is also known as APT 35, Charming Kitten, and Ajax Security Team, according to Microsoft.\n\nThe Redmond, Washington-based company said Phosphorous used information gathered from researching their targets or other means to game password reset or account recovery features and attempt to take over some targeted accounts.\n\nThe attacks were not technically sophisticated, the blog said. Hackers tried to use a significant amount of personal information to attack targets, it said.\n\n'This effort suggests Phosphorous is highly motivated and willing to invest significant time and resources engaging in research and other means of information gathering,' the blog post said.\n\nMicrosoft has been tracking Phosphorus since 2013 and said in March that it had received a court order to take control of 99 websites the group used to execute attacks.\n\nHillary Clinton's campaign was hacked by Russians in the 2016 election\n\nA computer network used by 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign was hacked in a cyberattack on Democratic Party political organizations in that U.S. election.\n\nBig tech companies are under pressure to ramp up security for next year's U.S. elections and others around the world.\n\nCompanies including Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc's Google, Microsoft and Twitter Inc met with U.S. intelligence agencies earlier in September to discuss security strategies.\n\nMicrosoft had said in a blog post in July that about 10,000 customers were targeted or compromised by nation-state attacks in the past year. Most of the activity originated from hackers in three countries: Iran, North Korea and Russia, the company said.", "description": "Iranian hackers targeted Donald Trump's presidential campaign as part of their attack on\u00a0government officials, media targets and prominent ex-patriate Iranians.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/22/19316642-0-image-a-10_1570225020129.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
