He too had begun receiving complaints and threats.\n\nOne threat involved an \u201cor else\u201d kind of message, threatening that if he doesn\u2019t obey then these radical leftists will \u201cbring out the guillotine to fix society\u201d:\n\n\u201cFair warning,\u201d it read, \u201cseveral community organizations are planning to shut down your showing of the Jordan Peterson propaganda film. While many of us aren\u2019t Christian and some even flat-out condemn the religion, we do not want any harm to come to your place of worship or those within. However, we cannot allow fascism to continue to rise and will not tolerate its presence in our city, whether it is on the streets or on the waterfront or in a church. Read some history books, read about eugenics, read about sex and gender and then compare it to Peterson. Pray on it if you must. Do the right thing. As much as we joke about it, we really don\u2019t want to have to bring out the guillotine to fix society.\u201d\n\nPeterson, a Toronto clinical psychologist and professor, achieved international fame when he became a central figurehead in the conversation of ethics and his opposition to identity politics and political correctness. This put him square into the crosshairs of hard-left activists and protesters. This includes Antifa, who often utilize violence to silence political opposition.\n\nThe reason the hard-left becomes so vehement about Peterson\u2019s silence is that much of what Peterson says makes sense, and as such, even members of the left find him appealing. Peterson is dangerous. He doesn\u2019t just change minds, he changes hearts, and those are two things the radical left would like to own.\n\nBut it also exposes the weakness of their position. If they can only retaliate to Peterson\u2019s words with violence for silence, then their arguments aren\u2019t very good. Peterson has already won the debate.\n\nWhile I doubt the radical left would pull out a literal guillotine (yet), I do believe they would resort to violence. The kind of violence that puts people in hospitals. Those screening the movie should continue to do so despite the threats, but make sure that security is a factor.\n\nSpeech shouldn\u2019t be silenced, whether it\u2019s Jordan Peterson or not, and shutting down showings of the movie isn\u2019t going to progress anything forward.", "description": "Leftists Threaten to \u201cBring Out the Guillotine\u201d If Theaters Show Jordan Peterson Documentary", "authors": ["Brandon Morse", "Susie Moore", "Alex Parker", "Nick Arama", "Elizabeth Vaughn", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/jordan-peterson-SCREENSHOT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
