Phil Scott said at a news conference Thursday that he wasn\u2019t surprised by the news that Trump repeatedly urged Ukraine\u2019s president to \u201clook into\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden because he\u2019s \u201cwatched him over the years.\u201d\n\nHe wants Congress to see the complete whistleblower allegations.\n\n\u201cI think the inquiry is important, yes, and where it leads from here is going to be driven by the facts that are established,\u201d Scott said.\n\nScott\u2019s remarks are one of the few signs of Republican discomfort with the revelations. Most Republicans elected officials have defended Trump, casting the controversy as ginned-up by Democrats \u2014 although the initial concerns were raised by an anonymous whistleblower \u2014 or describing it as much ado about nothing.\n\nScott, a popular moderate Republican in his second term in a deeply blue state, has broken from his party before. He has been a frequent Trump critic and repeatedly called for an end to the divisiveness in American politics. In July, Scott he said felt Trump\u2019s comments about four Democratic congresswomen of color were racist and not befitting for a world leader.\n\nA year ago, Scott was one of a handful of GOP governors who urged the U.S. Senate to delay a confirmation vote on then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh to allow time for an investigation into sexual misconduct allegations.\n\nScott has also opposed plans by the Trump administration to scale back climate change emissions, worked against a now-resolved trade dispute with Canada and has criticized Trump\u2019s immigration policy.\n\nOther moderate Republican governors have yet to weigh in on an impeachment inquiry.\n\nOhio Gov. Mike DeWine was a U.S. senator during impeachment proceedings against former Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1999 and he presided over the deposition of Monica Lewinsky. When asked by reporters what his stance on an impeachment inquiry is, he said he withheld judgment then, and he\u2019s withholding judgment now.\n\n\u201cWe have to wait until all the evidence is in,\u201d said DeWine, who is among statewide officials now co-chairing Trump\u2019s re-election campaign.\n\nHe ultimately voted guilty on both charges against Clinton.\n\nMassachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, both moderate GOP governors, have yet to comment.\n\nSeveral governors have appeared mindful of the unpredictable politics of impeachment as they weighed in from a distance this week. Democrats in swing states issued cautious endorsements of the Democrats\u2019 decision to launch the investigation. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a former congressman in a state Trump is trying to win, said he\u2019s worried about the wisdom of Democrats\u2019 move.\n\n\u201cIt may not be politically good to do because I think at this point I, like many Minnesotans, am so sick and tired of the dysfunction in D.C.,\u201d he said.\n\nScott spoke Thursday before details of the whistleblower complaint became known.\n\nThe complaint alleges that Trump abused the power of his office to \u201csolicit interference from a foreign country\u201d in next year\u2019s U.S. election. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nIn the complaint, the unnamed whistleblower acknowledges not hearing the president\u2019s call first-hand, but says he or she received information about it from \u201cmultiple U.S. officials.\u201d", "description": "A whistleblower complaint alleging Donald Trump sought to pressure the president of Ukraine in an official government call to investigate a key political rival has been made public, just days after the House opened a formal impeachment hearing against the president over those claims.", "authors": ["Clark Mindock", "Chris Baynes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/26/08/donald-trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
