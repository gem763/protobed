Police said the family of the 29-year-old Briton, who was living in Berlin, had been informed.\n\nThe exact circumstances of the accident, which took place on Invalidenstrasse, a road lined with restaurants and shops with a 30km/h (19mph) speed limit, were unclear. There has been speculation the driver, who is being treated in hospital for head wounds, may have experienced medical problems. Citing police sources, newspaper Tagesspiegel reported on Monday the man may have had an epileptic seizure.\n\nA 67-year-old woman and a six-year-old child were also travelling in the Porsche Macan.\n\nA spontaneous vigil was held on Saturday night for those who died, amid a wider debate about the threat to pedestrians and cyclists posed by ever wider and heavier vehicles on urban streets.\n\nGermany\u2019s love of fast cars runs into the barricades in Berlin Read more\n\nStephan von Dassel, the district mayor of Berlin-Mitte, said \u201carmour-like\u201d 4x4s did not belong in the city, as every driving error put the lives of people at risk. \u201cThese [cars] are also climate killers. They are a threat even without an accident,\u201d he said.\n\nOliver Krischer, a deputy leader of the Green party in the German parliament, called for size restrictions on 4x4s allowed into city centres. \u201cThe best solution would be a nationwide rule that allowed local authorities to set size limits,\u201d Krischer told Der Tagesspiegel newspaper.\n\nWhile the German government is committed to what it calls the Verkehrswende, the green transformation of its transport sector, the number of 4x4s registered on German roads has surged in recent years.\n\nLast month, 4x4s, or SUVs, became the most popular newly registered car type in Germany for the first time, with a market share of 22.2%. More than 1m sports utility vehicles are expected to be registered in Germany by the end of the year, with the average driver aged between 46 and 65.", "description": "Porsche reportedly mounted pavement, killing three adults, including Briton, and child", "authors": ["Philip Oltermann"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf9a6ce9a72d347af1d70e56b2b2aa46f07b9db5/0_80_5003_3001/master/5003.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=af272901bc32b9bc64c028c98ef46000", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
