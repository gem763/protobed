At the current price of $22.75, the stock isn\u2019t the favorite in the sector, but the deal to buy Acreage Holdings (ACRGF) in the future offers a backdoor play into Canopy Growth at a substantial discount to current market prices. The recent inside purchases of the Acreage CEO should highlight the clear path for investors to follow.\n\nAcreage CEO Insider Purchases\n\nIn the last week, Acreage hit new lows in the $6s. Amazingly, the U.S. multi-state operator (MSO) traded at $30 in the last year.\n\nThe cannabis stock is so out of favor that a premium right to purchase on the books from Canopy Growth isn\u2019t helping the stock. For this reason, the open market stock purchases by Chairman and CEO Kevin Murphy are very meaningful.\n\nOn October 8, the CEO bought an additional 100,000 shares at an average price of $6.85 per share for a total purchase price of $685,000. Mr. Murphy has previously bought another 154,000 shares back in July for a total purchase of 254,000 shares.\n\nCanopy Growth Path\n\nThe best part of a long-term investment in Canopy Growth is that the company has the best balance sheet in the business with a cash balance of $2.3 billion. The large Canadian LP can survive any prolonged downturn in the business and would benefit from some reduced competition in the cannabis space.\n\nThe opportunity here is for investors to buy Acreage with a likely path to convert those shares into Canopy Growth shares at a far better price. Once cannabis is federally legal in the U.S., Canopy Growth will close their right to acquire Acreage based on the merger agreement.\n\nThe deal is for Acreage shareholders to obtain 0.5818 shares of Canopy Growth for each share owned. With Canopy Growth trading at $22.75, Acreage would have a conversion value of $13.24 or 95% upside from the current stock price of only $6.80.\n\nIn the meantime, an investor owns a U.S. MSO busy integrating Canopy\u2019s IP, brands, and technologies across their U.S. operations. Despite licenses or consulting contracts for operations in 20 states, the stock has a listed market value of only $800 million while analysts expect the company to top 2020 revenues of $430 million.\n\nThe main reason the stock offers such a large premium on closing of the Acreage deal is that the U.S. MSO stocks have generally become very cheap. Vaping concerns, regulatory approval questions and capital fears have all become drags on the sector still in major growth mode.\n\nConsensus Verdict\n\nOverall, Canopy has had 10 bullish analysts in its corner over the last three months, with 6 analysts playing it safe on the sidelines. The 12-month average price target of $36.36 showcases 76% in upside potential for the stock.
