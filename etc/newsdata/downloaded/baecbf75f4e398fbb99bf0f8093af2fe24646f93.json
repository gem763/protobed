On Saturday, Bride and Prejudice star Codie-Lea responded to her soon-to-be mother-in-law Laurelle calling her a 'plastic c***'\n\nBefore adding: 'It\u2019s degrading. [Laurelle's] never sworn at me ever like that before.'\n\nIn the interview, FIFO worker Nathan, who has his mother's name tattooed on the back of his neck, said he was 'proud' he was able to stay calm and 'not to make things worse' on the memorable day.\n\n'[Our relationship] has been up and down my whole life,' said Nathan, before adding the couple went on the show to repair it for the sake of their child.\n\nIsn't she lovely? '[Our relationship] has been up and down my whole life,' Nathan said of his relationship with mother Laurelle (pictured)\n\nCodie-Lea and Nathan have been together since 2015 and the pair share a two-year-old daughter \u2013 Starr-Armani.\n\nOn Wednesday night's premiere, Laurelle branded Codie-Lea 'a plastic barbie girl'.\n\n'I don't think she's human,' Laurelle added in her introduction.\n\n'She has taken my son and my granddaughter away, and if she was on fire I wouldn't even spit on her... I hate her guts.'\n\nMum's the word: On Wednesday night's Bride and Prejudice episode, Laurelle (pictured) vowed to 'never to accept' Codie-Lea into her life\n\nThe tension between Laurelle and the young couple stems from a feud involving visitation rights with her granddaughter Starr-Armani.\n\n'I don't deserve to have restrictions on my granddaughter,' said Laurelle.\n\n'... [and] I'm not going to bow down to a 20-year-old plastic b***h.'\n\nPlease explain: Codie (pictured) is bamboozled as to why her soon-to-be mother-in-law Laurelle won't accept her\n\nWhen Codie-Lea joined the conversation, the salty-mouthed mother lost it - and fired off a string of foul-mouthed expletives.\n\n'Why is it you will never accept me?' Codie asked stunned.\n\n'Because you're a plastic b***h!' Laurelle spat.\n\n'Everything on you is fake. Fake hair, fake lips, fake boobs, fake eyelashes, fake tan - you're plastic!'\n\nBride And Prejudice continues Tuesday at 7.30pm on Channel Seven", "description": "She was called a 'plastic c***' by her soon-to-be mother-in-law, who added she wouldn't 'spit' on her if she was on fire.", "authors": ["Shannon Shipley For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/05/19323268-0-image-a-41_1570248419134.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
