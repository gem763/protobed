We covered this update in a lot more depth in a separate ZDNet article, in case users want to learn more.\n\nIncognito mode for Google Maps\n\nGoogle first announced incognito mode for Google Maps earlier this year in May, at its Google I/O developer conference.\n\nThe Google Maps incognito mode is modeled after the similarly named feature that's found in all modern browsers and has been present in Chrome since its launch, back in 2008.\n\nIt allows Google Maps users to search and view locations without having this information added to their Google account history.\n\nGoogle says incognito mode for Google Maps will start rolling out on Android this month, with iOS coming soon. The feature is currently not available for the Google Maps web version.\n\nWhen available for their apps, users can turn on incognito mode by selecting it from the menu that appears when they tap their profile photo inside the app.\n\nThe other Google service that supports an incognito mode is YouTube -- since earlier this year.\n\nYouTube history auto-delete\n\nAnd since we're on YouTube, Google is also adding a new feature for it, too. The company said YouTube will get a feature called \"history auto-delete.\"\n\nGoogle previously launched this feature in May, when it added it to Google Search, Google Maps, and Google Account (which allowed users to delete past app usage).\n\nStarting today, the history auto-delete feature is also available for YouTube and will allow users to select an option and automatically delete old YouTube video history once it reaches three or 18 months. You can access this new feature at https://myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols/youtube\n\nImage: Google [supplied]\n\nNew Voice Assistants privacy commands\n\nLast, but not least, Google is also rolling out new privacy features to its voice assistant -- Google Assistant. These updates come after last week the company rolled out changes to its privacy policy on how Google Assistant handles voice recordings in response to concerns related to third-party contractors listening in on users' voice recordings.\n\nBut in the coming weeks, Google users will be able to query the Google Assistant itself about these privacy settings.\n\n\"When you ask questions like 'Hey Google, how do you keep my data safe?' the Assistant will share information about how we keep your data private and secure,\" Google said in a press release shared with ZDNet today.\n\n\"We're also making it easier to control your privacy with simple voice commands,\" Google added. \"In the coming weeks, you'll be able to delete Assistant activity from your Google Account just by saying things like 'Hey Google, delete the last thing I said to you' or 'Hey Google, delete everything I said to you last week.'\n\n\"You won't need to turn on any of these features-they will work automatically when you ask the Assistant for help. If you ask to delete more than a week's worth of data from your account, the Assistant will point you directly to the page in your account settings to complete the deletion,\" Google said.\n\nThese Google Assistant updates will roll out for English-speaking users next week and in all other languages next month.", "description": "Google expands history auto-delete to YouTube, adds better privacy controls to voice assistant.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/07/cb6e5aa4-aae8-475d-ad2c-0594fa2ca15c/thumbnail/770x578/04659057eaa760e6b1f067c77487f59b/maps-incognito.png"}
