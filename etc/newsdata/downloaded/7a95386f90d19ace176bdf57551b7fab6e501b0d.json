The bills are needed to fill in the details of this summer\u2019s budget and debt deal, which reversed cuts scheduled to slash the Pentagon and domestic programs and increased the government\u2019s borrowing cap so it won\u2019t default on its payments and Treasury notes.\n\nSweeping votes on July\u2019s budget blueprint were a kumbaya moment in Trump\u2019s polarized capital. But the Senate Appropriations Committee, tasked with filling in the details, has been beset by infighting in advance of a bill drafting session on Thursday.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

They are also furious about Trump\u2019s moves to raid $3.6 billion in military base construction projects to pay for 11 additional border fence segments totaling 175 miles in Texas, New Mexico and Arizona.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s created a real problem,\u201d said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the most senior member of the Appropriations Committee. \u201cTo take money from substandard schools for children of military people \u2026 that\u2019s left a very bad taste.\u201d\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., is poised with an amendment to an almost $700 billion Pentagon funding bill to block Trump\u2019s unprecedented fiscal maneuvers, and he has several potential GOP allies on the committee.\n\nDurbin\u2019s threat doesn\u2019t seem to have Republicans on edge, but Republicans say that Democrats such as Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., a savvy panel insider, are breaking summertime promises to avoid adding \u201cpoison pills\u201d to the measures that could bog them down or attract Trump veto promises.\n\nIn particular, Murray is pressing to overturn a Trump executive order that takes away federal family planning funds from organizations like Planned Parenthood that counsel women about their abortion options.\n\nThe stakes were raised last month when Planned Parenthood announced it would stop accepting Title X federal family planning funds rather than comply with a Department of Health and Human Services edict to comply with the abortion counseling ban. Two Planned Parenthood clinics in Ohio closed this week.\n\nMurray\u2019s amendment would likely pass the Appropriations panel, where two pro-abortion rights GOP women would likely side with her. Facing that prospect, Shelby dropped the health funding measure from the agenda, along with a foreign aid bill that also faced an abortion controversy.\n\n\u201cHis gag order changed Congress\u2019 intent\u201d to award family planning grants to organizations such as Planned Parenthood, Murray said. \u201cTitle X has had bipartisan support forever.\u201d\n\nThe panel has a long history of smoothing over its differences on abortion in the interest of getting its legislation passed, however, and both sides want to press on and work out the challenges. House members like Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., are eager to start House-Senate conference committee talks aimed at legislation both chambers can pass, as is McConnell.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hopefully going to get past this little rough patch and get back to the agreement we all signed onto,\u201d McConnell said Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get it done because there\u2019s a desire to get it done,\u201d Leahy said. \u201cWe know how to do it.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "A government shutdown remains unlikely, but agencies could face weeks or months on autopilot while frozen at this year's levels.", "authors": ["Andrew Taylor"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/ap19255079287749.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
