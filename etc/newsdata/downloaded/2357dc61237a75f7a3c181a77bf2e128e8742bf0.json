UPDATE 8-Oil rises, supported by U.S. fuel stock draws but weighed by crude build\n\n* U.S. crude stocks rise 9.3 mln bbls in week to Oct. 11\n\n* Refining output declines sharply\n\n* Analysts cite weakened demand as headwind for oil bulls\n\n\n\n(Updates with settlement prices, adds commentary)\n\nBy Stephanie Kelly\n\nNEW YORK, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose about 1% on\n\nThursday after draws in U.S. fuel inventories, but gains were\n\ncapped by a larger-than-expected rise in crude stockpiles and a\n\nseries of weak economic figures.\n\nGlobal benchmark Brent crude rose 49 cents, or 0.8%,\n\nto settle at $59.91 a barrel. U.S. WTI crude gained 57\n\ncents, or 1.1%, to settle at $53.93 a barrel.\n\nU.S. gasoline stocks USOILG=ECI fell by 2.6 million\n\nbarrels in the week to Oct. 11, while distillate stockpiles\n\nUSOILD=ECI , which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 3.8\n\nmillion barrels, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said\n\non Thursday. But a soaring rise in crude inventories offset the draws.\n\nCrude stocks rose by 9.3 million barrels, far surpassing\n\nestimates for a build of 2.8 million barrels.\n\nThe rise was the result of a reduction in refining output\n\nfor the week to its lowest capacity use nationwide since\n\nHurricane Harvey in September 2017. Refining capacity use fell\n\nto 83.1% as refiners shut in capacity across the country.\n\n\"This is generally a bullish report,\" said Phil Flynn,\n\nsenior energy analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. \"Part\n\nof the problem for the build is that refineries are not running.\n\nRefinery runs fell down, which is a concern.\"\n\nOverall imports have fallen, in part due to sanctions\n\nimposed on Chinese shipping firm COSCO that have raised freight\n\ncosts.\n\nThe United States imposed sanctions on COSCO Shipping Tanker\n\n(Dalian) Co and subsidiary COSCO Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Seaman\n\n& Ship Management Co for allegedly carrying Iranian\n\noil. Adding to concerns about the global economy, and therefore\n\nenergy demand, U.S. retail sales fell for the first time in\n\nseven months, while housing starts and industrial output dropped\n\nas well. Earlier data showed a moderation in job growth and\n\nservices sector activity. \"If we see more indications of slowing demand, I think the\n\nmarket is going to continue to sink lower,\" said Gene McGillian,\n\nvice president of market research at Tradition Energy in\n\nStamford, Connecticut.\n\nBrexit developments gave oil prices some support. European\n\nUnion leaders gave their unanimous backing to a Brexit deal with\n\nBritain on Thursday, putting the onus on Prime Minister Boris\n\nJohnson to secure the British parliament's approval for the deal\n\nin a vote in two days. Analysts have said any agreement that avoids a no-deal\n\nBrexit should boost economic growth and oil demand.\n\n\n\n", "description": "UPDATE 8-Oil rises, supported by U.S. fuel stock draws but weighed by crude build", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA6204A_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
