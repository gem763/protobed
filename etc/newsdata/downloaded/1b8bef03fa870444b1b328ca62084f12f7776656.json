We didn\u2019t need very much help.\u201d\n\nBoth the tone and substance of Trump\u2019s comments about the Kurds are in question now. The Kurds have suggested they played a much bigger role than Trump indicated, and U.S. officials have acknowledged the instrumentality of the information provided by the Kurdish-led Syrian Defense Forces.\n\nAD\n\nThe SDF\u2019s effort to join in the credit began even before Trump\u2019s news conference Sunday, when the SDF commander, Gen. Mazloum Kobane Abdi, described the Baghdadi raid as the fruit of a months-long \u201cjoint intel cooperation.\u201d It was understood at the time that the Kurds had provided at least some intelligence that had allowed for locating Baghdadi in northwest Syria.\n\nAD\n\nFor five months there has been joint intel cooperation on the ground and accurate monitoring, until we achieved a joint operation to kill Abu Bakir al-Bagdadi.\n\n\n\nThanks to everybody who participate in this great mission.@realDonaldTrump#SDF#USArmy #Rojava #Baghdadi \u2014 Mazloum Abd\u00ee \u0645\u0638\u0644\u0648\u0645 \u0639\u0628\u062f\u064a (@MazloumAbdi) October 27, 2019\n\nJust how vital that information was, we didn\u2019t know. But in postmortems of the raid, both The Washington Post and the New York Times describe the information as being vital. Both reported that an ISIS militant became an informant for the Kurds.\n\nAD\n\nThe disaffected ISIS member had become an informant for Kurdish forces working with the Americans, the official said. And he provided critical information on Baghdadi\u2019s whereabouts. The informant emerged in early summer, and over time U.S. officials became more confident in his credibility and reliability, the official said. Within the past couple of weeks, it became clear that, when put together with other information, the tip about Baghdadi\u2019s location was solid, the official said. \u201cIt was a montage of a lot of pieces of intelligence that came together with a specific asset that was helpful,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe Times also reported that the information was central to the effort but that it was hardly the only piece of information from the Kurds \u2014 even after Trump\u2019s withdrawal from northern Syria that left the Kurds so vulnerable:\n\nArmed with that initial tip, the C.I.A. worked closely with Iraqi and Kurdish intelligence officials in Iraq and Syria to identify more precisely Mr. al-Baghdadi\u2019s whereabouts and to put spies in place to monitor his periodic movements. American officials said the Kurds continued to provide information to the C.I.A. on Mr. al-Baghdadi\u2019s location even after Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw the American troops left the Syrian Kurds to confront a Turkish offensive alone. The Syrian and Iraqi Kurds, one official said, provided more intelligence for the raid than any single country.\n\n\u201cMore intelligence for the raid than any single country\u201d sure seems like a far cry from Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cwe had our own intel\u201d and that \u201cwe got very little help.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s version was further contradicted Monday by an interview Mazloum gave to Fox News\u2019s Benjamin Hall. In the interview, Mazloum said the SDF provided Baghdadi\u2019s location, details of his compound, where the tunnels were and how many people were there.\n\nAD\n\nKurdish Gen Mazloum tells .@BenjaminHallFNC: The SDF provided the location, the details about the Baghdadi compound, the tunnels, and how many people were with him. The SDF knew this because of a source inside ISIS.\n\nAn SDF member was on the raid helping US. \u2014 Jennifer Griffin (@JenGriffinFNC) October 28, 2019\n\nMazloum also told NBC that the informant provided critical logistical details and other evidence, including Baghdadi\u2019s dirty underwear and a sample of blood for use in DNA analysis.\n\nAD\n\nMazloum and the Kurds certainly have motivation to play up their assistance as much as possible right now, given that the United States is at a crossroads when it comes to the alliance. Trump has spoken dismissively about the Kurds for weeks and suggested the United States doesn\u2019t really have a dog in the fight in their long-running tensions with Turkey (though he has recently decided the United States would stay in Syria to defend oil fields that are important to the SDF\u2019s financial stability).\n\nBut Trump\u2019s version of events as almost impossible to reconcile with what we\u2019re hearing about what the Kurds did.\n\nAt best, Trump seems to be oversensitive to the idea that he has abandoned the Kurds and that his withdrawal was a bad idea. Perhaps he\u2019s downplaying the role the Kurds played here because he knows that hailing their support would only make his alleged abandonment of them look worse.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt worst, though, he feels no real loyalty to them and that this is truly just a relationship of convenience \u2014 perhaps because he was persuaded to be skeptical of the Kurds by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nEither way, it seems a particularly harsh stance after the Kurds played a significant if not major role in what Trump has contended was a bigger capture than Osama bin Laden.\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nAD", "description": "The Kurds reportedly assisted on the mission in several ways, even after Trump's withdrawal left them vulnerable.
