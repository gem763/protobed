But because it requires unanimous support, any one senator can also block their requests.\n\nElection security has become a point of contention during the Trump era. House Democrats have passed several election-related bills, including a sweeping ethics and election reform measure, but they've hit a wall in the GOP-controlled Senate.\n\nWarner, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, tried to pass legislation that would require campaign officials to report contacts with foreign nationals who are trying to make donations or coordinate with the campaign to the Federal Election Commission, which would notify the FBI.\n\n\u201cThe alarm bells are going off and what are we doing? We\u2019re running out of time to do something about it,\" Warner said from the Senate floor.\n\nWarner added that if a foreign government offers to interfere to help a campaign \"the appropriate response is not to say thank you.
