Once he\u2019s all done, the work will remain there permanently.\n\nJoe was told to stop doodling in class (Picture: CATERS NEWS AGENCY)\n\nDad Greg said: \u2018Joe is a really talented little boy, he\u2019s excelling at school, he\u2019s a great footballer and cricketer, but drawing is definitely what he is most passionate about.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s actually quite annoying, he\u2019s better than me at most things.\n\n\u2018He was in school getting frustrated at the little amount of art he could do so he used to doodle on the table\u2019s whiteboard in class and get into trouble for doodling\n\n\u2018His mum and I decided to get him into an art class outside of school called Bloom, he\u2019s been there for about six weeks and he loves every minute of it.\n\n\u2018His drawings blew his teacher away and they gave him his own wall to keep doodling on which he does every week when he goes there.\n\n\u2018A few weeks into his classes, his teacher asked if she could post his work on her Instagram for everyone to see and a short while later we got another call from her about a restaurant who had seen his work.\n\nHe now spends hours doodling on the wall of the dining room (Picture: Caters News Agency)\n\n\u2018They wanted to get Joe into their restaurant to complete an art piece on their wall, and it was in their main dining area, we were over the moon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I asked Joe and he of course leapt at the chance to do it so we have been going there after school where for a couple of hours a night he\u2019ll put his creativity on their wall.\n\n\u2018Joe loves doodling and we\u2019re so proud of everything he\u2019s achieving, the fact that a completely independent business has asked our nine-year old son to do a professional piece of work for them is incredible.\u2019\n\nGreg posted Joe\u2019s work on LinkedIn, where it quickly racked up more than 1,500,000 views and comments.\n\nHis art teacher said she recognised Joe\u2019s skills right away.\n\n\u2018I first met Joe several weeks ago, he was a bit frustrated at school because he couldn\u2019t doodle as much as he wanted to and had been asked to stop,\u2019 said Kerry.\n\n\u2018I asked his parents for some of his work to assess his level and could not believe what I was looking at, we moved him into an older class straight away.\n\n\u2018His work is very exact and immaculate, it\u2019s very balanced, he goes straight to ink and creates perfect work straight from the start, no practising beforehand.\u2019\n\nCan he decorate our offices next?\n\nMORE: Narcissists are less likely to experience stress and depression, suggests new research\n\nMORE: The 4 best facials in London to avoid the curse of winter skin\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Joe Whale, nine, kept getting into trouble for doodling during classtime.
