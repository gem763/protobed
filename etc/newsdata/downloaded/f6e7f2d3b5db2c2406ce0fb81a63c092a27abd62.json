Or even like an ex-Beatle under a steamroller \u2013 Biden is the Pete Best of American politics, the guy who never quite made it. Except Pete Best wasn\u2019t a gropey, senile, corrupt Democrat plagiarist with delusions of adequacy.\n\nAnd every day, [Pick A Nickname] Joe is getting worse.\n\nNow, Joe used to have this kind of goofy charm. He was and remains a doofus, but a harmless one, sort of like that dorky neighbor who makes circus music play in your head every time he wanders over to your yard to tell you a long and ultimately pointless story about how he saw a squirrel and the squirrel had a nut and it was a fuzzy squirrel and it lived in a tree and how he likes squirrels.\n\nBut his regular guy act is wearing a bit thin. His appeal used to be that of someone who liked Budweiser and talking about sports and who did not give off the kind of smarmy condescension vibe to normal people who work for a living that is now so typical of blue state libs. You were talking about the old Joe when you talked about old school Dems, the party of the workin\u2019 man instead of the party of the illegal alien, government drone and bitter SJW. These salt-of-the-earth folks were the very people that Trump \u2013 who spent his whole career working with union guys to build stuff instead of bloviating for a living like the New Class elites are wont to do \u2013 appealed to and stole right out from under the Democrat coalition. Not that many Democrats minded losing the white working class \u2013 Felonia Milhous von Pantsuit famously wrote off people who sweat when they work, probably because of all that unjust privilege held by guys who drive Mac trucks or fix toilets.\n\nJoe\u2019s big sell is that he could get these Normals back in the fold, and that was a threat for a while, except Joe has not only dived way left with his party but the scrutiny he has invited has changed the Biden narrative, and not for the better.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing \u2013 you are not going to win back hardworking middle-class voters by promising to pay for the medical care of illegal aliens who shouldn\u2019t even be here in the first place. And it\u2019s pretty hard to trash the current medical system when it\u2019s the system you and your boss Barack Obama forced us all into in the first place. Getting huffy when you get asked how many genders there are and then get a follow-up of \u201cSo, what\u2019s number three?\u201d does not help you appeal to real people either.\n\nBut everyone goes left in a Dem primary, and Joe would no doubt try to pivot back in the general. He might be able to pull off his centrist scam again after the convention, and if that was his only problem, he might have a decent shot.\n\nBut it\u2019s not his only problem. He\u2019s got a whole bunch of problems and Trump will mercilessly twist the knife in every one of them.\n\nLet\u2019s start with his family. His relatives were apparently brazenly peddling Joe\u2019s influence to the Chi-coms and the Ukrainians and probably others. While that won\u2019t upset the mainstream media \u2013 it only cares about fake TRUMP RUSSIA TREASON baloney when it comes to foreign influence peddling \u2013 normal people will find that disturbing. And the mainstream media can no longer treat such stories the way the big Indian (no relation to Elizabeth Warren) treated Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest because we now have alternative media to get out the word on this sordid corruption.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not even get into his son Cokie\u2019s bizarre lifestyle. \u201cWell, Mr. Vice President, the good news is your son is no longer married to your other son\u2019s widow. The bad news is he left her to marry someone else then knocked up yet another woman.\u201d\n\nEven putting aside his disturbing skinny-dipping fetish, there\u2019s the gal-groping. He seems to be trying really hard not to get handsy with the local talent, but you know he\u2019s going to slip up. He can\u2019t help it. He\u2019s not a mere hugger. He\u2019s gross, and that\u2019s already defining him.\n\nNow, maybe you can survive some tarnishes on the old image. Hell, people still voted for the Clintons again and again. But it\u2019s hard to survive being defined as an incoherent bull-Schiff-er.\n\nJoe is the Gaffe-O-Matic, with a new embarrassment every day exuding from his ever-open piehole. One day he\u2019s standing in New Hampshire extolling the virtues of Keene, Vermont. The next day he\u2019s creating his own ever-morphing Sarajevo sniper story about pinning a medal on a corporal, or was it a Navy captain? There\u2019s a significant difference, in that the corporal actually works for a living. And a \u201cyoung\u201d Navy captain? Let me assure you that no O6 in any branch qualifies as \u201cyoung.\u201d\n\nAnd it just goes on and on. Joe was always a clown, a joke, the politician other pols sent to pick someone up from the airport. If he was a member of the Corleone family, he\u2019d be Chris.\n\nBut now this ancient, crusty nimrod wants to have his finger on the button. At 76 today, he\u2019s just not all there, and he was never much there to begin with. His handlers will rightly worry that when he wanders down to the Oval Office in the morning he\u2019ll be in a loose, flapping bathrobe because he forgot to change out of his pajamas. Assuming he was even sleeping in PJs and not going commando. It\u2019s not like the Oval Office hasn\u2019t been the scene of cringey antics before. Four years of this guy? He can\u2019t handle four minutes onstage without embarrassing himself.\n\nJoe desperately needs an intervention, but he won\u2019t get one. We normal people think he\u2019s a Dumb Man Walking, and the polls indicate way too many Democrats think he\u2019s the cream of their commie candidate crop, the one with the best chance to take on Trump. So, he\u2019ll keep mortgaging his dignity until he either wins the nomination or the Democrats decide to go all-in on the Stalinist, or the Squaw, or the Furry, or Stevie Nicks 2.0, or one of the other members of their primary freak show\u2019s cast.\n\nRight now, Trump\u2019s gotta be rolling with laughter.\n\nOh well. It couldn\u2019t happen to a nicer party.\n\nIf you want to read a vivid account of what happens if the Democrats succeed and establish a one-party dictatorship a la California and Venezuela in the scat-saturated ruins of the blue states, check out my action-packed yet hilarious novels, People's Republic, Indian Country and Wildfire. The Never Trump losers hate my books and call them \u201cappalling,\u201d which is the highest possible praise.", "description": "Joe Biden leads the Democrat pack and he\u2019s a catastrophe, .09/02/2019 3:12:05AM EST.", "authors": ["Kurt", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/210/7f8f9639-d43c-4352-a1a5-ad523f521470.png"}
