REUTERS/David Gray/File Photo\n\nMELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia\u2019s antitrust regulator has hurt competition, not helped it, by blocking a A$15 billion ($10 billion) merger between the third- and fourth-largest telecoms providers, a lawyer for one of the companies told a court on Tuesday.\n\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) opposed a tie-up between TPG Telecom Ltd and the local joint venture of Britain\u2019s Vodafone Group PLC in May on grounds that it would discourage both from competing in each other\u2019s markets.\n\nVodafone mainly runs a mobile phone business in a joint venture with Hutchison Telecommunications (Australia) Ltd while TPG has a low-cost internet business.\n\n\u201cThe notion that TPG would, if the merger\u2019s blocked, roll out a mobile network is just not of the real commercial world,\u201d said Vodafone lawyer Peter Brereton in his opening statement at a Federal court hearing.\n\nBrereton said it would be \u201ccommercially crazy\u201d for TPG to build its own mobile network to rival Vodafone\u2019s, and \u201cthat, in particular, is where the ACCC\u2019s case descends into speculation and possibilities.\u201d\n\nThe deal would actually encourage competition but \u201cthe pro-competitive effects of this merger are imperiled by the ACCC\u2019s opposition to it\u201d, he said.\n\nTPG abandoned building its mobile telephone network which relied on equipment from Huawei Technologies Co Ltd after the Chinese firm was banned by Australia on security grounds last year.\n\nBut the regulator had said TPG may revisit the plan and that rivalry in the industry depended on it.", "description": "Australia's antitrust regulator has hurt competition, not helped it, by blocking a A$15 billion ($10 billion) merger between the third- and fourth-largest telecoms providers, a lawyer for one of the companies told a court on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Sonali Paul", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428148545&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8902U", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
