His powerful storytelling on both television and digital platforms has elevated our entire news gathering process.'\n\n'It will be interesting to find out whether these are journalists who tell the truth or whether these are opinion makers who are essentially coddling the president as allies,' Carl Cameron said Friday, calling Smith's departure a 'big loss' for the network.\n\n'It says something about the way in which the cable channel has been for years shrinking the news department and building its right-wing entertainment hosts, because that gets ratings and ratings gets revenue and that's how they make money,' Cameron said.\n\n'It's a real sad day for people who watch Fox News and want accurate information because Shep was somebody you could reliably count on.\n\n'The American people need to hear that so they can make good judgments Otherwise it's just propaganda, and that's the stuff of third-world nations, not the one that prides itself as leader of all nations.'\n\nFormer Fox News reporter Carl Cameron told MSNBC that 'it will be telling' to see who steps into Smith's slot\n\nJust two weeks ago a war of words erupted after Tucker Carlson mocked colleague Smith over comments about President Trump and his Ukraine call.\n\nCarlson targeted Smith during his show after the latter had defended a Fox News analyst earlier in the day. The ongoing saga was ignited when Smith had Fox News contributor and former judge Andrew Napolitano on his show to talk about the Trump-Ukraine call.\n\nJudge Napolitano told Smith that it would constitute a crime if Trump had asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate presidential candidate Joe Biden to uncover dirt on him.\n\nSmith said diGenova was a 'partisan guest' and that his comments went unchallenged by prime time host Carlson.\n\n'Attacking our colleague who's here to offer legal assessments on our air in our work home is repugnant,' Smith told his viewers.\n\nIn response, Carlson invited diGenova back on his show Wednesday night to mock Smith.\n\n'Apparently our daytime host who hosted Judge Napolitano was watching last night and was outraged by what you said and, quite ironically, called you partisan,' Carlson said.\n\nLast year, Smith was chastised by colleague Laura Ingraham on Twitter after Smith said Fox News opinion programs on his networks doesn't 'really have rules' and exists 'strictly to be entertaining'.\n\nTo that Ingraham said: 'Always liked Shep, but his comments were inconsiderate & inaccurate. The hard working team at the Ingraham Angle does real reporting, develops impt sources and scores big interviews. Very proud of them.'\n\nFellow host Sean Hannity said at the time: 'While Shep is a friend with political views I do not share, and great at breaking news, he is clueless about what we do every day.'\n\nHowever after news of Smith's departure broke, several Fox News hosts and contributors offered their well wishes to their former colleague, including Hannity who wrote: 'I've always said there is nobody better at breaking news than Shep Smith.\n\n'He has always done great things and I know he will continue to do so. Looking forward to seeing Shep crush it in whatever he does next.'\n\nLaura Ingraham ridiculed Trump as 'inconsiderate and inaccurate' last year for calling opinion programs on the network 'strictly entertainment'\n\nThe sudden move comes after the anchor was both praised and derided over the past three years for his criticism of President Trump\n\nSeveral Fox News hosts and contributors offered their well wishes to their former colleague, including Sean Hannity who wrote: 'I've always said there is nobody better at breaking news than Shep Smith'\n\nBret Baier said it was a 'total shock' to learn of Smith's departure from Fox News after more than two decades with the network\n\nGeraldo River said on Twittter: 'Goodbye @ShepNewsTeam Shep, you're a great newsman and you'll be missed. Safe travels Matey, fair winds and a following sea.'\n\nWhile Bret Baier wrote: 'It was a total shock today to find out he's leaving. He anchored breaking news -fast-moving events \u2014better than anyone. I wish him well in whatever lies ahead.'\n\nSources said that Smith was escorted out after his final appearance, and a Fox News spokesperson later told DailyMail.com that it was in fact Smith's own security detail who walked him out on Friday.\n\nHe was brought in to audition after Roger Ailes saw his coverage for Fox affiliates during the OJ trial (above in 1996)\n\n'Shep's exit from the building was planned and executed by Shep with Fox's complete approval and the full support of FOX News \u2013 he was not remotely escorted out,' they said.\n\nHis partner Giovanni Graziano, who was a production assistant on Smith's show for just over a year before moving over to Varney & Co. on the Fox Business Network in 2012, also deleted his Linked In profile.\n\n'Recently I asked the company to allow me to leave FOX News and begin a new chapter. After requesting that I stay, they graciously obliged,' said Smith.\n\n'The opportunities afforded this guy from small town Mississippi have been many. It's been an honor and a privilege to report the news each day to our loyal audience in context and with perspective, without fear or favor.'\n\nHe continued: 'I've worked with the most talented, dedicated and focused professionals I know and I'm proud to have anchored their work each day \u2014 I will deeply miss them.'\n\nSmith also made it clear that he will be off the air for at least some time.\n\n'Under our agreement I won't be reporting elsewhere, at least in the near future, but I will be able to see more of [my partner] Gio and [our dog] Lucia and our friends and family and then we will see what comes along,' said Smith.\n\n'This is my last newscast here. Thank you for watching today and over the decades.'\n\nHe then closed out his final newscast by stating: 'It's been an honor and my pleasure.'\n\nPartner: Smith, 55, said that he was looking forward to spending more time with his partner Giovanni Graziano, 31, and their dog Lucia (Smith and Gio in 2015)\n\nThe news came as a big surprise to Neil Cavuto, who follows Smith in the 4pm hour.\n\nHis face appeared visibly shocked at the start of his show as he remarked on what a important part of the Fox News team Smith had been for the past three decades.\n\nPRES. TRUMP ON SMITH'S EXIT MARTOSKO: Did you or your administration pressure Fox News to get rid of Shepard Smith? TRUMP: No, I don't know. Is he leaving? MARTOSKO: He's leaving. TRUMP: Oh, that's a shame. MARTOSKO: Then why did Bill Barr meet with Rupert Murdoch the other night? TRUMP: That I don't know. Wait, did I hear Shepard Smith is leaving? MARTOSKO: Yes. TRUMP: Is he leaving because of bad ratings? Tell me. I don't know. He had terrible ratings. Is he leaving because of his ratings? I mean, if he's leaving I assume he's leaving because he had bad ratings. MARTOSKO: You didn't put any pressure on anybody? TRUMP: He had the worst ratings on Fox. So there's a reason. Why is Shepard Smith leaving? MARTOSKO: You'd have to ask him, Mr. President. TRUMP: Well I wish him well. I wish Shepard Smith well.\n\n'Whoa,' said Cavuto. 'Like you, I'm a little stunned.'\n\nSmith, who left University of Mississippi two credits shy of a degree to take his first job, got his start on Fox News after catching the eye of Roger Ailes.\n\nHe has said in the past that Ailes saw him reporting on the OJ Simpson trial for Fox affiliates and then called him asking if he would fly to New York City to talk more about the possible new position.\n\nSoon after, Smith moved to New York City and began his career at the network.\n\nIn the past few years he has come under fire while at the same time being praised for his coverage of President Donald Trump.\n\nIt all kicked off in 2016 when he said that Trump 'trades in racism' during the primary, and Smith has remained one of the network's few critics of the president ever since.\n\nComments like those are why President Trump never appeared on Smith's show, despite the anchor reaching out to his campaign for an interview.\n\n'I would like to have some time with him,' said Smith back in 2016.\n\n'For me, at least, it would be interesting to go through the things he's said and the things he's done and try to get an explanation.'\n\nWhen asked about Smith's departure on Friday by DailyMail.com, President Trump said: 'Is he leaving because of bad ratings? Is he leaving because of me?'\n\nSmith also came out as gay in recent years, giving a rare glimpse into his private life during an interview with Time.\n\nIn that story Smith, 55, acknowledged his relationship with 31-year-old Giovanni Graziano.\n\n'I have a longtime boyfriend and we're as happy as we can be,' revealed Smith.\n\n'We live a very normal life and go to dinner and go to games and see his family and see my family.'\n\nHe then added: 'It's great for us, but I can't imagine anyone else finding it interesting.'", "description": "Sources say Shepard Smith was sick of being publicly attacked by his primetime colleagues Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham.", "authors": ["Kayla Brantley", "Chris Spargo", "David Martosko", "U.S Political Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/15/19627580-0-image-a-14_1570889834734.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
