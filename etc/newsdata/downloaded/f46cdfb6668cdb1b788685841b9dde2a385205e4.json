They call Karoui, 56, a flamboyant tycoon who wears designer suits, \u201cMichael Corleone\u201d, a reference both to his suaveness and the corruption allegations that have dogged him for years.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A supporter of the then jailed Tunisian presidential candidate Nabil Karoui shows his portrait during a gathering in Tunis in September.

His relative lack of charisma may be playing to his advantage, according to analysts, who say his appeal rests on the idea that he is incorruptible and sternly civic-minded.\n\nHe argues for scrapping the country\u2019s parliamentary system in favour of a decentralised democratic model and is socially conservative, declaring his support for the death penalty and against a law currently under discussion that would distribute inheritances equally between men and women. He has spoken disparagingly of homosexuality and says he would seek to limit the work of foreign NGOs in the country.\n\nKaroui was arrested on corruption charges on the eve of campaigning earlier this year in timing that many saw as a ploy to stem his popularity but which appeared to have backfired, enshrining his status as an outsider. He remains under investigation and cannot travel abroad.\n\nBut if he wins the runoff, Karoui would \u201creceive immunity \u2026 and all the legal proceedings against him \u2026 will be suspended until the end of his mandate\u201d, the constitutional law professor Salsabil Klibi told Agence France-Presse.\n\nTunisia has brushed close to chaos in the years since its revolution, as Islamist and secularist forces fought for control of the country. Its transition appeared most risky in 2013 after several leftist leaders were assassinated, allegedly by Islamic extremists, deepening the polarisation between the country\u2019s political factions.\n\nYet it pulled back, largely due to the efforts of civil society groups (who were awarded the 2015 Nobel peace prize) and political elders who struck an improbable power-sharing agreement in 2016. The agreement has brought stability but also stalled reforms that might have helped to curb corruption or slim down the country\u2019s bloated and sclerotic bureaucracy.\n\nSaied is considered the favourite and has the backing of the Islamist Ennahda party, which won the largest share of parliament though fell far short of claiming a majority. Presidential power is also limited, and the significant reforms Saied advocates would require a two-thirds majority in parliament that will be difficult to build, said Masri.\n\n\u201cHe is going to be an isolated leader because he does not have a political party,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a chance he could be an irrelevant president.\u201d\n\nExit polls will be known by Sunday evening and a final result is likely to be declared within days.", "description": "Election is choice between two outsiders, a low-profile professor and a recently imprisoned magnate", "authors": ["Michael Safi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff44f875f940f021cdcb6b300cb06c9a3770c442/0_0_3304_1983/master/3304.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=063e4f0bd88e20cc2af83fb6118fdfbe", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
