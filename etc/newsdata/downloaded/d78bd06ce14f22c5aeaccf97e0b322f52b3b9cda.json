Yes, like any player, when we do this job we want to touch the very high level.\n\n\"But the very high level I can touch with Nice from the moment we give ourselves the means to succeed and from the moment the way which we work is quite consistent.\n\n\"But we do this job, and I do this job, to one day to be the coach of a team that participates in the Champions League.\u201d\n\n(Image: Reuters)\n\nArsenal's title-winning team of 2003/2004 - starring Gunners legends such as Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp and Vieira - went down in history as 'The Invincibles' after going the whole season without losing a game.\n\nAnd former Gunners boss Arsene Wenger recently hailed that squad as the greatest one he ever managed.\n\n\"You would say the Invincibles \u2013 it\u2019s an easy question to answer,\" Wenger said when asked which title-winning side was the best, in quotes reported by Metro .\n\n\"My dream was always to play a season without losing a game so I cannot go against that. But as well I must say I inherited a team of men when I came to Arsenal \u2013 this was the team that won in 98. Adams, [Steve] Bould, Winterburn, Keown, [Lee] Dixon - that was the core of the team.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\"It was branded Arsenal players who were ready to die for the club. You could go after the game in the fight in the corridors you would know they would not leave you alone \u2013 this was the type of players I had at the start.\n\n\"They were ready to go to war with you, you could be in the trenches with them.\n\n\"Afterwards the second generation of players who had as well exceptional charisma. We speak a lot about the first generation but the other defence of Lauren, Campbell, Toure and Ashley Cole were exceptional with Lehmann in goal- they were characters.\n\n\"At the end of the day when you look back you feel when you get that right \u2013 the personalities \u2013 you are ready to go anywhere in the world. These teams had charisma.\"", "description": "Vieira won three Premier League titles with Arsenal \u2014 including in 2003-04 when he captained the \u2018Invincibles\u2019 team", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Afp Getty Images", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14446096.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FBL-FRA-LIGUE1-LILLE-NICE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
