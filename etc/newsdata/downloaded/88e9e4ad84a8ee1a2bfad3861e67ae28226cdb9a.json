On a global scale, we have never before created such a magnificent bubble. These central bankers are clueless, and they have proven that beyond a doubt. All they can do is to try to keep the bubble going.\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s Michael Pento of Pento Portfolio Strategies giving his timely Halloween-week assessment of the current climate in an interview on USAWatchdog.com.\n\nAt this point, if the Federal Reserve stops juicing the economy, Pento argues, we could be looking at another depression.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why the Fed\u2019s panicking,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anybody still believes they\u2019re omniscient or omnipotent or know their butt from their elbow, that\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to lower its benchmark interest rate this week by 25 basis points, the third such cut in three months. According to the minutes from the Sept. 17-18 meeting, \u201cdownside risks had become more pronounced since July,\u201d yet \u201cseveral participants\u201d wanted the Fed to provide more clarity on when the response to those risks, including \u201ctrade uncertainty,\u201d would end.\n\nPento, whose holdings lean heavily on Treasurys TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.19% and gold GC00, -0.10% , expects the interest-rate cuts to keep coming in the face of record household and corporate debt.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s QE. It\u2019s QE on steroids,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody knows that this QE is permanent just like any banana republic would do, or has done.\u201d\n\nWith all the imbalances in the system, Pento says the Fed is well aware the next recession won\u2019t be a mild one, so it keeps pumping to avoid that fate.\n\n\u201cThe plunge in the stock market would be huge and from a much higher level,\u201d he said. \u201cBack in the Great Recession, unemployment claims spiked. We had millions of people laid off, and the same thing would happen today only... much worse.\u201d\n\nWatch the full interview:\n\nNo sign of a plunge on Monday, with the Dow DJIA, +0.49% , S&P SPX, +0.56% and Nasdaq COMP, +1.01% all moving higher midday.", "description": "Michael Pento of Pento Portfolio Strategies gves us his timely Halloween-week assessment of the current climate.", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU136_depres_MG_20191028120830.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
