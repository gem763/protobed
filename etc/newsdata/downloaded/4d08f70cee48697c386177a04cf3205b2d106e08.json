Bradley Byrne (R-AL) joined Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM, where he discussed the entering of the secret, closed-door impeachment inquiry room and the Democrats\u2019 latest impeachment efforts against President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cWe said in the press conference that we should not be kept out of that room, that we demand to be allowed in the room to hear the testimony, to see the witnesses,\u201d Byrne told Breitbart News Washington Political Editor Matt Boyle. \u201cThey sent their staff out to say we can\u2019t let you in and I said, \u2018who said?\u2019 and they said the Democratic majority staff.\u201d\n\nByrne made it clear that the individual who told Republican members of Congress that they were not permitted to come in the room had no authority to keep them out. Afterward, Byrne said he and his colleagues also walked into the room.\n\n\u201cWe walked into a room we should\u2019ve been in in the first place,\u201d Byrne added.\n\n\u201cPart of this got started with this whistleblower complaint and now they\u2019re saying no, the whistleblower is no longer important,\u201d Byrne said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of like saying Mueller is no longer important. They grab onto something, they think it\u2019s their thing, they hype it up, and then they have this sham that they\u2019re doing right here.\u201d\n\nByrne also said he has yet to see transcripts relating to the depositions.\n\n\u201cI, as a member of Congress, have not seen one word of these transcripts of these depositions,\u201d Byrne stated. \u201cSo all the leaks are going to the news media. They\u2019re not going to members of Congress. It\u2019s a total sham.\u201d\n\nByrne also discussed his interaction with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA).\n\n\u201cWe went in the room. We all lined the walls, nobody said anything because we knew we weren\u2019t there to be able to ask questions and the room was quiet,\u201d Byrne said. \u201cAdam Schiff looked dumbfounded and he started talking quietly, whispering to the staff that was there with him and then he got up to walk out of the room.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs he got up, he had to walk past me and I said, \u2018Adam don\u2019t leave,\u2019 Byrne said. \u201cHe just kind of looked at me, glared at me and then walked out of the room. Didn\u2019t say a word and never returned to the room. So the rest of the time we were in there, we tried to engage with the remaining Democrats in the room.\u201d\n\nByrne also made it clear that some of the Democrats behind the closed doors were willing to talk with Republicans who were curious why the testimony was not taking place in public.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to get this out in the open,\u201d Byrne said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we did what we did.\u201d", "description": "Rep.
