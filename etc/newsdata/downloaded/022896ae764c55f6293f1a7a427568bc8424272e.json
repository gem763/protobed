Anti-Semitic comments suggested that he was blackmailed by the ADL \u2014 a Jewish anti-hate group \u2014 in order to be in good standing again on YouTube and in the media. On Wednesday, Kjellberg posted a statement on Twitter in light of the conspiracies, saying he\u2019s making the donation to \u201cmove past\u201d his controversies.\n\nKjellberg has oftentimes been steeped in controversy for using racist language or anti-Semitic imagery in his videos. After paying two men on Fiverr to hold up a sign that said \u201cdeath to all Jews\u201d in 2017, Disney severed ties with him. ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt congratulated Disney for its move soon after the decision was made.\n\n\u201cADL commends Disney\u2019s decision to sever ties with PewDiePie following his posting of videos on YouTube containing swastikas and other anti-Semitic content,\u201d Greenblatt said in a statement at the time. \u201cThis clearly crosses a line, but is becoming all-too commonplace on social media.\u201d\n\nAn ADL spokesperson told The Verge that they learned about the \u201cpotential donation when everyone else did: when he made the announcement on his channel yesterday.\u201d There hasn\u2019t been any further communication between the two.\n\nKjellberg\u2019s relationship with YouTube has become more amicable in recent weeks\n\nEarlier this year, Kjellberg and his followers, in an effort to keep his channel the most-subscribed one on YouTube, created the \u201cSubscribe to Pewdiepie\u201d meme. For weeks, the phrase was plastered across social media, and although it started out harmless, it quickly picked up a lot of negative attention from racist trolls on the internet. At the height of the meme, a shooter in Christchurch, New Zealand said the phrase before murdering 51 people in mosques. It was shortly after that event that Kjellberg asked his subscribers to end the meme.\n\nKjellberg\u2019s decision to support the ADL with this donation marks one of his first public moves take responsibility as a hugely popular and influential creator. For years, Kjellberg and YouTube\u2019s relationship has been rocky. But soon after he became the first independent creator to reach 100 million subscribers on the platform, the two became more amicable, with YouTube sending him a new Play Button trophy and congratulating him for his success on Twitter.\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s video in which Kjellberg first announces his donation, he does not address any controversies specifically, but says, \u201cI made a lot of mistakes on the way, but I\u2019ve grown.\u201d He continued, \u201cI feel like I have at least. I feel like I\u2019ve finally come to terms with the responsibility I have as a creator \u2014 about 100 million subs too late, but you know.\u201d\n\nUpdated 9/11/19 at 4:06 p.m.: Updated to include a statement from the ADL.", "description": "Throughout his career on YouTube, support for Felix \"PewDiePie\" Kjellberg has come in waves.
