McSwain said in court filings. \u201cWhen they realized that a FSA-ID had already been created for Donald Trump, they attempted to obtain access to the existing account by answering the security questions associated with the account. They did a search in Google for answers to the security questions and then used Trump\u2019s Social Security number to attempt to get the tax records.\u201d\n\nIRS records suggest four unsuccessful attempts were made to access Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns through the FAFSA website, according to prosecutors, who said that the co-defendants carried out the scheme using the computer lab credentials of other Haverford students.\n\nBoth men were charged in July with two counts each of computer hacking; accessing, and aiding and abetting the accessing of a computer without authorization to obtain information from a protected computer; and attempting to access a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access to obtain information from any department of the United States.\n\nMr. Hiemstra entered a similar guilty plea last month, and both men are scheduled to be sentenced Dec. 16. They face maximum sentences of two years imprisonment followed by one year of supervised release, in addition to fines of up to $200,000 each.\n\nWilliam Brennan, an attorney for Mr. Harris, told The Washington Times that his client takes the case very seriously and bears no ill will toward Mr. Trump or his family.\n\n\u201cHaving said that, it\u2019s important to put this case in perspective,\u201d Mr. Brennan told The Times. \u201cThis is not, as some professor has publicly opined, \u2018akin to Russian hacking.\u2019 It\u2019s a college prank gone awry. Mr. Harris was expelled from school and charged, by the government, with federal criminal offenses. It is my cautiously optimistic hope that the court will credit Mr. Harris\u2018 acceptance of responsibility and guilty plea when imposing sentence.\u201d\n\nThe co-defendants carried out the scheme on Nov. 2, 2016, less than a week before Mr. Trump was elected president over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump was the first major presidential candidate in decades to refuse to release his tax returns, and he has continued while in the White House to keep his returns under wrap.\n\n\u201cNo matter what you think about the president\u2019s tax returns, clearly this kind of illegal activity cannot be tolerated or condoned,\u201d Mr. McSwain said. \u201cUnauthorized or false attempts to obtain any citizen\u2019s IRS filings are a serious violation of privacy rights and a federal crime, and there\u2019s nothing funny about it. Now this un-funny plot has branded both Harris and his cohort, Hiemstra, with federal criminal convictions that they deserve.\u201d\n\nMr. Harris was expelled from Haverford in October 2017, according to court documents. Mr. Hiemstra, a Fulbright Scholar, finished his studies but will not graduate until completing a study-abroad program next year, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
