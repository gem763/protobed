Its outlook remains stable.\n\n\"The downgrade reflects rising geopolitical and military tensions in the Gulf region, Fitch's revised assessment of the vulnerability of Saudi Arabia's economic infrastructure and continued deterioration in Saudi Arabia's fiscal and external balance sheets,\" Fitch said in a release.\n\nThe downgrade comes roughly two weeks after the heart of the kingdom's oil infrastructure was hit by a drone and cruise missile attack that Riyadh and Washington have blamed on Iran.\n\nRiyadh was quick to rebuke the agency's move. \"The Ministry of Finance is disappointed that Fitch took a swift decision to downgrade the Kingdom,\" read a statement issued by Saudi Arabia's finance ministry within a few hours of Fitch's announcement. \"Rather, the event highlights Saudi Arabia's outstanding capacity to effectively deal with adversities, commitment to maintaining stability in the global oil markets, and the Kingdom's status as an important international ally,\" it said.\n\n\"As such, the downgrade of the rating comes across as somewhat speculative without direct reference to the swift, decisive and effective response to the event,\" the ministry added.", "description": "Saudi Arabia's strong credit rating has been taken down a notch thanks to geopolitical risks two weeks after major attacks on its oil infrastructure.", "authors": ["Natasha Turak"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106132459-1568663188635gettyimages-1168377310.jpeg?v=1568694177", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
