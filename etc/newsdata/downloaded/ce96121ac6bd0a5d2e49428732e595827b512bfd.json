Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Friday became the first 2020 presidential candidate to explicitly say Congress should begin impeachment proceedings against President Trump, citing Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s findings.\n\n\u201cThe Mueller report lays out facts showing that a hostile foreign government attacked our 2016 election to help Donald Trump and Donald Trump welcomed that help,\u201d Warren tweeted on Friday afternoon. \u201cOnce elected, Donald Trump obstructed the investigation into that attack.\u201d\n\nShe then cited text from the special counsel\u2019s redacted report, released Thursday: \u201cCongress has authority to prohibit a President\u2019s corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe correct process for exercising that authority is impeachment,\u201d the senator declared.\n\n\u201cThe severity of [Trump\u2019s] misconduct demands that elected officials in both parties set aside political considerations and do their constitutional duty,\u201d the Massachusetts Democrat concluded. \u201cThat means the House should initiate impeachment proceedings against the President of the United States.\u201d\n\nMost recently, Warren said she wanted to wait until the Mueller report was released before making a conclusion on impeachment\u2014a line that many 2020 Democrats have taken thus far. Now she is one of two who definitively said that the contents of the report warrant the initiation of impeachment proceedings.\n\nOther competitors in the primary field have been more cautious in recent days deferring to Congress on the matter, though in an interview with CNN on Friday, Juli\u00e1n Castro was more direct saying that it would be \"perfectly reasonable\" for the House to begin impeachment proceedings. Castro's campaign characterized it as him being first to the punch on the issue.\n\n\u201cI think that Congress needs to make that decision,\u201d South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg said at an event on Friday. \u201cI think he may well deserve it, but my focus, since I\u2019m not a part of Congress but I am part of 2020, is to give him a decisive defeat at the ballot box, if he is the Republican nominee in 2020.\u201d\n\nSen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) told MSNBC that she wouldn\u2019t rule it out but would like to hear testimony from Mueller.\n\n\u201cI think that there is definitely a conversation to be had on that subject, but first I want to hear from Bob Mueller,\u201d Harris told MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes in an interview on Thursday, \u201cand really understand what exactly is the evidence that supports the summary that we have been given today.\u201d\n\nOthers, like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), have only said that Congress should continue investigating the president.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that Donald Trump wanted nothing more than to shut down the Mueller investigation,\u201d he said on Thursday following the report\u2019s release. \u201cWhile we have more detail from today\u2019s report than before, Congress must continue its investigation into Trump\u2019s conduct and any foreign attempts to influence our election. We must also work to do everything we can to protect our future elections from the significant threat of foreign interference, and I call on President Trump and Republican leadership to stop obstructing the necessary work to protect our democracy.\u201d", "description": "The Massachusetts senator is the first 2020 candidate to explicitly say Congress should begin impeachment of Trump.", "authors": ["Gideon Resnick", "Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1958,w_3482,x_125,y_257/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1555704973/RTS2GG68_dgmohn", "published_at": "2019-04-19"}
