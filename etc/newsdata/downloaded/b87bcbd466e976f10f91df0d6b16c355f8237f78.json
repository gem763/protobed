Her landlord and landlady are asking her to leave the apartment she has lived in for five years so they can rent part of the property on Airbnb.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re an elderly couple and they stay in the apartment above me for a month or two each summer,\u201d she explains. \u201cThey told me they want my apartment back because they are struggling with the stairs. But when I suggested I move upstairs instead, they said their son wants to turn it into an Airbnb.\u201d\n\nTwo-bed apartments like Nolan\u2019s in her area of Paros average about 80 euros a night, versus Nolan\u2019s 100-euro per month rent. That makes earning potential for landlords much higher, especially throughout the high season of June, July and August. This income disparity is one of the reasons that, although Nolan\u2019s contract doesn\u2019t end until next April, they are taking her to court to force her out earlier.\n\nShe is struggling to find a new home. Nelson lives across the road from her daughter, Katerina Bamboulis, and sees her every day. However, if she can no longer afford the cost of living, she says she may need to return to the UK for better work opportunities, and leave these close ties behind.\n\nHousing challenges like these are becoming increasingly common in places where tourism is thriving: the number of short-term rentals is eclipsing the number of places where locals can live.", "description": "The places where Greek locals can call home are changing \u2013 and, in some cases, disappearing \u2013 as short-term holiday rentals cannibalise long-term housing arrangements.", "authors": ["Jessica Bateman"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7l/p3/p07lp3kr.jpg"}
