Photo: HBO\n\nIf there\u2019s an evil opposite of a Mona Lisa smile, it\u2019s the expression on the face of Logan Roy (Brian Cox) at the end of Succession\u2019s second season, as he sits in front of a television watching his son, Kendall (Jeremy Strong), address reporters at a devastating press conference that builds to Kendall declaring of his father, \u201cThis is the day his reign ends.\u201d Viewers will spend the downtime between now and season three parsing Logan\u2019s expression for clues on how he\u2019ll deal with Kendall, whether he\u2019ll manage to stay in control of the company that he founded and whether this was a case of a minion turning on his boss or another one of Logan\u2019s chessmaster schemes, wherein Kendall becomes the instrument of his old man\u2019s destruction because Logan doesn\u2019t want to do the deed himself. We Zapruder the close-up and wonder: Is Kendall suddenly turning on his dad a wild card that Logan didn\u2019t anticipate, or has Logan outthought and outplayed his son yet again? Was choosing his son and right-hand man as a \u201cblood sacrifice\u201d an act of corporate and emotional filicide? Or was it a roundabout way of firing himself, as suggested earlier in the finale, when a powerful board member frankly told Logan that he had to step down?\n\nOf course, this kind of thing is fun to talk about. But it\u2019s just as satisfying to think about what Logan\u2019s expression means in terms of the emotional dynamics of the Roy clan, all of whom avoid talking about trauma and seem incapable of feeling or expressing love in anything like a healthy way. And it\u2019s here that King Lear, an often-cited comparison point, comes into the picture. While the show\u2019s mile-a-minute plotting and razor-blade insults mark it as a comedy \u2014 like Arrested Development, Veep, and Seinfeld, its characters tend to be ruthlessly self-interested and unconcerned with whether anybody likes them \u2014 the dramatic aspect comes from its unflinching depiction of a family whose capacity to feel love, empathy, and compassion has been worn down to a nub by decades of a greedy and manipulative patriarch\u2019s abuse. In King Lear, the patriarch promises to give the kingdom to whichever of his three children offers the most effusive declaration of love for him, and is shocked to his core when his kindest and most honest child, his daughter Cordelia, refuses. But there is no Cordelia Roy in sight here. There\u2019s only a matched set of four vipers, a snake-king father, and a constellation of terrified underlings and lesser predators waiting on scraps in the pit.\n\nBy the time Jesse Armstrong\u2019s HBO saga gets to that close-up of Logan, he\u2019s in danger of being ousted by Waystar Royco shareholders because its cruise-ship division covered up years of exploitation, abuse, and possibly murder of sex workers and migrant workers. (The crimes in question were callously filed away as NPRIs, or No Real Person Involved.) Following a grueling family summit on a gigantic black yacht that looks as if it could have been made by the intergalactic shipyard that manufactured the Imperial Fleet in Star Wars, Logan chose Kendall to fall on his sword to save the company, but the son turned on the father instead, publicly declaring him a vile and treacherous person and effectively declaring war on him. The instant the episode ended, viewers began debating what Logan\u2019s cryptic attentiveness meant. He didn\u2019t stomp and roar and shout \u201cFuck off\u201d at the TV. He watched and listened, even shushing his family when they tried to pipe up while Kendall was speaking \u2014 a sharp contrast to an earlier episode where the family gathered to watch an expos\u00e9 of the company\u2019s cruise-ship malfeasance and cracked jokes all the way through.\n\nMy record of guessing what\u2019s going to happen next on a TV show is not much better than anyone else\u2019s. But I don\u2019t think Succession is a four-dimensional-chess kind of show, where there are machinations inside of machinations inside of machinations, and I don\u2019t think a character like Logan Roy, a very blunt and impatient person who always wants to get on with it and move along, would set up Kendall to take him out in such a twisty-turny way. There are too many things that could go wrong with a plan like that, and besides, Logan already talked to his inner circle \u2014 including his three other children, Shiv (Sarah Snook), Roman (Kieran Culkin), and Connor (Alan Ruck) \u2014 about the possibility of stepping down himself. The whole point of raising that possibility was to have everyone assure Logan that he should stay in charge, because that\u2019s what every move he makes is about. (The way he poses the question at breakfast on the yacht is very Lear-like, made comic by that cut to Roman rolling his eyes.)\n\nNo, I think if we look at the situation straightforwardly, take all of the characters at face value, and consider what we already know about them, this is what happened: Logan spent every moment since Kendall\u2019s Chappaquiddick-like accident grinding his son down, making him so subservient that he would gladly fall on a grenade should the need arise, but when Logan finally reached a point where he had to play his son like an ace card, the card didn\u2019t want to be played. I think Kendall went onto that helicopter expecting to immolate himself, but somewhere between the deck of the yacht and the press conference, he realized that he had a chance to finally, successfully commit virtual regicide and patricide \u2014 something he tried and failed to do in season one. It seems he even enlisted Greg, who saved some of the incriminating cruise-division documents that Tom wanted destroyed; the cutaway to Greg at the press conference tells us they\u2019re in cahoots and confirms the kid was never as dumb as he looked.\n\nIf Logan had a master plan, using Kendall as a human shield was probably it. It was a good plan, Logan spent a long time laying the groundwork for it \u2014 even insisting that Kendall accompany him to the home of the dead waiter\u2019s family, something that absolutely did not have to happen \u2014 and it came out of who these characters are and what they\u2019ve been through. Succession is built around fear and awe of a withholding and volatile father, from the opening-credits sequence in which the father\u2019s face is cropped out by the frame line, blurred, made indistinct by distance as he walks away, to the way he insists on making others come to him or arrives late to meetings he himself convened. (In the season finale, Logan joins the Survivor-like gathering that\u2019s already in progress, descending via helicopter from the sky like a god about to render judgment on mortals.) Like a lot of rich and fearsome patriarchs, Logan does what he wants and cannot conceive of not being in charge of everything, and he tends to make a big show of asking for advice and then doing whatever he\u2019d planned on doing in the first place. The only exceptions are when another character gives him a bit of battlefield intelligence that could prevent him from losing money, power, or both, as when Roman comes back from his harrowing trip to Turkey and announces, with evident disappointment and bracing honesty, that the deal they hoped to engineer to take the company private was likely doomed.\n\nWhat we\u2019re seeing here is a father sending his pathetic lapdog son \u2014 a son he\u2019s broken and humiliated since childhood \u2014 to be the \u201cblood sacrifice\u201d that keeps him in power, then realizing that the kid had more guts than he thought and now poses a formidable threat to him. In their last conversation before Kendall\u2019s trip back to the mainland, Kendall looks like a beaten and terrified little boy with a dutifully inclined head and wet eyes. But abuse survivors will recognize that is not just the face of a depressed, traumatized person. It\u2019s the face of a character who is harboring a tremendous, possibly lethal anger against his father, and who finally got a chance to unleash it. Some people who experience agony at the hands of an abusive parent never fight back, or get the opportunity to do so. Kendall, who already came at the king and missed, has a chance to actually do the deed.\n\nBut in a twisted, very Roy-family way, this is also an expression of love, or at least their version of love. Logan sees his children as extensions of himself, and the only demonstrations of familial intent that stir him are displays of nerve or force. Kendall\u2019s turn demonstrated both. Respect is Logan\u2019s equivalent of love. \u201cHe loves me, I think he does,\u201d Kendall says in this very episode. \u201cI just think it\u2019s the wrong kind of love expression.\u201d When Kendall described his father as a vile and treacherous man in front of the world and swore to take him down, it was the purest expression of his need for love, and the bond he has with his father, that we\u2019ve seen thus far on Succession. Only by killing his father can the son earn his father\u2019s love.", "description": "In a twisted, very Roy family way, Succession\u2019s season season finale is the purest expression of Kendall\u2019s need for Logan\u2019s love.
