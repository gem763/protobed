There's no rule of law anymore. We can only be united and protest.\"\n\nWhat began as opposition to a proposed extradition law, which could have seen people sent for trial in mainland courts, has grown into a broad pro-democracy movement and a serious challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\nRead more: Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announces a ban on anything that covers a person's face as violence in the city's protests intensifies\n\nThe protesters are angry about what they see as creeping interference by Beijing in their city's affairs. China dismisses accusations it is meddling and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of stirring up anti-China sentiment.\n\nMany protesters wear masks to hide their identity due to fears employers could face pressure to take action against them as companies walk a tightrope between the anti-government activists and the city's political masters in Beijing.\n\n\"Almost all protesters wear masks, with the intention of hiding their identity. That's why they have become more unbridled,\" said Lam.\n\n\"We can't keep the existing regulations idle and let violence escalate and the situation continue to deteriorate.\"\n\nLam described the territory as being in serious danger, but not in a state of emergency.\n\nPro-Beijing groups had been pushing for a mask ban, but it was not clear how the government would implement it in a city where many of its 7.4 million residents wear them every day to protect against infection following the outbreak of the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003.\n\nProtester are seen walking through tear gas smoke in Hong Kong on August 4, 2019, Vernon Yuen/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nSomething drastic\n\nAuthorities had already loosened guidelines on the use of force by police, according to documents seen by Reuters.\n\nThat came just before an escalation in violence on Tuesday, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, when police fired about 1,800 volleys of tear gas, 900 rubber bullets and six live bullets - one of which hit an 18-year-old, the first time a protester had been hit be live fire.\n\nThe student, Tony Tsang, was shot at close range as he fought with a policeman. He is stable in hospital and has been charged with rioting, which carries a maximum 10-year sentence, and assaulting an officer.\n\nPro-democracy campaigners condemned Lam's latest decision.\n\n\"This is an ancient, colonial set of regulations, and you don't use them unless you can't legislate anymore,\" said Martin Lee, a veteran activist and one of the city's most prominent lawyers. \"Once you start, there's no end to it.\"\n\nSome Hong Kong's businesses, struggling with a dip in tourism and retail sales due to the protests, gave the law a warmer welcome.\n\n\"I agree with it at this point,\" said businessman Allan Zeman, who is also an economic adviser to Lam. \"You have to do something drastic to end the violence.\"", "description": "Hong Kong police shot and wounded a teenage boy on Friday after embattled leader Carrie Lam announced a ban on face masks under the emergency laws.", "authors": ["Clare Jim", "Poppy Mcpherson"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8634282e22af062f23b5c2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
