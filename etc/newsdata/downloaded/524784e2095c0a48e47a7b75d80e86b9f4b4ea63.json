On two occasions, they needed a dramatic, eighth-inning rally to tie or take the lead in a win-or-go-home game. Both times \u2014 the wild-card game against the Milwaukee Brewers and Game 5 of the National League Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers \u2014 came down to an offense sputtering to life after faltering for most of the game. They\u2019d scored just one run until those eighth innings, something that sounds familiar.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis star-studded pitching matchup between two of the game\u2019s top pitchers, Stephen Strasburg and Justin Verlander, won\u2019t matter if the Nationals struggle to score. They scored one run in each of their three home games and, even though An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez, Patrick Corbin and Joe Ross delivered outings that teammates felt kept them in the game, the bats never gave the team a legitimate chance to win.\n\nManager Dave Martinez seemed frustrated by the offense, not because they weren\u2019t having good at-bats, but because he felt like they were. The Nationals hit rockets around the park but, more often than not, right at people. Shortstop Trea Turner expressed confidence that, sooner rather than later, those balls would fall for hits. They\u2019ll need to in Game 6 because, to win this series, they\u2019ll need to make history. No team has ever won a World Series with four road victories.\n\nReliever Sean Doolittle, as always, kept the faith. He ended a lengthy explanation of why the team couldn\u2019t deliver at home with a note of hope that the team could make it up to the fans.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHopefully we can take care of business in Houston and come back and party with \u2019em.\u201d\n\nLineups\n\nWashington Nationals\n\nTrea Turner SS\n\nAdam Eaton RF\n\nAnthony Rendon 3B\n\nJuan Soto LF\n\nHowie Kendrick DH\n\nAsdr\u00fabal Cabrera 2B\n\nRyan Zimmerman 1B\n\nVictor Robles CF\n\nYan Gomes C\n\nStephen Strasburg P\n\nHouston Astros\n\nGeorge Springer CF\n\nJos\u00e9 Altuve 2B\n\nMichael Brantley LF\n\nAlex Bregman 3B\n\nYuli Gurriel 1B\n\nYordan Alvarez DH\n\nCarlos Correa SS\n\nRobinson Chirinos C\n\nJosh Reddick RF\n\nJustin Verlander P\n\nPregame reading\n\nThe story of these Nationals has never been easy to believe, so why stop believing now?
