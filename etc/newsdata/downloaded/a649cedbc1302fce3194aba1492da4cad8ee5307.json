The timeframe is definitely wrong, as WaPo reports, though the recent realities of drug pricing are more nuanced.\n\nPrices for generics are falling, which brings down the average cost of drugs overall. Prices for commonly used drugs, including generics, fell in 2018, according to a White House report.\n\nreport. But that average masks steady increases in the price of drugs that treat rarer diseases, which don't have generic competition.\n\nBrand-name drugs' prices increased by only 0.3% in 2018, per IQVIA, although per-capita spending on specialty drugs increased by 5.8%.\n\nOn defense \u2014 attacking Democrats over \"Medicare for All\" \u2014 Trump is also making some dubious claims.\n\n\"Almost every major Democrat in Washington has backed a massive government healthcare takeover that would totally obliterate Medicare.... They want to raid Medicare to fund a thing called socialism,\" he said last week.\n\nhe said last week. Sen. Bernie Sanders' \"Medicare for All\" bill would indeed replace traditional Medicare, but seniors' healthcare benefits would get more generous under that plan, as written \u2014 not less. However, critics of the plan say it would likely reduce seniors' access to care.\n\nAnd though it's true that Sanders' bill would eliminate private health insurance, other plans would retain it as an option.\n\nThe other side: \"Democrats, apparently unsatisfied with lying about healthcare once when they introduced Obamacare, have now introduced sweeping proposals, such as Medicare for All. These radical and dangerous policies would take away the insurance Americans know and trust while raising taxes and reducing choice,\" White House spokesman Judd Deere said.\n\nYes, but: There's still a lot of time left before 2020, particularly for Trump to do something major on drug prices.", "description": "President Trump has made murky and false claims about his health plans, including protecting those with pre-existing conditions.", "authors": ["Caitlin Owens"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da08dfdcc4a0a1ee8748996?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
