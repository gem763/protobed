China has allowed the yuan (CNY) to weaken further beyond 7 per dollar to help offset new tariffs imposed by the United States.\n\n\" continues to watch CNY movements and broader dollar bias, which at this juncture points toward further INR weakness owing to a weak global environment,\" noted Radhika Rao, economist at DBS in Singapore.\n\nSlowing growth concerns pushed central banks across a group of 37 developing economies to deliver a net fourteen interest rate cuts last month - the largest since the financial crisis.\n\nOf those, the Reserve Bank of India was one of the most aggressive. It has lowered interest rates several times this year and is expected to do so again.\n\nHowever, over 75% of strategists in response to a separate question said expected RBI rate cuts would have no impact on the rupee or be negative. The remainder said easing would benefit the currency.\n\n\"Even after the 110 (basis points of) cuts, the impact on the rupee was felt more recently when a number of other factors emerged, including the slowdown in both domestic and global demand,\" said Kunal Kundu, India economist at Societe Generale (PA: ), the most accurate forecaster for Asian currencies in 2018.\n\n\"That is why interest rates as a stand-alone factor will only have a marginal effect on the rupee.\"\n\n(Polling by Anisha Sheth and Shaloo Shrivastava; Editing by Kim Coghill)", "description": "Indian rupee unlikely to gain traction as investors stay shy: Reuters poll", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF84087_L.jpg"}
