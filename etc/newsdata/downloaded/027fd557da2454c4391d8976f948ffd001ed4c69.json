It doesn\u2019t make the work better or worse.\u201d\n\nDonnelly, better known as Kaws, is sitting in the office above his Brooklyn studio, surrounded by the collectible characters that have made him a pop culture phenomenon.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of him, you have probably seen his work: with 2.4 million fans on Instagram, a huge following in Asia, a coveted line of vinyl toys, and collaborations with brands as varied as Dior, Nike, Sesame Street and Uniqlo, Kaws has become one of the most popular living artists in the world. But that also makes him one of the most contentious.\n\nThe headlines he refers to happened only recently: in March this year, his 2005 painting the Kaws Album was sold for a shocking $14.8m.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Kaws Album (2005) sold for $14.8m at auction in March. Photograph: Kaws\n\nIt was a secondary market sale, which Donnelly had no control over, didn\u2019t profit from, and is clearly sick of talking about. Just a week earlier, he had launched one of his most ambitious sculptures on Hong Kong\u2019s Victoria Harbour: a 30-metre inflatable Companion \u2013 one of the iconic characters of the Kaws kingdom \u2013 which dwarfed the boats around it as it floated past the city skyline.\n\nThe project had left him \u201con a high\u201d, he said \u2013 but then the sale at Sotheby\u2019s happened, \u201cand immediately every headline shifted to the money\u201d.\n\nThe painting itself is one sq metre, based on the Yellow Album: the Simpsons\u2019 appropriation of the album cover for the Beatles\u2019 Sgt Pepper\u2019s. On top of the faces of the cartoon characters, Donnelly had painted Kaws\u2019 signature ears and crossed-out eyes.\n\nThe sale price smashed the auction house\u2019s estimates 15 times over. As one critic noted, the piece was worth $2m more than Propped by Jenny Saville, which had made her the most expensive living female artist ever when it went under the hammer a few months earlier. Hers was a groundbreaking commentary on feminism and the male gaze; his was a riff on a riff, and seemed more like a cheeky joke.\n\nSuddenly, critics were assessing the conceptual value of the art, and the artist was drawn into a conversation he\u2019d rather not be having. \u201cDo I think my work should sell for this much? No,\u201d Donnelly posted flatly on Instagram that day. \u201cDid I arrive at my studio this morning the same time I always do? Yes.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Donnelly poses amid his private collection \u2013 and his own creations. Photograph: Angus Mordant/The Guardian\n\nThe Kaws hype \u2013 and backlash \u2013 didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. Justin Bieber, Pharrell Williams, DJ Khaled and Larry Warsh are among his collectors, and in the years leading up to the sale, his toys were being snapped up in frenzies and copied by fakes, and his Uniqlo collaborations were bringing all-out brawls to stores.\n\nArtNet reported that \u201call 20 of Kaws\u2019s highest auction prices were set in 2018\u201d, but quoted art adviser Josh Baer, who dismissed the craze as a bubble: \u201cIf you think that Paris Hilton and the Kardashians are important cultural figures, then you\u2019re likely to think Kaws is an important artist.\u201d\n\nBut art institutions are now paying attention. Kaws: Companionship in the Age of Loneliness opened on Thursday at the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne: the largest retrospective of Kaws\u2019 25-year career to date. Another exhibition, Blackout, opens in London in October; and in 2021, the Brooklyn Museum will host its own major survey.\n\nThe Melbourne show features more than 100 works including Donnelly\u2019s early sketches, tags and street art; sneaker collaborations; toys; abstract paintings; and large-scale sculptures. The gift shop has been over-run by collectors for the last two days, and the NGV commissioned its own work, too: the largest bronze Kaws piece ever, Gone stands at seven metres tall and weighs 14 tonnes.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Commissioned by the NGV, Gone is the artist\u2019s largest ever bronze sculpture.

In the early 90s, through skating, he found a community among the street artists of New York \u2013 mostly older men who mentored him, names like Futura, Zephyr and Lee Quinones.\n\nAfter a degree in illustration, he was breaking into advertising cabinets throughout the city, taking Calvin Klein, Marlboro and Guess posters back home, painting over them and then returning them to the streets. It wasn\u2019t political, or anticapitalist, he says. He doesn\u2019t like to talk about motivations. \u201cIt was a proof of existence thing. I liked the [advertising] images. I painted over them because they were omnipresent.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018It was a proof of existence thing\u2019: Early in his career, Kaws took ad posters from the New York streets, worked on them at home, and then returned them. Photograph: Tom Ross\n\nThe ad interventions are showcased at the NGV, as are the artist\u2019s takes on cartoon characters, from Spongebob to Snoopy to the Simpsons \u2013 and including, of course, the Kaws Album. But most impressive are his more recent paintings: striking, vibrant and playful abstractions, with block colours so vivid and intense you want to reach into them. To get that effect takes anywhere between 30-60 layers of paint.\n\nNGV contemporary art curator Simon Maidment believes Kaws\u2019 work has been unfairly dismissed by some critics, who have varyingly described it as \u201cconceptual bankruptcy\u201d and \u201cpointless promotional toy garbage\u201d.\n\n\u201cI see Brian, through his work, as a great kind of humanist, who is engaging on quite an emotional level with people,\u201d Maidment says. He feels \u201cpathos\u201d, \u201cdespair\u201d and \u201cconsolation\u201d in Kaws\u2019 sculptures, which are categorised as Companions, Accomplices, Chums or BFFs. These are the heroes of the exhibition, and when they appear together they hold or carry one another. When Companions appear alone, they mostly appear despondent, dejected or mortified.\n\n\u201cThe figures are often talked about as cartoon or fun or whatever \u2026 but I think he\u2019s responding very clearly to the rise of loneliness in our society.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Engaging on an emotional level with people... an installation view of the Kaws exhibition. Photograph: Tom Ross\n\nLoneliness is a topical theme, and now a global concern, but the sculptures that best represent it make up only part of the show; the majority is dedicated to Kaws\u2019 pop culture riffs and collectibles. When the New York Times spoke to Brooklyn Museum director Anne Pasternak about the artist\u2019s 2021 survey, she admitted: \u201cI didn\u2019t see the appeal [of Kaws] initially,\u201d explaining that art with too much mass appeal \u201cmakes the art world uncomfortable\u201d.\n\nMaidment is invigorated by these debates. \u201cAre these significant works in the world or not? Yes, they are for some people, and no they\u2019re not for others \u2013 but that\u2019s the case for all art,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there seems to be something in particular about Brian\u2019s work \u2013 I think because it has attracted such extreme sale values \u2013 which has created a sense of hostility. People want each individual work to live up to a level of significance that they don\u2019t feel is matched by that about of money.\u201d\n\nOn the secondary market itself, he says: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a clear relationship between the cultural significance of a work and the monetary value ascribed to it. If there was, there would be a lot more women selling for a lot more money.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kaws: Holiday, an installation in Fujinomiya, Japan in July 2018. Photograph: Handout/AllRightsReserved via Getty Images\n\nKaws has now produced more than 130 varieties of toys, sold in limited \u2013 and unlimited \u2013 editions for fans and private collectors. Visiting Japan in the late 90s, he was inspired by the otaku subculture and its obsessions with characters and collectibles. Soon, he had fallen in with high profile Japanese streetwear designers, and in 2006, Kaws launched his own fashion label and shop, Original Fake, in Aoyama.\n\nHis commitment to merchandise and \u201cproduct\u201d may be a turn-off for the high art world, but being accessible, he says, is part of the point. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a kid, you look at galleries as these zones that are like, \u2018stay out\u2019 and \u2018you\u2019re not welcome\u2019 or \u2018you\u2019re priced out\u2019. Through product, you get to become familiar [with the art] in a very personal way, in your own home \u2026 It gives you confidence to go to see other works, to learn more.\u201d\n\nHe calls activist Keith Haring a \u201cpivotal influence\u201d \u2013 another New York street artist who opened his own shop, the Pop Shop, selling work cheaply as a means of democratising it.\n\n\u201cKeith was like a bridge to me,\u201d Donnelly says. \u201cWhen I was younger, I wasn\u2019t going to galleries, I wasn\u2019t going to museums \u2026 There was a lot of \u2018this is fine art\u2019 or \u2018this is not fine art\u2019; \u2018this is commercial\u2019, \u2018this is high art\u2019. In my mind I thought, art\u2019s purpose is to communicate and reach people. Whichever outlet that\u2019s being done through is the right one.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Kaws: Companionship in the Age of Loneliness is open at the NGV, Melbourne until 13 April 2020; Kaws: Blackout opens at London\u2019s Skarstedt gallery on 1 October; a major Kaws survey is planned for Brooklyn Museum in 2021.
