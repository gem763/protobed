If you watch the best teams they take more risks with the ball, they make more runs in behind and that\u2019s part of the process for the boys.\n\n\u201cWhen they\u2019re losing confidence maybe they want to play it a bit more safe but it\u2019s not safety that does it here - at this club you do take risks.\u201d\n\nSolskjaer attributes much of United\u2019s struggles to injuries, with Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial missing a large part of the season already. David de Gea is likely to miss Sunday\u2019s game after picking up a groin injury on international duty.\n\n\u201cOf course when you lose the majority of your front creativity that we started with you're going to struggle to create as many chances as you like,\u201d Solskjaer said.\n\n\u201cAt Newcastle we had 75 per cent possession but you can't carve that opening. The pressing up high has been very good, the attitude and desire in that respect, but not enough chances created, chances haven't been taken.\n\n\u201cSometimes that's confidence, that's human nature. You see players missing chances they normally won't miss but it's up to us to keep working and get the ball between the posts. That goal never moves, that's the easiest bit. You know where it is.\u201d", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has insisted that the Manchester United manager\u2019s job is not too big for him despite overseeing the club\u2019s worst start to a season in 30 years.
