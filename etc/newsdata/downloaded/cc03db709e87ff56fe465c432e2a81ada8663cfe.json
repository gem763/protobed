I think rugby is probably ... right up there in terms of integrity, respect and how they treat people,\" he said. \"But I think it's important to never just assume that it's always going to be that way.\"\n\nThe 24-year-old said he was aware of fellow professionals and players at grassroots level being subjected to racist abuse.\n\nItoje called on athletes who have been subjected to racist abuse to speak out and said there should be stricter punishment for offenders.\n\n\"It's a shame because (soccer) is such a beautiful game and it's being tarred by people with racist thoughts and racist minds,\" he said. \"It's terrible that players have to experience that when they just want to go out and play the game they love.\n\n\"Associations and teams need to take a tougher stand. Punishment needs to be more severe because it is not acting as a deterrent, especially when they go abroad to places like Bulgaria.\"\n\nEngland play Australia in the quarterfinals of the Rugby World Cup on Saturday.\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "Rugby cannot afford to be complacent about racism in the wake of the abuse suffered by England's black soccer players in their Euro 2020 qualifier in Bulgaria, lock Maro Itoje has said.
