SamMobile reports that the update is rolling out in certain regions right now for the Galaxy S10, S10 Plus, and S10E, and includes support for DeX PC connectivity, Live Focus blur effects in video recordings, and other camera features. It also includes this month\u2019s Android security patch.\n\nSamsung later confirmed the rollout had begun in Europe, and issued a second press release on October 1st adding that they\u2019d also come to the UK.\n\nSamsung revamped its DeX concept with the Note 10, letting you access your phone\u2019s apps from any computer rather than requiring a separate monitor setup. Perhaps unsurprisingly, we found that it\u2019s still a pretty inelegant solution, as these things tend to be. But edge-case functionality stands a better chance of working for anyone when it isn\u2019t locked to a single device, so there may well be Galaxy S10 users out there who\u2019ll find a use for this.\n\nThe over-the-air update had reportedly started rolling out first in Germany and Switzerland, suggesting it may only be ready for the Exynos processor-powered variants of the S10 phones. Models released in the US and certain other regions use Qualcomm Snapdragon processors and have already received a security patch this month, so the features update may be a little way off.\n\nUpdate, October 1st at 1:43PM ET: Added that the UK is now getting the update.", "description": "A new Galaxy S10 software update is bringing headline features from the Note 10 to Samsung\u2019s other flagship phone line.
