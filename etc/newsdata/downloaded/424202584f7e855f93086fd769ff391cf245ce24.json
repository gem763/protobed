being question by border police he was taken away to a police station where he was questioned for another eight hours in a special interrogation chair that restricted his hands and feet.\n\n\u201cI asked for a lawyer but they said no. Even [when] I wanted to call my family, they said no,\u201d he says.\n\nWong\u2019s case is an extreme but increasingly phenomenon for residents of Hong Kong, a former British colony, as they attempt to cross the border in recent weeks.\n\nWhile the Asian financial city returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, it was promised a special semi-autonomous status for 50 years and for now maintains a British-style legal system under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d agreement.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Lam Cheuk-ting, Democratic Party legislator\n\nCheng\u2019s case is even more concerning as he was detained at a train station on Hong Kong soil, according to Hong Kong Free Press.\n\nThe new express rail link sees passengers go through Chinese customs on the Hong Kong end of the station, meaning mainland law applies once they pass the checkpoint.\n\nThe immigration arrangement was controversial when it first announced and fears appear to be coming true, according to Jason Y Ng, convenor of the Progressive Lawyers Group in Hong Kong, with searches and detention now commonplace.\n\n\u201cThe British consulate staffer was a prime example of the danger and his case has made the danger real,\u201d says Ng.\n\nHe says the group was afraid of \u201cinvasion of privacy, denial of entry, possible arrest on the mainland, and installation of Trojan Horse apps\u201d on residents\u2019 phones which can relay information back to security services long after the interrogation is over.\n\nDemocratic Party legislator Lam Cheuk-ting, who was contacted to help with Wong\u2019s case by his family and girlfriend, says he had personally been messaged about half a dozen cases of border detentions by concerned family and friends.\n\nOther legislators have also been contacted as well, he says, but suspected there were many more cases of residents who had chosen to remain silent.\n\n\"For most of them the reason for their detention is the mainland [immigration] officers found some photos or footage of the protests of Hong Kong on their mobile phone,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAfter the [recent] movement started, it has become very common. They check the mobile phones of the youngsters who wear black T-shirts to everyone [else],\n\n\u201cIt has become common knowledge that you don\u2019t bring your mobile phone to mainland China.\u201d\n\nMany, like Wong, are now reconsidering whether to travel at all.", "description": "It was meant to be a quick trip over the border to see the dentist.
