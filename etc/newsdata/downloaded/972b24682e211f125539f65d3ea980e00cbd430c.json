It's good to take things slow\", he insisted.\n\n\"You wouldn't usually move in together so soon - I've only known her for two and a half months!\"\n\nCurtis responded to cast mate Anna Vakili's claims that most of the Love Island cast are no longer speaking and \"don't like each other\".\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"Everyone is very busy, but I stay in contact with as many people as possible really\", he said.\n\n\"I speak to the boys all the time - Chris, Michael, Anton, Callum. Some of the girls, like Molly Mae.\n\n\"But I'm with Maura, so I'm not going to stay in contact with the other girls too much. That's just the way I am.\"\n\nCurtis also revealed had a \"good little reunion\" with the other Love Island lads as he is currently filming a secret project with them.\n\nHim and Maura have been extremely busy since leaving the villa, with Curtis taking on an ambassador role for WW , formerly Weight Watchers, and he will be appearing as a guest choreographer on BBC Three's Ru Paul's Drag Race UK, and BBC One's The Greatest Dancer as a receptionist.\n\n(Image: REX)\n\nMeanwhile Maura has been dishing out relationship advice on This Morning, and signed promotional deals with Boohoo, Ann Summers, and McDonalds.\n\nHow does it work that Curtis is promoting healthy living with WW and Maura is plugging fast food?\n\n\"It's about moderation,\" explained Curtis.\n\n\"WW is not about saying no, but making smarter choices.\"\n\nHe took on the ambassador role after being cruelly fat shamed by Love Island viewers when he gained weight during filming, as he suddenly stopped exercising.\n\nIt was reported that ITV bosses had to bring in some bigger clothes as he went up a couple of sizes.\n\n(Image: Screen grab)\n\n\"Getting fat shamed in the villa was a small part of it, being in the public eye with my body and my look.\n\n\"I had always done crash diets and it's not good for your mental health or your physical health, I would lose weight by hardly eating and then once I stopped dancing I'd gain weight.\"\n\nCurtis said none other islanders contributed to his body shaming, but he was warned when he came out of the villa that people had been making comments about his body.\n\n\"We're in 2019, no one should be trying to belittle people or bullying them by body shaming. There's much more to the world than that\", Curtis said.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nHe deals with trolling by avoiding reading any comments on social media, never focusing on what other people think.\n\n\"I am who I am and I'm happy with that. And I have an amazing support network around me\", he explained.\n\n\"But obviously if I do read something negative it's discomforting, which is why I want to prove to myself and to everyone who has ever fat shamed me wrong.\"\n\nHe added: \"If I can be a role model to young people and even older people, then that's great. But I am doing it for myself.\"\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\nCurtis will be on our screens later on in the first ever series of Ru Paul's Drag Race UK with his Strictly Come Dancing professional brother AJ, as they did the dance coaching for the final three queens.\n\n\"It will be worth that wait\", said Curtis.\n\n\"It's hilarious and incredible. I fell in love with watching it.\"", "description": "Love Island's Curtis Pritchard has opened up about his relationship with Maura, how he deals with trolling, and why he doesn't speak to the girls from the villa", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Pa", "Rex", "Screen Grab", "Itv", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20465174.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Love-Island-TV-Show-Series-5-Episode-49-The-Final-Majorca-Spain-29-Jul-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
