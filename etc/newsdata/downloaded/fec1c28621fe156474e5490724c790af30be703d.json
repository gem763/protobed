But many lawmakers, campaigners, economists and businesses fear a no-deal Brexit would be economically devastating.\n\nLawmakers forced the government to publish its official assessment of the impact of leaving the EU on Oct. 31 without a divorce agreement. The document described potential food and medicine shortages, gridlock at ports and riots in the streets. Johnson insisted the bleak scenario was \u201cnot where we intend to end up.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve said it was extraordinary that a U.K. government \u201cis content on inflicting on the British public the level of disruption which is set out in the Yellowhammer papers.\u201d\n\nDefense Secretary Ben Wallace said the scenario was a \u201cplanning assumption\u201d and would only come true if the government did nothing to offset it. \u201cWe are spending the money on doing lots of things to mitigate those assumptions,\u201d he told the BBC.\n\nThe six-page classified document, dated Aug. 2, said the number of trucks crossing the main freight route between Calais and Dover would drop by between 40% and 60% within a day of a no-deal Brexit, with disruptions possibly lasting up to three months. The supply of certain types of fresh foods and essential medicines would decrease, prices would go up and poor people would be hit hardest, it said.\n\nThe paper also describes major disruption for travelers between Britain and the EU, uncertainty for U.K. citizens living in Europe, and says attempts to maintain an open border between Ireland and Northern Ireland would probably fail. It also says a no-deal exit could trigger major protests and even riots.\n\nThe government refused to comply with another part of Parliament\u2019s demand \u2014 that it hand over emails and texts among officials and aides discussing the government\u2019s decision to suspend Parliament for more than a month before the Brexit deadline. Michael Gove, the minister in charge of Brexit planning, said the request was inappropriate and disproportionate.\n\nOpposition lawmakers and rebel Conservatives have dealt the government\u2019s Brexit plans a series of blows. They passed a law that orders the government to seek a three-month delay to Brexit if no agreement has been reached by late October, rejected Johnson\u2019s call for a snap general election and ordered the release of the Yellowhammer document. Then on Tuesday, Johnson suspended Parliament for five weeks until Oct. 14, sparking outrage among legislators and several legal challenges.\n\nThe U.K. Supreme Court is set to consider next week whether the shutdown should be reversed, after conflicting rulings in lower courts.\n\nLast week, the High Court in London said the decision was inherently political and \u201cnot a matter for the courts.\u201d But Scotland\u2019s highest civil court ruled Wednesday that the shutdown was illegal \u201cbecause it had the purpose of stymieing Parliament.\u201d Johnson insists he suspended Parliament so that he can launch a fresh domestic agenda at a new session next month. He said he had \u201cabsolutely not\u201d misled the queen \u2014 whose formal approval was needed to suspend Parliament \u2014 about his motives.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, three linked cases had argued that a no-deal Brexit would undermine agreements between the British and Irish governments that were struck during the peace process. A no-deal Brexit could lead to the return of a hard border between the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland. An open border is crucial to the regional economy and underpins the peace process that ended decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.\n\nJudge Bernard McCloskey said the argument belonged in the world of politics, not law. \u201cVirtually all of the assembled evidence belongs to the world of politics, both national and supra-national,\u201d he said.\n\nIf the claimants appeal the ruling, the case could join two other legal challenges to Johnson\u2019s Brexit plans due to be heard at the U.K. Supreme Court next week.\n\nJohnson said Thursday he was \u201cworking very hard\u201d to strike a new deal with the bloc after the agreement made by his predecessor Theresa May was rejected three times by Britain\u2019s Parliament. Johnson\u2019s envoy David Frost has been holding talks in Brussels this week but no breakthrough has been made, and the EU says it is still waiting for firm proposals from the U.K.\n\nThe bloc\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, told reporters that \u201cwe are still ready to examine objectively any concrete and legally operational proposals from the U.K.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Johnson denied misleading Queen Elizabeth about his reasons for suspending Parliament, just weeks before the U.K. leaves the European Union", "authors": ["Jill Lawless"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/boris-johnson-queen-lies.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
