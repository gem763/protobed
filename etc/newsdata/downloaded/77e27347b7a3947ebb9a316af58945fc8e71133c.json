Those included former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Marie L. Yovanovitch, then the United States ambassador to Ukraine, and Ukrainians who disseminated damaging information during the 2016 campaign about Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.\n\nMr. Kent is one of a number of officials at the State Department and elsewhere in the administration who have been tapped by impeachment investigators to help corroborate the allegations in an intelligence whistle-blower\u2019s complaint that said the president abused his power to enlist a foreign power to interfere on his behalf in the 2020 elections.\n\nJohn Bolton was alarmed by the Ukraine affair and told an aide to alert White House lawyers about it.\n\nThe effort to pressure Ukraine for political help provoked a heated confrontation inside the White House last summer that so alarmed John R. Bolton, then the national security adviser, that he told an aide to alert White House lawyers, House investigators were told on Monday.\n\nMr. Bolton got into a tense exchange on July 10 with Gordon D. Sondland, the Trump donor turned ambassador to the European Union, who was working with Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, to press Ukraine to investigate Democrats, according to three people who heard the testimony.\n\nThe aide, Fiona Hill, testified that Mr. Bolton told her to notify the chief lawyer for the National Security Council about a rogue effort by Mr. Sondland, Mr. Giuliani and Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, according to the people familiar with the testimony.", "description": "Congress is back from recess and the investigation continues with more depositions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/15/us/politics/15impeach-briefing02/15impeach-briefing02-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
