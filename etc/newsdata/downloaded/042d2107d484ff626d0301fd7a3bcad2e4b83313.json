You know. So we like it. We\u2019re not going to stand up against it.\u2019 Well, who\u2019s to say that next week they\u2019re going to be playing on the blue team? It\u2019s crazy my friends.\n\nShe added that impeaching Trump is the \u201cappropriate remedy\u201d to the blatant \u201cassault on our democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am all in favor of what the House is doing and gathering the evidence and making the case because this president has to be held to account because of his unconstitutional abuse of power, his contempt of Congress, and his obstruction of justice,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nHer increased appearances and remarks have been driving speculation that former Democrat nominee is considering another presidential bid.\n\nTrump on Tuesday suggested that \u201cCrooked Hillary Clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren\u201d on the condition of explaining her \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting \u2018C\u2019 Subpoena!\u201d\n\nClinton replied, \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me.
