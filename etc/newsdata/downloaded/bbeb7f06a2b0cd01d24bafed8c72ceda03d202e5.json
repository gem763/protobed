REUTERS/Yves Herman\n\nAt a confirmation hearing, Belgian Foreign Minister Reynders told the European Parliament that money-laundering allegations made by a former Belgian spy were \u201cmalicious\u201d and were aimed at damaging his reputation.\n\n\u201cOn Saturday, September 14, I learned that serious accusations had been made against me by a person who was deliberately trying to damage my reputation,\u201d he told EU lawmakers, denying the allegations.\n\n\u201cAll of us unfortunately can be at risk of such malicious allegations,\u201d he said.\n\nReynders, one of the proposed members of the EU\u2019s executive Commission that will take office on Nov. 1, faces accusations that he took illicit payments linked to business deals in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kazakhstan and Libya.\n\nThose allegations were made by former intelligence agent Nicolas Ullens in April.\n\nA Brussels prosecutor on Friday shelved the inquiry, citing a lack of evidence.\n\nBut Ullens filed a new legal complaint on Monday, seen by Reuters, that accused Reynders of covering up a Belgian intelligence investigation into the allegations.\n\nAsked by one EU lawmaker if he had considered stepping aside while a new legal examination took its course, Reynders said: \u201cThere is no charge and so I don\u2019t have any intention to take a pause or organise a resignation.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s legal complaint is based on copies of 18 intelligence service reports between 2009 and 2015 that accuse Reynders and several other government officials of money laundering, Ullens told Reuters on Monday.\n\nA spokesman for Reynders told Reuters on Tuesday the veteran politician considered the first case closed and referred questions on the second to Reynders\u2019 lawyer, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cThe same people will try again and maybe again and again and I will have the same reaction with my lawyer,\u201d Reynders told EU lawmakers at the hearing.\n\nEuropean Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen is seeking a strong mandate to deal with challenges ranging from populist, anti-EU politicians inside the European Union as well as climate change and a more assertive China.\n\nVon der Leyen has said there should be \u201cno room for doubt\u201d about the standing of her commissioners.\n\nThe justice commissioner will play an important role seeking to uphold the rule of law, particularly in Poland and Hungary, where the bloc has been unable to slow what it sees as a slide away from democracy.", "description": "Didier Reynders, Belgium's pick for EU justice commissioner, denied on Wednesday corruption allegations against him and said he would continue to seek the post because he had not been charged.", "authors": ["Robin Emmott", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436232498&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910Y0"}
