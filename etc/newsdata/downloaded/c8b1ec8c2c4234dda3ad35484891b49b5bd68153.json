For the magazine's annual Women in Hollywood issue, Paltrow posed in nothing but pants and a set of suspenders, saying that she came into the industry and heard that it was unusual for women to be ambitious. She didn't let that notion sit with her, however. Instead, she turned acting into a veritable goop global empire that spans books, an upcoming Netflix series, global summits, and an online destination for wellness.\n\n\"In the '90s, when I was coming up, it was a very male-dominated field,\" she said. \"You used to hear, 'That actress is so ambitious,' like it was a dirty word.\" Now, she insists, her \"ambition has been unleashed.\"\n\nNBC/Getty Images More\n\nRELATED: Gwyneth Paltrow Looks Like 15-Year-Old Daughter Apple Martin's Twin in This Rare Instagram Photo\n\nPaltrow, who has said that she wants goop to be her lasting legacy, took a hiatus from the entertainment industry to focus on her brand.
