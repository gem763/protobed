Whether you\u2019re China, our most formidable adversary, or Ukraine, a partner, what the president has said is, you manufacture, make up some fake dirt on my opponent, and I\u2019ll give you what you want. It\u2019s always a quid pro quo with him. In the case of Ukraine, he extorted up to $400 million in military assistance and a White House visit and withheld both until he thought he could get satisfaction from the Ukrainians in terms of making up dirt on Biden.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cTo call on China from the South Lawn of the White House to interfere in our elections and to create dirt on Biden that doesn\u2019t exist, in the next sentence, after he said, you know, we can punish them and do all these things with respect to trade? The clear implication, in Beijing, they\u2019re no dummies, what I\u2019m sure they heard is if they give Trump what he wants on Biden, then they might get what they want on trade and national security. Can you imagine? After all, Americans have suffered through Donald Trump\u2019s trade war. All our farmers have suffered. All of our manufacturers have suffered. All that we as taxpayers have suffered because we\u2019re the ones paying these tariffs, and he says to the Chinese in effect, let\u2019s make a deal.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Thursday's broadcast of\u00a0MSNBC's \"Andrea Mitchell Reports,\" former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice criticized President Donald Trump for | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Susan-rice-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
