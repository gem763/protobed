But the real thing that\u2019s bothering, I think, a lot of people also is that the House Intel Committee chair has been accused of lying about his contacts with the so-called whistleblower.\u201d\n\nCorke was referencing the New York Times report that the whistleblower who sounded the alarm over Trump seeking foreign assistance in the upcoming election contacted the House Intelligence Committee early on to seek guidance on filing their complaint. Schiff has faced criticism, largely from Republicans and conservatives, for claiming he has not had contact with the whistleblower.\n\nThe Times, however, reported that the whistleblower contacted a committee aide, Schiff wasn\u2019t personally in contact with the whistleblower, and the congressman was not aware of the whistleblower\u2019s identity or the full account of the complaint.\n\nCorke has a history of flirting with or embracing fringe conspiracy theories and far-right politics. In May 2017, Corke mass-deleted tweets promoting baseless alt-right conspiracies after The Daily Beast spotted them. Earlier this year, he excited followers of the crazed pro-Trump QAnon conspiracy when he tweeted a picture of a coffee cup emblazoned with the letter \u201cQ,\u201d adding the caption: \u201cMy kind of coffee.\u201d (He later deleted the tweet.)\n\nCorke finished his Wednesday morning dispatch by telling the Fox & Friends hosts he gets to see all these developments \u201cfrom the catbird seat at the White House.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, it was just a few months ago when Trump took a break while speaking to reporters on the White House lawn to shake Corke\u2019s hand and compliment the Fox correspondent for treating him \u201cfairly.\u201d", "description": "The White House reporter, who has long flirted with alt-right conspiracies, also referred to the source of the Ukraine scandal as a \u201cso-called\u201d whistleblower.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1080,w_1920,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570642110/fox-and-friends_33_w1lzgi", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
