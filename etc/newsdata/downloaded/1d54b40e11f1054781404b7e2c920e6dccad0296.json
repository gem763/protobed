Reports say one fire was near downed power lines in the city of Fontana.\n\nIn the hills south of San Bernardino, another fire broke out. Winds there were gusting up to 30 mph, hampering firefighters trying to protect buildings. This has led to 14,000 Southern Californians going without power.\n\nA wildfire rages in Southern California CBS News\n\nIn the northern part of the state, hundreds of thousands of customers have been living in the dark since Wednesday when PG&E orchestrated a rolling blackout in a desperate effort to prevent its equipment from igniting fires.\n\nSouthern California utilities have been hesitating to shut down electric grids on a massive scale in an effort to stem a customer backlash.\n\nWhere to cut power has not been a perfect science.
