REUTERS/Stephane Mahe\n\nRoglic, 29, successfully defended his sizeable lead over second-placed Alejandro Valverde in the 21st stage of the race, a 106.6km ride from Fuenlabada to the centre of Madrid which was won by Dutchman Fabio Jakobsen.\n\nWorld champion Valverde finished 19th in the stage, 17 seconds ahead of Roglic, who ended the race two minutes 16 seconds ahead of the Spaniard overall.\n\nRoglic\u2019s compatriot Tadej Pogacar took the final position on the podium, two minutes 38 seconds back, rounding off a stunning race for the 20-year-old, who earned three stage wins on his Grand Tour debut.\n\n\u201cWinning this race is a great feeling and to be up here with another Slovenian makes it even better, it\u2019s great news for cycling in our country,\u201d Roglic said from the podium outside the Cibeles palace in Madrid.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had time to think about all of this, but all I know is that me and the team rode together to make history.\u201d\n\nRoglic has only been a professional cyclist since 2012, making the leap into the sport after an impressive junior career in ski jumping, winning the junior world championships in 2007.\n\nHe was among the favourites to win a Vuelta lacking in household names and showed remarkable consistency throughout the race, despite a rocky start which saw him and his Jumbo-Visma team mates involved in a mass crash on the opening stage.\n\nThe Slovenian lost 40 seconds to early leader Miguel Angel Lopez as a result of that crash but came flying back into contention on stage 10 with a superb victory on the individual time trial to take the red jersey from Nairo Quintana.\n\nHis time trial exploits gave him a commanding lead of three minutes and although Quintana and Valverde traded places as Roglic\u2019s closest challenger, the Slovenian rarely looked like surrendering his advantage.\n\nHe did suffer a scare when he crashed on stage 19 and Valverde\u2019s Movistar team attacked to the outrage of many in the peloton as cycling etiquette dictates that no attacks are allowed if a race leader crashes or has a mechanical.\n\nValverde eventually caved in to the protests and Roglic was allowed to catch up with the peloton, and he virtually sealed the overall victory by surviving Saturday\u2019s gruelling mountain stage to Plataforma de Gredos.", "description": "Primoz Roglic became the first Slovenian to win a Grand Tour when he was crowned Vuelta a Espana champion by completing Sunday's processional final stage into Madrid.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430182931&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E0OJ", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
