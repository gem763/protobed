This is a pain in the ass. I\u2019ve been this for a month. This is the most difficult thing I\u2019ve ever done. I\u2019m not in it to start a conversation about the debt.\u201d\n\nLast month Sanford told Fox News he would vote for the president next year if Trump wins the GOP nomination and a progressive candidate captures the Democratic nomination.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to vote conservative and I\u2019m going to vote for the conservative choice,\u201d he explained.\n\nWalsh, of Illinois, again targeted Sanford, saying if \u201cTrump is the eventual nominee, Sanford\u2019s going to vote for him. That\u2019s like crazy. Trump\u2019s unfit. He\u2019s a danger to the country. Sanford\u2019s not serious.\u201d\n\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN TIGHTENS GRIP ON DELEGATE SELECTION PROCESS TO AVOID DRAMA AT 2020 GOP CONVENTION\n\nWalsh spoke with Fox News after arriving in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire on Tuesday, two days after he and Sanford battled over the Trump impeachment inquiry during a joint appearance Sunday on CNN.\n\nWhile Sanford\u2019s not sold on the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry over the Ukrainian controversy that\u2019s threatening Trump\u2019s presidency, Walsh doesn\u2019t have any qualms.\n\n\u201cLook, he\u2019s going to be impeached. He should be impeached. He\u2019s going to be a disaster if he\u2019s at the top of our ticket next year,\u201d Walsh charged.\n\nTrump\u2019s under fire over his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he urged Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter over their dealings in the eastern European country that\u2019s been battling Russia. Fueled by whistleblower complaints and a transcript of the call released by the White House, Democrats argue the president was asking a foreign country to potentially interfere in a U.S. election.\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted that he did nothing wrong and has on numerous occasions described his conversation with the Ukrainian leader as \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\n\nWalsh charged that \u201cTrump\u2019s a traitor. When you invite and or pressure a foreign government to screw around with our elections, that\u2019s a betrayal of this country. Trump\u2019s done that from the moment he got elected. He\u2019s probably the most disloyal president this country\u2019s ever had.\u201d\n\nPolling indicates the president remains extremely popular among Republicans and crushes his GOP challenges in the latest primary surveys.\n\nBut Walsh insists Trump\u2019s \u201csupport is soft.\u201d\n\nPointing to Republicans he\u2019s talked to on the campaign trail who support a primary challenge to the president, Walsh said, \u201cAlmost everyone said \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m sick of it. Yeah, I\u2019m exhausted with him, but what else am I going to do.\u2019 I hear that over and over.\n\n\u201cI think that the vast majority of Republicans don\u2019t want four more years of this president\u2019s bulls--t. I just don\u2019t think they do,\u201d he insisted.\n\nWalsh arrived in the Granite State as the third Trump primary challenger, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, was campaigning in the state. Weld is targeting independents, who can vote in New Hampshire\u2019s GOP primary as well as contests in nearly two dozen other states.\n\n\u201cI got a different strategy. I\u2019m going right at Republican voters,\u201d Walsh explained.\n\nAnd he predicted that \u201cit will work itself out...Bill Weld\u2019s a great guy. He seems to be focused on New Hampshire. I don\u2019t think Mark Sanford is serious at all. I don\u2019t know how long he\u2019ll be around. I think this race will coalesce around one alternative to Trump.\u201d\n\nWalsh has baggage of his own. After jumping into the race this summer, he apologized for past racist comments on Twitter.\n\n\u201cThere have been times over the last six or seven years when I went over my skies and said things that I regretted,\u201d he noted. \u201cI\u2019ve apologized for helping to create Trump, for helping to create the toxic environment that helped to create Trump. Look, I was part of that Tea Party wave in 2010. I went to DC to raise hell about all of this debt and the bankrupting of the country by both parties.\u201d", "description": "Joe Walsh is not only slamming President Trump, he\u2019s saving some of his firepower for one of his fellow long-shot GOP presidential primary challengers.", "authors": ["Paul Steinhauser", "Paul Steinhauser Is A Politics Reporter Based In New Hampshire."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/08/26/694940094001_6077484142001_6077489464001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
