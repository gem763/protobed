But it is still powerful and appears likely to get dangerously near Charleston, South Carolina, which is particularly vulnerable since it is located on a peninsula. Businesses are boarded up around the city and some people have been in shelters for days.\n\nGovernor Henry McMaster warned residents in evacuation zones to \u201cget out now\u201d.\n\nThere was still time for people to leave at-risk areas, he said, but they should do so immediately.\n\nFloridians still divided over climate crisis as Dorian rages Read more\n\nOn Monday, McMaster ordered 830,000 to leave areas likely to be affected. Charleston was among the mandatory evacuation zones, along with parts of counties to the north.\n\n\u201cOnce the wind speeds reach up to 40mph, we can no longer come in to get you,\u201d McMaster said, according to the South Carolina news channel WBTW News 13. \u201cIt is the water that kills people. It is the water that is the real danger. And it is clear we\u2019re going to have a lot of water.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chris Creel, manager of Piggly Wiggly, stocks pallets of bottled water as grocery customers prepare for the arrival of storm weather with Hurricane Dorian in New Bern, North Carolina.

The record is 12.5ft, set by Hurricane Hugo in 1989.\n\nDorian, now a category 2 storm, was still off the eastern coast of Florida on Wednesday, moving slowly to the north. A hurricane warning covered about 500 miles of coastline.\n\nApproximately 396,000 North Carolina residents were under mandatory evacuation orders, according to a state joint information center spokeswoman.\n\nIn the Bahamas, the devastation wrought by Dorian and the terror it inflicted during its day-and-a-half mauling of the northern islands came into focus on Wednesday as the passing of the storm revealed a muddy, debris-strewn landscape of smashed and flooded-out homes on Abaco and Grand Bahama.\n\nOfficially, the death toll from the strongest hurricane on record ever to hit the country stood at seven, but there was little doubt it would rise.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An aerial photograph released by the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) on Wednesday shows destruction in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian on the island of Great Abaco in the northern Bahamas on 3 September.

In one community, George Bolter stood in bright sunshine and surveyed what was once his home. He picked at the debris, trying to find something salvageable. A couple of walls were the only things left.\n\n\u201cI have lost everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI have lost all my baby\u2019s clothes, my son\u2019s clothes. We have nowhere to stay, nowhere to live. Everything is gone.\u201d\n\nThe Bahamian government sent hundreds of police officers and marines into the stricken islands, along with doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers, in an effort to reach drenched and stunned victims and take the full measure of the disaster.\n\n\u201cRight now there are just a lot of unknowns,\u201d the parliament member Iram Lewis said. \u201cWe need help.\u201d\n\nThe US coast guard, Britain\u2019s Royal Navy and relief organisations including the United Nations and the Red Cross joined a burgeoning effort to rush food and medicine to survivors and lift the most desperate to safety.
