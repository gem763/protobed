(Interestingly, there's a whisper that a way back could soon emerge for some of the 21 MPs who were booted out.)\n\nThat \"long shopping list\" of errors, according to one member of the cabinet, means the prime minister's self-imposed Halloween Brexit deadline looks further out of reach than a few short days ago.\n\nIs it impossible? Absolutely not.\n\nThere is the possibility, still, of a deal, with Number 10 today stressing it was still their primary aim.\n\nWhispers again about a Northern Ireland only backstop, and a bigger role for the Stormont assembly, if it ever gets up and running, are doing the rounds.\n\nSome MPs, and some diplomats are more cheerful now about the possibilities of it working out.\n\nIf you squint you can see the chance of an agreement being wrapped up at pace, although it seems the chances range somewhere between slim and negligible.\n\nIt is still possible too, as Number 10 bombastically suggests, that they could just ignore the demand from Parliament that he seeks a delay if there is no-deal.\n\nThis is not as straightforward as ignoring a parking ticket, of course.\n\nBut if the prime minister asks formally, but politically makes it clear he doesn't want it and would do nothing with it, would the EU really force such a policy on an unwilling government with no political reason given? What if the EU was to offer only an extension of several years?\n\nThese are not predictions, but they are imponderables, talking about a political landscape that is some weeks off, and there are all sorts of political gymnastics to come before then that could again turn the situation on its head.\n\nAnd for all that Parliament protests, some Brexiteers, including in Number 10, glory in 'evidence' they could use in an eventual election campaign that tries to pit MPs against the people.\n\nNo question, however, it's been a bruising period for the prime minister, which could be the beginning of a very rapid downfall.\n\nBut just as so many things in politics have changed in the last few years, some of the old truths remain.\n\nA week is still a long time in politics - the seven weeks before Halloween another age.", "description": "After a bruising period for the PM, Number 10 stresses a deal is the government's aim and a lot can happen before Parliament meets again.", "authors": ["Laura Kuenssberg", "Political Editor"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E396/production/_108726285_mediaitem108726282.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
