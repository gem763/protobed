He has appeared only twice at prime minister\u2019s questions during his time in No 10.\n\n\u201cThis is the only select committee that can call the prime minister, and this is now the third time that he\u2019s cancelled, despite having given a clear reassurance during the leadership campaign that he would come at an early opportunity,\u201d Wollaston told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.\n\n\u201cSo I think that\u2019s the point here. He knows that he\u2019s been prime minister for months now, he\u2019s only had two appearances at prime minister\u2019s questions, and again not facing this kind of detailed scrutiny, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good enough.\n\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s extraordinary to have now cancelled on three occasions, and last time he cancelled, he submitted himself to 14 minutes of Facebook live questions with presubmitted questions.\u201d\n\nJohnson wrote to Wollaston on Wednesday night promising that he would at some point keep a previous promise to appear before the committee, but saying he could not do so on Thursday.\n\n\u201cI am afraid I must now focus on delivering Brexit in the difficult circumstances in which we now find ourselves,\u201d he said in a scrawled note.\n\n\u201cI believe I would be of greater value if I could postpone for a fixed date nearer five or six months after I became PM, so that my appearance took place after roughly the same period in office as Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Theresa May. I do hope you understand.\u201d\n\nIn a written reply, Wollaston said: \u201cOur role as select committee chairs is to ask you detailed questions on behalf of the public and we planned to do so on Brexit, climate change, health and social care. It is unacceptable that you are refusing to be held to account.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s original appearance before the committee on 11 September was cancelled after parliament was suspended in the early hours of the day before.\n\nThe supreme court later ruled prorogation was unlawful, meaning the session did not technically end at all.\n\nThe judges criticised the length and timing of the earlier suspension. Lady Hale, the supreme court president, said the prime minister\u2019s decision to move for a five-week suspension \u201chad the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions\u201d.\n\nAfter suspending parliament for a second time in October, missing another scheduled prime minister\u2019s questions the following Wednesday, the shadow leader of the House of Commons, Valerie Vaz, said Johnson had appeared once out of a possible four appearances.\n\n\u201cHe is like Macavity the mystery cat; he is called the hidden paw \u2026 although maybe, in the prime minister\u2019s case, it is the not-so-hidden paws,\u201d she told MPs.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said Johnson had spent the morning when he was supposed to be questioned by MPs holding meetings with members of his team and cabinet.\n\n\u201cSince taking office, he has spent more than 14 hours at the dispatch box taking questions from colleagues across the house,\u201d the spokesman said.", "description": "PM criticised for cancelling appearance before liaison committee at short notice", "authors": ["Rajeev Syal"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8369a3071d58d426ce72ca23ab8b4697267eaca2/0_66_1560_936/master/1560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=293a6ef32dad8c451cf1ffd699b5247f", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
