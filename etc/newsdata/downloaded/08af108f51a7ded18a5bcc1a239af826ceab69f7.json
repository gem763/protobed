A spokesman for Malaysia's prime minister did not respond to Reuters' questions.\n\nMany Iranians said they knew of dozens of compatriots who had received notices from CIMB and RHB Bank.\n\n\"We regret to inform (you) that we are unable to continue the banking relationship,\" CIMB said in identical notices reviewed by Reuters.\n\nThe banks did not state a reason, but some individuals said bank officials attributed the move to tighter scrutiny after the sanctions.\n\nCIMB and RHB declined to comment. Malaysia's central bank directed queries to the Association of Banks in Malaysia, which declined to comment.\n\nSuch matters depended on individual banks' own risk appetite and assessment, the central bank said this month in an email response to one Iranian's complaint that was viewed by Reuters.\n\nBut a July notification on the central bank's website refers to a statement by the Financial Action Task Force urging \"enhanced due diligence\" on Iranians by members of the global money laundering watchdog.\n\nIran's embassy in Kuala Lumpur said it was working to resolve the issue.\n\n\"We hope that by goodwill and cooperation of the Malaysian officials, the negotiations will yield a positive result,\" it told Reuters in an email last week, adding that Iranian companies had also been affected.\n\nFor now, Iranians in the Malaysian capital have been left wondering how to pay school fees or hospital bills.\n\n\"Without a bank account we need to use the ancient techniques, keeping money under the pillow or in teapots,\" said one of them, who sought anonymity. \"It's not fair.\"", "description": "Some say that US sanctions on Iran in July are a factor in the 'mass closures' of Iranian accounts in Malaysian banks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/30/c53015753d324b3b8c38f900a332ef6c_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
