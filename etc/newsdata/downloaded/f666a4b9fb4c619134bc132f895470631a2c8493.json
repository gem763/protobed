For far too long, there has been a lack of transparency around how some car dealers make commission on sales. This has resulted in some customers overpaying for their loans by millions of pounds a year, but not really having any real idea by how much.\n\n\u201cNow the FCA has shone a light on some of the shady ways commission is made, we expect to see more competition in the market and better deals for consumers.\u201d", "description": "Drivers will save around \u00a3165m a year under a crackdown on certain types of commission that give salesmen and brokers an incentive to overcharge customers.
