I\u2019ve experienced that individually, as a unit and as a team. So you\u2019ve got to - as they say - keep chopping. You never know when you\u2019re about to break through.\u201d\n\nThe numbers don\u2019t lie.\n\nIndy\u2019s defense heads into Sunday\u2019s game against Oakland (1-2) ranked in the bottom half of the league in yards rushing, yards passing and total yards allowed. Only six teams have fewer takeaways than the Colts\u2018 three and last week Indianapolis allowed the Falcons to convert eight of 10 third downs.\n\nAgain, the Colts (2-1) won\u2019t be at full strength. Starting safety Malik Hooker could miss more than a month with an injured knee, All-Pro linebacker Darius Leonard was still in the concussion protocol this week, and after No. 1 cornerback Pierre Desir fought his way back from a bruised knee last week, he\u2019s now dealing with an injured hamstring.\n\nThe Raiders pose an intriguing matchup. While their offense has struggled through the first three weeks, Indy can put on the tape from last year\u2019s 42-28 shootout and see just how dangerous Oakland can be.\n\nOr the Colts can listen to coach Jon Gruden giving his team a similar message about getting back on track.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and say that we are a finished product yet,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through a lot of change through the first three weeks and we played two really good teams, actually three really good defenses.\u201d\n\nAnd the Colts think they can make it four good defenses in a row.\n\n\u201cJust keep believing, keep trusting and keep working, the breakthrough is just around the corner,\u201d Reich said. \u201cThat\u2019s our mentality.\u201d\n\nTRAVELING SHOW\n\nThe Raiders will go straight from Indianapolis to London, where they will spend the week practicing before a \u201chome\u201d game against Chicago. Oakland is in the midst of a stretch that features 48 days between games at the Oakland Coliseum, with four road games, one off week, and the trip to London. This week marks the second of five straight games that start at 10 a.m. PT. Oakland has lost seven straight in the early Sunday time slot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an odd travel schedule I guess,\u201d tight end Darren Waller said. \u201cBut I feel like we have the guys to lock in and get it done.\u201d\n\nHOME, SWEET, HOME\n\nAfter losing their first two home games last season, the Colts have reeled off seven straight wins, the second-longest active streak behind New England (15).\n\nIndy also has scored at least 23 points in nine consecutive home games, tied for the league\u2019s third-longest streak with the Los Angeles Rams and behind New England (13) and Kansas City (12). There\u2019s little doubt among the players the noise and atmosphere have helped.\n\n\u201cYou felt the energy coming into the stadium and they played a big part in a tough game,\u201d Colts quarterback Jacoby Brissett said after last week\u2019s game. \u201cI think they were one of the biggest difference makers in the game because it\u2019s so hard.\u201d\n\nRECEIVER SHUFFLE\n\nThe Raiders are still looking for the right receiver combination after Antonio Brown was released two days before the season opener. That move forced Tyrell Williams into a bigger role, and another free agent receiver, Ryan Grant, didn\u2019t work out. The former Indy player was benched last week and released Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s caused us a little bit of rethinking,\u201d Gruden said about the loss of Brown. \u201cWhen you lose your starting (flanker), who arguably is a great player - I don\u2019t think anyone is going to dispute that - you have to replace him, and we\u2019re making an effort to move Tyrell around, bringing on some younger guys.\u201d\n\nMACK ATTTACK\n\nAfter being stout against the run the first two weeks, allowing 63 yards a game and 2.8 yards per carry, the Raiders gave up 211 yards last week to Minnesota. The Raiders face another strong test this week against Marlon Mack , the league\u2019s No. 3 rusher, and a Colts team averaging 4.9 yards per carry. Mack ran 16 times for 74 yards and one TD last week, but gashed the Raiders last year for 132 yards and two scores.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Josh Dubow contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Indianapolis Colts coach Frank Reich has seen the numbers and watched the tape.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Marot"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/raiders_vikings_football_32095_c0-181-4325-2702_s1770x1032.jpg?3ad6f3cb8a9fa6a0e707eb490b798233b5273532", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
