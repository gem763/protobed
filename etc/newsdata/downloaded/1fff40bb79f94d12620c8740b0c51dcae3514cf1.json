It\u2019s the Irwins\u2019.\n\nSteve owned and operated Australia Zoo, founded by Irwin's parents in Brisbane in 1970. Robert is himself now a wildlife presenter, and stars with mum Terri and sister Bindi in the documentary series following the family as they live and work at the zoo.\n\nViewers were shocked as footage showed Robert wrestling with a crocodile , similar to how his dad once had.\n\nRobert said: \"It looks crazy jumping on giant crocodile but it's a technique started by dad.\n\n\"It doesn't stress out the crocodile, we blindfold them to make sure they're calm.\n\n\"In the wild, they'll fight to the death, but for us we're really just securing them. For them, it's like being jumped on by bean bags - we're all soft and squishy.\"\n\nSteve Irwin was a zookeeper turned TV star who earned worldwide fame for his affinity with crocodiles and the ease in which he could tame them.\n\nThe beloved \"crocodile hunter\" died at the age of 44 in 2006 after a fatal encounter with a stingray at Batt Reef in Queensland.\n\nHe left behind wife Terri , daughter Bindi and son Robert, who was only 2 years old when he passed away.\n\nRobert shares an uncanny resemblance to his famous father, and recently shocked social media when he re-created an iconic photograph of his father feeding Australia Zoo's most dangerous crocodile 'Murray'.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe teenager opened up about the Irwins' family aim with their documentary series.\n\nHe said: \"As a family, we get to follow in dad's footsteps. We aren't trying to be him, but we are trying to finish what he started\".\n\nRobert's mum Teri, who also lives and works in the zoo, also appeared on Sky news.\n\nThe 55-year-old conservationist appeared to embarrass her children Bindi and Robert slightly as she recalled the moment they \"helped a koala have sex during filming\".\n\nShe also used the opportunity to reminisce about her lat husband's legacy.\n\nShe said: \"The world is full of dangers and wildlife is one of the least dangerous parts. Like Steve used to say, 'if something bites me, it's my mistake'.\"\n\nAs the family plan to continue Steve's mission of teaching people about animals, Irwins' daughter Bindi is set to get married next year.\n\nThe 21-year-old recently revealed she wil be getting married at the zoo and that her brother Robert will walk her down the aisle (probably with a few animals too).", "description": "Steve Irwin's lookalike teenage son Robert aims to follow in his dad's iconic footsteps and finish the work that he started", "authors": ["Tiffany Wallis", "Image", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20546645.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RLP_MDG_18349JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
