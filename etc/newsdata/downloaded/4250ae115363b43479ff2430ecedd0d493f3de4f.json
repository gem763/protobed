REUTERS/Christian Hartmann\n\nBrent crude futures LCOc1 rose 8 cents to $63.68 a barrel by 0507 GMT while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 was up 14 cents to $58.25 a barrel.\n\nThe steadying of nerves, after a 14.6% jump in Brent prices on Monday - the contract\u2019s biggest one-day percentage gain since at least 1988 - came after Saudi Arabia set out the timeline to full operation, and also said it had managed to restore supplies to customers at levels prior to the attacks by drawing from its oil inventories.\n\nSaudi Arabia, the world\u2019s leading oil exporter, has said the crippling attack on its oil sites was \u201cunquestionably sponsored\u201d by bitter regional rival Iran. U.S. President Donald Trump said there were many options short of war with Iran and added that he had ordered the U.S. Treasury to \u201csubstantially increase sanctions\u201d on Tehran. Iran has denied involvement in the strikes.\n\n\u201cPrices may have found equilibrium for now,\u201d said Michael McCarthy, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney. Quick recovery in Saudi oil production would confirm disruption could be temporary, he said.\n\nOil analytics firm Kayrros estimated Saudi Arabia lost about 3.4 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil output after crude oil inventories plunged nearly 10 million barrels as of Sept. 16 compared with pre-attack levels.\n\nStill, the head of the International Energy Agency said on Wednesday it does not see a need to release emergency oil stocks as markets are well supplied.\n\nWhile tensions in the Middle East remained elevated, the White House\u2019s response on Wednesday to Saudi producing evidence that it said implicated Iran in the attacks pointed to a more measured approach in handling the region\u2019s issues, said McCarthy at CMC Markets.\n\nFollowing the attacks in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait\u2019s oil sector is on high alert and has raised its security to the highest level as a precautionary measure, a Kuwaiti oil official said on Wednesday.\n\nSeparately, weekly data from the Energy Information Administration on U.S. oil inventories provided a mixed snapshot.\n\nCrude oil stockpiles at the world\u2019s largest oil producer rose by 1.1 million barrels last week against analysts\u2019 expectations for a drop of 2.5 million barrels.\n\nHowever, stocks in Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for benchmark futures, fell to the lowest since October 2018.
