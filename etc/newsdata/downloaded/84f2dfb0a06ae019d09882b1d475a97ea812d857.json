That Set Off an Activist Challenge.", "language": "en", "text": "Randall Stephenson, AT&T Inc. \u2019s longtime boss, got an unexpected phone call Sunday evening from a hedge-fund manager at Elliott Management Corp., one of Wall Street\u2019s biggest and most aggressive activist investors.\n\nThe call was brief and cordial, but behind it was a stinging rebuke of the telecom veteran\u2019s mission to turn the phone company into a media giant and leave a top lieutenant to finish the job. Investor Jesse Cohn told Mr. Stephenson the hedge fund had concerns about AT&T\u2019s strategy and execution, reflecting worries percolating around the company, said people familiar with the matter. Mr. Stephenson alerted his lead director.\n\nThe next day, Elliott Management issued a 23-page report that publicly questioned the logic of AT&T\u2019s $49 billion takeover of DirecTV in 2015, shortly before cord-cutting accelerated, and its $81 billion deal last year to buy Time Warner, home of HBO and Warner Bros, only to replace almost all of its experienced entertainment bosses.\n\nElliott\u2019s report Monday also questioned whether Mr. Stephenson\u2019s presumed successor could successfully integrate the conglomerate into a force able to compete for advertising dollars against the likes of Google and win a costly battle for streaming supremacy with rivals like Netflix Inc. and Walt Disney Co.\n\nJesse Cohn during a panel at Rock Center/SVDX speaker series in 2016.

The three-decade company veteran\u2014who said HBO\u2019s \u201cSuccession\u201d was one of his favorite TV shows\u2014has signaled interest in stepping down as soon as next year, people familiar with his thinking said.\n\nMr. Cohn is seeking sweeping changes despite Elliott owning a $3.2 billion, or roughly 1%, stake in AT&T shares and options. Other activists have used similar stakes to shake up corporations as big as Procter & Gamble Co. and General Electric Co. , often taking seats on the board.\n\nThe offices of Elliott Management Corp. in New York City.

Elliott must decide by the end of January whether to initiate a proxy fight, but Mr. Cohn told Mr. Stephenson that he wanted to work together.\n\nAT&T said it looked forward to engaging with Elliott, and that it was already pursuing some actions laid out in Elliott\u2019s report: \u201cAT&T\u2019s Board and management team firmly believe that the focused and successful execution of our strategy is the best path forward.\u201d\n\nMr. Stephenson, who declined to comment, has defended his strategy, saying AT&T is boosting its programming investments, helping HBO compete with growing numbers of streaming services and harnessing data from its phone and TV customers to compete with the biggest ad platforms. He has said AT&T\u2019s subscriber pool offers its media units a broad distribution system.\n\n\u201cThe business model does have to change,\u201d he said after winning an antitrust case last fall to buy Time Warner. He will get a chance to make his case to investors Tuesday when he takes the stage at a Goldman Sachs conference in New York.\n\nDespite the high-profile acquisitions, AT&T shares have been flat since Mr. Stephenson took over. They hit a multiyear low near $27 in December as investors worried about the more than $160 billion in debt the company had accumulated from its acquisitions. The shares had gained 33% this year before Elliott released its letter.\n\nAT&T's Strategic Shift CEO Randall Stephenson took over AT&T in 2007 shortly after the company had acquired BellSouth and the Cingular Wireless joint venture. He has expanded into media by buying DirecTV in 2015 and Time Warner in 2018. Segment revenue, in billions* Wireline 59% Wireless 35% 2007 $122.3 Other 2% Advertising Solutions 5% Wireless 41% Entertainment 27% (DirecTV, consumer wireline) 2018 $173.3 Business wireline 15% WarnerMedia 11% (HBO, Turner, Warner Bros.) Other 5%\u2020\n\nSam Hendel, president of Levin Easterly Partners, which owns roughly 3.5 million shares of AT&T, said he sees potential, particularly in wireless as 5G networks expand. Time Warner is a great asset, he said, but he agreed with Elliott that AT&T has to add experience in media to the board and senior management.\n\nElliott, which is run by billionaire Paul Singer and manages about $38 billion, is known for its 15-year crusade to get Argentina to make payments on defaulted bonds and for battles with chief executives, including at Arconic Inc.\n\nThe Communications Workers of America, a union that represents about 100,000 AT&T employees, said Elliott\u2019s push would cut its workforce. \u201cAnyone who thinks that Paul Singer and Elliott Management intend to \u2018deliver far-reaching benefits\u2019 to AT&T\u2019s customers is not familiar with the destruction this vulture hedge fund leaves in its wake,\u201d CWA President Chris Shelton said.\n\nConglomerates have fallen out of favor on Wall Street, where many investors now prefer nimble, focused companies. Investors this year have valued AT&T, which has about 30% more revenue, a top Hollywood studio and popular cable channels, slightly more than Verizon Communications Inc., which has largely stuck to the wireless business. These days, AT&T looks more like Comcast Corp. , a cable operator that owns NBCUniversal and Sky.\n\n\u201cWhen I was there, it was focused on becoming the biggest and best telecommunications company in the world and we sort of stuck to what we knew,\u201d said Edward Whitacre, who as chief executive from 1990 to 2007 rebuilt AT&T into a nationwide giant by snapping up regional Baby Bells. \u201cBut time has moved on and maybe they made the decisions that they had to make.\u201d\n\nNext in line\n\nLast month, one of AT&T\u2019s top executives, John Donovan, announced his plan to retire after finding out he wasn\u2019t getting the top job. Soon after, AT&T\u2019s board met to approve the promotion of John Stankey, one of Mr. Stephenson\u2019s longtime allies, to a newly created role of president and operating chief, making him the heir apparent.\n\nMr. Stankey, 56, joined one of the Baby Bells in 1985 and rose through the ranks. He and Mr. Stephenson share a friendship built through more than two decades as the regional phone company grew into the second-largest wireless carrier in the U.S.\n\nJohn Stankey, AT&T president and operating chief.

The move pushed aside veteran executives in each company. He has clashed with those below him, according to former executives, and seen by some as imperious. HBO boss Richard Plepler and Turner chief David Levy left.\n\nThe board voted unanimously to approve Mr. Stankey\u2019s promotion, spurring Elliott to go public with its stake, according to people familiar with the matter. The hedge fund had been studying AT&T since the Time Warner deal. It viewed the promotion of Mr. Stankey to oversee both media and companywide operations as hasty, the people said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Stankey fan,\u201d said Mr. Whitacre, the former AT&T CEO, who described him as a smart strategic thinker.\n\nAT&T will resist any attempt to dictate its executive suite, according to people close to the company. Board members see room to improve AT&T\u2019s performance but support Mr. Stephenson\u2019s strategy and praise Mr. Stankey\u2019s leadership, according to a person familiar with the board\u2019s thinking.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t many people from the outside who would be obvious candidates to run a complicated media and communications business,\u201d the person said. \u201cA lot of people who run media companies don\u2019t know anything about operating a telecom business.\u201d\n\nThat raises the prospect of a protracted, monthslong battle between the corporate behemoth and the hedge fund.\n\nAT&T is working with Goldman Sachs bankers, among others, to mount a defense against a potential proxy fight.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be much management change until there\u2019s blood in the street,\u201d said an investor familiar with AT&T\u2019s leadership.\n\nThe Time Warner building in New York City.

Regulators thwarted a 2011 attempt to buy wireless rival T-Mobile USA Inc. In search of growth and cash flow to sustain AT&T\u2019s needs, including what is now a nearly $15 billion annual dividend, Mr. Stephenson looked to entertainment.\n\nHe closed the purchase of DirecTV in 2015, which turned out to be near the peak of the pay-TV market. There was internal disagreement over prospects of the newly enlarged business, which had amassed 26 million U.S. subscribers. A board-level presentation in early 2014 warned that the number of pay-TV households were \u201clikely at their peak and expected to decline.\u201d\n\nStacking Up How AT&T and its subsidiaries fare versus rivals in various sectors How AT&T and its subsidiaries fare versus rivals in various sectors Rival company AT&T Postpaid wireless connections, in millions* AT&T Verizon 76.3 113.9 Pay TV customers, in millions* AT&T Comcast 22.9 21.1 Premium cable/ streaming subscribers, in millions HBO\u2020 Netflix\u2021 140 151.6 Movie box office in billions** Warner Bros. Disney $5.5 $7.3\n\nAT&T\u2019s overall TV business has shrunk, and losses have accelerated. Analysts expect AT&T to end the year with fewer than 22 million paying TV customers in the U.S.\n\nElliott is seeking shareholder support to press AT&T to sell the DirecTV business, according to people familiar with the matter. Industry M&A experts said it would likely be valued at less than $25 billion, excluding debt, about half of what AT&T paid.\n\nIf it were put up for sale, there would be few interested buyers. AT&T finance chief John Stephens said Wednesday that a hookup between DirecTV and satellite rival Dish Network Corp. has been tried already. \u201cFrom a regulatory perspective,\u201d he said, \u201cit hasn\u2019t been successful.\u201d\n\nFormer executives say Messrs. Stephenson and Stankey also misjudged the demands of running a media business compared with a telecom business.\n\nAT&T has tried to impose a telephone-company culture on a creative company, a former Time Warner executive said.\n\nA WarnerMedia spokesman said top executives who left the company all departed for different reasons, and he cited a deep pool of writers, directors and other creative talent working for the media unit.\n\nMr. Stankey, along with his promotion to chief operating officer, remains CEO of WarnerMedia. He replaced the leaders of HBO, Turner and Warner Bros., seeking to break down fiefs and develop a single strategy. He brought in former NBC programming executive Robert Greenblatt and reduced a 600-person Time Warner corporate office to fewer than 100.\n\nElliott criticized AT&T for pushing out much of the leadership at DirecTV and Time Warner, a sentiment shared by some current and former executives. AT&T stalwarts disagree, saying key people continue to work at both units.\n\nThis week, Mr. Stankey secured a content partnership with Hollywood director and producer J.J. Abrams, who signed with WarnerMedia over other suitors including Apple, a person familiar with the deal said.\n\nMr. Stankey\u2019s biggest initiative, a streaming service that can compete with Netflix, as well as new offerings from Apple Inc. and Disney, has yet to launch.\n\nSoon after the Time Warner deal closed, Mr. Stankey detailed plans for a three-tiered streaming service with graduated pricing and varied content. He sought little input from top executives at Warner Bros. and HBO, blind-siding them with the announcement, people familiar with the process said.\n\nBy June, Mr. Stankey had to backtrack.The three-tier plan was confusing both to the industry and inside the company, and rivals were coming out with simple, single-priced offers. AT&T now plans one service, called HBO Max, which will include HBO shows and other Warner content, including \u201cFriends.\u201d It is expected to cost more than $15 a month, according to people familiar with the project.\n\nTop, Zendaya in a scene from the HBO show \u201cEuphoria.\u201d Reese Witherspoon, below, in HBO\u2019s \u201cBig Little Lies.\u201d Photo: HBO(2)\n\nInside the company, some executives have been confused by the shifting strategy on streaming. Strategy sessions for HBO Max in June were supposed to clarify the company\u2019s approach. Yet many who attended left with many questions unanswered on topics that spanned pricing to programming, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\n\u2014Lillian Rizzo and Joe Flint contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Drew FitzGerald at andrew.fitzgerald@wsj.com, Shalini Ramachandran at shalini.ramachandran@wsj.com and Corrie Driebusch at corrie.driebusch@wsj.com", "description": "Plans by CEO Randall Stephenson to leave the helm to a longtime ally triggered the threat of a proxy fight by an aggressive Wall Street activist investor.", "authors": ["Drew Fitzgerald", "Shalini Ramachandran", "Corrie Driebusch", "Andrew.Fitzgerald Wsj.Com", "Shalini.Ramachandran Wsj.Com", "Corrie.Driebusch Dowjones.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107065/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
