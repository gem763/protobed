However, that\u2019s far from the truth. A few situations are not in one\u2019s control, and bedroom faux pas are more common than you think. We tell you what could go wrong and how you could turn it into a lighter moment.\n\n\n\n\n\nNature\u2019s call\n\nThis is possibly your worst nightmare, and one that you think would gross him out. Fear not\u2014according to experts, this is normal. \u201cThe reason some women feel like urinating or unintentionally urinate just before or during orgasm, is that penetration can often put pressure on the bladder. During sex and orgasm, the bladder can contract, releasing urine at the same time,\u201d says Chennai-based sexologist Dr Santanam Jagannathan. She also states that sometimes women release fluid pools during orgasm, which could be confused with urine.\n\nWhat to do: Planning will come in handy. A simple solution would be vacating your bladder before sex so that you are not unsettled during the act. In case you feel an urge while you are at it, excuse yourself and use the loo. \u201cMost men are cool about it, even if you have to repeat the foreplay. Worst-case scenario: if you do end up peeing during sex, just shrug it off as a natural body phenomenon, clean up, and move on,\u201d says Jagannathan.\n\n\n\nGassy glitches\n\nStrange noises (not the ones that turn your significant other on) can catch you unawares; imagine letting out a belch while kissing or hearing his stomach growl almost comically in response to the sweet nothings you\u2019re whispering in his ears. Sounds like quite a scenario, doesn\u2019t it? \u201cMy boyfriend and I have odd hours at work, and we meet at odd hours as well, so there\u2019s a good chance one of us is ravenous, or full on a meal. This means that letting out some extra wind is definitely a possibility. We have both farted around each other, sometimes right in the middle of a very intense sexual moment. Our stomachs have also let out a tell-tale rumble, if hunger is getting in the way of our passion.,\u201d says Gargi Singh*, a 26-year-old freelance illustrator from Chennai.\n\nWhat to do: It might seem like a buzz kill in that moment, but it shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously. \u201cYes, it\u2019s embarrassing, but if your partner cares about you, it\u2019s not the end of the world. These are all bodily activities, and no one does it on purpose. Laugh about it, cuddle a bit, and you\u2019ll find it\u2019s perfectly okay,\u201d states Singh.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimal instinct\n\nThe million-dollar question that probably plagues pet owners across the world\u2013is it all right to have your dog watch while you have sex? Answers psychologist Manjula MK, \u201cExperts have concluded dogs and cats consider things like sex normal unlike human beings who think of it as a private act.\u201d However, the jury\u2019s still out on this. Your partner and you may feel extremely uncomfortable if you are being watched by your pet when you are in the throes of passion.\n\nWhat to do: First things first, if you feel so strongly about it, make sure your pet is safe and secure, and doesn\u2019t have access to your room\u2014so bolts in place, please! If your pet does happen to wander in, and it bothers you, swiftly carry it out, and keep it a confined space until you are done. \u201cOn the downside, the endorphins released during sex may send out signals to your dog that you\u2019re upset or angry, so you may want to be a bit watchful about how your pet reacts to it. If it seems disturbed, aggressive, withdrawn or its behaviour changes for the worse immediately after watching you and your partner in the act, ensure you don\u2019t repeat it and antagonise them. In this case, prevention is definitely better than cure,\u201d Manjula MK says.\n\n\n\nSafety first\n\nSometimes, in the middle of heated sex, the condom can slip off\u2013and if you\u2019re lucky, it\u2019s accessible and you can pull it out. However, if the penetration has been deep, and your partner\u2019s just pulled out with the condom missing, you are stuck in a tricky situation.\n\nWhat to do: Firstly, stay calm. If you work yourself up, your vaginal passage may contract, making it more difficult for you to yank out the condom. First try to remove it yourself by squatting on the floor, inserting a finger and taking it out gently and gradually. Don\u2019t use any pointed tools like tweezers as there is a possibility of you injuring yourself. If you\u2019re still unable to get the condom out seek professional help from a gynaecologist. \u201cWhile the condom itself is not a problem because you can seek professional help to remove it, the real issue is the fact that you\u2019ve put yourself at risk of STDs and unplanned pregnancies. So, to stay safe, get your partner and yourself tested to rule out any of these,\u201d Dr Jaggannathan advises.\n\n\n\n\n\nSex-perimenting\n\nIt\u2019s common for couples to try new positions to spruce things up in bed. Ever thought what if your attempt backfires? Says Kaveri K, a 35-year-old advertising professional, \u201cAfter having spend five years together, my husband and I find ourselves willing to experiment in the bedroom. But sometimes things can go wrong! For starters, once we were so focussed on getting it technically right, we were not turned on enough due to lack of foreplay and spontaneity. Owing to that the penetration just wasn\u2019t happening, since he\u2019s found it hard to get inside. And in this one instance, I ended up getting injured by pulling a muscle!\u201d\n\nWhat to do: No one is a gold-medal gymnast; perhaps it\u2019s time to cut yourself some slack on the flexibility front. \u201cGive a new position time and effort to ease into; don\u2019t expect to get it right initially, even straightforward sex takes time. Don\u2019t push your partner or be pushed into doing something that\u2019s beyond your physical capacity. Baby steps are fine. If you\u2019re unwilling to take time and effort because the spontaneity matters more, stick to positions that you know are reliable, and work for you,\u201d Kaveri opines.", "description": "A romp between the sheets is fun, but what if you encounter awkward bedroom situations during the act?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://femina.wwmindia.com/content/2019/aug/bedroomblooperssm1565329376.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-12"}
