While this was just one game, it represents the franchise's first victory in a postseason series since it was in Montreal in 1981.\n\nJuan Soto played the role of hero with a bases-loaded single off Josh Hader in the bottom of the eighth inning that scored three runs in part because right fielder Trent Grisham misplayed the ball and let it get past him.\n\nVideo Play Button McCollum and the Blazers Snapped Postseason Losing Streak for \"Jennifer\" Spencer Is the Real Winner of the Boston Marathon Stars Invest in Plant-Based Food as Vegetarianism Sweeps NBA The NBA Got Some Wild Techs This Season Jarrett Allen Is One of the NBA\u2019s Hottest Rim Protectors Wade's Jersey Swaps Created Epic Moments This Season NBA Squads Brought the Heat with Bench Reactions This Year Westbrook Makes History While Honoring Nipsey Hussle Nation\u2019s Top-Ranked H.S.

The typically dominant Hader was unable to close the door in Strasburg-like fashion, as Ryan Zimmerman's single and Anthony Rendon's ability to work a walk set the table for Soto.\n\nThings get more challenging from here for a Nationals team that used its two best pitchers for a combined eight innings before a series against a loaded Dodgers pitching staff, but the typical postseason futility was nowhere to be found in the final two innings.\n\nFamiliar Formula Finally Lets Down Resilient Brewers\n\nThe Brewers didn't have MVP candidate Christian Yelich after he suffered a fractured right knee cap last month. They didn't have an ace starter to match Scherzer. They are accustomed to being overlooked in their own division against high-profile opponents in the Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nNone of it mattered until Washington's final turn at bat.\n\nThe team that relied on a different hero every game when it went 13-5 and clinched a playoff spot after Yelich's injury turned to Brandon Woodruff as the starter who would deliver the ball to the formidable bullpen with the lead.\n\nVideo Play Button McCollum and the Blazers Snapped Postseason Losing Streak for \"Jennifer\" Spencer Is the Real Winner of the Boston Marathon Stars Invest in Plant-Based Food as Vegetarianism Sweeps NBA The NBA Got Some Wild Techs This Season Jarrett Allen Is One of the NBA\u2019s Hottest Rim Protectors Wade's Jersey Swaps Created Epic Moments This Season NBA Squads Brought the Heat with Bench Reactions This Year Westbrook Makes History While Honoring Nipsey Hussle Nation\u2019s Top-Ranked H.S.
