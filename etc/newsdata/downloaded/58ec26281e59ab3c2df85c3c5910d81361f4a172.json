Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, former Rep. Trey Gowdy, South Carolina Republican, and others. Mr. Gowdy recently joined the president\u2019s legal team fighting House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
