Carson King\u2019s good deed is being recognized as his community steps up.\n\nCarson King turned a silly stunt asking for donations to replenish his supply of Busch Light beer during a college football game into a huge windfall for University of Iowa\u2019s Stead Children\u2019s Hospital. While reporting on King\u2019s story, the Des Moines Register included two questionable tweets posted on his Twitter account when he was 16 years old. The fall-out from that piece included Anheuser-Busch withdrawing its support of King but pledging to honor its promise to match the money King raised for the hospital. When Busch Light said it would \u201chave no further association\u201d with King and went back on a promise of a year\u2019s supply of beer and King\u2019s face on the beer cans, another brewery stepped up.\n\nThe Head Brewer for Geneseo Brewing Company in Geneseo, Illinois posted a letter to King on Facebook that the action taken by Anheuser-Busch was \u201cappalling\u201d. He noted that King has shown a growing level of maturity since his teenage years.\n\nThat gave Glenn Cole, a brewer at Geneseo Brewing Company, an idea for his new beer. \u201cWhen you\u2019re alone in a brewery you kind of get thinking about things,\u201d Cole said. Cole couldn\u2019t stop thinking about King as he was getting ready to keg his latest brew. \u201cIt just kind of stuck with me all night,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just seemed like a really unfair deal of really demonizing somebody that was doing such a good thing.\u201d\n\nHelp us get this to Carson King.*He\u2019s contacted us. Thanks everyone!* Posted by Geneseo Brewing Co. on Wednesday, September 25, 2019\n\nThe beer will be called Iowa Legend and one dollar from the sale of each pint will go to the hospital. It\u2019s a Pilsner Zwicquell. The beer will be tapped Thursday, September 26 and the brewer is offering King some of the beer in appreciation of his good deed.\n\nThe attempt by a newspaper reporter to play gotcha with a young adult while he was trying to raise money for a children\u2019s hospital turned into an angry backlash against the Des Moines Register and Anheuser-Busch. The newspaper alleges to have received death threats and has taken additional security precautions.\n\nKWWL reported that the Des Moines Police Department will have presence outside of the Register\u2019s office \u201caround the clock\u201d and that the management has hired an off-duty police officer to secure inside the building. \u201cWe are certainly aware of some of the threats they\u2019ve had. They made a report to the police department so that goes on our radar as a place we are going to want to give a little extra attention to,\u201d Des Moines Police Sergeant Paul Parizek said to KWWL.\n\nThe community has rallied around King.\n\nThe beer giant said it would \u201chave no further association\u201d with King, but other companies announced new ways to donate tens of thousands of dollars to the University of Iowa Stead Family Children\u2019s Hospital. In addition, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds on Wednesday signed a proclamation declaring Sept. 28 \u201cCarson King Day.\u201d It\u2019s the day King is scheduled to attend a University of Iowa home game and participate in the \u201cHawkeye Wave\u201d to patients at the children\u2019s hospital. Make-A-Wish Iowa, a nonprofit organization that supports children with illnesses, thanked King on Facebook for his donation to the hospital, posting the hashtag #StandWithCarson. Goldie\u2019s Ice Cream Shoppe in Prairie City, where King grew up, originally intended to make a Busch Light-flavored ice cream. It said Wednesday that it would instead make a soft-serve using donated beer from Gezellig Brewing Co. in Newton. All proceeds will go to the fundraiser. Smokey Row Coffee Co., which has four locations, including one in Des Moines, said it would donate half of the price of each pumpkin spice latte sold until Sept. 30. DeWit Construction, where King\u2019s brother works, will honor its commitment to donate $300 for each new roof it lays between now and the fundraiser\u2019s end.\n\nKing is still graciously taking the high road.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just happy that Busch and Venmo are both still contributing and we can continue to raise funds for families and kids at the hospital,\u201d King said in a text message to the Des Moines Register. He declined to comment further, instead pointing to statements he made Tuesday night.", "description": "\"We have witnessed your growth...\"", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/574ca66b-8e39-4ce8-a4a9-ac6d3374af67.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
