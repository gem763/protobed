That is something that we\u2019ll continue to discuss that may or may not be part of whatever we ultimately decide.\u201d\n\nThe reason some owners proposed expanding the regular season is to cut the unpopular preseason from its current four-game slate. Preseason games are oft-criticized for the poor quality of play with starting players generally playing little.\n\nBut NFL owners are reluctant to cut down the number of preseason games without a vehicle to make up the lost revenue. Many teams include their two home preseason games as a mandatory aspect of season ticket packages.\n\nIf the league gets the 17-game regular season they\u2019re proposing, Goodell said it wouldn\u2019t force the league to start the season earlier.\n\n\u201cWe would still start the week after Labor Day, so we would have the same starting week but would just play one week longer (in February),\u201d Goodell said.\n\nThe compromise of 17 was suggested by Green Bay Packers President Mark Murphy, a former NFL player. If Murphy\u2019s proposal comes to fruition, the preseason would be cut to either two or three games.\n\nBut a big question yet to be answered about a potential 17-game season is how the schedule would work. Currently, with their 16-game regular season, NFL teams play eight home and eight road games.\n\nSo how can you schedule a 17-game regular season without creating a competitive disadvantage to the team\u2019s forced to play an extra road game?\n\nOne proposal involved making the the extra game an international contest for each team with the NFL\u2019s popularity growing overseas, especially in Great Britain. The NFL scheduled four games in London this season, and all of them sold out. NFL football is also popular in places like Canada, Mexico and Germany.\n\nSo there are some logistical details to be ironed out on how a 17-game season would look, but it certainly looks like an 18-game regular season is a nonstarter with the player\u2019s union.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see an 18-game schedule\u2014under any circumstance\u2014being in the best interest of our players,\u201d NFLPA Chief DeMaurice Smith told ESPN\u2019s Cameron Wolfe in July. \u201cIf somebody wants to make an 18-game proposal, we\u2019ll look at it. I haven\u2019t seen anything that makes me think that it would be good for the players.\u201d\n\nWhile more regular season games would lead to more money for players, the union boss is concerned with how more football games would impact the health of his rank-and-file.\n\n\u201cFor us, it comes down to who players are as men, and is it good for us,\u201d Smith told Wolfe. \u201cIf a coal miner is willing to spend more time in the hole, does it likely result in more money? Yeah. Is that a good thing for him as a person? Probably not. That\u2019s the question nobody confronts. It\u2019s easy to say it\u2019s more money. But is it good for us? The answer is no.\u201d", "description": "It's no secret that some NFL owners would like to expand the regular season from 16 to 18 games, but they might have have to settle for 17.", "authors": ["Daniel Leberfeld"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/ap3-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
