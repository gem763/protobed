And fittingly, she married a man who has had his own journey in a bid to resemble Ken.\n\nLos Angeles-based mom-of-one Marcela said her obsession began when her own mom refused to buy her a Barbie when she was growing up in Buenos Aires, Argentina, ironically only furthering her obsession with the toy's aesthetics.\n\nTransformation: After being forbidden from having a Barbie growing up, Marcela Inglesias, pictured, was even more inspired to transform into a human version of the doll\n\nLife's plastic, it's fantastic: Marcela is pictured with husband of 10 years Steven Berman, whom she says 'loves her look' and has been 'part of the transformation' with his own surgeries\n\nSurrounded by friends who owned Barbie dolls, Marcela became obsessed with the goal of transforming herself into a human Barbie and before she hit puberty, she would stuff her bra and her bum to create the curves of the doll.\n\nOnce she hit puberty, her body shape changed and she developed a curvy figure naturally, which helped with her dream of turning into the human doll she craved.\n\nWhen she was just 14-years-old, she ditched her naturally brunette hair in favor of becoming blond.\n\nMarcela began buying more clothes that matched the look and despite feeling tempted to have procedures to accentuate her figure even more, she was always afraid of going under the knife.\n\nAfraid: The mom-of-one is regularly called 'plastic', but she insists she has never had plastic surgery to achieve her look\n\nThen and now: Growing up as a teen in Argentina, left, Marcela became obsessed with channeling her idol Barbie and began the transformation to her current look, right\n\nAnd all in less than an hour: Marcela said it takes her 40 minutes to turn into Barbie using wigs and makeup, pictured\n\nHer hourglass figure has prompted many comments from strangers who have accused her of being 'plastic' and 'fake', but Marcela insists that all she has dabbled with are a Spider Webb bum lift, Botox and lip fillers.\n\nA Spider Webb bum lift involves 100 injections into the buttocks, a process which Marcela previously shared with the media.)\n\nInstead, her look is made up of contact lenses, wigs, makeup and a variety of Barbie-inspired outfits. And her physique, she insists, is a result of working hard at the gym.\n\n'My obsession with Barbie started from a very young age; I always loved how the doll looked and the glamorous appearance she has,' Marcela said.\n\nChildhood: Marcela's mom, pictured with her left and right, refused to buy her a Barbie doll growing up\n\nTeenager: Marcela started her transformation into Barbie, right, even before puberty, left, as she began stuffing her bra and butt to look more curvy\n\nShe met her now-husband of ten years, Steven, and decided to move to California with him, where they had a child.\n\nWhile living in Los Angeles - where plastic surgery is infamously common - she toyed with the idea of having some work done.\n\n'I always thought of the possibility of breast implants but for some reason after over twenty consultations I still have hesitations about them. So, I put that idea aside.'\n\nShe added, 'Living in Hollywood helps a lot because there's a lot of stuff that I can buy to look more like the doll; I achieve my look with contact lenses, wigs, make up and outfits.\n\n'Lots of people accuse me of looking fake but if you know me in person, you'll totally see that my beauty is natural and yes I usually create the look with make-up but that doesn't mean that I am a plastic person,' she said.\n\nAccepted: Marcela lives in California, and she said people in Hollywood are very receptive to her look\n\nPartner: Marcella married her husband Steven, pictured, 10 years ago\n\nSteven not only 'loves' her look, he has also been part of the journey himself.\n\nOver the course of three years, he himself has undergone procedures such as a platysmaplasty (a neck lift), a chin implant, Botox, fillers and a PDO Thread Lift (which lifts sagging skin).\n\nSurgery: The blond revealed that Steven, pictured, has had surgeries including a neck lift and a chin implant\n\n'He looks like a Ken doll. He was part of my transformation and he loves it,' she said.\n\nMarcela revealed that most people she encounters are fans of her look.\n\n'I go out looking like a Barbie or a human doll and usually the people love it and they can sometimes be surprised by someone that looks completely different and I like the attention, it's always positive in my opinion,' she said.\n\n'I admire what the doll represents more than how she looks; I am very respectful of the image of the Barbie doll as I want to encourage all men and women around the world to pursue their dreams and to achieve the look they want.\n\n'But I always say that surgery should be considered the last choice; I want to be perceived as a very strong woman that knows what she wants rather than a 'bimbo'.\n\n'Barbie is an inspiration to be whatever you want to be. You control your own destiny.\n\n'Believe it or not it takes me 40 minutes to create my look. I know exactly what I am doing. I usually prepare my outfits in advance especially when I have to do my YouTube segment.\n\n'Men, women and kids in particular love my Barbie look; they stare and usually my outfits attract attention as well.\n\nBarbie Dream House: The Argentina-born real estate investor pictured at home with her dogs in California\n\nContacts: Marcela, who has 172,000 followers on Instagram where she shares her Barbie-inspired transformations, often uses colored contact for effect", "description": "Marcela Iglesias is often called 'fake' and 'plastic', but the Argentina-born, Los Angeles-based mom-of-one said she has never gone under the knife to achieve her human Barbie look.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/18/19453704-0-image-a-115_1570555646155.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
