So if it's damaged by straighteners or products you can't \"heal\" it with leave-in treatments,' he said.\n\n'Those treatments will give it the appearance of shine immediately after but won't be long-lasting.'\n\nIn a latter part of the video Brad explained that the old wives tale about lemon juice lightening your hair is true because its acidity reacts to the sun's heat.\n\nHowever, it is more likely going to turn your hair orange over a golden tone so it's best to trust the professionals with your highlights.\n\nHe went on to say that rinsing your hair with cold water doesn't make it any shinier, grey hair is down to genetics rather than stress and colour doesn't 'attach' better to hair if its dirtier.", "description": "A New York based hairdresser has challenged some of the long-held hair myths believed by many, including whether cutting your split ends will help hair grow faster.", "authors": ["Matilda Rudd For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/06/20020616-0-image-a-11_1571721198521.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
