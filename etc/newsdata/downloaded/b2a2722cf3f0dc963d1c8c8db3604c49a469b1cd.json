We want to be in control of how this happens. We don't want this to fall on its own and cause damage to this critical infrastructure,\" said New Orleans Fire Chief Tim McConnell.\n\nStorm on the way: Disturbance in Gulf likely to develop into tropical storm\n\nCrews began working Thursday to place small explosive charges at certain points on the crane. On Friday, firefighters will knock on doors and expand the evacuation zone before the proverbial fuse is lit on a dangerous but necessary operation.\n\nTwo unstable cranes loom over the New Orleans Hard Rock Hotel, which collapsed last Saturday, killing three workers. Authorities say explosives will be strategically placed on the cranes in hopes of bringing them down with a series of small, controlled blasts ahead of approaching tropical weather. More\n\n\"We have concerns about how the weather may impact the operation here and the stability of the two cranes,\" said Gov. John Bel Edwards, who was visiting the site Thursday. \"So we are working as hard as we can on a timeline to have those two towers taken down safely before the winds would be able to cause those cranes potentially to fall and do more damage.\"\n\nThe cranes are moving, and 'they're not designed to do that'\n\nThe collapse killed three people, two of whom authorities have been unable to remove from the rubble.\n\nIn the days since the collapse, the damaged cranes have shown concerning amounts of movement. A day after the rear crane tower moved 1 inch, it moved 4 inches overnight Wednesday.\n\nHard Rock Hotel collapse: 9/11 engineers brought in, search and rescue ongoing\n\n\"They're not designed to do that,\" McConnell said.\n\nAt the top of the crane towers is a 145,000-pound cross beam. Small explosives placed at the supports are hoped to allow the cross beam to fold downward on either side, and explosives up and down the tower itself will break it down while keeping it within the construction site. Parts of the cranes are also being manually cut.\n\nThis aerial photo shows the Hard Rock Hotel in New Orleans, which was under construction, after a fatal partial collapse Oct. 12, 2019. More\n\n\"Small explosives will damage the crane in a very methodical way to bring it down in an exact location is the goal. Obviously, something like this is not an exact science. You can't practice this,\" McConnell said.\n\nThe storm might miss New Orleans, but there are other challenges\n\nThe good news for New Orleans is the tropical system aiming for the Gulf Coast is not expected to have much impact on the city, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Michael Hill. Although there's a 90% chance it could develop into a tropical depression or tropical storm, current models have the storm glancing eastward toward Pensacola, Florida.\n\nQuestions linger: What we don't know about the Hard Rock Hotel collapse\n\nBetween Friday evening and Saturday morning, New Orleans may see winds as high as 20-30 mph and less than 1 inch of rain.\n\n\"Right now we\u2019re on a favorable track,\" Hill said. \"This should be a minor event and mostly miss us.\"\n\nNew Orleans Mayor Latoya Cantrell and Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards address reporters near the Hard Rock Hotel Oct. 17, 2019, in New Orleans. The 18-story hotel project that was under construction collapsed last Saturday, killing three workers. Two bodies remain in the wreckage.
