Thus far, the firm has invested about $2.1 billion, according to its website. \u2026 With the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014, Joe Biden became point person in Ukraine as well. That same year, Hunter Biden landed a board position with the Ukrainian energy giant Burisma Holdings. Despite having no background in energy or Ukraine, the vice president\u2019s son was paid as much as $50,000 a month, according to financial records. (He left the board in early 2019). \u2026 The Bidens are hardly alone. President Trump\u2019s transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, and her husband, Senator Mitch McConnell, are being accused of having profited from their commercial ties to Beijing. In 2004, the two had a net worth of about $3.1 million, according to public disclosures. Three years later, the range was $3.1 million to $12.7 million. The next year, their net worth rocketed to $7.3 million to $33.1 million.\n\n\u201cLast month, the House Oversight and Reform Committee started an investigation into whether Secretary Chao has leveraged her government positions to benefit her family. But so far there is no investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden,\u201d Schweizer wrote. \u201cDefenders claim there must first be proof that a law was broken to open an investigation. That\u2019s exactly backward. Congress can and should conduct an inquiry to determine whether anything illegal occurred.\u201d\n\nThe bestselling author called for a \u201cWashington Corrupt Practices Act,\u201d which he says would create a legal standard that \u201cclearly shuts down foreign influence and self-enrichment for some of America\u2019s most powerful families on both sides of the aisle.\u201d\n\nPeter Schweizer\u2019s Secret Empires was first in-depth investigative work to uncover the details behind how Hunter Biden received millions of dollars from Burisma Holdings while his father, then-Vice President Biden, steered $1.8 billion in aid money to Ukraine.\n\nJerome Hudson is Breitbart News Entertainment Editor and author of the bestselling book 50 Things They Don\u2019t Want You to Know.
