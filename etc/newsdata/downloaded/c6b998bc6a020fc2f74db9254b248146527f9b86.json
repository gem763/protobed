Tampon String. Photo: Getty Images\n\nSometimes, your tampon string makes a run for it. You feel a little tickle creeping down your upper thigh and realize this bird just won\u2019t be caged. Well, you could try to clip her wings, but I think anyone who read Seventeen\u2019s Embarrassing Moments column will remember what happens when you try to keep a rogue tampon string down. (Your crush, mistaking the string for an errant thread on your jean skirt and wanting to keep your hemline pristine, will grab it and, to the horror of all, tug hard.) That story is haunting, and personally I am ready for a new and less stressful narrative.\n\nLike, for example, this recent performance from Charli XCX in Austin, Texas: In a Friday Instagram post, the British singer invited her followers to revisit the moment when her \u201ctampon string stole the show.\u201d In the video, Charli stops, does a behind-the-back reach down to her undercarriage and informs the crowd: \u201cOh, my tampon string is out tonight.\u201d Calm, cool, collected, and bowled over by this tampon string\u2019s \u201ciconic\u201d \u201cstage presence,\u201d per the caption.\n\nCharli XCX ft. Tampon String, we should be so lucky.\n\nStay in touch.
