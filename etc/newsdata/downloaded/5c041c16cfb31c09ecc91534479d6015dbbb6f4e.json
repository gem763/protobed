[Oct 9, 2019]", "language": "en", "text": "YOU NAILED IT!\n\nDonna: I\u2019m so proud of you. You nailed it! You absolutely nailed it.\n\nDan: Thanks for supporting me.\n\nDonna: I did nothing. It was you who did all the talking, and you were brilliant.\n\nDan: I sure hope so. Let\u2019s not count our chickens before they\u2019re hatched. Nothing is certain yet. Janet Wu from 5H and Tommy Chan from 6B haven\u2019t pitched their proposals, and they\u2019ve got excellent ideas too\n\nDonna: Well, neither of them are as organised and professional as you are.\n\nDan: Who knows? They might have better ideas for the school magazine too. I hope Mrs Lam makes her mind up about the next editor soon. The school magazine is quite old-fashioned at the moment and is behind on all the latest news and trends. It needs to be brought up to date. Also, we need to have an online magazine.\n\nDonna: I think Mrs Lam agreed with you when you talked about how you\u2019d like to revamp the magazine. I noticed how she actually smiled and nodded her head. And when did Mrs Lam last smile? A hundred years ago?\n\nDan: Ha ha! I know, right! She\u2019s infamous for that poker face of hers. You can never tell if she is happy or upset about something.\n\nDonna: That\u2019s true. I hope Mrs Lam didn\u2019t think I was stupid because I didn\u2019t say anything.\n\nDan: Of course she didn\u2019t. And besides, each candidate was\n\nallowed to take one person into the interview with them.\n\nBesides, I\u2019ve put down in the application form that you would be my deputy editor if I\u2019m selected for the position. It\u2019s both of us or nothing.\n\nDonna: Awww \u2026 this means a lot to me. Thank you!\n\nDan: I also included in the form that both of us want to study creative writing or journalism in university. Speaking of which, Mrs Lam might want to have look at our portfolio though. How many of your poems have been published in the magazine so far?\n\nDonna: About five, I think. A few of my film reviews were also published in the magazine.\n\nDan: So, together we make a strong team to take the school magazine forward. I know that Mrs Lam and the other members of the teaching staff think the magazine is an important part of the school\u2019s culture.\n\nDonna: But its readership has been dropping, and a drastic makeover is needed if the magazine is to survive. It\u2019s no use producing something that students find boring. And you definitely got your point across to Mrs Lam very well.\n\nDan: Thanks. Now all we can do is wait for her to make a decision.\n\nDonna: So, good luck to both of us. Let\u2019s hope we don\u2019t have to wait too long.\n\nDan: Yes. Fingers crossed!\n\nEND", "description": "Together we make a strong team!", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/shutterstock1481852078script.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
