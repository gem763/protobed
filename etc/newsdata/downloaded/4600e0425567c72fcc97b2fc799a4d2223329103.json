A similar issue cropped up for Pixel 3 users in the past, but that was a much rarer bug and seemingly only affected photos taken in Night mode. The Pixel 4 white balance errors, on the other hand, happen when shooting in any of the Google camera app\u2019s various camera modes, and even when using alternative apps.\n\nThat\u2019s right: not even changing to a different app will fix the white balance problem since the issue is caused by OS-level software rather than the camera hardware or the apps themselves. While this means Google could ostensibly solve the odd behaviour via future Android updates, there\u2019s been no indication of one coming any time soon despite the user complaints.\n\nRight: the original RAW photo.

(Photo: User naldorodriguez, Reddit)\n\nHowever, Reddit users have discovered a potential fix for salvaging photos affected by the Pixel 4's white balance miscalculations.\n\nIt appears that by exporting the RAW photo file\u2014which is essentially the untouched image data that your camera creates when you snap a picture\u2014then converting it to a different file type you can circumvent the Pixel\u2019s white balance correction which may result in more accurate colour data. Some users report the RAW images are grainier and lack sharpness, which makes sense and since they haven\u2019t gone through of the Pixel 4's various post-processing punch ups, but this is the only real solution for now.\n\nHow to export and convert RAW photos saved on Pixel 4\n\nIn order to export the RAW photos from your Pixel 4 or 4 XL (or any other Pixel device, for that matter), you first need to enable RAW shooting in the stock Pixel camera app.\n\nOpen the app, slide to the far right of the centre menu and tap \u201cMore\u201d > \u201cAdvanced.\u201d Scroll down and enable \u201cRAW+JPEG control.\u201d Tap \u201cView RAW folder\u201d to see all the RAW files saved on your phone. While you can view RAW photos this way, you\u2019ll need to open them in a photo editing app like Google\u2019s Snapseed that supports RAW photos, then export them into a more web- or sharing-friendly format such as JPEG\u2014which is probably the best choice for posting on social media or attaching them in texts or email.\n\nYou can also convert RAW files to other photo formats on PC. You\u2019ll need to transfer the files from your phone to your PC either via USB or by using a cloud drive service, then edit/export them using software like Photoshop, Lightroom, or one of these free and open-source alternatives.", "description": "The Pixel 4 and 4 XL\u2019s have some of the best camera hardware available on any smartphone, but \u201cbest\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily mean \u201cperfect.\u201d As Android Police, Reddit posters, and Google support users have reported, the Pixel 4's white balance algorithm seems to cause a strange colour-correction error.
