I don't use it as a weapon. It just makes me feel better. And I'm sorry if I hurt anybody,\" Chappelle said, before adding, \"Yada, yada, 'everything I'm supposed to say,'\" and sticking out his tongue.\n\n\"I think it's gone way too far,\" comedian Marlon Wayans said. \"I mean, if there's gonna be political correctness, the person that needs to be corrected the most is the president,\" the \"Scary Movie\" star said.\n\nAs a comic, Wayans said, he talks \"about the crazy stuff that goes on.\"\n\n\"I don't care what the topic is, my job is a hard one. I got to find what's funny about these dark topics that people are afraid to talk about,\" Wayans said.\n\nRep. Joyce Beatty Joyce Birdson BeattyStars turn out as Chappelle receives Mark Twain Prize Live coverage: Zuckerberg testifies before House on Facebook's Libra project The 13 House Democrats who back Kavanaugh's impeachment MORE (D-Ohio) said the eclectic mix of comedians, musicians, and TV personalities lauding Chappelle, which included John Legend, Jon Stewart, Morgan Freeman, Sarah Silverman, Bradley Cooper and Lorne Michaels, among others, proved that there was \"still hope.\"\n\n\"There's still the benefit of people coming together. The diversity that you will see here tonight will be reflective of the great democracy that we live in. Maybe it'll send a message to the president,\" Beatty said.\n\nDespite the celebratory nature of the ceremony, which included a marching band and Freeman as the evening's official announcer, politics was never too far from the event.\n\nAt one point during the televised festivities, Freeman bellowed over the sound system: \"Just a reminder that my voice is available for weddings, bar mitzvahs and impeachment hearings.\"\n\nAfter appearing onstage to applause, former \"Daily Show\" host Stewart cracked to the audience.\n\n\"I'm in Washington tonight and I see the love, and the joy, and the laughter in this room \u2014 and I can't help but wonder, is this what shit was like down here when Obama was president?\" he asked.\n\n\"There was laughter and joy,\" Stewart said. \"Now you all just walk around like, 'Go f--- yourself.'\"\n\nChappelle, as he accepted the Mark Twain Prize, said only in the United States could one find comics representing nearly every viewpoint: \"Standup comedy is an incredibly American genre. I don't think any other country could produce this many comedians.\"\n\n\"Each and every one of you has a champion in the room,\" Chappelle, 46, told the crowd.\n\n\"We watch you guys fight, but when we're together, we talk it out,\" the boundary-pushing Emmy Award winner said of his colleagues.\n\n\"The First Amendment is first for a reason. The Second Amendment is just in case the first one doesn't work out,\" Chappelle quipped.\n\n\"We got to let some air out of the ball, man,\" Chappelle said. \"The country's getting a little tight. It doesn't feel like it's ever felt in my lifetime. So tonight I am honored that my colleagues are here in comedy and in music.\"\n\n\"I love this job,\" Chappelle said. \"It saved my life.\"\n\nThe 22nd annual Mark Twain Prize airs on PBS stations on Jan. 7.", "description": "Stars came equipped with their best one-liners \u2014 and opened up about comedy in the Trump era \u2014 as they celebrated Dave Chappelle, the recipient of this year's prestigious Mark Twain Prize.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/chappelledave1_102719traceysalazar.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
