Like every recent iPhone, they also run on new processors \u2013 this year\u2019s version is called the A13 Bionic chip.\n\nThe new entry-level iPhone is also slightly cheaper this year compared to the 2018 model. The iPhone 11 starts at $700, whereas last year\u2019s iPhone XR began at $750. If you opt for one of the Pro models, you\u2019ll be spending at least $1,000 for the iPhone 11 Pro or $1,100 for the larger iPhone 11 Pro Max.\n\nRead more: After spending two full days with Apple\u2019s new iPhones, I\u2019m convinced that the iPhone 11 is the best choice for most people \u2013 here\u2019s why\n\nI\u2019ve been using all three phones over the past several days, and here\u2019s a look at the pros and cons I\u2019ve discovered so far.\n\nPro: Both the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro offer long battery life.\n\nsource Crystal Cox/Business Insider\n\nApple\u2019s new iPhones have more than enough power to comfortably get you through a day and then some on a single charge.\n\nI used the iPhone 11 Pro for a full day and a half and still had 15% of my battery left. That\u2019s after I cranked up the display brightness to its maximum for about two hours, which usually drains the battery much more quickly.\n\nThe iPhone 11 is also impressive; by the end of the workday I still had 71% of my battery left, indicating that I\u2019d have more than enough juice to get me through a significant chunk of the next day.\n\nCon: The \u2018notch\u2019 is still as noticeable as ever.\n\nsource Crystal Cox/Business Insider\n\nWhile other smartphone makers like Samsung have done more to make the \u201cnotch\u201d cutout that houses the camera and facial-recognition sensors less noticeable, the iPhone\u2019s is still as evident as ever.\n\nThat makes Apple\u2019s new iPhones look slightly less elegant than the Galaxy S10 and Note 10 lineup, which more convincingly create the illusion that the screen stretches from edge-to-edge thanks to Samsung\u2019s more subtle hole-punch-like cutout.\n\nHowever, Samsung\u2019s facial recognition is said to be less secure than Apple\u2019s, which could be more problematic.\n\nRead more: Apple\u2019s iPhone 11 Pro launch is proof that the smartphone industry is going through a massive change\n\nPro: They can also take crisp and clear photos in the dark \u2014 giving Google\u2019s Night Sight some serious competition.\n\nsource Crystal Cox/Business Insider\n\nIf you frequently find yourself struggling to get good photos in dark conditions \u2013 maybe inside a dim bar or restaurant \u2013 you\u2019ll appreciate the iPhone\u2019s new night mode. It automatically kicks in whenever your iPhone detects that you\u2019re in a low-light environment, so you don\u2019t have to remember to turn it on.\n\nIn my testing, I found that it took images that were sharper than those taken on the Google Pixel 3a XL and Samsung Galaxy S10 \u2013 both of which offered their own version of night mode long before Apple. The photo I took with the iPhone 11 Pro wasn\u2019t quite as bright as the one shot on the Google Pixel 3a XL, but it was a bit sharper and the subject was lit more evenly.\n\nTake a look at the photo samples in our full review.\n\nCon: The iPhone 11 also lacks a fingerprint scanner, meaning you must type in a passcode when not using Face ID.\n\nsource Crystal Cox/Business Insider\n\nIf your iPhone experience is anything like mine, Face ID doesn\u2019t always work. And even if it does work for you most of the time, you probably still find yourself typing in your passcode occasionally when unlocking your phone while wearing sunglasses, or when you simply don\u2019t feel like lifting it up to get an accurate view of your face.\n\nOther phone makers like Samsung, OnePlus, and Google also include fingerprint scanners on their devices as an alternative \u2013 some of which are embedded in the display, and others which are located on the back of the device.\n\nPro: The camera interface lets you see how your shot will look both in wide and ultra-wide mode before you take it.\n\nsource Crystal Cox/Business Insider\n\nApple is playing catch-up to device makers like Samsung by adding an ultra-wide angle lens to the iPhone. But Apple\u2019s software does have a useful touch that Samsung\u2019s lacks: the ability to see how your shot may look before you even switch to the ultra-wide-angle lens.\n\nOn the iPhone 11 or iPhone 11 Pro, you\u2019ll notice that the borders above and below the camera viewfinder where the shutter button and settings are located will gradually become transparent as you frame your shot. That allows you to use that space to see how much more of the scene you\u2019ll be able to capture if you switch to the ultra-wide-angle lens.\n\nCon: The iPhone 11 Pro is also heavier than last year\u2019s iPhone.\n\nsource Crystal Cox/Business Insider\n\nIf having a phone that feels very lightweight is a priority, you may want to consider that the iPhone 11 Pro is a bit heavy. It weighs 188 grams, which is heavier than the 177-gram iPhone XS and 157-gram Samsung Galaxy S10. I didn\u2019t find this to be a nuisance during my review \u2013 in fact, I actually preferred the iPhone 11 Pro\u2019s heft because it made the phone feel more premium and durable. But others may not share that sentiment.\n\nPro: The iPhone 11 Pro\u2019s matte-glass back gives the phone a polished and durable feel.\n\nOne of the biggest physical changes between this year\u2019s iPhone 11 Pro and last year\u2019s iPhone XS is its textured matte-glass back. If you plan on using a case most of the time, this may not matter all that much.\n\nBut if not, you\u2019ll notice that the matte finish gives the glass a slightly cloudier look and makes it less prone to fingerprint smudges. It also doesn\u2019t feel as slick as the glossy glass that covers the back of the iPhone XS, which could make it easier to hold without dropping if you\u2019re not using a case.\n\nBut only time will tell how durable and scratch-resistant this matte glass will be after prolonged usage.\n\nPro: The iPhone 11 Pro finally comes with a bigger charger that can power your phone faster.\n\nsource Crystal Cox/Business Insider\n\nApple\u2019s pricier iPhones now come with an 18-watt charger that can give your iPhone up to a 50% charge in about 30 minutes. The company is finally including a bigger, faster charger in the box after other rivals have offered fast-charging for years. The bigger charger that comes with the Pro also includes a USB-C to Lightning cable, meaning you can plug it directly into your MacBook to charge it or transfer data without an adapter if you\u2019re using a newer model.\n\nCon: The iPhone 11 doesn\u2019t.\n\nsource Lisa Eadicicco/Business Insider\n\nApple may have finally given Pro owners a bigger charger than can power up their iPhone faster, but those who buy the iPhone 11 are still stuck with the same 5-watt charger Apple has bundled with its smartphones for years. If you want to use the larger 18-watt charger with your iPhone 11, you\u2019ll have to purchase the adapter from Apple for $30.", "description": "Business Insider - Apple's iPhone 11 and 11 Pro were released on September 20.
