He didn\u2019t disappoint Thursday as he managed to squeeze in some some playful jabs that will surely catch the attention of fans of his most recent employer, the Chicago Cubs.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nNew Angels manager Joe Maddon couldn't help but needle the Cubs during his introductory press conference.

That undoubtedly earned him a lifetime of respect and admiration from some Cubs fans.\n\nOf course, not all of them feel that way. Others were quick to sour on Maddon when his final three seasons didn\u2019t lead to another World Series title despite Chicago having a top-notch roster. Those fans might not appreciate the mere suggestion that Maddon would enjoy taking down a team that some feel he\u2019s already helped destroy to some degree.\n\nCould a Cubs-Angels World Series actually happen?\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chances of that dream matchup happening would seem to be a long shot. At least in the short term. Despite the presence of Mike Trout, the Angels have a long way to go to build a team that can compete with the American League\u2019s best. Los Angeles won just 72 games in 2019 and finished 35 games behind the Houston Astros.\n\nUnlike when Maddon walked into Chicago\u2019s clubhouse with a roster that was ready to compete, he\u2019ll have to help oversee the restructuring of a flawed roster. Maddon\u2019s deal runs for three seasons, so the turnaround will have to be quick if he hopes to hold up his end of the \u201cpipe dream.\u201d\n\nThe Cubs are at a crossroads too after mutually parting ways with Maddon on Sept. 29 and ultimately hiring David Ross, one of the heroes of the 2016 team, to be the team\u2019s new manager.\n\nRoss is walking into a clubhouse that needs a boost of energy and confidence. But the Cubs success over the next few seasons should ultimately fall on the front office led by Theo Epstein. Tough decisions will have to be made in order to get Chicago back in the World Series hunt.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Joe Maddon's goal as Angels manager: Beat the Cubs in the World Series.", "authors": ["Mark Townsend"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/45tsvtpAkVHPYq4ziWYXwA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04OTY-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xp_mPHFiAqyXbJx9zd3.Bg--~B/aD0yMTAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/5ad89090-f6b0-11e9-bff7-e339eb2aa322", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
