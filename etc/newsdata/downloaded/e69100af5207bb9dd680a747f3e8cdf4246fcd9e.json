She was ultimately among more than 30 underage girls identified as victims of Epstein during a wide-ranging investigation by the FBI and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Miami.\n\n(MORE: The rise and fall of Jeffrey Epstein: A timeline of the financier's troubles)\n\nIn 2008, under the pseudonym \u201cJane Doe 1,\u201d Wild sued the Justice Department in an effort to vindicate her rights as a crime victim. She alleged that the Epstein agreement was illegal because prosecutors failed to confer with her and the dozens of other alleged victims in advance of striking the deal, as required under the federal Crime Victims\u2019 Rights Act.\n\n\u201cI have been re-victimized, at every stage, by the same government that\u2019s supposed to protect me,\u201d Wild, 31, wrote in the letter to Barr.\n\nEpstein served just 13 months in a private wing of a Palm Beach County Jail and was granted liberal work releases privileges that allowed him to spend up to 16 hours a day at his office.\n\nEven after Epstein served his sentence and moved his primary residence to a private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Wild continued to press her case against the federal government over Epstein\u2019s indulgent deal.\n\nAfter 11 years of highly-contested litigation, which exposed the details of secret negotiations between prosecutors and Epstein\u2019s high-powered defense team, a federal judge ruled in February that the deal with Epstein was reached in violation of the rights of Wild and the other alleged victims.\n\nBut before the court could take the next step to decide whether to toss out the agreement, federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, on July 6, arrested Epstein for an alleged sex trafficking conspiracy. The new charges led to fresh scrutiny of Epstein\u2019s prior lenient treatment and to the resignation of the U.S. Secretary of Labor, R. Alexander Acosta, who presided over the non-prosecution agreement as the top federal prosecutor in Miami.\n\nPHOTO: Courtney Wild, one of Jeffrey Epstein's accusers who spoke at his bail hearing, attends a news conference outside federal court, in N.Y., July 15, 2019.

She traveled to New York for Epstein\u2019s detention hearing and urged a judge to keep Epstein locked up until his trial.\n\nLess than a month later, Epstein was dead from an apparent suicide in his federal prison cell.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, when Jeffrey Epstein died, the judge threw my case out,\u201d Wild wrote in her letter to Barr. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t make sense to me because the co-conspirators who received immunity through the illegal deal are still alive, as is the government who I sued for violating my rights in the first place. How is it fair that the government and Epstein\u2019s co-conspirators essentially get immunity by way of the government allowing Epstein to die in its custody?\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "Courtney Wild, who has accused sex offender Jeffrey Epstein of childhood abuse, is not giving up her fight for justice, even after Epstein\u2019s death by apparent suicide in August.
