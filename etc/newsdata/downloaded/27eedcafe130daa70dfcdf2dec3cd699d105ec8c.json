Instead, he lets his students drive the conversation on election issues such as misinformation.\n\n\"It's extremely important, I think, in teaching to take your students seriously, no matter what the age is,\" he said, in order to get them to open up and have a serious discussion. \"If you start at that base, and then we can talk about issues.\"\n\nCumbo's approach is resonating with his students.\n\n\"Politics can usually be seen as a sort of messy subject to talk about in casual conversation,\" said Denise San Juan, a student in Cumbo's class.\n\n\"Having these discussions in class and having an open-minded safe area to discuss these things without any judgment ... is a really good place to start.\"\n\nMock election\n\nThe National host Andrew Chang speaks to a group of students at Michael Power/St. Joseph High School about the federal election. (Turgut Yeter/CBC)\n\nWhile Cumbo's students won't legally be able to vote in the federal election, they're participating in a mock election being held across the country called Student Vote Canada 2019.\n\nStudent Vote is organized by CIVIX, a civic education charity, and runs parallel to the federal election.\n\nMore than 1 million elementary and secondary students at 9,500 schools across Canada are able to cast ballots in the mock federal election between Oct. 15 and 18.\n\nWATCH | The National's story about the student mock election, Friday night on CBC Television and streamed online\n\n\"The idea is to have them start to understand what it means to be a citizen and to participate as a citizen before they're of voting age,\" said Taylor Gunn, president of CIVIX.\n\nAside from Student Vote, CIVIX also provides classrooms with tools to help students get informed about politics before they cast their mock ballots.\n\n\"We have a special youth edition of Vote Compass made for students and teachers in classrooms,\" said Gunn.\n\nThe tool allows students to find out where they stand on the political spectrum, and what the key election issues are.\n\nIn addition, students can use a website called Pollenize to learn more about various party platforms and the promises made by the political parties.\n\nStudents at Michael Power/St. Joseph High School teach fellow classmates how to use online tools to learn more about various political parties in the run-up to the federal election. (Turgut Yeter/CBC)\n\nThis year's Student Vote is the sixth mock vote held in conjunction with a federal election.\n\n\"When we started, there could've been some teachers that maybe put [together] a class or two before their kids voted,\" said Gunn.\n\n\"Now it's regular for teachers to tell us how confident they are that their kids know more about the election and the issues and the candidates than their parents.\"\n\nVotes in the student mock election will be counted over the weekend and the results released on Student Vote's website when the federal election's official polls close Monday night.\n\n'I wish it could actually count'\n\nAngela Bilic, a student at Michael Power/St. Joseph High School, says that after preparing for the mock election in class, she wishes she could cast a vote that would count in the federal election. (Turgut Yeter/CBC)\n\nThe goal of getting young people interested in exercising their democratic rights at the polls seems to be working. Students participating in the mock vote at Michael Power/St. Joseph High School told CBC News that they're eager to cast ballots in the real Canadian federal election.\n\n\"[Voting] is empowering for sure \u2026 but knowing that it doesn't truly count is kind of a letdown for us,\" said Angela Bilic. \"I wish it could actually count, to let our voices be heard.\"\n\nThe Grade 12 student's enthusiasm about the electoral process is exactly what Cumbo wants to hear from his students.\n\n\"To me, what matters is that the school \u2026 becomes a bridge for these kids going out and understanding what it means to be a Canadian,\" Cumbo said.", "description": "Here\u2019s how a high school teacher and a civic education charity are getting students interested in politics, and preparing them to participate in Canada's electoral process.", "authors": ["Cbc Staff", "Alvin Yu Is A Consumer", "Business Reporter", "Winner Of An Rtdnf Canada Award.
