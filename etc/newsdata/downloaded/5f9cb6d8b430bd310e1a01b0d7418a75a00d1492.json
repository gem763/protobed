After a rough transcript showed the president suggestively talking about how good the United States is to Ukraine before asking Ukraine\u2019s president for investigations that carry political benefits for him, Republicans offered a muted response. A handful \u2014 most notably Sens. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), and even Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) to an extent \u2014 said the call was bad. But the vast majority of elected GOP officials stayed silent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe GOP\u2019s reward for that silence was that Trump basically took what he said on that unearthed July 25 call and said it out loud \u2014 this time about China. \u201c \u2026 China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\u201d Trump declared Thursday.\n\nSuddenly, the president \u2014 who in 2016 insisted that \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening\u201d was just a joke \u2014 was saying China, if you\u2019re listening with an unambiguous seriousness. China now becomes the third country he has requested politically helpful information from, with no end in sight as to how far he, his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and even Attorney General William P. Barr will take this.\n\nRomney weighed in again, via a statement and pair of Friday tweets, but he was also again lonely in his dissent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBy all appearances, the President\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling. \u2014 Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) October 4, 2019\n\nThe Republican Party\u2019s gamble on Trump has paid off thus far; that much we can say with plenty of certainty. Yes, they lost the House in 2018 and could well lose the presidency in 2020. But the former is pretty normal, and the latter is to be determined. In the meantime, they have filled two Supreme Court vacancies with conservative jurists, tipping the court 5 to 4 to their side, and stocked lower courts with a huge number of like-minded judges. They have gotten tax cuts passed and regulations rolled back. They have repealed Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate. They have gotten the U.S. Embassy moved to Jerusalem and withdrawals from the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal. None of these were hugely difficult with the GOP-controlled Congress that Trump inherited, and many of them were done unilaterally by Trump. But they would not have happened without him winning the presidency.\n\nWhere House members stand on impeaching Trump\n\nBut just because it has paid off thus far does not mean it always will. And the risk with Trump has always been less that he would lose reelection or be something of a middling failure as president, and more that his presidency would (a) inflict irreparable damage to American government/politics and or (b) be the kind of catastrophe that would define the GOP for years to come.\n\nThe latter has not happened yet, and it is too early to say that is coming down the pike. But it is getting more difficult to dismiss the possibility, as Trump continues to blatantly violate norms that Republicans once held sacred and feeds the impeachment inquiry that now promises to be the dominant story of his presidency, with plenty of disclosures apparently in the offing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile Trump has avoided tenure-defining crises like a new armed conflict or a poorly handled mass disaster, there are increasing signs that his China trade war could pull the economy in a downturn \u2014 with nobody quite certain how far he will continue to push the standoff with Beijing. As with Trump\u2019s request for foreign investigations, free-market Republicans do not seem to know what to say about a trade war that you just know they despise deep inside.\n\nAnd given Trump\u2019s unwieldiness and apparently, lack of carefulness, you never know when a scandal is suddenly going to become the scandal. Trump has inoculated himself against that by building a devoted base that has barely blinked at anything he has done, but everybody has a breaking point. The dam did not break on Richard Nixon, either ... until it did.\n\nThe threshold for tolerating Trump\u2019s various apostasies might be higher than it ever was for Nixon, given his base and given our current polarization. But at the least he is doing things that are putting Republicans in a very uncomfortable spot. And for what: Feeding unfounded conspiracy theories about a Democratic presidential candidate who finished fifth in the last presidential primary he ran in?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRepublicans have never really been able to stop Trump from being Trump, and they have often paid a price when they have tried. That is a big reason they do not really try anymore. They have been stung too many times when they thought this was their time to abandon ship. They might have even convinced themselves he knows something they do not about how all this works.\n\nBut there has to be a line somewhere. It may not be where the Amy Haskins\u2019s of the world wants it to be, but it is something the likes of Ernst and her colleagues should probably start thinking pretty hard about, given the events of the past two weeks.\n\nAD", "description": "The GOP has gotten plenty out of the Trump presidency, but what happens if Trump finally goes too far?", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9NmokVcL7FI6KgseGPZSBryiA5c=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-04-2019/t_bad97d1301a643eb8ca028b9a6732027_name_Clip0011_MXF_21_37_23_40_Still002.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
