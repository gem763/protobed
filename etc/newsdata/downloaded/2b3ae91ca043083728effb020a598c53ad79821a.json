It then rose to $1.2573 by midday London but sank to around $1.2471 just two hours afterwards.\n\nThe afternoon dip was fueled by a Financial Times report which suggested a continued stalemate over the Irish border situation. The \"Irish backstop\" has been a major sticking point in negotiations between the British government and the European Union.\n\nThe FT report said that U.K. Prime Minster Boris Johnson has told his colleagues that he doesn't expect to reach a full \"legally operable\" deal covering the border issue at a crucial EU leaders meeting on October 17-18.\n\nThis came as Britain's Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay was striking an optimistic tone shortly after meeting with the EU's top negotiator Michel Barnier.\n\n\"There is a shared desire reflected in the meeting today to secure a deal,\" Barclay told reporters, according to Reuters.\n\n\"There is a clear message from (European Commission) President Juncker and from the prime minister that a deal is doable,\" he said.\n\nThat failed to impress Ireland's deputy prime minister Simon Coveney, who told the BBC on Friday that he rejected any suggestion that preventing a hard Irish border could be sorted at a later date.\n\n\"We have a commitment from the British government over and over and over again \u2014 in writing and verbally \u2014 that they would work with us to put the issue and the anxiety around the Irish border question to rest now,\" Mr Coveney said.", "description": "The pound fell on Friday afternoon with a series of different Brexit developments causing traders to sell the British currency.", "authors": ["Matt Clinch"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106118077-1567937877598gettyimages-1149248996.jpg?v=1567937998", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
