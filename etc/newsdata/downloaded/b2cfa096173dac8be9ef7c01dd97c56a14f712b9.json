Ashes fourth Test: England player ratings 1/11 Rory Burns - 6/10 Offered another example of his admirable application with a first-innings 81, confirming his status as the most prolific opener in the series, only to bag a three-ball duck in the second. AFP/Getty Images 2/11 Joe Denly - 5 Shuffled back up to the top of the order and showed the right kind of resolve as England searched for a draw, holding out for 123 balls. Will be on duty at the Oval but at 33, for how much longer? AFP/Getty Images 3/11 Joe Root - 5 Made a battling 71 on day three then became the first England captain to make three ducks in a series when Pat Cummins bowled him with a snorter on the fourth evening. A second unsuccessful Ashes campaign as skipper. Getty Images 4/11 Jason Roy - 4 Swapped positions with Denly after a torrid time at opener, making 22 and 31. Still looks a long way from proving himself a Test batsman. PA 5/11 Ben Stokes - 4 A crash back to earth after his unforgettable outing at Headingley. Could not produce a third batting miracle of the summer and injured his right shoulder after an expensive stint with the ball. Getty Images 6/11 Jonny Bairstow - 4 Another disappointing return with the bat for a man whose tank might just be empty after a huge workload. Solid with the gloves. Action Images via Reuters 7/11 Jos Buttler - 7 Gave a good account of his battling qualities in each innings in what was easily his best game of the series. Needs a major score soon to silence doubts but this was a start. Getty Images 8/11 Craig Overton - 5 Selected to some surprise ahead of Chris Woakes and Sam Curran, the Somerset man's home debut was a mixed bag. His seamers were only a notch above functional but he dug down for nearly three hours in forlorn pursuit of a draw. AP 9/11 Jofra Archer - 4 Wicketless for the first time in his short Test career in the first innings and down on pace before his juices started flowing midway through the match. Still a huge talent but the quietest of his three outings to date. Action Images via Reuters 10/11 Stuart Broad - 7 Continued his playground bullying of David Warner, dismissing him twice for nought, and took his series wicket tally to 19 with five in the match. No blame attached here. Action Images via Reuters 11/11 Jack Leach - 5 Will forever rue the front-foot no-ball that cost England the best part of 100 runs from Steve Smith's bat, but plugged away and turned in another diligent tail-end defence.

Spinners will come more into the game and the pace bowlers will learn to adjust when there is no shine or hardness on the ball.\u201d\n\nWith a drawn Ashes series still achievable if England win the fifth Test at the Oval, Bayliss has shuffled his batting pack, dropping Jason Roy, with Sam Curran coming in for his first Test of the series after winning Player of the Series against India last year.\n\nChris Woakes also returns to the side in the place of Craig Overton, while Ben Stokes (ailed by a shoulder issue that will prevent him from bowling) plays as a specialist batsman \u2013 probably at number four in the batting order.\n\nStokes has had a fine summer, and Bayliss is not surprised by the all-rounder\u2019s development, particularly since the incident in Bristol in September 2017.\n\n\u201cHe had a confidence about him,\u201d Bayliss said of Stokes.\n\n\u201cHe obviously had a lot of skill but the way he went about his practice, you just knew he that wasn\u2019t going to take a backward step in any sort of contest, whether batting, bowling or in the field.\n\n\u201cFrom it, I think we have seen Ben, and a lot of the other guys, grow and mature as human beings. They are good people and that\u2019s what you want to see.\u201d", "description": "Trevor Bayliss has suggested that English batsmen should play on flatter wickets to improve their Test match returns.
