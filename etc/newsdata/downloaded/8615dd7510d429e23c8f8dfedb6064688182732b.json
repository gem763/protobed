Scarlett Wilson\n\nActress Scarlett Wilson is back in London after ten years in India starring in Bollywood. After a brief marriage over there she is single again.\n\nHer return hit a stumbling block in the summer when she unwittingly struck up a relationship with a conman. \u2018I was very lost in fake people,\u2019 Scarlett, 30, told me at the Groucho Club. \u2018I met this guy in Mayfair who wormed his way into my life and turned out to be a criminal. He would go into high-end places and tell them they\u2019d lost his credit card behind the bar. They were so embarrassed they believed him and he would buy the whole bar drinks with no credit card.\u2019\n\nScarlett would not identify him but I can report he is Medi Abalimba \u2013 who hit the headlines in April when he was dumped by Love Island\u2019s Georgia Steel after she found out that in 2014 he had been sentenced to four years for impersonating former Chelsea footballer Gael Kakuta to swindle people out of thousands of pounds.\n\nThings are looking up though \u2013 Scarlett is in new film The Last Faust and has been hanging with Gerard Butler. Good for her!\n\nActress Scarlett Wilson is back in London after ten years in India starring in Bollywood. After a brief marriage over there she is single again\n\nIt\u2019s early days for Ed Sheeran\u2019s Notting Hill pub Bertie Blossoms, but reviews so far could be better.\n\nThe singer likes a Guinness, so he\u2019ll no doubt be upset to hear that there was none available when my drinking buddy went to the Portobello Road hostelry hoping for a pint of the black stuff.\n\nAnother chum, who asked for white wine, was told she could only have it warm!\n\nTo be fair, the embarrassed bartender did offer both pals a different drink on the house, but maybe Ed needs to get down there sharpish if Bertie\u2019s really is to blossom\u2026", "description": "TALK OF THE TOWN: David Roper- Curzon has been told he owns only a tenth of Pylewell Park in Lymington, Hampshire, and needs to make room for his nine siblings.", "authors": ["Charlotte Griffiths For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/00/20229186-0-image-a-32_1572131754256.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
