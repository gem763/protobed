The card streams on ESPN+.\n\n(Click here to open a PDF of the staff picks grid in a separate window.)\n\nIn the main event, former welterweight and middleweight title challenger Demian Maia (27-9 MMA, 21-9 UFC) takes on former Bellator and ONE Championship titleholder Ben Askren (19-1 MMA, 1-1 UFC), who is coming off a 5-second knockout loss to Jorge Masvidal. The oddsmakers have made Askren a favorite of around -175, and our 13 MMA Junkie editors, writers, radio hosts and videographers are taking him at a fairly heavy 9-4 clip.\n\nIn the co-main event, Michael Johnson (19-14 MMA, 11-10 UFC) is more than a 3-1 favorite in his lightweight fight against Stevie Ray (22-9 MMA, 6-4 UFC), and he\u2019s the overwhelming pick of 11 of our 13 staff members.\n\nBeneil Dariush (16-4-1 MMA, 10-4-1 UFC) is only a -150 favorite in his lightweight fight against Frank Camacho (22-7 MMA, 2-3 UFC), but he\u2019s the biggest favorite among our staff members. Only one picker is taking Camacho to win a mild upset.\n\nCiryl Gane (4-0 MMA, 1-0 UFC) is a heavy favorite, as well, among our pickers in his heavyweight fight against Don'Tale Mayes (7-2 MMA, 0-0 UFC). Gane is the biggest favorite on the entire card at -360 and has an 11-2 picks lead.\n\nAnd to open the main card, Muslim Salikhov (15-2 MMA, 2-1 UFC) takes on Laureano Staropoli (9-1 MMA, 2-0 UFC) at welterweight in our most competitive fight, picks-wise. Salikhov nearly is a 2-1 favorite, but he has the narrowest possible picks lead at 7-6.\n\nIn the MMA Junkie reader consensus picks, Askren (64%), Johnson (79 percent), Dariush (78 percent), Gane (82 percent) and Salikhov (54 percent) are the choices.\n\nCheck out all the picks above.", "description": "Check out our staff members' picks for the UFC on ESPN+ 20 main card in Singapore.", "authors": ["Matt Erickson", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Nolan King", "Mmajunkie Staff", "Mike Bohn"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ufc-on-espn-plus-20-staff-picks.jpg?w=640&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
