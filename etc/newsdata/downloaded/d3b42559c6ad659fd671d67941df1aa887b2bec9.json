Ryan (R-Wis.). \u201cMembers have gotten out on a limb with this president many times only to have it be cut off by the president. They know he\u2019s erratic, and this is a completely unsteady and developing situation.\u201d\u2026\n\nFormer Republican senator Jeff Flake, a Trump antagonist, said his former colleagues believe the foreign leader interactions under investigation in the House represent \u201cnew territory\u201d compared with past challenges, including the Russia investigation.\n\n\u201cThere is a concern that he\u2019ll get through it and he\u2019ll exact revenge on those who didn\u2019t stand with him,\u201d Flake said. \u201cThere is no love for the president among Senate Republicans, and they aspire to do more than answer questions about his every tweet and issue. But they know this is the president\u2019s party and the bargain\u2019s been made.\u201d\u2026\n\nThis is not the first such crossroads, of course. Republicans largely stood behind Trump in 2016 after the release of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape on which he bragged of sexual assault, as well as during the darkest days of the Russia investigation and in the wake of racist comments.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Politics Out-On-A-Limb-Inside-The-Republican-Reckoning-Over-Trumps-Possible-Impeachment"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
