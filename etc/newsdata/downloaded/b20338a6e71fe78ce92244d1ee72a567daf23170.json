They fought well on Saturday to beat Southampton 2-1 with 10 men but this just does not look like the Mauricio Pochettino sides of old.\n\nI don\u2019t agree with Harry Kane\u2019s assertion after the game that the squad have been distracted by the transfer window. It\u2019s hardly the first window they\u2019ve been through.\n\nI just think there are a lot of unsettled players at Tottenham at the moment. Perhaps they feel uneasy about contract situations and players perhaps being moved on but there are a lot of players there that don\u2019t look happy.\n\nTottenham lack the energy and determination which have bought Mauricio Pochettino success\n\nOne thing I\u2019ve loved about Spurs in the last few years is their energy under Pochettino. They were always high-tempo, high-pressing but they seem to have lost that drive this season. They have to get that back if they are to scale the heights of the last few years.\n\nUsually with a Pochettino team it feels like there can never be any sloppiness because if the players made any mistakes, they would not be in the team any more. They would not just outplay teams, they would outwork them too. But that looks to have gone now.\n\nI don\u2019t think it is necessarily a hangover effect from their run to the Champions League final last season. They brought in a few players but it still feels like they do not have the luxury of being able to freshen up their starting XI each week. Record signing Tanguy Ndombele is starting to click and it was great to see him score again.\n\nTanguy Ndombele celebrates after scoring the opening goal against Southampton\n\nThey were badly let down by errors from Serge Aurier and Hugo Lloris on Saturday and Lloris in particular is a worry. In the last year the Frenchman has made a few mistakes you wouldn\u2019t expect from him.\n\nBut he is a World Cup winner, a fantastic goalkeeper and also the club captain, so it would be extremely difficult to think about leaving him out of the team.\n\nOne thing they are missing is creativity. Unless Christian Eriksen is playing, you really wonder where their ability to unlock defences is going to come from. Giovani Lo Celso, who joined this summer on loan from Real Betis, was supposed to help Eriksen with the creative burden and they need the Argentine back from his hip injury as soon as possible. When you need to unlock teams, you need that player who can do something special.\n\nTottenham look unable to unlock opposition defences without playmaker Christian Eriksen\n\nThey have, however, put together back-to-back home wins and that\u2019s important, because the new stadium has to become a fortress.\n\nThey welcome Bayern Munich to north London in the Champions League on Tuesday night and that is a huge game for them. They need a statement win to get the new stadium back to the atmosphere they had at White Hart Lane.\n\nThey have the quality. Now it\u2019s time to rediscover their drive.\n\nLiverpool have 23 goals this season already but their winner at Sheffield United was the first by a midfielder, and it was no surprise to see Georginio Wijnaldum score the all-important goal.\n\nHe is immense in midfield and if Liverpool are to win the title, their fans will be looking to him to deliver when the front three are not firing.\n\nGranit Xhaka was named Arsenal captain this week, but can a player who gives away so many silly fouls and picks up so many yellow cards really warrant the armband?\n\nWe do perhaps put too much emphasis on captains but they are your manager on the pitch and in Unai Emery\u2019s best XI I\u2019m not sure Xhaka would even start.\n\nHow can Granit Xhaka, a player who is so ill-disciplined, be worthy of the Arsenal captaincy?\n\nFOXES CAN CRACK THE TOP-SIX SAFE\n\nOutside of Manchester City and Liverpool, who are on another level, Leicester are the most exciting team to watch in the Premier League right now.\n\nThey\u2019re full of quality but for me the key is Wilfred Ndidi, who scored the fifth in their 5-0 win over Newcastle on Sunday. When N\u2019Golo Kante left it looked like they were in trouble but Ndidi has filled that role brilliantly, giving them so much balance and freeing up Youri Tielemans and James Maddison.\n\nLeicester have got everything going for them right now: the stadium, the fans, the fantastic manager Brendan Rodgers. If you\u2019ve got a season ticket at Leicester you\u2019re getting real value for money.\n\nThey\u2019ve made some astute signings and they can be a regular top-six side. Arsenal, Manchester United, Chelsea and Spurs will be really worried about this Leicester team.\n\nWatford\u2019s terrible start to the season, winless in seven games, has been coming for some time. You can\u2019t keep chopping and changing the manager; at some point the players have to pull their fingers out and take responsibility.\n\nYou can\u2019t be losing 8-0, down 5-0 inside 18 minutes as they were at Manchester City. What happens if they keep up this bad run, do they sack Quique Sanchez Flores as well? At this point, they and Newcastle look the most likely to go down.\n\nI was in Scotland this week playing with Luke Donald and Justin Rose at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship at St Andrews, a brilliantly well-run event.\n\nWhat it did remind me, however, is that I\u2019m glad I wasn\u2019t a golfer \u2014 it\u2019s far easier being a footballer! The stick I got from a few mates after topping one into the bunker on the 16th hole made me glad I\u2019m heading back to the day job this week.", "description": "JAMIE REDKNAPP: There is something not quite right at Tottenham at the moment.
