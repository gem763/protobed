She looked between 72-75. Her husband told us he is 80.\n\n\"It was surprising for me.\n\n\"Her age was a factor and then she was ill. She has one collapsed lung so it was a very challenging operation.\"\n\nThe mother has been discharged but the child is kept at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of the hospital where the doctors are monitoring her condition.\n\n\"She is at neonatal intensive care unit. We are monitoring her. The mother cannot feed her unless she gains weight.\n\n\"She needs to be at least 3.3lbs to be allowed home from hospital. She is stable and recovering fast.\"", "description": "Prabha Devi and her 80-year-old husband, from Rajasthan, India, had already adopted a child, but wanted to have a biological child too", "authors": ["Taniya Dutta", "Kelly-Ann Mills", "Image", "Caters News Agency", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20584155.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1044100210.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
