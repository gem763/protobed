Add Interest\n\nLam announced the ban at an afternoon news conference where she decried the escalation of violence recently after four months of anti-government demonstrations. The mask ban takes effect Saturday and applies to people at \u201cillegal\u201d gatherings who use violence and exempts those who wear masks for \u201clegitimate need.\u201d Lam said she would go to the legislature later to get legal backing for the rule.\n\nThousands of masked protesters chanted slogans calling for greater democracy as they marched in the city\u2019s business district before Lam spoke. They chanted \u201cI want to wear face masks\u201d and \u201cWearing mask is not a crime\u201d as many cars, stuck in traffic due to the march, honked in support.\n\n\u201cWill they arrest 100,000 people on the street? The government is trying to intimidate us but at this moment, I don\u2019t think the people will be scared,\u201d one protester, who gave his surname as Lui, told an online live broadcast.\n\nAt the nearby Causeway Bay shopping area, a huge crowd also occupied streets to protest the mask ban. Smaller rallies were also held in several other areas.\n\nAnalysts warned the use of the Emergency Ordinance for the first time in over half a decade set a dangerous precedent. The law, a relic of British rule enacted in 1922 to quell a seamens strike and last used to crush riots in 1967, gives broad powers to the city\u2019s chief executive to implement regulations in an emergency.\n\n\u201cEven though the mask ban is just a small move under the Emergency Ordinance, it is a dangerous first step. If the anti-mask legislation proves to be ineffective, it could lead the way to more draconian measures such as a curfew and other infringement of civil liberties,\u201d said Willy Lam, adjunct professor at the Chinese University.\n\nThe ban followed widespread violence in the city Tuesday that marred China\u2019s National Day and included a police officer shooting a protester, the first victim of gunfire since the protests started in June over a now-shelved extradition bill. The wounded teenager was charged with attacking police and rioting.\n\nThe movement has since snowballed into an anti-China campaign amid anger over what many view as Beijing\u2019s interference in Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy. More than 1,750 people have been detained so far.\n\nActivists and many legislators have warned the mask ban could be counter-productive, impractical and difficult to enforce in a city bubbling with anger and where tens of thousands have often defied police bans on rallies to take to the street.\n\n\u201cFive demands, not one less,\u201d many protesters shouted during Friday\u2019s rallies as they held up five fingers.\n\nThe government last month withdrew the extradition bill, widely slammed as an example of the erosion of Hong Kong\u2019s freedom, but protesters have widened their demands to include direct elections for the city\u2019s leaders, an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, the unconditional release of protesters and not characterizing the protests as riots.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
