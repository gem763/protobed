We do not know where they are,\u201d Jeffrey said when asked if the US knew where the fighters were or if the US could monitor them without US forces present.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s home page for more stories.\n\nJames Jeffrey, the US Special Representative for Syria engagement and global head of the coalition to defeat ISIS, told Congress on Wednesday that about 100 ISIS prisoners have escaped detention since the Turkish invasion of northeast Syria and that the US does not know their whereabouts.\n\nDuring a meeting with the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday, Jeffrey told New York Democratic Rep. Eliot Engel that over 100 ISIS prisoners had so far escaped the custody of the Syrian Democratic Forces, reinforcing Secretary of Defense Mark T. Esper\u2019s statements about escaped ISIS prisoners on Tuesday\n\n\u201cWe know from previous briefings these ISIS detainees are among the most dangerous fighters, intent on attacking the United States and its allies,\u201d Engel said during Wednesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cDoes the US have an idea where these individuals are, and is the US able to monitor or effectively operate against ISIS, given the withdrawal of US forces?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would say that the number is now over 100. We do not know where they are,\u201d Jeffrey answered.\n\nExperts have previously told Insider about the risk of ISIS fighters breaking out of prison amid the chaos of the Turkish incursion into northeast Syria.\n\n\u201cWe know in the past, they\u2019ve done prison breakouts. They\u2019ve seen it as a top priority,\u201d said Daniel Byman, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Center for Middle East Policy.\n\nDuring a press conference on Friday, President Donald Trump insisted the situation in northeast Syria was under control.\n\nISIS fighters are \u201cunder very, very strict lock and key,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office. He did concede that \u201ca small number got out, relatively speaking,\u201d but, contradicting Jeffrey, he said \u201cthey have largely been recaptured.\u201d\n\nIlham Ehmed, the co-chair of the Syrian Democratic Council, testified before Congress Wednesday that 600 ISIS members, including family members, had escaped, with 18 foreigners among that number.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what role US forces will play in fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria going forward. The soldiers retreating from northeast Syria were to be redeployed to Iraq, whose government said the troops could only transit the country and would not be allowed to redeploy there. Trump has said that a small number of soldiers will remain in Syria.\n\nInsider reached out to the State Department for further comment on Jeffrey\u2019s remarks but did not receive a response by press time.", "description": "Business Insider - US special envoy for Syria James Jeffrey told Congress on Wednesday that 100 ISIS prisoners have escaped.
