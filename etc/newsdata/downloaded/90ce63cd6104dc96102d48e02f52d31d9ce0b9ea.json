Its\n\nmessage will essentially be that while it could act in December\n\nif needed, it won't unless there are big uncertainties on the\n\neconomy.\"\n\nOptimism that Washington and Beijing would finalise the\n\nfirst-stage of a trade deal next month had boosted risk assets\n\nin recent days, but markets turned wary on the prospect this\n\ncould be delayed.\n\nA U.S. administration official said on Tuesday an interim\n\ntrade agreement between the United States and China might not be\n\ncompleted in time for signing in Chile next month as expected,\n\nbut that does not mean the accord is falling apart. Meanwhile, hopes that a disorderly Brexit can still be\n\navoided supported the pound.\n\nBritain will hold its first December election in almost a\n\ncentury after Prime Minister Boris Johnson won approval from\n\nparliament on Tuesday for an early ballot aimed at breaking the\n\ndeadlock over the UK leaving the European Union. On Monday, the EU agreed to a three-month flexible delay to\n\nBritain's departure. The pound climbed as high as $1.2903 overnight on news that\n\nan election date was likely to be agreed but pared gains after\n\nthe House of Commons approved Johnson's bill calling for a Dec.\n\n12 election by 438 to 20.\n\nCable last stood at $1.2867 GBP=D4 .\n\n\"Sterling has struggled to hold onto modest knee-jerk gains\n\nbecause the outcome of an election is highly uncertain,\" said\n\nRay Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank.", "description": "FOREX-Dollar marks time ahead of Fed move, sterling steadies", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEE1F13X_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
