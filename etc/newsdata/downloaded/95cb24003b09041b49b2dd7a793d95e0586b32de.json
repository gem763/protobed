Politicians the 'least trusted' profession in the world", "language": "en", "text": "The morality and effectiveness of politicians has emerged as a worldwide concern according to a massive Ipsos global poll conducted in 22 countries, and gauging the reliability of 18 common professions.\n\n\u201cPoliticians are the least trusted group globally,\u201d the meticulous research reports. \u201cIn all countries polled, politicians are seen as the most untrustworthy profession \u2014 globally, two-thirds of the public (67%) consider politicians generally to be untrustworthy,\u201d the research said.\n\n\u201cThey spent a bunch of money on a worldwide poll to find that out?\u201d notes one informed source.\n\nMoving right along, only 2% of the world\u2019s population say politicians are \u201cvery trustworthy\u201d according to Ipsos which asked respondents to rank their sentiments on a scale of 1-5, from \u201cvery trustworthy\u201d to \u201cvery untrustworthy.\u201d\n\nIt is of note that only 5% deem journalists to be very trustworthy; 6% said the same of TV news anchors.\n\nScientists are the most trusted by the planet\u2019s general population, followed by doctors, teachers and the military.\n\n\u201cMembers of the armed forces are the fourth most trustworthy profession overall, seen as trustworthy by 43% overall. Perceptions of the trustworthiness of servicemen and women are highest in China (72%), India (70%) and the U.S. (60%), while they are particularly low in Germany (24%) and South Korea (18%),\u201d the poll analysis says. \u201cTrust in the police \u2014 overall the fifth-most trusted profession at 38% \u2014 ranges widely from 80% in China to 11% in Mexico.\u201d\n\nIn all, 9 of 22 countries in the index have positive scores. This means that most of the professions listed have net positive scores and more people consider them to be trustworthy than not. The remaining 13 countries have negative scores, which indicates higher levels of distrust.

But it\u2019ll cost you.\n\n\u201cFor the past three years, the socialist Democrats have been obsessed with impeaching the president and backfilling in the reason after the fact. They have become so radicalized by their hatred of President Trump that they are willing to plunge the nation into a constitutional crisis based on secondhand gossip,\u201d advises Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, National Republican Congressional Committee chairman.\n\n\u201cDemocrats have lost their sanity and any remaining credibility with the American people. Make no mistake about it: backing impeachment will cost the Democrats their majority in 2020,\u201d he declares.\n\nThe BAND-AID OF IMPEACHMENT\n\nThe appeal of one topic has worn thin. Buckle up, though. It\u2019s going to get serious now.\n\n\u201cFor the love of God, Democrats, stop telling us how seriously you\u2019re thinking about impeaching the president, and just do it or drop the issue; how Trump\u2019s accusations about Hunter Biden help Joe Biden in the Democratic primary; why some people can\u2019t perceive irony; and straw-gate. Go Ahead, Democrats. Rip off the Band-Aid of Impeachment. Get it over with,\u201d writes National Review columnist Jim Geraghty.\n\n\u201cThe conventional wisdom is that an impeachment effort would probably strengthen Trump\u2019s reelection odds. But Democrats might also wonder if their constant talk of impeachment but continued refusal to go through with it adds to the perception that nothing the president has done is out of the ordinary or all that bad,\u201d Mr. Geraghty notes.\n\nA 2020 VICTORY IN THE MAKING\n\nColumnist Andrew Malcolm is pondering the chances of a win for President Trump on Election Day, 2020 \u2014 now 58 weeks off.\n\n\u201cFact is, most presidents seeking reelection get it \u2014 only four elected presidents seeking second terms have lost since 1900. At 73, Trump seems unlikely to change his behavior, especially since he firmly believes his unpredictability is one of his strongest suits,\u201d writes Mr. Malcolm in an essay for McClatchy News.\n\n\u201cTo be kind, Trump\u2019s behavior is unorthodox. Which is precisely why just enough 2016 frustrated voters in just the right places chose the unlikely man whose campaign actions, tactics and words augured a stark contrast to the more decorous style and behavior of traditional White House residents,\u201d says the columnist, who cites a statistical reality.\n\n\u201cDespite all the tumult, Trump\u2019s 37% reelect approval in the first midterm year is essentially identical at the identical time to those who said Bill Clinton and Barack Obama deserved a second term. As you may recall, both men succeeded,\u201d he writes.\n\nBORDERLINE INSANITY\n\nOne gathering addresses the border crisis with unblinking candor. The Federation for American Immigration Reform\u2019s annual \u201cHold Their Feet to the Fire\u201d event gets underway Wednesday in the nation\u2019s capital featuring 70 national talk radio hosts broadcasting live from D.C. over the next 48 hours. In addition, numerous lawmakers and 191 U.S. sheriffs will also have a say at the two-day event.\n\n\u201cLax enforcement, asylum abuse, obstructionist partisan positions, and hostile courts have created chaos at our southern border. This ongoing crisis is the reason radio hosts, sheriffs, and others will discuss, debate, sort truth from fiction, hear first-hand accounts and consider reasonable solutions,\u201d the organizers advise. \u201cAt a minimum, barriers have to be built, asylum loopholes closed, more resources brought to bear, and the rule of law enforced. Most importantly, Americans \u2014 and those who protect Americans \u2014 will be heard.\u201d\n\nFind the host organization at Fairus.org.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 60% of the world population rate scientists as \u201ctrustworthy\u201d or \u201cvery trustworthy\u201d; 56% say the same of doctors, 52% of teachers and 43% of armed forces personnel.\n\n\u2022 38% rate the police as trustworthy or very trustworthy; 37% say the same of \u201cordinary people,\u201d 32% of judges and 25% of lawyers.\n\n\u2022 24% say the same of TV news anchors; 23% say the same of pollsters, 23% of civil servants and 22% of business leaders.\n\n\u2022 21% say the same of journalists; 21% of clergy, 12% of government officials and 9% of \u201cpoliticians generally.\u201d\n\nSource: An IPSOS Global Index poll of 19,587 adults in 23 countries conducted throughout October 2018 and released Tuesday.\n\n\u2022 Helpful information to [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
