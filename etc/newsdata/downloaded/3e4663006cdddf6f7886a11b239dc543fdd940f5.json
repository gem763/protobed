Reality TV is part of \u201ca larger derangement,\u201d he says, a breakdown in the division between the real and the unreal that he worries now plagues the three countries he has spent his career exploring\u2014India, the U.K. and the U.S.\n\nAll of these pieces come crashing together in the dark, frenetic world of Mr. Rushdie\u2019s new novel, \u201cQuichotte,\u201d his 14th. His process always works this way, he says: \u201cIt\u2019s like there\u2019s a jigsaw puzzle trying to form in my head.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuichotte\u201d is a retelling of \u201cDon Quixote,\u201d the 17th-century classic by Cervantes. It features an Indian-born salesman whose gluttonous consumption of television has resulted in a \u201cpeculiar form of brain damage\u201d that leaves him unable to distinguish between truth and lies, reality and \u201creality.\u201d He falls in love with Salma R., a celebrity talk-show host, and believes himself destined to win her hand, like Quixote in pursuit of Dulcinea. With an imaginary son named Sancho, Quichotte sets out on a quest across America to win his ladylove.\n\nIn his new novel, \u2018Quichotte,\u2019 Mr. Rushdie writes that we live in the \u2018Age of Anything-Can-Happen.\u2019 Photo: Brad Trent for The Wall Street Journal\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018If Cervantes were around now, what would his target be?\u2019\u201d says Mr. Rushdie. Using the familiar modes of picaresque fiction\u2014with its mix of satire and comedy\u2014he takes his Quichotte on a journey that he calls a \u201cpanorama of now.\u201d\n\nIt is the \u201cAge of Anything-Can-Happen,\u201d Mr. Rushdie writes\u2014an age in which it is \u201cno longer possible to predict the weather, or the likelihood of war, or the outcome of elections.\u201d In \u201cQuichotte,\u201d he uses his trademark magical realism to highlight his sense that reality has become surreal\u2014grim and disjointed. \u201cNothing goes according to the old rules anymore,\u201d he says. \u201cWe live in a moment in which truth is stranger than fiction, and so fiction has to decide how strange it needs to be in order to get close to the truth.\u201d\n\nThe tale takes place across a landscape overrun by what the novel calls the \u201cenemies of contemporary reality,\u201d among them antivaccine agitators, climate-change deniers and an unnamed American president. At one point, Quichotte stumbles on a town where the people have turned into mastodons\u2014aggressive beasts from the prehuman past that disdain education and common sense. It all ends, naturally, with the apocalypse.\n\n\u201c \u2018Fiction has to decide how strange it needs to be in order to get close to the truth.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMr. Rushdie was born in Bombay in 1947, the year of India\u2019s independence from the U.K. At 14, he was shipped off to boarding school in England. At 28, his first novel was published.\n\nIn 1989, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, declared Mr. Rushdie\u2019s third novel, \u201cThe Satanic Verses,\u201d blasphemous and issued a fatwa offering a bounty for his murder. Mr. Rushdie lived under the protection of the British secret service and took on a false identity, \u201cJoseph Anton,\u201d a mashup of the first names of two of his favorite writers, Joseph Conrad and Anton Chekhov. \u201cIt felt like entering a bad novel by me,\u201d he quips.\n\nDid that fragmented, paranoid existence affect his fiction? \u201cIt didn\u2019t,\u201d he insists\u2014except that he got to meet a lot of intriguing people who wound up in his novels. \u201cI\u2019ve been in that James Bond building on the river several times,\u201d he says, referring to the headquarters of MI6, the British intelligence service. In 2012, he spun those experiences into a novel-like memoir, \u201cJoseph Anton.\u201d These days, he\u2019d rather not talk about the fatwa (\u201cIt\u2019s ancient history\u201d).\n\nKhomeini\u2019s decree may be history, but the debate it provoked\u2014about free speech, censorship and cultural sensitivity\u2014is still alive. Mr. Rushdie says he is \u201cvery annoyed\u201d with conservatives who declare themselves silenced when they are disinvited from college campuses. \u201cFree speech doesn\u2019t mean you have the right to walk in anywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s not an infringement of free speech; it\u2019s an editorial decision about who you want to invite.\u201d\n\n\u201c \u2018It\u2019s when someone says something you absolutely can\u2019t stand\u2014that\u2019s when you discover if you believe in free speech or not.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAt the same time, he is also irritated with what he sees as the rise of a censorship mentality on the left, in the form of \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d or objections to books deemed offensive. \u201cI do think that young, liberal opinion in this country needs to remember that when you start trying to limit things that you find unpleasant, you put yourself on very shaky ground,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of no trick to believe in free speech for people you agree with or are indifferent to. It\u2019s when someone says something you absolutely can\u2019t stand\u2014that\u2019s when you discover if you believe in free speech or not.\u201d\n\nMr. Rushdie has lived in the U.S. for nearly two decades, serving as president of the nonprofit free-speech group PEN American Center and teaching, first at Emory University and now at New York University. In 2016, he became an American citizen. His novels\u2014which have always spanned East and West\u2014have migrated with him.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve always been interested in doing, which is risky, is to write up against the present,\u201d says Mr. Rushdie. \u201cIf you get it wrong, your book is valueless, like yesterday\u2019s papers. But if you get it right, you capture the moment for a long time.\u201d He likens the challenge to Hemingway\u2019s account of bullfighting: The greatest matador \u201cworks closest to the bull\u201d\u2014but make the slightest mistake, and \u201cyou have a horn in your side.\u201d\n\nWrite to Elizabeth Winkler at elizabeth.winkler@wsj.com", "description": "In his 14th novel, \u201cQuichotte,\u201d the author uses his trademark magical realism to try to capture his sense of a surreal moment.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Winkler", "Elizabeth.Winkler Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-EV035_RUSHDI_SOC_20190827121804.jpg"}
