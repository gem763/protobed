And I hope he comes clean about it.\u201d\n\nIn a clip of the interview which aired Thursday night on NBC Nightly News, Roberts talk about her shocked reaction to Epstein\u2019s death last month.\n\n\u201cI was in mourning,\u201d Giuffre said. \u201cNot because the world lost a monster, I wasn\u2019t mourning the death of this man.\n\n\u201cI was mourning the death of my ability to hold this man accountable.\u201d\n\nNBC said that the program also includes an interview with Michael Reiter, the former Palm Beach Chief of Police who oversaw the original investigation into Epstein.\n\nReiter tells Guthrie that his department\u2019s investigation more than a decade ago uncovered substantial evidence of Epstein\u2019s crimes, but subsequent handling by state and federal prosecutors was deeply flawed. He describes it as \u201cthe worst failure of the criminal justice system in modern times.\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew, Maxwell and others deny Giuffre\u2019s allegations.", "description": "Prince Andrew might have thought coverage of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein was winding down, but a televised interview with an alleged sex slave will reopen the controversy.", "authors": ["Tom Sykes"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_576,w_1024,x_0,y_47/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568971472/GettyImages-109823166_di52lt", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
