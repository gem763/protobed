Mostly, though, he\u2019s asking why recipes pretty much always do this.\n\nAs pet peeves go, this is an evergreen among food writers. \u201cWe don\u2019t add cumin or paprika to every single dish, so why should we add pepper?\u201d said Emma Christensen on web magazine Kitchn. \u201cSalt needs a new companion,\u201d opined Sara Dinkerman for Slate. \u201cPut the pepper down!\u201d ordered Emma Laperruque last year on Food52.\n\nRead all those pieces, and you\u2019ll find a common theme: salt and pepper might, for historical reasons, be joined at the culinary hip, but that doesn\u2019t mean they have to be. In Salt Fat Acid Heat, Samin Nosrat explains that salt, as a mineral, serves both chemical and gustatory functions (it tenderises meat, draws water out of vegetables, it insulates and ensures even cooking when used to bake fish, enhances flavour), whereas pepper is just a spice. It is only about flavour. The reason it gets to plays centre court on the dinner table is simply that, of all the spices, it got there first. Using it at this point in time is something of a civilisational habit.\n\nSo the first step is to realise that you don\u2019t always have to replace it with anything. Or, as chef Asma Khan puts it: \u201cThe kick it brings is not always necessary.\u201d Former Bake Off contestant and food writer Chetna Makan agrees: \u201cI\u2019ve got pepper just sitting there. I don\u2019t use much of it. It can easily be skipped in Indian cuisine \u2013 it\u2019s not essential.\u201d\n\nOf course, you might just love it. For Jeremy Lee, of London\u2019s Quo Vadis, cooking and eating without pepper is nothing less than tragic. But he is quick to point to several replacements \u2013 on the spice rack, the condiment shelf and the produce aisle \u2013 that can bring a similar punch. In savoury settings, he\u2019d plump for \u201ca dash of Tabasco, mustard or horseradish spread liberally, or a good-quality peppery leaf such as mustard or rocket.\u201d Makan suggests paprika, for its smokiness, and food writer Jennifer Joyce Sichuan pepper (not, in fact, a type of pepper, but the fragrant bud of the prickly ash tree). Everyone I speak to suggests the obvious: a pinch of dried chilli flakes, preferably a mild on,e such as the Turkish pul biber.\n\nNow, it\u2019s tempting to think that pasta cacio e pepe, say, would be impossible to make without pepper, given that it\u2019s literally there in the name of the dish, but I\u2019d happily eat a bowlful of cheesy pasta with any one of the substitutes listed above (well, maybe not the horseradish). The point is, given that pepper is just about flavour and not necessity, you are free to raid your pantry and try things out until you find another flavour that works.\n\nThe same applies to sweet things. Anna Jones pairs black pepper with cherries in a streusel muffin, while the New York Times\u2019 Mark Bittman is famous for a recipe in which he macerates strawberries in balsamic vinegar and black pepper. In both instances, the spice is a highlight, not a default setting, and Lee suggests nutmeg, cinnamon, mace, allspice, even cloves \u2013 \u201ca happy thought\u201d, he says. There are so many more spices out there, none of which, Laperruque notes, are all-purpose. Each brings their own unique flavour. Ultimately, being unable to eat pepper is an invitation to free your tastebuds and try stuff out. That is where the magic lies.\n\nDo you have a culinary dilemma?
