They travelled at an average speed of 5mph as they weaved through traffic.\n\nData showed it took paramedics 14 minutes, on average, to respond to 911 calls that were not life-threatening.\n\nThe drones made it to the scene in six-and-a-half minutes in all instances, travelling slightly faster at 6.5mph.\n\nBaby on small Pacific island becomes the first child in the WORLD to be given a vaccine delivered by a drone A one-month-old baby became the first child in the world to ever be given a vaccine that was delivered by a commercial drone last December. Joy Nowai, is from Vanuatu - a cluster of islands in the South Pacific, where one in five youngsters miss out on essential childhood jabs. The drone took just 25 minutes to travel almost 24.8miles (40km) over rugged mountains until it reached the remote Cook's Bay, which has no hospital or electricity. Only accessible on foot or by small local boats, the same journey usually takes hours. Once landed, a nurse vaccinated 13 local children and five pregnant women against polio, TB, hepatitis B, measles and rubella. Joy, who was born on November 15, was immunised against just TB and Hep B. These should have been given within a day of her birth but there were no nurses available.\n\n\n\nThis meant the gadgets were 32 per cent faster at arriving to emergency calls and 53 per cent faster in non emergency circumstances.\n\nThe findings will be presented at the American Academy of Pediatrics 2019 National Conference and Exhibition in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\nLead author Dr Mark Hanna said: 'Drones, when used appropriately, represent the ideal marriage between enhanced prehospital care and telemedicine for our future.\n\n'This may prove to be profound in the unique pediatric setting. UAS [Drone] response in acute medical interventions in an inner city environment will reach responders faster and more quickly than compared to standard EMS ambulance calls.\n\n'Possible life saving interventions with first response associated with UAS can include acute anaphylaxis, opiate overdose, asthma and cardiac arrest as these conditions have been associated with decreased mortality based on time to intervention by first responders.\n\n'Future investigation into how UAS systems are necessary in the future scope of emergent health management in the pediatric population.'\n\nMailOnline reported in April that a kidney delivered by drone had been transplanted into a patient in need for the first time ever.\n\nUniversity of Maryland doctors and engineers worked together to create a custom, unmanned drone that could carry an organ with perfect stability.\n\nThey monitored it and communicated with the teams on the ground, as the 44-year-old's new kidney travelled more than two miles.", "description": "Scientists compared the speed of paramedics and the unmanned gadgets during rush hour in Brooklyn.
