When Bernie Sanders bashes billionaires or Elizabeth Warren goes after big corporations, most people within earshot get to feeling like populists. Harris\u2019 campaign is very good at organizing demonstrations of support on behalf of \u201cKamala for the People.\u201d Pete Buttigieg and Beto O\u2019Rourke have shown signs of developing a bit of a cult of personality among excited followers. Joe Biden\u2019s adept at getting into the swing of things at African-American churches, and could probably turn a Knights of Columbus Bingo Night into something special.\n\nBut for a distinctly wild and entirely spontaneous political crowd, it\u2019s hard to beat Andrew Yang and his Gang, as they showed early this week in the City of the Angels. The Los Angeles Times had the story:\n\nThe underdog Democratic presidential hopeful Andrew Yang walked onstage at MacArthur Park on Monday night with the swagger of a competitor who\u2019s already won, complete with a pyrotechnic display and the 1990s R&B classic \u201cReturn of the Mack\u201d playing on the speaker system\u2026.\n\nYang\u2019s showmanship, humorously math-based approach to solving America\u2019s problems and his love of f-bombs have won him a diverse and ear-splitting following that was on full display at his Los Angeles rally.\n\nMembers of the \u201cYang Gang\u201d and the Yang-curious packed the lawn in front of the amphitheater where the candidate spoke, many hoisting signs with single words on them that anywhere else wouldn\u2019t seem to go together: Some just said \u201cMath.\u201d Others said \u201cHumanity.\u201d\n\nThe atmosphere was not, shall we say, that of an old-school political rally featuring corny patriotic songs or venerable protests songs\u2013or the refashioned Top 40 music that boomer pols from Bill Clinton (\u201cDon\u2019t Stop Thinking About Tomorrow\u201d) to Donald Trump (\u201cYou Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want\u201d) always favored:\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a typical campaign rally. It was more like a revival set to hip-hop, with one-liners that much of the crowd knew by heart.\n\nAny time Yang said the word \u201cmath,\u201d the crowd chanted \u201cMath!\u201d \u201cMath!\u201d \u201cMath!\u201d as part of the nerdy-cool theater of his campaign events. Several people brought signs featuring a thousand-dollar bill with Yang\u2019s face on it.\n\nThat would be an allusion to Yang\u2019s signature policy initiative, a Universal Basic Income of $1,000 a month designed to offset mass unemployment caused by intensified automation. But increasingly the 44-year-old entrepreneur\u2019s untraditional style is getting as much attention as his substance:\n\n\u201cHe represents something that\u2019s beyond politics,\u201d said Lee-kai Wong, 34, a genetics lab worker at UCLA. \u201cThe way he talks about the country \u2014 it\u2019s a message of healing. I think we need a little more mercy and forgiveness.\u201d\n\nYang\u2019s campaign is still in the single digits in polling, but his support and the donations that go along with it have gotten him onto the stage of every Democratic debate so far \u2014 beating out political veterans and more traditional candidates.\n\nTony Moreno, 52, a professional driver from Ontario, said Yang \u201ccrosses every color line there is\u201d culturally and politically.\n\nAs I can testify upon abundantly hearing from the Yang Gang after writing that he had no plausible path to the nomination, the Gang is very outspoken on social media. They pretty clearly view their candidate as sui generis and the fomenter of a potential political revolution. Plus they believe deeply in his coolness:\n\nThe crowd at MacArthur Park kept urging Yang to body-surf over his amassed supporters, but he\u2019s already riding a wave.\n\nHe\u2019s raising money and performing in polls well enough, it seems, to stay on the debate stage with the more traditional candidates at least through November, at which point a lot of his rivals may drop out. So keep an eye on Yang and the Gang. However little media coverage they receive, they are pretty good at gaining attention.", "description": "Andrew Yang\u2019s raucous rally in Los Angeles nicely illustrated his unconventional campaign with its signature $1000-a-month universal basic income proposal and its enthusiastic Yang Gang following, which has lifted him above a number of rivals.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/01/01-andrew-yang.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
