But the back-to-back appearances also exposed some fissures among the Democrats over other ideas.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, who is leading most public polls, released a gun reform proposal hours before the event that called for banning online sales and repealing a law that gives gun makers special protections against civil liability.\n\n\"Imagine if the same law existed for drug companies that existed for gun companies,\" Biden said.\n\nBut Biden does not support some other candidates' proposals, such as a mandatory buyback program for assault-style weapons or a national licensing requirement.\n\nIn his remarks, Booker - the first presidential candidate to call for licensing earlier this year - noted most people already support the concept.\n\n\"You should not be a nominee from our party that can seriously stand in front of urban places and say, 'I will protect you,' if you don't believe in gun licensing,\" Booker said.\n\nFormer U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke, who has made gun safety the central cause of his campaign since a gunman murdered 22 people in his hometown of El Paso, Texas, two months ago, echoed his vow to force people to give up \"weapons of war\" through buybacks.\n\nSeveral candidates spoke about the particular toll gun violence has on communities of color, as well as the psychological damage done to children fearful of school shootings.\n\nU.S. Senator Kamala Harris said teachers had told her they have lollipops on hand to keep the youngest students quiet in the event of an attack.\n\n\"This is traumatizing our children,\" she said.\n\nIn Washington, the Republican majority in the U.S. Senate has shown little appetite for new limits. Trump, whose 2016 campaign was bolstered by millions of dollars from the National Rifle Association, has offered mixed signals.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump blamed the Democrats' impeachment investigation for a lack of progress on gun safety, a claim that U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren decried as an \"alternative reality.\"\n\nSeveral candidates sought to tie gun safety to the broader themes of their campaigns.\n\nWarren said gun violence has gone unchecked for the same reason that climate change and drug prices remained unaddressed in Washington: powerful companies have bought off politicians.\n\n\"You have to stop and ask yourself the question: What is so badly broken in this democracy that something that the overwhelming majority of Americans want to see done doesn't get done,\" she said. \"And the answer is, there's too much power in the hands of the gun industry and the gun lobby.\"\n\nBiden, who has argued that defeating Trump is the most important thing for Democrats to accomplish, said he expected new laws would pass easily once \"we get this guy out of office.\"\n\nAndrew Yang, the entrepreneur whose signature proposal is giving every American $1,000 a month, argued that universal basic income would help ameliorate much of the economic distress that contributes to gun violence.", "description": "Nine of the leading candidates gathered in Las Vegas for an all-day forum on gun safety, a day after the city marked two years since it suffered the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, which killed 58 people.
