However they're known to make some cool-looking smartwatches and this time, we got to try out their most premium smartwatch, the TicWatch Pro that is priced at Rs 22,999.\n\nI got to spend a few weeks with this Google Wear OS smartwatch and here's what I liked and disliked about the TicWatch Pro.\n\nWhat I Liked\n\nThe look and feel\n\nTicWatch Pro blends in a semi-casual aesthetic with a premium metal body that feels great to wear. The display is a 1.3-inch round OLED display in a 45mm body that makes this watch perfect for people with thick wrists. You get two buttons -- the top one gets you into the apps and the second one is to track specific fitness activities. The watch gets IP68 dust and water resistance and strikes a perfect weight balance to not feel too heavy or too light\n\nDon't Miss 1 K SHARES 21.5 K SHARES 573 SHARES 354 SHARES 6 K SHARES\n\nA comforting fit\n\nYou get a hybrid strap with the TicWatch Pro where the inside is silicon, whereas on the outside you get faux leather stitched on the silicone that makes it look more premium. The rubber felt really good and didn't make me worry about leather with my hands sweating. Moreover, it didn't pull any hair on my wrists too, which definitely is an added bonus.\n\nEase of strap customisation\n\nThe TicWatch Pro has a universal strap layout so basically you can fit in straps of any material or colour that are commonly available and pair it with the smartwatch. Swapping straps is simple too, so you can easily snap-off and switch straps to suit your style.\n\nThe second display comes in handy\n\nTicWatch has fused another display, along with the OLED screen -- a FSTN or Film compensated Super Twisted Nematic display. This panel is monochromatic and only displays time, steps and battery life.\n\nIn case your smartwatch battery dies, this display will still continue to show you time and track your steps, and function like a regular digital watch.\n\nPerformance\n\nUnder the hood, you get a dated Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 2100 paired with 512MB and 4GB of storage. While it isn't the best specs on table, I didn't experience any jitters or lags in the experience. Wear OS by Google did a phenomenal job of helping me stay in sync with notifications with the TicWatch Pro while I was commuting. Hated the time-consuming initial pairing process though.\n\nWhat I Disliked\n\nDisplay\n\nEven though the TicWatch Pro gets an OLED panel, the colours on the panel weren't the best. The blacks weren't as rich as you'd expect from an OLED, and overall it didn't feel as premium as you'd want in a smartwatch at this price point.\n\nBattery life\n\nThis won't be surprising as smartwatches don't end up lasting as long as you want them to. Even on the TicWatch Pro, if you turn on all the features-- like always display on, or regular heart-rate tracking etc. The 415 mAh battery managed to give me a day and a half's life on average. While it isn't very bad, I would have loved to last a while longer. Sure, you can disable a few options to make the TicWatch Pro last longer, but that will be a compromise.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe TicWatch Pro is a cool smartwatch that manages to nail the basics right, with a few rough edges. Even though flexible customisation option and the LSTN display is a cool addition, the main display could have been better. Moreover, even though I can ignore the not-so-impressive battery performance, I don't see it worth Rs 22,999.\n\nI won't deny, I thoroughly enjoyed using it, but would definitely think twice to buy it at that price point. Brands like Fossil, Samsung are providing tempting options that also feel more premium at that price point. However, I would surely consider if I see its prices drop in online sales.", "description": "Chances are you might not have heard of the brand TicWatch in the past.
