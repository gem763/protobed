I don't see the social situation being easily resolved, and I don't see it getting better. So my forecast is pretty gloomy,\" said David Roche, founder and strategist at research firm Independent Strategy.\n\nOn Tuesday, an 18-year-old protester was shot by a live bullet, amid violent brawls between the police and demonstrators on China's National Day.\n\n\"The police have become the enemy especially after the shooting of the young school boy,\" said longtime resident and business leader Allan Zeman. \"They get provoked first and then of course they defend themselves.\"\n\nWhile the shooting has further galvanized anti-government protesters against the police force, authorities maintain that the officer fired his weapon with the intention to stop, not kill. Multiple videos of the altercation show protesters carrying objects like wrenches and hammers.\n\nWhile Zeman, has lived in the global financial center through the 1997 handover scare, the real estate mogul said this \"earthquake\" \u2014 the ongoing mass demonstrations \u2014 is different from the other tumultuous times he witnessed in the city.\n\n\"For Hong Kong to maintain its edge, we have to find a way forward,\" said Zeman, who has lived in the city for more than four decades and serves as an economic advisor to Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam.", "description": "Amid escalating violent clashes between the police and demonstrators, businesses have been hit and social order has been disrupted.", "authors": ["Grace Shao"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106079130-1565806348280gettyimages-1161482956.jpeg?v=1570069293"}
