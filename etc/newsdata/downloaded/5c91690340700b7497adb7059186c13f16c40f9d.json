PRECIOUS-Gold eases as dollar firms; caution sets in ahead of trade talks\n\n* U.S. Fed minutes due on Wednesday\n\n* Trade talks scheduled in Washington on Oct. 10-11\n\n* German industrial orders fall more than expected in August\n\n\n\n(Updates prices)\n\nBy Sumita Layek\n\nOct 7 (Reuters) - Gold prices eased on Monday as the dollar\n\nfirmed after a report said China was reluctant to agree to a\n\nbroad trade deal with Washington, but bullion held a tight range\n\nas investors took a wait-and-see approach ahead of U.S.-China\n\ntalks this week.\n\nSpot gold was down 0.3 % at $1,499.79 per ounce at\n\n1129 GMT. Prices firmed 0.5% last week on concerns of slowing\n\nglobal growth.\n\nU.S. gold futures GCcv1 slipped 0.5% to $1,505.30 per\n\nounce.\n\nThe United States and China are set to meet for trade\n\nnegotiations in Washington on Oct. 10-11, although latest news\n\nreports suggest Beijing may be looking to restrict the scope of\n\nany deal. \"Gold seems to have run out of steam here, we just need a\n\ntrigger for the market to move. The fact that the dollar is a\n\ntad higher is the reason gold is a bit softer,\" said Saxo Bank\n\ncommodity strategist Ole Hansen.\n\n\"Gold is holding on to what it knows best and right now it\n\nknows the $1,500 level quite well. It's going to be a little bit\n\nof a wait-and-see week, with the U.S. Federal Reserve minutes\n\nand the trade talks due this week.\"\n\nThe Fed Open Market Committee's minutes from its September\n\nmeeting are due on Wednesday.\n\nThe dollar edged up against rivals after four\n\nstraight days of losses last week, with China's offshore yuan\n\nand the euro both pressured.

But that did little to change market expectations that the\n\nFederal Reserve will likely cut interest rates at its next\n\npolicy review on Oct. 29-30 to support the economy.\n\n\"Gold continues to get appraised against the U.S. bond\n\nyields and what the Federal Reserve is going to do next,\" said\n\nAxiTrader market strategist Stephen Innes in a note.\n\n\"So, while price action seems supportive enough to suggest a\n\nlong bias remains intact, ... market participants likely need\n\nfurther evidence from the Fed Board that they are shifting to an\n\neasing bias to push prices significantly higher.\"\n\nElsewhere, platinum XPT= was down 0.1% to $877.18, silver\n\ndipped 0.6% to $17.45 and palladium XPD= fell 0.3% to\n\n$1,660.29.\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold eases as dollar firms; caution sets in ahead of trade talks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEAAJ0FF_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
