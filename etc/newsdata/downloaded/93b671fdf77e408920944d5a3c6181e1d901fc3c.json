The Sunday Review essay focused on his time at Yale, when a fellow student, Deborah Ramirez, says he thrust his penis at her during a dorm party. (Justice Kavanaugh has denied the incident occurred.)\n\nThe authors\u2019 intent in describing the demographic and cultural changes occurring at Yale then was to provide important context for understanding both Justice Kavanaugh and Ms. Ramirez.\n\nThe essay included new information that illuminated the authors\u2019 broader narrative and bolstered their conclusion that, even though Senate investigators concluded her account lacked corroboration, Ms. Ramirez\u2019s claims were in fact credible.\n\nStrength of the accusation\n\nSome readers have argued that the latest accusation against Mr. Kavanaugh was too weak to appear in The Times. Given that the woman who was said to be involved in the incident refused to be interviewed, and her friends have said she doesn\u2019t remember what happened, why did you include that accusation in the essay?\n\nDAO: The essay included a previously unreported claim that friends pushed Mr. Kavanaugh\u2019s penis into the hand of a female Yale student during a dorm party with drunken classmates. During the authors\u2019 investigation, they learned that a classmate, Max Stier, witnessed the event and later reported it to senators and to the F.B.I. The authors corroborated his story with two government officials, who said they found it credible. Based on that corroboration, we felt mentioning the claim as one part of a broader essay was warranted.\n\nOffensive tweet\n\nThe Times has since deleted and apologized for an offensive tweet that published with this essay from the Opinion desk\u2019s Twitter account. Can you say anything more about how such an inappropriate tweet went out, and what, if anything, is being done to prevent that from happening again?", "description": "The Times\u2019s deputy editorial page editor, James Dao, answers questions about how we handled an essay on the Supreme Court justice and a third accuser.", "authors": ["The New York Times"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/17/pageoneplus/17readers-kavanaugh/17readers-kavanaugh-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
