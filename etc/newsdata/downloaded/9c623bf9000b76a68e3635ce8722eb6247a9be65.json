Central banks are not effectively \"promising\" fiscal expansion, which is \"a whole new narrative\" in markets. \"This has introduced a new safety net under risky assets. Put differently, why would I sell equities today if governments and central banks are about to do a big fiscal expansion financed partly by the central bank balance sheet.\"\n\nThe bottom line: Asset managers and economists have long suggested the Fed and other central banks are overly concerned with stock prices. But, as the chief economist at a major investment bank, Slok is one of the first in his position to allege stock prices could be this influenced by central bank policies.", "description": "A prominent economist says Central bank safety nets could keep stock prices up", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/Zg8f2vI77I9IX-f5B3JSqr_NlxQ=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/10/1570707339509.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
