REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nVolker resigned last week as Trump\u2019s special representative for Ukraine negotiations.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers are examining whether there are grounds to impeach Republican Trump based on a whistleblower\u2019s account that said he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a July 25 phone call to help investigate Democratic political rival Joe Biden.\n\nThe following are descriptions of Volker and four serving U.S. diplomats whom lawmakers have asked to give sworn, closed-door testimony:\n\nKURT VOLKER\n\nVolker left the foreign service a decade ago after a meteoric career that made him the second-ranking U.S. diplomat for Europe at 40 and the U.S. ambassador to the NATO Western security alliance at 43.\n\nCurrent and former U.S. officials described Volker, whose jobs including serving as an aide to the secretary-general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and as a director on the White House national security council, as a talented diplomat.\n\nThey said his rapid rise in George W. Bush\u2019s administration, when he vaulted over older colleagues to become the number two official in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, may have led to his decision to leave the foreign service.\n\nHaving spent only about a year in what one current official called his \u201cdream job\u201d as U.S. ambassador to NATO, Volker was replaced by former President Barack Obama and may have felt there was little reason to stay.\n\n\u201cHe was ... an extremely capable officer who had very good grasp of U.S. foreign policy - especially for the big picture, not just the thing that he was working on,\u201d one official said.\n\nAfter working in the private sector, Volker became head of the McCain Institute for International Leadership at Arizona State University. In 2017, he took an unpaid role as the U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations.\n\nVolker is cited in the whistleblower report as having met Zelenskiy one day after the July 25 call, along with U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, and having provided advice about how to \u201cnavigate\u201d Trump\u2019s demands.\n\nThe report also said Volker and Sondland had spoken to Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to try to \u201ccontain the damage\u201d from what some officials saw as the lawyer\u2019s end run around normal policy-making.\n\nGiuliani has acknowledged meeting Ukrainian officials in Madrid, Paris and Warsaw this year as he pushed an investigation into Biden, a potential Democratic rival of Trump\u2019s in the 2020 presidential election. However, he has told Reuters he did not view his work as a \u201cpolitical act\u201d and said it began in 2018, before Biden had become a candidate.\n\nThe McCain Institute declined comment.\n\nVolker is one of two of the five current and former diplomats who have agreed to speak to the committees, congressional aides said. The other is a former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nMARIE \u201cMASHA\u201d YOVANOVITCH\n\nA three-time U.S. ambassador who has led the U.S. embassies in Armenia, Kyrgyzstan and Ukraine, Yovanovitch\u2019s stint as U.S. ambassador in Kiev was cut short in May, when she was brought back to Washington under murky circumstances.\n\nDescribed by colleagues as a professional to her fingertips, Yovanovitch became the subject of allegations - flatly denied by the State Department - that she gave a Ukrainian prosecutor a list of people not to prosecute.\n\nYovanovitch, a career diplomat, has been accused by Trump allies of criticizing the president to foreign officials, something current and former colleagues found inconceivable.\n\n\u201cThere is zero possibility, absolutely zero possibility, that happened. It cannot possibly be true,\u201d said a current U.S. official who has known Yovanovitch for decades.\n\nWhen Yovanovitch was brought back to the United States, the State Department said she was \u201cconcluding her 3-year diplomatic assignment in Kiev in 2019 as planned\u201d and that her departure date \u201caligns with the presidential transition in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nCurrent and former officials, however, said that Yovanovitch had not been expected to leave Kiev until later in the year and said a presidential transition is precisely when you want an experienced ambassador in place.\n\nYovanovitch agreed to give a deposition on Oct. 11, committee officials said. She could not be reached for comment and the State Department did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nGEORGE KENT\n\nKent, who majored in Russian Language and Literature as an undergraduate at Harvard, is a deputy assistant secretary of state overseeing U.S. policy toward Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan.\n\nThe most junior of the U.S. diplomats who has been asked to address the committees, Kent is a career foreign service officer who has served in Warsaw, Kiev, Tashkent and Bangkok.\n\nHe has also worked as a special assistant to the State Department\u2019s number three official, a demanding but plum job that typically goes to diplomats who are rising fast and often become ambassadors.\n\nKent, a former official said, is steeped in the history and politics of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is anybody in the U.S. government who has a better understanding of the current politics,\u201d said the former official. \u201cHe is the kind of foreign service officer who goes abroad and ... immerses himself in the foreign culture.\u201d\n\nT. ULRICH BRECHBUHL\n\nBrechbuhl, counselor to the secretary of state, has ties to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo going back more than three decades to their time as classmates at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.\n\nBrechbuhl then followed Pompeo into business and to the State Department.\n\nBoth graduated from West Point in 1986 and Brechbuhl, according to his State Department biography, went on to serve as a cavalry officer patrolling the Iron Curtain before its fall and in the First Calvary Division during the Persian Gulf War.\n\nAfter leaving active duty, Brechbuhl received a Masters in Business Administration from Harvard, worked at Bain and Company Inc and joined Pompeo in founding a Kansas-based aerospace company.\n\n\u201cI saw him as the guy who was going to protect Pompeo\u2019s back,\u201d said a former State Department official. However, the former official said he did not regard Brechbuhl - who was born in Switzerland and grew up in Garden City, New York - as \u201cpolitical or ideological.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower report said that Brechbuhl listened in on the July 25 call but a State Department official denied this.\n\nGORDON SONDLAND\n\nThe founder and chief executive of Provenance Hotels, which own or operate 19 boutique hotels, most of which are in the Pacific Northwest, is a political appointee who serves as the U.S. ambassador to the European Union.\n\nThe Brussels-based post typically involves U.S. trade policy and dealing with the EU\u2019s bureaucracy but Sondland has sought to expand its scope, including to such issues as Ukraine.\n\n\u201cOf the political appointees he is serious, he is there to work but he has the disadvantage of working for an administration that is deeply ... anti-EU,\u201d said a former U.S. official.\n\n\u201cWhen I read the (whistleblower) account of what Volker and Sondland were trying to do with the Ukrainians and Giuliani, trying to limit the damage, I found that entirely plausible,\u201d the former official added. \u201cI might have done the same.\u201d\n\nThe State Department did not respond to requests for comment about Yovanovitch, Kent and Sondland.", "description": "Former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker on Thursday became the first of five former and current U.S. diplomats to give a deposition to the congressional committees conducting an impeachment inquiry into U.S. President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Arshad Mohammed", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436747489&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF921KO"}
