It also inhibits big surpluses, but this fair balance is ignored as Holland and Germany drain ever bigger surpluses out of their captive market.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cEU membership means no nationalisation, no state aid to protect jobs, no effective regional policy, no massive deficit financing to stimulate a flagging economy.\n\n\u201cInstead, Britain must continue to be drained and dragged down by a European Union, once dynamic but now on the brink of recession thanks to its German-inspired neo-liberalism. The alternative to breaking out and fighting back is slow, long-term decline into Europe\u2019s consumer of last resort.\u201d\n\nThe former Labour MP continued to make the left-wing case for Brexit by saying that \u201cthe only instrument Labour has found to advance the cause of the people\u201d was under the \u201cdemocratic control\u201d of \u201cthe nation-state\u201d \u2014 an institution being eroded by the globalist-progressive European Union.\n\n\u201cThe nation-state put Britain ahead of Europe in developing labour and union rights and advancing women workers. Even now anything the EU can do (which is little enough), our own government can do better\u201d \u2014 a challenge to Labour-Remain claims that diverging from Brussels will result in a loss of workers\u2019 rights.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve undermined our roots among the workers and in the old industrial areas to become a middle-class party dominated by the interests and aspiration of a dominant middle class which benefits from globalisation, Europeanisation, financialisation, deindustrialisation, and rocketing house prices,\u201d he added.\n\nLabour Votes to Open Borders, Give All Migrants Voting Rights, NHS Access https://t.co/yBpYN6SQsZ \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 26, 2019\n\nLabour has been turning away from its working-class base and embracing the metropolitan elite for decades. After World War Two, the party had kept the UK out of the European Coal and Steel Community, the first iteration of a European \u2018union\u2019; a the 1962 party conference, former Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell opposed Common Market membership; and Labour Party members campaigned against UK membership of the European Economic Community in 1975.\n\nHistorically, several heavy-hitters in the party were strongly Eurosceptic, including Tony Benn, former party leader Michael Foot, and Peter Shore, who delivered the powerful \u201cFear! Fear! Fear!\u201d speech ahead of the 1975 referendum, the memory of which was revived for the 2016 vote as Brexiteers battled against the Remain machine\u2019s own Project Fear.\n\nBrexiteer stalwarts maintained a presence in the party until recently, but they are fast dwindling. Kate Hoey announced in July 2019 that she was standing down at the next election, Frank Field resigned the Labour whip in August 2018 over party antisemitism, and in September 2019 John Mann announced he would be quitting the Commons \u2014 again, over Labour\u2019s antisemitism scandals.\n\nA highly contradictory figure in Labour\u2019s Brexit dialogue is the party\u2019s leader, Jeremy Corbyn. A student of socialist Eurosceptic Tony Benn, Labour Leaver campaigner Brendan Chilton described Mr Corbyn as the \u201cmost Eurosceptic Labour leader since Michael Foot\u201d.\n\nProspect magazine outlined in February Mr Corbyn\u2019s previous anti-EU sentiment thus:\n\nLike his mentor, Tony Benn, Corbyn had been a Eurosceptic since the 1970s. He voted against membership in 1975, opposed Labour\u2019s pro-European turn in the 1980s and condemned the creation of the European Union in 1993 as \u201ca bankers\u2019 Europe\u201d that would \u201cendanger the cause of socialism\u201d. He viewed the EU as an undemocratic, capitalist project that aspired to a \u201cEuropean empire\u201d; a \u201cmilitary Frankenstein\u201d that was \u201csubservient to NATO , \u201d governed by \u201can unelected set of bankers\u201d.\n\nMaking such comments as recently as the last decade, it came as a surprise that in 2016, having been elected as party leader the year before, Mr Corbyn campaigned for Remain. However, the media remarked on his lacklustre battle to keep the UK in the EU.\n\nLabour Chairman: \u2018Left-wing Intellectuals\u2019 Are \u2018Sneering at Ordinary People\u2019 on Brexit https://t.co/acf76Y5hg9 \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 30, 2019\n\nThe June 2016 referendum revealed the divergence of Labour\u2019s political establishment and its voters. While 90 per cent of the party\u2019s MPs voted Remain, 70 per cent of Labour constituencies voted Leave. This disconnect is also present in Corbyn\u2019s top team, which is also heavily London-centric. Sir Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry, Diane Abbott, and John McDonnell all sit for London constituencies. Both Corbyn and Thornberry\u2019s seats are in Islington \u2014 the spiritual capital of London\u2019s metropolitan elite.\n\nPledging to abide by the referendum decision in his 2017 election manifesto, Mr Corbyn betrayed the estimated five million Labour Leavers in the heartlands of the Midlands, Northern England, and Wales when in July 2019 he announced he backed a second referendum. The party voted in favour of a motion to make a second referendum an official Labour position in September.\n\nAfter Mr Corbyn\u2019s statement in July, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage warned that Labour would be \u201cdevastated\u201d in the next election for \u201cbetraying\u201d Labour leavers. A study found last month that that without a natural home, Labour Leavers are more likely to consider voting for the Brexit Party than the Conservatives.", "description": "A former Labour MP has criticised his party's \"absurd enthusiasm\" for the EU, a position he says conflicts with Labour's traditional agenda.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Labour-Stop-Brexit-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
