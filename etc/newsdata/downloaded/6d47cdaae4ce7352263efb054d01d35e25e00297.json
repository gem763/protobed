For July, that number was 82,055. This represents a decline of approximately 22%. Moreover, the August number reflects a decline of 56% since the May peak, which was a staggering 144,255,\" Acting CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan announced.\n\nMorgan released the numbers from the White House and stressed that while new policies are working, there is still a crisis at the border. Congress, which is back in session today after August recess, must change weak asylum laws and stop catch-and-release.\n\n\"President Trump negotiated with Guatemala to have migrants apply for asylum there rather than making the journey to the U.S. Thanks to President Trump\u2019s negotiating, Mexico agreed to step up enforcement at their own borders and stop the flood of migrants from reaching the U.S. Mexico has apprehended about 134,000 people in just the past few months since the U.S. and Mexico reached the agreement. We have expanded the Migrant Protection Protocols to allow more asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their cases proceed. As of September 1st, CBP has returned more than 41,500 individuals to Mexico under MPP,\" the White House released in response to the significant decline.\n\n\"The Administration took action to require asylum seekers to show that they were denied asylum in another country they passed through before reaching the United States. The Administration has worked with Northern Triangle countries to dismantle and disrupt smuggling organizations,\" the statement continues.\n\nIn addition, President Trump continues to tout new construction of border wall in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.\n\n\n\n", "description": ".09/09/2019 19:15:40PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/14/d8756002-ceef-490e-8e1c-4946d3d7f9b6.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
