She was snapped in NYC last year\n\n'It's going to be on my birthday ... and I'm going to be celebrating my birthday with 100 million people; a small party,' the Colombian singer said on the program. 'I've always wanted to perform at the Super Bowl. I think it's like the holy grail of the entertainment industry.\n\n'It's a sports event, but it has a huge relevance for us artists, and I think it's going to be fantastic.'\n\nShakira said the turn of events was 'kind of surreal' after the halftime show's producer, Jay-Z, contacted her to see if she was interested in the high-profile gig.\n\n'He called me, and he asked me if I wanted to be a part of that,' she said. 'And of course I didn't hesitate. I said, \"Of course, count on me.\"'\n\nPromotional trail: The Hips Don't Lie artist appeared Monday on Zane Lowe's Beats Radio 1 program on Apple Music to plug her new song Tutu\n\nDynamic duo: Shakira said that she and J.Lo represent key sections of the Latin community\n\nThe Hips Don't Lie stunner said that she and J.Lo represent key sections of the Latin community.\n\n'I feel that it's going to be great because she also represents a really important part of the Latino community who lives in the U.S., and who has been born and raised in the U.S.,' Shakira said. 'And I think in a way, I feel that I'm representing another part of the Latin world, which is all those people around the globe who almost barely speak English.\n\n'And a huge portion of the demographic that also arrived in the U.S. and live the American dream.'\n\nThe Whenever, Wherever artist added she believed the show was 'going to be an event to celebrate Latin culture and the importance of women also in the industry.'\n\nNo thanks: Rihanna revealed last week that she turned down performing at the Super Bowl earlier this year, amid her support for quarterback Colin Kaepernick\n\nShakira's remarks come in the wake of Rihanna's recent remarks to Vogue that she passed on the high-profile gig earlier this year out of her disagreements with the NFL and the ongoing situation swirling over quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who has been out of a job the past three seasons after kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality in 2016.\n\n'I just couldn\u2019t be a sellout,' she told the outlet. 'I couldn\u2019t be an enabler ... I couldn\u2019t dare do that.'\n\nRihanna said she saw no benefit in performing in the halftime show, which Maroon 5 subsequently played.\n\n'For what? Who gains from that? Not my people,' she said. 'There\u2019s things within that organization that I do not agree with at all, and I was not about to go and be of service to them in any way.'", "description": "The singer will turn 43 on February 2, 2020, which marks the date of Super Bowl LIV at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium, where she's slated to perform with Jennifer Lopez at halftime.", "authors": ["Adam S.
