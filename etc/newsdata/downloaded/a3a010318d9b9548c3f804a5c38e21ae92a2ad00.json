The song has been watched on YouTube nearly 800,000 times, and at least half a dozen English translations, and a Japanese iteration, have surfaced.\n\nThe composer is Thomas, a full-time musician in his mid-twenties who asked to be identified only by his first name. He says he recruited performers, as well as people to help with the mixing and arrangement, on Hong Kong\u2019s Reddit-like forum LIHKG, after sharing a demo version last month.\n\n\u201cMusic is a tool for unity,\u201d he tells TIME. \u201cI really felt like we needed a song to unite us and boost our morale.\u201d\n\nWhile he wrote the first draft of the lyrics, LIHKG users contributed suggestions in a thread that was upvoted more than a thousand times. One of them was the incorporation of \u201cReclaim Hong Kong, revolution of our time,\u201d which has become one of the most commonly chanted phrases at pro-democracy protests.\n\n\u201cThe message to listeners is that despite the unhappiness and uncertainty of our time, Hong Kong people will not surrender,\u201d the composer says.\n\nProtesters sing songs and shout slogans as they gather at Cityplaza shopping center after business hours in Hong Kong on Sep. 9, 2019.

While some protestors don\u2019t agree with the label due to its implications with the controversial idea of separatism, all believe the song reflects the trials and tribulations of the now three months-long movement.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first song to be taken up during Hong Kong\u2019s anti-government demonstrations. At the start of the current wave of protests, Christians and non-Christians alike would break into choruses of \u201cSing Hallelujah to the Lord\u201d during peaceful gatherings and tense police stand-offs.\n\n\u201cDo You Hear the People Sing,\u201d from Les Miserables, commonly sung during the 2014 Umbrella Revolution, also continues to be intoned today. Last week, students at a high school sang the Broadway tune over the Chinese national anthem, as seen in a video widely shared on social media.\n\nBut no other song has gained the traction that \u201cGlory to Hong Kong\u201d has.\n\n\u201cThe song gives me a very strong sense of belonging to Hong Kong,\u201d says Calvin, a 18-year-old protestor. \u201d It summarizes our hopes, our targets, our ambitions.\u201d\n\nA recent local survey has shown that only about a quarter of those polled identified themselves as \u201cChinese,\u201d while more than half identified themselves as \u201cHongkongers.\u201d The former British colony was retroceded to China in 1997, but its 7.2 million inhabitants remain culturally and linguistically distinct from mainland Chinese.\n\nWrite to Hillary Leung at hillary.leung@time.com.", "description": "Written by a young musician, with crowd-sourced lyrics, the song is being hailed as a \"national anthem\" by the protest movement.", "authors": ["Hillary Leung", "Hong Kong"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/gettyimages-1166745252.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
