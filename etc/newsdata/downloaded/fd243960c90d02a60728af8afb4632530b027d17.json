Hint: It\u2019s kind of like spidey-sense, but for mere mortals:\n\nAs a prosecutor, I was taught that when a witness looks down & to the right as they answer, it\u2019s a signal they are not being truthful. https://t.co/itbKOztvET \u2014 Joyce Alene (@JoyceWhiteVance) October 27, 2019\n\nHey, it works on children!\n\nYes. Prosecutorial training made it tough on my kids during the teenage years. Favorite overheard older brother to younger brother comment: \u201cwhy would you try to lie to a woman who puts people in jail for a living?\u201d \u2014 Joyce Alene (@JoyceWhiteVance) October 27, 2019\n\nDid she look down and to the right when she typed this tweet, because she\u2019s getting called out:\n\nI was a prosecutor and no one I ever worked with, ( SDNY and Calif) ever said this or believed it I saw a lot of liars in my 37+yr career and this is just hogwash #Liars \u2014 Kim Seefeld (@KAS_SB) October 27, 2019\n\nBut we\u2019re unimpressed:\n\nJunk science alert https://t.co/yYv59rSN4X \u2014 Robby Soave (@robbysoave) October 27, 2019\n\nEnjoy the mockery MSNBC lady:\n\nI've heard that if you dunk the suspect in a deep well of water, and they drown, it means they're\n\nnot a witch. I hope somebody gave this prosecutor's cases a good look. https://t.co/pvKA9Iwo2q \u2014 Gabriel Malor (@gabrielmalor) October 27, 2019\n\nAs a warlock, I was taught that when a child coughs, it means his soul is trying to escape and will be easy to capture https://t.co/cTNxfBV3Xl \u2014 Jesse Singal (@jessesingal) October 27, 2019\n\nDid you really just say that publicly? I also heard that if they tug their left ear, the defense attorney will steal second base https://t.co/Dp4ZLctj7w \u2014 Jim Hanson (@JimHansonDC) October 27, 2019\n\nAs a prosecutor, I was taught that when a witness was born under a rising moon and Venus is in the twelfth house, it\u2019s a signal they are not being truthful. https://t.co/u0oP1S5EGf \u2014 BAGEL (Jewish muffin) (@RafiLetzter) October 27, 2019\n\nShe also employs phrenologists to testify as experts in criminal trials. https://t.co/eXIoOdnfWP \u2014 Mo Mo (@molratty) October 27, 2019\n\ndo Resistance with Cop Mindset Psychology Hacks, now available as a 3 DVD set for $89.95 https://t.co/qd2XRGedc2 \u2014 Patrick Blanchfield (@PatBlanchfield) October 27, 2019\n\nAnd this is why you should never speak to the police without a lawyer present:\n\nThe sort of pseudo-science I'd expect from the worst of TIX training, not from a former (8-year) US Attorney. Good reminder on the dangers of speaking to police or prosecutors w/o a lawyer.https://t.co/QQajwK9NF5 \u2014 KC Johnson (@kcjohnson9) October 27, 2019\n\n***", "description": "\"...this is just hogwash.\"", "authors": ["Greg P.", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/5b8af823-72ec-48ec-83de-e02f667b08fc.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
