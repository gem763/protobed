No dirty tactic was not employed \u2014 it was not a pretty kind of six weeks,\" said Kapelos, the host of CBC's Power & Politics, who spent the campaign watching the action in the war rooms of the major parties.\n\n\"I think you saw a bit of that manifest through the lack of communication that resulted in Mr. Singh, Mr. Scheer and Mr. Trudeau all giving their speeches last night at the same time.\"\n\nOnce the results of the polls become clear, party leaders will typically call the victor and discuss when they will make their public speeches, with the winning leader speaking last.\n\nBut on Monday night, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, who spoke first in B.C., had not finished his speech when Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer took to the stage in Saskatchewan. Only a couple of minutes into Scheer's speech, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau began his.\n\nNot exactly the collaboration I had in mind... \ud83e\udd14 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/elxn43?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#elxn43</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/cdnpoli?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#cdnpoli</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/scxLZumlBm\">pic.twitter.com/scxLZumlBm</a> \u2014@brad_barrett\n\n\"I think we all kind of had our jaw drop, that is not normal in any way,\" Kapelos told The Current's interim host Laura Lynch.\n\n\"I am going to be fascinated, I think, to see how these parties are able to work together.\"\n\nConservatives take popular vote\n\nThe Liberals won 157 seats, and are expected to form a minority government. The Conservatives won the popular vote, but finished with 121 seats. The Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois finished with 32; the NDP with 24.\n\nBy losing the popular vote, pollster Shachi Kurl said that Trudeau \"has a mandate in terms of seats in the House, but didn't really come first in the hearts of Canadians.\"\n\n\"How do you navigate a national agenda with a country as fractured and divided as it appears to be?\" said Kurl, executive director of the not-for-profit polling organization Angus Reid Institute.\n\n\"And how do you do it with a government and a prime minister who last night delivered a speech acting as though he had been handed back a majority mandate, but in fact lost the popular vote?\"\n\nWatch results from our Canada Votes election night special. 23:46\n\nThe Conservatives won every seat \u2014 except one \u2014 in Alberta and Saskatchewan, ousting all Liberal incumbents, including former minister of public safety Ralph Goodale.\n\nNo Liberals in Alberta a 'challenge'\n\nPolitical scientist Daniel B\u00e9land says that leaves the Liberals with a problem.\n\n\"Not having any Albertan at the Cabinet table, I think is a challenge,\" said B\u00e9land, director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada.\n\nHe told Lynch it's \"one of the many regional, territorial challenges that I think this minority government will face.\"\n\nNot having any Albertan at the Cabinet table, I think is a challenge. - Daniel B\u00e9land\n\nDespite that, he thinks the parties have a \"strong incentive\" for the party leaders to make the minority government work.\n\n\"Canadians don't want to go back to the polls anytime soon \u2014 we know that, the parties know that,\" he said.\n\nIt's up to the leaders to make it work so that \"Canadians don't punish them for \u2026 going back to the polls early on.\"\n\nWritten by Padraig Moran.
