Robert Francis O\u2019Rourke has gone so over the cliff in his leftist-speak that even Al Sharpton and Wolf Blitzer are trying to toss him a lifeline back to reality. Case in point \u2013 in interviews a mere day apart, O\u2019Rourke referred to President Trump and his administration as Nazis. That\u2019s not a particularly original thought emanating from the left these days but O\u2019Rourke even brought Goebbels into the conversation.\n\nIn today\u2019s Trump deranged world, standard references to Hitler are not enough when talking about the Republican president or his administration. Remember when the left popularized Hitler references during the George W. Bush administration? Back then it was Bushitler. Trump\u2019s name isn\u2019t so easy to work with so the incendiary remarks spring forward.\n\nO\u2019Rourke hasn\u2019t been able to top the attention he received after the mass shooting in El Paso and his decision to make gun-grabbing legislation his campaign\u2019s main theme. Now he just swings for the fences and hopes someone will book him on cable television. One show that took the bait was Rev. Al Sharpton\u2019s Sunday show. During his interview on MSNBC\u2019s PoliticsNation, O\u2019Rourke included the name of Adolph Hitler\u2019s propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels in his criticism of President Trump.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump, perhaps inspired by Goebbels and the propagandists of the Third Reich, seems to employ this tactic that the bigger the lie, the more obscene the injustice, the more dizzying the pace of this bizarre behavior, the less likely we are to be able to do something about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful that not only is the House moving forward with impeachment, but\u2026 It\u2019s a good sign that he was caught, that he was stopped \u2014 that he can no longer normalize the behavior that we\u2019ve seen so far.\u201d\n\nThe King of Race Baiters and anti-Semitic Sharpton was surprised by O\u2019Rourke\u2019s rhetoric. Rev. Al asked for clarification. \u201cDid I hear you correctly say that perhaps Trump was influenced by Goebbels and the Third Reich in terms of telling a big lie? I just want to make sure that\u2019s what I heard you say.\u201d\n\nTalking Trump and more w/ 2020 Presidential candidate Beto O\u2019rourke on #PoliticsNation. pic.twitter.com/MdkghL1MSv \u2014 Reverend Al Sharpton (@TheRevAl) October 20, 2019\n\nI\u2019ll note the irony in O\u2019Rourke claiming that President Trump is \u201cnormalizing\u201d some type of behavior. That is exactly what the left has done against Republicans and conservatives. They have normalized using words like \u201cNazi\u201d against them. The left always accuses the right of actions they are taking.\n\nSo, that was Sunday. On Monday, while giving an interview to CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer, O\u2019Rourke forged on. He defended his use of the \u2018N\u2019 word. It\u2019s really all about the Muslims, or maybe Mexicans, or something.\n\nCNN anchor Wolf Blitzer asked O\u2019Rourke if he was going too far in comparing Trump to the Nazis. But O\u2019Rourke didn\u2019t back down. \u201cFind me a better analogy of another leader of a Western democracy describing all people of one religion as inherently defective or disqualified or dangerous,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the president has done when it comes to Muslims.\u201d O\u2019Rourke continued on with more past comments of the president. \u201cRepeating the lie that Mexican immigrants pose violent risk to this country,\u201d O\u2019Rourke added. \u201cAsking four women of color elected by their constituents to Congress to go back to their home country. And having an almost Nuremberg-like rally where people are chanting \u2018Send her back\u2019 or inviting the kind of violence based on the racism that he\u2019s inspired where you have another crowd cheering when someone says \u2018shoot them\u2019 when the president says what do we do about these immigrants.\u201d\n\nOh, did you catch that little nugget in that screed? Those Trump rallies that include chanting like \u201cSend her back\u201d are \u201cNuremberg-like\u201d rallies and incite violence. Orange Man bad and so are his Deplorables. They are just like Nazis.\n\nBlitzer asked if O\u2019Rourke understands the impact such language will have on people and how offensive it is for him to insert words like Holocaust and Nazis in a political conversation. \u201cMost people say that is unacceptable,\u201d Blitzer said. Alas, Beto doesn\u2019t care about any of that. He simply has to make such comparisons, as it\u2019s his last resort, you see. And it is \u201cwhere we are.\u201d He told Blitzer that the country is descending into \u201copen racism, intolerance and violence led by the president.\u201d Also, yes, Trump is a Russian asset. \u201cHe\u2019s working in the interests of Russia and defying the interests of the United States,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. The man left no stone unturned, right?\n\nRobert Francis O\u2019Rourke has not qualified for the November debate yet. He told Blitzer that he\u2019ll stay in the race whether he makes it to the debate stage or not. Raising money isn\u2019t his problem (who are these people, anyway?), it\u2019s his poor polling. He has failed to hit 3 percent in at least four recognized polls. Beto\u2019s campaign sent out an email Sunday sounding the alarm that \u201cmillions of people\u201d may not get to hear his message. Thank heavens for small blessings is what I say to that.\n\nI don\u2019t think O\u2019Rourke should count on any of this latest nonsense to raise his numbers in the polls. It can\u2019t come soon enough for when we\u2019ll be able to say, \u201cAdios, Beto.\u201d", "description": "Normalizing behavior", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/BetoDebate.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
