The focus of the investigation was not immediately apparent.\n\nRepresentatives from the U.S. attorney\u2019s office and Juul, both of which are based in San Francisco, did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nNews of the probe comes amid increasing government scrutiny of Juul and other e-cigarette manufacturers as teenagers\u2019 use of their addictive products soars in the U.S.\n\nNorth Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein filed a lawsuit against Juul in May, accusing the company of knowingly marketing its products to minors and downplaying the health risks associated with vaping.\n\nA congressional subcommittee in July accused Juul of waging a \u201csophisticated\u201d campaign to target teenagers and children at schools and summer camps with its marketing and sales efforts.\n\n\u201cIn deploying this out-of-school program, JUUL was aware that its programs were \u2018eerily similar\u2019 to those used by large cigarette makers, and even internal executives raised concerns about their work in schools,\u201d stated a memo released by Democrats on the House Oversight and Reform Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission is also investigating Juul\u2019s marketing practices, while the Food and Drug Administration last week announced that its criminal investigations unit was looking into the rise of vaping-related lung illnesses. President Donald Trump said earlier this month that he had asked the FDA to consider taking flavored e-cigarette products off the market.\n\nE-cigarettes are the most commonly used form of tobacco among youth in the U.S. A 2017 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey found that more than 2 million high school and middle school students vaped.\n\nAnd although e-cigarettes contain fewer toxic chemicals than traditional tobacco products, they often include more nicotine, the addictive drug found in regular cigarettes, cigars and other tobacco products.\n\nVaping has been linked to at least nine deaths and roughly 530 cases of illness. Common symptoms that patients have experienced include breathing issues, dry cough or chest pain, and in some cases, diarrhea, vomiting and fever. The majority of those sickened have been male and between the ages of 18 and 34, according to the CDC. Roughly 16% have been younger than 18.\n\nThe CDC announced earlier this month that it was investigating the matter.\n\nJuul suspended sales of most of its flavored e-cigarette pods in retail stores last year, prompting the FDA to back down on a proposed ban on fruit- and candy-flavored e-cigarettes in convenience stores and gas stations. This June, San Francisco\u2019s board of supervisors voted to effectively ban the sale of e-cigarettes starting next year. Kevin Burns, Juul\u2019s CEO, apologized to parents of young e-cigarette users in a CNBC documentary, \u201cVaporized: America\u2019s E-Cigarette Addiction,\u201d that aired in July. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that their child is using the product. It\u2019s not intended for them,\u201d Burns said. \u201cAs a parent to a 16-year-old, I\u2019m sorry for them and have empathy for them and the challenges that they\u2019re going through.\u201d", "description": "The e-cigarette maker is under increasing scrutiny as the death toll linked to vaping rises.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8953e02100005d00db6adb.jpeg?cache=jfsje3mwub&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
