And if Microsoft is right, users who get the update should experience fewer glitches than in the past.\n\nMicrosoft suggests these additional 35 PC health signals have delivered results. It claimed major reductions in stability issues and driver clashes in Windows 10 1803.\n\nNow the researchers say PCs chosen via ML have fewer than half the number of system-initiated uninstalls, half the number of kernel mode crashes, and five times fewer post-update driver issues.\n\n\"Machine learning helps us detect potential issues more quickly and helps us decide the best time to update each PC once a new version of Windows is available,\" the data scientists write.\n\nSEE: Microsoft: We want you to learn Python programming language for free\n\nThe pair also explain how Microsoft is using Windows Insider testers to improve the experience for other users. Once these users update, Microsoft monitors diagnostic data for kernel-mode crashes, system-initiated uninstalls, abnormal shutdowns, driver issues, and other health signals.\n\nML allows Microsoft to identify issues and potentially implement a block and to protect PCs that haven't updated yet, allowing Microsoft to contain the problem while it investigates. The model also \"predicts and nominates PCs that will have a seamless update experience and should, thus, be offered the update\".\n\nHowever, a recent run of bugs affecting Insiders and then general users shows this process still misses some things, even when Windows Insiders actually report the bugs.\n\nThe blog post is more focused on the benefits and challenges of building an ML model for assisting with operating system updates. Microsoft used to rely more heavily on humans to test updates before they were released but the company fired significant number of them in 2014 as part of the Nokia purge.\n\nMore on Microsoft and Windows 10 updates", "description": "Microsoft reckons its machine-learning models are improving the Windows 10 upgrade experience.", "authors": ["Liam Tung"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/27/9227be30-04a5-43ea-9f79-b9ab0e72e68e/thumbnail/770x578/9704a47344ccd09681585502222537bb/manlaptopistock-639105488.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
