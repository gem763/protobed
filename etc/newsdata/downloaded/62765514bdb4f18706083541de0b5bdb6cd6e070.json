Kendi has daring, novel ideas about racism \u2014 and how to fight it", "language": "en", "text": "Ibram H. Rogers, 17, hadn\u2019t even told his parents that he was entering a Martin Luther King Jr. Day oratorical contest. They found out after he won one of the early rounds and they got a videotape of his performance. \u201cWe\u2019ll never forget that Saturday morning we put the tape in and watched him,\u201d Larry Rogers, Ibram\u2019s father, told me recently. \u201cWe were really surprised.\u201d Ibram was a bright but underachieving senior at his Northern Virginia high school. His GPA was below 3.0; his SAT scores were just above 1000. He thought he wasn\u2019t smart enough for college, even though he had been admitted to historically black Florida A&M University.\n\nThe Prince William County Alumnae Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, sponsor of the competition, saw to it that the finale, in January 2000, was filled with pride. The MLK Community Choir serenaded the mostly African American audience of 3,000 that filled a local chapel. \u201cIt was a very proud moment,\u201d recalls Carol Rogers, Ibram\u2019s mother. \u201cAn awesome event.\u201d Six students out of more than 100 contestants made it to the final round to deliver 10-minute speeches on \u201cDr. King\u2019s Message for the Millennium.\u201d\n\nThe contestants dressed like young business people \u2014 except Ibram, who wore a loud golden-brown blazer, black shirt, bright tie and baggy pants. (The fact that the public school he represented, Stonewall Jackson High School, was named for a Confederate general was one of those ironies that, in the moment, was too deep to dwell on.) For his speech, Ibram adopted the persona of an angry King come back to life to scold black youth for thinking \u201cthat the cultural revolution that began on the day of my dream\u2019s birth is over. ... How can it be over when kids know more about Puff Daddy than they know about me? ... How can it be over when many times we are unsuccessful because we lack intestinal fortitude?\u201d The speech swelled into a jeremiad of disappointment. Ibram paced around the pulpit as he reeled off more supposed failings of young black people: \u201cThey think it\u2019s okay to be those who are most feared in our society! ... They think it\u2019s okay not to think! ... They think it\u2019s okay to confine their dreams to sports and music!\u201d\n\nThe audience loved the message, reacting with \u201cwhoops of agreement,\u201d according to a Washington Post account at the time. Ibram didn\u2019t win the top prize, but, two days after the big night, a picture of him speaking was spread over three columns in The Post, with the headline: \u201cStudents Give New Voice to King\u2019s Dream.\u201d\n\nIbram H. Rogers has grown up to be Ibram X. Kendi, 37, a leading voice among a new generation of American scholars who are reinvestigating \u2014 and redefining \u2014 racism. In 2016, at 34, he became one of the youngest authors to win the National Book Award for nonfiction, for \u201cStamped From the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America\u201d \u2014 which, gushed the award judges, \u201cturns our ideas of the term \u2018racism\u2019 upside-down.\u201d The following year, American University recruited him from the University of Florida to join the faculty and create the Antiracist Research & Policy Center. (The very evening in September 2017 when Kendi introduced the center at a gathering of students, faculty and administrators, someone stuck cotton balls to fliers depicting Confederate flags and posted them around campus.) More recently, the crowds turning out to hear Kendi discuss his new bestseller, \u201cHow to Be an Antiracist,\u201d have been so large that bookstores have resorted to holding readings in churches, synagogues and school auditoriums.\n\nKendi\u2019s ideas \u2014 that few, if any, are free of racism; that we should confess to our own racism as a first step toward becoming anti-racist; that racism begins not with the prejudice of individuals but with the policies of political and economic power \u2014 are bracing and challenging. They also constitute a very different take on race from the speech he gave at 17. For years afterward, he had vague memories of his MLK oration, and they were troubling. The competition, he told me, had been \u201ca pivotal moment in my life\u201d \u2014 one that gave him the confidence to believe that he was college material after all and that his future would involve communicating ideas to a larger public. Yet he also recalled how, a couple of years ago, when he took the time to watch his performance on a DVD that his father had made, \u201cI cringed and was completely ashamed.\u201d\n\nThe speech, he saw, had been a litany of blame, implying that there was something wrong with young African Americans as a group and that they could conquer white racism by behaving differently. How did these perspectives get lodged in the young orator\u2019s brain? Why did the African American crowd respond with such enthusiasm? To his chagrin, Kendi realized his own experience was a prime example of how racist ideas quietly worm their way through the culture. It also showed all too clearly how one can be anti-racist in some contexts yet sick with racism in others.\n\nReflecting on the shame he felt at his words, he realized that the best way to communicate his newest message would be to hold out his journey as an example. Whereas his previous book, \u201cStamped From the Beginning,\u201d had been built around five historical characters \u2014 Cotton Mather, Thomas Jefferson, William Lloyd Garrison, W.E.B. Du Bois and Angela Davis \u2014 he reluctantly concluded that his next book, \u201cHow to Be an Antiracist,\u201d must be based on the errors and evolution of Ibram X. Kendi.\n\nI think even the book got better after his diagnosis,\u201d says Kendi\u2019s wife, Sadiqa. \u201cI think he was writing for his life.\n\n\u201cInitially, I was like, that central character will not be me,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019m too private. I don\u2019t want to show all of my bones and all of my baggage and all those shameful moments that I\u2019m still ashamed of. I don\u2019t know \u2014 I don\u2019t want to do that. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized: How can I ask other people to share those shameful moments, to free themselves of their baggage, to confess the most racist moments of their lives, if I\u2019m not willing to do that, too?\u201d\n\nAnd so his work and his life have built to this moment of invitation to his readers, his audiences, America. After a precocious scholarly career spent demonstrating the depressing pervasiveness of racism, he stands uncommonly hopeful, inviting us onto a path forward. \u201cWe know how to be racist,\u201d he writes. \u201cWe know how to pretend to be not racist. Now let\u2019s know how to be antiracist.\u201d\n\nRecently, Kendi\u2019s life and work have fused in another way, too \u2014 this one potentially tragic. In January 2018, after having drafted about five chapters of \u201cHow to Be an Antiracist,\u201d he received a diagnosis of Stage 4 colon cancer. About 88 percent of people in that condition die within five years, he was told.\n\nKendi was devastated but still detached enough to fold his illness into his work. He began to make sense of racism through cancer, and to make sense of cancer through racism \u2014 essentially seeing both as diseases that can be systematically fought. He wrote through months of chemotherapy and recovery from surgery, taking naps when he was too weak to remain at his keyboard, then awakening to write some more. \u201cI was like, you know what, I want to finish this book before I die,\u201d he told me. Sadiqa Kendi, his wife, a pediatric emergency medicine doctor at Children\u2019s National Hospital in Washington, kept watch to see that at least he didn\u2019t work himself to death. \u201cI think even the book got better after his diagnosis,\u201d she says. \u201cI think he was writing for his life.\u201d\n\n\n\nKendi\u200b speaks about his new book, \u201cHow to Be an Antiracist,\u201d at the Atlantic Festival in September. (Photograph by Michael A. McCoy)\n\nHave you noticed that almost everyone self-identifies as \u201cnot racist\u201d? Consider: In June, responding to backlash over his fond recollections of working with segregationists in the Senate in the 1970s, Joe Biden insisted, \u201cThere\u2019s not a racist bone in my body.\u201d The following month, in response to backlash over his attacks on four women of color in Congress, President Trump tweeted, \u201cI don\u2019t have a Racist bone in my body!\u201d\n\nKendi has little use for such protestations, for two reasons. First, he thinks \u201cracist\u201d should be treated as a plain, descriptive term for policies and ideas that create or justify racial inequities, not a personal attack. Someone is being racist when he or she endorses a racist idea or policy. Second, he doesn\u2019t acknowledge \u201cnot racist\u201d as a category. At all times, people are being either racist or anti-racist; in Kendi\u2019s view, \u201cthere is no in-between safe space of \u2018not racist.\u2019 \u201d Through his scholarship, Kendi has traced nearly six centuries of racist and anti-racist ideas. He could not do the same for \u201cnot racist.\u201d It\u2019s an identity without content.\n\nAll policies, even the most trivial, are either racist or anti-racist, he argues \u2014 they support equity or they don\u2019t. A do-nothing approach to climate change is racist because climate change overwhelmingly affects people of color on the planet. Forgiving student debt and offering universal health care would be anti-racist policies because people of color are more likely to have student debt or lack health care, so those policies would lessen if not erase those inequities.\n\nIn Kendi\u2019s analysis, everyone, every day, through action or inaction, speech or silence, is choosing in the moment to be racist or anti-racist. It follows, then, that those identities are fluid, and racism is not a fixed character flaw. \u201cWhat we say about race, what we do about race, in each moment, determines what \u2014 not who \u2014 we are,\u201d he writes. In studying the history of racist ideas, Kendi has found the same person saying racist and anti-racist things in the same speech. \u201cWe change, and we\u2019re deeply complex, and our definitions of \u2018racist\u2019 and \u2018anti-racist\u2019 must reflect that,\u201d he told me. Those who aspire to anti-racism will, when accused of racism, seriously consider the charge and take corrective action. They will not claim to lack any racist bones. \u201cThe heartbeat of racism is denial,\u201d he writes in his new book. \u201cThe heartbeat of antiracism is confession. ... Only racists shy away from the R-word.\u201d\n\nAs for where racism comes from: A popular explanation for the gen\u00adesis of racism assumes that people\u2019s ignorance and hatred harden into racist ideas, which lead to racist policies. \u201cBut that gets the chain of events exactly wrong,\u201d Kendi writes. From slavery to Jim Crow, from redlining to mass incarceration to the unequal distribution of government largesse, power has been the first link in the chain. Power, he argues, devises racist policies for economic self-interest and then justifies the racist policies with racist ideas of hierarchy, inferiority, necessity, greater good and otherness. These racist ideas are consumed and reproduced at large, giving rise to ignorance and hate. Stop focusing on people, Kendi advises: The smart anti-racist identifies racist policy and attacks the racist ideas justifying it.\n\nContemporary thinkers on race say Kendi\u2019s approach represents a bold extension of previous work on the subject. Molefi Kete Asante, who in 1988 created the nation\u2019s first PhD program in African American studies at Temple University (where Kendi got his doctorate in 2010), told me he recalls when Kendi returned to campus in February and presented his idea that racism begins with policies. \u201cI remember how shocked we were when we first heard him lecture on that, and people, you know, had to go back and reread [his argument] to figure out how he does this work,\u201d Asante says. \u201cI think it\u2019s a wonderful innovation. ... There were questions, and he defended himself quite well.\u201d Kendi, he adds, \u201cis really the ascendant African American intellectual of his time. ... He has attempted something that is in the Afrocentric tradition ... and that is: Let\u2019s redo almost everything. Let\u2019s look at everything and ask ourselves the question, What if we turned it upside down?\u201d\n\nKendi\u2019s contention that racist policies spur the creation of racist ideas, not the other way around, is not fully embraced by all scholars, including his doctoral adviser at Temple, Ama Mazama, professor of Africology. \u201cI don\u2019t think that the power of ideas can necessarily be minimized,\u201d she says. \u201cIt would be great, like he suggests, if we want to do away with racism, we could have anti-racist policies. ... I\u2019m not sure if it would work. ... Maybe too much damage has already been done, too much ignorance that would be very difficult to eradicate through anti-racist policies.\u201d Still, she is proud of her \u201cbrilliant\u201d former student: \u201cHis work is important. ... He\u2019s also looking for solutions. It\u2019s not just an intellectual exercise, it\u2019s something much more than that.\u201d\n\nMembers of Kendi\u2019s own generation of scholars praise his ability to break through to a wider audience. It certainly helps that his writing is lyrically accessible. (Two years ago, Kendi contributed a short piece to a special issue of The Washington Post Magazine, in which he proposed an anti-bigotry constitutional amendment.) \u201cI think it\u2019s just astonishing that someone is able to have an intellectual history like \u2018Stamped From the Beginning\u2019 influence so many people\u2019s thinking about understanding the undercurrents of white supremacy in the United States and its durability over such a long period of time, and then pivot to actually spending time with people to rethink the strategies of their own choices in their own life,\u201d says Marcia Chatelain, associate professor of history and African American studies at Georgetown University, who, after the 2014 police shooting and subsequent protests in Ferguson, Mo., organized scholars to develop the Ferguson Syllabus, a curriculum aimed at digging into the marginalization of black and brown communities. \u201cIbram represents a generation that I see myself as part of where we take our ideas in a number of places and we take the feedback from a number of audiences, and we really struggle and grapple with how our work isn\u2019t just confined by the traditions of academia, but is really defined by its ability to resonate in people\u2019s lives and help them to move closer to the types of worlds that people have long imagined but never realized.\u201d\n\nAt all times, in Kendi\u2019s view, people are being racist or anti-racist; \u201cthere is no in-between safe space of \u2018not racist.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOne of Kendi\u2019s early racial memories is from when he was 7 and his parents brought him to check out a private school on Long Island where he might attend third grade. The family, including Kendi\u2019s older brother, Akil, lived in Queens at the time, but Carol and Larry Rogers were looking to send their children to a school outside the neighborhood. It was after school hours and the third-grade teacher, an African American woman, met them at the door. Are you the only black teacher? Ibram asked with uncomfortable directness. She was. Why are you the only black teacher?\n\n\u201cThe beauty about being 7 years old is that chances are we\u2019re not hypocritical, chances are we\u2019re not filled with contradictions, and chances are we see the world for what is in the world,\u201d Kendi told me, recalling the moment, which he also describes in \u201cHow to Be an Antiracist.\u201d He credits his parents with anchoring him at an early age with enough pride in being black to make such an observation. Both rose from poverty to the new black middle class and had been inspired by the Black Power movement of the 1960s. His mother became a business analyst for a health-care organization, and his father became a tax accountant and later a hospital chaplain. As committed Christians, they were steeped in black liberation theology. They gave Ibram piles of books from a junior series on black achievers, which he devoured.\n\nKendi\u2019s mother tried to explain all this about her son to the taken-aback teacher at the school, but they ended up not sending him there anyway. Instead, Kendi went to another school, where his third-grade teacher was white, and he engaged in his first anti-racist protest: After the teacher ignored the raised hand of one of his black classmates, and called on a white student yet again, Ibram sat in the school\u2019s chapel and refused to return to class. The principal was summoned, and his parents were called.\n\n\u201cWe tried to raise both of our sons, Akil and Ibram, to think for themselves, and if they want to challenge authority, then they have to be willing to suffer the consequences,\u201d Carol Rogers told me. (Akil is now an event specialist for Sam\u2019s Club in Florida, where Carol and Larry Rogers are retired.) Such was the anti-racist path his parents set Ibram on from an early age, but it\u2019s a deceptively hard one on which to keep your footing. \u201cHow to Be an Antiracist\u201d takes the form of a memoir, with Kendi interspersing his experiences with analyses of types of racism that he has found in himself: ethnic racism, bodily racism, behavioral racism, cultural racism, color racism, class racism, gender racism and queer racism. It\u2019s hard to believe one person \u2014 let alone a scholar of racism \u2014 could have encompassed so much bigotry, but that\u2019s Kendi\u2019s point: Anyone can.\n\nIn college at Florida A&M, he wore honey-colored contact lenses for a time, until he realized this was a form of racism, privileging a look associated with another race. He dated a light-skinned woman, until he realized what a warped sensation this was causing among some of his friends, who wished they were dating light-skinned women, too. He dropped her and vowed to date only dark-skinned women \u2014 until he realized this was an equally twisted obsession, driven by racist colorism. During another phase in college, he determined that the problem with white people was that if they were not devils, maybe they were just plain destructive by nature \u2014 until he realized judging white people as a group is as racist as judging black people as a group.\n\nHe came to see in retrospect that even his parents had sometimes strayed from the anti-racist path. Like others in the black middle class, he writes, \u201cMy parents \u2014 even from within their racial consciousness \u2014 were susceptible to the racist idea that it was laziness that kept Black people down, so they paid more attention to Black people than to [President] Reagan\u2019s policies, which were chopping the ladder they climbed up and then punishing people for falling. ... Americans have long been trained to see the deficiencies of people rather than policy.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe one person \u2014 let alone a scholar of racism \u2014 could have encompassed so much bigotry, but that\u2019s Kendi\u2019s point: Anyone can.\n\nKendi is harder on no one than himself. \u201cI arrived at Temple as a racist, sexist homophobe,\u201d he writes of the dawn of his graduate school career. His most important mentors in shedding those views \u2014 in learning how racism, sexism and homophobia intersect \u2014 were fellow graduate students Yaba Blay and Kaila Adia Story. \u201cI learned from them that I am not a defender of Black people if I am not sharply defending Black women, if I am not sharply defending queer Blacks,\u201d he writes. They held court in one of the common areas during study breaks and sent him scurrying to bookshelves for works by Audre Lorde, Bell Hooks and Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so wonderful about Ibram is that even though he talks about his journey, and here he is meeting me and Yaba and he\u2019s some kind of black male patriarch homophobe, he never gave us that reception,\u201d says Story, an associate professor of women\u2019s, gender and sexuality studies at the University of Louisville. \u201cHe said, \u2018Okay, these women, if I say how I\u2019m feeling or how I\u2019m thinking about freedom, they\u2019re going to challenge me. ... So let me be open enough to actually listen to what they\u2019re saying.\u2019 And I\u2019m grateful for that. ... Ideological vulnerability is so important when it comes to dealing with ideas of anti-racism and intersectionality.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, Kendi was doing postdoctoral work at Rutgers University \u2014 turning his dissertation into his first book, \u201cThe Black Campus Movement\u201d \u2014 when he met Sadiqa, who was doing a fellowship in pediatric emergency medicine in Philadelphia. He had reached out to her on Match.com. \u201cWe both kind of ended up in online dating in the same way,\u201d she recalls. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t have time but still wanted to pursue meeting people. ... I saw he was younger than me and said, \u2018Well, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to date this dude. But I\u2019m a nice person, so I\u2019ll respond at least.\u2019 So I responded and we ended up going back and forth on Match and communicating there for a little while. After a few back-and-forth messages on Match, I thought, \u2018Well, gosh, this guy actually seems really cool, pretty mature.\u2019 So I gave him a chance.\u201d\n\nAfter they had been dating for a few months, Sadiqa and Ibram had dinner at an Asian fusion restaurant in Philadelphia. There was a big statue of the Buddha against a wall, and a drunk white man climbed up and began fondling the statue, to the amusement of his friends. At least he\u2019s not black, Sadiqa recalls saying of the white man. Why? Ibram asked. We don\u2019t need anyone making us look bad, Sadiqa replied.\n\nSo began an extended conversation about \u201cuplift suasion,\u201d another racist concept Kendi realized he needed to shed \u2014 the assumption that black conduct is to blame for white racist ideas, thus legitimizing white racist ideas about black conduct. \u201cI realized early on that if I\u2019m going to be with Ibram, we\u2019re going to have some discussions on some stuff that is deep,\u201d Sadiqa told me.\n\nBy 2013, they were ready to make plans for a spring wedding on a beach in Jamaica, which Essence would photograph for a \u201cBridal Bliss\u201d feature. There was one more detail to take care of, another case of life and work merging: During his painstaking hunt for the origin and effect of every racist idea he could find, Kendi had discovered that perhaps the first racist idea \u2014 grouping all Africans as a single, inferior people \u2014 is contained in the 1453 biography of arguably the first racist, Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal, who was the first European to orchestrate a slave-trade that exclusively targeted Africans. The moment is also significant because, Kendi would argue later, it marked the original case of a racist policy, created out of economic self-interest, being justified by a racist idea: that captive Africans were being civilized and saved by slavery.\n\nThe budding historian and evolving anti-racist \u2014 still known then as Ibram H. Rogers \u2014 became uncomfortable with his middle name: Henry, after his enslaved great-great-great-grandfather. He reasoned that the fate of his ancestor Henry had been set in motion by the original racist, Prince Henry. So as part of the wedding ceremony, with Carol and Larry Rogers officiating, Ibram adopted the middle name Xolani, meaning \u201cpeace\u201d in Zulu. At the same time, he and Sadiqa took the last name Kendi, which means \u201cloved one\u201d in the Meru language of eastern Africa.\n\n\n\nKendi at the Atlantic Festival. (Photograph by Michael A. McCoy)\n\nOn a Tuesday evening in mid-August, Kendi brought his ideas to a packed crowd of 575 people invited by a local bookstore to Congregation Beth Elohim in Brooklyn. It was the first stop on his marathon tour for \u201cHow to Be an Antiracist,\u201d with dates scheduled through March. It also happened to be his 37th birthday, and his parents, wife and 3-year-old daughter, Imani, were in the audience. Activist and writer Shaun King was seated beside Kendi at the front of the sanctuary to lead the conversation. \u201cWho needs this book?\u201d King began. \u201cWho is this book for?\u201d\n\nAnti-racism, Kendi said, \u201cis recognizing how we\u2019ve been trained, nurtured and educated in ways to be racists. How hard it is to grow up in a racist society, where racist ideas are constantly being rained on your head, and never get wet.\u201d That\u2019s why, he concluded, the book is \u201cfor people who think somebody else could use it instead of them. Because I know I needed this book when I was 30, when I was 25 ... and I could even still use this book today.\u201d\n\nHe started his answers to King\u2019s questions low and slow. As he got swept up in his argument, his voice picked up speed and gained about an octave in outrage. At one point, Imani emerged from the audience and climbed into his lap. She listened quietly until Kendi wheeled into a riff about how there are only two explanations for a racial inequity such as black unemployment being significantly higher than white unemployment: \u201cEither there\u2019s something wrong with black workers \u2014 [which is a] racist idea \u2014 or there\u2019s something happening to black workers as they move into the job market\u201d \u2014 i.e., racist policies. \u201cRelax, Daddy!\u201d Imani said.\n\nThe audience on this night was predominantly white, as it was on the other two occasions I watched Kendi discuss his work and sign hundreds of books: at a church in Lower Manhattan and at Sidwell Friends School in Washington. Kendi has a lot to say to the types of white people who flock to book events about racism. \u201cI can talk all day about how endemic racism is within American conservatism,\u201d he said in Brooklyn. \u201cBut when you look at radical thought, when you look at progressive thought, when you look at liberal thought, there are prevailing racist ideas that people are not confronting. Liberals have long made the case there\u2019s something behaviorally or culturally wrong with black people \u2014 progressives and radicals have long made the case there\u2019s something behaviorally wrong with black people \u2014 but that those inferior behaviors come about as a result of their oppression, their poverty, slavery. \u2018Yes, they are inferior, but [it\u2019s] because of what they\u2019re experiencing, the racism they\u2019re experiencing, so that\u2019s why you need to fight racism!\u2019 \u201d\n\nKendi calls this the \u201coppression-inferiority thesis\u201d \u2014 the often well-meaning but always destructive idea that mass oppression must manifest itself somehow in defective group behavior, hence the pitiable group must be championed. In \u201cAntiracist,\u201d Kendi quotes abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison\u2019s preface to Frederick Douglass\u2019s slave narrative of 1845: Slavery degraded black people \u201cin the scale of humanity. ... Nothing has been left undone to cripple their intellects, darken their minds, debase their moral nature, obliterate all traces of their relationship to mankind.\u201d Then there is Barack Obama\u2019s campaign speech on race in 2008: \u201cFor all those who scratched and clawed their way to get a piece of the American Dream, there were many who didn\u2019t make it \u2014 those who were ultimately defeated, in one way or another, by discrimination. That legacy of defeat was passed on to future generations \u2014 those young men and increasingly young women who we see standing on street corners or languishing in our prisons, without hope or prospects for the future.\u201d\n\nI think a lot of times we think about this as the work for other people, specifically white people,\u201d says high school teacher Tamika Golden, \u201cand I recognize that this work is for all people.\n\nOn the contrary, Kendi told any progressives in Brooklyn who might think that way, \u201cyou assume that since the system is dehumanizing, that it is literally making the people subhuman. No. The beauty of humanity is we have the capacity and the ability to strive and thrive in the most horrible, oppressive and dehumanizing conditions. And certainly black people did that during slavery, and they\u2019ve been doing that ever since.\u201d\n\nThe white audience members I spoke with after the events were looking for a way to describe what they were seeing in the America of 2019. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of categories of awfulness going on,\u201d said Miles Seligman, a medical coder in Brooklyn. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing \u2014 from the message and the language and the vocabulary of this kind of book \u2014 that can\u2019t help me understand that better.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the example of a black man going first in a prospective communal racial confessional \u2014 and this black man\u2019s conception of racism as a curable condition rather than a damnation for all time \u2014 seemed to encourage white listeners to look inward. \u201cRacism doesn\u2019t necessarily make you a bad person,\u201d said Jimmy Dabrowski, who took three trains from New Jersey to hear Kendi at the church in Lower Manhattan. \u201cYou have to be willing to accept it and then face the reality that anti-racism is the only way forward.\u201d Dabrowski is a health and phys-ed teacher at an elementary school in Perth Amboy. \u201cI\u2019m not an activist,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I would hope that maybe by initiating a policy change where we have anti-racism in schools \u2014 that\u2019s the kind of activism in my field I want to push for.\u201d\n\nThe black audience members I met were already familiar with Kendi\u2019s work. They came clutching well-thumbed copies of \u201cStamped From the Beginning.\u201d In other words, they did not need to be taught the language. Rather, they were here to heed Kendi\u2019s call for everyone to aspire to more-perfect anti-racism.\n\n\u201cWhat led me to his work was the belief that what I offered to my students had to be more than what I was giving them now,\u201d said Tamika Golden, a high school English teacher in Brooklyn who uses \u201cStamped From the Beginning\u201d in her classes. \u201cI needed to figure out what it meant for me to be an anti-racist and to truly work against the socialization and the feelings and thoughts I had about my own people as a group. ... I think a lot of times we think about this as the work for other people, specifically white people, and I recognize that this work is for all people.\u201d\n\nAnwar Abdul-Rahman, principal at a charter middle school in Brooklyn where the majority of students are black or Latino, told me Kendi\u2019s work offered \u201ca framework for looking at racist ideas in America. You have your segregationists, you have assimilationists, and then you have your racist ideas and then counteracting that with anti-racism and what does that look like \u2014 I thought that was just a real profound idea that even as a black man was something that I could use in my life.\u201d He, too, finds ways to work Kendi into the curriculum.\n\nTo his publics of all races, Kendi offers the same redemptive promise. In Brooklyn, King had asked him to read a couple of pages aloud. Kendi\u2019s voice, now sonorous and incantatory, transformed the passages into a prose poem, ending with this paragraph: \u201cBut there is a way to get free. To be antiracist is to emancipate oneself from the dueling consciousness. To be antiracist is to conquer the assimilationist consciousness and the segregationist consciousness. The White body no longer presents itself as the American body; the Black body no longer strives to be the American body, knowing there is no such thing as the American body, only American bodies, racialized by power.\u201d\n\n\n\n(Photograph by Michael A. McCoy)\n\nKendi received his cancer diagnosis just as he was focusing his writing on the role of denial in the persistence of racism \u2014 all those folks who say they are \u201cnot racist.\u201d At the time, he was a seemingly healthy, relatively young man with no apparent risk factors. Denial was an option for him, too.\n\n\u201cIf I would have denied that I had cancer, then the cancer would have just continued to spread and eventually would have killed me,\u201d he told me. \u201cI had also been thinking about, even before the diagnosis, about how important it is for Americans to stop denying the existence of racism itself. ... The fact that in order for America to survive racism, they had to stop denying racism. Then, in that moment \u2014 in that same week \u2014 I was diagnosed with metastatic cancer.\u201d\n\nWhen he felt better, he began to write new sentences \u2014 hopeful sentences \u2014 that found their way into the last chapter of the new book: \u201cWe can survive metastatic racism. Forgive me. I cannot separate the two, and no longer try. ... What if we treated racism in the way we treat cancer? ... Saturate the body politic with the chemotherapy or immunotherapy of antiracist policies that shrink the tumors of racial inequities, that kill undetectable cancer cells.\u201d\n\nSadiqa told me she and Ibram had a deal during his treatment regimen. He could continue to write, lecture, run the Antiracist Center, as long as he would listen to her on the occasions she detected he was pushing himself too hard. \u201cPeople heal differently, and for him, he needed to have some semblance of his life, of his work, in order to mentally have the fight that I knew he would need for healing,\u201d she said. \u201cPushing and making that will-to-live larger than giving up and succumbing to something that, if you just look at the numbers, was likely to take his life.\u201d At least once, when he had a bad fever during chemo, she ordered him to cancel a speaking trip. \u201cHe was upset, but he listened,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter six months of chemotherapy, at the end of summer 2018, surgeons removed tissue in which pathologists found no cancer cells. This past summer, his body was scanned and all looked clear. \u201cI can\u2019t necessarily call myself a survivor as much as I\u2019m surviving it,\u201d Kendi told me. \u201cBut I think I\u2019m headed in a good direction.\u201d\n\nAnd the rest of us? What direction are we headed in? The popularity of his books and the size of his lecture crowds are signs that more and more people are willing to look inside themselves to consider their own racism. At the talk in Brooklyn, King asked Kendi where he finds hope. Kendi went through the history of anti-racist progress, then added, \u201cIn order to bring about change, you literally have to believe in the possibility of change\u201d \u2014 just as you have to believe in the possibility of a cure. \u201cHere I am,\u201d he told the audience, \u201ccancer-free.\u201d\n\nBut for America, it\u2019s touch and go. Racist ideas continue to kill \u2014 that\u2019s no metaphor \u2014 as the El Paso shooter most recently demonstrated. At times, Kendi sounds like an oncologist who has seen the worst. \u201cIt\u2019s the same case with racism,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou have people who do not want to take America, or even themselves, through the pain of healing because they\u2019re convinced that it\u2019s not going to work. Which makes sense if they\u2019re convinced it\u2019s not going to work. But once we convince ourselves that America can never heal itself from racism, then racism will persist and, I suspect, eventually destroy this country.\u201d\n\nDavid Montgomery is a staff writer for the magazine.", "description": "\u201cThe heartbeat of antiracism is confession.\u201d", "authors": ["David Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jFPPH4i6Pq07zSBQSAMx__eX0AA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J23NMWXOXAI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
