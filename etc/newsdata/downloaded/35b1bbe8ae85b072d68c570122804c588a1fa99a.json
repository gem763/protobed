Friends and family had criticized the portrayal as disrespectful, while Tarantino defended his characterization of the martial arts star, saying he was \u201ckind of an arrogant guy.\u201d\n\nChina film regulators did not comment on the delayed release.\n\nProduction of Once Upon A Time In Hollywood was funded by Sony as well as the Chinese film distributor Bona Film Group, which is a subsidiary of China Poly Group, a state-owned company specializing in the defense manufacturing industry. Bona and Tarantino were rushing to recut the film to pass the censorship process.\n\nTarantino\u2019s new film would have marked his first widespread screening in China. In 2012 his earlier film Django Unchained was pulled from theaters minutes into screenings on opening night, purportedly after a Communist Party official objected to violence portrayed on screen.\n\nOnce Upon A Time In Hollywood has grossed roughly $366 million in theaters worldwide. Its distribution in the Chinese market was expected to highly enhance that revenue.\n\nFilms released in China must be reviewed and, if necessary, recut by regulators before screening to audiences. Some of China\u2019s most prominent directors have been affected by the censorship rules.\n\nChina also censors content on social media based in the country, a policy that has prevented Facebook and its subsidiaries, Instagram and Whatsapp, from establishing a foothold in the Chinese market.\n\nThe Beijing-based app Tik Tok, which has roughly 100 million users worldwide, is reported to actively censor content according to the direction of the Chinese state.", "description": "Chinese film regulators put the October 25 release of Quentin Tarantino's 'Once Upon A Time In Hollywood' on hold after Bruce Lee's daughter objected.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Mairead Mcardle", "Jim Geraghty", "Kevin D.
