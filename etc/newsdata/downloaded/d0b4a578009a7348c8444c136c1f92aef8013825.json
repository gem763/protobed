Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg sought to rally employees amid a litany of challenges the social media company has faced over the past year and a half, speaking candidly in two hours of leaked audio recordings published by the Verge.\n\nWhile Zuckerberg often got laughs and tried to create a friendly banter with employees, the mood inside the company remains anxious, the Verge reported.\n\nAddressing questions raised at two open meetings with employees in July, Zuckerberg took on subjects from U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s plans to break up the company if elected president, to the rocky rollout of Libra and a new product to compete with TikTok.\n\nIf Warren were to be elected, \u201cthen I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cAnd does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government\u2026. But look, at the end of the day, if someone\u2019s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and fight.\u201d\n\nWarren responded to the story in her own tweet. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to hold Big Tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon accountable,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s time to #BreakUpBigTech.\u201d\n\nI'm not afraid to hold Big Tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon accountable. It's time to #BreakUpBigTech: https://t.co/o9X9v4noOm \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 1, 2019\n\nThe meetings took place after Facebook was fined US$5 billion by the Federal Trade Commission, an amount largely seen as a slap on the wrist for the company, as was the settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for US$100 million. But the scandals over data privacy laid bare by the Cambridge Analytica affair, the near-constant critiques and demand for testimony at lengthy hearings in the U.S. and Europe, and antitrust investigations on multiple fronts seem to have taken a toll. Employees had questions for Zuckerberg himself, and worried about Facebook\u2019s increasingly dim reputation among their peers, according to the Verge.\n\nZuckerberg explained his decision on why he wouldn\u2019t travel the world to testify in front of some foreign governments. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make sense for me to go to hearings in every single country that wants to have me show up,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked about competition with TikTok, a popular video and social media app owned by China\u2019s ByteDance Inc., Zuckerberg said Facebook has an answer. \u201cWe have a product called Lasso that\u2019s a standalone app that we\u2019re working on, trying to get product-market fit in countries like Mexico,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to first see if we can get it to work in countries where TikTok isn\u2019t already big before we go and compete with TikTok in countries where they are big.\u201d\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "CEO sought to rally employees, speaking candidly in two hours of leaked audio recordings published by the Verge", "authors": ["Molly Schuetz", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/zuckerberg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
