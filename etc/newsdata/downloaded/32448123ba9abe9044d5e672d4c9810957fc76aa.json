The extent of any change in reserves and resources cannot be precisely determined until all of the relevant studies and modelling are completed, including studies to optimize the economics of the mine and further work to incorporate results of the Company\u2019s exploration drilling in 2019. However, based upon the work performed in connection with the impairment test, the Company\u2019s expectation is that Mount Milligan\u2019s mineral reserves and resources will be materially reduced.\n\nCompleted Strategic Agreement with the Kyrgyz Republic Government; an additional expense of $10 million was recorded in the period and cash payments of $62.6 million, were made.\n\nGordon D. Reid, Vice President and Chief Operating Officer has announced his retirement effective January 1, 2020. Dan Desjardins, currently the President of our Kumtor Mine, will succeed Gordon.\n\nCommentary\n\nScott Perry, President and Chief Executive Officer of Centerra stated, \u201cDuring the quarter we achieved a number of significant Lost Time Injury Free milestones including one million work hours at our \u00d6ks\u00fct Project and Mount Milligan, one full year at Kumtor and most recently six full years without incurring a lost time injury to our employees or contractors at the Endako Mine. These achievements validate that Zero Harm is within our reach at Centerra and demonstrates our workforce\u2019s commitment to Centerra\u2019s Work Safe \u2013 Home Safe program as we continue to build a team-based culture of excellence that responsibly delivers sustainable value and growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe operations produced a total of 205,660 ounces of gold and 21.2 million pounds of copper in the quarter. Kumtor had another strong quarter as we got into higher-grade ore earlier than expected producing 150,305 ounces of gold. Mount Milligan had a strong quarter, the mill throughput averaged 55,727 tonnes per calendar day, producing 55,355 ounces of gold and 21.2 million pounds of copper.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompany-wide our all-in sustaining costs (before taxes)NG were $666 per ounce sold for the quarter reflecting Mount Milligan achieving all-in sustaining costs (before taxes)NG of $557 per ounce and Kumtor realizing all-in sustaining costs (before taxes)NG of $626 per ounce.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs part of our recent annual budgeting process, we identified that long term recoveries are expected to decrease and recent cost escalation will continue at current levels in the short to medium term at the Mount Milligan mine. This triggered the need to complete an impairment test on Mount Milligan\u2019s long-lived assets. The test identified an impairment of $230.5 million which we reflected in the quarter. The company has begun a comprehensive technical review of Mount Milligan with the objective of publishing an updated NI 43-101 technical report in the coming months. The extent of any change in reserves and resources cannot be precisely determined until all of the relevant studies and modelling are completed, including studies to optimize the economics of the mine and further work to incorporate results of the Company\u2019s exploration drilling through 2019. However, based upon the work performed in connection with the impairment test, the Company\u2019s expectation is that Mount Milligan\u2019s mineral reserves and resources will be materially reduced.\u201d\n\n\u201cConstruction activity continued at the \u00d6ks\u00fct Project in Turkey and the project is now 79% complete with the crushing circuit and Absorption Desorption Regeneration (\u201cADR\u201d) plant commissioned, mining commenced in both the Keltepe and G\u00fcneytepe pits and the completion of the Heap Leach Pad readying it for the stacking of ore. The project remains on schedule with first gold pour expected in January of 2020.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinancially, the business delivered $32 million of cash from operations in the quarter. Excluding the $63 million payment for the completion of the Strategic Agreement, the adjusted cash flow from operationsNG was $95 million. At the operating level, Kumtor and Mount Milligan generated $74 million and $37 million, respectively, of cash from operations before working capital changesNG in the quarter. During the third quarter, Kumtor generated $42 million of free cash flowNG before reflecting the completion payment and Mount Milligan generated $31 million of free cash flowNG.\u201d\n\nExploration Update\n\nExploration activities in the third quarter of 2019 included drilling, surface sampling, geological mapping and geophysical surveying at the Company\u2019s various projects (including earn-in properties) targeting gold and copper mineralization in Turkey, Canada, Mexico, Sweden, Finland and Burkina Faso. Exploration expenditures totaled $7.6 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $7.2 million in the same quarter of 2018 ($18.9 million compared to $14.3 million, year-to-date). The Company\u2019s 2019 exploration program is primarily focused on brownfield exploration at Kumtor, Mount Milligan, \u00d6ks\u00fct and Kemess.\n\nKumtor Mine\n\nAt Kumtor, planned exploration work is aimed at defining additional resources on the flanks of the Central Pit, focusing on the Hockey Stick Zone and the SB Zone deep extension to add to the open pit mine life.

Overview of Consolidated Results\n\nThird quarter 2019 compared to Third Quarter 2018\n\nThe Company recorded a net loss of $165.1 million in the third quarter of 2019, compared to income of $6.0 million in the comparative prior year period. Losses in the third quarter of 2019 reflect a $230.5 million impairment charge on the Mount Milligan mine primarily due to an adjustment to a higher cost profile and an anticipated reduction in gold recoveries; and an additional $10 million charge to reflect the final settlement of the Strategic Agreement with the Kyrgyz Government. Excluding these charges, adjusted earningsNG for the third quarter of 2019 were $75.4 million, compared to adjusted earningsNG of $14.5 million in the comparative period. The higher adjusted earningsNG are due to an increase in ounces sold at Kumtor and at Mount Milligan, as well as higher realized gold prices. The significant increase in production at Kumtor was as a result of processing higher grade ore and achieving higher recoveries. At Mount Milligan mill throughput averaged 55,727 tonnes per calendar day in the third quarter of 2019 due to increased mill availability.\n\nCash provided by operations was $31.9 million in the third quarter of 2019, compared to $37.6 million in the same prior year period. This reduction was a result of the $62.6 million of payments made by Kumtor Gold Company upon closing the Kumtor Strategic Agreement. Excluding this payment, adjusted cash provided by operationsNG in the third quarter of 2019 was $94.5 million compared to $37.6 million for the comparative period in 2018. The increase mainly related to higher adjusted earningsNG. Increased adjusted earningsNG also explains the higher adjusted free cash flow (unlevered)NG of $10.1 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to adjusted free cash flow deficit (unlevered)NG of $(24.1) million in the same prior year period.\n\nCash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2019 was $80.5 million, as compared to $151.7 million at December 31, 2018. As at September 30, 2019, the $500 million corporate credit facility (\u201cCenterra Revolving Term Corporate Facility\u201d or \u201cCorporate Facility\u201d) remains undrawn and available in full.\n\nThe available balance on the Company\u2019s $150 million five-year credit project financing facility for the \u00d6ks\u00fct Project (\u201cOMAS Facility\u201d) at September 30, 2019 was $73.5 million. The undrawn amount is subject to the completion of current negotiations with the OMAS Facility lenders, contemplating a revised repayment schedule that gives consideration to the revised production profile, with first gold pour estimated for January 2020.\n\nSafety and Environment\n\nDuring the quarter Centerra achieved a number of significant Lost Time Injury Free (\u201cLTI\u201d) milestones including one million LTI free work hours at Mount Milligan, one year of LTI free operation at Kumtor and one million LTI free work hours at the \u00d6ks\u00fct Project.\n\nThere were no reportable releases to the environment in the third quarter of 2019.\n\nFirst Nine Months 2019 compared to First Nine Months 2018\n\nThe Company recorded a net loss of $81.3 million in the first nine months of 2019, compared to net earnings of $58.6 million in the same period of 2018. The first nine months of 2019 reflect the $230.5 impairment charge on the Mount Milligan Mine and an additional $10 million charge on final settlement of the Strategic Agreement with the Kyrgyz Government. Excluding these costs, adjusted earningsNG were $159.2 million in the first nine months of 2019 compared to $28.9 million in the comparative period after adjusting for a $28.0 million gain on sale of the Company\u2019s royalty portfolio, a $9.4 million gain on the sale of the Altan Tsagaan Ovoo property in Mongolia and an $8.5 million write-down of the Mongolian business unit prior to its sale. The increase in adjusted earningsNG in the current nine-month period was due to increased sales at both Kumtor and Mount Milligan. At Kumtor, the significant increase in ounces produced and sold was as a result of processing higher grade ore and achieving higher recoveries. At Mount Milligan the increased sales levels reflect more concentrate shipments, higher mill throughput, coupled with higher copper grades and recoveries and higher gold recoveries.\n\nCash provided by operations was $241.6 million in the first nine months of 2019, which included the Kyrgyz Republic settlement payment of $62.6 million. Excluding this payment, adjusted cash provided by operationsNG for the 2019 year-to-date was $304.2 million compared to $70.3 million in the comparative prior year period. The increase resulted mainly from higher sales volumes at both Kumtor and Mount Milligan and higher realized gold prices, offset by lower gold grades at Mount Milligan. Higher adjusted free cash flow (unlevered)NG of $98.2 million in the first nine months of 2019 compared to adjusted free cash flow deficit (unlevered)NG of $(129.5) million in the same prior year period was due to higher adjusted earningsNG.\n\n4. 2019 Outlook\n\nSee \u201cMaterial Assumption and Risks\u201d for material assumptions or factors used to forecast production and costs for 2019.\n\n2019 Production and Sales Guidance\n\nThe Company is increasing its 2019 consolidated gold production guidance to 730,000-765,000 ounces which reflects an increase in gold production guidance for Kumtor to 575,000-590,000. This compares to previously issued consolidated gold production guidance of 705,000-750,000 ounces and Kumtor of 550,000-575,000 ounces. These production guidance revisions reflect better than expected performance in the first nine months of 2019. Kumtor\u2019s production in the fourth quarter will be slightly lower than previous quarters due to a newly planned mill maintenance shutdown in the fourth quarter that was previously scheduled to occur in 2020.\n\nThere is no change from previous guidance for gold and copper production from Mount Milligan (streamed and unstreamed).\n\nCenterra\u2019s 2019 production is currently forecast as follows:\n\nUnits Kumtor Mount Milligan(1) Centerra Gold Unstreamed Gold Payable Production (Koz) 575 \u2013 590 101 \u2013 114 676 \u2013 704 Streamed Gold Payable Production(1) (Koz) \u2013 54 \u2013 61 54 \u2013 61 Total Gold Payable Production(2) (Koz) 575 \u2013 590 155 \u2013 175 730 \u2013 765 Copper Unstreamed Copper Payable Production (Mlb) \u2013 53 \u2013 61 53 \u2013 61 Streamed Copper Payable Production(1) (Mlb) \u2013 12 \u2013 14 12 \u2013 14 Total Copper Payable Production(3) (Mlb) \u2013 65 \u2013 75 65 \u2013 75\n\nMount Milligan Streaming Arrangement entitles Royal Gold to 35% and 18.75% of gold and copper sales, respectively, from the Mount Milligan mine. Under the Mount Milligan Streaming Arrangement, Royal Gold will pay $435 per ounce of gold delivered and 15% of the spot price per metric tonne of copper delivered. Gold production assumes 82.9% recovery at Kumtor and 66.9% recovery at Mount Milligan. Copper production assumes 81.6% recovery for copper at Mount Milligan.\n\nThe Company is increasing its 2019 consolidated gold sales guidance to 745,000-785,000 ounces which reflects an increase in its gold sales guidance for Kumtor to 590,000-610,000 ounces, due to the better than expected performance in the first nine months of 2019. This compares to the previously issued consolidated gold sales guidance of 705,000-750,000 ounces and Kumtor of 550,000-575,000 ounces.\n\n2019 All-in Sustaining Unit CostsNG\n\nCenterra\u2019s 2019 all-in sustaining costs per ounce sold NG, calculated on a by-product basis, are forecasted to remain unchanged from previous guidance and are as follows:\n\nUnits Kumtor Mount Milligan(2) Centerra(2) Ounces sold forecast (Koz) 590 \u2013 610 155 \u2013 175 745 \u2013 785 All-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis(1), (2) ($/oz) $635 - $685 $727 - $821 $713 \u2013 $743 Revenue-based tax(3) and taxes(3) ($/oz) 186 \u2013 195 21 - 24 148 \u2013 157 All-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis, including taxes (1), (2), (3) ($/oz) $821 \u2013 $880 $748 \u2013 $845 $861 \u2013 $900 Gold - All-in sustaining costs on a co-product basis ($/ounce) (1),(2) ($/oz) $635 - $685 $842 - $950 $722 - $768 Copper - All-in sustaining costs on a co-product basis ($/pound) (1),(2) ($/lb) \u2013 $1.84 - $2.12 $1.84 \u2013 $2.12\n\n1) All-in sustaining costs per ounce sold, all-in sustaining costs per ounce sold on a by-product basis, all-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis including taxes per ounce sold and all-in sustaining costs on a co-product basis (gold and copper) on a per unit basis are non-GAAP measures and are discussed under \u201cNon-GAAP Measures\u201d.\n\n2) Mount Milligan payable production and ounces sold are on a 100% basis (the Mount Milligan Streaming Arrangement entitles Royal Gold to 35% and 18.75% of gold and copper sales, respectively). Unit costs and consolidated unit costs include a credit for forecasted copper sales treated as by-product for all-in sustaining costs and all-in sustaining costs plus taxes. The copper sales are based on a copper price assumption of $2.60 per pound sold for Centerra\u2019s 81.25% share of copper production and the remaining 18.75% of copper revenue at $0.39 per pound (15% of spot price, assuming spot at $2.60 per pound), representing the Mount Milligan Streaming Arrangement. Payable production for copper and gold reflects estimated metallurgical losses resulting from handling of the concentrate and payable metal deductions, subject to metal content, levied by smelters.\n\n3) Includes revenue-based tax at Kumtor and the British Columbia mineral tax at Mount Milligan based on a forecast gold price assumption of $1,375 per ounce sold.\n\n4) Results in chart may not add due to rounding.\n\n2019 Capital Spending\n\nCenterra\u2019s 2019 guidance for capital spending, excluding capitalized stripping has been decreased to $260 million from $275 million as a result of a $15 million deferral in the expected spending at the \u00d6ks\u00fct Project in 2019 to 2020. Total project costs at the \u00d6ks\u00fct Project remains unchanged at $200 million, to be completed in the first half of 2020. The change in growth capital at \u00d6ks\u00fct for 2019 to $85 million from the previous guidance of $100 million is due to the deferral of certain non-essential construction activities to after commissioning.\n\nProjected capital expenditures (excluding capitalized stripping) include:\n\nProjects ($ millions) 2019 Sustaining Capital 2019 Growth Capital Kumtor Mine 45 20 Mount Milligan Mine 45 - \u00d6ks\u00fct Project - 85 Kemess Underground Project - 35 Greenstone Gold Property - 20 Other(1) 10 - Consolidated Total $100 $160\n\n1) Thompson Creek Mine, Endako Mine (75% ownership), Langeloth facility and Corporate\n\nTotal capitalized stripping at Kumtor is expected to decrease to $125 million from previous guidance of $140 million. The cash component and non-cash components are forecasted to be $100 million and $25 million, respectively, from previous guidance of $110 million and $30 million, respectively. The decrease is primarily due to the revised stripping activity performed in cut-backs 19 and 20.\n\n2019 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization\n\nConsolidated depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense included in costs of sales expense for 2019 is forecasted to remain unchanged from the previous guidance of $240 - $260 million.\n\n2019 Other Costs\n\nForecasted costs in 2019 for care and maintenance at the Molybdenum business unit, financing, exploration and income taxes remain unchanged from the previously issued guidance of $13-$15 million, $16-18 million, $30 million and $3.2 - $4.2 million, respectively.\n\nSensitivities\n\nCenterra\u2019s revenues, earnings and cash flows for the remaining three months of 2019 are sensitive to changes in certain key inputs or currencies. The Company has estimated the impact of any such changes on revenues, net earnings and cash from operations.\n\nChange Impact on\n\n($ millions) Impact on\n\n($ per ounce sold) Costs(3) Revenues Cash flows Net Earnings (after tax) AISC(2)(3) on by-product basis Gold price $50/oz 0.8 \u2013 1.3 6.9 \u2013 8.1 6 \u2013 7.1 6 \u2013 7.1 0 \u2013 1 Copper price 10 % 0.1 \u2013 0.2 2.5 \u2013 4.6 2.4 \u2013 4.4 2.4 \u2013 4.4 4 \u2013 5 Diesel fuel 10 % 1 \u2013 2 - 1 \u2013 2 1 \u2013 2 1 \u2013 3 Kyrgyz som(1) 1 som 0.3 \u2013 0.8 - 0.3 \u2013 0.8 0.3 \u2013 0.8 2\u2013 3 Turkish Lira(1) 1 lira 0.3 \u2013 0.5 - 0.3 \u2013 0.5 - - Canadian dollar(1) 10 cents 3 \u2013 5 - 3 \u2013 5 2 \u2013 4 1\u2013 3\n\n(1) Appreciation of currency against the U.S. dollar will result in higher costs and lower cash flow and earnings, depreciation of currency against the U.S. dollar results in decreased costs and increased cash flow and earnings.\n\n(2) Non-GAAP measure. See discussion under \u201cNon-GAAP Measures\u201d,\n\n(3) Includes capital costs and AISC is calculated over the full year ounces sold forecast\n\nProduction, cost and capital forecasts for 2019 are forward-looking information and are based on key assumptions and subject to material risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially and which are discussed herein under the headings \u201cMaterial Assumptions & Risks\u201d and \u201cCaution Regarding Forward-Looking Information\u201d in this document and under the heading \u201cRisks That Can Affect Our Business\u201d in the Company\u2019s 2018 Annual Information Form.\n\nMaterial Assumptions and Risks\n\nMaterial assumptions or factors used to forecast production and costs for the remaining three months of 2019 include the following:\n\na gold price of $1,375 per ounce, up from $1,300 per ounce,\n\na copper price of $2.60 per pound, down from $2.70 per pound,\n\na molybdenum price of $12 per pound, unchanged,\n\nexchange rates (unchanged): $1USD:$1.30 Canadian dollar, $1USD:69.0 Kyrgyz som, $1USD:5.50 Turkish lira, $1USD:0.88 Euro,\n\ndiesel fuel price assumption: $0.54/litre at Kumtor, $0.91/litre (CAD$1.30/litre) at Mount Milligan.\n\n\n\nThe assumed diesel price of $0.54/litre at Kumtor assumes that no Russian export duty will be paid on the fuel exports from Russia to the Kyrgyz Republic. Diesel fuel for Kumtor is sourced from separate Russian suppliers. The diesel fuel price assumes a price of oil of approximately $86 per barrel. Crude oil is a component of diesel fuel purchased by the Company, such that changes in the price of Brent crude oil generally impacts diesel fuel prices. The Company established a hedging strategy to manage changes in diesel fuel prices on the cost of operations at the Kumtor mine.\n\nOther material assumptions used in forecasting production, costs and capital forecasts for the remaining three months of 2019 are unchanged from the prior guidance disclosure of July 30, 2019.\n\nQualified Person & QA/QC \u2013 Production Information\n\nThe production information and other scientific and technical information presented in this document, including the production estimates were prepared in accordance with the standards of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum and NI 43-101 and (except as otherwise noted) were prepared, reviewed, verified and compiled by Centerra\u2019s geological and mining staff under the supervision of Gordon Reid, Professional Engineer and Centerra\u2019s Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, who is the qualified person for the purpose of NI 43-101. Sample preparation, analytical techniques, laboratories used and quality assurance-quality control protocols used during the exploration drilling programs are done consistent with industry standards and independent certified assay labs are used.\n\n5. Financial Performance\n\nThird Quarter 2019 compared to Third Quarter 2018\n\nRevenue increased to $388.3 million in the third quarter of 2019 from $259.1 million in the comparative period, as a result of 30% more gold ounces sold, 22% higher average realized gold price, 61% more copper pounds sold and 7% higher molybdenum sales as compared to 2018, partially offset by 5% lower average realized copper prices.\n\nGold production for the third quarter of 2019 was 205,660 ounces compared to 181,243 ounces for the same prior year period. Gold production at Kumtor was 150,305 ounces in the third quarter of 2019, 23% more than the same prior year period. The increase in ounces produced at Kumtor was a result of milling ore with higher grades (3.8 g/t compared to 3.0 g/t) partly due to accessing higher grade material earlier than the prior period, positive grade reconciliations and higher recoveries (84.8% compared to 79.0%). During the third quarter 2019, Mount Milligan produced 55,355 ounces of gold, a 6% decrease from the same prior year period as higher mill availability, throughput and copper production were offset by lower gold grades in 2019. Copper production at Mount Milligan during the third quarter of 2019 was 21.2 million pounds, 8.5 million pounds higher than the comparative prior year period, reflecting higher mill availability, higher grades and higher recoveries.\n\nCost of sales increased in the third quarter of 2019 to $236.6 million compared to $189.0 million in the same period of 2018, mainly due to higher sales volumes at both operating mines and increased depreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization associated with production was $66.8 million in the third quarter of 2019 as compared to $48.4 million in the same prior year period, driven primarily by the increase in sales volume and additional depreciation of capitalized stripping costs at Kumtor.\n\nCenterra\u2019s all-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis per ounce of gold soldNG, which excludes revenue-based tax and income tax, decreased to $666 per ounce in the third quarter of 2019 from $698 per ounce in the comparative prior year period due primarily to more ounces sold and higher copper credits, partially offset by higher capitalized stripping costs at Kumtor.\n\nAn impairment charge of $230.5 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2019 on the Mount Milligan Mine reflecting the impact of a higher cost profile which will continue in the short to medium term and an anticipated reduction in gold recoveries.\n\nExploration expenditures in the third quarter of 2019 were $7.6 million compared to $7.2 million in the comparative prior year period. The increase was due to an additional $1.4 million spent on drilling at Kemess, partially offset by slightly reduced spending at Kumtor and Mount Milligan.\n\nFinancing costs in the third quarter of 2019 were $3.4 million compared to $4.9 million in the comparative prior year period, reflecting the Company\u2019s repayment of the principal outstanding on its Corporate Facility.\n\nCorporate administration costs were $12.7 million in the third quarter of 2019, an increase of $8.2 million compared to the same prior year period, mainly due to an increase of $8.0 million in share-based compensation reflecting an increase in the Company\u2019s share price.\n\nFirst Nine Months 2019 compared to First Nine Months 2018\n\nRevenue increased to $1,062.8 million in the first nine months of 2019 from $737.8 million in the comparative prior year period, as a result of 39% more gold ounces sold, 8% higher average realized gold price, 73% more copper pounds sold and 9% higher molybdenum sales as compared to 2018.\n\nGold production for the first nine months of 2019 was 588,802 ounces compared to 441,189 ounces for the same prior year period. Gold production at Kumtor was 451,679 ounces in the first nine months of 2019, 47% more than the 306,467 ounces produced in the comparative period. The increase in ounces produced at Kumtor was a result of milling more ore from higher grade stockpiles (3.7g/t compared to 2.6g/t) and higher recoveries (83.0% compared to 74.3%). During the first nine months of 2019, Mount Milligan produced 137,123 ounces of gold and 53.1 million pounds of copper, 2% and 50% more than in the same period of 2018, reflecting higher mill availability and throughput, higher copper grades and higher gold recoveries, partially offset by lower gold grade.\n\nCost of sales increased in the first nine months of 2019 to $698.4 million compared to $529.2 million in the same prior year period. Cost of sales at Mount Milligan were higher due primarily to higher sales volumes and higher mining and milling costs, including higher water sourcing costs. Higher costs and volumes resulted in a 16% increase in cost of sales in the molybdenum business. Depreciation, depletion and amortization associated with production was $180.2 million in the first nine months of 2019 as compared to $133.2 million in the same period of 2018. The increase was due primarily to greater depreciation of capitalized stripping costs at Kumtor.\n\nAll-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis per ounce of gold soldNG, which excludes revenue-based tax and income tax, decreased to $683 per ounce in the first nine months of 2019 from $861 per ounce in the comparative period mainly as a result of more ounces sold, higher copper credits and lower capitalized stripping costs at Kumtor, partially offset by higher administration costs.\n\nAn impairment charge of $230.5 million was recorded in the first nine months of 2019 on the Mount Milligan Mine reflecting the impact of a higher cost profile will to continue in the short to medium term and an anticipated reduction in gold recoveries.\n\nCare and maintenance costs in the first nine months of 2019 totaled $20.1 million compared to $23.0 million in the comparative prior year period, due primarily to the disposal of the Mongolian business unit in 2018.\n\nExploration expenditures in the first nine months of 2019 were $18.9 million, a 32% increase compared to the $14.3 million in the same period of 2018, reflecting the increased exploration spending at Kumtor, Mount Milligan and Kemess in 2019.\n\nFinancing costs in the first nine months of 2019 were $11.0 million compared to $25.8 million in the comparative prior year period, reflecting the Company\u2019s repayment of its Corporate Facility, which resulted in lower interest expense, and lower financing costs and fees in 2019.\n\nCorporate administration costs increased to $36.1 million in the first nine months of 2019 compared $27.9 million in the same prior year period, mainly due to an increase in share-based compensation of $15.1 million, driven by an increase in the Company\u2019s share price, partially offset by lower professional fees and administration costs associated with the Company\u2019s 2018 acquisitions.\n\n6.

See discussion under \u201cNon-GAAP Measures\u201d\n\nThird Quarter 2019 compared to Third Quarter 2018\n\nFinancial\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2019, Kumtor recognized higher revenue and earnings from operations of 64% and 147%, respectively, compared to the prior period. The increase was mainly associated with more ounces sold, higher realized gold price and lower cost of sales per ounce during the period. Cash provided by operations was $31.1 million lower in 2019 when compared to 2018 due to the $62.6 million settlement payment made to the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\nProduction\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, Kumtor continued mining cut-back 19 West and cut-back 20.\n\nTotal waste and ore mined in the third quarter of 2019 was 38.7 million tonnes compared to 41.6 million tonnes in the comparative prior year period, representing a decrease of 7%, mainly due to weather delays affecting trucks and shovels availability in the current period. In the third quarter of 2019, 4.7 million tonnes of ore mined were mined, a 72% increase from the prior year due to accessing high grade ore earlier in 2019 compared to 2018.\n\nKumtor produced 150,305 ounces of gold in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 122,445 ounces of gold in the same prior year period. The increase in the current quarter was primarily due to processing ore with higher grades from cut-backs 18 and 19 and higher recoveries, compared to processing lower grade ore from cut-back 17 and Sarytor in the third quarter of 2018. During the third quarter of 2019, Kumtor\u2019s average mill head grade was 3.8 g/t with a recovery of 84.8% compared to 3.0 g/t and a recovery of 79.0% in 2018.\n\nMining costs including capitalized stripping\n\nMining costs, including capitalized stripping, were $51.1 million in the third quarter of 2019, a $2 million decrease from the comparative prior year period. Lower costs in the third quarter of 2019 includes lower diesel costs ($3.7 million) due to lower consumption rates from lower tonnes mined and decreased haulage distance. This was offset by higher costs associated with rebuilds when compared to the same prior year period ($1.7 million).\n\nMilling costs\n\nMilling costs were $18.4 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $17.0 million in the prior year period, due primarily to the increased costs of a scheduled maintenance shutdown of the SAG, Ball and Regrind mills in the third quarter of 2019.\n\nSite Support Costs\n\nSite support costs in the third quarter of 2019 were $11.5 million compared to $12.1 million in 2018, due primarily to slightly lower contractor costs and lower cost of camp supplies.\n\nCost of sales\n\nCost of sales, which include non-cash DD&A associated with the ounces sold, was $111.8 million for the third quarter of 2019, an increase of 29% compared to the third quarter of 2018. The increase was primarily due to more ounces sold and increased depreciation of capitalized stripping.\n\nAll-in Sustaining Costs\n\nAll-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis per ounce soldNG, which excludes revenue-based tax, was $626 per ounce in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $662 per ounce in the prior year period. The decrease was due primarily to more ounces sold.\n\nIncluding revenue-based taxes, all-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis per ounce soldNG was $831 per ounce in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $831 per ounce in the prior year period. The lower all-in sustaining costsNG was offset by higher revenue-based taxes as a result of higher sales revenue achieved in the third quarter of 2019.\n\nFirst Nine Months of 2019 compared to First Nine Months of 2018\n\nFinancial\n\nKumtor recognized 52% higher revenues and 108% higher earnings during the first nine months of 2019 when compared to the same prior year period as a result of more ounces sold and lower cost of sales per ounce during the period. Cash provided by operations was $85.7 million higher in 2019 when compared to 2018 due to higher realized gold prices and higher ounces sold.\n\nProduction\n\nDuring the first nine months of 2019, Kumtor focused on developing cut-backs 19 (East and West) and cut-back 20.\n\nTotal waste and ore mined in the first nine months of 2019 was 127.9 million tonnes compared to 132.4 million tonnes in the comparative prior year period, due primarily to weather delays affecting the truck and shovel availability in the current period.\n\nKumtor produced 451,679 ounces of gold in the first nine months of 2019 compared to 306,467 ounces of gold in the first nine months of 2018. The increase was due primarily to processing ore with higher grade and recovery from cut-back 18 and cut-back 19. During the first nine months of 2019, Kumtor\u2019s mill head grade was 3.7 g/t with a recovery of 83.0% in part due to processing higher grade ore and positive grade reconciliations, compared with 2.6 g/t grade and a recovery of 74.3% for the same period in 2018.\n\nMining Costs, including capitalized stripping\n\nMining costs, including capitalized stripping, were $154.8 million in the first nine months of 2019 compared to $157.2 million in the comparative period of 2018. Mining costs decreased slightly due to fewer tonnes mined resulting in a decrease of diesel costs ($5.1 million) and lower blasting supplies ($1.1 million). Diesel costs were further impacted by decreased haulage distances, partially offset by higher assay costs mainly due to an increased number of samples tested and higher costs associated with mechanical rebuilds.\n\nMilling Costs\n\nMilling costs were $53.8 million in the first nine months of 2019 compared to $49.0 million in the comparative prior period, increased due to higher carbon fine processing costs ($1.9 million), the increased costs related to planned maintenance shutdown of the SAG, Ball, and Regrind mills, and higher grinding media and cyanide costs due to the processing of a harder ore type.\n\nSite Support Costs:\n\nSite support costs in the first nine months of 2019 totaled $35.3 million compared to $37.8 million in the comparative year, due primarily to fewer contractors on site and lower camp supply costs.\n\nCost of sales\n\nCost of sales, which include non-cash DD&A associated with the ounces sold, was $304.7 million for the first nine months of 2019, an increase of $63.8 million or 26% compared to the same period of 2018, due primarily to the increase in ounces sold and increased depreciation of capitalized stripping.\n\nAll-in Sustaining Costs\n\nAll-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis per ounce soldNG, which excludes revenue-based tax, was $581 per ounce in the first nine months of 2019 compared to $810 per ounce in the same period of 2018. The decrease was mainly due primarily to more ounces of gold sold and lower capitalized stripping. The decrease in capitalized stripping resulted from accessing ore and the cessation of capitalized stripping in cut-back 19 West earlier in 2019 than we accessed ore in cut-back 18 in 2018.\n\nIncluding revenue-based taxes, all-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis per ounce soldNG was $771 per ounce in the first nine months of 2019 compared to $988 per ounce in the same period of 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower all-in sustaining costsNG, partially offset by higher revenue-based taxes resulting from increased sales revenue achieved in the first nine months of 2019.\n\nMount Milligan Mine\n\nThe Mount Milligan Mine is an open pit mine located in north central British Columbia, Canada producing a gold and copper concentrate. Production at Mount Milligan is subject to an arrangement with RGLD AG and Royal Gold, Inc. (together, \u201cRoyal Gold\u201d) pursuant to which Royal Gold is entitled to purchase 35% of the gold produced and 18.75% of the copper production at the Mount Milligan mine for $435 per ounce of gold delivered and 15% of the spot price per metric tonnes of copper delivered (the \u201cMount Milligan Streaming Arrangement\u201d).\n\nRecent Developments\n\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2019 the mill throughput averaged 55,727 tonnes per calendar day (60,455 tonnes per operating day).\n\nWater Update\n\nAs previously noted, the Company received amendments to its environmental assessment certificate to permit access to additional sources of surface water and groundwater until November 30, 2021.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, Mount Milligan continued to access surface water from Philip Lake 1 and Rainbow Creek until October when surface water flows diminished to levels below the levels allowed under our permits.\n\nDuring the summer, surface water flows were augmented by rainier than usual weather in July and August. In addition, Mount Milligan has experienced successes in its groundwater exploration program and expects to bring such groundwater sources on-line in December 2019, subject to receipt of applicable permits which are expected in due course. The Company now expects that, with the additional groundwater wells online and prudent management of water resources through the winter period, the Company should not need to slow production in the first quarter of 2020 to conserve water. However, there can be no assurances regarding groundwater flows, fall precipitation, levels of freezing which could affect Mount Milligan\u2019s water inventory through the winter period.\n\nIn addition, the Company continues to work with relevant stakeholders to identify and evaluate water sources that will best be able to supply Mount Milligan\u2019s mill for the life-of-mine while meeting environmental and other parameters. Formal applications and government review are expected to commence later this year, and will be the subject of discussion with regulators, potentially affected Indigenous groups, local communities and other interested parties. The Company\u2019s expectation is that its updated long-term water source (or sources) should be available after November 2021 for the entire life-of-mine, although there can be no assurance that it will have adequate sources of water over the long term. See \u201cCaution Regarding Forward-Looking Information\u201d.\n\nImpairment\n\nAs part of our annual budget and life of mine process, it was identified that recent cost escalation relating to short and long-term water sourcing requirements, higher maintenance costs, higher than expected labour requirements, and lower mill throughput estimates, among other things, will continue in the short to medium term. This combined with lower than expected gold recoveries resulted in a trigger for an impairment test on Mount Milligan\u2019s long-lived assets.\n\nThe Company has begun a comprehensive technical review of the Mount Milligan mine with the objective of publishing an updated NI 43-101 technical report in the coming months. The extent of any change in reserves and resources cannot be precisely determined until all of the relevant studies and modelling are completed, including studies to optimize the economics of the mine and further work to incorporate results of the Company\u2019s exploration drilling through 2019. However, based upon the work performed in connection with the impairment test, the Company\u2019s expectation is that Mount Milligan\u2019s mineral reserves and resources will be materially reduced.\n\nThe impairment test was performed using the Fair Value Less Costs of Disposal (\u201cFVLCD\u201d) methodology. Specifically, the net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d) of the Mount Milligan CGU was determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis of an indicative life-of-mine (\u201cLOM\u201d) model developed solely for impairment testing purposes. The LOM model is not a NI 43-101 technical report and it does not include the associated detailed engineering; rather, it is Management\u2019s best estimate at this point in time. The LOM model includes the estimated higher cost profile referred to above, updated grade-recovery curves for both gold and copper, an estimate of contained gold and copper metal to be mined and processed over the LOM (not reserves), the cash flows expected to be generated over the LOM, and various other business and economic assumptions. The higher cost profile referred to above, was incorporated in the discounted cash flow analysis used in the impairment test.\n\nIn determining fair value, Management believes that an industry participant would consider the value of resources not included in the LOM model. As such, the Company also included the fair value of the estimated recoverable amount of known resources beyond the LOM model by considering the estimated cash flows per ounce generated in the LOM model.\n\nSome gold companies trade at a market capitalization greater than the net present value (\u201cNPV\u201d) of their expected cash flows. Market participants describe this as a \u201cNAV multiple\u201d, which represents the multiple applied to the NPV to arrive at the trading price. The NAV multiple is generally understood to take account of a variety of additional value factors such as the exploration potential of the mineral property, namely the ability to find and produce more metal than what is currently included in the LOM plan or reserve and resource estimates, and the benefit of gold price optionality. As a result, the Company applied a specific NAV multiple to the NAV based on the NAV multiples observed in the market in recent periods and that Management judged to be appropriate.\n\nThe test concluded that the recoverable amount of the Mount Milligan CGU using the latest LOM model and higher cost profile was lower than its carrying value as at September 1, 2019. This resulted in an impairment charge of $230.5 million to the Statement of Earnings, including the write-down of goodwill of $16.1 million and long-lived assets of $214.4 million, reducing the carrying value of the Mount Milligan CGU to $522.6 million as at September 30, 2019.\n\nAssumptions and Judgments\n\nCalculating the FVLCD requires management to make estimates and assumptions with respect to future production levels and operating, capital and closure costs in the life of mine plans; continued license to operate; future metal prices; foreign exchange rates; discount rates; net asset value multiples, and the value of reserves and resources outside the LOM. Changes in any of the assumptions or estimates used in determining the fair values could impact the impairment analysis and its conclusions.\n\nThe key assumptions used in the impairment test for Mount Milligan are summarized in the table below:\n\n2019 Test Gold price per oz - short-term $1,350 Gold price per oz - long-term $1,300 Copper price per lb - short-term $2.60-$2.80 Copper price per lb - long-term $3.00 Discount rate 8% NAV multiple 1.13\n\nGold prices\n\nManagement estimated gold prices through an analysis of gold forward prices and by considering the average of the most recent market commodity price forecasts from a number of recognized financial analysts.\n\nBeyond Life of Mine\n\nFor the impairment tests, a fair value of $111 to $139 per ounce was included for contained ounces not used in the LOM but deemed to be mineable with a change in the economic or business environment (not resources).\n\nProduction\n\nManagement determined its indicative production profile and total life of mine production based on an updated pit shell estimate developed in the quarter.\n\nDiscount rate\n\nA real after-tax discount rate was based on the Company\u2019s estimated weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the risks associated with Mount Milligan\u2019s cash flow.\n\nReserves and Resources\n\nAs noted above, Mount Milligan has experienced higher unit operating costs than those expected by management. The higher unit costs relate to short and long-term water sourcing requirements, higher maintenance costs, higher than expected labour requirements, and lower mill throughput estimates, among other things, that are expected to continue over the short to medium term. At the same time, Mount Milligan has also experienced lower than expected gold recoveries than those previously anticipated. The Company has begun a comprehensive technical review of mining and milling operations at Mount Milligan which will include updating the mine\u2019s mineral reserve and resource estimates to incorporate all diamond drilling through 2019, the revised unit operating costs, the revised gold recovery estimate, and other technical and economic factors. The Company\u2019s objective is to publish an updated NI 43-101 technical report in the coming months. The extent of any change in mineral reserves and resources cannot be precisely determined until all of the relevant studies and modelling are completed, including studies to optimize the economics of the mine and further work to incorporate results of the Company\u2019s exploration drilling through 2019. However, based upon the work performed in connection with the impairment test, the Company\u2019s expectation is that Mount Milligan\u2019s mineral reserves and resources will be materially reduced.\n\nMount Milligan Operating Results\n\n($ millions, except as noted) Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2019 2018 % Change 2019 2018 % Change Financial Highlights: Gold sales 62.3 44.3 41 % 156.3 108.3 44 % Copper sales 41.4 27.4 51 % 108.9 65.6 66 % Total Revenues 103.7 71.7 45 % 265.2 173.9 53 % Cost of sales (cash) 61.5 48.8 26 % 183.6 119.5 54 % Cost of sales (non-cash) 15.9 10.4 53 % 42.3 25.9 63 % Cost of sales (total) 77.4 59.2 31 % 225.9 145.4 55 % (Loss) earnings from operations (193.5 ) 9.6 (2115 %) (189.5 ) 9.9 (2023 %) Cash provided by (used in) operations 38.7 15.0 158 % 76.6 2.0 3730 % Cash provided by operations before changes in working capital(1) 36.6 18.7 96 % 65.7 33.9 94 % Operating Highlights: Tonnes mined - 000s 10,637 8,192 30 % 29,889 24,793 21 % Tonnes ore mined \u2013 000s 4,948 3,413 45 % 11,924 9,782 22 % Tonnes milled - 000s 5,127 3,754 37 % 12,431 9,803 27 % Mill Head Grade Copper (%) 0.25 % 0.21 % 19 % 0.25 % 0.21 % 18 % Mill Head Grade Gold (g/t) 0.51 0.79 (36 %) 0.52 0.69 (24 %) Copper Recovery - % 80.7 % 78.3 % 3 % 81.7 % 81.1 % 1 % Gold Recovery - % 67.2 % 62.7 % 7 % 67.4 % 63.5 % 6 % Mining costs - total ($/t mined material) $ 2.03 $ 2.40 (15 %) $ 2.11 $ 2.22 (5 %) Milling costs - total ($/t milled material) $ 5.68 $ 7.40 (23 %) $ 7.00 $ 7.53 (7 %) Concentrate Produced (dmt) 48,171 30,123 60 % 117,829 79,137 49 % Payable Gold Produced (oz) (3) 55,355 58,798 (6 %) 137,123 134,722 2 % Payable Copper Produced (000's lbs) (3) 21,229 12,704 67 % 53,066 35,295 50 % Gold Sales (payable oz)(3) 55,935 47,195 19 % 147,099 112,515 31 % Copper Sales (000's payable lbs)(3) 21,907 13,605 61 % 53,129 30,779 73 % Average Realized Price - Gold (combined) - $/oz (1) (2) (3) $ 1,114 $ 947 18 % $ 1,063 $ 964 10 % Average Realized Price - Copper (combined) - $/lb (1) (2) (3) $ 1.89 $ 2.01 (6 %) $ 2.04 $ 2.13 (4 %) Capital Expenditures (sustaining) (1) - cash 7.1 9.0 (20 %) 26.7 32.1 (17 %) Unit Costs: Gold - All in Sustaining costs on a by-product basis - $/oz sold (1) 557 677 (18 %) 763 808 (6 %) Gold - All in Sustaining costs on a by-product basis (including taxes) - $/oz sold (1) 581 695 (16 %) 784 826 (5 %) Gold - All in Sustaining costs on a co-product basis - $/oz sold (1) 766 716 7 % 882 790 12 % Copper - All in Sustaining costs on a co-product basis - $/pound sold (1) 1.36 1.73 (21 %) 1.72 1.89 (9 %)\n\n(1) Non-GAAP measure. See discussion under \u201cNon-GAAP Measures\u201d\n\n(2) The average realized price of gold is a combination of market price paid by third parties and $435 per ounce paid by Royal Gold, while the average realized price of copper is a combination of market price paid by third parties and 15% of the spot price per metric tonne of copper delivered paid by Royal Gold, in each case under the Mount Milligan Streaming Arrangement.\n\n(3) Mount Milligan payable production and sales are presented on a 100% basis (the Mount Milligan Streaming Agreement entitles it to 35% and 18.75% of gold and copper sales, respectively). Under the Mount Milligan Streaming Arrangement, Royal Gold will pay $435 per ounce of gold delivered and 15% of the spot price per metric tonne of copper delivered. Payable production for copper and gold reflects estimated metallurgical losses resulting from handling of the concentrate and payable metal deductions, subject to metal content, levied by smelters. The current payable percentage applied is approximately 95% for copper and 97.5% for gold, which may be revised on a prospective basis after a sufficient history of payable amounts is determined.\n\nThird Quarter 2019 compared to Third Quarter 2018\n\nFinancial\n\nLosses from operations was $193.5 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to earnings from operations of $9.6 million in the prior year period, the decrease was due to a $230.5 million impairment charge. Cash provided by operations was $23.7 million higher in 2019 when compared to 2018 due the increase in revenue. In the third quarter of 2019, Mount Milligan recognized $32.0 million in additional revenue when compared to the same prior year period as a result of more concentrate shipments during the period and higher gold prices, offset in part by lower copper prices.\n\nProduction\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, ore and waste mining activities were mainly in phases 3 and 4 of the main open pit. Overburden and waste rock mining continued in phase 8 of the Southern Star Pit through the third quarter of 2019 while topsoil stripping continued in the higher benches and along the perimeters of the Southern Star Pit. Total waste and ore mined in the third quarter of 2019 was 10.6 million tonnes and total material moved was 11.7 million tonnes. In the comparative quarter of 2018, total waste and ore mined was 8.2 million tonnes and total material moved was 9.1 million tonnes. Mine production averaged 127,526 tonnes per day compared to 98,543 tonnes per day in the comparative quarter of 2018. The increase primarily due to the higher availability of the mill, as well as improvements in hauling fleet productivity.\n\nTotal mill throughput was 5.1 million tonnes in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 3.8 million tonnes in the same quarter of 2018. In the current quarter, mill throughput averaged 55,727 tonnes per calendar day (60,455 tonnes per operating day), compared to 40,805 tonnes per calendar day (55,052 tonnes per operating day) in the same prior year period. The increased throughput was due to increased mill and water availability.\n\nFor the third quarter of 2019, 48.2 thousand tonnes of concentrate was produced, representing a 60% increase as compared to the same period of 2018. Gold production in the third quarter of 2019 was 55,355 ounces compared to 58,798 ounces in the comparative prior year period due to 36% lower gold grades. Total copper production was 21.2 million pounds in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 12.7 million pounds in the comparative prior year period, due to higher throughput and higher copper grades.\n\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/5199f1b9-1081-4bed-9741-a256138c4166\n\nMining costs totaled $17.1 million in the third quarter of 2019, which was $2.5 million higher than the comparative prior year period. The increase in mining costs includes higher labour costs including a new employee health tax, higher in-pit drilling and more fuel costs due to higher consumption with more material moved.\n\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/18dcca75-a371-4b01-a713-4658cb018239\n\nMilling costs totaled $29.1 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $27.8 million in the prior year period. The increase in milling costs was primarily due to higher mill throughput and slightly higher labour cost, partially offset by lower SAG mill and primary crusher maintenance costs.\n\nSite support costs\n\nSite support costs in the third quarter of 2019 totaled $11.9 million versus $10.9 million in the comparative prior year period, primarily due to higher royalty costs as a result of sales. This was partially offset by certain leasing costs being capitalized.\n\nCost of sales:\n\nCost of sales in the third quarter of 2019 was $77.4 million compared to $59.2 million in the same quarter of 2018 due to higher sales volume.\n\nAll-in Sustaining Costs:\n\nAll-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis per ounce sold NG, which excludes taxes, were $557 per ounce for the third quarter of 2019 compared to $677 per ounce in the third quarter of 2018 due to more gold ounces sold and higher copper credits, partially offset by higher operating cost.\n\nIncluding income taxes, all-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis per ounce soldNG were $581 per ounce in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $695 per ounce in the same period of 2018.\n\nFirst Nine Months 2019 compared to First Nine Months 2018\n\nFinancial:\n\nMount Milligan recognized $91.3 million in higher revenues in 2019 when compared to 2018 as a result of higher gold and copper sales. The losses from operations totaled $189.5 million during the first nine months of 2019 and was $199.4 million lower than the same prior year period, due primarily to a $230.5 million impairment charge and higher mining and milling costs, offset by higher sales. Cash provided by operations increased by $78.6 million in 2019 compared to the same prior year period due a decrease in working capital levels of $46.9 million and higher revenues.\n\nProduction:\n\nDuring the first nine months of 2019, ore mining was from phases 3 and 4 of the main pit, with approximately 67% of ore mined from phase 3. Waste mined during the first nine months of 2019 was primarily from phase 4 in the MBX Pit and phase 8 in the Southern Star Pit. In phase 8, mining continued to focus on developing the upper benches, including waste rock mining as well as overburden and topsoil stripping. Total waste and ore mined in the first nine months of 2019 was 29.9 million tonnes and total tonnes moved was 32.3 million. In the comparative period of 2018, total waste and ore mined was 24.8 million tonnes and lower total tonnes moved at 26.6 million tonnes. Mine production averaged 118,172 tonnes per day moved for the first nine months of 2019 while 97,457 tonnes per day was moved in the comparative period of 2018. The increase in tonnes mined and moved in 2019 were primarily due to the higher mill throughput with the increased availability of water and higher mine fleet productivity.\n\nTotal mill throughput was 12.4 million tonnes in the first nine months of 2019 compared to 9.8 million tonnes in the same period of 2018. In the first nine months of 2019, mill throughput averaged 45,535 tonnes per calendar day (50,721 tonnes per operating day), compared to 35,910 tonnes per calendar day (47,996 tonnes per operating day) in the first nine months of 2018 due to the increased water availability resulting in the mill reaching full operational capacity earlier in 2019 than 2018.\n\nIn the first nine months of 2019, 117.8 thousand tonnes of concentrate was produced, representing a 49% increase as compared to the comparative prior period, due primarily to the earlier availability of water in 2019. In the first nine months of 2019, total payable gold and copper production was 137,123 ounces and 53.1 million pounds, respectively, compared to 134,722 ounces of gold and 35.3 million pounds of copper in the first nine months of 2018.\n\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/1db6e38f-118a-401b-9a28-1fbb41bc0dc2\n\nMining costs were $49.2 million in the first nine months of 2019, $7.4 million higher than the comparative prior year period. The increase is due primarily to higher spending on mining fleet maintenance, labour cost inflation, including a new employee health tax and higher fuel consumption as a result of more tonnes moved.\n\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/02162514-c40a-4c62-aebb-5dddeff4ad2f\n\nMilling costs totaled $87.0 million in the first nine months of 2019 compared to $73.8 million in the comparative prior year period, which included standby costs of $10.8 million. The increase in operating costs was mainly due to higher mill throughput, labour cost inflation and a new employee health tax, partially offset by lower maintenance costs from timing of plant technical shutdown.\n\nSite support costs:\n\nSite support costs (including royalties) in the first nine months of 2019 totaled $34.5 million versus $32.0 million in the comparative prior year period. The increase reflects higher royalty costs due to higher sales, and other costs, including labour cost inflation, partially offset by certain leasing costs being capitalized.\n\nCost of sales:\n\nCost of sales in the first nine months of 2019 was $225.9 million compared to $145.4 million in the same period of 2018 due to higher sales volume.\n\nAll-in Sustaining Costs:\n\nAll-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis per ounce sold NG, which excludes income taxes, was $763 per ounce for the first nine months of 2019 compared to $808 per ounce in the comparative prior year period. The unit cost decrease was due primarily to the increase in gold ounces sold and higher copper credits, partially offset by higher operating costs.\n\nIncluding income taxes, all-in sustaining costs after tax on a by-product basis per ounce sold NG was $784 per ounce for the first nine months of 2019 compared to $826 per ounce in the first nine months of 2018.\n\nMolybdenum Business\n\nThe molybdenum business includes two North American primary molybdenum mines that are currently on care and maintenance: the Thompson Creek Mine (\"TC Mine\") (mine and mill) in Idaho and the 75%-owned Endako Mine (mine, mill and roaster) in British Columbia. The molybdenum business also includes the Langeloth metallurgical roasting facility (the \"Langeloth Facility\") in Pennsylvania. TC Mine operates a molybdenum beneficiation circuit to treat molybdenum concentrates to supplement the concentrate feed sourced directly for the Langeloth Facility. This beneficiation process allows the Company to process high copper content molybdenum concentrate purchased from third parties, which is then transported from TC Mine to the Langeloth Facility for further processing.\n\nThe molybdenum business provides tolling treatment services for customers by converting molybdenum concentrates to molybdenum oxide powder and briquettes and ferromolybdenum products. Additionally, molybdenum concentrates are also purchased to convert to upgraded products which are then sold in the metallurgical and chemical markets.\n\nMolybdenum Operating Results\n\n($ millions, except as noted) Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2019 2018 % Change 2019 2018 % Change Financial Highlights: Molybdenum (Mo) Sales - $ millions 48.7 43.0 13 % 164.0 144.3 14 % Tolling, Calcining and Other 1.4 1.6 (8 %) 6.6 6.5 1 % Total Revenues and Other Income 50.1 44.6 12 % 170.6 150.8 13 % Cost of sales - cash 46.5 41.8 11 % 164.5 139.0 18 % Cost of sales - non-cash 0.9 3.5 (75 %) 3.3 6.1 (46 %) Cost of Sales - Total 47.4 45.3 5 % 167.8 145.1 16 % Care and Maintenance costs - Molybdenum mines 2.7 1.5 80 % 10.3 6.7 54 % Loss from operations (1.0 ) (3.1 ) (68 %) (10.7 ) (3.7 ) 185 % Total capital expenditure 3.5 0.3 958 % 4.3 0.8 472 % Cash provided by (used in) operations 2.1 (5.0 ) (142 %) 1.7 (14.7 ) (112 %) Cash provided by (used in) operations, before changes in working capital(NG) 1.3 (0.4 ) (425 %) (2.8 ) 2.5 (212 %) Production Highlights (000's lbs): Mo purchased 4,347 3,967 10 % 13,056 11,926 9 % Mo roasted 3,990 4,047 (1 %) 14,149 12,271 15 % Mo sold 3,641 3,409 7 % 12,458 11,476 9 % Toll roasted and upgraded Mo 1,089 1,242 (12 %) 4,287 4,017 7 %\n\nThird Quarter 2019 compared to Third Quarter 2018\n\nIn the third quarter of 2019 and 2018, 4.0 million pounds of molybdenum were roasted.
