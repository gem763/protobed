These memos were given to a friend of Comey\u2019s who then leaked them to The New York Times. This was done to get the things rolling for a special counsel appointment, which happened; Robert Mueller headed a two-year investigation that revealed zero evidence to prove there was a Trump-Russia collusion conspiracy. Katie has more:\n\nDepartment of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz released an 83-page long report Thursday morning about misconduct by fired FBI Director James Comey. It thoroughly berates Comey for leaking memos about conversations with President Trump for personal and political gain. Most importantly, the report concludes Comey improperly released FBI material in order to launch the Special Counsel investigation into the 2016 presidential election. This report is separate from the highly anticipated IG report about the origins of the Russia investigation and FISA abuse. Comey admitted during sworn congressional testimony in 2017 that he purposely leaked the confidential memos to a friend, who then gave them to the New York Times.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal editorial board nailed the results of the IG report. Comey thought the rules didn\u2019t apply to him. Also, it showed that Trump was right to fire him in May of 2017:\n\nBy not safeguarding sensitive information\u201d and \u201cby using it to create public pressure for official action,\u201d Mr. Comey \u201cset a dangerous example\u201d for every FBI employee, the IG says. Mr. Comey admitted that he violated the rules to cause the appointment of a special counsel after Mr. Trump fired him in May 2017. \u201cComey said he was compelled to take these actions \u2018if I love this country . . . and I love the Department of Justice, and I love the FBI,\u2019\u201d the report says. But the IG concludes that if everyone violated the rules \u201cto achieve a personally desired outcome\u201d as Mr. Comey did, \u201cthe FBI would be unable to dispatch its law enforcement duties properly.\u201d Translated from the bureaucratic prose: Mr. Comey thought he was above the rules because he wanted to save the country from Mr. Trump. No doubt J. Edgar Hoover felt a similar afflatus as he wiretapped Martin Luther King. [\u2026] These violations may not be crimes, and the Justice Department declined to prosecute after referral by the IG. But they are unacceptable in someone who had Mr. Comey\u2019s authority and has made his career assailing others for lesser offenses. They show again why Mr. Trump was right to fire him.\n\nComey\u2019s termination started the \u2018Trump obstructed justice\u2019 nonsense that\u2019s still prevalent among liberals today, as is the Russia collusion myth. This president has broken the minds of liberal America.", "description": ".09/02/2019 3:01:04AM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/355/c3dd54ba-d8e4-451b-be9a-46d143e195dd.png"}
