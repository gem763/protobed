The non-partisan agency says it's setting up a polling station at the University of Winnipeg Wesley Hall and is providing shuttle services from RBC Centre in Winnipeg to the university.\n\nFamilies moved out of the Lake Manitoba First Nation load their belongings onto a bus outside a hotel in Winnipeg, on Oct. 14, 2019. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)\n\n\"Over the past few days, Elections Canada has been communicating with political parties about the unprecedented measures we are taking to adapt to the extraordinary events that took place in Manitoba,\" said spokesperson Matthew McKenna.\n\n\"Our ultimate goal, as always, is to do everything we can so that electors can cast their ballot.\"\n\nSpecial ballots for hydro workers\n\nHowever, Manitoba Hydro has said evacuees could start returning home soon, which the NDP worries could complicate the window for voting.\n\n\"To be clear: it is unrealistic to believe that these displaced electors \u2013 who have been away from home for approximately a week, many without their own vehicles \u2013 could get from the outskirts of Winnipeg to downtown Winnipeg to vote, then get back to their hotels and commence the long trip back to their communities,\" wrote Atkinson.\n\nElections Canada says it's also prepared to welcome electors at their assigned polling stations in their communities on Monday.\n\n\"We have worked with local partners and returning officers to recruit dozens of additional staff in the affected communities and Winnipeg,\" said McKenna.\n\nElections Canada is already making some accommodations to make sure hundreds of Manitoba Hydro workers can vote near job sites Monday while they're out in the field trying to restore power. The deadline to submit votes by special ballot was Oct. 15, but the organization made an exception for hydro workers.\n\n\"Clearly, it is both logistically and operationally possible to provide accessible alternative voting methods on Election Day to ensure people have reasonable access to this important election, notwithstanding this disaster,\" said Atkinson.\n\nElections Canada also said some polling stations in the affected communities could have reduced hours of operation on election day due to power outages.
