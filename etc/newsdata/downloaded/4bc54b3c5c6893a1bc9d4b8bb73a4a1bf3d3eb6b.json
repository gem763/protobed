The nomination process lasted several hours longer than anticipated as dozens of voters reported they never had a chance to cast a ballot.\n\nDozens of Akbari's supporters claimed they were disqualified for discrepancies with identification listed in the voting system.\n\nMohammed Rahman, Anwar Khan and Fakruz Zaman all told similar stories of being turned away because information in the database, like their date of birth, was either missing or inaccurate.\n\nMy right was taken from me. - Anwar Khan, would-be voter\n\n\"I have a lot of friends here who could not go to vote, too, because the date of birth is not good. That's not right,\" said Zaman.\n\nHe said in his case, his name and address matched what was in the database, so the rationale for turning him away didn't make sense.\n\nKhan also faced a similar problem.\n\n\"I couldn't vote, so that means my right was taken from me\" said Khan. \"This is not a third-world country.\"\n\nAll three said they want the issue looked into, adding the party should be concerned longtime Liberals might be deterred from voting if it's left unresolved.\n\nRiding association president Khatera Akbari, centre, says many of her supporters left 'frustrated and disappointed' following the Liberal party's nomination meeting in the federal riding of Orl\u00e9ans on Sept. 19, 2019.

I know there were many, many people who were frustrated and disappointed.\"\n\nAkbari said while she was unhappy with the loss, she's committed to supporting Lalonde, having canvassed with her during her provincial campaigns.\n\nLalonde will now begin going door-to-door as the official candidate, more than a week after the start of the federal campaign.\n\nShe is running to replace Liberal MP Andrew Leslie, who decided not to run again earlier this year.\n\nLalonde is expected to formally resign from the Ontario legislature Friday. She is the second Liberal MPP from Ottawa to leave Queen's Park this year, after former Ottawa-Vanier MPP Nathalie des Rosiers announced in May she would be taking a position at the University of Toronto.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford will now have to call provincial byelections for the two ridings.\n\nMarie-France Lalonde's departure from Queen's Park means there are now two vacant provincial ridings in Ottawa, and Premier Doug Ford will have to call byelections for both.
