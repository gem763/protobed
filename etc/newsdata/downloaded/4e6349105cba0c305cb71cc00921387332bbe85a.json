Jeurys Familia walked Rhys Hoskins before Miller flied out to deep center field and Brandon Nimmo tried to throw out Harper at third, allowing both runners to advance.\n\nMets manager Mickey Callaway said he would\u2019ve preferred Nimmo\u2019s throw go to second to keep Hoskins at first and the double play in order. With runners now on second and third, Callaway chose to intentionally walk Cesar Hernandez.\n\nKingery understood the strategic move, but it helped spur him on. He lined a 1-0 pitch into the left-center gap to clear the bases.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of the game, obviously, to put the double play in order, but it gives you a little extra motivation to want to get a big hit there,\u201d Kingery said. \u201cSo just go up there with your plan and try to execute it.\u201d\n\nPete Alonso hit his 43rd homer and Wilson Ramos extended his hitting streak to 25 games with a fourth-inning double for the Mets, who are four games behind the Cubs.\n\n\u201cWe had a good opportunity today, but we still won the series,\u201d Alonso said.\n\nHector Neris (3-5) got the final five outs for Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cWe leaned heavily on Hector and he delivered,\u201d manager Gabe Kapler said.\n\nNew York tied it in the eighth when Nimmo, playing in his first game since May 20 due to a neck injury, scored from third on a wild pitch by Neris during a crazy inning.\n\nThe Mets put runners on second and third with one out for Jeff McNeil, who entered Sunday batting .326. But his slump reached 0 for 13 when he grounded to Hoskins at first base and he threw out pinch-runner Rajai Davis at the plate.\n\nDavis slid headfirst on the play and took out the legs of veteran umpire Joe West, who ended up laying on Davis for several seconds before finally being helped up by Neris and calling Davis out.\n\nNeris was brought in after Mike Morin allowed the first two batters to reach before Luis Guillorme\u2019s sacrifice bunt advanced both runners.\n\nFOR STARTERS\n\nPhillies starter Zach Eflin pitched seven stellar innings, allowing only Alonso\u2019s first-inning homer and two other hits. But Kapler elected to pinch-hit for Eflin in the seventh with Philadelphia ahead 2-1 even though the right-hander had thrown just 84 pitches.\n\nMets starter Marcus Stroman also pitched well, giving up two runs on seven hits with six strikeouts and two walks in six-plus innings. Stroman was lifted after Adam Haseley\u2019s leadoff double in the seventh.\n\nMILLER TIME\n\nMiller was a late addition to the lineup after shortstop Jean Segura was scratched due to the death of his grandmother.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nMets: 2B Robinson Cano, on the injured list since Aug. 5 with a torn left hamstring, is planning a second rehab start Monday at Class A Brooklyn. If all goes well, Cano told reporters after Saturday\u2019s game that he could join the Mets as early as Tuesday.\n\nPhillies: OF Jay Bruce was reinstated from the 10-day IL. Out since Aug. 9 with a left flexor strain, Bruce was batting .250 with 10 homers and 29 RBIs in 34 games with Philadelphia. He grounded out while batting for Eflin in the seventh.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMets: Open a three-game set in Washington on Monday afternoon. RHP Noah Syndergaard (9-7, 4.14 ERA) will look to bounce back from his last start against the Cubs when he allowed a career-high 10 runs (nine earned) in three innings. RHP Joe Ross (3-3, 5.36) goes for the Nationals.\n\nPhillies: LHP Drew Smyly (2-6, 6.95) opposes Reds RHP Anthony DeSciafani (9-7, 4.05) in the first of four games at Cincinnati.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The New York Mets gave Scott Kingery some extra motivation to get a big hit, and he made them pay.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Aaron Bracy"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/01/mets_phillies_baseball_43323_c0-189-4517-2822_s1770x1032.jpg?1a948bc8896e9e8349b50797ec0784caa1a73426"}
