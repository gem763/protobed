The winners are far outpacing the losers at this point, and the past month has been solid\n\nTranche 1, released last Dec. 10, is up about 17.7% versus 12.9% for the S&P 500 and 6.9% for the Russell 2000. Winnebago Industries Inc. (WGO) (up 123%) has solidified its position as the top overall performer courtesy of last Wednesday's better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings release and 15% rise that day. Kraft Heinz (KHC) (down 43%) can't seem to shake off a horrible year and remains in the doldrums, trading at 11x next year's consensus estimates and yielding 5.6%. Following a solid but short-lived uptick last month, United Natural Foods Inc. (UNFI) (down 50%) cratered after reporting worse-than-expected fourth-quarter results. General Mills Inc. (GIS) (up 36%) gave back some ground after posting mixed first-quarter results.\n\nTranche 2, released last Dec. 12, is up 13.9% on average after a very solid month, and is now better than the S&P 500 (up 12.8%) and Russell 2000 (up 9.4%). Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY) (up 20%) was the catalyst here, rising about 40% since last month's update. Part of that bump was due to the hiring a former Target Corp. (TGT) executive as its new CEO, announced Oct. 10, which provided a 22% boost. Kronos Worldwide Inc. (KR) (up 15%) and Groupon Inc. (GRPN) (down 0.3%) were flat for the month.\n\nTranche 3, released last Dec. 14, is up an average of 44.7%, better than the S&P 500 (up 12.3%) and Russell 2000 (up 8.5%) after a solid month. This improvement primarily was driven by the performance of PetMed Express Inc. (PETS) (up 18%), which rose 40% since the last update due largely to better-than-expected second-quarter results. Boise Cascade (BCC) (up 53%) had another solid month, rising 16% on no news. Skechers U.S.A. Inc (SKX) (up 61%) was also up for the month despite taking some heat last week after better-than-expected second-quarter results were muted by weaker earnings guidance. Methode Electronics Inc. (MEI) (up 47%) was down slightly over the month but remains a solid performer overall.\n\nBy way of reminder, qualifying companies had to meet the following criteria:\n\nDown at least 30% year to date,\n\nForward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios below 15 in the next two fiscal years\n\nMinimum market cap $100 million\n\nThe resulting list was then whittled down from 200 to 12 and released in three tranches of four names each in mid-December.", "description": "A handful of standouts among the dozen stocks that make up Jonathan Heller's 2018 Tax-Loss Selling Recovery Portfolio pushed the group higher over the last month....WGO", "authors": ["Jonathan Heller", "This Portfolio Of Lovable Losers Puts On A Year-End Sprint", "A Handful Of Standouts Among The Dozen Stocks That Make Up The Tax-Loss Selling Recovery Portfolio Pushed The Group Higher Over The Last Month.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Timothy Collins", "Jim Cramer", "Peter Tchir", "Bruce Kamich"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/89669d5b-e5dc-11e9-848d-5b809905cf3d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
