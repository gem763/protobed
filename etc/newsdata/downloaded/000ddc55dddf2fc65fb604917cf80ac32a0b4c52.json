Does anybody know what that is?\u201d she asked, to which most of the audience \u2014 including Mr. Weinstein \u2014 remained silent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Freddy Krueger in the room, if you will. I didn\u2019t know we had to bring our own mace and rape whistles to Actors\u2019 Hour,\u201d she said, which prompted loud boos from the back of the room and one call to \u201cShut up!\u201d\n\n\u201cI have been raped, surprisingly by no one in this room,\u201d she continued. \u201cJust a general f\u2013 you to who I\u2019m talking about.\u201d\n\nMs. Bachman was referring to Mr. Weinstein, a Hollywood producer accused of sexually assaulting or harassing more than 80 women, and she and two other comedians were later kicked out of the bar after they confronted Mr. Weinstein at his table directly.\n\n\u201cWe have to make a choice whether to be implicit or not,\u201d Ms. Bachman said to The Washington Post. \u201cI want nothing to do with anyone that celebrates a monster. That doesn\u2019t feel like it should be a very controversial opinion. That\u2019s not a gray area.\u201d\n\nA representative for Mr. Weinstein blasted the performers in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, calling them out for making a scene when he was \u201cout with friends enjoying the music.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis scene was uncalled for, downright rude and an example of how due process today is being squashed by the public, trying to take it away in the courtroom too,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cAccusations are, in fact, not convictions.\u201d\n\nMr. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to two charges of predatory sexual assault and faces a criminal trial scheduled for January. He will later face five other felony charges, for which he also has pleaded not guilty.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
