The auction, which is being presented by Lark Mason Associates, will include nearly 200 lots that will be divided into categories the auction house says reflect Bourdain\u2019s many interests: travel, film, art, cooking, writing and culture.\n\nProceeds from the sale will go to Bourdain\u2019s family and a new scholarship created in his honor at his alma mater, The Culinary Institue of America. The Anthony Bourdain Legacy Scholarship will be awarded to students interested in following in the chef\u2019s footsteps by studying abroad or enrolling in one of the school\u2019s international programs.\n\nThe knife was custom made for Bourdain by former chef and master knifemaker Bob Kramer. \u201cIt took years of waiting,\u201d Bourdain wrote in 2016 when he received the knife. \u201cI might have to go back to working brunch shifts to afford it.\u201d\n\nOther items of note include a chrome duck press, the Midcentury Modern desk where Bourdain wrote, an original typed manuscript or early draft of his first novel and a jacket given to the chef by the Navy.\n\nAccording to the Times, Bourdain and his \u201cNo Reservations\u201d production team were evacuated out of Beirut, Lebanon, in 2006 during the conflict with Israel by way of the cruiser Nashville, where sailors presented him with a jacket affixed with a special patch featuring kitchen knives.\n\nItems for sale will be available for preview online starting Oct. 2. Exhibitions will be shown in New York City; Savannah, Georgia; and New Braunfels, Texas, from Oct. 9 to 30.", "description": "Prized possessions that belonged to the late chef and writer will be sold at auction next month.", "authors": ["Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7fe28a2300001005551a23.jpeg?cache=tfxpzij86a&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
