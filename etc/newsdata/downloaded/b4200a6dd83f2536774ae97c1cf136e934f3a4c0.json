USA TODAY\n\nSpoiler alert: This post contains plot details of Andre Aciman's \"Find Me,\" the sequel to \"Call Me By Your Name.\"\n\nElio may have been the protagonist in Andre Aciman's 2007 novel \"Call Me by Your Name,\" but in the book's sequel, \"fate\" is the character you're going to be most invested in.\n\n\"You know, life is not so original after all,\" one character tells another in \"Find Me,\" (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 261 pp., \u2605\u2605\u2605 out of four), out Tuesday, Oct. 29. \"It has uncanny ways of reminding us that, even without a God, there is a flash of retrospective brilliance in the way fate plays its cards.\"\n\nAciman has indeed laid all his cards on the proverbial table, answering questions about some of the original novel's characters (yes, both Elio and Oliver) but deftly dodging others. It\u2019s almost like \u201cFind Me\u201d was the book Aciman really wanted to write all along, but first you needed all the pieces of the puzzle to get there.\n\n\"Find Me\" is the perfect sequel to \"Call Me by Your Name\" \u2013 lustful, introspective and magical \u2013 though it is a work that requires readers to suspend disbelief almost to a fault.\n\n\"Find Me,\" by Andr\u00e9 Aciman. (Photo: Farrar, Straus and Giroux)\n\n'Find Me' doubles down on age gaps in relationships\n\n\u201cFind Me\u201d has everything you loved \u2013 and everything that made you cringe \u2013 about \u201cCall Me by Your Name.\"\n\nIt fills in its predecessor's gaps. We see characters 10, 15 and 20 years into the future. The themes of \"fate\" and \"time\" fly above each story: like doves (romantic entanglements that transcend convention) and like daggers (the reminder that time is often not on our side). But we don\u2019t have only Elio\u2019s voice to rely on this time: We have Sami's and Oliver\u2019s voices, too.\n\nMore: 5 books not to miss: Jami Attenberg's 'All This Could Be Yours,' John le Carr\u00e9 spy novel\n\nSami, who we find out has since divorced Elio's mother, meets a woman half his age by chance on a train. Their chemistry grows undeniable. The way he first speaks to her, however \u2013 asking her why she looks so \"glum\" \u2013 reads uncomfortably.\n\nOne can\u2019t help but cringe when considering this exchange and other moments through a #MeToo-era lens \u2013 not to mention that there are no female narrators. This unbalanced power dynamic isn\u2019t fully explored, something Aciman also didn't unpack in the first novel (Elio is 17 and Oliver is 24, controversial in its own right). And the age gaps don't stop there. In the middle of the novel, Elio begins a romance with a man twice his age.\n\nAciman\u2019s languid, rhythmic writing does an excellent job distracting you from what might otherwise give you pause; the \"Find Me\" romances are sensual and gripping. He writes like a cross-country runner: He slows and speeds pacing but never loses sight of the finish line. That question, though, of whether the \"Find Me\" romances should exist, doesn\u2019t quite go away.\n\nAs with \"Call Me by Your Name,\" \"Find Me\" also fails to address the HIV/AIDS crisis in any way. The world Aciman has created seems to exist outside of time. It's not that every novel must reflect the state of the world in which its published. But when a work of art is altogether strong, it's that much more frustrating when individual pieces don't quite shine.\n\nShould I read 'Find Me' if I've only seen the 'Call Me by Your Name' movie?\n\nIf you\u2019ve only seen the film version of \u201cCall Me by Your Name,\u201d this book is not for you. The film's ending is, appropriately enough, more cinematic, with Elio crying by the fireplace after finding out Oliver is getting married. It makes sense for the viewer to see Elio grieve a lost love just as his father said he should. The book, however, ends quite differently.\n\n\"Find Me\" has every bit of romantic tension as \u201cCall Me by Your Name,\u201d but is even more frustrating because all you want is to have Elio and Oliver at least in the same room together (and you don't get that until the final section). In that sense, the book achieves what it\u2019s set out to do: Make you wait 20 years before \"finding\" that person you\u2019re supposed to be with after all.\n\nMovie review: 'Call Me By Your Name' is a first-love story to savor\n\nFor family dysfunction: Family dysfunction is at its finest in Jami Attenberg\u2019s devastating \u2018All This Could Be Yours\u2019\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2019/10/21/call-me-your-name-sequel-find-me-review-lustful-frustrating/3972000002/", "description": "Elio may have been the protagonist in \"Call Me By Your Name\" \u2013 but in the book's sequel, \"fate\" is the character you're going to be most invested in.", "authors": ["David Oliver", "J.K.
