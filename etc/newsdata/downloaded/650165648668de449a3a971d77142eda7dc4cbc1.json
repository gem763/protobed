China used to be the biggest importer of recyclable materials globally. It took 30 million tonnes of the world\u2019s waste each year, including from Australia. It largely banned it overnight. Australia will need to build its own recycling facilities to dispose of the waste appropriately.\n\nMitchell says: \"It\u2019s becoming a social imperative that more is done with waste. The call for more to be done on sustainability and recycling is growing louder within the community. We believe Australians are becoming more accepting of paying for the cost of sustainability.\u201d\n\nEmma Fisher, portfolio manager at Airlie Funds Management, says: \"The waste management industry is increasingly focused on building out critical recycling infrastructure. The issue for the whole waste supply chain is that the cheapest way of doing things is usually the worst for the environment (ie, landfill). So it requires government intervention, in the form of levies on the cost of disposing a tonne of waste into a landfill, to adjust the playing field and allow for investment in recycling assets.\u201d\n\nThe graph also shows the growth in recycling over a decade, with compound annual growth of 2.4 per cent a year.\n\nLandfill levies collected by the NSW government alone are approaching $1 billion a year and are increasing. Australia recycles or converts waste to energy for about 50 per cent of waste according to Mitchell, so is considered middle of the pack by global standards compared with the US or developed European peers, where this figure is about 80 per cent-plus. Mitchell sees government landfill levies as a potential revenue pool for waste management companies able to divert waste from landfill.\n\nFisher points to Cleanaway\u2019s joint venture with Macquarie\u2019s Green Investment Group for a Western Sydney plant that will convert waste to energy as an example of business diverting waste from landfill. This plant is likely to have the capacity to cut landfill volumes by 500 kilotonnes a year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe biggest risks of investing in this sector would seem to be regulatory. There is a lack of cohesion between state governments, which results in the waste industry being different in every state. Landfill levies can vary significantly and until recently Queensland didn\u2019t charge a landfill levy, which caused large movements of NSW waste to be shipped across the border. Lack of uniformity in bin sizes across states increases costs as trucks need to be designed differently for each state.\n\nMitchell believes that governments are slowly realising that more needs to be done, particularly with greater national cohesion. He notes there is now a federal minister for waste reduction.\n\nThe ASX is home to one of the world's largest listed waste management companies Cleanaway (formerly Transpacific Industries), and Bingo Industries is a relatively new addition. Mitchell is attracted to Cleanaway as \u201cwe like the more stable and defensive earnings streams (mainly municipal and commercial) whereas Bingo operates in the more volatile/cyclical building and demolition space. There are also a lot lower barriers to entry in [Bingo's] part of the market.\"\n\nAlthough most investors would associate waste management with garbage collection, the future lies in the recycling of waste.", "description": "Although most investors would associate waste management with garbage collection, the future lies in the recycling of waste.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1886%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d9486ccfc7fd51bf7af7ed74a6f95e47a263e8ca", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
