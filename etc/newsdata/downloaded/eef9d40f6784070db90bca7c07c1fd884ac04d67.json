It also has plenty of libraries, allowing developers to interface with machine-learning frameworks like Google-developed TensorFlow, and the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK).\n\nMicrosoft has also been building better support for Python in its Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor, so that developers can use VS Code on their local PC to edit code stored on remote machines, containers, and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) operating systems.\n\nMicrosoft's own Python extension for VS Code is its most popular extension in the company's marketplace for developers. VS Code itself has also become hugely popular with developers. And as part of its focus on AI, the company has made VS Code available as part of the popular Anaconda Python distribution.\n\nBut the main apparent benefit is that Microsoft can expand the population of Python developers using Azure for building AI applications.\n\nSEE: Programming language popularity: Python tightens its grip at the top\n\nThere's already support for Python in Azure Machine Learning Studio, and in August the company announced full Azure Machine Learning support for PyTorch 1.2, a machine-learning framework for Python from Facebook's AI research group.\n\nThe new course features a number of 'quick start' tutorials, such as one teaching users how to detect human faces in an image using the Azure Face API and Python.\n\nAnother tutorial teaches users how to use the Computer Vision REST API. Both are part of Microsoft's Cognitive Services.\n\nMore on programming languages", "description": "Microsoft's new free video course helps aspiring programmers learn Python... and then build AI apps on Azure.", "authors": ["Liam Tung"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/20/8b171262-578a-4633-a719-e08269bd048c/thumbnail/770x578/3ead3ac21375b562b7f35f90d89bb715/glassesscreenistock-936987096.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
