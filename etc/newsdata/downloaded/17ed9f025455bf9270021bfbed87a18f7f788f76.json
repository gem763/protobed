Every conversation we have is based on the long-term.\"\n\nWhile the Saudis have not commented on the latest reports, officials from the kingdom previously dismissed claims that they were interested in buying the Premier League giants as \"completely false.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Saudi crown prince NOT plotting Man Utd takeover bid, minister says\n\nWoodward, along with the Glazers, are deeply unpopular figures among the Old Trafford faithful. Sections of the club's fanbase see Woodward's transfer policy (or lack thereof) as being central to the club's downward spiral since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, along with former chief executive David Gill.\n\nSince that change at boardroom level, the resounding success enjoyed by Ferguson has ground to a halt and forced the club to appoint a revolving door of different managers in bids to arrest the decline, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer being the latest man in the hot-seat.\n\nDespite a heartening 1-1 draw with the previously rampant league leaders Liverpool on Sunday, the Norwegian's two Premier League wins so far this season suggests further change could be ahead for the famous club.\n\nAlso on rt.com Liverpool snatch late draw at Manchester Utd but Klopp's men see record bid end\n\nWoodward appears to agree that United have disappointed during his reign, saying to Sky Sports: \"But we have to do everything we possibly can to get back to winning the Premier League. We are not successful until we do. Second is not success - we have to win the Premier League.\"", "description": "Manchester United executive Ed Woodward says the club's current owners, the Glazer family, are not considering selling their stake despite renewed reports of interest from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5dad88082030272f2847f478.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
