I think we owe it to our fans that we can't put younger players here if they're not going to have success or they're going to lose their confidence.\"\n\nNamestnikov likes 'fresh start'\n\nNamestnikov, 26, has 66 goals and 92 assists in 362 career NHL games with the Tampa Bay Lightning and the Rangers. He set career highs with 22 goals and 48 points in 81 games between Tampa Bay and New York in 2017-18.\n\nThe transition to New York didn't go as well as Namestnikov would have liked and, as such, the trade didn't come as a big surprise.\n\n\"It's a new, fresh start for me,\" said Namestnikov. \"It's a young team here and lots of potential so I'm really excited.\"\n\nNamestnikov was on the ice Tuesday for practice and playing on the left wing with Artem Anisimov and Connor Brown.\n\nNamestnikov has played with Anisimov for Russia at the world championship and World Cup.\n\n\"It's a fast, fast team and I think I can bring that element as well,\" Namestnikov said. \"I think I'm a reliable two-way forward that can skate and fit in with the young guys here.\"\n\nNamestnikov also knows fellow Russian Senators Nikita Zaitsev and Vitaly Abramov, and played with Ottawa's Chris Tierney when both were with the Ontario Hockey League's London Knights. He also trains in the off-season with injured Senators defenceman Christian Wolanin.\n\nHead coach D.J Smith saw Namestnikov play for London when he coached the OHL's Oshawa Generals. Smith feels his defensive side of the game has matured during his time in the NHL.\n\n\"He's a player that can play in all situations and he'll get that opportunity here and he's done it before,\" said Smith. \"I think his game has really come around. He was an offensive player in junior when I watched him play and then he's really learned to play the defensive side of the game in the NHL. As you can see [from practice], he has some skill and some quickness and he'll make us a better team.\"\n\nWith the addition of Namestnikov, the Senators now have four of the 33 Russians playing in the league.\n\nThe Senators return to action Thursday against the visiting St. Louis Blues.", "description": "Forward Vladislav Namestnikov\u00a0has been\u00a0acquired by the Senators in a trade with the New York Rangers on Monday night for defenceman Nick Ebert and Ottawa's fourth-round pick in the 2021 NHL Draft.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5313872.1570566407!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/namestnikov-vladislav-040319.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
