This will help reduce energy costs, protect employee health and minimize impacts to the environment.\u201d\n\nBorden has recently received full permission to operate in Ontario having signed Partnership Agreements with local First Nations who inhabit the land where the project intends to mine for gold ore.\n\nOre from the Borden Gold Project will be sent for processing at their mill in the town of Timmins, about 112 miles to the east.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDue in part to Borden\u2019s use of safe and sustainable mining, the Canadian and Ontario governments both granted $5 million (in Canadian dollars) towards electrification of the mine, according to Newmont Goldcorp press release on Monday.\n\nThe move is part of a larger gold mining expansion effort by Newmont, which has successfully built 11 new mines, expansions and projects on four continents over the last six years:\n\nAkyem Gold Project in Ghana and the Phoenix Copper Leach in Project in Nevada in 2013\n\nThe Turf Vent Shaft in Nevada in 2015\n\nThe Merian and Long Canyon Mine in Nevada in 2016\n\nThe Tanami Expansion in Australia in 2017\n\nThe Twin Underground, Northwest Exodus and Subika Underground in Ghana in 2018\n\nAustralia's Tanami Power Project in 2019.\n\nNewmont Goldcorp, which currently holds the distinction of having the strongest and most sustainable portfolio in the gold sector, also acquired Cripple Creek and Victor in 2015 and delivered a profitable expansion at the mine within a years\u2019 time.\n\nThe company boasts the largest gold reserves and resources as well, with 90% of reserves located in the Americas and Australia, according to Monday\u2019s press release.\n\nThese assets, coupled with Newmont\u2019s cutting-edge and sustainable electric gold mining technology, have allowed the company to sustain production of six to seven million ounces of gold over a decades-long timespan.\n\nGold remains one of the world\u2019s most precious and coveted metals, with its rarity helping to maintain its value. Australia, South Africa, and Russia lead the world in terms of the largest estimated gold reserve, with about 3,260 metric tons of gold being produced worldwide last year.
