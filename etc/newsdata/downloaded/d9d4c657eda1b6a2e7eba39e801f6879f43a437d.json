Did you notice?\n\nScaramucci, a short former Trump staffer with a short White House stint, is promising a long campaign to dump Trump. He\u2019s making the media rounds at home \u2013 and worse \u2013 abroad, to call the President of the United States \u201chorrific and despicable,\u201d a \u201cnarcissist,\" an \u201corange maniac\u201d and \u201csedated.\u201d\n\nHe called Trump\u2019s G-7 performance \u201can unmitigated disaster.\" He supports using the 25th Amendment to remove Trump and said he\u2019s \u201ctotally incapable of handling\u201d the job, that Trump supporters need to be deprogrammed and the GOP is a \u201cpersonality cult party.\u201d\n\nAnd he wasn\u2019t done. Scaramucci called the president a \u201cfascist\u201d and a \u201cracist\u201d who\u2019s having a \u201cfull-fledged mental breakdown. It is literally like Joe McCarthy and Roy Cohen got together and had a baby, and the baby was Donald J. Trump.\u201d\n\nOh yes \u2013 and he said he\u2019s not bitter.\n\nScaramucci is starting to remind me of the hunchback, Ephialtes of Trachis, in the movie \u201c300\u201d who betrayed Sparta and joined the Persian Army after King Leonidas rejected him.\n\nIn a surreal version of the true story, Ephialtes followed the 300 Spartans over treacherous terrain from a distance as they marched to fight the Persian Army at a narrow pass at Thermopylae, nicknamed the \u201cHot Gates.\u201d\n\nWhen Ephialtes caught up with the Army, he kneeled and made his pitch to the king. He begged the king to let him join the fight against the formidable Persian Army. He even demonstrated the Spartan sword thrust that his father taught him. Leonidas was impressed.\n\n\u201cRaise your shield,\u201d the king commanded.\n\n\u201cSire?\u201d\n\n\u201cRaise your shield \u2013 as high as you can.\u201d\n\nThe hunchback struggled but couldn\u2019t lift his shield.\n\n\u201cYour father should have told you how a phalanx works,\u201d the king said. \u201cWe fight as a single, impenetrable unit; that is the source of our strength. \u2026 A single weak spot, and the phalanx shatters. \u2026 I am sorry, my friend. But not all of us were made to be soldiers.\u201d\n\nSadness overwhelmed Ephialtes. Then anger. Then rage and revenge. Then he snapped.\n\nHe was so blinded by his personal animosity that he betrayed all of Sparta to the Persian Army. Ephialtes\u2019 betrayal at the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. is how his name came to mean \u201cnightmare\u201d in Greek.\n\nScaramucci has become Ephialtes. He\u2019s snapped, and it\u2019s hard to watch.\n\nGovernment officials parting ways with the president\u2019s team is nothing new. They publicly express gratitude for having the privilege to serve and keep a low key, understanding that they served at the pleasure of the president. We\u2019ve seen nothing like Scaramucci. It\u2019s like Rachel Maddow and Lawrence O\u2019Donnell got together and had a baby, and that baby was Anthony Scaramucci.\n\nWhy such venom?\n\nScaramucci said his \u201cred line\u201d was when Trump sent a \u201cracist and unacceptable\u201d tweet telling the four congresswomen (the Squad) to go back to their countries if they don\u2019t like ours. He told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that the comments were reprehensible and his Italian grandparents would be \u201cwickedly upset\u201d with him if he didn\u2019t speak out. So, he upset Trump instead.\n\nFirst of all, the tweet was not racist; it was patriotic. Trump\u2019s sentiment was no different than telling Barbara Streisand, or some other celebrity, to go live in Canada or someplace else when they threaten to leave if a conservative they hate gets elected. Before Trump sent the tweet, I must\u2019ve yelled at the television 50 times for \u201cThe Squad\u201d to go live somewhere else if they hate the country so much. As usual, Trump said what many of us were already thinking.\n\nSo, Scaramucci attacked him. Trump, who was falsely accused of being a white supremacist, fascist and racist every day for three years now, counterpunched. The \u201cMooch\u201d has been barreling down the road to political oblivion ever since.\n\nHis reckless vendetta has nothing to do with principled politics, or with saving the country from a \u201cdiseased dad,\u201d as he puts it. It\u2019s about Scaramucci not being able to \u201craise his shield\u201d high enough to cover his bruised ego. No matter how hard he soaks his language in the fragrance of principled politics, his overreaction to Trump\u2019s tweet stinks to high heaven.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame, too, because Scaramucci\u2019s no dummy. He graduated from Tuft University with a Bachelor\u2019s in economics. He earned a J.D. from Harvard Law School. He founded a successful global alternative investment firm, wrote four books, and is estimated to have a net worth of $200 million.\n\nBut none of that success kept him from going on some of the most vicious, Trump-hating networks to say the most vicious, Trump-hating things.\n\nWhat makes Scaramucci\u2019s revenge so egregious and petty is, like the Battle of Thermopylae, it comes at a time when America is in a consequential ideological war where \u2013 to win \u2013 the source of our strength is to fight as a \u201csingle impenetrable unit\u201d against formidable forces. Civil War is not coming to America; it\u2019s already here. And we\u2019ve lost whole institutions to the enemy forces already.\n\nSo Scaramucci, let it go. We elected Trump. We know he\u2019s \u201ccrazy\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s why we hired him. He was the axe behind the glass that we broke because the country was in an emergency. It still is. The man has such sharp elbows because, well \u00ad\u2013 he\u2019s an axe! In the insane times we\u2019re living in, \u201cpresidential\u201d is not as important as getting America\u2019s dilapidated institutions repaired or replaced.\n\nThe \u201cpresidential\u201d and genteel types have, for decades, exposed the country\u2019s load-bearing walls to an infestation of political termites that made major institutions rotten to the core. For decades, the dignified ones just painted over things.\n\nHe\u2019s president, but more of a general contractor. Obama had a phone and pen. It didn\u2019t work. Trump has a hammer, a saw and a chisel to demolish the rotten structures, fix what\u2019s salvageable and build what\u2019s needed to keep the house from collapsing. It\u2019s working.\n\nFor us, Scaramucci, this was never about Trump; he just happened to say what we were saying. Trump\u2019s election was about pushing back against the irreconcilable differences we have with liberals, leftists and progressives over fundamental moral and political issues that could leave this country on the ash heap of history.\n\nIn a vast sea of whale-sized issues we\u2019re facing, your beef with Trump is just a shrimp. The longer you go with this \u201cthe guy is a fascist\u201d bit, the more likely you\u2019ll chisel yourself into history as an angry little man, embittered by the \u201cking\u2019s\u201d rejection \u2013 just like Ephialtes.", "description": "Anthony Scaramucci turned on Trump. \u00a0Did you notice? \u00a0Scaramucci, a .09/16/2019 19:06:39PM EST.", "authors": ["Will Alexander", "Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/299/9bea8410-5e08-4c9d-88ff-4b9615db4d64.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
