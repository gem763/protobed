I thought that if he had one ounce of decency in him, he could have shown it before he died by admitting and clarifying a number of issues that are outstanding.\u2019\n\nReflecting on Milat\u2019s death, he added: \u2018A lot of people are going to be very satisfied with the current outcome and will be pleased that it\u2019s over.\u2019\n\nThe Northumberland-based father of Ms Clarke, Ian Clarke, said: \u2018No matter how Christian one might be, you can\u2019t help but be glad this has happened.\u2019\n\nGerman couple Anja Habschied and Gabor Neugebauer, were among the victims\n\nThe body of Deborah Everist was found in 1993 after going missing late in 1989 (Picture: AAPIMAGE)\n\nHe previously told the Sydney Morning Herald: \u2018If he was to finally face up to the fact and admit to any others that he has done, if indeed he has, then I think that would be a wonderful thing for those parents, because for the short time that we didn\u2019t know, I know just how they must be feeling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It was in its way a form of closure, that we\u2019d found her [Ms Clarke] and we were able to lay her to rest properly. It\u2019s these other parents who don\u2019t have the luxury of being able to do that.\u2019\n\nCriminologist and author Amanda Howard corresponded with Milat practically every month since 1997 and says he never would have made a deathbed confession.\n\nShe said: \u2018He died in a very painful way but he was happy that he was able to take these secrets to his grave.\u2019\n\nMilat was sentenced to prison in 1997 and had been in custody since 1994 (Picture: REX)\n\nMs Howard, who suspects he had more than seven victims, said Milat had recently written to her to say he \u2018felt for the parents of the German backpackers\u2019.\n\nHe wrote: \u2018I can\u2019t imagine what they must be feeling knowing that this and this and this had happened to their children.\u2019\n\nDespite this, Ms Howard says he went into graphic detail and \u2018enjoyed being able to relive that and retell that story.\u2019\n\nMilat was moved to maximum security solitary confinement after an escape attempt in 1997.\n\nHe continued to make headlines over the years through hunger strikes and self-harm and severed a finger with a serrated plastic knife.\n\nGerman Simone Schmidl was found dead in November 1993 (Picture: AAPIMAGE)\n\nAnja Habschied was unearthed by police along with boyfriend Gabor Neugebauer (Picture: AAPIMAGE)\n\nMilat underwent specialist palliative care at a Sydney hospital for more than tow weeks but was returned to prison on Tuesday last week to ensure he died behind bars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCorrections Minister Anthony Roberts said: He showed no remorse. We ensured the sentence was carried out. He can rot in hell.\u2019\n\nIn a recent television interview, Milat\u2019s older brother said: \u2018He was going to kill somebody from the age of 10.\n\n\u2018It was built into him. He had a different psyche. He\u2019s a psychopath and it just manifested itself with \u201cI can do anything, I can do anything.\u201d\u2018\n\nKaren Milat described her former husband as a \u2018gun nut\u2019 who shot and knifed kangaroos in the forest where his victims were found.\n\nThe father of Caroline Clarke said you \u2018can\u2019t help but be glad\u2019 about Milat\u2019s death (Picture: PA)\n\nJames Gibson, 19, from Melbourne, was found dead in October 1993 along with partner Deborah Everist (Picture: AAPIMAGE)\n\nShe said he had a cat called Gizmo, loved his Harley-Davidson motorcycle and painted model trucks and planes in camouflage colours as a hobby.\n\nMilat\u2019s crimes inspired the Wolf Creek horror movie and television series released since 2005.\n\nHis gruesome legacy continued in 2010 when his great-nephew Matthew Milat lured his 17-year-old friend into the Belanglo forest and murdered him with an axe.\n\nThe then 17-year-old murderer, who was sentenced to 43 years in prison, boasted to a friend the day after the killing.\n\nHe said: \u2018You know me, you know my family. You know the last name Milat. I did what they do.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
