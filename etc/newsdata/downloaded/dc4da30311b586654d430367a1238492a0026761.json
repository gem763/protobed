Just kidding. The actor Bob Keeshan, who played Captain Kangaroo, is telling Bunny Rabbit why kids should wear seat belts, circa 1970. (CBS/CBS)\n\nAt a news conference Tuesday morning, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) had this to say about the latest developments in the impeachment inquiry being led by House Democrats:\n\n\u201cWhat we see in this impeachment is a kangaroo court, and Chairman Schiff is acting like a malicious Captain Kangaroo.\u201d\n\nMatt Gaetz: \"What we see in this impeachment is a kangaroo court and Chairman Schiff is acting like a malicious Captain Kangaroo.\" pic.twitter.com/QQPaj8sR0p \u2014 The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) October 8, 2019\n\nSo.\n\nHere we are in 2019, where it has become necessary to explain that the classic children\u2019s television show \u201cCaptain Kangaroo\u201d was not a courtroom drama. This may be news to Gaetz, since the last episode of the show, which ran from 1955 to 1984, aired when the congressman was about 2 years old.\n\n\n\nThe size of Captain Kangaroo's pockets shrank over the years, but they were always oversize, resembling a marsupial pouch. (CBS/CBS)\n\nBob Keeshan, the actor who played Captain Kangaroo, was not a captain, a kangaroo or even Australian. Originally from Queens, N.Y., he served in the Marine Corps during World War II, though he never saw combat. (Long-standing rumors that he and Lee Marvin were heroes at the Battle of Iwo Jima are not true.)\n\nBefore inventing and portraying Captain Kangaroo \u2014 so named because of his large pockets \u2014 he played Clarabell the Clown on another kids\u2019 program, \u201cThe Howdy Doody Show.\u201d\n\nSo \u201ckangaroo courts\u201d don\u2019t come from a kids\u2019 show. But if you thought the term \u2014 meaning an informal or improper court with no legal standing \u2014 comes from Australia, you would also be mistaken.\n\nThere are many theories about the American origins of the term, none of which have been definitively proved. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, it first appeared in print in the 1853 novel \u201cA Stray Yankee in Texas,\u201d in a description of a farcical court assembled by drinking buddies to \u201cprosecute\u201d one of their friends for kissing a black woman.\n\nBut it may date even earlier than that, back to the 1849 California Gold Rush. In 1985, the nationally syndicated column \u201cThe Straight Dope\u201d explained that \u201csome say miners established kangaroo courts to deal with claim jumpers (get it?).\u201d\n\nThose miners may have had Australia on the brain, because more than 11,000 Australians, many of them former prisoners, migrated to San Francisco during the Gold Rush. They were generally regarded as uncouth troublemakers known for drunkenness, arson and hiring \u201clow women.\u201d As the San Francisco Chronicle explained, one denizen of the \u201cSydney-Town\u201d slum was famous for eating literally anything you put in front of him \u2014 for the right price (a nickel!).\n\nIt got so bad that residents formed a vigilante group that lynched two Australians, deported 14 more and intimidated others into fleeing.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the Merriam-Webster Dictionary tweeted that \u201ckangaroo court\u201d was its top trending search. It had also found an even earlier first reference for the term, dating to 1841 and describing a lynching of \u201cloafers ... instituted by the kangaroo court.\u201d\n\nCaptain Kangaroo, who taught kids to be safe, follow the law and respect playmates, probably would not have approved.\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nRead more Retropolis:\n\nMail that baby: A brief history of kids sent through the U.S. Postal Service\n\n\u2018Some sad and scary things\u2019: Mister Rogers consoled kids by telling them the truth\n\n\u2018Real-life drama\u2019: When a senator won an Emmy for grilling witnesses at a televised hearing\n\nD-Day, for the historically challenged", "description": "Here we are in 2019, where it has become necessary to explain to Rep.
