Beaten, tortured, and humiliated by white supremacists. Forced to watch his own girlfriend\u2019s murder, with her little boy\u2019s life threatened next. All because the man he once respected as a mentor\u2014and protected, believed in, and killed for\u2014handed him over to die. The Jesse Pinkman we meet near the start of El Camino is not well.\n\nMinutes have passed since Jesse ripped out of a neo-Nazi compound in a black and red El Camino, howling. Walter White is dead. The Breaking Bad finale allowed him an exit on his own terms, in a final blaze of cunning\u2014that oscillating machine gun\u2014with the satisfaction of knowing, in some way, he\u2019d won: he\u2019d killed all his enemies. Devised a way to sneak his money to his family against their wishes. He\u2019d held onto the power and control he valued above all. And he\u2019d played the hero to Jesse one last time, freeing him from the compound to a new life on the run.\n\nBreaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan\u2019s meditative neo-western El Camino attaches a coda to Jesse\u2019s story, detailing the emotional (and physical) scars Walt left him to live with. Through shootouts, explosions, and slow-burn sequences of expertly-orchestrated tension, it follows Jesse\u2019s escape from the chaos of Albuquerque to a remote corner of Alaska. Its quieter moments, meanwhile, devote themselves to a survivor\u2019s slow, steady climb back to personhood, and to the grit and compassion that sort of journey entails.\n\nJesse\u2019s state of mind in the present is contextualized with periodic glimpses into his past, to moments spent with former lovers, enemies, and friends\u2014including Walter.\n\nIn their first scene together in six years, Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston slip back into a long-gone dynamic: miserable, cancer-ridden chemistry teacher and his drug-dealing former student. They\u2019re in a diner. Jesse piles pineapple chunks onto his plate like a guy who thought he\u2019d never taste food again. (The flashback follows the Season 2 classic \u201c4 Days Out,\u201d in which Jesse and Walt become stranded in the desert.) Walt glowers and lectures, chiding him to recommit to his education once these obligatory meth-cooking days are done and money for his family is secure.\n\nIt\u2019s a snapshot of days when, in Jesse\u2019s eyes, \u201cMr. White\u201d seemed incapable of poisoning a child, letting Jane die, or leaving him to be enslaved. Red flags of narcissism go unnoticed or dismissed. (Jesse learns Walt thinks he never graduated high school, despite being onstage when he received his diploma!) But before the scene ends, Jesse senses something strange about Walter. \u201cYou\u2019re really lucky, you know,\u201d Walt tells him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to wait your whole life to do something special.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s talking about cooking meth\u2014not something Jesse can think of as a lifetime\u2019s achievement. It\u2019s a telling moment in a scene full of them, each darkened by what we know happens next. (Just see how Jesse dotes on Walter, reminding him to eat, reassuring him that his family will be taken care of, and patting him as he coughs, which only embarrasses Walt.) As Paul himself says, \u201cIt was pretty heartbreaking.\u201d\n\nThe Emmy-winner (times three over for his work on Breaking Bad) spoke to The Daily Beast on the eve of El Camino\u2019s release on Netflix, as boyishly hyped about it as Jesse sometimes gets about magnets. Between praise for Gilligan\u2019s \u201clove letter\u201d to his character\u2014and for Cranston, whom he counts among his \u201cbest friends\u201d\u2014Paul spoke to how the film changes Jesse and the character\u2019s legacy, what it was like to share a scene with Cranston again, and more spoilers from the film. Read our conversation below.\n\nI saw the movie yesterday\u2014\n\nAnd? What did you think?!\n\nWell, Jesse was always my favorite character, so it was especially satisfying for me.\n\nUgh, I love you! That\u2019s awesome.\n\nI read that you re-watched just one Breaking Bad episode before shooting El Camino. Which was it?\n\nIt was a [Season 5] episode called \u201cBuyout,\u201d and it was just to remind me of where Jesse was mentally when he decides that he\u2019s going to leave the business, leave Walt, leave Mike, leave everyone behind and make his escape. It was just to get me mentally prepared for where he was at in that scene with Mike by the riverbed, at the very opening of the whole thing. But yeah that was it, other than that I kind of knew where he was at. And I loved how Vince painted this picture for everybody. I thought it was beautifully told.\n\nYou get to share a scene opposite Bryan Cranston again, in character as Walt and Jesse. Can you tell me about that day on set and what feelings it stirred up?\n\nYou know, it was very odd. It was so much fun. Just being around Cranston in a work environment again is such a dream come true. He\u2019s so incredibly immature, that man. And also so professional. But he\u2019s just a class clown, he\u2019s just a goofball. And he\u2019s the best. He\u2019s the best. He\u2019s one of my best friends and my mentor so it was nice to zip on these skins, these characters that completely changed our lives forever. You know, I talk to him every day. I really do. So it was really special for both of us, and for the whole crew. Every background player in that diner scene was either a crew member or the family of a crew member, so it was so nice to be surrounded by loved ones in such a secretive scene that\u2019s a part of such a secretive movie. The fact that we kept it under wraps, even long after we shot it, was such an accomplishment.\n\nThat scene is such a fascinating snapshot of a specific time in Jesse and Walt\u2019s relationship. Walt is still just a defeated, miserable chemistry teacher trying to leave money behind for his family, and Jesse is really still just a kid, far removed from who he is in the present day.\n\nI know! He\u2019s sort of this sweet, little innocent kid before all the darkness just sort of took over him. As the actor that has played him for so long, and knew him so well, it was so nice to be reminded of the happier times in his life, like when he was in love with Jane, before that relationship turned into kind of a chemical romance, in a way.\n\nWhy do you feel that Jesse remembers that moment in the diner with Walt right then?\n\nThey just had survived something pretty major. That scene landed toward probably what would have been the tail end of the episode \u201cFour Days Out\u201d where they\u2019re in the middle of the desert and they almost die because Jesse left the keys in the ignition [of the RV] and drained the battery. And he\u2019s just so happy to be alive. Then he remembers something that Walt said toward the end of the conversation: \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to wait your whole life to do something special.\u201d It just hit him in such a major way like, my god, we\u2019re just cooking crystal meth here. Not all that special. So yeah, it was pretty heartbreaking.\n\n\u201c He gave them a way out and then his hand was forced. And Vince got his true Western shootout, which was so great. \u201d\n\nSkinny Pete tells Jesse early in the movie, \u201cDude, you\u2019re my hero and shit.\u201d And the more we watch, the more we do see Jesse as an honorable, heroic outlaw. The movie reiterates how much he values human life, what he\u2019s done to keep other people safe. And then we see him make a stand, like a white hat in an old Western. Do you feel like he goes from victim to hero?\n\nYeah, it actually all ties into the advice he got from Jane at the very end of the movie, like, you have to create your own destiny. You can\u2019t just go where the world takes you. No, you have to take control of that yourself. And Jesse finally does that, from the very beginning, he escapes and sheds this skin a little bit\u2014you know, he shaves this ratty hair, he shaves that dirty beard, and he\u2019s like moving forward. And I love that. He\u2019s no longer going to be the victim. And he gave those guys at Kandy Welding the opportunity [to live.] He wasn\u2019t trying to rob them of all their money. He said, look, this is just a favor. Just 1800 dollars, that\u2019s all I need. That\u2019s it. He gave them a way out and then his hand was forced. And Vince got his true Western shootout, which was so great.\n\nHow do you feel like the movie changes how we see Jesse?\n\nI think it just kind of paints a more detailed picture of what I believe most of the audience wanted for him. You know, so many people would stop me, still, really, on a day-to-day basis. \u201cWhat happened to Jesse? Where\u2019s Jesse?\u201d And now it\u2019s like, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to find out what happens to Jesse. I hope he survives, I hope he\u2019s okay.\u201d And I think this just sort of paints that picture of what is probably gonna be a rocky road ahead of him, but he\u2019s making the appropriate steps to finally find his freedom.\n\nIs there one thing in particular that felt the most special to revisit about the character?\n\nI mean, to be honest, just to be able to be inside of that skin and give Jesse this ending that I didn\u2019t realize that I wanted. I thought Breaking Bad ended so perfectly and I loved that it was sort of ambiguous, like, \u201cOh wait. I think he\u2019s OK. I\u2019m not sure exactly what happened, but I\u2019m OK with not knowing and I\u2019m OK with sort of creating my own version of that story.\u201d But to be able to be in that skin and be directed by our creator, who is just such a beautiful man, such an incredible talent, but also the most humble person in Hollywood, who just never takes credit for himself\u2014which he should really learn to start to do because he deserves it. But just revisiting with old family and friends from the show. It was just such a beautiful time in my life, Breaking Bad was so life-changing for everyone involved. To be able to play around in that universe yet again and be directed by that creator is obviously just such a dream come true.\n\nWas there any initial trepidation on your part about potentially over-explaining Jesse\u2019s story, or whether it would have been better left in viewers\u2019 imaginations?\n\nYeah, honestly, zero. I had zero hesitation. Just because I know Vince as a storyteller. I know he is the last person on the planet who wants to mess with the legacy that is Breaking Bad. That is his baby. You should have seen him anytime he was trying to wrap up a season. He was just such a stress case, because he wanted it to be perfect. Years later, he had this idea that he couldn\u2019t shake. He doesn\u2019t have to tell this story; he just felt that there is a story here. And I want to create that and give that to people. I think if you liked the show, then you trusted in Vince, and if you trusted in Vince, that trust shouldn\u2019t stop after Breaking Bad. He\u2019s a beautiful storyteller and always has been. So I\u2019m so excited that people who are watching it have been pretty pleased. It\u2019s been pretty unanimous. Everyone\u2019s been pretty excited about what Vince did with this story and the legacy of Breaking Bad and Jesse Pinkman.\n\nHe approached it with such care, you know? When he told me, he said, \u201cLook, I just wanted to gauge your interest first. I feel like I have this story arc. Now that you\u2019re onboard, let me just write this script and I\u2019ll get back to you, but I do want to be honest with you about something: if and when I finish this script, and it\u2019s not perfect, I don't want to do it.\u201d You know, and that was it. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to get excited or disappointed, I just want you to be aware of the reality. I don\u2019t want to do it unless there\u2019s a reason to do it.\u201d And I think he did just that.\n\nYou know people are now going to stop you on the street and ask what happened to Jesse in Alaska.\n\n(Laughs) I know, I know.", "description": "The \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d Netflix movie is here.
