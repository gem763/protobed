The mix-and-match line is unisex and was formulated and manufactured in Switzerland.\n\n\"We know that customers love skincare, especially buying it online,\" says Secola. \"We wanted to create something no-fuss and simple to navigate.\"\n\nBazaar tried a few of the products at the launch and was particularly impressed with the Vitamin Booster Serum (\u00a320), which feels more like a primer (so might be one to look out for if you don\u2019t get along with oilier serums) and contains both a derivative of vitamin C and vitamin E. Meanwhile, the Fresh Complexion Face Peel (\u00a312) is a simple, gentle physical exfoliant for those averse to acids.\n\nSkincare buffs might still prefer something a little more techy \u2013 no retinols here \u2013 but the range has cottoned on to the fact that people like to wash their face in different ways, offering five different types of cleanser - with every product, naturally, qualifying for next day delivery.\n\nSHOP NOW\n\nLike this article?
