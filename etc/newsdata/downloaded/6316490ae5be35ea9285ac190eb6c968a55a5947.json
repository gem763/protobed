For 2020, it now sees growth of 1.0% for 2020, down from its earlier estimate of 1.6%. For 2021, the institute predicts an expansion of 1.4%.\n\n\u201cThe real problem with (U.S. President) Donald Trump\u2019s trade disputes is not the tariffs themselves, but the great uncertainty about what is to come. Uncertainty is poison for investment decisions,\u201d IfW President Gabriel Felbermayr said.\n\nHe noted, however, that many emerging countries around the world still had a lot of economic catching up to do.\n\n\u201cThis offers very great export opportunities for German mechanical engineers and car manufacturers,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is therefore no reason to question the export orientation of the German economy.\u201d\n\nThe RWI economic institute also reduced its growth forecast for the German economy for this year to 0.4% from 0.8% previously. For 2020, it sees 0.9% growth, saying there were increasing signs that the economy was going into a downturn.\n\n\u201cIn particular, the decline in production continues in the manufacturing sector, especially in the automotive industry,\u201d it said. \u201cThis increases the risk that the German economy will fall into recession.\u201d\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel told lawmakers earlier that the current economic situation in Germany meant tax revenues may come in lower than expected. This could limit the government\u2019s fiscal room to counter a recession.\n\nHowever, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told lawmakers on Tuesday that Germany was ready to pump \u201cmany, many billions of euros\u201d into its economy to counter any significant slowdown in growth and the country must take bold measures to fight climate change before it\u2019s too late.", "description": "The German economy will slide into a recession in the current quarter, the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW) said on Wednesday as it slashed its growth forecasts for Europe's biggest economy due to trade disputes and Brexit uncertainty.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
