When we use the most powerful measurement tools we have, to zoom in as close as we possibly can in hopes of seeing what\u2019s holding it all together, it still looks like a blank canvas. But, mathematically, this simply doesn\u2019t make sense. Something must be missing.\n\nSome physicists believe that we\u2019d find quantum foam \u2013 an infinite expanse of subatomic spacetime bubbles \u2013 if we could dial our cosmic microscopes in close enough.\n\nFrom a dozen or so feet up in the air, a trail of marching ants looks like a crooked black line. Get a little closer and you might notice that the \u201cline\u201d is in constant motion. Zoom in a bit more and you can see the individual ants marching along. Move even closer and you\u2019ll see the insects\u2019 segmented bodies, six legs, antennae, mandible, and other features. The closer you get, the more complex the object becomes. Scientists believe our view of the universe works in a similar way.\n\nQuantum mechanics seeks to provide a unified theory to explain why the universe is expanding, how gravity works, and what\u2019s really going on beneath the hood. But most of it still remains theoretical due to the challenge of observing the \u2018hidden\u2019 features of the universe. When it comes to the quantum-scale world, it\u2019s like we\u2019re watching an army of ants march along a forest floor from the window of an airplane in flight.\n\nPhysicists tend to agree that the universe is expanding, and that its expansion has accelerated since the Big Bang. These facts turn some long standing theories on their ear. Researchers have posited everything from theories involving elastic \u2018strings\u2018 that stretch as the universe expands to wacky hypothesis that invoke multiple universes, but at the core of most unified theories is the idea that some sort of invisible or hidden dark matter and dark energy must exist.\n\nAs it turns out, the multiverse theories might be more grounded in reality than some of the more serious ones.\n\nThe quantum foam theory has been around since 1955 when physicist John Wheeler came up with it, but it\u2019s seeing a resurgence in 2019. Modern researchers sense we may be closing in on the technology we\u2019ll need to actually observe and measure dark energy (or whatever the universe is made of).\n\nThe spacetime foam explanation for dark energy basically says that the space in between conventional matter is occupied by bubbles that work like dark matter. They keep the classical matter and energy in the universe from becoming ubiquitous \u2013 at least theoretically.\n\nWhat\u2019s astonishing is that, according to the research, these bubbles have their own continuum. They\u2019re self-contained universes. Time doesn\u2019t have to work the same way inside these bubbles because, for the purposes of this theory and due to a concept called entropy, the \u2018arrow of time\u2018 isn\u2019t necessary to explain the quantum world.\n\nIf you were a subatomic piece of dark matter caught in a spacetime foam bubble, you might experience time backwards, sideways, or not at all. Dark energy would have to work apart from our classical model of thermodynamics, while simultaneously accepting the parts of it we consider immutable. Spacetime foam, theoretically, accomplishes this. It\u2019s a potential piece of evidence towards a \u2018grand theory of everything.\u2019\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t boggle your mind, consider this: if spacetime foam is real, and scientists can prove it exists, such knowledge would force us to consider that our own universe may be nothing more than a tiny bubble in someone else\u2019s universe that could pop at any moment.\n\nRead next: Nvidia\u2019s new Shield Android TV devices could launch October 28", "description": "", "authors": ["Tristan Greene"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fspacefoam-2.jpg&signature=762a0551f03ec3d16c3018b7d960a5fd", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
