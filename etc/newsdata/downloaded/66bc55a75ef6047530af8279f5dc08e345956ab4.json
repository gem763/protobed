For context, First Direct was the initial neobank in the UK \u2014 it launched in 1989 and was bought by HSBC in 1992. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nHSBC's move underscores the impact that the rise of UK neobanks is having on legacy banks. UK-based neobanks are projected to almost triple in customer count over the next year, but they still struggle with profitability. Neobanks like Monzo, Revolut, Starling, and N26 are expected to grow from 13 million customers to 35 million in 2020, according to research from Accenture.\n\nOn top of that, neobanks are seeing customer growth outside of London, in part due to rural areas being hit hard by branch closures at legacy UK banks. For its part, First Direct counts nearly 1.5 million customers, and though it doesn't report separate financials, it's been profitable for over two decades. In sharp contrast, neobanks across the board are struggling to achieve profitability.\n\nFirst Direct is responding to that threat by adding features that will open it up to a broader audience. First Direct CEO Joe Gordon said it will make a string of improvements, including the addition of new features that will make it \"more accessible to a wide population.\" Some of the planned features include an in-app marketplace and a \"financial autopilot,\" which would use AI to make personalized recommendations and automate activities like reloading savings accounts.\n\nAdditionally, the digital bank will allow customers with limited credit histories to open accounts while providing them with services to improve their credit. Offering services to consumers with poor or no credit has been a major selling point allowing neobanks to reach an underserved audience. Pairing that same strategy with new personalization features could position First Direct as a serious threat to its neobank competitors.\n\nHSBC will work extensively with fintechs to retool its neobank, an arrangement that can serve as an example to other legacy banks in the future. First Direct is working with several fintechs, including UK-based Bud, which HSBC invested in this year, along with Goldman Sachs. Similar partnerships are becoming more common: 81% of banking executives in a Finextra survey cited working with partners as the best strategy for achieving digital transformation, underscoring how legacy banks and startups are moving toward collaboration.\n\nAnd nearly half of financial services companies surveyed by Lloyds said they've completed deals to acquire fintechs or take a minority or majority stake in them. Many of these bank-fintech partnerships have yet to come to fully play out, but HSBC's strategy of leveraging its partnerships to revamp its digital arm is one example of how these partnerships and investments could develop.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
