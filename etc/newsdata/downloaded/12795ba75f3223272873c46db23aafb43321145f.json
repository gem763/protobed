The 10 ways Trump and his supporters are fighting back against impeachment", "language": "en", "text": "Republicans are privately said to be very worried.\n\nThe wayward, scattershot approach adopted by Donald Trump and the White House as the president is confronted by the threat of impeachment, does not appear to working.\n\nWhen Robert Mueller in May 2017 embarked on his investigation into Russia\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign, the president assembled a large team of high-profile DC lawyers to advise him about dealing with the special counsel.\n\nYet, as various Democratic-controlled committees in the House of Representatives push on with their probes, issuing subpoenaes and calling on officials to testify, Mr Trump appears to have taken on the role of his own defence lawyer, shouting down anyone who dares to question him. Matt Mackowiak, a Republican operative and CEO of the Potomac Strategy Group, said Republicans would \u201crather not have to go through this\u201d, though claimed the president may emerge stronger as his base was being energised.\n\n\u201cSo far, Republicans are sticking with him,\u201d he told The Independent. \u201cAt the moment there are no cracks.\u201d Privately, some Republicans appear less confident. \u201cWho knows what playbook they are on,\u201d one Republican legislator told The Hill. \u201c[Trump\u2019s] pulling it out of his ass as he goes along.\u201d\n\nThe ways Trump has tried to defend himself:\n\nIntimidation and threat\n\nIn what might be termed the Sicilian defence, the president has shouted and made lots of noise, seeking him to frame himself as the victim. He has used social media and appearances with foreign media to claim Democrats and their hidden helpers are seeking to carry out a \u201ccoup\u201d. He referred to the \u201ccivil war\u201d when tweeting about how supporters would feel if he were impeached. At the same time, he has sent out the likes of Mike Pompeo to attack Democrats on his behalf. Lawyers for the whistleblower expressed concern for their client\u2019s safety after the president said he wanted to see his accuser face-to-face. Mr Trump has hinted darkly at what should happen to the whistleblower and the people who gave him information, telling a private meeting of UN staff: \"You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart, right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\"\n\nHowever, this approach only takes the president so far. He may have got away with shouts and threats all his life, and for much of his political career, but there appears to some steel and determination about Nancy Pelosi and her colleagues, that was not there before the Ukraine scandal erupted. Control of the House gives Democrats huge power. An impeachment probe is not something that can be bought off, hushed up or settled out of court.\n\nDismiss accusations as second or third-hand\n\nThe president has repeatedly sought to discredit the whistleblower. As well as suggesting they are a \u201cspy\u201d, he tweeted: \u201cFake Whistleblower complaint is not holding up. It is mostly about the call to the Ukrainian President which, in the name of transparency, I immediately released to Congress & the public. The Whistleblower knew almost nothing, its 2ND HAND description of the call is a fraud.\u201d Whether the information raised by the whistleblower is first hand, is not important. What matters is whether it is credible, something the intelligence community inspector general Michael Atkinson, among others, said it was. Veteran GOP senator Chuck Grassley said the whistleblower had acted correctly, adding: \u201cNo one should be making judgments or pronouncements without hearing from the whistleblower first and carefully following up on the facts.\u201d\n\nClaim transcript shows that conversation with Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelensky was \u201cperfect\u201d\n\nThe president has repeatedly said his conversation with his Ukraine counterpart contained nothing nefarious. \u201cIt was a beautiful, warm, nice conversation.\u201d However, even the redacted partial memo released by the White House \u2013 not a transcript as the administration termed it \u2013 largely mirrors the whistleblower complaint. \u201cThe other thing, there\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,\u201d the memo reports the president as saying. \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it.\u201d", "description": "Republicans are privately said to be very worried.The wayward, scattershot approach adopted by Donald Trump and the White House as the president is confronted by the threat of impeachment, does not appear to working.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe", "Phil Thomas"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/igMM0Jpg3F0m41inpDE64g--~B/aD0zNzE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/ea812d35b55828d6c4f09db47a1e274d", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
