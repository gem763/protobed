Stand up, fight back! When immigrants are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back!\" and \"When children are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back!\"\n\nAt one point, one of the moderators of the event tried to get the protester to stop interrupting.\n\n\"Please, that\u2019s enough now. We hear you. This is a forum where we respect free speech, we respect the right to protest. But with respect to the audience who wants to hear this speaker, let\u2019s save the rest of it for the Q&A period,\" she said.\n\nAfter trying to speak multiple times, McAleenan eventually left the stage after it became clear the protesters would not stop chanting.\n\nThe Migration Policy Institute, who hosted the event, said in a statement it was regrettable McAleenan was unable to deliver his remarks.\n\n\"By drowning out the Secretary's remarks, the protesters deprived immigration attorneys, service providers, journalists, advocates, business leaders, law students, and many others in the public who were in the audience from hearing his point of view and engaging in a meaningful dialogue,\" the group said.\n\nAnd we're off!
