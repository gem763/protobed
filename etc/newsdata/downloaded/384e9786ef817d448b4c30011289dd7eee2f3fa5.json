At no time did EMA or Miami NHC indicate a 95% or even a 10% probability of the storm gong across the state, into the Gulf and hitting Alabama. Model tracking has indicated a northward turn for the last four days. Face it - Trump can't read a map and clearly spent time playing golf, tweeting and watching Fox and Friends instead of monitoring the storm's progress. The fact that he had never heard of a category 5 storm despite this being the fourth one since he took office is clear evidence of his failing memory and mental capacity.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
