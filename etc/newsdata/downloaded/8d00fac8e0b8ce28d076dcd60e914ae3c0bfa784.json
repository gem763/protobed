Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a US diplomat, reportedly hit him with her Volvo while driving on the wrong side of the road. August 28: Police speak with Sacoolas but she is granted diplomatic immunity August 28: September 16: Sacoolas leaves the country for the US October 4: Harry's parents call on President Trump to intervene and return Sacoolas to the UK October 9: Boris Johnson says he will speak to Trump to ask for Sacoolas's return and rescind diplomatic immunity October 9: Trump defends Sacoolas, saying it's difficult to drive on the correct side of the road in the UK October 12: Lawyers from both sides make contact for the first time\n\nMs Charles said before boarding her flight that she had received a letter from Mrs Sacoolas expressing her 'deepest sympathies and apologies'.\n\n'To be perfectly honest, yes, it's the start of some closure for our family,' she was quoted as saying by The Daily Telegraph.\n\n'Having said that, as it's nearly seven weeks now since we lost our boy, sorry just doesn't cut it'.\n\nEarlier, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) wrote to the family to say Mrs Sacoolas did not have diplomatic immunity.\n\nMr Seiger said the Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab's letter stated: 'The US have now informed us that they too consider that immunity is no longer pertinent.'\n\nThe letter, sent by Mr Raab to the family, said: 'We have pressed strongly for a waiver of immunity, so that justice can be done... Whilst the US government has steadfastly declined to give that waiver, that is not the end of the matter.\n\n'We have looked at this very carefully... the UK Government's position is that immunity, and therefore any question of waiver, is no longer relevant in Mrs Sacoolas' case, because she has returned home.'\n\nSacoolas (pictured) initially claimed diplomatic immunity to avoid potential prosecution over the case\n\nMr Raab added that the matter was now 'in the hands' of Northamptonshire Police and the CPS.\n\nAn FCO spokesman told the PA news agency that the office 'would not be commenting further on the content of the letter'.\n\nBefore the letter was sent by the FCO, the family's lawyer Mark Stephens told PA: 'There are approximately 20,000 official diplomats in this country - there's a definitive list of who is and who isn't.\n\n'We know definitively that this guy was not a diplomat and therefore was not entitled to diplomatic immunity. That has a number of consequences.\n\n'That means that the Americans have made a false claim. She would not have been entitled to claim diplomatic immunity.'\n\nMeanwhile, Mrs Sacoolas's legal representative Amy Jeffress, from the law firm Arnold and Porter, said: 'Anne is devastated by this tragic accident.\n\n'No loss compares to the death of a child and Anne extends her deepest sympathy to Harry Dunn's family.'\n\nOn Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said America was 'absolutely ruthless' in its safeguarding of Mrs Sacoolas following the decision to grant her diplomatic immunity.\n\nMr Johnson said although President Donald Trump was sympathetic towards Mr Dunn's family's views on the use of diplomatic immunity, the US was 'very reluctant' to allow its citizens to be tried abroad.\n\nSpeaking of taking their campaign to the US, Mr Dunn's family said in a statement that they 'continue to live in a nightmare' and have so far been unable to grieve after his death.\n\nA statement released on behalf of the family said: 'As if losing Harry was not enough, they now find themselves having to expend enormous time and energy, which they can ill afford, generating sufficient publicity to garner public support to persuade the US government to help achieve closure and return the driver Mrs Sacoolas to England to face the consequences of her actions.'\n\nMrs Charles said: 'The letter from the FCO was amazing, we felt like we finally had a breakthrough, we finally had confirmed that the immunity that we didn't think she had has been confirmed, that she doesn't have it, certainly since she absconded back to the USA.\n\nMrs Charles (pictured) said: ''The letter from the FCO was amazing, we felt like we finally had a breakthrough, we finally had confirmed that the immunity that we didn't think she had has been confirmed, that she doesn't have it'\n\n'A statement from her lawyer is promising that we may be able to hopefully get a meeting put together \u2013 whether it's face to face or lawyer to lawyer, not really sure on that basis yet but fingers crossed we're stepping in the right direction.'\n\nMrs Sacoolas's lawyers said she was 'devastated' and has expressed a desire to meet with the teenager's family, who have arrived in New York in their quest for justice.\n\nHarry's parents are planning to give a series of interviews with America's main TV networks to heap pressure on the US government to hand Mrs Sacoolas over.\n\nMrs Sacoolas's lawyers released a statement at the weekend describing the death of Harry (pictured) in August as a 'tragic accident\n\nThey will then travel to Washington DC to meet senior figures in the US government to express their outrage at the handling of the case.\n\nTheir lawyer Radd Seiger told the Mail: 'Harry's parents want to look the US President in the eye and ask him to resolve this painful situation. He needs to understand they are utterly heartbroken.\n\n'We will not rest until we have Mrs Sacoolas back in the UK. That's the only way they can get closure.'\n\nMr Seiger said Mrs Sacoolas, 42, has been asked four times if she would be willing to return to the UK, and on each occasion she failed to respond to the question.\n\nHe added: 'Harry's family just want a direct answer as to whether she will to back to the UK and continue to help the police with their investigation.\n\n'We've asked the same question four separate times and on each occasion this question is ignored. That's unacceptable.'\n\nMrs Charles, Harry's mother, said that Mrs Sacoolas's response to the crash 'just doesn't cut it'.\n\n'My opinion on Anne Sacoolas now wanting to come forward and say sorry... is not really quite enough,' she told Sky News.\n\n'But I'm still really open to meeting her, as are the rest of us. I can't promise what I would or wouldn't say, but I certainly wouldn't be aggressive.' Harry's parents are reluctant to meet the mother of three unless she gives some sort of assurances that she is willing to be extradited to the UK.\n\nPolice have CCTV of Sacoolas driving on the wrong side of the road (pictured are new signs that have appeared outside the RAF base) but she claimed diplomatic immunity, meaning detectives could not launch a criminal investigation\n\nBut the matter may now be taken out of her hands if the Crown Prosecution Service applies to the US to extradite her. As the wife of a US intelligence officer, Mrs Sacoolas initially claimed diplomatic immunity and fled the UK after the crash just outside the military base.\n\nHarry suffered horrific injuries in the crash and died later in hospital.\n\nMrs Sacoolas had pulled out of the base, a US spy hub, on the wrong side of the road and collided with the teenager's motorbike on the brow of a hill.\n\nNew road markings and a sign have appeared outside the base. Arrows indicating the direction of travel have been painted on each side of the road and a yellow 'Please Drive on Left' sign has also been placed on the roadside.\n\nHome Secretary Priti Patel yesterday played down suggestions that Mrs Sacoolas could be extradited from the US.\n\nAsked on BBC1's The Andrew Marr Show whether this could happen, she said: 'It very much seems that the lady in question wants to start co-operating with the discussions and the investigations and I think that we should support that.\n\n'We need to ensure that justice is done but obviously that co-operation with this investigation takes place. That is absolutely right.'", "description": "Harry's parents Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn insist they will only meet the woman suspected of causing their son's death, US citizen Anne Sacoolas, if she promises to return to Britain.", "authors": ["Amie Gordon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/11/19686468-0-image-a-5_1571048092347.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
