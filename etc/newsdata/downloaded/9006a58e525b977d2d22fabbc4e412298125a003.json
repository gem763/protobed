That honor went to a rant about China and his trade war.\n\nCritics on Twitter also called out Trump\u2019s now-canceled plan to meet with Taliban leaders close to the anniversary of 9/11, and recalled his history of making insensitive and untruthful statements about the attacks.\n\n\u201cExcept when we invited the Taliban over for a photo op,\u201d tweeted attorney George Conway, the husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway and a frequent Trump critic.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks, Trump falsely boasted that one of his buildings had become the tallest in downtown Manhattan following the collapse of the World Trade Center. He\u2019s also made baseless claims that \u201cthousands\u201d of Muslims in New Jersey celebrated the attacks and said falsely that he \u201cspent a lot of time\u201d with first responders at Ground Zero.\n\nExcept when we invite the Taliban over for a photo op. https://t.co/kZaD35ozd6 \u2014 George Conway (@gtconway3d) September 11, 2019\n\nExcept when you invite the #Taliban to Camp David three days before #911 anniversary. #Trump #911neverforget \u2014 Andy Ostroy (@AndyOstroy) September 11, 2019\n\nI guess you did forget \"a bit\" when you sought a photo op with the Taliban at Camp David last weekend. https://t.co/ozEY5BfVNL \u2014 Douglas Kass (@DougKass) September 11, 2019\n\nYou'd forget long enough to invite the Taliban over \u2014 Devin Nunes Cocaine Cow (@EmmReef) September 11, 2019\n\nShould have been your first tweet of the day, Pal! \u2014 Jim Martz (@Martzsy) September 11, 2019\n\nand we will never forget what you did and saidhttps://t.co/hnImxsu4hh \u2014 dutch163 (@dutch163) September 11, 2019\n\nYou called the attack 7/11 on air. \u2014 Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) September 11, 2019\n\nnever forget that on 9/11, Donald Trump was bragging that he now had the tallest building in lower Manhattan \u2014 Jeff Tiedrich (@itsJeffTiedrich) September 11, 2019\n\nDid you forget when you invited the Taliban to Camp David on the week of 9/11?
