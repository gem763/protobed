This curious effusion warns that \u201cThe G.O.P. will not be able to postpone a reckoning on Donald Trump\u2019s presidency for much longer.\u201d\n\nOh, dear. Are things as bad as that? Yes, yes, a thousand times yes. And you know that it is really serious because the cri de coeur not only appears in the leaky flagship of the legacy media (I won\u2019t name it if you don\u2019t mind) but also it appears under the solemn byline of \u201cThe Editorial Board.\u201d\n\nSilence, please! The important people are about to speak. Pay attention!\n\nThe sobbing editorial is called \u201cThe Crisis of the Republican Party,\u201d but it might have been better titled \u201cWhistling Past the Graveyard.\u201d\n\nI always wonder exactly who is the intended audience for such high-and-mighty imprecations. They appear to be addressed to \u201cthe GOP,\u201d to \u201cconservatives\u201d (those who still have a \u201cconscience,\u201d i.e., those who have mutated into progressives), to \u201cRepublicans.\u201d Here is your last chance, such columns seem to shout, we\u2019re warning you. You are tearing the republic apart (you know they\u2019re upset when they start talking about \u201cthe Republic\u201d: I think they\u2019re trying to remind you of Rome circa 44 B.C.).\n\n\u201cThe problem with politicians who abuse power isn\u2019t that they don\u2019t get results. It\u2019s that the results come at a high cost to the Republic [right you are, Cicero!]\u2014and to the reputations of those who lack the courage or wisdom to resist.\u201d O tempora, o mores. \u201cThe courage or wisdom to resist\u201d\u2014and who, exactly, would be the exemplars of those virtues?\n\nBut, really, such columns cannot seriously be intended for conservatives. Any real conservative would simply snort contemptuously should he encounter such out-of-touch hysteria. No, I suspect that such pieces are really meant to buck up the progressive troops, much as a besieged general on the brink of losing the war puts on a brave face and urges his men to fight on. \u201cRally round, boys. Forget that the Bad Orange Man is surfing on the best economy in decades, that unemployment is at historic lows, especially for the people we\u2019ve been exploiting for\u2014er, especially for our loyal minority constituency, that real wages are rising, that our military is stronger even as the country is extricating itself from costly foreign entanglements: forget all that, put it out of your mind. Remember that Donald Trump tweets mean things about people whom we like.\u201d\n\nNo column titled \u201cThe Crisis of the Republican Party\u201d can hope to achieve liftoff without the aid of the historic bad man Joseph McCarthy, senator from Wisconsin, scourge of Commies real and imagined, poster child for leftist vituperation. And sure enough, the authors of this desperate address wheel him out right at the beginning. Back in the McCarthy era, you see, Republicans had a \u201cconscience.\u201d Senator Margaret Chase Smith of Maine stood up to the baddie McCarthy and appealed to the \u201cbetter angels of her party\u201d (yes, they really make this allusion to Lincoln). Not that Senator Smith thought her protest would garner immediate results: \u201csometimes the point is just to get people to look up\u201d\u2014you know, up there to the morally elevated eyrie where members of this editorial board nest and cluck and brood.\n\nBut mention of Joe McCarthy is just a rhetorical throat-clearer. The gravamen of the admonition centers around the man they love to loathe, Donald Trump. In order to communicate the full, skin-crawling mendacity of this column, it is necessary to quote at some length. Exordium:\n\nThe Republican Party is again confronting a crisis of conscience, one that has been gathering force ever since Donald Trump captured the party\u2019s nomination in 2016. Afraid of his political influence, and delighted with his largely conservative agenda, party leaders have compromised again and again, swallowing their criticisms and tacitly if not openly endorsing presidential behavior they would have excoriated in a Democrat. Compromise by compromise, Donald Trump has hammered away at what Republicans once saw as foundational virtues: decency, honesty, responsibility. He has asked them to substitute loyalty to him for their patriotism itself.\n\nDecency, forsooth! Honesty! Responsibility! How \u201cdecent\u201d was it of this wretched newspaper to forgo even the appearance of impartiality in its reporting on Donald Trump, how \u201chonest,\u201d how \u201cresponsible\u201d?\n\nSuch handwringing oration is merely the runway for a long bill of particulars. I love it when the Editorial Board ticks off its indictments, because they never do it without flying far, far above the plain truth. The idea, I suspect, is to substitute assertion for fact in a rushed and very loud voice, hoping that velocity and volume will distract from the tendentiousness of your assertions. Hark:\n\nMr. Trump privately pressed Ukraine to serve his political interests by investigating a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, as well as by looking into a long-debunked conspiracy theory about Democratic National Committee emails that were stolen by the Russians. Mr. Trump publicly made a similar request of China. His chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, said publicly on Thursday that the administration threatened to withhold military aid from Ukraine if it did not help \u201cfind\u201d the D.N.C. servers. These attempts to enlist foreign interference in American electoral democracy are an assault not only on our system of government but also on the integrity of the Republican Party. Republicans need to emulate the moral clarity of Margaret Chase Smith and recognize that they have a particular responsibility to condemn the president\u2019s behavior and to reject his tactics.\n\nThese paragraphs are worthy of a Mary McCarthy Prize. McCarthy once said that everything Stalinist screenwriter Lillian Hellman wrote was a lie, including \u201cand\u201d and \u201cthe.\u201d So it is here.\n\nThe president did not \u201cprivately\u201d press Ukraine about anything. He acted in his capacity as president of the United States to ask the Ukrainian president to help investigate Ukraine\u2019s role in the effort, undertaken by assets in the U.S. intelligence community and the Clinton campaign, to destroy first candidate Trump and then President Trump. It\u2019s not \u201cconspiracy theory,\u201d let alone a \u201clong-debunked\u201d one, it is a fact. The focus was, and is, on interference in the 2016 election, the concerted effort by deep-state actors to intervene in the peaceful transfer of power and scuttle the election of someone duly elected in a free open and democratic election.\n\nNor did Donald Trump do anything wrong in bringing up Joe Biden and his corrupt son, as anyone who looks into the case has to acknowledge. Talk of \u201cattempts to enlist foreign interference in American electoral democracy\u201d are rich when the Clinton campaign enlisted interference from the Brits, an Australian, a shadowy Maltese professor, and the Ukraine. Great Alinksy! Talk about accusing your opponents of wrongdoing that you are committing yourself.\n\nTo appreciate just how far aloft from planet earth the Editorial Board has drifted, ponder this anxious prayer:\n\nYet Republicans will not be able to postpone a reckoning with Trumpism for much longer [Oh, really?]. The investigation by House Democrats appears likely to result in a vote for impeachment [Does it?], despite efforts by the White House to obstruct the inquiry [What efforts?]. That will force Senate Republicans to choose. Will they commit themselves and their party wholly to Mr. Trump, embracing even his most anti-democratic actions, or will they take the first step toward separating themselves from him and restoring confidence in the rule of law?\n\nGee, I wonder. Will the Republican-controlled Senate support an extraordinarily successful president or give in to the ravening maenads in the House who have not been able to reconcile themselves to Donald Trump\u2019s election. Talk about tough questions.\n\nYou can always tell when the Editorial Board thinks it is being really serious. It\u2019s then that they wheel out the semi-colons.\n\nThus far in office, Mr. Trump has acted against the national interest by maintaining his financial interests in his company and using the presidential podium to promote it; obstructed legitimate investigations into his conduct by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, and Congress; attacked the free press; given encouragement to white nationalists; established a de facto religious test for immigrants; undermined foreign alliances and emboldened American rivals; demanded personal loyalty from subordinates sworn to do their duty to the Constitution; and sent his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, around the world to conduct what could most charitably be described as shadow foreign policy with Mr. Trump\u2019s personal benefit as its lodestar.\n\nIn fact, being president has been awfully expensive for Donald Trump. He has lost upwards of $1 billion in net worth since taking office. As even Robert Mueller explicitly acknowledged, Trump did nothing to obstruct the preposterous Mueller investigation, an inquiry the president rightly denominated a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d that was hatched by the Obama White House and nurtured and abetted by people in the FBI, the CIA, the State Department, and Clintonland.\n\nTrump hasn\u2019t \u201cattacked the free press,\u201d he has merely fought back when attacked, a novel response from conservatives that has infuriated the Left, which loves attacking its opponents but is always surprised when they respond in kind. Trump did not establish a \u201cde facto religious test for immigrants.\u201d On the contrary, he has endeavored to make it more difficult for terrorists to enter the United States. Trump has not \u201cundermined\u201d foreign alliances, he has strengthened them. Ask Vladimir Putin, or Kim Jong-un, or the Iranian mullahs, or President Xi if Donald Trump\u2019s policies have \u201cemboldened\u201d them. I am not even sure what the comment about Rudy Giuliani is supposed to mean. Probably, it\u2019s what an amusing man once called \u201cthru text,\u201d words of a certain emotional or political valence that communicate a feeling but no facts, no argument.\n\nThere\u2019s more that could be said about this bit of nervous rhetorical play acting. But the bottom line is this: Although the column is called \u201cThe Crisis of the Republican Party,\u201d the real crisis is the utter politicization of the increasingly distraught legacy media. The election of Donald Trump challenged their cozy understanding of the world, turning it upside down.\n\nAdding insult to the injury of that existential assault is the fact that Donald Trump has been wildly, spectacularly successful. He has made America more prosperous, more secure, less harried by bureaucrats, and freer in their ability to practice their religion. What we are witnessing with such gems of hysterical mendacity are the pathetic death throes of a discredited political franchise and its rapidly disintegrating narrative.\n\nSoon, very soon, the reports of Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz and the U.S. Attorney John Durham will be published. Attorney General William Barr will make good on his promise to get to the bottom of the biggest political scandal in our history. Then we\u2019ll see the indictments and prosecutions and, probably, a spate of convictions.\n\nThe Editorial Board will howl. But it will be the impotent howl of one who has been exposed and humiliated.
