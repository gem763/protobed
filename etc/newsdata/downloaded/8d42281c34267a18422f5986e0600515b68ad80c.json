They want accountability, and they want it to be not only corporate but also personal, including members of the Sackler family that controlled Purdue and got fantastically wealthy from sales of its signature opioid painkiller, OxyContin. Purdue\u2019s proposal, which includes no new admission of wrongdoing, and which could be funded in large part from the proceeds of spinning off a Purdue international subsidiary, as well as future OxyContin sales, does not necessarily deliver that.\n\nNor does it deliver the retrospective transparency \u2014 full disclosure of Purdue\u2019s internal practices and procedures \u2014 that many of the plaintiffs demand. OxyContin is, after all, the product whose aggressive and \u2014 as the company admitted in a 2007 plea bargain \u2014 sometimes illegal marketing has been plausibly blamed for igniting the epidemic. The United States, and other countries, will be better equipped to prevent a similar disaster in the future if we know, in detail, all the causes of this one.\n\nAnd so while attorneys general for 24 states and five U.S. territories have accepted the Purdue proposal, we sympathize with the equivalent number of attorneys general, including Karl A. Racine of the District, Brian E. Frosh (D) of Maryland and Mark R. Herring (D) of Virginia, who have so far refused it. Certainly we can understand why they would not want to settle before understanding the full nature and purpose of the $1 billion that members of the Sackler family shuffled among trusts and overseas bank accounts, via wire transfer, in recent years. New York state documented the transactions after issuing a subpoena for company records; a spokesman for the family has called them \u201cperfectly legal.\u201d\n\nThere is a risk for these states, as the lawyers for Purdue and the Sacklers undoubtedly contemplated in structuring their settlement offer as they did. Once a judge approves the company\u2019s bankruptcy petition, all unsettled lawsuits are frozen, and the plaintiffs in those cases go to the back of the line for a share of the company\u2019s resources \u2014 while those who do agree to settle get paid first. The holdouts may, in the end, win no verdict, and receive no payment. But the search for justice may justify that risk.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: We\u2019re finally getting some accountability for the opioid crisis \u2014 long after victims are dead\n\nMaura Healey: Why I and other attorneys general are saying no to Purdue Pharma\u2019s settlement\n\nCharles Lane: Here\u2019s one billionaire who really might be a policy failure\n\nJillian Sackler: Stop blaming my late husband, Arthur Sackler, for the opioid crisis\n\nRobert Gebelhoff: The opioid crisis is too big for justice to stop with the Sackler family", "description": "Amid lawsuits, the opioid-maker declares bankruptcy.", "authors": ["Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TRKUOFWYXII6TP5RQSMIONUUOY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
