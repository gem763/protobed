Samsung says it offers \u201cthe optimum solution for slim full-display devices,\u201d suggesting it\u2019s intended for selfie cameras; the company currently offers a 32-megapixel 0.8\u03bcm sensor that\u2019s often used that way.\n\n\u201cThe optimum solution for slim full-display devices\u201d\n\nIf you know anything about camera sensors, you\u2019ll know that small pixel size is traditionally considered a bad thing, because each photosite has less light gathering ability and runs a higher risk of introducing noise. These new high-resolution phone sensors, however, work a little differently. In low light situations they combine four pixels together, which in this case should produce a 10.9-megapixel image with the light sensitivity of 1.4\u03bcm pixels \u2014 still not huge, but reasonably large by smartphone standards.\n\nIn practice, of course, resolution and pixel size aren\u2019t the most important factors when it comes to overall smartphone photo quality. Some of the best phone cameras around use regular 12-megapixel sensors. But I\u2019ve found that for mid-range devices, these small-pixel sensors can deliver a lot of detail in good light without the excess noise you\u2019d expect in low light. (Stay tuned for some 64-megapixel sensor testing soon.)\n\nSamsung says it expects the ISOCELL Slim GH1 to go into mass production by the end of this year, so we\u2019ll likely see it make its way into phones in early 2020.", "description": "Samsung has announced a new image sensor for smartphones that it claims has the \"smallest pixel size in the industry.\" The ISOCELL Slim GH1 is the world\u2019s first image sensor with 0.7\u03bcm pixels.", "authors": ["Sam Byford", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZIQnHWeQ0a6vnJEqWdfORji5L4s=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19085119/akrales_190819_3594_0456.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
