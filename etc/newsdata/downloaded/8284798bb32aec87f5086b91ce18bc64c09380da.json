(Picture: Modibodi)\n\nRemember doing that dreaded walk to the sidelines of the pool when you got your period during swimming lessons?\n\nIf you started menstruating at an early age then you might have felt embarrassed to be singled out, or you might have got FOMO from all the poolside fun going on.\n\nMenstruation may have also meant skipping a soak session at luxury infinity pools while on holiday. The point is, many menstruating people have had to miss out.\n\nSo Australian brand Modibodi, which specialises in period-proof underwear, has ventured onto swimwear.\n\nThe company has designed swimming costumes and bikini bottoms for teenagers so they never have to skip any water-based activities.\n\nDesigned to hold up to two tampons worth of blood, the teen swimsuit comes following the success of the adult ranges.\n\nCalled RED Swim, the range is also said to be smell and leak-free. The bottoms, which come in black and navy, are \u00a325 while the one-piece swimming costume is \u00a365.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat might be a bit pricey, but probably not as much as the accumulative price of sanitary products which often come in lots of plastic material.\n\nYou can get these bikini bottoms for \u00a325 (Picture: Modibodi)\n\nThe swimwear looks exactly like regular swimwear and the one-piece comes with a racerback design.\n\nThe designers behind the items say that RED Swim is so advanced, it\u2019s water-resistant and dries faster than others on the market.\n\nSo if you\u2019re self-conscious about dripping between the pool and the shower, then you don\u2019t need to stress.\n\nFounder and CEO Kristy Chong recognised that for young girls, staying active when navigating starting your period can be hard.\n\nSwimwear isn\u2019t the only thing getting a menstrual-friendly makeover. A student has also figured out how to make sexy lingerie that stays leak-free for 18 months.\n\nSian Hickey, from De Montfort University, debuted her line with four complete outfits at the university\u2019s Contour Fashion Show in London.\n\nAnd not a single pair Bridget Jones-style knickers in sight.\n\nMORE: Artist says using her period blood as a face mask leaves her skin glowing\n\nMORE: Thank you Always for acknowledging it isn\u2019t just women who bleed\n\nMORE: Sanitary product brand Always to remove feminine logo to be more inclusive to trans people\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Australian brand Modibodi which specialises in period-proof underwear has ventured onto swimwear.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_91479444_1571833070.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
