If they capture the entire town, the Turkish forces would control one of the two main roads that link the major Kurdish-controlled cities, making it harder for Kurdish forces to move troops and supplies.\n\nFootage broadcast on Turkish television showed members of a Syrian Arab militia, fighting under Turkish command, in the streets of the seemingly abandoned town. But Kurdish-led forces said they were still present in another part of Ras al-Ain.\n\nTurkish troops and their Arab allies were pushing to take a second strategic border town , Tel Abyad, 75 miles to the west.", "description": "It was the first significant breakthrough in the invasion of the Kurdish-held region, an incursion that entered its fourth day on Saturday.", "authors": ["Carlotta Gall", "Patrick Kingsley"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/12/world/12syria6/12syria6-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
