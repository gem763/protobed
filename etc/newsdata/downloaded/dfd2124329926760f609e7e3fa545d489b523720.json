The party is partnering with a Quebec-based carbon offset programme.\n\nThe Green Party says it does purchase carbon offsets and tries to limit campaign travel. Leader Elizabeth May crosses the country by train \"as much as possible\" and flies commercial only as needed, a spokeswoman said.\n\nWhat have the two parties promised on climate?\n\nClimate change has become a central issue in this federal election campaign, and in opinion surveys it frequently comes up a core issue for many voters who will be going to the polls on 21 October.\n\nThe Liberals have promised that they will exceed Canada's 2030 emissions goals - despite not currently being on track to meet the pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by that year.\n\nThey have also committed to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 - which would mean any emissions would be entirely offset by other actions - if re-elected.\n\nThe Conservatives have said they would immediately repeal the price on carbon Mr Trudeau's Liberal government imposed on four provinces, and instead focus on funding and exporting green technology innovation.", "description": "Mr Trudeau's team bought carbon offsets but the Conservatives say he's a \"high-carbon hypocrite\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13AEB/production/_109091608_21855141.jpg"}
