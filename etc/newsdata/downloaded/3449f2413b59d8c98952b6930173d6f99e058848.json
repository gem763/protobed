American screens", "language": "en", "text": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cJoker\u201d survived the intense controversy over its violent themes to take in $96.2 million in North American theaters at the weekend, setting a record for an October release, industry watcher Exhibitor Relations said Monday.\n\nStarring Joaquin Phoenix, \u201cJoker\u201d provides the backstory for the rise of Batman\u2019s maniacal nemesis, painting a dark and disturbing portrayal of a would-be stand-up comedian\u2019s descent into madness.\n\nAmid fears that it might inspire violence \u2014 a shooting at a 2012 screening of \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises\u201d in Aurora, Colorado claimed 12 lives \u2014 some theaters provided extra security for the opening of \u201cJoker.\u201d\n\nThe film, directed by Todd Phillips (maker of \u201cThe Hangover\u201d trilogy), has polarized critics. The Washington Post called it \u201cgrim, shallow (and) distractingly derivative,\u201d but Empire magazine deemed the Venice film festival prize-winner \u201cbold, devastating and utterly beautiful.\u201d\n\nUniversal\u2019s family-friendly \u201cAbominable\u201d placed a distant second at the box office, earning $11.9 million in its second weekend. It tells the story of a teen and her friends trying to help a young Yeti reunite with its family as a wealthy man seeks to capture it as a prize.\n\nIn third, at $8 million, was Focus Features\u2019 \u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d the cinematic follow-up to the hit TV series about an upper-class family and their stately home in a changing Britain. The movie has the Crawleys and their earnest staff scrambling to prepare for an unexpected visit by the British royals.\n\n\u201cHustlers\u201d from STX Films placed fourth, at $6.4 million. The Jennifer Lopez movie is based on a true story about strippers who plot to steal from their wealthy clients in recession-hit New York.\n\nAnd in fifth was horror film \u201cIT: Chapter Two,\u201d at $5.3 million. The Warner Bros. movie features the grown-up versions of the kids who battled the terrifying clown Pennywise 27 years earlier, as they are forced to do it again.\n\nRounding out the weekend\u2019s top 10 were:\n\n\u201cJudy\u201d ($4.6 million)\n\n\u201cAd Astra\u201d ($4.2 million)\n\n\u201cRambo: Last Blood\u201d ($3.6 million)\n\n\u201cWar\u201d ($1.6 million)\n\n\u201cGood Boys\u201d ($900,000)", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cJoker\u201d survived the intense controversy over its violent themes to take in $96.2 million in", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/8b7cd6_joaquin-phoenix-star-new-warner-bros-picture-joker-is-film-hollywood-premiere-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
