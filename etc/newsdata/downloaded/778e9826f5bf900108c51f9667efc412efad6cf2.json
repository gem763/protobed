After waiting 45 minutes for the locksmith, Martin, who had been an executive at Nokia and Apple, had an idea for a better lock, one that he could control with his phone. Martin called it a \"founders' moment\" in an interview with CNBC. Three years and $71 million in funding later, that lock is now available to buy from Level Home, a 50-person company Martin founded along with Ken Goto, who had also worked at Apple. Level Lock is a $250 deadbolt enabled with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.
