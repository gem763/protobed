WhatsApp is pretty good for keeping in touch with people, and you can use it to call your contacts, but if you don\u2019t have a stable internet connection, you\u2019re out of luck. Rebtel doesn\u2019t require internet to make calls \u2013 it uses local lines to make calls. This means an international call will only cost you as much as it would to make a local call. If the person you\u2019re calling also uses Rebtel, the call is actually free. Handy.\n\nThis is pretty much Google Maps, but Waze has a few extra features that Google Maps doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s updated all the time, and features the latest information on things like accidents near you, and how bad the traffic is. Other Waze users also contribute with their own tips, observations and advice.\n\nYour personal safety should always come first when it comes to travelling, and this app is very useful. It tells you how secure and safe any particular area is. In some cities, it\u2019ll even map the quickest way for you to get to the nearest police station.\n\nSome countries will prevent you from using certain apps. If you download a Virtual Private Network (VPN) app like Tunnel Bear, you can still keep in contact with your nearest and dearest on Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram. Having a VPN will hide your phone\u2019s IP address and location, and can help make your network more secure.\n\nEnter your destination and preferred mode of transport into Rideways, and you\u2019ll be given loads of travel routes and options to choose from. You don't want to have to rely on taxis; they're convenient, but they can be expensive. Besides, isn\u2019t it more fun to travel like a local when you\u2019re abroad?\n\nTake the fuss out of planning a holiday by downloading Google Trips. Simply input your preferences and destination and you'll get a list of tourist spots to check out, and advice on how to make the most out of one day. What\u2019s extra cool is that the app doesn\u2019t need internet data to work.\n\nNever forget anything, ever again. Plug in your travel destination, dates you\u2019re travelling, and any other relevant details, and the app will spit out a list covering everything you\u2019ll need to bring on your getaway.\n\nForget Expedia or Booking.com \u00ad\u2013 Dayuse.com is a hotel booking app that lets you check into hotels at super short notice. If you need a place to relax, freshen up or just to catch a few hours of sleep, this app will find you rooms \u2013 with discounts. Nice.\n\nThere's so much more to Airbnb than just finding a home away from home for a holiday. You can also use it to book special experiences with local guides. If you\u2019ve ever fancied learning how to cook French food from an actual French chef, you might be able to find someone offering just that here.\n\nBoth a language-teaching and handy translation app, iTranslate is a must for anyone on an adventure. Not only will it translate the words you type in, it\u2019ll slowly speak it it out loud for you, so you can try to communicate with others in their language. Plus, it\u2019ll save previous translation requests, which will save you from having to type in \u201cHow much does that cost?\u201d 20 times a day while you\u2019re away.\n\nAll gifs via GIPHY", "description": "Make sure you're fully prepared for any eventuality by downloading these apps before you leave Hong Kong's and its excellent internet coverage.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/shutterstock_531311446.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
