Photo: NurPhoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nA federal judge on Monday delivered good news to those holding out hope that the public will one day see Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns. In a 75-page ruling, Manhattan judge Victor Marrero slapped down Trump\u2019s argument that sitting presidents cannot be criminally investigated. That allows the Manhattan district attorney to move forward with a subpoena on eight years of Trump\u2019s tax returns. It won\u2019t happen immediately though. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued a temporary stay of the subpoena Monday morning.\n\nMonday\u2019s ruling comes more than a month after Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance subpoenaed Trump\u2019s accounting firm, Mazars USA, for Trump\u2019s corporate and personal tax returns going back to 2011. The subpoena is part of the investigation into the $130,000 in hush money paid to Stormy Daniels in the days before the 2016 general election.\n\nWhile Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, initially paid Daniels, who says she had an affair with the president, Cohen said the Trump Organization later reimbursed him. Trump still denies the affair.\n\nFederal prosecutors passed on prosecuting anyone beyond Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal campaign-finance violations, but Vance is still investigating whether Trump violated state law. The DA asked the judge to dismiss Trump\u2019s lawsuit, saying Trump was attempting \u201cto invent and enforce a new presidential \u2018tax return privilege,\u2019 on the theory that disclosing information in a tax return will necessarily reveal information that will somehow impede the functioning of a president.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s attempt to claim complete immunity from criminal investigation was novel, legal experts said last month when his lawyers put it forward. His team argued that the Constitution prevents the Manhattan DA, or any other state or local prosecutor, \u201cfrom criminally investigating, prosecuting, or indicting the President while he is in office.\u201d They said the Founding Fathers would have agreed:\n\n\u201cThe Framers of our Constitution understood that state and local prosecutors would be tempted to criminally investigate the President to advance their own careers and to advance their political agendas. And they likewise understood that having to defend against these actions would distract the President from his constitutional duties.\u201d\n\nIn Monday\u2019s decision, Marrero disagreed, calling the argument \u201crepugnant to the nation\u2019s governmental structure and constitutional values.\u201d", "description": "A federal judge Monday dismissed Trump\u2019s argument that he\u2019s immune from criminal investigation getting us one step closer to seeing Trump\u2019s tax returns.", "authors": ["Adam K.
