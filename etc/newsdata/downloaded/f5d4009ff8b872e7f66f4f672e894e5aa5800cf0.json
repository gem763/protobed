Nevertheless it should be noted the president\u2019s language and visage this week were especially wild. It\u2019s \u201ctreason,\u201d it\u2019s \u201ca coup,\u201d it\u2019s a \u201choax\u201d and a \u201cfraud,\u201d the whistleblower\u2019s information came from \u201ca leaker or a spy,\u201d it\u2019s a political \u201chack job,\u201d it\u2019s \u201cbulls\u2014.\u201d He had a Travis Bickell moment\u2014\u201cYou talkin\u2019 to me?\u201d\u2014with Jeffrey Mason of Reuters. He\u2019s careening around, growling and prowling like some preliterate King Lear. It\u2019s a reality show about a reality you don\u2019t want to be in.\n\nThe best description of him was low-key, from a former GOP congressional staffer: \u201cThe president is an unsettled person,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is assumed the House will impeach the president. If that is so, how is the great question. If it is a straight party-line vote, if it\u2019s shirts vs. skins, then the Democrats will have their victory in the House, quickly fail in the Senate, and not win in America.\n\nThis cannot be one party doing its one-party thing. I think Nancy Pelosi knows that.\n\nThe reason she did not put forward a formal resolution calling for an impeachment inquiry is said to be that she didn\u2019t want to jeopardize her moderate members from districts that voted for Mr. Trump. There\u2019s something in that, though a former member of Congress pointed out to me that most of the moderates aren\u2019t all that vulnerable\u2014they\u2019re way ahead in fundraising; Mr. Trump didn\u2019t win some of the districts by much; some don\u2019t have opponents yet.\n\nI suspect another reason Mrs. Pelosi didn\u2019t call a vote is that she knew the outcome would have been completely down-the-line partisan: Dems on this side, Reps on that. And that wouldn\u2019t look good. It would allow more than half the country to dismiss the effort as more party mischief.\n\nHere is a very open question: Can House Democrats control themselves? Can they look like they\u2019re not trying to kill their foe but trying to get the truth? I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s something about Democrats now that they seem embarrassed to reach out to Republicans, as if that\u2019s not done by nice people.\n\nCan they establish an air of earnestness and care, of fairness, of investigative depth?\n\nMembers of the investigating committees have to understand that in hearings they are not talking to the media, they are not talking to the Democratic base, and they are not talking to cable news. It\u2019s not about the hot exchange with a witness or a dramatic sound bite. You\u2019re talking to the American people. The impressions of fair-minded centrists and swing voters will be everything. And they will see right through your sound bites and Spartacus moments.\n\nYou won\u2019t impress them that way. They will turn on you if you give them only showbiz.\n\nMembers of the committees really have to prove they\u2019re operating in good faith. During the impeachment hearings for Richard Nixon you could honestly look at the Democrats and think: Most of them are trying to play it straight. It was still true of Republicans, though less so, in the Clinton impeachment.\n\nBut there\u2019s a good-faith deficit in Congress now as it becomes more brutal and partisan. It leads to losing sight of the big picture, which is what is good for America.\n\nFor instance, the Democrats want access to more transcripts of the president\u2019s phone calls with foreign leaders. That\u2019s a dangerous area. Foreign leaders need to have confidence they can speak frankly and privately with a president. In a world crisis lacking that confidence could prove disastrous. Normal people would understand this right away, and not approve of irresponsible fishing.\n\nMrs. Pelosi keeps saying she\u2019s moving forward more in sorrow than in anger and that she\u2019s praying for the president. Maybe she\u2019s overlarding it, but swing voters will see her calm in contrast to the president\u2019s lunacy, and prefer it. Her members should be watching her.\n\nShe is also trying to wire this thing without the help of committee chairmen of conspicuous stature. Here we get to Adam Schiff, chairman of the Intelligence Committee. He is an intelligent, focused and strikingly partisan figure. He will be a face, maybe the face, of the impeachment hearings.\n\nHe has already stepped in it with his tendentious paraphrasing of Mr. Trump\u2019s conversation with the president of Ukraine, a so-called parody that was bizarre, unserious, embarrassing. This was followed by reports he was misleading in denying prior knowledge of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\n\nMr. Schiff\u2019s weakness, at least in public, appears to be lack of judgment. You could see it last week in his questioning of the acting director of national intelligence.\n\nJoseph Maguire had been on the job in this high-turnover administration for all of six weeks. He\u2019s a serious looking guy, joined the Navy in 1974, was 33 years a Navy SEAL, rose to vice admiral. Speaking under oath he said, \u201cI am not partisan and I am not political.\u201d He\u2019s from a long line of those who\u2019ve served: \u201cWhen I took my uniform off in July of 2010, it was the first time in 70 years that an immediate member of my family was not wearing the cloth of the nation.\u201d\n\nThis guy is a citizen. He said he supports whistleblowing, that he got the whistleblower complaint a few weeks into his tenure, reviewed it, consulted with lawyers, tried to determine if the complaint was subject to executive privilege. The day before the hearing, the White House had released the transcript of the call, and he felt that allowed him to reveal the complaint, unredacted.\n\nHe said he believed the whistleblower and the inspector general did nothing wrong, did everything by the book. He believes this matter is \u201cunprecedented.\u201d Deeper in his testimony he said \u201cI believe the whistleblower is operating in good faith,\u201d and \u201cI think the whistleblower did the right thing.\u201d He expressed no skepticism at all.\n\nIt was pretty explosive!\n\nMr. Schiff didn\u2019t see it for what it was and rise to the moment. He proceeded to beat Mr. Maguire around the head, grilling him and interrupting answers. You went to the White House. You told the president\u2019s lawyers. Why didn\u2019t you come to me sooner? He fixated on \u201csequencing\u201d and \u201cchronology.\u201d\n\nHe seemed to miss the story totally and have no sense of how people at home would experience it. He was weirdly hostile.\n\nI was watching at home like an American and thought: What\u2019s wrong with you? The nation\u2019s top spy, who appears thoroughly upstanding, is expressing no skepticism about a complaint that alleges his boss, the president, is kind of a bum.\n\nHow could you miss that? You\u2019d have to be blinded. By what?\n\nDuring Watergate there was a guy called Peter Rodino of New Jersey, head of the House Judiciary Committee\u2014Democrat, Newark, pretty tough guy. He was no child, he was no na\u00eff, he was a party man. But he was judicious and capable and ran his committee well. After it voted to impeach Nixon, he got on the phone with his wife and wept. \u201cYou know, he was our president,\u201d he told Susan Stamberg of NPR in 1989.\n\nThat\u2019s what the Democrats need, someone who\u2019d be genuinely sad at taking out a president.", "description": "If it\u2019s a straight party-line vote, they\u2019ll win in the House, fail in the Senate, and lose in America.", "authors": ["Peggy Noonan", "Peggynoonanny", "Peggy.Noonan Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-FD326_Noonan_SOC_20191003194752.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
