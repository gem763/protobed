(AP)\n\nHOUSTON \u2014 Early Monday morning, when the World Series left Washington D.C. for Houston, the series\u2019 seven umpires boarded a charter flight to Iowa to bury their friend.\n\nEric Cooper had been a major league umpire for 24 years. They\u2019d worked the same season-long crews with him. One had worked this year\u2019s Minnesota-New York division series with him. They\u2019d shared long nights on hot fields in front of edgy crowds, the hard lifestyle between those games, and the meetings at home plate to begin the next one.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nCoop, as they called him, was 52. He\u2019d died nine days before. A blood clot, believed to be a complication from knee surgery a few days prior, had quieted the laugh, had silenced the frequent encouraging text messages, and had put them on a dawn flight to Des Moines.\n\nIn Iowa, they joined some 50 other active big-league umpires, along with retired umpires and other baseball officials, including several men who tend the umpires\u2019 rooms in ballparks. The fraternity is close.\n\nA day later, Lance Barksdale, who\u2019d worked the plate in Sunday night\u2019s World Series Game 5, stood outside the umpires\u2019 room at Minute Maid Park, his eyes red from grief. On their last night together, he\u2019d been at first base and Cooper at second base for Game 3 of the division series in Minneapolis. Cooper was in some pain, as his knee was aching, and he told Barksdale about the surgery, that he\u2019d have it early in the offseason so he\u2019d be ready for spring training and a 25th season.\n\nThey\u2019d had breakfast that morning with their wives. When it was done, Barksdale\u2019s wife, Jennifer, said, \u201cCoop, I love you.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cI love you, too.\u201d\n\nBarksdale was having lunch with his children in Oxford, Mississippi, when he learned Coop was gone.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cHe was a lovable person,\u201d Barksdale said. \u201cYou could feel like you had the worst game of your life and Coop would send you a text \u2014 \u2018I bet you shot a hundred tonight! You were great!\u2019 He\u2019d send those all the time, that positive reinforcement.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t get that text Sunday night, and the thought of it brought a smile to Barksdale, otherwise near tears.\n\n\u201cAnd everybody in America would say, \u2018Naw, Coop, you\u2019re wrong about that night!\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nThe World Series assignments arrived not long after he\u2019d last seen Cooper. Barksdale had been chosen for the crew. The text arrived a few minutes later.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d it said, \u201cmake sure your family gets those Metro cards in D.C. You don\u2019t have me to take care of you.\u201d\n\nCoop looked out for his own.\n\nThe umpires and their wives boarded a bus before dawn Monday. Major League Baseball had arranged for a charter flight. They were met in Des Moines by another bus, and in silence rode 25 minutes to the church. At the funeral, Joe Torre, MLB\u2019s chief baseball officer, spoke, as did veteran umpire Ted Barrett. In the audience were a handful of men who\u2019d umpired with Cooper through the minor leagues as well, among them Mike Everitt, Jim Reynolds and Jeff Nelson.\n\nThere were pictures of Cooper in the church, some on the major league fields he loved, others of a very young man in baseball and football uniforms.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to be an umpire,\u201d Randy Marsh, MLB\u2019s director of umpiring, said, \u201cfrom when he was very young.\u201d\n\nThe result was a job he loved, around men he loved and, at the end, a room filled with people who loved him back. Shortly after, the seven World Series umpires got back on a bus that took them back to an airport and an airplane that would deliver them to Houston. They arrived mid-evening Monday. By Tuesday night, Barksdale would have right field.\n\n\u201cIt puts the game in perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how long we\u2019ll live. Nothing is promised. To be in that church, to look around and see that fraternity, it was unbelievable. Makes you appreciate these times.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Early Monday morning, when the World Series left Washington D.C. for Houston, the series\u2019 seven umpires boarded a charter flight to Iowa to bury their friend.", "authors": ["Tim Brown"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/h_XJoydeJswrpaEUCp837Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04ODYuNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xr9iXXO0W4I7ai8mxgrTZA--~B/aD0yODQ1O3c9NDEwNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/950c4d30-faa5-11e9-bdda-db6f6e355fe0", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
