We just had another rough session as sentiment seems to be worsening in the runup to Thursday\u2019s meeting.\n\n\n\nIn fact, the losses on Tuesday were many times worse than yesterday.\n\n\n\nThe NASDAQ dropped 1.67% (or about 132 points) to 7823.78 and the S&P slipped 1.56% to 2893.06. The was off 1.19% (or around 314 points) to 26,164.04.\n\n\n\nThe major indices were in the red all day, but took a header late and closed right around the lows of the session.\n\n\n\nFor a brief moment there, it looked like the indices may actually turn positive on dovish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\n\n\n\nAt an appearance in Denver today, he stated that the Fed would expand its balance sheet soon and that there\u2019s \u201cno reason why the expansion can\u2019t continue\u201d.\n\n\n\nBut the good feeling didn\u2019t last long as the next headline was about the U.S. putting visa restrictions on some Chinese officials due to the detention of Muslims in the Xinjiang region. The algos really took the news and ran with it, sending the market on its final hour plunge.\n\n\n\nThis comes less than a day after the U.S. added several Chinese firms to its trade blacklist, which means those companies would be barred from buying American components without government approval.\n\n\n\nAnd this is all happening in a week when the U.S. and China are expected to meet in Washington D.C. for trade negotiations! So it\u2019s easy to see why investors are growing less optimistic that anything can get done.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve got one more day before the talks are scheduled to begin. What\u2019s the next headline going to be? Nobody knows, which is why the market is so skittish right now. Maybe this is one of those \u201cdarkest before the dawn\u201d scenarios for this trade conflict. Hope springs eternal!\n\n\n\nToday's Portfolio Highlights:\n\n\n\nSurprise Trader: With the next earnings season set to begin shortly, Dave thought this was a good time to \u201cclean out the closet\u201d. He sold the portfolio\u2019s remaining three positions, which included cashing in Zumiez (ZUMZ) for a 15.9% return in just a little over a month. The editor also sold Buckle (BKE) for a 7.6% profit in less than two months and Micron (NASDAQ: ) for a loss.\n\n\n\nZacks Short List: The portfolio swapped two positions in this week's adjustment and cashed in a double-digit winner. The stocks that were short-covered include Alteryx (AYX, +12.9%) and Inphi Corp. (IPHI). The new buys that replaced these names were Cheniere Energy (LNG) and QUALCOMM (QCOM).
