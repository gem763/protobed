He could easily get us into a war accidentally in Iran. He could easily get us into a conflict that is of consequence that he didn't even understand what he was doing. This is a really, really, really delicate time between now and next November.'\n\nThe 2020 frontrunner optimistically added: 'I do choose hope over fear. I do choose truth over lies. I do choose science over fiction.

We have more great research universities in this state and in this country than in all the rest of the world combined.\n\n'Why in the hell are we walking around [saying] \"Woe is me.
