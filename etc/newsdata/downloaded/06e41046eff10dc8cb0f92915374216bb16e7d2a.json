She will be the first parent sentenced in the scandal.\n\nHer legal team has asked for a year of probation in lieu of jail time, 250 hours of community service and a $20,000 fine.\n\nBut prosecutors wrote in a memo last week that \"neither probation nor home confinement (in a large home in the Hollywood Hills with an infinity pool) would constitute meaningful punishment or deter others from committing similar crimes\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Students react to cheating scam: \"This is how we got into an elite college\"\n\nHuffman worked with the scam's confessed mastermind, William Singer, to falsify a college entrance exam score for her oldest daughter, Sophia Macy.\n\nSinger arranged Sophia to take her SAT test in a special location. Sophia scored 400 points higher than her last score.\n\nIn a letter to Judge Indira Talwani, Huffman wrote: \"In my desperation to be a good mother I talked myself into believing that all I was doing was giving my daughter a fair shot.\"\n\n\"I see the irony in that statement now because what I have done is the opposite of fair. I have broken the law, deceived the educational community, betrayed my daughter and failed my family.\"\n\nHuffman said in her letter to the judge that her daughter had been unaware of the fraud, and was devastated to learn of it.\n\nThe actress wrote: \"When my daughter looked at me and asked me with tears streaming down her face, 'Why didn't you believe in me? Why didn't you think I could do it on my own?' I had no adequate answer for her.\n\n\"I could only say, 'I am sorry. I was frightened and I was stupid.' In my blind panic, I have done the exact thing that I was desperate to avoid.\n\n\"I have compromised my daughter's future, the wholeness of my family and my own integrity.\"\n\nProsecutors said Huffman made arrangements to have Singer cheat for her younger daughter as well before deciding against it.\n\nHuffman's husband - actor William H Macy - also had contact with Singer, though Mr Macy was spared charges.\n\nThough Huffman was among the most high-profile figures indicted, she paid among the smallest sums allegedly doled out by the parents charged in the scandal, according to court documents.\n\nLori Loughlin, another Hollywood actress ensnared in the scandal along with her husband, has pleaded not guilty to paying $500,000 in bribes to have their daughters accepted to the University of Southern California as members of the rowing team.\n\nMs Loughlin is next due in court on 2 October.", "description": "The actress, who pleaded guilty in May, is the first parent to be sentenced in the scheme.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07n7m5x.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
