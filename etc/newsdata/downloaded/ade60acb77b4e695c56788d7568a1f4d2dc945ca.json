If each of these businesses saved $5000 a year that would equate to $10 billion in savings.\n\n\"The banks are actually willing to negotiate because they know the client will take the next step and go to another bank and get a better offer.\"\n\nMr Cooper said he assesses his clients banks offer, frequently noting that banks are crimping on the reduced margin especially given the level of security the client has against the loan.\n\nThe weighted-average interest rate on current business variable-rate loans of $2 million or less fell to 5.45 per cent in the June quarter from 5.65 per cent in the June quarter of 2018, according to the latest Reserve Bank credit data.\n\nThe data also shows there has also been steady growth in credit to businesses with variable-rate loans of $2 million of less rising 1.8 per cent in the June quarter. The March quarter showed 1.2 per cent growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, credit to mining, manufacturing and construction as well as the wholesale and retail trade, transport and storage, which has all gone backwards in the June quarter.\n\nScared of lending\n\nBoth the Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe and federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg have been encouraging banks to lend to such businesses so they can invest and power the economy.\n\n\"It is important that our financial institutions support small businesses in particular,\" Dr Lowe said on Tuesday night.\n\n\"Lenders should not be so scared of making a loan that goes bad that they don\u2019t provide the credit that the economy needs.\"\n\n\"Lending standards have also been strengthened, although in some areas the pendulum may have swung a bit too far,\" Dr Lowe said.\n\nMr Cooper said loans from $1 million to $10 million were the ideal range to test banks on their competitiveness.\n\nHowever growth in the total credit outstanding for businesses with loans of $2 million was marginally down in the June quarter.\n\nOn Wednesday Treasurer Josh Frydenberg condemned the big four banks for not passing on in full the reduction in the official cash rate and urged people to \"shop around\".\n\n\"The banks have a lot of explaining to do. Customers should be voting with their feet,\" Mr Frydenberg said.", "description": "If each active business in Australia saved just $5000 a year from pushing their banks harder on cheaper interest rates it would equate to $10 billion savings.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3691%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_842%2C$y_162/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/724b041e08f5bacd1e82a9c69f65ed2f94984673", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
