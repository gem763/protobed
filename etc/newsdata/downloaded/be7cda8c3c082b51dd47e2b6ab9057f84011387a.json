Biden Jr. got a question about slavery and racism and gave an answer about Venezuela and record players.\n\nBut amid that exasperation, some students channeled their inner Beltway operatives and began a targeted rapid-response campaign.\n\nTyler Smith, 19, texted his grandmother after the debate, hopeful that Mr. Biden's meandering answer may have swayed her from supporting him.\n\nSign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter\n\nAmaya St. Romain, 19, mounted a three-day lobbying blitz on her mother and her great-grandmother, making sure they had seen the former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro\u2019s criticisms of Mr. Biden onstage.\n\nIn meme-speak, the efforts amounted to Killmonger, the villain in the Black Panther movie, challenging the people of Wakanda: \u201cIs this your king?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m definitely influencing them,\u201d Ms. St. Romain said of her family members. \u201cBut my dad is definitely still pro-Biden. And I don\u2019t really argue with him.\u201d\n\nIf Mr. Biden, 76, is going to win the Democratic nomination, it is likely to be because of the support of older black voters, a key constituency for the party and one that polls show is overwhelmingly supportive of the former vice president\u2019s candidacy.\n\nBut if he is to be overtaken by one of his more progressive rivals, the most powerful tool against him may not be opposition research or negative advertisements. Instead, it may be an organic effort by younger black voters \u2014 concerned about Mr. Biden\u2019s age and more moderate ideology \u2014 to sway their older family members.\n\nMr. Biden seems aware of this dynamic. In interviews, he has both acknowledged the generational gap among his black supporters and downplayed its importance, arguing that the support of older, more moderate black voters would be enough to give him an electoral advantage.\n\nStill, Mr. Biden, by his own admission, would be unwise to underestimate the lobbying efforts of those who are young and politically engaged. At a gathering of the New Hampshire Young Democrats in July, Mr. Biden said the same phenomenon \u2014 young people converting their skeptical parents \u2014 had helped fuel his own ascension in politics almost 47 years ago, when he was elected to the Senate as a fresh-faced 29-year-old.\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is, you have more influence on how your parents vote than they have on you,\u201d Mr. Biden said in July. \u201cYou may sit at the dining room table, having dinner with your mom and dad, and say, \u2018I met her and I really like her,\u2019 or \u2018I met him and I really like him.\u2019 And your parents will pretend it didn\u2019t matter much. But they\u2019ll go up, not a joke, they\u2019ll go up and say, \u2018If my kid liked that person that much, and knew them, there must be something there.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt Texas Southern University, a historically black university founded in 1927 and the site of last week\u2019s Democratic debate, dozens of students, ages 19 to 23, differed on their top candidate. Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Kamala Harris of California were among the favorites, as was one of the two Texans in the race, former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke.\n\n\u00a9 Ruth Fremson/The New York Times Last week\u2019s Democratic debate was held at Texas Southern University, a historically black university in Houston.\n\nFor Mr. Biden, though, students carried mixed feelings. They respected his tenure as Barack Obama\u2019s vice president, but implicitly rejected his campaign\u2019s central premise, that the primary goal of Democrats in the 2020 election should be defeating President Trump.\n\nThey pointed to systemic problems they said the country must address, such as inequality, climate change and gun violence. The Democratic nominee, they said, should embrace progressive proposals like canceling student loan debt, the Green New Deal and gun buyback programs.\n\n\u201cMe and my dad have the debate all the time,\u201d said Samantha Williams, 19, a sophomore. \u201cWe want a candidate that reflects us and what the world is going to look like when we run. But he says what we call \u2018woke\u2019 is really just sensitive.\u201d\n\nJaylan Jones, 20, said, \u201cOlder people have that conservative outlook on things,\u201d even older black Democrats.\n\n\u201cYoung people don\u2019t want Biden. We want Beto. We want Bernie,\u201d said Ms. Jones, a junior. \u201cI think we can convince them.\u201d\n\nThe difference in opinion across generations speaks to the changing politics of black communities, said Rashad Robinson, the president of Color of Change, the racial justice organization. And the historically diverse Democratic field has given voters plentiful options to choose from: multiple black candidates, white progressives who openly back once-radical ideas like reparations, and Mr. Biden, who served as vice president to the first black president.\n\nBlack voters are overwhelmingly members of the Democratic Party, and polls show they have long regarded Mr. Trump as a racist president and individual whom they are desperate to replace. A recent national poll of Democratic primary voters from NBC and The Wall Street Journal showed Mr. Biden had the support of nearly 50 percent with black respondents, though others have shown a less commanding lead.\n\n\u201cBlack people are strategic voters, particularly older black people,\u201d Mr. Robinson said. \u201cThey\u2019re thinking harm reduction. They\u2019re doing a deep analysis about what they think white people will accept and won\u2019t accept.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to the last Democratic primary, when younger black voters tracked more toward Mr. Sanders than their older counterparts, who overwhelmingly backed Hillary Clinton. In 2008, younger black voters supported Barack Obama in much bigger numbers than the electorate at large, until his victory in the Iowa Caucus led to a surge of support.\n\n\u201cYoung people are constantly signaling what\u2019s next and what\u2019s possible,\u201d Mr. Robinson said. \u201cAnd while there\u2019s some love for Biden, but sometimes you\u2019re in a relationship because you\u2019re comfortable and it\u2019s what you know.\u201d\n\nAnother Texas Southern student, Christopher Anwuri, 22, said the generational differences in how black voters saw the primary were fueled by opposing theories of political change: incrementalism versus immediate upheaval.\n\n\u201cThis generation is looking for an instant, quick fix for problems,\u201d he said. Older black people, meanwhile, think \u201cthese things need to take time.\u201d\n\nIt also comes back to Mr. Obama, and the long shadow he casts over national Democratic politics, particularly in black communities. Older black voters invoke his name in deference, and cite his embrace of Mr. Biden as something that helped him win the trust of skeptical white voters in 2008.\n\nTo younger generations, many of whom were in high school or younger at the time, Mr. Obama\u2019s achievements exist on their own. Their first memories of Mr. Biden stem from his highly meme-able vice-presidential years. They are also more likely to hold his long and at times controversial record \u2014 on criminal justice, school segregation and the Clarence Thomas hearings, among other things \u2014 against him.\n\nJayla Lee, 19, said older black voters \u201clike Biden because he was with Obama, and they feel like since they could trust Obama that means they can trust him.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the things we endure are not the things they endured,\u201d Ms. Lee said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m looking for someone who can change the things that affect me.\u201d\n\nSlideshow: Everyone who is officially running for president in 2020 (Business Insider)\n\nDarren Black, 22, said older generations were always \u201cgoing to ride\u201d for Mr. Biden, because \u201cJoe was there with Obama.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the younger generation, we've seen mass shootings, we\u2019re seeing more police brutality \u2014 we\u2019re looking at different things,\u201d Mr. Black said.\n\nYet contrary to their stereotype as idealistic and apathetic, and with the steely pessimism of seasoned political operatives, younger voters expressed a cleareyed understanding that their efforts to lobby their relatives would not necessarily be successful.\n\nAsked if she\u2019d had any luck converting her family to more progressive candidates, Ms. Williams, a political science major, said, \u201cI\u2019m making no progress. None. Not even a tiny bit. I wish.\u201d\n\nMs. Williams called her pro-Biden father a lost cause. \u201cWe\u2019re both opinionated and headstrong people, and I just don\u2019t have the energy to go back and forth,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Smith, a member of the school\u2019s College Democrats, said he liked Mr. Biden, but preferred his more left-wing rivals, such as Mr. O\u2019Rourke, Mr. Castro, Ms. Harris or Ms. Warren.\n\nAfter the debate, he thought about further pestering his grandmother over her support for Mr. Biden, but he reconsidered out of fear of coming off as pushy.\n\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s grandma, so you got to let her have it,\u201d Mr. Smith said.\n\nWhen reached by phone, however, Mr. Smith\u2019s grandmother, Alice Varnado, said his previous lobbying efforts had been more successful than he may have realized.\n\nMs. Varnado, 69, said she still preferred Mr. Biden, but that she had grown concerned about his age in recent months. She said she would vote for whichever Democrat earned the nomination, but she now considers Ms. Warren her second choice.\n\nHer family members \u2014 Mr. Smith and his uncle \u2014 had convinced her.\n\n\u201cYou know, since talking with my grandson and my son, I think I can go with her,\u201d said Ms. Varnado. \u201cI\u2019m starting to like her. There\u2019s been a turning point.\u201d\n\nKatie Glueck contributed reporting.", "description": "An organic effort by black millennials and Gen Z-ers to influence older family members against Mr. Biden may be important in the Democratic primary.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAHAaKO.img?h=169&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=800&y=396"}
