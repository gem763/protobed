The need is higher now.\n\nBDO view: We anticipate that more of these opportunities will be tested and offered over the next decade.\n\n\u2022 Reason: This type of revenue PPP is new to funders and developers (PPPs require long term commitment) and the term remains a sticking point (private sector wants 50 years plus, whilst government would prefer closer to 30 years).\n\nBDO view: Significant testing has been undertaken and parties have reached compromises on specific projects. With precedents in place, other projects should reach compromise more quickly.\n\n\u2022 Reason: Pressure is being applied by political interest groups to introduce or increase the affordable housing proportion within the residential offering. This is where government needs to strike a balance between its need to earn optimal revenues from its resources but also deliver to its social mandate. The resulting impact is unfortunately lower project returns.\n\nFurther analysis is required to determine the optimum balance of affordable to higher income housing in order to achieve returns that are still attractive to developers.\n\nHowever, it is also evident that interested developers would need to have strong social values to be good partners to government on these projects.\n\nIn future, increased flexing of government property resources for revenue purposes is likely to become the rule rather than the current occasional exception.\n\n\u2022 Christelle Grohmann is advisory director in the tourism specialist unit at BDO South Africa", "description": "Public Private Partnerships \u2013 an agreement between government and private sector where the latter finances, builds and operates a government service for a payment \u2013 have been active in South Africa for over 20 years.", "authors": ["Christelle Grohmann"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6986/c3ba29d5ba634070bef9d501b419f70e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
