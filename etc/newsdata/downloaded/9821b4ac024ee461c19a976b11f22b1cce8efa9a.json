Talks over a total payout of about $50bn stalled on Friday but lawyers said Monday\u2019s settlement may provide a path to an agreement.\n\nThe Ohio lawsuit was brought by two counties, Cuyahoga and Summit, using anti-racketeering laws, originally written to go after organised crime. The counties claimed that manufacturers of narcotic painkillers aggressively drove up sales with knowingly false claims that they were less addictive and more effective than they were, leading to a huge surge in prescribing and addiction.\n\nThe question is how much is enough? This is not enough. Armond Budish\n\nThey also alleged that distributors and pharmacies ignored legal obligations to restrict delivery and dispensing of the drugs, even as the death toll escalated, because they were making so much money.\n\nEileen Shapiro, the Summit county executive, said the lawsuit was intended to prevent drug companies flooding the area with opioids which \u201cdevastated\u201d communities and created a surge in illegal opioids led by heroin and fentanyl.\n\n\u201cWe started this originally to stop the behaviours,\u201d she said. \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d\n\nThe two counties were suing for a total of $7bn. Armond Budish, the Cuyahoga executive, said $260m would only go so far in dealing with the consequences of the epidemic.\n\n\u201cThe question is how much is enough? This is not enough,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he said it will provide some relief in offsetting the cost of treatment, the huge burden of overdoses on the emergency services and providing social care.\n\n\u201cHelping families deal with the results,\u201d he said. \u201cHelping kids basically left as orphans by this crisis.\u201d\n\nAmong the companies that agreed to payout on Monday were the distributors McKesson and AmerisourceBergen, both among the top 10 revenue-generating companies in the US. The Walgreens pharmacy chain did not settle. Its case will be joined with other pharmacies, including Walmart and CVS, at a separate trial.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the trial several opioid makers reached settlements, including Johnson & Johnson which lost a major trial in Oklahoma in August when a judge found the company\u2019s drive to sell opioids with false claims caused addiction and death.\n\nOpioid makers and distributors have paid out hundreds of millions of dollars to settle federal cases accusing them of failing to obey laws about cutting off opioid deliveries to pharmacies dispensing suspiciously large amounts of prescription painkillers. But the firms made no admission of liability.\n\nLawyers believe the industry is keen to avoid trials which will expose internal decision-making around the marketing, sale and delivery of opioids, and how much executives ignored evidence of rising addiction from prescription painkillers.\n\n\u201cWe now know from discovery in this case how this industry worked,\u201d said one of the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, Joe Rice.\n\nRice and other lawyers say they will not permit drug companies to use settlements to prevent evidence of their responsibility for the epidemic from being made public. They say the release of documents will be a condition of any comprehensive agreement.\n\nThey\u2019re getting away with murder. They\u2019re buying their way out. They think that\u2019s the way of doing business Emily Walden, Fed Up\n\nThat will be welcomed by activists who want to see the drug industry exposed.\n\nStory continues", "description": "* Teva and three drug distributors in last-minute settlement  * Firms were to be accused of profiting from addiction and deathTablets of opioid painkiller oxycodone.
