The 30-year bond yield rose 2.4 basis points to 2.066%.\n\nWhat's driving Treasurys?\n\nReports said China was open (link)to a limited trade resolution with the U.S., according to Bloomberg News on Wednesday, citing people with direct knowledge of tariff talks. A separate report from the Financial Times (paywall) indicated that China had offered to increase annual purchases of soy beans to 30 million tons, from the current 20 million tons.\n\nBolstered hopes for even a partial deal to the U.S.-China tariff spat boosted investor sentiment (link). Futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average point to a higher open for Wall Street, after logging a more than 1% percentage loss on Tuesday.\n\nSee: U.S.-China Trade Talks Keep Getting More Complicated. That's Not Good for Investors (link)\n\nThe Federal Reserve will garner some attention ahead of the release of the minutes from its September meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee at 2 p.m. Eastern. Last month, the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point, for the second time this year.\n\nKansas City Fed President Esther George and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell are set to speak later at 11 a.m. on Wednesday.\n\nAn auction of 10-year U.S. Treasury notes later in the afternoon could also influence trading for government paper as broker-dealers make room for the fresh wave of debt supply.\n\nWhat did market participants' say?\n\n\"Treasury prices are softer due to China's willingness to a partial trade deal with the U.S.,\" said Tom di Galoma, managing director of Treasurys trading at Seaport Global Securities.\n\nBut \"it is likely that the Trump administration could very well indicate they do not want a partial trade deal with China. If that happens, a \"risk-off\" trade will take place,\" said di Galoma.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 09, 2019 07:45 ET (11:45 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
