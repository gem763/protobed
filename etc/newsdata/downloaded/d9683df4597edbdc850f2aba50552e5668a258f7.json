Both packs cancelled each other out in Kumagaya, but the Pumas backs were too slick, especially centers Jeronimo de la Fuente and Juan Cruz Mallia, who was making his World Cup debut.\n\nOn a perfect stage - sunny, warm conditions in a stadium filled out with cheering, flag-waving kids from local schools - both teams seemed to agree the day was too good to waste and decided to entertain. There were few set-pieces and turnovers were simply resets to run the ball at each other over and over. It made for helter-skelter fun.\n\nArgentina showed its positive intent early by waiving two kickable penalties to go for tries. The first attempt was disallowed for a knock-on against the U.S. posts, and the second was cleared by the Americans.\n\nBut Mallia showed his threat in a counterattack from Argentina\u2019s 22, breaking up the middle only to see wing Santiago Carreras knock-on under presure.\n\nNo matter. The Americans\u2019 weakness in defense, away from the forwards, was exposed.\n\nMoments later, Mallia broke again through the middle and sent flyhalf Nicolas Sanchez sliding into the right corner.\n\nSanchez, the team\u2019s test points record-holder restored as a starter after a two-game demotion, repaid the effort with a chip to the U.S. tryline that bounced kindly for fullback Joaquin Tuculet, making his first appearance in the tournament.\n\nTuculet bagged a pair shrugging off a neck-high tackle out wide after the forwards couldn\u2019t pound the ball in.\n\nDown 19-0 closing on halftime, the Americans stayed upbeat and an AJ MacGinty grubber was scooped up by right wing and captain Blaine Scully to score.\n\nMacGinty\u2019s conversion attempt came off the post. The Eagles were contributing to the action but the backs were being outclassed.\n\nThe Pumas opened the second half with some amazing moves from right win Bautista Delguy. He had to run back to collect a dropped pass meters out from his line, ran behind the tryline then straightened up between the posts and was clear. He slipped a fourth tackle before running out of energy and kicking ahead to set up a lineout. From that, Mallia scored his first try, and a second try four minutes later from a quick lineout by de la Fuente.\n\nWhen Mallia gave left wing Santiago Carreras an overlap, and de la Fuente was inside him to score by the posts, the Americans appeared to be falling apart.\n\nBut they surprisingly countered with two of the last three tries, to center Paul Lasike and Scully again.\n\nIn between, replacement scrumhalf Gonzalo Bertranou, who arrived only this week after a tournament-ending injury to Tomas Cubelli last Saturday against England, dotted down from a break by the star of the match, Mallia.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Argentina reaffirmed itself as the top team in the Americas when it completed its Rugby World Cup campaign by beating the United States 47-17 on Wednesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Foster Niumata"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/09/japan_rugby_wcup_argentina_usa_78961_c0-183-3284-2097_s1770x1032.jpg?1e7a0d1994c6b08e2ba06b4af4253f5cbffaa17f", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
