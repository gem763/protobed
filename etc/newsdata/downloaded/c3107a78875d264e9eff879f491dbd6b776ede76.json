You get disoriented, you're tired, because it's a form of torture.\"\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption There was a huge investigation after Mohammed Dewji was kidnapped in October 2018\n\nHe said he could hear people looking for him.\n\n\"I kept hearing these chopper noises and thinking that maybe this chopper's looking for me.\"\n\nTen days after his abduction in October 2018, his company, MeTL, tweeted a quote from Mr Dewji saying that he had \"returned home safely\".\n\nHe has since thanked people for praying for his safety.\n\n'No ransom paid'\n\nMr Dewji told the BBC that his kidnappers had abandoned him in a field 15 minutes drive away from where he had been abducted at the Coliseum Hotel.\n\nThe authorities have not established a clear motive for the abduction and Mr Dewji is also in the dark about it.\n\n\"I still don't know why it happened,\" he said. \"Obviously the intention looked like it was money that they wanted. In the end they left me without the money.\"\n\nHe believes the kidnappers gave up due to pressure built up from media and political attention.\n\nA Tanzanian taxi driver, Mousa Twaleb, has been arrested and is awaiting trial. But he is the only suspect that is being held.\n\n'Need to give back'\n\nMr Dewji believes there were around three or four foreigners from Mozambique and South Africa involved, who he believes have fled the country.\n\nThe billionaire says he has made some changes in his life; replacing the lights in his house with brighter bulbs and has stopped jogging alone on the beach.\n\nHe said being kidnapped has made him reflect that \"you need to give back\".\n\nMr Dewji is credited with turning his family business from a wholesale and retail enterprise into a pan-African conglomerate. MeTL has interests in textile manufacturing, flour milling, beverages and edible oils in at least six African countries.\n\nForbes magazine estimated his net worth at around $1.5bn (\u00a3980m), which would make him Africa's youngest billionaire.\n\nHe intends to invest almost $400m in agriculture in Tanzania in the next 24 months, not for profit but to make an \"impact\", he said.", "description": "Tanzanian businessman Mohammed Dewji talks about last year's abduction for the first time.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/121E3/production/_103811247_tanz.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
