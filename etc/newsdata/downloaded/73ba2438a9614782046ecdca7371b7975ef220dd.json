Unable to write a thing. Menacing gods. I feel outcast on a cold star, unable to feel anything but an awful helpless numbness.\"\n\nAnother said: \"Look at that ugly dead mask here and do not forget it. It is a chalk mask with dead dry poison behind it, like the death angel. It is what I was this fall, and what I never want to be again. The pouting disconsolate mouth, the flat, bored, numb, expressionless eyes: symptoms of the foul decay within.\"\n\nPlath was born in Boston in 1932, the daughter of a strict German father. Her writing talents were quickly noticed, and she was published in national outlets and picked up awards and commissions. She also overcame a mental breakdown to graduate from Smith College with honours.\n\nShe was married with two children when she died at the age of 30 after taking her own life. In 1982, she won a posthumous Pulitzer Price for The Collected Poems.\n\nThe Google Doodle\u2019s creator, Sophie Diao, said: \u201cI find her work very empowering, and I really admire how hardworking she was. Writing almost every day, while being a homemaker and mother, and organising her and her husband\u2019s finances, and applying for grants and fellowships\u2026 she was clearly a strong-willed enthusiast.\u201d\n\nTo create the illustration, she said she first ordered all of Plath\u2019s poetry anthologies and read through them.\n\n\u201cI tried to find specific passages from her work that would thread together into a pseudo-narrative, but ended up pivoting to an illustration that would capture the mood of her work instead.\n\n\u201cI hope people are inspired to read some of Plath\u2019s work and learn a bit more about her.\u201d", "description": "Acclaimed American writer Sylvia Plath would have been 87 on Sunday, and the date is being marked by Google with a stunning Doodle aimed at capturing the mood of her work.
