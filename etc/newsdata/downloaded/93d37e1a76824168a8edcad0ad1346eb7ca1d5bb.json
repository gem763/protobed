And that order does instruct the secretaries of State and Health and Human Services to:\n\ndevelop and implement a process to determine whether the State and locality both consent, in writing, to the resettlement of refugees within the State and locality, before refugees are resettled within that State and locality under the Program.\n\nThe order is essentially a reinterpretation of the clause in the 1980 Refugee Act requiring that federal authorities \u201cconsult regularly with State and local governments and private nonprofit voluntary agencies concerning the sponsorship process and the intended distribution of refugees among the States and localities.\u201d The reason for such consultation is that the states and localities will have to bear the heavy cost of providing services for refugees who, unlike other immigrants, are eligible for welfare on the same basis as citizens from the moment they arrive. (The feds long ago welshed on the promise to reimburse states.) But the consultation has become meaningless, and refugees have been resettled wherever the feds and the advocacy groups they contract with want, whether the states and localities like it or not. Tennessee, for instance, formally withdrew from the federal refugee resettlement program, after which the number of refugees resettled there increased by more than 60 percent. A federal contractor took over the resettlement program in the state and was able to raise the number of refugees resettled in Tennessee even while overall numbers at the national level fell.\n\nThat\u2019s why I described the new executive order as giving states and localities a \u201cveto\u201d over resettling refugees in their jurisdictions. Wrongly, as it turns out.\n\nBecause further down there\u2019s an escape hatch which allows the federal government to override a state or local decision to refuse resettlement:\n\nIf the Secretary of State intends to provide for the resettlement of refugees in a State or locality that has not provided consent, then the Secretary shall notify the President of such decision, along with the reasons for the decision, before proceeding.\n\nSo it\u2019s true that during this administration refugees will only be resettled in places that consent, as the president said. But a future Democratic administration wouldn\u2019t even have to revoke or modify Trump\u2019s executive order to begin sending refugees to places that don\u2019t want them, so long as Secretary of State O\u2019Rourke or Castro email the White House a line or two about why they did it.\n\nThis point may seem banal; after all, the other changes to the refugee program \u2014 the lower ceiling for the current fiscal year, and the reduction in the UN\u2019s role in selecting who will come to the U.S. \u2014 can also be undone by a future administration, as can any other executive action (unless our lawless judiciary obstructs it, which a future Democratic president doesn\u2019t have to worry about). The difference here is that there\u2019s a lawsuit in progress that could bring about a much more enduring change, and taking the president at his word about having solved the problem could lead to the lawsuit being abandoned prematurely.\n\nThe state of Tennessee, represented by the Thomas More Law Center, sued in federal court in 2017 to challenge the federal government\u2019s authority to resettle refugees in unwilling jurisdictions. (For background, see here.) The state\u2019s claim is that resettling refugees in a state that is unwilling (with all the attendant costs) is comparable to Obamacare\u2019s mandate that states expand Medicaid, which was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2012.\n\nTennessee\u2019s case was dismissed at the district and circuit level, and last Wednesday the Sixth Circuit denied the petition for rehearing en banc. The merits of the case were never considered; the court dismissed the case on standing, as if the Tennessee legislature has no right to argue with the appropriation of state funds to pay for a federal program. This tees up a petition to the Supreme Court to hear the case. But the president\u2019s rhetoric that the issue has already been resolved could cause Tennessee to forego an appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nNot only would a favorable Supreme Court ruling prevent a future administration from resettling refugees in unwilling jurisdictions, but it would make it difficult to dramatically ramp up resettlement numbers. A future Democratic administration is guaranteed to try to increase refugee numbers to unprecedented levels, ostensibly to \u201cmake up\u201d for lower numbers during this administration. But it will be hard to place 300,000 or 400,000 or 500,000 refugees a year if they all have to go to California and New York and a few other states that virtue-signal their willingness to accept refugees \u2014 not to mention the huge additional welfare costs that would be concentrated in those states.\n\nThere\u2019s no guarantee that the Supreme Court will find rule for Tennessee. It could rule against the state or refuse to hear the case altogether, leaving the lower court decision in place. But you can\u2019t know if you don\u2019t try. And prematurely declaring victory would foreclose this possibility.\n\nOf course, the best way to change legislation is for the legislature to legislate. But since Congress is no longer in the business of making laws, a favorable court ruling is the next best thing \u2014 certainly better than an executive order that could prove illusory.", "description": "Overselling the administration\u2019s refugee reforms may short-circuit a more enduring potential change by the courts.", "authors": ["Mark Krikorian", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
