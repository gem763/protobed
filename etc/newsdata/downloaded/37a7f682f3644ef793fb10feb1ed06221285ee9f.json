Fried is also the only Democrat to hold statewide office in Florida, but since elected in 2018 she\u2019s not introduced any big overhaul to the concealed carry process that would impact legal gun owners. That could soon change, unfortunately.\n\nFlorida\u2019s Commissioner of Agriculture Nikki Fried is asking the state legislature to implement sweeping changes to the concealed carry process in Florida. She wants to keep fingerprints for concealed carry holders on file for five years and also reduce the renewal period from seven to five years. In addition she wants to require applicants take a concealed carry course each time they renew their license, not just when they first apply.\n\nThis sounds like a money grab more than an effort to boost public safety. Florida has around 2-million concealed carry licensees, and forcing them to renew every five years instead of every seven years would generate millions dollars in fees for state. Fried\u2019s proposal to require a concealed carry course with every renewal wouldn\u2019t necessarily put more money in state coffers, but it would lead to concealed carry holders forking over more money to exercise a constitutionally protected right.\n\nFried says she wants to simply ensure the safety of concealed carry holders by requiring the coursework with every renewal.\n\n\u201cIf you have gone through a course one year and then you\u2019ve waited five or seven years, haven\u2019t picked up your gun again, haven\u2019t cleaned it, haven\u2019t gone back to the range your likelihood of you harming yourself if you need it increases,\u201d said Fried.\n\nHonestly, that explanation doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to me. Let\u2019s say that a Floridian (we\u2019ll call him Mickey) gets his concealed carry license, then doesn\u2019t pick up his gun for seven years. If Mickey even bothers to renew his concealed carry permit, he\u2019s likely to continue to not pick up his gun. What good will repeating the course do for Mickey?\n\nIf, on the other hand, Mickey is like most concealed carry licensees, he\u2019ll be carrying his firearm throughout the seven years that his license is valid. He may even choose to get additional training and education on his own. But making Mickey repeat the course when he already knows the subject matter is a waste of his time and money.\n\nFried isn\u2019t the only politician in Florida proposing changes to the state\u2019s concealed carry system. State Rep. Al Jacquet wants individuals applying for a concealed carry license to have a doctor\u2019s note that states the applicant \u201cdoesn\u2019t have any serious mental illness\u201d, which is (no pun intended) a crazy thing to require.\n\nAgriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, who runs the concealed-weapons permit program, said she welcomed Jacquet\u2019s \u201ccontribution\u201d to the debate but didn\u2019t commit to it when asked about a mental health examination for a concealed weapons permit. \u201cIf we\u2019re gong to make an honest effort to take on the issue of gun violence, all ideas need to be considered \u2013 everyone deserves a seat at the table for this discussion,\u201d said Fried.\n\nThe good news for Florida gun owners is that any proposal by Fried or anti-gun lawmakers like Jacquet are going to have to be approved by the legislature, which has Republican majorities in both chambers. The bad news for Florida gun owners is that those same lawmakers passed a \u201cred flag\u201d law in 2018, which means they may be amenable to further erosions of the right to keep and bear arms in the legislative session that begins in January.", "description": "The Florida Ag Commissioner who oversees the state's concealed carry licensing wants to make big changes that will increase costs for gun owners.", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/townhall/reu/o/2018/337/7a8c7dfd-30c6-4439-9dcb-159c3491c8f9.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
