Just recently we were reminded of the need for more oversight when it comes to abortion, not less, with the appalling case of the abortionist Ulrich Klopfer who collected thousands of aborted babies\u2019 bodies in his home,\u201d she said.\n\nThe case, June Medical Services v. Gee, is closely linked to another case, Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, which centered around a Texas law that inspired the Louisiana law and was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2016. In that decision, now-retired justice Anthony M. Kennedy joined the court\u2019s four liberals to form a majority. Since then, President Trump has added two new justices to the Court to form a conservative majority, and pro-life supporters are hopeful the precedent can be overturned and Roe v. Wade can be challenged.\n\nLast year, an appeals court in New Orleans upheld the Louisiana law, asserting that doctors could obtain admitting privileges if they persisted. In February, the Supreme Court issued an order temporarily suspending the law in a 5\u20134 vote in a signal that it was considering hearing the case on appeal. Chief Justice John G. Roberts cast his vote with four liberal justices, while the four conservatives dissented.", "description": "The Supreme Court announced Friday it will review a challenge to a Louisiana law that requires doctors at abortion clinics to have admitting privileges.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Andrew C.
