In a joint statement, Jenna and Chan explained they felt like \"two best-friends realising it\u2019s time to take some space and help each other live the most joyous, fulfilled lives as possible.\"\n\nAnd judging by their current relationship statuses, it would appear they've done exactly that. While Channing often playing proud boyfriend to Jessie J, Jenna currently pregnant with her first child with boyfriend Steve Kazee.\n\nBut it doesn't sound like it was an easy transition. Writing in her new book Gracefully You: How To Live Your Best Life Every Day, in excerpts acquired by People, Jenna opens up about the divorce, and where her relationship with Channing went wrong.\n\nPhoto credit: Getty Images More\n\n\"People grow and they change and sometimes they don\u2019t grow and change together,\" she explains. \"So it wasn\u2019t a overnight thing that happened. There was no one event. I think it was just a slow realisation that we wanted different things.\"\n\nSpeaking of how she felt about the divorce at the time, she continued, \" I was just gutted. It was so difficult for me. It was the loss of an idealistic future for myself and my life. What does that now look like for me? Where do I begin? I met him when I was 24, I didn\u2019t know life without Chan.\"\n\nPhoto credit: Getty Images More\n\nThe dancer and actress then went on to discuss how co-parenting of their six-year-old daughter Everly was going. \"We\u2019re all aware that it\u2019s a new normal, we\u2019re all getting used to it. You can still have a relationship and just because the forms change as to who you are to each other, it doesn\u2019t take away from the love that we had or that we shared all those years.\"\n\nSounds like they've got it on lock.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "SO WERE WE JENNA", "authors": ["Dusty Baxter-Wright"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kM.B.6JHXfRWzCFws695tA--~B/aD03MjI7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmo_633/167f3a8d3f984b79e17a49fd6474b2a1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
