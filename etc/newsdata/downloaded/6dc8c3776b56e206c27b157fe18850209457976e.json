It's not a good look for our democracy, it's not a good look for the Republican Party.\"\n\nBoykin noted that 47 GOP congressmen were \"already on these committees\" who had access to impeachment investigation, stressing they represented a \"quarter of the entire Republican caucus.\"\n\nCNN anchor Jake Tapper later pushed back, pointing to President Trump's \"lynching\" remark and calling Boykin's Klan comparison \"a little strong.\"\n\nDAVID BOSSIE: REPUBLICANS RIGHT TO PROTEST SCHIFF'S IMPEACHMENT WITCH HUNT\n\nBut, Boykin doubled down.\n\n\"I used it purposefully because there's a visual problem too,\" he told Tapper. \"They have this group of almost all-white men going in defense of a white man, who is already, I think by most accounts, a racist, instead of dealing with the issue of how this person is abusing his powers as president of the United States.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBoykin added, \"I'm sure I'll get complaints on Twitter, but I believe that.\"\n\nDefending the move, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., said Wednesday: \"We're going to try to figure out what\u2019s going on, on behalf of the millions of Americans that we represent that want to see this Congress working for them and not obsess with attacking a president who we believe has not done anything to deserve impeachment.\"\n\nFox News' Ronn Blitzer and Chad Pergram contributed to this report.", "description": "A CNN commentator on Thursday linked GOP lawmakers who crashed a closed-door impeachment hearing to a \"Klan group.\"", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
