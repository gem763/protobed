We need to be better for it.\"\n\nThe victory secured Mexico's spot at next summer's Olympics.\n\nWATCH | Mexico defeats Canada to secure spot at Tokyo 2020:\n\nMexico edged Canada 2-1 at the WBSC Americas Olympics Qualifiers to book their ticket to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Canada will battle Brazil on Sunday for the final berth in the next Olympic Games. 1:02\n\nCanada, ranked No. 3 in the world, went into Saturday's game having won every game they'd played in the tournament while not giving up a single run.\n\nThat changed in the fifth inning when Canadian pitcher Sara Groenewegen gave up a runs to Mexico's Brittany Cervantes and Marissa Bravo.\n\nThe bases were loaded with no outs when Groenewegen was replaced by Jenna Caira.\n\nSmith said he would usually bring a reliever in earlier but made a coaching error by second-guessing himself.\n\n\"At the end of the day, that may have been the outcome of the ball game,\" he said.\n\nCaira allowed a hit and a walk before veteran Danielle Lawrie was brought in to finish the inning.\n\nWATCH | Coach Smith on Canada's quest for Olympic berth:\n\nCanadian softball head coach Mark Smith details what his team has to do to grab a berth in the 2020 Olympics. 1:52\n\nSmith said he tries to put pitchers in situations where they can thrive but that didn't happen with Caira on Saturday.\n\n\"Jenna's not a strike-out pitcher and when you bring her into a situation where you need a strikeout, it's a bit of a flip of the coin because she has to rely so much on her off-speed pitch,\" he said. \"So that's my fault for allowing it to get to the point where it could be a difference maker.\"\n\nLawrie threw 15 pitches to finish the game, registering two strikeouts. She did not allow a single hit.\n\nDallas Escobedo pitched all seven innings for Mexico, allowing just three hits and one run. She also registered seven strikeouts.\n\nEmma Entzminger scored Canada's lone tally in the third inning after Victoria Hayward hit a double to deep centre field.\n\nThe Canadians had ample opportunities to add runs, Smith said, including in the sixth inning when they had a lead-off double.\n\n\"We didn't have a lot of chances to score but they gave us a few and we didn't capitalize, we didn't execute when we needed to. Whether the moment got a little too big for some of them we don't know, but better now that a year from now,\" he said.\n\n\"Often times when you don't get it done on your end of it, the other team just needs one opportunity. And they capitalized and hats off to Mexico because they did.\"\n\nOlympics still in sight\n\nCanada will play No. 14-ranked Brazil Sunday in the final game for both sides. A win for Canada would secure the national squad's spot at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nDespite Saturday's result, Smith isn't planning to make any major changes when his team faces Brazil.\n\n\"Today's a bit of a hiccup and I think if I do things a little differently, we win the ball game 1-0. So that's on me,\" he said.\n\nCanada last faced the Brazilians in the preliminary round of the 2015 Pan American Games in Toronto. The Canadians took a 6-0 victory and eventually captured gold in the tournament.\n\nCanada isn't underestimating Brazil heading into Sunday's match up.\n\n\"They're scrappy. They keep coming at you,\" he said. \"They seem to show up and play hard against every body they play against. So we cannot afford to take anything for granted.\"", "description": "Canada's women's softball team suffered its first lost at the Softball Americas Olympic Qualifier on Saturday, dropping a 2-1 decision to Mexico.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5267141.1567290811!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/sof-team-canada-20190829.jpg"}
