A G7 spokesman could not be reached for comment.\n\nHowever, Facebook's executive in charge of the Libra project said earlier this month that losing the backing of major firms was \"liberating\". David Marcus added: \"You know you're on to something when so much pressure builds up.\"", "description": "Leaders of the G7 group of the world's biggest economies issue warning about digital coins like Libra.", "authors": ["Szu Ping Chan", "Business Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/72EC/production/_109202492_whatsubject.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
