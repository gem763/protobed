No principal should make it this far while subsequently needing a book like this,\" one person wrote on Twitter. \"She a bad principal,\" wrote another.\n\nSome defended the book, however, and the principal's efforts to educate herself.\n\n\"She's making an effort to connect with her students, it's more than most principals do,\" another tweet read.\n\nThe board said it was surprised by the uproar and hoped people would look up the book before jumping to conclusions based on its title.\n\nThe principal intends to address the photo in a public announcement and invite any students with lingering questions to see her, said Bruce Campbell, the board's spokesman.\n\n'A colonized kind of world view'\n\nThe book, written by three researchers and published in 2017, aims to improve outcomes for black students by helping teachers create learning environments in which they feel nurtured and engaged. The title references the fact that white women make up the bulk of the teaching force in the U.S.\n\nCoutinho said the book asks educators to challenge the biases they may bring into the classroom.\n\n\"We know that we're steeped in a colonized kind of world view and how do we break out of that in our everyday practices?\" she said, noting it has been used in the board's anti-oppression training in the past.\n\nCardinal Ambrozic's new principal was involved in a book study at several schools that delved deeply into the text last year, Coutinho said.\n\n\"If we're going to make any changes to the education system, we have to start talking about these things and talking about them openly and honestly without shame or blame.\"", "description": "A Toronto-area Catholic school board says an online firestorm that erupted after a book on how to teach black students was\u00a0photographed on a principal's desk stems from a misunderstanding\u00a0over the book's contents.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5272346.1567716860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/cardinal-ambrozic-catholic-secondary-school-principal.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
