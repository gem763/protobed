This growth will be fueled by collaboration app expansion into emerging markets and a growing base of knowledge workers hoping to stay engaged. Gartner's Digital Worker Survey, based on 7,261 people, found that 58% of respondents use real-time messaging tools daily with 45% on social media daily.\n\nAnd this just in: The market isn't going to have any big winners and will remain fragmented. Gartner is betting that the collaboration software will stay focused on narrow use cases even as most enterprise vendors layer in some form of social features such as analytics, virtual personal assistants and team management tools.

The challenge will revolve around preventing silos and integrating vendors like Slack, Microsoft and Google to name a few. This growth in applications and collaboration players is being fueled by enterprises chasing the productivity and smart office dream.\n\nIf Gartner's projections are correct, enterprises are likely headed to collaboration sprawl. Enterprises already have a number of video conferencing tools--Zoom, Cisco WebEx, Microsoft, Blue Jeans etc--as well as messaging systems such as Slack, Google Hangouts and Microsoft Teams. Employees may mix and match these systems daily.\n\nMore:", "description": "Enterprises keep looking for ways to enable employees to collaborate better.
