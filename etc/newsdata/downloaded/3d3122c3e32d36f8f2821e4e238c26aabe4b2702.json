Braskem is partly owned by Odebrecht and Petrobras.\n\nThe settlements with U.S., Brazilian and Swiss authorities have spawned corruption probes in other Latin American countries where the two companies operate. Last month, Odebrecht filed for chapter 15 bankruptcy in the U.S. shortly after it filed for bankruptcy in Brazil in June.\n\nThe IDB said its investigation revealed evidence of bribes paid by Odebrecht during a contract for a hydroelectric power plant in Venezuela and a highway rehabilitation project in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.\n\nUnder the terms of the settlement announced Wednesday, Odebrecht didn\u2019t contest the evidence, the IDB said. The company won\u2019t be required to pay the $50 million in charitable contributions until 2024.\n\nCNO SA, a subsidiary of Odebrecht, will be debarred from bidding on IDB projects for six years, the IDB said.\n\nAnother subsidiary, Odebrecht Engenharia e Constru\u00e7\u00e3o SA, will be conditionally non-debarred for 10 years. Under a conditional non-debarment, the subsidiary will be eligible to participate in IDB-financed projects if it fully meets the conditions of the settlement.\n\nA number of other CNO and Odebrecht Engenharia subsidiaries were also debarred or conditionally debarred under the settlement, IDB said.\n\nWrite to Dylan Tokar at dylan.tokar@wsj.com", "description": "Brazilian construction conglomerate Odebrecht SA will pay $50 million in charitable contributions to resolve allegations of bribery under a deal reached with a Latin American development bank.", "authors": ["Dylan Tokar"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104084/social"}
