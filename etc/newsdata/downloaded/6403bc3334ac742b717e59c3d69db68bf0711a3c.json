Social media and comment sections have trained us to channel our negative feelings into words, and our positive feelings into likes. So negativity is laid out in detail in the comments and replies, while positivity is compressed into a number. Scrolling through it all, or having it happen to something you post, is exhausting. The solution is simple.\n\nDesigner Frank Chimero blames this on social media lacking a dislike button. Of course, a dislike button would cause all kinds of trouble, as it does on Reddit, where \u201cdownvotes\u201d bury valuable comments. So there\u2019s only the option to like, or the option to explain that you dislike.\n\nAs I\u2019ve written elsewhere, the internet needs a dislike button that doesn\u2019t actually do anything. But as Chimero points out, you have a more immediate personal solution:\n\nWhenever you hit \u201clike,\u201d leave a positive comment\n\nObvious in retrospect, right? Plenty of people already do this. You might, as I do, scoff at their inane commentary. You might even wish your older relatives would stop commenting \u201cOMG cute!\u201d on your Instagram, and just hit the heart. But those people are doing it right! They\u2019re the ones who seem to actually enjoy the internet, because they spend their time being positive.\n\nYou can leave positive comments without being inane. Think about what you liked about the post, and say it. Ask your friend where they got that nice hat, or what they\u2019re up to on vacation. Tell them how much their little life observation means to you. Or, you know, write something that directs your full intelligence toward expressing joy and appreciation.\n\nIt makes the original poster feel better\n\nEven if you\u2019re like me, a ghoul who gets annoyed at content-free replies from my loved ones, you still prefer that to actual negative replies. When you post something meaningful or funny, you want to witness people enjoying it. And a number next to a heart is not really going to deliver that. It\u2019s like playing Super Mario for the points.\n\nWhen someone compliments you, you feel good, you remember it, you might even tell a friend about the nice compliment you got. When someone tells you something nice (or something nasty), you might remember it for years. No one fondly remembers a like.\n\nNext time you hit like, imagine what kind of reaction you\u2019d give in person, and give it in writing. Give them real thoughts and feelings to absorb. Give them compliments\u2014or empathy or agreement\u2014in words that they\u2019ll remember.\n\nIt makes you feel better\n\nThe more time you spend leaving these positive comments, the less time is left for the negative ones.\n\nI have a terrible habit of joining angry mobs on Twitter. I see some hateful, bigoted tweet, and I just have to reply with a rebuttal or put-down. I try to only do this to people who really deserve to feel bad. But it doesn\u2019t really make me feel good. Even when everyone\u2019s having fun joining the pile-on, there\u2019s a lingering taste of poison. And I\u2019m not accomplishing anything. This behaviour is so common that getting \u201cratioed\u201d with more replies than likes has become shorthand for having a famously terrible tweet.\n\nBut this shit-river of negativity has triggered an opposite behaviour, based on positive replies. On \u201cPrompt Twitter,\u201d someone asks an open-ended question and invites everyone to answer. The tweet gets ratioed with positive comments. Everyone loves to share their opinion, but this time they\u2019re on the same side as the person who got them talking. Everyone\u2019s spending their time on the positivity.\n\nYou start a real conversation\n\n\u201cA like can\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d says Chimero, \u201cbut a compliment can go a long way.\u201d It can start a conversation, an actual back-and-forth, that breaks you out of the search-and-consume pattern.\n\nSelf-made experts on \u201cunplugging\u201d keep claiming that social media makes us lonely, but that\u2019s only true if we only produce and consume and never interact. It\u2019s the mums and aunts and grandpas who are doing it right, using Facebook to keep in touch and constantly chat with all their faraway friends and family. The fans replying to celebrity tweets. The YouTube commenters sharing personal stories under an old music video. The Lifehacker commenters telling me how good this post is.\n\nYou\u2019re taking a pleasant or meaningful moment, expanding the space it takes up in your mind, and extending it into new moments. A small, mundane, banal choice that makes life better.", "description": "The like button ruined the internet.
