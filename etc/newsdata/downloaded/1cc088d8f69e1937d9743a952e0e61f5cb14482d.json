Yes, we appreciate that South Africans have a legitimate right to want to know who funded the campaign, but there was no obligation on the part of the president or the campaign to release that particular information,\" Diko said.\n\nREAD MORE | ANALYSIS: Ramaphosa's donors are hanging him out to dry\n\n\"There is no regulation that requires for that information to be made public, and a lot of those donors would have donated because it was going to be confidential.\n\n\"I want to reiterate. This is just smoke and mirrors. At the core of it, the president has not committed any crime. None of those donations are coming from anybody, to the best of our knowledge, who would have gotten that money illegally,\" she added.\n\nThe emails obtained by News24 formed part of Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane\u2019s report into complaints by the Democratic Alliance (DA) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) over a response given by Ramaphosa to DA leader Mmusi Maimane in Parliament, in November 2018.\n\nMaimane asked about a supposed payment to the president\u2019s son, Andile, from corruption-accused company Bosasa.\n\n'It\u2019s a bit concerning'\n\nBut it turned out, the payment mentioned by Maimane was actually a donation to the CR17 campaign by Bosasa CEO Gavin Watson \u2013 which Ramaphosa himself revealed in a letter to the speaker of Parliament.\n\nMkhwebane found that Ramaphosa had deliberately misled Parliament over the donation.\n\nRamaphosa has indicated he will challenge the report in court.\n\nREAD MORE | EXCLUSIVE: Leaked emails reveal who Ramaphosa's CR17 campaign asked for money\n\nAs part of reaching her conclusion that Ramaphosa was involved in the fundraising of the campaign, Mkhwebane relied on the same emails leaked to News24.\n\nDiko said the Presidency did not wish to cast aspersions on any person for the leaking of the emails, but added that the office was concerned.\n\n\"This campaign sought to create a higher standard. One of many campaigns, the president was not the only person contesting that election and surely not the only person who would have sought to raise money. He did not raise it from public bodies, it was private individuals who donated,\" Diko said.\n\n\"We do not want to cast aspersions on any person for the leaking of the emails. It\u2019s a bit concerning\u2026 who is it that would have access to the head of state\u2019s private communications?\" Diko asked.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
