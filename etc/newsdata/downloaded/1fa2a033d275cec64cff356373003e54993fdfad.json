At this point there are no observations of any oil spill at sea,\u201d it added.\n\nAn undated photo of the facility showed it has 10 large storage tanks located on a plot of land by the ocean.\n\nAll of Equinor\u2019s 54 employees on the island are confirmed safe and accounted for, the company said.\n\nIn preparation for the hurricane, Equinor shut down operations at the South Riding Point terminal on Aug. 31, and none of its staff were at the site during the storm.\n\n\u201cWe have informed the local authorities of our initial assessment and remain in dialogue with them,\u201d Equinor said.\n\n\u201cWhile weather conditions on the island have improved, road conditions and flooding continue to impact our ability to assess the situation and the scope of damages to the terminal and its surroundings.\u201d", "description": "Equinor has discovered an oil spill at its storage terminal in the Bahamas in the aftermath of hurricane Dorian, the Norwegian energy company said in a statement on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
