Love U.K.\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCorbyn told reporters he would attempt to challenge Johnson with a vote of no confidence after Johnson announced in a letter to Conservative MPs that he would ask Queen Elizabeth II to suspend Parliament just weeks ahead of the Oct. 31 Brexit date.\n\nCritics have contended that Johnson\u2019s surprise move is an attempt to shorten the time MPs have to block a no deal Brexit. Johnson, however, says he want to present a new agenda to the country in a queen\u2019s speech that will open a new session of Parliament, and reassured MPs that Parliament will have \u201cample time\u201d to debate Brexit.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Trump has injected himself into the Brexit debate. During a news conference at the G-7 meeting earlier this week, Trump said former Prime Minister Theresa May would\u2019ve been able to cut a deal if she had taken his advice.\n\n\u201cTheresa was unable to do the deal. I gave her my ideas as to doing the deal very early on and you possibly know what they are. She chose to do it her way and that didn\u2019t work out so well,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump\u2019s national security adviser, John Bolton, has also proposed sectoral U.S.-U.K. trade deals post-Brexit.\n\nJohnson has said the U.K. will leave the European Union on Oct. 31, with or without a deal.", "description": "This isn\u2019t the first time Trump has injected himself into the Brexit debate.", "authors": ["Evan Semones"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/af/c8/425c83734e84a1da447082d28ff6/webp.net-resizeimage%20(14).jpg"}
