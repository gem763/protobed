Several personal lawyers for the president dealing with the subject. A lurking presence at Capitol Hill impeachment-focused hearings. Aggressive legal briefs and countersuits foiling efforts to gather fuel for potential proceedings. Near-daily media appearances discussing the topic.\n\nThis technically nonexistent yet omnipresent force has been critical in stymying Democrats\u2019 attempts to build their case for removing Trump from office. Trump\u2019s lawyers have helped block testimony from former White House counsel Don McGahn \u2014 a key player in the most potentially damning stories from Robert Mueller\u2019s report \u2014 fought lawmakers and prosecutors trying to see the president\u2019s personal tax returns and protected the former special counsel\u2019s most sensitive secrets. They\u2019ve also advised ex-Trump staffers like Corey Lewandowski and Hope Hicks as they faced grillings from congressional Democrats.\n\nThat the president\u2019s representatives don\u2019t want to call their work what it is \u2014 preventing Trump\u2019s potential impeachment \u2014 is no surprise. Any recognition that they\u2019ve taken such an official step would be a giant red flag that they think things are more serious than they are. Still, the Trump lawyers\u2019 combined mission effectively is to stop impeachment before it starts.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com Story"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
