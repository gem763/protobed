Robert Luskin, an attorney for Sondland, said his client has no recollection of the alleged discussion.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s quite clear we have a surfeit of evidence that corroborates in full every aspect of what happened and the policy they were pursuing,\u201d Rep. Gerald Connolly (D-VA), a member of the House Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees, said in a statement to the Post.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) told the Post:\n\nThis is the role that whistleblowers play: Whistleblowers are the people who set off a process by telling the truth. The whistleblower will go down in history as a hero for kicking off this process. But the whistleblower is no longer integral to the investigation in any way.\n\nAppearing October 13th on CBS News Face the Nation, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) said the so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d testimony \u201cmight not be necessary.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans, including President Donald Trump, have called for the so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d identity to be revealed and for he or she to testify publically.\n\nThe president tweeted Thursday:\n\nWhere is the Whistleblower, and why did he or she write such a fictitious and incorrect account of my phone call with the Ukrainian President? Why did the IG allow this to happen? Who is the so-called Informant (Schiff?) who was so inaccurate? A giant Scam!\n\nThe so-called \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d whose report prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to launch an impeachment inquiry, has had their credibility called into question in recent weeks. According to CNN and the Washington Examiner, the anonymous individual is not only a registered Democrat, but also worked with Biden in the Obama White House.", "description": "House Dems believe there is sufficient evidence to advance their closed door impeachment inquiry without\u00a0testimony from the \"whistleblower,\"", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1060213698-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
