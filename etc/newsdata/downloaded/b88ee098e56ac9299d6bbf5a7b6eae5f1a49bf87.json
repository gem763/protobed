My birthday\u2019s next month. You can\u2019t lie about age. My Malibu house burned down. In an accident, my son was severely injured. I\u2019ve had illness, which forced a change in eating habits. I moved into a home that had black mold,' she said during an interview with Page Six.\n\n'So I\u2019ve gathered myself together. Renegotiated. I\u2019ve lectured, been on the Shopping Channel. I\u2019m going retail. I will not be a victim.'\n\nShe is best known for playing Chrissy Snow on Three's Company in 1977.
