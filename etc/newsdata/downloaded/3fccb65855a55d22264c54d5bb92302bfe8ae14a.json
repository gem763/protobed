YPG fighters could either defect or Ankara would have to \u201cstop them from disrupting our counter-Islamic State efforts\u201d, he wrote.\n\nIn a Tweet on Wednesday, Trump said: \u201cTurkey MUST take over captured ISIS fighters that Europe refused to have returned\u201d, referring to large numbers of foreign Islamic State fighters currently held by Kurdish-led forces.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Demiroren news agency said Syrian rebels travelled from northwest Syria to Turkey in preparation for the incursion.\n\nThey will be based in the Turkish border town of Ceylanpinar, it said, across the border from the Syrian town of Ras al-Ain, with 14,000 of them gradually joining the offensive.\n\nThe Hamza Brigade rebels from the National Army, the main rebel grouping that Turkey supports in northwest Syria, moved in a bus convoy along with trucks carrying ammunition, DHA said.\n\n\u201cThe National Army forces are still preparing for the start of operations east of the Euphrates (river) and they have started moving to the frontlines,\u201d National Army spokesman Youssef Hammoud said.\n\nA Turkish miltary convoy is pictured in Kilis near the Turkish-Syrian border, Turkey, October 9, 2019. Mehmet Ali Dag/ Ihlas News Agency (IHA) via REUTERS\n\nA convoy of buses carrying Syrian rebel fighters and trucks loaded with equipment arrived at the Turkish border town of Akcakale early on Wednesday, a Reuters witness said.\n\nAt Akcakale, across from Syria\u2019s Tel Abyad, howitzers were deployed behind earth embankments and pointed towards Syria, a Reuters witness said on Tuesday. Multiple launch rocket systems were stationed at Suruc, some 60 km (40 miles) to the west, opposite the Syrian border town of Kobani, he said.\n\nThree vehicles carrying Syrian rebels drove on Turkey\u2019s side of the border area in Akcakale, a Reuters witness aid. A man in one vehicle waved a rebel flag. Others made victory signs.\n\nRUSSIA CALLS FOR DIALOGUE\n\nRussia, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s strongest foreign ally, urged dialogue between Damascus and Syria\u2019s Kurds on solving issues in northeast Syria including border security.\n\n\u201cWe will do our best to support the start of such substantive talks,\u201d Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters during a visit to Kazakhstan.\n\nKurdish-led forces said on Tuesday they might start talks with the Syrian government and Russia to fill a security vacuum in the event of a full U.S. troop withdrawal.\n\nAnother Assad ally, Iran, urged Turkey to show restraint and avoid military action in northern Syria, although it said Turkey was \u201crightfully worried\u201d about its southern border.\n\nThe prospect of a military offensive has unsettled Turkish financial markets, with the lira this week hitting its weakest level since late August. The currency TRYTOM=D3 firmed slightly to 5.8220 against the dollar on Wednesday morning.\n\nOn Monday, Erdogan said U.S. troops started to pull back after a call he had with Trump, adding talks between Turkish and U.S. officials on the matter would go on.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to pull back troops has rattled allies, including France and Britain, two of Washington\u2019s main partners in the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State.\n\nTurkish army howitzers are positioned on the Turkish-Syrian border, near the southeastern town of Akcakale in Sanliurfa province, Turkey, October 7, 2019.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged all parties in northeast Syria to exercise maximum restraint and protect civilians.\n\nKurdish-led forces denounced the U.S. policy shift as a \u201cstab in the back\u201d.
