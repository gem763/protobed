The paper added that there is a belief in the Japanese cabinet that giving in to Korea would send the government's approval ratings into tailspin.\n\nTokyo is therefore preparing additional trade retaliation against Korea in a deepening spat over compensating Korean victims of wartime forced labor. It is also bracing itself for dwindling numbers of Korean tourists, who accounted for 24 percent of all foreign visitors last year with 7.54 million, and make up for the shortfall with visitors from China.\n\nThe Japanese Foreign Ministry announced Sunday that in order to increase efficiency of visa issuance and improve convenience, it will accept online visa applications from Chinese tourists from next April.\n\nCurrently Chinese travelers have to apply at a consular office in person. Last year some 8.38 million Chinese visited Japan, and Tokyo hopes to increase that to 10 million this year.\n\nWhen asked about decreasing number of Korean tourists, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said, \"We have an 11-percent increase in the number of Chinese tourists instead, and also have a two-digit growth rate of tourists from the U.S. and Europe. There will be no big damage.\"\n\nThe ministry also issued a travel warning for Korea amid anti-Japanese protests here. It advised Japanese nationals to pay attention to latest updates provided by their embassy, not to approach demonstrations, and take extra care when traveling around.\n\n", "description": "Japan Braces for Long Cold War with Korea", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-08-06"}
