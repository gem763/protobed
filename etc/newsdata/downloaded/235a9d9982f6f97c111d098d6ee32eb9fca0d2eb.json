LOUIS (AP) - The St. Louis Cardinals clinched the NL Central on the final day of the regular season, using Jack Flaherty\u2019s arm and Matt Carpenter\u2019s bat Sunday to win their first division title since 2015 with a 9-0 victory over the Chicago Cubs.\n\nThe Cubs lost on Joe Maddon\u2019s day as their manager. It was announced before the game that he won\u2019t return next year.\n\nFlaherty tossed seven impressive innings and Carpenter led a three-homer attack with a three-run drive to help St. Louis advanced to the NL Division Series, starting Thursday at Atlanta.\n\nManager Mike Shildt and the Cardinals began the day with a one-game lead over Milwaukee. The second-place Brewers will play at Washington in the NL wild-card game Tuesday night, with the winner going on to play Los Angeles in the NLDS.\n\nPaul Goldschmidt and Dexter Fowler also homered for St. Louis, which is back in the postseason after a three-year absence.\n\nST. LOUIS (AP) - Chicago Cubs manager Joe Maddon will not be back with the team next season after it failed to make the playoffs for the first time in five years.\n\nMaddon and Cubs president of baseball operations Theo Epstein announced the move before the team\u2019s season finale at St. Louis. Maddon\u2019s contract expires after Sunday\u2019s game.\n\nThe change in the dugout begins what could be an active offseason for the Cubs, and Maddon once again becomes one of baseball\u2019s top free agents.\n\nWhile Maddon is out after five seasons, he is tied to Chicago forever after managing the Cubs to the 2016 World Series title for the franchise\u2019s first championship in 108 years.\n\nChicago also made it to the NL Championship Series in 2015 and 2017, but it faltered in September each of the last two seasons. The Cubs finished third in the NL Central this year.\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) - The Pirates fired manager Clint Hurdle before Sunday\u2019s regular season finale against Cincinnati following a stunning second-half collapse that dropped Pittsburgh to the bottom of the National League Central and included a series of off-the-field issues.\n\nPittsburgh entered Sunday 69-92, including a 25-47 since the All-Star break.\n\nHurdle went 735-720 in nine seasons with Pittsburgh, helping the franchise emerge from 20 years of losing to reach the playoffs three straight years from 2013-15. The Pirates never advanced past the Division Series and are assured of a third losing season in their last four years. Hurdle had two years left on an extension he signed in 2017.\n\nPittsburgh general manager Neal Huntington called it \u201can extremely difficult decision\u201d for the organization.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Mets slugger Pete Alonso hit his 53rd home run of the season Saturday night, breaking the rookie record Yankees star Aaron Judge set in 2017.\n\nAlonso launched a 93 mph fastball on a 1-2 count from Atlanta Braves starter Mike Foltynewicz just to the right of straightaway center field. The solo shot gave New York a 3-0 lead in the third inning.\n\nAs the 415-foot drive landed in the seats, Alonso raised both arms in triumph while running to first base - and Mets teammates came out of the dugout to congratulate the 24-year-old first baseman. Fans at Citi Field gave him a standing ovation and Alonso raised both arms again, tilted his head back and looked skyward as he stood in front of the dugout.\n\nOvercome with emotion, Alonso had tears in his eyes when he went to first base in the fourth.\n\nNFL\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - The NFL has agreed with game officials on a seven-year labor contract that will run through the 2025 season.\n\nThe deal announced Saturday came with the current contract set to expire in May. The new agreement lasts through May 2026.\n\nLeague executive vice president Troy Vincent says the agreement \u201csolidifies the working partnership between the league and officials toward the common goal of developing and training the best officials in the world.\u201d\n\nThe new collective bargaining agreement covers compensation and benefits and emphasizes efforts to train and develop officials.\n\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL\n\nAlabama is No. 1 in The Associated Press college football poll for the first time this season, replacing preseason No. 1 Clemson after the Tigers had a close call.\n\nAlabama received 29 of 61 first-place votes Sunday from the media panel as the Tigers\u2019 one-point victory at North Carolina gave the AP Top 25 presented by Regions Bank the first shake-up at the top this season. Clemson slipped to No. 2 and received 18 first-place votes.\n\nThe last time a No. 1 team won and dropped was Ohio State on Nov. 7, 2015, after the Buckeyes beat Minnesota 28-14 at home. It has happened 74 times previously since the poll started in 1936.\n\nNo. 3 Georgia received four first-place votes. Ohio State moved up to No. 4 and received seven first-place votes. LSU was No. 5 and Oklahoma sixth. No. 7 Auburn received three first-place votes.\n\nAt the other end of the rankings, No. 24 SMU is ranked for the first time since the program received the so-called death penalty for NCAA rules violations in 1987 and did not compete for two seasons.\n\nHOCKEY\n\nA person with knowledge of the move says the Colorado Avalanche agreed to terms with Mikko Rantanen on a $55.5 million, six-year contract.\n\nThe person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Saturday because the deal had not been announced.\n\nRantanen will count $9.25 million against the salary cap. He\u2019s one of the final restricted free agents to sign a contract.\n\nThe 22-year-old Finn set career highs with 31 goals, 56 assists and 87 points last season. Rantanen has 209 points in 239 NHL games.\n\n-By AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno.\n\nNASCAR\n\nCONCORD, N.C. (AP) - Chase Elliott recovered from a costly mistake to win NASCAR\u2019s first elimination race and advance into the second round of the playoffs.\n\nNASCAR\u2019s second trip to The Roval, a hybrid road course and oval at Charlotte Motor Speedway, was sloppy from start to finish on a scorching hot Sunday. Temperatures inside the cars hovered near 120 degrees during a late red-flag stoppage.\n\nElliott passed Kevin Harvick on the inside as they raced through a chicane with five laps remaining to earn his third victory of the season. Earlier in the race, he locked his brakes on a restart as the leader and drove directly into a tire barrier.\n\nHe celebrated the win by returning his Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet to the same tire barrier, nosing it in and burning his tires in white, billowy puffs.\n\nThe attention was on the bottom of the 16-driver championship field to see which four drivers would be eliminated from the playoffs. Ryan Newman gave away his chance at advancing when he missed a chicane trying to hold off Aric Almirola.\n\nIt allowed Almirola to pass him, cost Newman a point that swung in Alex Bowman\u2019s favor and earned Bowman a spot in the second round.\n\nNewman, Almirola, Kurt Busch and Erik Jones were eliminated from the playoffs.\n\nGOLF\n\nNAPA, Calif. (AP) - Cameron Champ made a 3-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole for a one-stroke victory over Adam Hadwin on Sunday in the Safeway Open, finishing off an emotional week with his grandfather battling cancer.\n\nThree strokes ahead entering the round, Champ had five birdies and overcame a bogey on No. 17 to hold off Hadwin for his second PGA Tour victory. Champ closed with a 3-under 69 to finish at 17-under 271 at Silverado Resort.\n\nChamp raised both arms then shared a long embrace with his caddie before breaking into tears as he hugged his father on the green. Champ\u2019s grandfather, Mack, is fighting stomach cancer and is in hospice in Sacramento. Mack introduced Champ to golf at a young age.\n\nHadwin birdied the final three holes for a 67 to tie Champ at 16 under, then watched from nearby as Champ nearly chipped in for eagle on the par-5 18th before making the short birdie putt.\n\nPEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) - Kirk Triplett won the Pure Insurance Championship for the third time Sunday at Pebble Beach, beating Billy Andrade with an 8-foot birdie putt on the first hole of a playoff.\n\nThe 57-year-old Triplett also won the PGA Tour Champions event in 2012 and 2013. He has eight senior victories, also winning a playoff in March in the Hoag Classic down the coast in Newport Beach.\n\nPlaying four groups ahead of Andrade, Triplett birdied the 18th in regulation for a 5-under 67 and 9-uner 206 total. Andrade also closed with a birdie, holing a 7-footer after hitting his second shot through the green.\n\nThe 55-year-old Andrade missed a 20-foot birdie try before Triplett holed the winning putt in the event that pairs tour players with juniors from The First Tee programs around the country.\n\nPaul Broadhurst was a stroke out the playoff, shooting a 68. Tom Gillis (69) was 7 under, and Tom Lehman (69), Tom Byrum (69), Billy Mayfair (69) and Marco Dawson (71) were 6 under.\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Mi Jung Hur played bogey-free with the lead Sunday and never gave anyone a chance, closing with a 4-under 68 for a four-shot victory at the Indy Women in Tech Championship for her second LPGA Tour victory this year.\n\nHer opened with a 63 and went wire-to-wire for the first time in her career. The 29-year-old South Korean had 26 birdies for the week at Brickyard Crossing.\n\nNanna Koerstz Madsen birdied her last two holes for a 67 to finish alone in second, moving her from No. 70 to No. 44 in the Race to the CME Globe. Marina Alex finished third. She started two shots out of the lead but didn\u2019t made birdie until the 16th hole.\n\nSHANGHAI (AP) - Lin Yuxin of China made birdie from the bunker on the second playoff hole Sunday to beat defending champion Takumi Kanaya and win the Asia-Pacific Amateur for the second time.\n\nLin won the first playoff in the 11-year-history of the Asia-Pacific Amateur and joined Hideki Matsuyama as the only two-time winners. The victory gets Lin into the Masters and the British Open next year.\n\nHe thought he had thrown away his chance when he laid up into the water on the par-5 18th hole at Sheshan International, making bogey for a 68. Kanaya had a chance to win in regulation, but missed a 7-foot birdie putt.\n\nBoth made birdie on the 18th on the first extra hole. Lin blasted out to 3 feet and made the winning putt.\n\nTRACK AND FIELD\n\nDOHA, Qatar (AP) - Christian Coleman won the world championship gold medal in the men\u2019s 100 meters on Saturday, three weeks after avoiding a ban for missed drug tests.\n\nColeman started well and extended his lead down the stretch to win in 9.76 seconds, beating defending champion Justin Gatlin into second place in the centerpiece race. Andre de Grasse of Canada was third.\n\nColeman had been accused of failing to provide accurate information on his whereabouts for drug testing. The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency dropped the case after determining one of the missed tests should be backdated on a technicality, taking it out of the required 12-month window for violations.\n\nWNBA\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Elena Delle Donne scored 22 points and Ariel Atkins had 21 to help the Washington Mystics beat the Connecticut Sun 95-86 on Sunday in Game 1 of the WNBA Finals.\n\nKristi Toliver added 18 points for the Mystics, who had the best record in the regular season. It\u2019s the first finals win in franchise history for the Mystics, who were swept last year by Seattle in their only other appearance in the championship round. Game 2 of the best-of-five series is Tuesday night in Washington.\n\nThe Mystics were up nine at the half and extended the lead to 17 in the third quarter before Connecticut rallied within four twice in the final period. Delle Donne - the league\u2019s MVP - answered each time for Washington with a basket. Her jumper with 4:56 left made it 82-76 and started a 9-0 run to put the game out of reach. Atkins followed with a 3-pointer that made it a nine-point game and then corralled an offensive rebound that Toliver finished off with a finger roll down the lane with 3:16 left.\n\nThe Sun could only get within eight the rest of the way.\n\nBOBSLED\n\nKaillie Humphries will be allowed to bobsled for the United States this season and beyond, after Canadian officials announced Saturday night that they are granting the two-time Olympic gold medalist\u2019s request to be released from their program.\n\nHumphries has been seeking that release for weeks after filing a harassment complaint against the Canadian program alleging she was mistreated by a coach. She needed to obtain the release by Monday in order to be eligible to slide this season.\n\nCanada was reluctant to grant the release because Humphries is still a medal contender. Canadian officials said Saturday night that \u201cthis was not an easy decision, nor was it one we took lightly.\u201d\n\nUSA Bobsled coach Mike Kohn, when informed of the decision by The Associated Press, said \u201cthis is what we\u2019ve been waiting for and we cannot wait to work with Kaillie.\u201d\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nARCADIA, Calif. (AP) - A horse went down in the stretch and tossed two-time Kentucky Derby-winning jockey Mario Gutierrez in the eighth race at Santa Anita.\n\nThe incident occurred Saturday on the second day of the fall meet at the track where 31 horses have died since December.\n\nEmtech, a 3-year-old colt trained by Steve Knapp, went down in the middle of the track in the upper stretch of the six-furlong, $40,000 claiming race. Gutierrez landed near the inner rail.\n\nWorkers immediately put up a green screen to shield the foundering colt from the crowd, its front legs unable to withstand the animal\u2019s weight.\n\nGutierrez, the 32-year-old rider who won the Kentucky Derby in 2012 and 2016, was taken away by ambulance. A track steward says Gutierrez was up and walking, but still being examined by a track physician.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "MLB", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
