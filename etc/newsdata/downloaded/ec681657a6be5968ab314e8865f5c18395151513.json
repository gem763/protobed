And a spokesman for the House Intelligence Committee declined to confirm whether the Bolton hearing is expected to proceed as scheduled.\n\nWhile Democrats have said for weeks they want to hear from Bolton, Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffSondland emerges as key target after Vindman testimony White House: Democrats' resolution shows impeachment is 'illegitimate sham' House votes to recognize Armenian genocide MORE (D-Calif.) fixed a spotlight on his possible testimony on Sunday.\n\n\u201cObviously he has very relevant information, and we do want him to come in and testify,\u201d Schiff said on ABC's \"This Week,\u201d calling Bolton a \u201cvery important\u201d witness.\n\nThe Intelligence chairman also said he believes the White House will seek to block Bolton from testifying.\n\nAmid the House investigation into Trump\u2019s controversial dealings with Ukraine, Democrats now see the military hawk as a potential star witness \u2014 one whose intimate knowledge of the Ukraine affair could expose more evidence of wrongdoing by the president.\n\nBolton was involved in some of the most explosive events related to Trump's contacts with Kiev, but it\u2019s unclear whether the Republican stalwart would defend Trump\u2019s actions or paint the president's efforts to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open an investigation into political rivals as an abuse of power.\n\nBolton, who departed the White House last month amid conflicts with Trump over major foreign policy matters, is said to have raised concerns about efforts by the president and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiTrump attacks on Vindman trigger backlash AP: Saudi tycoon donated to Obama inauguration through a middleman House committees ask key Mulvaney aide for testimony in impeachment inquiry MORE to get Zelensky to investigate 2020 Democratic candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenWhite House official says transcript of Ukraine call omitted key phrases: report Biden uses National Cat Day to fundraise for putting a 'pet back in White House' Sondland emerges as key target after Vindman testimony MORE and his son Hunter Biden.\n\nLt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council's (NSC) top Ukraine expert, testified Tuesday that during a July 10 meeting, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland \u201cstarted to speak about delivering the specific investigations in order to secure the meeting with the President, at which time Ambassador Bolton cut the meeting short,\u201d according to a copy of his opening remarks.\n\n\u201cFollowing this meeting, there was a scheduled debriefing during which Amb. Sondland emphasized the importance that Ukraine deliver the investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens, and Burisma,\u201d Vindman\u2019s prepared remarks continue.\n\nVindman said he raised his concerns to Sondland that \u201chis statements were inappropriate and that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the NSC was going to get involved in or push.\u201d\n\nVindman said Fiona Hill, Trump\u2019s former leading Russia expert who left voluntarily in July, also voiced her concerns to Sondland.\n\nHill earlier this month told House investigators during her own closed-door deposition that Bolton was so alarmed by what he heard about Trump\u2019s contacts with Ukraine that he instructed her to notify the chief NSC lawyer about Giuliani\u2019s efforts as well as Sondland and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney John (Mick) Michael MulvaneyEx-Trump officials back Russia ambassador pick ahead of hearing The Hill's 12:30 Report: White House official testifies he warned about Trump pressure on Ukraine House committees ask key Mulvaney aide for testimony in impeachment inquiry MORE, The New York Times reported at the time.\n\n\u201cI am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,\u201d Bolton told Hill, according to her reported testimony.\n\nSeparately, Democrats have also requested testimony next week from two other top White House officials with insights into the Ukraine saga: John Eisenberg, senior attorney at the NSC, and one of his deputies, Michael Ellis. The pair has been asked to appear on Monday, according to a source familiar with the impeachment inquiry.\n\nBolton, now a Republican operative, clashed with the president on major policy issues such as North Korea, Iran and Afghanistan, with Trump viewing the longtime hawk as too militant in his approaches. He is reportedly working on a book about his time in the administration.\n\nUpon leaving the White House, Bolton showed he was willing to fight back with the administration, disputing Trump\u2019s claims that he had been fired, rather than offering to submit a letter of resignation a day prior.\n\n\u2014Mike Lillis contributed.
