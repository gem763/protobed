Pentagon officials say their strategy to counter China acknowledges the new paradigm and the uncomfortable truth that unquestioned U.S. power may be a thing of the past.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re no longer in a period of overwhelming American dominance but rather one in which our armed forces are adapting to fight against near-peer competitors who are fielding increasingly sophisticated capabilities,\u201d Randall G. Schriver, assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs, told an audience at the Brookings Institution in Washington just hours after the parade.\n\n\u201cInstead of expecting to dominate an opponent, our armed forces are learning to expect to be contested throughout a fight while achieving the political objectives set for them,\u201d he said.\n\nFrightening display\n\nChinese officials downplayed the idea that the celebration was meant to frighten or intimidate its adversaries. President Xi Jinping again stressed the party lie that China\u2019s \u201cpeaceful rise\u201d should not be considered a threat to its neighbors or to the West. China already ranks as an economic and manufacturing superpower, and it could surpass the U.S. with the world\u2019s largest overall gross domestic product within two years.\n\nIn fact, the celebration drew unexpected congratulations from President Trump, a chief critic of China who has spearheaded a bitter trade war between the two nations.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to President Xi and the Chinese people on the 70th Anniversary of the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u201d the president said in a post on Twitter.\n\nBut the sheer scale of the festivities clearly shows Beijing\u2019s desire to project unprecedented power. The three-hour parade included more than 15,000 troops marching through the streets of the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 a bold demonstration of the People\u2019s Liberation Army, which is now the largest military in the world with more than 2 million men and women in uniform.\n\nMore ominously for Western military observers, the parade included a first look at some of China\u2019s most dangerous weapons and drew fresh attention to the ways China is outpacing the U.S. in many technological realms.\n\nOne of the most menacing weapons on display was the DF-17 ballistic missile, a hypersonic weapon delivery system widely believed to be capable of evading virtually all current missile defenses. Hypersonic weapons travel at more than five times the speed of sound, and defense analysts widely agree that China is ahead of the U.S. in the development of such super-fast weapons.\n\nChina also rolled out a mobile DF-41 intercontinental ballistic missile, a JL-2 submarine-launched ballistic missile and a host of aircraft, land vehicles, missile interceptors and other weapons, according to media reports.\n\nWestern military analysts and Pentagon planners also got their first public views of China\u2019s new CJ-100 supersonic cruise missile, carried aboard 16 trucks in formation. Little is known officially about its capabilities, but it is believed to be an upgrade of the People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s CJ-10 cruise missile, which has an estimated range of 930 miles.\n\nParade organizers also showed off technologies such as its \u201cSharp Sword\u201d drone believed capable of attacking targets such as radar stations and military bases, as well as drone submarines that can descend far deeper than those of manned subs, The Associated Press reported.\n\nChina\u2019s state-run Xinhua News Agency singled out the DF-41 in touting the country\u2019s growing military prowess by calling the weapon the \u201cmainstay of China\u2019s strategic nuclear strength, play[ing] a vital role in strategic counterbalance, deterrence control and in winning [a] decisive victory.\u201d\n\nIn his highly anticipated speech at the event, Mr. Xi preached cooperation among nations while projecting defiance of those who would challenge China\u2019s sovereignty or exploit divisive issues such as the future of Taiwan, democracy in Hong Kong or Beijing\u2019s treatment of minority populations.\n\n\u201cNo force can stop the progress of the Chinese people,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Chinese leader cast the celebration as the culmination of 70 years of progress, a path that has finally landed the country on equal footing with its global rivals. Chinese officials note repeatedly that communist Chinese rule has surpassed the longevity of the Soviet communist rule in neighboring Russia, which collapsed with the end of the Cold War.\n\nMr. Xi also explicitly linked his reign to that of Mao Zedong, largely passing over the record of Mao\u2019s successors in reversing some of the chairman\u2019s policies and setting China on a path to massive, broad-based economic growth.\n\n\u201cSeventy years ago on this day, Comrade Mao Zedong solemnly declared here to the world that the PRC was founded and the Chinese people had stood up,\u201d he said, according to Xinhua. \u201cThis great event completely reversed China\u2019s miserable fate born from poverty and weakness and being bullied and humiliated over more than 100 years since the advent of modern times.\u201d\n\nMr. Xi also called for stability in Hong Kong, where anti-government protests turned violent Tuesday when an 18-year-old demonstrator was shot and wounded by police at point-blank range. The unrest in the semi-autonomous region partially overshadowed the anniversary events in Beijing, and some U.S. lawmakers drew a direct link between China\u2019s dangerous crackdown on protesters and its unceasing quest for military superiority.\n\n\u201cAs General Secretary Xi Jinping parades weapons through Tiananmen Square today, where democracy protesters lost their lives over 30 years ago, the party\u2019s ruthless grip tightens and expands around the globe,\u201d said Rep. Michael T. McCaul of Texas, the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \u201cThe Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is interning millions of people in concentration camps in Xinjiang and violently cracking down on democracy activists in Hong Kong \u2014 including the senseless shooting of a high schooler at point-blank range today. Their obsession with control is putting the United States, our friends and allies, and our national security at risk.\u201d\n\nLevel playing field\n\nDespite such fierce criticism from the U.S. and some of China\u2019s regional adversaries, Mr. Xi\u2019s public comments show his growing belief that the nation can compete with the U.S. militarily in the Pacific.\n\nIn fact, some of China\u2019s weapons seem designed explicitly for a conflict with the U.S. military. For the first time, the Chinese military displayed the long-range H-6N bomber, an aircraft fully capable of targeting American forces in the Pacific.\n\nBeijing also showed off its DF-26 missile, known as the \u201cGuam Killer\u201d because of its ability to easily strike U.S. forces stationed on the island.\n\nMilitary analysts say the H-6N and DF-26 \u2014 along with hypersonic arms, drones and other new weapons \u2014 are part of Beijing\u2019s broader \u201canti-access and area denial\u201d (A2AD) military strategy. Such an approach is aimed at denying an enemy the ability to occupy or move through a specific area of land, air or sea.\n\nThe strategy, analysts say, would be vital if Chinese forces mount a full-scale invasion of Taiwan and need to keep U.S. forces at bay.\n\n\u201cAdvanced supersonic drones, hypersonic glide vehicles, sophisticated air combat capability and missile systems are designed with this role in mind,\u201d Malcolm Davis, senior analyst in defense strategy and capability at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, wrote in Britain\u2019s Telegraph newspaper. \u201cThe goal is to deter and deny the U.S. and its allies \u2018access\u2019 and freedom of [movement], by striking them as far away from China as possible.\u201d\n\nThe celebrations, Mr. Davis wrote, were \u201ca warning Western states ignore at their peril.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s \u201cIndo-Pacific Strategy\u201d released this year focuses on containing Chinese expansion in the Pacific and bolstering partnerships with key regional allies such as Japan and Australia. But military officials readily acknowledge that China is growing more powerful by the day.\n\n\u201cWe take China at their word: They seek to be a world-class military by 2049, and they are making progress toward that goal,\u201d Mr. Schriver said. \u201cThey\u2019re working to become a preeminent power in the Indo-Pacific region while simultaneously undertaking plans to expand overseas presence and develop capabilities to sustain operations farther from Chinese shores.\u201d\n\nAlthough China is far from having the global reach of the U.S. military, there are real fears that its forces are the equal of the U.S. in the Pacific theater.\n\nAn August study by the University of Sydney\u2019s United States Studies Center found concluded that the Chinese military is now capable of launching attacks that could crush American defenses in a matter of hours. Defense Department officials, however, maintain that the U.S. remains able to defend itself, its territory, and its men and women in uniform around the world.\n\n\u2981 This article is based in part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
