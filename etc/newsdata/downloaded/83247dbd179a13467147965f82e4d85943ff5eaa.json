Mum swore she liked it that way, and said she couldn\u2019t think of anything worse than having to live with any man.\n\nSo either because of that, or despite it, getting married was always high on my priority list.\n\nI could see how tough it was on mum parenting my older brother and me on her own \u2013 we were both a handful, and I know we caused her massive headaches when we were teenagers. From a young age I craved a family unit that included a stable partner.\n\nSo when I met Steve* when I was 25, it wasn\u2019t long before I started fantasising setting up a life together. Steve was 10 years older than me, and had a responsible and nurturing element to his personality that I was drawn to.\n\nWant to join the family?

Source: iStock\n\nHe made me feel safe, and he made me feel like part of a team\n\nI knew I wanted to have a family with him, and when he asked me to marry him after two years of dating, I didn\u2019t even have to think before saying yes.\n\nBeing halfway between my age and my mother\u2019s, Steve got along well with Mum. He liked her and she liked him \u2013 and we often included her when we socialised. Having raised her children when she was practically still a child herself, my mum was discovering a whole new social life in her forties, and she was still incredibly attractive.\n\nSteve\u2019s friends would flirt up a storm whenever Mum came out with us. His best mate Dan* particularly used to give Mum the eye and would always tell her she looked hot, but it never occurred to me to worry. Dan had a girlfriend and he was a loyal guy.\n\nThings never got out of hand until the day of our wedding...\n\nAs luck would have it, Dan\u2019s girlfriend had broken up with him about two weeks before the wedding, and he\u2019d been absolutely gutted.\n\nWe\u2019d all been surprised \u2013 we thought they\u2019d be next to walk down the aisle. But he wasn\u2019t so sad that he couldn\u2019t put it all aside and celebrate with us on our special day.\n\nYou know how, on your wedding day, you don\u2019t leave any detail up to chance? I was like that \u2013 from ensuring the table settings didn\u2019t set off anyone\u2019s hay fever to briefing the DJ so everyone heard a song they loved.\n\nI had planned for just about everything\n\nThe one thing I didn\u2019t plan for was my mum and Dan both getting looser than I expected and pashing on at table 12.\n\nBeing a busy bride on the day, I didn\u2019t get to see what led up to the main event, but once the speeches were made, the first dance was done, and the cake was cut, the dance floor got crowded and everyone had a great time dancing and ripping into the champagne, which was flowing freely.\n\nIt was when I decided to leave the dance floor and head to the bar for a top up that my bridesmaid Emma* tried to intercept me.\n\nShe looked rattled, and I could tell something was up\n\nMy first thought was that Steve was doing something he shouldn\u2019t but I couldn\u2019t even imagine what that could be at his own wedding, so I was staggered by what I saw when I pushed past her.\n\nThere they were: Mum straddling Dan on a chair and kissing him like nobody ever wants to see their mother kissing anybody.\n\nI remember at the time being grateful that at least Mum had chosen to buck the mother-of-the-bride tradition and wore pants that day.\n\nI don\u2019t know how long I stood there, gaping with my mouth open, because it felt like time stood still (but my mother continued to writhe on Dan in a way I wish I could forget).\n\nThis isn't REALLY happening right?? Source: iStock\n\nDan spotted me first and broke things up immediately\n\nThen Mum stood up in one swift movement, smoothing her suit and shaking her head as if coming out of a daze.\n\nShe walked over and hugged me, whispering into my ear, \u201cIt\u2019s your wedding day, darling, don\u2019t make this the thing everyone remembers.\u201d\n\nEven with several champagnes under my belt, I knew she was right.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to cause a scene or make this the one memory everyone took home from the day. I\u2019d waited my whole life to be married and I wasn\u2019t going to let this ruin it.\n\nThe rest of the evening passed without incident, although I kept my mother and/or Dan in my line of sight at all times. By the end, I was so exhausted, all I could do was fall into bed and sleep off the strangest day of my life.\n\nSince that day, just over a year ago...\n\nI\u2019ve been much more careful about socialising with my mother. I told her that, even though she hadn\u2019t done anything technically wrong, I felt like she\u2019d disrespected me on my wedding day, and that was something that upset me deeply.\n\nMum was apologetic, and has sworn that what happened that day with Dan will never happen again, and I believe her. I just don\u2019t really want to be in the same room as the two of them together, feeling the vibe.\n\nFor his part, Dan has been utterly unapologetic \u2013 brazen, even.\n\nHe always asks me how my mum is with a wink and a smile, and as long as he remains single, I\u2019m determined to keep him away from her. A drunken pash at my wedding is one thing, but having my husband\u2019s best mate as my stepdad is way too weird to contemplate.", "description": "\"I don\u2019t know how long I stood there, gaping with my mouth open.\"", "authors": ["As Told To Carolyn Tate"], "top_image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/d367c93aff909006e43dac5f7d2088d2", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
