The jobless rate in August worsened to a one-year high of 5.3 percent.\n\n\"The Board took the decision to lower interest rates further today to support employment and income growth and to provide greater confidence that inflation will be consistent with the medium-term target,\" Lowe said in a short statement accompanying the rate decision.\n\n\"The economy still has spare capacity and lower interest rates will help make inroads into that.\"\n\nLowe sees a \"gentle turning point\" for the economy after annual growth hit a decade low of 1.4 percent in the quarter that ended in June.\n\nThe governor is due to speak at a business event in Melbourne later in the day, where he is expected to throw more light on future policy course.\n\nRecord low interest rates have boosted home prices, helping end two years of continuous declines which ate into household wealth and confidence in a blow to consumption and the broader economy.\n\nSome economists believe the price revival could prove a blessing for the construction sector, which has seen a severe downturn in new home approvals, particularly for the once red-hot apartment sector.\n\nBuilding approvals fell 1.1 percent in August, less than a sharp 10 percent slide in July but confounding market expectations for a bounce of 2.5 percent, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed.\n\nOne positive sign in the data was a small bounce in approvals to build new apartments while non-residential construction surged 54 percent.", "description": "The Reserve Bank of Australia signaled that it may cut rates further as unemployment is expected to rise.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/1/5e5c061ed7134378b2b42a4309b05585_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
