Starring: Awkwafina, Tzi Ma, Diana Lin, Zhao Shuzhen, Lu Hong, and Jiang Yongbo. PG cert, 100 mins\n\nThe Farewell rips your heart out of your chest. Then it hands it back to you, wrapped gently in cotton wool. Lulu Wang\u2019s second feature is a revelatory one. Bolstered by powerhouse distributor A24, known otherwise as the connoisseurs of cinematic cool, it arrives with all the fanfare accorded to a major new talent. In the US, it had a record-breaking run, earning a higher per-theatre average than Avengers: Endgame. The buzz is well-deserved. Wrapped up in all the intricacies of immigrant identity and family politics, The Farewell is a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Simply put, it\u2019s one of the best films of the year.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Wang\u2019s told this story, which is rooted deep in her own experiences. Back in 2016, on NPR\u2019s podcast This American Life, the writer-director recounted a trip to China to say goodbye to her terminally ill grandmother. Her family, however, had issued strict instructions that no one discuss the disease around her. She hadn\u2019t been told about the stage-four cancer ravaging her body. Her X-ray results were waved off as showing only \u201cbenign shadows\u201d. It\u2019s a common practice in Chinese families, since it\u2019s believed the stress of the diagnosis may only worsen a person\u2019s condition. Instead, everyone came together under the pretence that they were celebrating her grandson\u2019s wedding. Tears had to be stifled under smiles and laughter, so as not to give the game away.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWang\u2019s avatar here is Billi, a Brooklyn-based writer who\u2019s entered her thirties with no money and no prospects. She\u2019s played by Awkwafina, who up until now has been known for playing the dopey weirdo \u2013 in Crazy Rich Asians and Ocean\u2019s 8 \u2013 or rapping about \u201cqueefing like a G, b***h\u201d. In The Farewell, she strips herself down emotionally in a way that feels startling. She\u2019s a woman lost at sea, about to lose the only thing that tethered her to the past. Billi emigrated with her parents from Changchun, in northeastern China, to New York when she was six years old. She still phones her paternal grandmother (or, in Mandarin, her nai nai) on a regular basis. But when Billi\u2019s parents tell her the bad news, they also suggest she stay at home, since she\u2019s too Americanised and thus too emotionally earnest \u2013 she\u2019s bound to ruin the plan. Billi hops on a plane anyway.\n\nThe trip crushes her and rebuilds her in a thousand ways. Driving around Changchun, she\u2019s shocked by the changed skyline, as blocks of new apartments slowly eradicate every trace of her childhood. When she\u2019s finally faced with Nai Nai, her face contorts into a snapshot of combusting grief. She\u2019s trying so hard not to weep, she looks physically in pain. Her grandmother just shrugs and blames it on the jet lag. Cornering her parents, Billi demands to know why everyone seems so content to hide their grief. Her mother snaps back: if she doesn\u2019t cry, does that automatically mean she doesn\u2019t care?\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 10 best black comedy films of all time Show all 10 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. 10 best black comedy films of all time 1/10 Bad Santa (directed by Terry Zwigoff, 2003) The perfect antidote to the usual Christmas slush-fest, Bad Santa has an outrageously profane and debauched Billy Bob Thornton using his seasonal job as a shopping mall Santa Claus to rob the mall\u2019s stores. A needy child latches on to him, thawing the misanthropic alcoholic only slightly, but Zwigoff makes no compromises, and leaves no yuletide convention unscathed. One can only guess at how many unsuspecting families have had their festive celebrations scarred after innocently viewing just a smidgen of this disgusting but hilarious monument to bad taste. 2/10 Monsieur Verdoux (Charles Chaplin, 1947) Hugely controversial on release, the hostile reception garnered by Monsieur Verdoux helped precipitate Chaplin\u2019s eventual exile to Europe. The years between 1940\u2019s The Great Dictator and Chaplin\u2019s most polarising film hadn\u2019t been kind to Chaplin thanks to scandal in his private life and the increasing perception of his supposed communist sympathies. Chaplin\u2019s subsequent feelings of isolation and alienation informed this pitch black tale of a bluebeard who woos and murders a series of wealthy women so that he can support his own family. Chaplin\u2019s satirical social commentary and his character\u2019s defence that his crimes paled into insignificance in comparison with the horrors of the real world found no favour either at the box office or with critics, and the little tramp\u2019s journey from the world\u2019s most loved entertainer to public enemy number one was complete. 3/10 The Heartbreak Kid (Elaine May, 1972) Forget the wretched Ben Stiller remake and try and view a (very rare) copy of this superb comedy of embarrassment and while you\u2019re about it, go for a double header of the oft overlooked Miss May\u2019s work with 1971\u2019s A New Leaf. A Jewish boy (Charles Grodin) marries a gauche young woman in haste (Jeannie Berlin) and decides to end the marriage when he falls for and woos alluring blond goddess Cybill Shepherd whilst on honeymoon, to the uncomprehending disbelief of Shepherd\u2019s Wasp father, Eddie Albert. There are superb performances all round, with Oscar nominated Berlin (May\u2019s daughter), a stand out. In other hands the whole premise could have dissolved into bathos, but May and screenwriter Neil Simon produced a film that is wise, funny and true, and in the restaurant scene when Grodin dumps his new bride, well... heartbreaking. 4/10 Withnail and I (Bruce Robinson, 1987) A British movie that inspired a student drinking game and has its\u2019 many hilarious lines quoted verbatim by fans (\u201cDon\u2019t you threaten me with a dead fish!\u201d etc.) must have something going for it, and Withnail and I certainly does. Paul McGann and a marvellously wasted and acerbic Richard E Grant make the most of Robinson\u2019s terrific semi-autobiographical script in this hilarious tale of two base, out of work actors living in squalor who drown themselves in a diet of booze, pills and lighter fluid on a disastrous holiday in the country circa 1969. The whole movie is basically one long bender followed by the mother of all hangovers, (\u201cLook at my tongue, it\u2019s wearing a yellow sock.\u201d) and stands as a perfect farewell to the flip side of the so-called swinging Sixties. 5/10 Harold and Maude (Hal Ashby, 1971) A cult favourite dismissed and panned by critics on its\u2019 release, Harold and Maude\u2019s reputation has grown immeasurably over the years. The story revolves around the tender romance between Harold (Bud Cort), a death obsessed 20-year-old and 79-year-old Maude (Ruth Gordon), a holocaust survivor whose joie de vivre stems from that experience. Critics and cinema goers couldn\u2019t get past Harold\u2019s elaborately staged fake suicides and the love story between the pair, (If it had been a 79-year-old man and a 20-year-old woman, would there have been so much resistance?), but beneath the gallows humour lies a rather warm and moving film. Paramount Pictures 6/10 The Ladykillers (Alexander Mackendrick, 1955) Mackendrick was soon to depart for America to make the very dark Sweet Smell of Success and The Ladykillers was his final film at Ealing and a fitting swansong. Mackendrick himself viewed the film as an ironic joke about the condition of a decaying post war England and the breakdown of the old order. A gang of thieves rent a room in a sweet old lady\u2019s house (a scene stealing Katie Johnson), and masquerade as musicians while they plan and execute their latest caper. When the indomitable old lady threatens to reveal all to the police, the gang decide they have to kill her. The gang, a marvellous gallery of grotesques played by Alec Guinness, Peter Sellers, Cecil Parker, Herbert Lom, and Danny Green then have to decide who\u2019s going to do the dirty deed but only end up offing each other in a series of gruesome but highly amusing vignettes. The movie\u2019s plot supposedly arrived fully formed to screenwriter William Rose in a dream, and The Ladykillers remains one of Ealing\u2019s greatest works. 7/10 Fargo (Joel Coen, 1996) One of their finest achievements, and one of the standout films of the 1990s, Fargo put the Coen brothers in the major league, winning a best screenplay Oscar. Frances McDormand lifted the best actress award for her role as the heavily pregnant Minnesota police chief who hides a razor-sharp mind behind her congenial, homely persona. This quality allows the chief to piece together the convoluted tale of a kidnapping for ransom that goes disastrously wrong. Jarringly violent in places and with an other-worldly ambience, Fargo is shot full of the brothers\u2019 trademark dark humour and lives up to its\u2019 blurb: \u201ca lot can happen in the middle of nowhere\u201d. Chris Large 8/10 MASH (Robert Altman, 1970) MASH fully deserves its\u2019 exalted status as the landmark antiwar film of its\u2019 time or indeed of any time. Made at the height of the Vietnam War but set during the Korean War, the parallels between the two conflicts couldn\u2019t have been clearer. The audience was left in no doubt about MASH\u2019s intended targets \u2013 the horrors and absurdities of war which in real life were being beamed from Vietnam into a weary nation\u2019s living rooms, bungling military bureaucracy, the head nurse who is immune to the suffering around her, Uncle Sam, God, the whole nine yards. The outrageous practices and cruel capers perpetrated by Trapper, Hawkeye, et al on their victims, the jokes and ad libs in the operating theatre while the surgeons are covered in blood and gore, are a coping mechanism, a way of staying sane in an insane world. In other words, we laugh, lest we cry. 9/10 Kind Hearts and Coronets (Robert Hamer, 1949) Alec Guinness famously played eight roles in this very dark comedy of manners and is of course, brilliant, but he is matched all the way by a marvellously urbane and detached Dennis Price as the serial killer who calmly murders his way to a dukedom. The film takes barbed pot-shots at the aristocracy and the class divide and the talented but troubled Hamer directs with a sureness of touch that does full justice to the billboards declaring the film \u201ca hilarious study in the gentle art of murder\u201d. Price\u2019s exquisite voiceover and the savage twist in the tail are the icing on the cake in a film with no room for sentiment or remorse, the pinnacle of Ealing\u2019s wonderful body of work, and one of the greatest British films ever made. 10/10 Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (Stanley Kubrick, 1964) A deranged US general deliberately launches a nuclear bomb on the Soviet Union and the hapless American President (\u201cDimitri, we have a little problem...\u201d) has to deal with the fallout. Possibly only Kubrick would dare make a film about a nuclear attack on the USSR while the Cuban Missile Crisis was still fresh in many people\u2019s minds, but he created an instant classic in this justly famous and celebrated example of his dark art. Dr Strangelove boasts a wonderful screenplay by Kubrick and Terry Southern that aptly sums up the warped rationale of the so-called nuclear deterrent and has a uniformly brilliant cast, including Peter Sellers playing three roles. It is a film that has to be watched time and time again to marvel at how Kubrick finds humour in an unthinkably horrific situation and if anything, this devastating and timeless cold war satire has improved with age and is just as relevant today. 1/10 Bad Santa (directed by Terry Zwigoff, 2003) The perfect antidote to the usual Christmas slush-fest, Bad Santa has an outrageously profane and debauched Billy Bob Thornton using his seasonal job as a shopping mall Santa Claus to rob the mall\u2019s stores. A needy child latches on to him, thawing the misanthropic alcoholic only slightly, but Zwigoff makes no compromises, and leaves no yuletide convention unscathed.

It is a film that has to be watched time and time again to marvel at how Kubrick finds humour in an unthinkably horrific situation and if anything, this devastating and timeless cold war satire has improved with age and is just as relevant today.\n\nWhile there\u2019s been no shortage of culture-clash comedies, they\u2019ve more often than not focused on the purely superficial. Wang goes straight for the messy stuff \u2013 there\u2019s no thornier subject than death, after all. It rears its head in myriad ways, but always with the same patterns of devastation. No family goes unaffected. Billi balks at the idea of keeping Nai Nai\u2019s illness a secret, considering it\u2019d be illegal to do so in the US, but Wang gives her the space to wrestle with that impulse, and where it comes from. Her relatives see it as implicit to the selfishness of Western lifestyles. \u201cIt\u2019s our duty to carry this emotional burden for her,\u201d her uncle Haibin (Jiang Yongbo) says. Their conversations are strained by all the unspoken tension between them, but they\u2019re also a family who loves each other too much to scream and shout. When Billi finally lets it all out, it\u2019s heart-wrenching to watch.\n\nWe also get a glimpse of what it\u2019s like for Haibin, who moved to Japan several decades ago. It\u2019s a country that\u2019s geographically much closer, but still culturally distinct enough that he\u2019s made to feel like an outsider. It\u2019s his son, Hao Hao (Chen Han), who\u2019s been roped into marrying Aiko (Aoi Mizuhara), his Japanese girlfriend of three months. We never quite find out how that came about, but both bride and groom seem as bewildered as Billi. Aiko can barely speak Mandarin, so she mainly communicates in encouraging smiles and the vague sense that she might bolt out the door in a panic in any given moment.\n\nThe Farewell is one of those rare and precious comedies that is as hilarious as it is tragic. It\u2019s humanity, encompassed. Never is this more evident than when the family visit the gravesite of Nai Nai\u2019s husband. Surrounded by the wails of paid mourners, they offer a few gifts \u2013 mainly snacks and alcohol. Billi\u2019s father pulls out a cigarette, but Nai Nai insists he\u2019d quit. \u201cLet the man smoke, he\u2019s already dead. What else can happen?\u201d Haibin retorts. It\u2019s hard to tell how closely Wang is modelling these characters on her own family, but each is beautifully sketched out, regardless of how much screen time they have.\n\nAt the centre of all things, of course, is Nai Nai. She is the sun at the centre of her own solar system, and in many ways the ultimate matriarch: hustling around town, prepping for a wedding she insists can\u2019t look cheap, nagging Billi about her weight and diet, and orchestrating the many gargantuan family dinners. Billi might be experiencing the worst cultural whiplash of her life \u2013 something Wang pointedly never offers a solution to \u2013 but it\u2019s her love for this formidable woman that always manages to pull her through.", "description": "Dir: Lulu Wang.
