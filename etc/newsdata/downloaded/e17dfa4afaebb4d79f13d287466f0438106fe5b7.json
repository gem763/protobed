Also included are the Cadillac Escalade from 2015 to 2017, and the GMC Yukon and Chevy Suburban and Tahoe from 2015 through 2018.\n\nGM says a pump in the power-assist brakes can put out less vacuum power than needed, increasing stopping distance and the risk of a crash.\n\nThe recall comes after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating in November of last year.\n\nDealers will recalibrate the electronic brake control module. Owners were to be notified starting September 6.\n\nIt was not immediately clear on Wednesday how many injuries or crashes are linked to the issue. However, GM said it could impact braking in \"rare circumstances,\" according to Reuters.", "description": "Six different models issued between 2014 to 2018 have a braking issue that can increase the risk of a crash", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/11/d41c22ef-dab4-4263-a09a-f04e7b8f8bca/thumbnail/1200x630/3e23c9c6f73553188a84e16400607160/chevy-2019-09-11t121244z-1897442952-rc1d4a86ab70-rtrmadp-3-gm-recall.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
