Josep Antoni Pozanco, Barcelona's physical trainer, admitted: 'Pre-season at Barca is a little different to other clubs. Here, we work with the ball from the very first day and nothing motivates the players more than having their ball at the feet.'\n\nAnd the Nou Camp outfit firmly stick by their roots from the off, taking part in the famous Rondo drill - which was first introduced to the club by Barcelona legend and former manager Johan Cruyff.\n\nGroundbreaking GPS also plays a pivotal role for Barcelona to help the players improve\n\nBarca claim GPS helps them to adapt to each player's training to meet their individual needs\n\nArturo Vidal shares a laugh in the changing rooms during pre-season with the Spanish giants\n\nWith the Rondo an everyday exercise at Barca, it comes as no surprise why many clubs in world football try to emulate them. 'With these drills we keep them on side!', Pozanco goes on to admit. Respect is earned with the ball.\n\nFollowing an hour-and-a-half in the intense Spanish heat, nutrition becomes key. And the insightful footage describes how they rehydrate by getting a smoothie on board, choosing their drink 'by colour rather than flavour'.\n\nNutritionist Tona Lizarraga admitted: 'With smoothies, similarly to children, the players tend to choose by colour rather than the flavour but we give them all kinds of combinations of ingredients, vitamins and antioxidants which produce wonderfully tasty results and the players really enjoy them.'\n\n'Green is always a favourite choice, with celery, spinach, green apple, pear and lemon. It sounds a bit unpleasant but it's delicious', site manager Marta Miguel added.\n\nOff the pitch, the club's planning is very meticulous and their groundbreaking GPS technology comes to the fore to show the players just how they need to improve prior to their bid for even more silverware.\n\n'We have two fitness coaches who spend hours looking at GPS data to report to me. I then share this with the medical staff to keep them informed and help to prevent injuries', Pozanco added.\n\nThe players take part in exercises to help form and tighten the bonds ahead of the new season\n\nThe video highlighted just how strong the spirit is within the Barcelona changing room\n\nBarcelona defenders Jordi Alba and Gerard Pique share a joke during a unique exercise\n\n'Ultimately, if you don't adapt to technology, you get left behind, for sure'.\n\nGPS trainer Edu Pons added: 'And there's more and more. It's information that eight or 10 years ago, you did by intuition but this technology really shows you how the player is performing, and it helps us to adapt to each player's training to meet their individual needs.'\n\nAfter recuperating - with the right nutrition and taking their GPS details on board - they are back at it once again for the second session of the day, which helps the players tackle the workload of the demanding number of matches in the fast-approaching season.\n\nWith Barcelona having a clear footballing philosophy, it comes as no surprise that they put the player and the ball at the absolute centre.\n\nEvery moment of pure skill from Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez, Ousmane Dembele and Co is the result of huge effort behind the scenes and the brand new footage highlights exactly why they continue to be one of the most dominant forces in football.", "description": "While Barcelona's tiki-taka football steal\u00a0the headlines, the work done behind the scenes certainly can't be underestimated and highlight why they are every player's dream club.", "authors": ["Jonathan Spencer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/26/09/18954824-0-image-a-10_1569485833731.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
