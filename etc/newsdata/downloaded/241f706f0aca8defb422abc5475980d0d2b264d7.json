Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.), the bill's sponsor, said the new tax would help decrease use of vaping products, particularly among teens and young adults.\n\n\u201cA whole generation of our children are getting addicted to nicotine\u201d through the use of vaping products, Suozzi said at Wednesday's markup. \u201cFor young people especially, who have less money and therefore higher price elasticity, taxes on vaping products are an effective way to decrease usage.\"\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this month said the median age of patients affected by the vaping illness is 23, and 79 percent of the patients are under the age of 35.\n\nTom Barthold, chief of staff for the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), told lawmakers that the proposed tax would lead to a projected 22 percent annual reduction in use of the affected vaping products.\n\nThe bill would extend the federal tax on nicotine in cigarettes to nicotine in vaping products, raising about $10 billion over a decade, according to the JCT.\n\nSeveral GOP members voiced concerns that the bill would not impose a tax on vaping products with THC, the main psychoactive compound in marijuana, despite the CDC\u2019s findings of a greater correlation between THC vaping products and the illnesses than with nicotine vaping products.\n\nRep.
