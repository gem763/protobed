I installed Android 10 on my original Pixel XL late yesterday (yes, I\u2019ve still got the first version of the Pixel \u2014 so sue me), and except for a few stylistic changes, the new features weren\u2019t immediately obvious.\n\nYou can find them easily enough, though, if you know where to look.\n\nInstalling Android 10\n\nFirst, of course, you have to make sure you have the new OS installed. If you haven\u2019t gotten a notification, it\u2019s easy enough to find:\n\nOpen your phone\u2019s settings\n\nSelect System > Advanced > System update\n\n(Note: Before installing a new OS, it\u2019s always a good idea to make sure that your phone is backed up, just in case. Google has a feature that automatically backs up your phone; go to Setup and select System > Backup. If it says On under Backup, you should be fine; you can tap on Backup to see what\u2019s being backed up and when it last happened.)\n\nIt took my phone about half an hour or so to install the new OS and update the apps; your mileage may vary.\n\nSo now that you\u2019ve got the new OS, here are some tricks to try.\n\nGestures\n\nFor several generations of Android, you\u2019ve navigated by using the three symbols at the bottom of the screen including Back, Home, and the Recent task-switching button. Google has now replaced that format with a gesture system, similar to that used by recent iPhones.\n\nIf you\u2019re the kind of person who is resistant to change, don\u2019t panic: Google has made the use of these gestures optional. In fact, when my phone updated to Android 10, the old symbols were still there.\n\nNo matter your initial opinion of gestures, it couldn\u2019t hurt to give them a try. Here\u2019s how to turn gestures on:\n\nGo to Settings > System > Gestures > 3-button navigation\n\nFrom the three choices on the page, select \u201cGesture navigation.\u201d There is a GIF at the top of the page to illustrate the various gestures you need to make; there is also a quick rundown of how to use them in our review.\n\nThere\u2019s a settings cog to the right of \u201cGesture navigation,\u201d which lets you set the sensitivity of the screen when you back-swipe. You probably want to leave that setting alone until you\u2019ve played with gestures for a while.\n\nNow, instead of the three icons, all you\u2019ll see at the bottom of your screen will be a black strip with a white dash in the center. (Or vice versa, depending on the page\u2019s background color.) Of course, if you finally decide you\u2019re not a gesture person, you can go back and return your phone to its old format.\n\nDark mode\n\nDark mode is very popular these days. It\u2019s supposed to help keep your battery going longer (having not tested it, I can\u2019t say one way or the other), but I find it very useful when I\u2019m using my phone at night. While many Android apps have, over the years, provided their own dark modes, Android now has a universal dark theme. To turn it on:\n\nGo to Settings > Display\n\nToggle on \u201cDark theme.\u201d You\u2019ll get a pop-up that lets you know that supported apps will also switch to the dark theme.\n\nIf you look in your quick settings menu (the one you get when you swipe down from the top), you can also access a dark mode toggle there. If you don\u2019t immediately see the icon, click on the pencil icon in the lower left corner of the quick settings drop-down.\n\nAs mentioned in our review, it would be a lot nicer if there was a way to have the phone change to dark mode automatically at sunset. Maybe in a future iteration.\n\nFocus Mode\n\nYes, I am easily distracted. For example, while writing this article, I found myself clicking on an article I found in my Google drawer, and had to force myself to remember that I had work to do. So Focus Mode \u2014 which was created to help minimize distractions by pausing specific apps \u2014 may prove very useful, at least in my case.\n\nBefore I describe how to find Focus Mode, a note: To be able to use it, you have to be part of the Digital Wellbeing beta program. If you don\u2019t see Focus Mode in your Digital Wellbeing app, then simply sign up for the beta, and wait for the app to be updated with the beta version; it should take only a few minutes.\n\nReady?\n\nGo to Settings > \u201cDigital Wellbeing & parental controls\u201d\n\nScroll down to \u201cWays to Disconnect\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve got three choices here to help you manage your distraction level. Tap on each to set it up.\n\nDashboard lets you set timers for specific apps so that they will pause if you go past your allotted time.\n\nWind Down lets you avoid interruptions at night; you can use Night Light to tint the screen for dim lighting, have the app remind you that it\u2019s time for bed by gray-scaling your screen, and put the Do Not Disturb mode in place, among other features.\n\nFocus Mode (mentioned above) lets you immediately pause apps such as Facebook or Twitter so that you can concentrate on the task at hand.\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with Dark mode, you can also find Focus Mode on your quick settings menu.\n\nLocation permissions\n\nA lot of apps ask for permission to track your location. In Android 10, you can now set that permission so that the app can only track your location while it is in use rather than all the time. To find which of your current apps have permission to track your location, and to change their permissions:\n\nGo to Settings\n\nGo to Apps & notifications > Permission manager > Location\n\nYou\u2019ll get a list of all the apps that have permission to track your phone\u2019s location, followed by all those allowed to track you only while they are in use, and then by those that have been denied the right to track your location. Tap on each app\u2019s name to change its permission to \u201cAllow all the time,\u201d \u201cAllow only while using the app,\u201d or \u201cDeny.\u201d\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\nA new category in settings: Privacy\n\nBy the way, you can find the Permission manager in another place now as well: the new category of Privacy in your settings listing. You can also find your \u201cShow passwords\u201d toggle here (so you can see passwords as you type them), your notification controls for your lock screen, your autofill manager for forms, and several other privacy features.\n\nThere are, of course, a number of other new features that will simply pop up as you need them \u2014 for example, more details on some notifications. And one very interesting new feature, Live Caption, is not yet available; it should offer closed captioning for all audio and video on the phone. As with all newly released operating systems, Android 10 is a work in progress. The features described here are probably only the beginning.", "description": "If you\u2019ve got a Pixel, chances are that you\u2019ve got, or are about to get, the latest version of Android 10, which has a bunch of interesting new features that are worth checking out.
