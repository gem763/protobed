(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on U.S. reaction to Turkey's offensive into Syria (all times local):\n\n8:30 p.m.\n\nU.S. officials say an American outpost in northeastern Syria has been vacated after coming under fire from Turkish artillery.\n\nThe officials say a number of U.S. troops left their post on a hill outside the town of Kobane after it came under fire. The officials say a large base in the town has not been affected by the shelling.\n\nTurkey says it didn't target the U.S. outpost but was responding to fire from Kurdish groups nearby.\n\nThe officials say they expect the evacuation to be temporary.\n\n\u2014 Sarah El Deeb and Lolita C. Baldor\n\n__\n\n8 p.m.\n\nThe Pentagon says U.S. troops in Syria came under artillery fire from the Turks on Friday, in an area where Turkey knows Americans are present.\n\nNavy Capt. Brook DeWalt, a Pentagon spokesman, says the artillery explosion came within a few hundred meters of the area where U.S. troops were.\n\nHe says no troops were injured and U.S. forces have not withdrawn from Kobani.\n\nTurkey says the U.S. was not the target.\n\nDeWalt warns that Turkey must avoid actions that could result in immediate defensive action by the U.S.\n\nThis is the first time a coalition base has been in the line of fire since Turkey's offensive into Syria began Wednesday.\n\n__\n\n1 p.m.\n\nTop Pentagon officials are denying the U.S. is abandoning its Syrian Kurdish allies in the face of a Turkish military offensive, although the future of a counterterrorism partnership with the Kurds is in grave doubt.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper says, \"We have not abandoned the Kurds.\"\n\nHe adds that the U.S. \"pushed back very hard at all levels for the Turks not to commence this operation.\"\n\nEsper's remarks appear aimed at strengthening the Trump administration's argument that it did all it could to stop the Turks and, failing that, was left with no reasonable option but to pull some U.S. troops away from the border.", "description": "U.S. officials say an American outpost in northeastern Syria has been vacated after coming under fire from Turkish artillery.
