This seems to me to be an awful reason and I worry whether it will happen to anyone else.\n\n\u2018We don\u2019t know if it is Polish or eastern Europeans that are at risk or is it English people too?\n\n\u2018I just hope the Polish community are not being targeted as we pay our taxes and contribute to the community and love being here.\u2019\n\nBartoline has been contacted for comment.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
