The S&P 500 Value Index has returned about 5% since the start of August compared with the 0.9% for the S&P 500 Growth Index.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that the winds of change are upon us,\u201d Wilson wrote in a report Sunday. \u201cThe long-overdue adjustment process for the most expensive secular growth stocks is under way and will likely continue until valuations become so cheap that they discount a more achievable outcome on growth and profitability and/or the risk of economic recession and lower capex subsides. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet on either score.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a debate that\u2019s captivated stock pickers for years and is dividing Wall Street. Unless the economic outlook changes materially, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said this month they prefer growth over value, commonly defined as those trading cheap to fundamentals.\n\nWhile the S&P 500 Index approached a record high on Friday, some growth shares have been underperforming, and Morgan Stanley highlighted software companies in particular. The S&P North American Expanded Technology Software Index is down 7.7% from its record reached on July 26. The gauge has surged 97% since the end of 2016 -- more than double the S&P 500.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Adam Haigh in Sydney at ahaigh1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Christopher Anstey at canstey@bloomberg.net, Andreea Papuc\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Lagging returns from U.S. growth stocks, recently surpassed by their value peers, mark only the start of a longer-term move, according to Morgan Stanley.The shift favors an overweight position in financials, consumer staples and utilities, said Michael Wilson, the bank\u2019s chief U.S. equity", "authors": ["Adam Haigh"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ELJfIt1w3Ps4xRjLdzjzaQ--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/0f1ca1641ba896e90ddfbc6c9e1e71c1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
