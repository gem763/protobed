But as the trend for exporting pork to China continues at this rate, the bacon excess may stabilize, per Bloomberg.\n\nFollow Joshua Bote on Twitter: @joshua_bote", "description": "Data released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows that the amount of pork belly stored in warehouses reached a near-record high.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b2b05a4ab25f4fca0316459e1c7404c537a89702/c=0-0-1365-768/local/-/media/2019/09/10/USATODAY/usatsports/imageforentry12-fwv.jpg?width=1365&height=768&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
