Thankfully we don't have another major for a while, but I think the only thing that could come close to doing what I did in Portrush would be a green jacket.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

So I don't see myself trying to peak for majors.\n\n\"I just see myself picking out my schedule and going out and trying to compete in as many tournaments as I can and try and win as many tournaments as I can, and if it somehow happens to be the week of a major, all well and good and I'll take it from there.\"\n\nAsked which of the majors represents his best chance of more success, Lowry added: \"My record is probably best in US Opens, so I think I could do all right in those. I've not got a great record around Augusta. I've always struggled with my driving for some reason and I shouldn't, really.\n\n\"If I'm playing good, it doesn't matter what course I'm on. I think over the years I've played every type of golf course well.\n\n\"To win majors you need to be holing those six-footers for par and you need to be getting out of trouble when you're in trouble and you need to have your full A game mentally and physically to win them.\n\n\"Hopefully at some stage over the next 10 or 15 years I'll put myself in the position a few times and maybe win another one.\"\n\nPA", "description": "Shane\u00a0Lowry\u00a0believes the only thing which could come close to topping his Open\u00a0triumph would be winning the Masters.
