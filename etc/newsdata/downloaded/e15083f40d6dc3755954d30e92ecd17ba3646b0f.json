I ended up starting that game and then what was probably quite a challenging couple of weeks finished on a real good note as my parents got to watch me play and I got my first cap. It all worked out in the end.\"\n\nJust as strikers in football are judged, sometimes unfairly, mainly on the number of goals they score so it is with rugby wing and their tries.\n\nMay failed to score in his first seven Tests before ending that frustrating run in style with a superb effort in an agonising 24-21 loss to world champions New Zealand at Twickenham in 2014.\n\nIn and out of the side on form grounds early in his England career, May's progress was also hampered by a severe knee injury.\n\nBut he heads into this weekend's knockout clash with an excellent record of 25 tries in 49 Tests.\n\n\"If you take a step back, you'd say it's an awesome achievement, something I'm very proud of and hopefully I've made my family proud,\" May said.\n\n\"Every time I've played for England it's been an honour. To do it 50 times is a great achievement.\"\n\nMay, however, was adamant that now was not the occasion for reflection.\n\n\"It's no time to take a step back at the moment, it's a huge team game at the weekend.\n\n\"I'll just be focusing on how I can contribute to that team performance as best I can and prepare and play no different to how I do every week.\"", "description": "England wing Jonny May credits a night away from the beer for fizzing up his career, as he prepares to win his 50th cap in Saturday's Rugby World Cup quarter-finals.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9482/026577f662d64b36ab5a7bfc8a9a950c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
