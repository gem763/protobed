Many people assume that filling out the form would be a waste of time. Maybe they believe it's time-consuming, and they're not sure if they would qualify for aid anyway.\n\nBut this one (free) form can determine a student's eligibility for myriad grants and aid for all income levels. Also, the information you report determines eligibility for federal subsidized and unsubsidized loans, which can be very affordable alternatives to other types of loans. We attempt to demystify some areas of the FAFSA and explain some changes aimed at facilitating the process.", "description": "The FAFSA for the 2019-20 school year is now available.
