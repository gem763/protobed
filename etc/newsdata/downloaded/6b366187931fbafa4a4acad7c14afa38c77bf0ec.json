We\u2019ve had straightforward qualifying games that haven\u2019t challenged us.\n\n\u201c(This) was a proper test and we didn\u2019t come through, so it would be naive not to take the lessons from what we\u2019ve seen on the pitch.\u201d\n\nSouthgate is \u201cunder no illusions as to where we stand\u201d and wants a positive response from his players in Monday\u2019s trip to Bulgaria.\n\nEngland will qualify for Euro 2020 with a win in Sofia should Kosovo fail to beat Montenegro, but the loss in the Czech Republic will hurt \u2013 and perhaps provides a timely reality check as excitement builds ahead of playing much of Euro 2020 on home soil.\n\n\u201cLook, it\u2019s not for me to tell the public not to dream and not to have hope,\u201d Southgate said.\n\n\u201cI think internally, we have to be different and be realistic and we haven\u2019t changed our tone on that at all.\n\n\u201cWe know our strengths and we know the areas we have to improve upon. We\u2019ve talked about it throughout the week and we\u2019ve had evidence of it (against the Czech Republic)\n\n\u201cSo, I don\u2019t think any of us within the camp are under any illusions.\n\n\u201cTo be a really top team, with players with experience of winning the biggest matches, we\u2019re still some way from that.\n\n\u201cBut we found a way to progress through the World Cup with what was a relatively inexperienced team and that\u2019s what we\u2019re always trying to do: to find solutions to bring some good players through.\n\n\u201cThe reality of football is you\u2019re not going to cruise through a qualifying campaign like we have unless you\u2019re a super experienced team who have a constant high level of performance.\n\n\u201cSo, (this) isn\u2019t a night you want to be involved with because of the record there\u2019s been, and you never want to lose matches as an England manager, but it\u2019s something that will galvanise us and make sure that we look for a response on Monday and moving forwards.\u201d", "description": "Gareth Southgate is considering returning to the three-man backline that served England so well at the World Cup in a bid to shore up their leaky defence.
