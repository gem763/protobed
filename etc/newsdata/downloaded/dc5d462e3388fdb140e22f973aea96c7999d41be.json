(AP) - Philip Rivers and the Los Angeles Chargers thought they scored the go-ahead touchdown not once, but twice inside the final minute against the Tennessee Titans.\n\nYet again, the Chargers found a way to stop themselves near the goal line in a 23-20 loss Sunday.\n\nAfter the replay official ruled Austin Ekeler had been stopped a yard outside the goal line off a pass from Rivers, the Chargers thought Melvin Gordon scored on a 1-yard run that was overturned again for being short of the goal line. Then, Gordon fumbled with the Titans recovering, giving the Chargers a league-high five turnovers inside the red zone this season.\n\n\u201cIt was crazy,\u201d said Gordon, who fumbled in his third game back from a holdout for a new contract. \u201cYou feel like you won, and then slow motion shows your knee down before you passed (the goal line). I thought I got in, but obviously it showed that I was short, and we thought that (Ekeler) got in, but he was short. It\u2019s just unfortunate.\u201d\n\nThe Chargers (2-5) have lost three straight and five of their last six, and turnovers in crucial moments near the goal line cost them in a 13-10 loss to Detroit in Week 2 and again against Tennessee. The Chargers have three fumbles, and Rivers has been intercepted twice in the end zone on throws from the 7 and the 2.\n\nThey also have had at least seven TDs nullified due to either penalty or replay.\n\nRivers said their issues with turnovers near the goal line are crazy.\n\n\u201cThe fourth down before the half against Denver. The third-and-goal against Denver on the 2 where I threw the interception,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cThe fumble in Detroit. The fumble right here? Did I leave one out? Pretty big consequences with those. The two in Denver is 14 points. The one in Detroit, we\u2019re only down three right? And then today.\n\n\u201cSo those are three wins if we handled our business down there.\u201d\n\nRivers nearly rallied the Chargers from a 23-13 deficit with 6:39 left, and he thought he had thrown his third touchdown pass of the game on a 16-yarder only to see the replay official rule Ekeler had been stopped a yard outside the end zone. Rivers still finished with a 108.3 passer rating, becoming only the fifth player in NFL history with 100 career games with a passer rating of 100 or higher.\n\nHe also passed a pair of fellow 2004 draft picks in career passing yards during the second quarter. Rivers needed only 105 yards to pass Eli Manning (56,537) and Ben Roethlisberger (56,545), and he had 77 by the end of the first quarter and 158 by halftime to keep climbing that list. He finished by throwing for 329 yards and two TDs.\n\nEkeler thought he had his second TD after scoring on a 41-yarder with 5:09 left. He finished with seven catches for 118 yards.\n\n\u201cI looked at the replay and was like, \u2018It\u2019s probably going to stand,\u2019\u201d Ekeler said. \u201cBut that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d\n\nAfter Ekeler was ruled down shy of the end zone, the Chargers had a false start on the next snap. Then, Rivers threw to Mike Williams in the end zone, drawing a pass interference penalty on Titans cornerback Malcolm Butler. Gordon ran twice, only to be stopped and then stripped of the ball.\n\nGordon fumbled twice, losing the second. He ran 16 times for 32 yards with nothing going longer than 6 yards.\n\nChargers coach Anthony Lynn said he\u2019d never been in a ballgame like this before with the roller-coaster of emotions at the end. The Chargers, missing three starting defensive linemen, stopped the Titans on fourth-and-inches near midfield with 2:35 left to set Rivers up for what would\u2019ve been a big comeback.\n\n\u201cAt the end, we needed 1 yard to win this game, and we didn\u2019t get it,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get 1 yard, then you don\u2019t deserve to win the damn game. That\u2019s just the way it is. We needed 1 yard to win this game, and we let it slip out of our hands. I am at a loss for words right now.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Teresa M.
