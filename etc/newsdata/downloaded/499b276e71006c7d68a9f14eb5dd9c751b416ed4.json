Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) discussed Middle East policy and claimed Sunday during the liberal \u201cpro-Israel, pro-peace\u201d J Street conference that President Donald Trump has not made America or Israel \u201csafer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we want the status quo. We want to get a two-state solution. We want peace. There should be a way to get there,\u201d Klobuchar told the group, which supports a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \u201cTime and time again, it\u2019s held up.\u201d\n\nAsked about the Iran nuclear deal Trump withdrew from and the withholding of aid to place pressure on the Israeli government to act, Klobuchar said, \u201cIt\u2019s very important that we don\u2019t negotiate onstage.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to commit right now to what that pressure is,\u201d she added, before continuing to take aim at President Trump.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s made America safer. He certainly hasn\u2019t made Israel safer,\u201d Klobuchar said in regards to negotiating in a world stage.\n\nLast week, Klobuchar and her campaign announced that she had qualified for the Democrat presidential primary debate in November.\n\n\u201cWe just qualified for the November Democratic debate,\u201d Klobuchar wrote at the time. \u201cThanks to everyone for working so hard, making a small donation, and helping us grow our momentum.\u201d", "description": "Amy Klobuchar claimed Sunday during the J Street conference that President Donald Trump has not made America or Israel \"safer.\"", "authors": ["Kyle Morris"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Klobuchar-Disses-Trump-to-J-Street-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
