We need vigilance, determination and patience.\"\n\nEarlier this week, several senior EU figures played down the chances of Brexit happening with a deal agreed to by both sides.\n\nBut on Thursday, Mr Johnson and Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar held a one-to-one discussion - described by both as \"very positive and very promising\".\n\nMr Varadkar said talks were at a \"very sensitive stage\" but he was now \"convinced\" the UK wanted a deal, adding: \"I do see a pathway towards an agreement in the coming weeks.\"\n\nWith less than three weeks to go until the Brexit deadline, Mr Johnson continues to insist the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal at the end of the month.\n\nThat is despite the so-called Benn Act - passed by MPs last month - demanding he request a delay to the Article 50 deadline from the EU until January 2020 if a deal has not been agreed before 19 October.\n\nShould any new deal be reached between the EU and UK, it will still have to be approved by MPs in Parliament.", "description": "EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier calls for \"patience\" ahead of a crucial Brussels summit next week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16269/production/_109192709_mediaitem109192708.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
