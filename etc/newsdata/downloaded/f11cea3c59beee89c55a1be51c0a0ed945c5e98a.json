Proceeds from the sale will be used to support the museum collection.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Bacon (1909-1992) made long visits to Tangier, Morocco, where his lover Peter Lacy had moved. Bacon was particularly prolific while there, but he ultimately destroyed the majority of the paintings he created, according to Sotheby\u2019s.\n\n\u201cPope offers an exceedingly rare glimpse into Francis Bacon\u2019s psychological state during a prolific but ultimately tortured time in his life and career,\u201d Gr\u00e9goire Billault, head of Sotheby\u2019s contemporary art department in New York and former researcher for The Estate of Francis Bacon, said in a statement.\n\nWhile Tangier represented the artist\u2019s first travels outside of Europe, and the promise of an open life with Lacy, their relationship proved volatile and violent, \u201cwhich found expression in Bacon\u2019s anguished Popes of the period\u2014of which precious few survive,\u201d Billault said.\n\nThe painting offered for sale was gifted to the Brooklyn Museum by Olga H. Knoepke, an American collector and a pioneering businesswoman. She purchased it in 1967 from the legendary Swiss dealer Jan Krugier, who himself acquired the painting from Bacon\u2019s friend Nicolas Brusilowski, according to Sotheby\u2019s.\n\nThe painting will be available for public viewing at Sotheby\u2019s New York galleries starting Nov. 1.\n\nPreviously, only two of the six surviving Tangier Paintings have ever appeared at auction. The most recent\u2014another Pope\u2014was sold at Sotheby\u2019s Paris for $7.3 million in 2008. A small head-and-shoulders portrait of Bacon\u2019s Screaming Pope from the collection of Richard E. Lang and Jane Lang Davis fetched $50.4 million in Sotheby\u2019s evening sale of contemporary art earlier this year in May.", "description": "The rare painting could fetch up to $8 million", "authors": ["Fang Block"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-116863/social", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
