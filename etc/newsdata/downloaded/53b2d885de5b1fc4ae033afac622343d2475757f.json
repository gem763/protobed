(Image: AP)\n\nA report compiled by an independent group of experts claims that governments and NGOs are woefully unprepared for the next big pandemic, while subsequently warning of a \u201cvery real threat\u201d for a global-scale pandemic to kill 50 million to 80 million people.\n\n\u201cThe world is at acute risk for devastating regional or global disease epidemics or pandemics that not only cause loss of life but upend economies and create social chaos,\u201d grimly proclaims the report, published Thursday by the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board (GPMB).\n\nThe independent group, co-convened by the World Health Organisation and the World Bank, warns that the world is increasingly facing an array of dire health risks and that preparedness efforts at the state-level are sorely lacking.\n\nThe GPMB was formed in response to recommendations made by a United Nations crisis task force following the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. Launched in 2018, the group monitors and evaluates global levels of preparedness for disease outbreaks and other health-related crises.\n\nIn addition to flagging potential problems and deficiencies, the GPMB provides recommendations to national and international leaders and other decision-makers. Today\u2019s report, called \u201cWorld at Risk,\u201d is the first in what\u2019s expected to be an annual series.\n\nFor the report, the GPMB experts evaluated emerging social, economic and political trends, as well as the latest developments in how highly infectious diseases migrate around the world, among many other factors. Citing global trends like climate change and burgeoning international insecurity, the authors of the new report warned of the potential for major disease outbreaks.\n\n\u201cCountries, donors and multilateral institutions must be prepared for the worst.\u201d\n\nIn the introduction of the report, written by GPMB co-chairs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the former Prime Minister of Norway, and Elhadj As Sy, the secretary-general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the authors put their concern in the bleakest of terms.\n\nA \u201cglobal health emergency looms large,\u201d they wrote, including \u201ca very real threat of a rapidly moving, highly lethal pandemic of a respiratory pathogen killing 50 to 80 million people and wiping out nearly 5% of the world\u2019s economy,\u201d wrote Brundtland and Sy. A \u201cglobal pandemic on that scale would be catastrophic, creating widespread havoc, instability and insecurity,\u201d they wrote, adding that the \u201cworld is not prepared.\u201d\n\nThe current level of preparedness at the global scale was described in the report as being \u201cgrossly insufficient.\u201d Community engagement, the authors wrote, is \u201cfundamentally lacking\u201d across \u201call aspects of national preparedness planning and response.\u201d Ebola, SARS, cholera, measles, and influenza were among the many dangerous airborne diseases cited by the group.\n\nGlobal examples of emerging and re-emerging diseases. By \u201cdeliberately emerging,\u201d the authors are referring to a deliberate release of dangerous pathogens. (Image: GPMB)\n\nThe group also expressed its frustration at the inability of governments and their partners to develop coherent, long-term approaches to the problem.\n\n\u201cFor too long, we have allowed a cycle of panic and neglect when it comes to pandemics: we ramp up efforts when there is a serious threat, then quickly forget about them when the threat subsides,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cIt is well past time to act.\u201d\n\nAll economies are vulnerable, but the poor suffer the most, according to the report. The authors said lower-resource communities tend to lack basic health services, clean water, and sanitation \u2014 factors that exacerbate the spread of infectious diseases. Other drivers of disease cited in the new report included the surge in international conflicts, the rise of weak states, increasing migration, the climate crisis, and urbanisation.\n\nPredicted country vulnerability to pandemic in terms of economic loss, 2018 (% GDP loss). (Image: GPMB)\n\nPrediction models suggest a global pandemic would drop South Asia\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) by 2 per cent, equal to $78 billion, and drop Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s GDP by 1.7 per cent, or $41 billion, according to the report. That\u2019s a lot of money, by any measure.\n\n\u201cAny country without basic primary health care, public health services, health infrastructure and effective infection control mechanisms faces the greatest losses, including death, displacement and economic devastation,\u201d the authors wrote in the report.\n\nThe report listed several \u201curgent actions\u201d to prepare the world for major health emergencies. These include a commitment by heads of government to \u201ccommit and invest\u201d in the development of strong systems to deal with outbreaks and a plea to financial institutions to \u201clink preparedness with financial risk planning.\u201d \u201cCountries, donors and multilateral institutions,\u201d the authors wrote, \u201cmust be prepared for the worst.\u201d\n\nSome progress in this area has been made, including 59 countries that, as of July 2019, have developed a national action plan for health security \u2014 yet not a single one is fully financed, according to the report. Accordingly, the GPMB is calling for increased funding at the local, national, and international levels.\n\nNo doubt, this is a compelling and sobering report, but it\u2019s an open question as to whether the world is listening, especially given the myriad concerns that seem more pressing at the moment. Sadly, the cycle of ramping up the required systems and resources when an epidemic hits, and then scaling down again when it\u2019s over, will remain the de facto approach for the foreseeable future.", "description": "A report compiled by an independent group of experts claims that governments and NGOs are woefully unprepared for the next big pandemic, while subsequently warning of a \u201cvery real threat\u201d for a global-scale pandemic to kill 50 million to 80 million people....", "authors": ["Ryan F.
