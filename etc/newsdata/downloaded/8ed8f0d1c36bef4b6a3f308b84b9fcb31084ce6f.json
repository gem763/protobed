A couple of counties kept their power until after midnight.\n\nThe blackouts impact a half-million people \u2014 or nearly 180,000 customers \u2014 in 15 counties, and PG&E warned that a second round of outages could occur over the weekend when winds return to the region.\n\nIn the south, where hot, dry Santa Ana winds were expected to hit Thursday, Southern California Edison warned that it might black out about 308,000 customers \u2014 perhaps 750,000 people \u2014 depending on the forecast.\n\nSan Diego Gas & Electric warned of power shutoffs to about 24,000 customers.\n\nThe utilities have said the precautionary blackouts are designed to keep winds that could gust to 60 mph (97 kph) or more from knocking branches into power lines or toppling them, sparking wildfires.\n\nElectrical equipment was blamed for setting several fires in recent years that killed scores of people and burned thousands of homes.\n\n\u201cWe understand the hardship caused by these shutoffs,\u201d PG&E CEO Bill Johnson said Wednesday. \u201cBut we also understand the heartbreak and devastation caused by catastrophic wildfires.\u201d\n\nThe latest outage comes two weeks after PG&E shut down the power for several days to about 2 million people in northern and central California.\n\nThe current outages will last about 48 hours, the utility said. But its seven-day forecast shows a likelihood of another planned blackout across a much larger area. The timing wasn\u2019t clear but it could start as early as Saturday, when even heavier winds are expected to move through.\n\n\u201cThis could be the strongest wind event of the season, unfortunately,\u201d PG&E meteorologist Scott Strenfel said.\n\nStrenfel called the current wind event a \u201cCalifornia-wide phenomenon.\u201d Conditions should begin easing in the northern part of the state around midday Thursday, when crews will begin inspecting lines to make sure they\u2019re safe to re-energize.\n\nThat\u2019s when Santa Ana winds were expected to begin whipping up in the south.\n\nThe small city of Calistoga, in the Napa Valley, known for its hot springs and wineries, was among those hit by Wednesday\u2019s outage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating,\u201d said Michael Dunsford, owner of the 18-room Calistoga Inn, which has rented two powerful generators for the month at a cost of $5,000. Like many, he felt the outages need to be better managed, better targeted and less expansive.\n\n\u201cRight now, we have no wind. Zero. I don\u2019t even see a single leaf blowing. Did they really have to cut the power right now?\u201d he said, shortly after the lights went out Wednesday afternoon and he revved up the generators. \u201cWhen the wind picks up to 40 mph maybe that\u2019s a good time to close the power.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not appreciating enough the impact this has on everybody,\u201d he said about PG&E.\n\nSome of the frustration was being taken out on PG&E employees, the company\u2019s CEO said.\n\nJohnson said Wednesday that a PG&E employee was the target of what appeared to be a deliberate attack in Glenn County. He said a projectile that may have come from a pellet gun hit the employee\u2019s front window. The employee wasn\u2019t hurt.\n\n\u201cThere is no justification for this sort of violence,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWherever you see crews they are there to help you.\u201d\n\nMandatory evacuations were prompted east of Geyserville after a wildfire sparked in northeastern Sonoma County along the Lake County line late Wednesday.\n\nThe Press Democrat reports that according to dispatch reports, the Kincade fire spread to about 1,000 acres by 11 p.m.\n\nCal Fire spokesman Will Powers said the blaze near the Geysers area was burning at a \u201cdangerous rate.\u201d\n\nSonoma County Supervisor James Gore said PG&E was better this time about getting information to people who would be affected, but he was still astonished by the need to resort to large-scale blackouts.\n\n\u201cI am a big believer in shutdowns to prevent fires. But the thing that erodes public trust is when it doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he said. \u201cYou say, \u2018God, I know if we can put a man on the moon \u2026 we can manage a (power) grid.\u2019\u201d\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writers Janie Har in San Francisco and Christopher Weber in Los Angeles contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Dangerously windy weather sweeping through the state brought power outages to Northern California as the state's largest utility staged blackouts designed to prevent catastrophic wildfires.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jocelyn Gecker"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/23/california_wildfires_blackout_89172_c0-0-2000-1166_s1200x700.jpg?10a57a34575c6b259c990fae314f4f7b2a5156f5", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
