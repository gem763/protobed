And the latter is able to break down in home garden composting conditions and will work as a fertilizer afterwards.\n\nThere are lots of brands who champion making tea bags without these tiny plastic pieces, and there\u2019s more that are changing to rid themselves of it too.\n\nBut if you\u2019re favourite brand doesn\u2019t offer a plastic free bag of your favourite brew, you can also use loose leaf tea.\n\nWe looked for brands that not only used alternative materials to plastic in the actual tea bag, but ones that also removed plastic from the packaging, reduced excess materials and tags, paid producers a fair wage, and of course, tasted excellent.\n\nHere\u2019s our roundup of tea bags that are free of plastic.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

He began making tea as just a side project, and is now responsible for the brand\u2019s signature blends. The pyramid bags \u2013 made from soilon, a bi-product of cornstarch that's best going in food waste \u2013 are large and give a well rounded, delicate but full-flavoured brew that\u2019s organic, too. The entirety of the packaging is biodegradable, including the inner plastic-looking lining and reusable seal, made with Nature-flex \u2013 which is woodpulp \u2013 that\u2019s also home compostable, and takes between three to six months to decompose at home.\n\nBuy now\n\nBrew Tea Co proper tea earl grey: \u00a34.95 for 15, Brew Tea Co\n\nThis brand is all about as transparent and sustainable as it comes, and the brand makes it all fun too. Brew Tea \u2013 based in Manchester, uses whole leaves (not dust, it insists) and is a member of the Ethical Tea Partnership which supports small estate grower. This is a refreshing brew full of flavour mixing bergamot oil with ceylon black tea, orange peel and calendula petals. All the tea bags from the brand are made from cornstarch, the inner lining is made from Nature-flex and inside the box is a really useful card telling you what all the packing is made from and how it should be recycled: from the council food recycling (tea bags and inner lining) which decomposes at 45 days to the outer box which goes into the paper recycling.\n\nBuy now\n\nClipper organic everyday tea: \u00a33.49 for 80, Clipper\n\nIt might look most like an ordinary teabag, but this is far, far from it. Each teabag is unbleached (hence it\u2019s more earthy colour), organic, fairtrade, plastic free and non GM. It was the world\u2019s first pillow-shaped bag to meet this criteria and was launched in 2018. And if that\u2019s not enough, it was even the world\u2019s first fairtrade tea. The teabag is made from abaca plants \u2013 a type of banana \u2013 and the plastic that sealed the bag is replaced with a material made from non-GM plants and it's become our new go-to every day tea. Just like it says. And it's by far the most affordable on the list. Although Clipper has ticked many boxes with its teabag, it's now working on making the inner foil packaging recyclable too.\n\nBuy now\n\nHampstead Tea whole leaf home compostable pyramids: \u00a34.49 for 15, Hampstead Tea\n\nWe love this brand's ethos of \"cup to compost\", where all the pyramids are made from GM-free sugar startch, which is home compostable, along with the inner plastic-look pouch that holds the tea bags. Hampstead Tea was the first company to produce a fully home compostable bag \u2013 which takes 91 days. The tea is whole leaf and all the ingredients are organic or biodynamic, where no chemicals are used. We love that there's no string or labels on the bags and it comes with a little handy bamboo tong to grab your bag out \u2013 perfect when there's no spoons in the office. The earl grey makes an excellent, well-rounded brew. There's also four others flavours in the range.\n\n\u200b We Are Tea English breakfast tea: \u00a32.49 for 15, Ocado\n\nThis whole-leaf tea company started in 2007, and was the first brand to remove the paper tags from teabags. In 2012, We Are Tea joined the Ethical Tea Partnership and moved from nylon bags to ones made from soilon. Each teabag is sealed by ultrasound instead of glue, which makes them biodegradable at an industrial level between three and six months, so make sure you put them in your council food waste bin. It can go in your home compost, but it will take much longer (at least 18 months). When the tea first launched, the plastic inner part of the packaging was not recyclable, but it's now made from Nature-flex, too.\n\nBuy now\n\nEteaket royal earl grey tea bags: From \u00a34.95 for 15, Eteaket\n\nBased in Edinburgh, this ethically sourced tea specialist caf\u00e9, which opened in 2008, sells its own brews in tea bags and loose leaf and is part of the Ethical Tea Partnership. The tea bags are made from soilon, which isn\u2019t bleached and is biodegradable. The tag is made from paper which is not laminated and is attached to the string via ultrasound, while the inner packaging, made from Nature-flex, is recyclable and can be composted at home. The brand is also working on making all its wholesale orders plastic free too. We love this as a weekend morning brew. And definitely go to the cafe when you're in town.\n\nBuy now\n\nNemi Tea green tea : \u00a34.50 for 15, Nemiteas\n\nThe teabags at Nemi have always been plastic free, since launching in October 2017. The pyramid bags are made from soilon, are guaranteed GM free and are totally biodegradable at industrial level. There\u2019s no glue used to attach the string and labels, instead it's joined by ultrasound and all the packaging is made with Natur-flex. What we love most about this that the brand also helps refugees integrate into the UK by employing them to run their tea stalls.\n\nBuy now\n\nT2 French earl grey teabag gift cube: \u00a38 for 25, T2\n\nThis Australian brand, born in 1996 in Melbourne, reached the UK in 2014 in London\u2019s Shoreditch (and grew to 14 stores in the capital) and takes its sustainability seriously. The bags are made from cornstarch, but have a more opaque appearance than any of the others we tested. The bags will breakdown in home composting but it can take a long as 18-24 months so it\u2019s best to put it into your local council food composting where it will be quicker. The inner plastic is not recyclable, but the brand is working on switching this to a plant based material by 2020. This is our favourite new tea for it's floral flavour that we love devouring from a pot at the weekends.\n\nBuy now\n\nRoqberry: \u00a37 for 18, The Food Market\n\nAfter launching in 2017, Roqberry prides itself on championing \u201cblending the rules\u201d by using classic flavours to create modern fusions such as \u201caromatic sushi and spice\u201d and \u201cblack smoke\u201d. These pyramid teabags, made from soilon, encase the single-source tea that comes in black, green, herbal, rooibos and oolong, and all are biodegradable. As it won\u2019t breakdown in under a year, this tea bag should be thrown out with your council food waste as soilon composes at industrial standards (in six to eight weeks). The cube boxes are made from FSC paper that\u2019s easily recyclable, too.\n\nBuy now\n\nPukka Herbs: \u00a32.45 for 20, Holland and Barrett\n\nLaunched in 2001 in Bristol, Pukka Tea\u2019s bags differ from all others as each bag is wrapped in an individual envelope to ensure freshness \u2013 and it\u2019s more environmentally friendly than you might think. It took four years of research to develop this new packaging, and it has removed more than 100 tonnes of plastic from the brand\u2019s supply chain. The envelope contains only a very thin layer of BPA and PVC free plastic, but is still able to be recycled with paper. Since 2014 the brand stopped using a staple to connect the organic string and plastic-free label, and instead uses a little stitch to attach it.\n\nBuy now\n\nGood & Proper Tea: \u00a35 for 15 teabags, Good & Proper Tea\n\nWhat began life as a mobile tea bar, has now found a permanent cafe in east London. The plastic free range was added in 2017 and is made from the non toxic material soilon (which needs to go in a collected food waste bin). These are the largest bags we tested and aside from Clipper\u2019s pillow shaped bags, are the only one that comes in a flat large square shape, instead of the pyramid. Bags are packaged in a plastic alternative, the plant based material called Vegware which is also compostable, but at industrial levels..\n\nBuy now\n\nTwinings loose leaf pyramid bag: \u00a36.50 for 15, Twinings\n\nThe Twinings pyramid tea bags have always been plastic free since it was launched in October 2014. They are made from maize starch which is treated by an enzyme that allows it to be spun into filaments. The tea bags include loose leaf tea which makes an excellent brew, but each bag has a label attached that\u2019s covered in a thin layer of plastic \u2013 so it won\u2019t dissolve if it ends up in your brew, apparently \u2013 and will need to be removed before composting. The inner foil wrapper isn\u2019t recyclable, but Twinings is the process of reviewing it\u2019s range to finpukkd alternatives.\n\nBuy now\n\nTeapigs everyday brew tea bags: \u00a33.99 for 15, Ocado\n\nTeapigs was the first brand to receive the world\u2019s first plastic-free trust mark, created by the campaign group A Plastic Planet in May 2018. These biodegradable bags are made from cornstarch, while the paper tags use vegetable inks and are, you'll be glad to read, non-toxic. Don\u2019t be dismayed when you open your box, as even the clear \u201cplastic\u201d inner bag (made from natureflex) is compostable. The bags can go in your home food recycling bin for compost, which may feel strange, but they will compost.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Plastic free tea bags\n\nWe love the flavour and eco-packaging of Abel & Cole's indubitably excellent organic earl grey tea, which is our winner.
