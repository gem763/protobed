In some cases, it's put them in dangerous situations.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to 28 former and current Target workers, 13 of whom said they felt that the shift changes made their backrooms an unsafe work environment.\n\nTarget cut overnight and backroom shifts in some of its stores across the country over the last several months, the retailer confirmed in an email. In some stores, those positions were eliminated completely, while in others they were drastically scaled back.\n\nThe workers in eliminated positions were given the option to switch to daytime shifts, the company said, adding that shift changes have been rolling out to various markets since 2016 before launching nationally this year.\n\nWithout people working those overnight and backroom shifts, the backrooms in many Target stores have become overcrowded and, in some cases, unsafe, some workers said. As a result, the daytime workers, whose responsibilities also include helping customers, have been expected to pick up the slack.\n\nSome employees say their stores underwent changes as early as September 2018, likely as part of the earlier trial period, while others say they only started noticing differences in the last few months.\n\n\"There was a point where my store should have been shut down due to unsafe working conditions,\" said a former leader in an overnight inbound team who worked at a New Hampshire Target for three years and left in February.\n\nThis worker and others \u2014 some current, some former employees \u2014 were granted anonymity in order to speak frankly about working conditions and the situation more generally at Target.\n\nThe former employee in New Hampshire said that changes in her store began last September and took effect practically overnight. Without enough people whose jobs were dedicated to clearing away deliveries, boxes of merchandise piled up in the backroom, she said, adding that the store often stacked thousands of pieces of freight in piles that could be up to eight feet tall. Wooden platforms \u2014 called pallets \u2014 were often scattered on the sales floor or placed in a way that made them likely to fall on passersby.\n\nRead more: Target quietly ended overnight shifts in some stores, and employees say their workload has become 'chaotic' as they try to keep up\n\n\"At Target, the safety of our guests, team members and community is always our top priority,\" the company said in a statement to Business Insider. \"Our store leaders and team members undergo mandatory safety training every year and we invest in the technology, tools and processes that keep our stores safe and ensure we comply with all federal safety guidelines.

The employee said her location had eliminated the entire backroom team in the spring and that it was not uncommon to find items that were incorrectly stocked.\n\n\"It is a nightmare to work there these days,\" said Rob Butkus, a former team lead in a Chicago area Target store who said he quit in July, two months before his 10-year anniversary at the company.\n\nHe said that the shift changes created unprecedented stress in his store and that his backroom was previously organized when there was a staff to take care of it. When those shifts were cut, he said, his store's backroom became a \"total nightmare.\"\n\nA former part-time employee who worked in a Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, Target for about a year until October 2018 said that her store was a pilot location where Target's new changes were tested. She said that before the backroom shifts were eliminated at her store, stocking was a side priority, and doing extensive work in the backroom was never done by regular employees.\n\nOnce the shift changes happened, this employee, who worked in electronics, said she hurt herself multiple times in the electronics stockroom, which was narrower and separate from other merchandise.\n\n\"[I] would sometimes tell a guest we were out of a product purely because I didn't want to brave the electronics stockroom for something that wouldn't affect my sales numbers,\" she said, describing a space with aisles barely more than two feet wide with sharp metal corners.\n\nA photo of backroom in a New Hampshire Target last October. Courtesy of an anonymous former Target employee\n\nA former Illinois Target employee who left his job in May said his backroom had posters that outlined certain OSHA standards such as the minimum points of contact required before climbing a ladder. The employee said that given the crowded nature of the room, these standards were almost impossible to adhere to.\n\nRead more: We visited nearly 40 stores in 3 months, and the messiest of the bunch is also one of the most successful right now\n\nBlocked fire exits, fire extinguishers, and electrical cabinets\n\nAnother current employee in a Target store in the Midwest also said that safety violations exist in the backroom on a daily basis.\n\n\"They're only ever compliant just before and during corporate or safety visits,\" he said.\n\nA New Jersey store worker said that he had observed safety issues such as blocked fire exits, blocked fire extinguishers, and blocked electrical cabinets. All three of these blockages could be classified as violations of OSHA standards, said part-time senior occupational safety and health consultant Tim Gordon, who worked as an OSHA compliance officer between 1988 and 1989. Gordon currently works part-time at Safety Controls Technology, a company that provides occupational safety and health solutions to ensure that its clients adhere to local and federal regulations.\n\nA photo of an Arizona Target store taken in July. An employee said that the backroom sometimes gets so full that merchandise spills onto the sales floor, blocking shoppers' pathways. Courtesy of an anonymous Target Employee\n\n\"Everyone has been told, 'Make it fit,' somewhere,\" the New Jersey store worker said.\n\nThis employee, who has worked with Target for nearly 10 years, noted that many locations' backrooms have historically been chaotic, but that the changes in shifts have caused the mess to bleed into the aisles as well.\n\nA spokesperson for Target declined to comment further on questions about its stores' backrooms possibly violating OSHA standards.\n\nWe saw a mess in virtually every section of a Manhattan Target we visited, from groceries to cosmetics. Shoshy Ciment/Business Insider\n\nDoing more with less\n\nThirteen former and current employees said that payroll hours in their stores were cut drastically in the last year, which has forced employees to complete heavy workloads in a short amount of time.\n\nA spokesman for Target disputed this, saying the company's mix of full-time and part-time employees has remained consistent and that nearly half of employees are working more hours today than in previous years on average. The spokesman also said that Target has invested more than ever into payroll. Target declined to provide specific numbers when asked about payroll hours.\n\nA current part-time backroom employee in a California Target store said she has had at least three major panic attacks in the last year, as she says she is expected to move at a pace that is \"completely unrealistic.\"\n\n\"I was in charge of 32 isles [sic] by myself and I cried twice in the backroom because I left [sic] like I was drowning in work,\" said a current Target employee who has been working at an Arizona Target store for the last two years.\n\nShe said the changes were implemented in her store around five months ago.\n\nAnother employee who worked in a Winter Garden, Florida, Target for six years said hours in her store were slashed across the board near the start of the year. She currently still works one shift there, but said the changes had initially made it nearly impossible to get her work done.\n\n\"I was literally having panic attacks almost every day,\" she said. \"It's like a no-win situation.\"", "description": "Former and current Target employees said their backrooms had become messier and even unsafe since the shift changes and cuts were implemented.", "authors": ["Shoshy Ciment"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8a29382e22af3d5f1775c8?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
