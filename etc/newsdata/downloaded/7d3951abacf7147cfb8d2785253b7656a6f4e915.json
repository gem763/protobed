We've put the barriers back in place.'\n\nThe council's explanation sparked an angry reaction from bemused residents.\n\n'This is ridiculous. Where's the logic in widening a road around a telegraph pole? How on earth is any extra width useable with a poke in the middle? Who signed off on such a poor plan? Another irresponsible use of ratepayers money,' one woman commented.\n\nAnother added: 'Why would you change the road layout before the power pole could be moved? How bloody stupid.'\n\nNewcastle Council chief executive Jeremy Bath went on radio to clear up the mystery, where he placed the blame on electricity provider Ausgrid over the unsafe power pole.\n\nNewcastle Council claims the power pole was surrounded by barricades, which disappeared over the weekend but were quickly replaced on Monday\n\n'Anything involving electricity, they will not touch,' Mr Bath told Triple M Newcastle listeners on Monday.\n\n'So any time that we need \u2014 and we do a whole heap of work where we want Ausgrid to come in and actually turn something off essentially, like a telegraph pole so it can be relocated \u2014 Ausgrid say 'Sorry, we can't do it at the moment'.\n\n'So our choices are we either do no work or we have to stage work such as what you're seeing in Foundry St.'\n\nAusgrid later released a statement, vowing to work as quickly as possible to schedule an outage to move the pole after 'council has proceeded with the work leaving the pole in an unsafe location.\n\n'This pole has not moved but as a result of works by Newcastle Council to move the kerb, this pole has now been left in the road, clearly in an unsafe location,'the statement read.\n\n'It is disappointing to read comments by council CEO Jeremy Bath who stated Council proceeded with this work to move the kerb knowing full well that the pole would be left in the roadway as a result.'\n\nNewcastle Council and Ausgrid have blamed each other for the pole's bizarre position\n\nAusgrid confirmed it put a pause on live work on its network after employee Robert Nicholls tragically lost his life when he was electrocuted while completing live work in April, prompting a comprehensive safety review.\n\n'Our decision was driven solely by Ausgrid\u2019s commitment to the safety of our people, contractors and the community who work on, and use, the network,' the statement continued.\n\nCouncils across our network have respected the process Ausgrid has gone through and have worked closely and collaboratively with us following the fatality as we go through the process of ensuring our workers are safe undertaking works.\n\n'Ausgrid acknowledges that the pause on live work has caused some disruptions, but we do not step back from our commitment to ensure workers can go home to their loved ones safely at the end of the day.'", "description": "A newly installed power pole installed in the middle of a widened road has baffled Newcastle residents as the local council and an electricity provider blame each other for the confusion.", "authors": ["Kylie Stevens For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/05/20267754-0-image-a-74_1572241125217.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
