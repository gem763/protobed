In \u201cArrested,\u201d Jack Kennison, a miserable, remorseful semi-lout who\u2019ll become Olive\u2019s next husband, is driving to buy whiskey in Portland, Maine, because he hates small talk in the fictional coastal town of Crosby, where he (and most of the novel\u2019s ensemble cast) resides.\n\nAD\n\nReview: Family matters in \u2018Olive Kitteridge\u2019\n\nWasting no time, this opening chapter discharges big questions serially, like a cannon. How had Jack mauled his first marriage so fecklessly, with a flagrant affair that got him fired? Why did he never realize that his late wife had been quietly conducting her own affair? Why can\u2019t he accept that his grown daughter is gay?\n\n\u201cHe understood that he was a seventy-four-year-old man who looks back at life and marvels that it unfolded as it did, who feels unbearable regret for all the mistakes made. And then he thought: How does one live an honest life?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBoom, boom, boom. In a torrent of shocking passages, people perceive their own blindnesses. What frightened Jack \u201cwas how much of his life he had lived without knowing who he was or what he was doing,\u201d and how much he\u2019d squandered because of it.\n\nElizabeth Strout\u2019s \u2018My Name is Lucy Barton\u2019 review\n\n\u201cLabor\u201d brings Olive forward in all her feisty glory, angrily recalling a \u201cstupid baby shower\u201d in hilarious detail \u2014 fussy food, inane chatter \u2014 then, suddenly, being forced to help deliver an actual baby (its confused young mother an \u201cidiot child\u201d) in the back seat of Olive\u2019s own car. Things get graphic, fast. But before that, as someone\u2019s cooing over a pair of booties, \u201cOlive suddenly thought how she had not been happy even before Henry had his stroke.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBafflement swamps her. \u201cOlive did not understand why age had brought with it a kind of hardheartedness toward her husband . . . something she had seemed unable to help . . . as her heart became more constricted, Henry\u2019s heart became needier. . . . What crime had he been committing, except to ask for her love?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe End of the Civil War Days\u201d features a couple living in silent enmity on two sides of a strip of yellow duct tape bisecting their house, following the husband\u2019s long-ago affair: \u201cBack then there was no forgiveness and no divorce.\u201d Their petrified state\u2019s about to be cracked open \u2014 as a visiting daughter informs them she\u2019s become a dominatrix.\n\nPeople are weak, locked, blinkered. They suffer cruelties, reversals. Yet in strange adaptations, many find ways through or past it. Without room for the swaths of material I long to quote, I can only cite the marrow of \u201cOlive\u2019s\u201d glory: wave upon wave of unflinching insight, delivered in language so clean it shines. Sentences flow in simplest words and clearest order \u2014 yet line after line hammers home some of the most complex human rawness you\u2019ll ever read. Early on, Olive is terrified to let herself become close to Jack: Her life \u201cmight possibly be very different or might not be different at all, and both ideas were unspeakably awful to her. . . . Please, she thought. But she did not know what she meant by that. Please, she thought again. Please.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStrout dwells with uncanny immediacy inside the minds and hearts of a dazzling range of ages: the young (with their confusion, wonder, awakening sexuality), the middle-aged (envy, striving, compromise), the old (failing bodies, societal shunning, late revelations). I cannot shake off the electrifying \u201cHelped,\u201d in which a woman whose childhood house (containing her father) has just burned down, returns to Crosby to deal with the ruins.\n\nAlmost broken by trauma, Suzanne turns to Bernie, the gentle family attorney, who tries valiantly to shore her up. Buried in their (astonishing) conversation is a small, hard jewel of a vision that may irradiate Strout\u2019s whole oeuvre. Suzanne finally offers Bernie her best guess about what the human task may ultimately be, in our catastrophic riddle of a world: \u201cTo bear the burden of the mystery with as much grace as we can.\u201d\n\nBoom.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI have long and deeply admired all of Strout\u2019s work, but \u201cOlive, Again\u201d transcends and triumphs. The naked pain, dignity, wit and courage these stories consistently embody fill us with a steady, wrought comfort. In Olive\u2019s words: \u201cWhat a thing!\u201d\n\nJoan Frank\u2019s latest books, \u201cWhere You\u2019re All Going: Four Novellas\u201d and \u201cTry to Get Lost: Essays on Travel and Place,\u201d will be published in early 2020.\n\nOlive, Again\n\nBy Elizabeth Strout\n\nRandom House. 304 pp. $27\n\nAD", "description": "Elizabeth Strout creates a world almost unbearably addictive for its beautiful, agonized truths.", "authors": ["Joan Frank"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Wm4nIn0CP4U1B8DYF5eDJDxZzN0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EIF4MXHF5UI6TNAD644ITGMC2I.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
