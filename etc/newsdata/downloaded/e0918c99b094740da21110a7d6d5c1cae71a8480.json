For years, I had to drive to far corners for explicitly vegetarian restaurants or pick up something frozen from the supermarket to enjoy what would usually be a blend of grains, beans and cheap vegetables. Here was a sign that times were truly changing, yet when it arrived and I took a bite, I immediately began to tear up, looking at my sister with terror: I was so sure I\u2019d just eaten beef, for the first time in years. When the waitress returned, I asked, \u201cIs this a veggie burger?\u201d She replied, \u201cYes, it\u2019s a Beyond burger.\u201d I couldn\u2019t finish it, so uncanny was its resemblance to actual ground beef. My appetite was lost, and I pined for the days of driving 20 miles for something recognizable as food \u2014 as vegetables.\n\n[One thing might keep the Impossible Burger from saving the planet: Steak]\n\nThat was my first experience with the new wave of tech burgers, which were brought into the world by Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods. The former has a base of pea protein, while the latter is soy based. Both have been engineered to resemble beef as closely as possible to entice carnivores to cut more beef from their diets because of its destructive impact on the environment. These were never food for vegetarians and vegans. The Impossible Burger launched itself through chefs such as David Chang, a previously vocal anti-vegetarian, and has now landed on menus at Burger Kings, White Castles and Little Caesars across the nation. These aren\u2019t spaces known for a vegetarian-friendly ethos.\n\nBut the increasing ubiquity of these meat facsimiles on menus has created a strange moment for those of us who long ago chose to eschew the consumption of animal flesh: Where are the burgers for people who don\u2019t want to eat anything that tastes like meat? What was once the most reliable menu item for non-meat-eaters has become almost overtaken by these tech options, appearing with trademark symbols on menus, and a fear pervades: Will true veggie burgers go extinct? For now, although many restaurants are choosing to put only tech burgers on their menus, others are sticking to their housemade versions or running them side by side.\n\n\n\nSuperiority Burgers, made from vegetables, grains and beans. See recipe link below. (Jennifer Chase for The Washington Post)\n\nFor Ruth Tal, owner of the vegan chain Fresh \u2014 which has locations in Toronto and, soon, Los Angeles \u2014 their Beyond burger has been a smashing success, but it still hasn\u2019t made sense to take their veggie burger off the menu. The latter is composed of almonds, tofu, millet, beets, carrots, parsley, spices and herbs. In June, they sold 6,500 Beyond burgers and 6,000 of their veggie.\n\n[Make the recipe: Superiority Burgers]\n\n\u201cIf sales of our original burger patty were cannibalized, we would have listened and stopped serving it,\u201d Tal says. \u201cBut the good news is that they are just as strong as ever. I believe the Beyond stands apart because of the pea protein, the meaty texture, and our housemade \u2018special\u2019 sauce.\u201d To her, the customers who opt for each are very different, and the options complement each other.\n\nHoneybee\u2019s, a new vegan barbecue restaurant in New York\u2019s East Village, serves just the Impossible Burger, for reasons of consistency, ease and flavor. But chef Amira Gharib tries to make it her own. \u201cI mix [the Impossible meat] with a couple things just to give it our own touch and to throw in a couple of classic flavors: shallots, vegan Worcestershire sauce,\u201d Gharib says. \u201cI think Impossible Burger did a great job with the base, now it\u2019s up to chefs to create their own blends and burgers. Ours is made with beer-battered and caramelized onion, delicious Chao cheddar and our homemade barbecue sauce.\u201d\n\nNitehawk Cinema, which has two locations in Brooklyn, also serves both a Beyond Meat patty and a traditional veggie burger. Michael Franey, executive chef at the Williamsburg location, says he likes having the option on the menu. \u201cI know there are a lot of vegetarians and vegans who don\u2019t like the texture of ground meat,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re both called a veggie burger, but they\u2019re very different experiences,\u201d adds Blessing Schuman-Strange, executive chef at the Prospect Park location.\n\n\n\nMushroom Chickpea Burgers. See recipe link, below. (Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)\n\nStill more chefs are choosing to continue making veggie burgers in-house. In Nashville, at Hugh-Baby\u2019s, run by pitmaster Pat Martin, they blend black beans, onions, cashews and smoked mushrooms to create a hearty patty with an umami essence.\n\n[Make the recipe: Mushroom Chickpea Burgers]\n\n\u201cAs much as I love meat, I personally love veggie burgers,\u201d Martin says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a really good one, so I wanted to make one that I loved. As a society, we\u2019re moving more towards plant-based eating, so it was important for me to have a veggie option on the menu.\u201d\n\nAs for why he continues to make it in-house rather than outsource to Beyond or Impossible, it\u2019s about having his fingerprint on everything he serves, and the financials bear that out. Tal says the only con about serving the premade patties is that the much slimmer margins drive up the cost for customers. At Bird and Cleaver in Fort Wayne, Ind., an omnivorous restaurant that heavily features vegan options, Lindsay Cheesebrew serves only a housemade veggie burger made from quinoa, walnuts, mushrooms and white beans. \u201cI think it\u2019s just not as special if you can get it everywhere,\u201d she says of the tech burger patties. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s still a processed burger.\u201d\n\nAmanda Cohen, chef at New York\u2019s Dirt Candy, will be launching her own veggie burger restaurant \u2014 \u201cthe market demands it,\u201d she says \u2014 come fall and will reach far back into history for her take: a 900-year-old recipe from the Ming Dynasty of China that uses 10 all-natural ingredients. She has resisted veggie burgers in the past, despite serving broccoli dogs and carrot sliders at her restaurant. While she recognizes that tech burgers fill a need for those who would like to eat less meat or were never able to eat a burger for religious reasons, they don\u2019t appeal to her vegetable-forward sensibilities.\n\n\u201cIf the idea is to make people healthier and change the way we look at food and how we eat, we should celebrate the things we have instead of making things in a lab,\u201d she says, which calls to mind how forcefully Impossible and Beyond are targeting fast food over small, local restaurants. Cohen says that perhaps this isn\u2019t the most sustainable way to get the population to consume less meat. \u201cLet\u2019s eat vegetables and put farmers to work,\u201d she says, \u201cand eat the things we already know are healthy.\u201d\n\nMore from Voraciously:\n\n5 recipes that will help change your mind about veggie burgers\n\nBurger King\u2019s Impossible Whopper tastes even better than the real thing\n\nBeyond Meat\u2019s latest plant-based burger is meatier, juicier and a big step closer to beef", "description": "Some of us want a burger made of recognizable vegetables, not something high-tech that's engineered to replicate the taste and texture of meat.", "authors": ["Alicia Kennedy", "September At Am", "Alicia Kennedy Is A Brooklyn-Based Food Writer."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rw6KctMGpNz-30e0Htwx6PfXV_U=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WMAAL34MLY4LDNKYJYFWNMOY4U.jpg"}
