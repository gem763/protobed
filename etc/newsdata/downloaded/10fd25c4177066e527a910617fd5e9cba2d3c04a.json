People were panicking and running as security staff were running the other way.\"\n\nBev Hughes, Greater Manchester's deputy mayor for policing, crime and fire, said: \"I want to praise Greater Manchester's emergency services for their swift and professional action.\"\n\n(Image: Manchester Evening News WS)\n\n\"The scene has been secured and all emergency services are engaged in ensuring public safety - the investigation is ongoing.\"\n\nThe North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) has been stood down from the incident.\n\nNWAS said in a statement: \"We have been dealing with the incident alongside Greater Manchester Police since 11.15 until 13.56 today.\"\n\nIt added: \"A large number of staff have been involved and we dispatched 13 ambulances, four hazardous area response vehicles, two advanced paramedics, two doctors and two officers to the scene.\n\n\"We would like to thank the public for their assistance and patience whilst we dealt with the incident, and express our gratitude to all our staff who have worked hard over the last few hours.\"", "description": "A man in his 40s has been arrested as counter-terror police probe the stabbings which happened at the Arndale Centre in Manchester just after 11am", "authors": ["Jennifer Williams", "John Shammas", "Amber Hicks", "Image", "Jdworsley Twitter", "John Greenhalgh Via Reuters", "Pa", "Manchester Evening News Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20561480.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-Arndale-terror-suspect-being-led-away-by-police.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
