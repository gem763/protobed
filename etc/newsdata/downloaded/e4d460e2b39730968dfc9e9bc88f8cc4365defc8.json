They got to see a glimpse of it during a 4-3 win over the Cincinnati Reds on Tuesday night as nine rookies played and contributed heavily to the victory.\n\nKyle Lewis hit a towering home run on the day he was called up to the big leagues. Justus Sheffield pitched his longest outing of the season. And Dylan Moore helped the team turn four double plays and hit his own homer.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got guys that are debuting, you\u2019ve got guys that are young, that are just getting here, there\u2019s an excitement level there,\u201d Mariners third baseman Kyle Seager said. \u201cEvery day will bring something new whether you\u2019re in (the pennant race) or not.\u201d\n\nThe 31-year-old Seager hit a two-run homer in the eighth inning as the Mariners ended a six-game losing streak.\n\nBut it was the rookies who grabbed the attention.\n\nLewis, a 24-year-old outfielder who was one of four players called up Tuesday from Double-A Arkansas, collected the team\u2019s first hit against Trevor Bauer in the fifth inning.\n\nLewis was just the fifth Mariners player to hit a home run in his debut and the first since 2006. The drive, measured at 426 feet by Statcast, tied the score at 1.\n\n\u201cI was just trying to keep it as simple as possible, try not to make things bigger than they are,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cWhen I hit that, though, it was definitely like an out-of-body experience.\u201d\n\nTwo other rookies homered: Moore gave the Mariners a 2-1 lead in the sixth against Bauer with his eighth home run.\n\nCincinnati\u2019s Brian O\u2019Grady, who debuted on Aug. 8, put the Reds ahead 3-2 in the eighth with his first homer. O\u2019Grady pinch-hit and had a two-run drive off Austin Adams.\n\nMichael Lorenzen walked Austin Nola with one out in the eighth. Amir Garrett (4-3) entered, and Seager drove Garrett\u2019s seventh consecutive slider over the right field wall.\n\nDan Altavilla (1-0) pitched around a leadoff walk in the eighth for his first big league win since May 18 last year against Detroit. Anthony Bass tossed a perfect ninth for his third save.\n\nSheffield pitched six innings, striking out four and allowing just one run - on an RBI single from Freddy Galvis - on seven hits. The left-hander earned his first quality start and has struck out 11 in 11 innings in his last two starts.\n\nThough he allowed 10 baserunners, the Mariners picked him up with four double plays. Sheffield started one of those on his own and also cleanly fielded two comebackers for outs.\n\n\u201cThe confidence is growing, and you can see him making pitches and slowing things down when he needs to,\u201d Seattle manager Scott Servais said. \u201cHe\u2019s relaxed, he\u2019s getting back to doing what he\u2019s doing, and trusts his ability at this level, and it\u2019s great he\u2019s getting the result right now, too.\u201d\n\nBauer had a no-hitter through 5 1/3 innings and finished with eight strikeouts and three walks in 6 1/3 innings. He was pulled after 116 pitches.\n\n\u201cWe read the ball early and had quite a few hits,\u201d Reds manager David Bell said. \u201cThen the double plays got us.\u201d\n\nMEMORY LANE\n\nBell spent the off-day Monday visiting old haunts and marveling at how Seattle\u2019s changed in the nearly two decades since he was with the Mariners.\n\n\u201cI love the city,\u201d Bell said. \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite city - other than Cincinnati.\u201d\n\nBell spent parts of four seasons with Seattle and fondly recalls manager Lou Piniella.\n\n\u201cI think about him all the time doing this job,\u201d Bell said. \u201cI learned a lot from him I didn\u2019t even realize while I was playing for him. He had the ability to make every game like the seventh game of the World Series. He was a winner and he would not accept anything less from every person in the clubhouse than their absolute best every day. He had a way of motivating through his own expectations.\u201d\n\nMARINERS MOVES\n\nIn addition to Lewis, Seattle promoted Lewis, RHPs Justin Dunn and Art Warren and SS Donnie Walton. Warren teared up in front of reporters while describing the clubhouse celebration in Arkansas when players received the news. OF Ryan Court was designated for assignment.\n\nLewis and Walton made their major league debuts, pushing Seattle to a couple of records. The Mariners have now used 65 players this season, snapping Texas\u2019 2015 record of 64. And 19 rookies have debuted for the team this year, one more than the Rangers in 2015.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nReds: Nick Senzel (right shoulder) has not played the outfield since Sept. 3 but could pinch run. \u201cWe had to make a deal with him,\u201d Bell said.\n\nMariners: Servais said SS J.P. Crawford (strained left hamstring) could return this weekend against the Chicago White Sox. \u2026 Rookie CF Jake Fraley (right thumb), who hasn\u2019t played since Saturday, had an MRI on Monday but Servais said he did not have an update.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nReds RHP Sonny Gray (10-6, 2.75 ERA) starts Wednesday against LHP Marco Gonzales, Gray is 7-1 wth a 1.55 ERA in his last 13 starts. Marco Gonzales (14-11, 4.60 ERA) is 9-4 since June 7.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The rebuilding Seattle Mariners have spent the last year talking about the future.
