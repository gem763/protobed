The motherless child hiding in the curtains is from \u201cJane Eyre.\u201d Children observing adults from the top of the stairs recalls Henry James\u2019s \u201cWhat Maisie Knew.\u201d And any tight, inscrutable sibling bond will always summon up \u201cThe Turn of the Screw,\u201d which Maeve happens to keep on her nightstand. Later we see her reading \u201cHousekeeping,\u201d Marilynne Robinson\u2019s novel about a pair of siblings abandoned by their mother.\n\nPatchett\u2019s prose is confident, unfussy and unadorned. I can\u2019t pluck out one sentence worth quoting, but how effective they are when woven together \u2014 these translucent lines that envelop you like a spider\u2019s web. It can feel old-fashioned: her style, her attachment to a very traditional kind of storytelling \u2014 a vision of the novel as a Dutch house, with a clarity and transparency of purpose and method, a refusal of narrative tricksiness. But like the family\u2019s Dutch house, it\u2019s an enduring structure, which gives an added dimension to the references in the text \u2014 its way of gesturing toward a lineage.\n\nAnother lineage flows through the book: the theme that unites Patchett\u2019s fiction and nonfiction. \u201cMothers were the measure of safety,\u201d Danny thinks, grateful for Maeve\u2019s protection after his mother\u2019s disappearance. \u201cHome, bed, sleep, mother \u2014 who knew more beautiful words than these?\u201d Patchett wrote in her 2007 book \u201cRun.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t have a baby,\u201d she describes her grandmother pleading, in an essay on caring for her in her final years. \u201cWhat she meant was that she was my baby and I didn\u2019t need another one.\u201d In \u201cTruth and Beauty,\u201d Patchett\u2019s memoir of her friendship with the poet Lucy Grealy, she writes about Grealy\u2019s claim on her. \u201cDo you love me?\u201d Grealy would ask her, climbing into her lap, even in the middle of dinner parties, begging to be held and carried. \u201cOf course I love you,\u201d Patchett would respond. \u201cBest?\u201d \u201cYes, best, but you are crushing my thigh.\u201d\n\nOur willingness to serve each other represents the best of us, according to Patchett, and it is almost as if she wants to take the notion of motherhood and release its power into the commons \u2014 what if we were willing to mother one another, mother strangers? But she is also always full of warnings about the self-abnegation it requires, especially of women \u2014 and never more clearly than in this new novel.\n\nWhen Danny marries, it is to a bright woman for whom renunciation comes easily. \u201cCeleste was plenty happy in those days, though in retrospect she was the ultimate victim of bad timing, thinking that because she was good in chemistry she should marry a doctor instead of becoming a doctor herself. Had she come along a few years later she might have missed that trap altogether.\u201d Meanwhile, Maeve, a brilliant student in her youth \u2014 the winner of a math medal at Barnard \u2014 leads a pinched life, moving back home, working as bookkeeper, keeping herself single and available to care for her brother into adulthood.\n\n\u201cThe love between humans is the thing that nails us to this earth,\u201d Patchett wrote in her memoir \u201cThis Is the Story of a Happy Marriage\u201d \u2014 a belief her new novel shares but shades with caution. There\u2019s no missing the statement\u2019s brutal, brilliant ambivalence.", "description": "\u201cThe Dutch House\u201d is about a brother and sister whose lives are changed when a stepmother enters their family.", "authors": ["Parul Sehgal"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/24/books/24bookpatchett1/24bookpatchett1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
