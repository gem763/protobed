We are more about the process of how we practice.\u201d\n\nMaryland linebacker Shaq Smith is familiar with Syracuse after having transferred from Clemson and played against the Orange. The Terrapins held Howard to 68 yards on 57 plays, but Smith knows Syracuse is an entirely different animal.\n\n\u201cThere is always room for improvement,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI would say the number one thing, on defense, we have to improve on is communicating more.\u201d\n\nLed by transfer quarterback Josh Jackson from Virginia Tech, the Maryland offense will have a tough task against a Syracuse defense that includes senior defensive linemen Kendall Coleman and Alton Robinson. The Orange held Liberty to minus-four yards rushing on 34 attempts.\n\n\u201cWhat a great challenge,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cThey are really strong in their special teams as well. We expect this to be a very hard, rough game. Any time you get a shutout that is a huge thing.\u201d\n\nJackson threw for 245 yards and four touchdowns with no interceptions against Howard.\n\n\u201cHe started off a little slow,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cHe missed some throws early.\u201d\n\nIt will be the second home game under Locksley, who grew up in Washington and was a former assistant for two stints before he got the head job prior to this season.\n\nMaryland backup quarterback Donny Sanders was a tight end at Syracuse in 2017 before transferring.\n\nSyracuse has several players from the District, including defensive back DuWayne Johnson, wideout Ed Hendrix, defensive back Aman Greenwood, linebacker Juan Wallace, wideout Nykeim Johnson, defensive lineman Caleb Okechukwu. Running back Abdul Adams is from Landover, while offensive lineman Dakota Davis is from Mount Airy.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
