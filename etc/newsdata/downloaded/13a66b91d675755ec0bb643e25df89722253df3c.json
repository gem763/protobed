Initially conceived as a refuge from the modern world, it has enabled the success of tech wizards, whose embrace of the event ironically threatens to undo the humanism Harvey passionately evangelized.\n\nOn the night of the 1986 summer solstice, Larry Harvey and a pal dragged a Jerry-rigged wooden concoction down to Baker Beach in San Francisco and burned it. A handful of others on the beach gathered around the bonfire, and Harvey was so deeply touched by the shared camaraderie of the evening that he decided to do it again the next year. Burning Man was born. By year four, the crowd had grown so large and the effigy so big (40-feet tall) that the police shut down the event.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUndeterred, Harvey and a crew of San Francisco bohemian anarchists called the Cacophonist Society headed to the Black Rock Desert north of Reno, Nev. In the vast space of the desert, they drove vehicles at breakneck speed, fired shotguns from the back of moving pickups and \u2014 as the climax of their camping trip \u2014 engaged in a ceremonial torching of the effigy that provided the whole extravaganza with its name: Burning Man.\n\nIn the years that followed, Burning Man became a phenomenon, as thousands, then tens of thousands, of people flocked to the event. The outrageous visuals of Burning Man attracted media attention: Attendees wore outlandish costumes or ran around naked, branding Burning Man as bacchanalia in the badlands.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, though, something else was going on that the media missed. More than simply bacchanalia and nudity, the event started developing a culture, guided by Harvey\u2019s vision. The culture encouraged radical initiatives while tempering unfettered individual freedom with a shared sense of collective social responsibility. Harvey developed 10 principles to guide the event, not as dogma but as descriptors of how things worked \u2014 a kind of philosophical playbook around which the outlandish culture cohered. These principles held the wild-and-wooly scene together, gave it an architecture and served as guardrails to keep the \u201ccitizens\u201d of Black Rock City from rolling over the cliff.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn contrast to its forebears in the mid-19th century, an era when people were collectively energized through the millennial movements, Burning Man inspired a following without becoming a religion. Harvey thought of himself not as a prophet but a social engineer. His favorite thinker was William James and he embraced ideas from pragmatism in action. As a result, setting out the 10 Principles led to experimentation rather than rigidity.\n\nYet there was one key idea that Harvey adhered to and positioned Burning Man to revolve around: humanism. \u201cSoul\u201d was a word he used frequently to celebrate innate human sentiments that he worried were being stamped out by neoliberal consumption capitalism. Through Burning Man, he shared his confidence that if the innate \u201chumanness\u201d of people prevailed the world would be a better place. His role, he felt, was to create a context where more people could share in a particular version of the human experience.\n\nMany of the attendees embrace Harvey\u2019s humanism and that spirit brings them back to the desert year after year. But there are other Burners, as frequent attendees are called, who enjoy the freedom of the event but who prioritize technology over soul. And as the event has grown in scale, and the tech industry itself has become more powerful in U.S. culture, tech-oriented Burners are having an increasing impact on the culture.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn part because of its home in the Bay Area and its quirky ethos, the tech industry has long had a subculture that embraces Burning Man. In 1996 Wired magazine, the bible of the tech revolution, put the event on the cover, proclaiming it \u201cthe new American holiday.\u201d\n\nThe very first \u201cdoodle\u201d to appear on Google\u2019s home page in 1998 was a stick-figure man that served as an \u201cout-of-the-office\u201d message informing visitors that the entire garage-based company had gone to Burning Man.\n\nThe roster of tech icons who are Burners is legion. Sightings of Jeff Bezos are common. Mark Zuckerberg arrived one year by helicopter. Elon Musk is famously quoted saying \u201cBurning Man is Silicon Valley.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJust this year, Shane Metcalf, co-founder and chief culture officer of 15Five, a digital management feedback platform with clients like MailChimp and the American Red Cross, offered to buy his employees\u2019 tickets: \u201cWe think that going to Burning Man opens your world to higher levels of creativity that you ever knew were possible.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe links between the tech industry and Burning Man are deep. The desert event showcased a collaborative approach to work that the industry has copied. A process now referred to as \u201ccommons-based peer production\u201d in the industry had one of its first iterations at Burning Man. In a scene where \u201ceverybody participates, nobody spectates,\u201d creativity springs forth abundantly. Anybody with the right stuff can contribute to the solution regardless of rank, title or position in the pecking order.\n\nAmong other Silicon Valley firms, Google borrowed heavily from this approach in its governance. On the eve of the company\u2019s IPO, its founders wrote a letter to investors to make sure they understood what they were buying into. The company intended to give their engineers 20 Per Cent Time, free rein to independently pursue projects of their own choosing \u201cworking on what they think will most benefit Google.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe creativity, humanism and ideals about collective social responsibility of Burning Man appealed to engineers and investors who aimed to create new technologies and new ways of seeing the world. Indeed, inspiration from Burning Man\u2019s humanism propelled the early days of Silicon Valley and helped engineers frame their work as making the world a better, more open, place. But as the tech industry became more powerful in U.S. society, its humanist impulses have given way to a different world view.\n\nAD\n\nFor all that Google drew from humanism and the ethos of Burning Man, its engineers also advanced other innovations, like algorithm-driven artificial intelligence \u2014 perhaps the opposite of Harvey\u2019s centering of \u201csoul.\u201d\n\nHarvey himself had deep concerns the growing cult of technology. The final Burning Man theme he produced in 2018 was \u201cI, Robot,\u201d a challenge to his community to ponder the consequences of willingly surrendering their souls to AI machines. \u201cThere are people who want to have chips in their heads,\u201d he lamented to me in our last conversation,\u201d can you imagine that?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAs the annual event in the desert grew in scale, attracting tens of thousands of people, including extremely wealthy tech stars who could fund expensive, exclusive camps at Black Rock, it became a center of power, a place to network and be seen. Harvey\u2019s critiques of neoliberalism, capitalism and consumer culture receded as tech utopianism ascended.\n\nA future where human beings eagerly seek machines to replace themselves was anathema to Harvey\u2019s vision for Burning Man. But, ironically, it was his vision and skill in fashioning an operative humanist culture that helped inspire the very companies that now seek to reduce consciousness to algorithms.\n\nAD", "description": "How the event's humanist roots made way for the tech industry's world view.", "authors": ["Neil Shister", "A Historian Of American Culture", "Is The Author Of The New Book"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/v_-pCmleTocasNtWZmPIQVFCXKk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CHZPZ3BRMAI6RNV5ACCKCZTJQ4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
