Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks at his gubernatorial campaign\u2019s primary night watch party in San Francisco, Tuesday, June 5, 2018. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)\n\nIf you live in either a red or purple state, chances are it\u2019s been subjected to state-funded travel bans from solidly blue states like New York or California.\n\nOftentimes these bans are in response to actions taken by state legislatures who are trying to ensure religious freedoms and/or the rights of women and children (including the unborn) are not infringed upon by militant left wing groups who are paid big bucks to sue businesses and states into oblivion for failure to comply with their radical agendas.\n\nSuch is the case for Iowa, which was added to California\u2019s travel ban list earlier this month by state Attorney General Xavier Becerra:\n\nCalifornia announced last week that it has added Iowa to the list of states on its ever-expanding \u201ctravel ban\u201d list because of that state\u2019s new prohibition against funding gender-transition surgeries under Medicaid.\n\n\n\nThe announcement by state Attorney General Xavier Becerra means that as of Oct. 4, California will no longer offer taxpayer-funded trips to Iowa for any public employee or student at a state-run university.\n\n\n\nBecerra\u2019s authority came from a 2016 California law signed by then-Gov. Jerry Brown that bars state-funded travel to other states that undercut LGBT rights. The blacklist already included Alabama, Kentucky, North Carolina, Texas, Oklahoma and Mississippi.\n\nIowa Governor Kim Reynolds responded appropriately to the news:\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds on Wednesday countered California\u2019s announced ban on taxpayer-funded trips to Iowa by touting the state\u2019s \u201cnice\u201d image as a welcoming place and urging disenchanted California businesses and residents to consider relocating to the Midwest.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nAsked Wednesday about California\u2019s planned travel ban, Reynolds said: \u201cI think the Iowa story is my response. We are knocking it out of the park when it comes to a pro-growth, pro-business environment with opportunities.\u201d\n\n\n\nBy contrast, she said, California is \u201cheading in the wrong direction\u201d with businesses \u201cfleeing\u201d a climate of rising taxes, \u201cskyrocketing\u201d costs to live and do business, and the \u201chighest homeless population\u201d in the nation.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of issues going on in California,\u201d Reynolds said.\n\nIowa is the 11th state to be added to California\u2019s travel ban.\n\nPerhaps the best take on the ban outside of Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s comes from the Babylon Bee, which quipped that other states were \u201cbegging\u201d to be added to California\u2019s travel ban list:\n\nWhile just eleven states are currently on the list, dozens more are applying. Soon, almost every state except Oregon and New York will be on the list, and peace and utopia will break out across the nation as CA politicians will no longer be able to go there and say weird things and do even dumber things.\n\n\n\nThe states were disappointed to learn that the ban didn\u2019t include all Californians, but they said banning just the politicians was a good start, since they\u2019re the ones who ruined the state to begin with.\n\nAll The Other States Beg California To Add Them To Travel Banhttps://t.co/G4XcvGsx29 \u2014 The Babylon Bee (@TheBabylonBee) September 17, 2019\n\n*Chef\u2019s kiss.*\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\n\u2014 Based in North Carolina, Sister Toldjah is a former liberal and a 15+ year veteran of blogging with an emphasis on media bias, social issues, and the culture wars.
