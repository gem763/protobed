The attacks could complicate Aramco\u2019s IPO plans given rising security risks and potential impact on its valuation.\"\n\n\"The U.S. would only release crude from its strategic reserves if damage to infrastructure appears critical or oil prices spike significantly.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSAMUEL CISZUK, FOUNDING PARTNER AT ELS ANALYSIS\n\n\"The outage of 5 million bpd (barrels per day), roughly half of the current Saudi production level and about 5% of global supply, is very large by historic standards. It would in relatively few weeks start to put a stress on the market.\"\n\n\"This incident is a very uncomfortable wake-up call to radically higher risk premiums on Gulf production.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHRISTYAN MALEK, JP MORGAN\n\n\"I'd expect a $3-$5 move in oil prices in the short term. The market has been sleep-walking in risk premium in the region, disproportionately focusing on risk to demand growth and shale oil supply.\"\n\n\"This attack introduces a new, irreversible risk premium into the market.\"\n\nExpects oil to rise to $80-90 a barrel over the next three-six months as the market turns its focus to geopolitics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGARY ROSS, BLACK GOLD INVESTORS\n\n\"The heart of the Saudi oil industry has been successfully attacked so look for prices to rise substantially to $65-$70 per barrel.\"\n\n\"These attacks are difficult to stop and could occur periodically. The market has to price this risk in.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJOHN DRISCOLL, JTD ENERGY\n\n\"This is significant as it takes out twice the volume of the spare capacity in the market, which is at 2.0-2.5 million bpd.\"\n\n\"There\u2019s going to be an initial panic reaction. Anyone who\u2019s hedged on the short side will want to get out quickly. This may cause a significant spike upwards.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTILAK DOSHI, MUSE & STANCIL\n\n\"In the oil universe, this attack is perhaps equivalent to the 9/11 attacks ... Abqaiq is easily the world's single most important oil production and processing infrastructure site.\"\n\n\"This puts Iran's wars-by-proxy in the region squarely in the centre of the security concerns of the Middle East.\"\n\n\"For Asian governments, perhaps this overtakes the perennial concern about the safety of tanker traffic in the Strait of Hormuz with even more serious concerns about the impact of a direct breakout of hostilities between the Saudi alliance and Iran.\"\n\n\"Governments throughout the Asian region will perhaps now be more supportive of the U.S. administration's tough sanctions regime on Iran.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n(Additional reporting by Ahmad Ghaddar and Dmitry Zhdannikov; Writing by Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by Dale Hudson)", "description": "The oil market will rally by $5-10 per barrel when it opens on Monday and may spike to as high as $100 per barrel if Saudi Arabia fails to quickly resume oil supply lost after attacks over the weekend, traders and analysts said.
