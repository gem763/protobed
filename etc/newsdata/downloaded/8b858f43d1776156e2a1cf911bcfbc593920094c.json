I\u2019m aware that as a white male, I don\u2019t go through the same things as a lot of the people that come to the shows.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile he remained fairly tight-lipped about his own identity, Harry clarified his stance as an ally.\n\nHe said: \u2018I can\u2019t claim that I know what it\u2019s like, because I don\u2019t.\u2019\n\nWhat are Harry Styles\u2019 upcoming music plans?\n\nIt goes without saying that Harry\u2019s latest video has set pulses racing across the world.\n\nLights Up, filmed in Mexico, features a drenched and topless Harry, surrounded by sultry, scantily clad boys and girls.\n\nFans had been going wild with speculation earlier this month after they spotted mysterious posters emblazoned with the words: \u2018DO YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE\u2019? This line features heavily in Lights Up, so could the build-up be related to this song, or could a new album be about to drop as well? In November 2018 he told i-D magazine he was working on his second album but has remained pretty tight lipped since. Time will tell! What has Harry Styles done since One Direction split up? Harry has worked with Gucci since 2018 (Picture: Marc Piasecki/GC Images) Following the band\u2019s split, Harry released his first debut solo album in 2017, Sign of the Times.
