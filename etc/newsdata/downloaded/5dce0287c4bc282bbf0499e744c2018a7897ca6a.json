REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo\n\nWhite House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters on Thursday that Trump\u2019s decision to withhold $391 million in aid to Ukraine was linked to his desire for an investigation by Kiev into a debunked theory that a Democratic National Committee (DNC) computer server was held in Ukraine.\n\nAfter weeks in which the president argued that the impeachment probe against him was illegitimate because he had not improperly sought political favors, Mulvaney\u2019s comments, which he subsequently sought to walk back, seemed to undermine the core arguments that Trump and his advisers have made against the effort to oust him from office.\n\n\u201cUnless your ultimate goal is to get to the impeachment vote sooner rather than later, I don\u2019t see how that helps,\u201d said one former administration official with ties to the White House.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s damning in and of itself, but it\u2019s another piece of the puzzle that the Democrats are building and another incident that they can point to of using American foreign policy for private political gain,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski, was quoted in media reports as saying: \u201cYou don\u2019t hold up foreign aid that we had previously appropriated for a political initiative. Period.\u201d\n\nDemocrats in the House of Representatives are holding hearings over concerns that Trump improperly pressured Ukraine to investigate a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. The House could vote on impeachment later this year, which would trigger a trial in the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans.\n\nThe confirmation of a quid pro quo, or favor for a favor, would help bolster Democrats\u2019 arguments that Trump misused his office.\n\nMulvaney later accused the media of misconstruing his comments. But his remarks at the White House, made while the president was traveling in Texas, tied action on the DNC server to the decision about the aid.\n\n\u201cDid he also mention to me ... the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question about that. But that\u2019s it. And that\u2019s why we held up the money,\u201d Mulvaney said in the White House briefing room after explaining that Trump had also been concerned that European nations were not providing lethal aide to Ukraine.\n\nLater in the day, in an effort to conduct damage control, Mulvaney said the withholding of aid was related strictly to Trump\u2019s concerns about corruption and the fact that other nations were not providing financial support to the country.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election. The president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server,\u201d he said in a written statement released by the White House.\n\n\u2018RESORTING TO THE TRUTH\u2019\n\nDemocrats have zeroed in on Trump\u2019s July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which he asked for \u201ca favor\u201d to look into the server as well as the California-based cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which was hired by the DNC in 2016 to investigate hacking of Democratic emails that it later determined was done by Russia.\n\nThe DNC server issue is a discredited claim that Ukraine and not Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election and that a Democratic Party computer server was being held somewhere in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the White House is so desperate they are finally resorting to the truth. The problem is the truth is an admission of the crime,\u201d Democratic Representative Peter Welch said about Mulvaney\u2019s initial comments.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he said that openly is either a brazen admission or they just don\u2019t know the law,\u201d said Democratic Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi.\n\nRepublicans, for their part, expressed concern about the White House\u2019s strategy of getting its messaging across.\n\n\u201cWhether or not there\u2019s any wrongdoing is one thing, but ... the lack of a coordinated messaging effort has made it much more complicated,\u201d said another former administration official, who noted that Mulvaney was unlikely to have conducted the briefing without Trump\u2019s blessing.\n\nThe president said he had confidence in his acting chief of staff.\n\nMulvaney said in the same briefing that the White House had not set up a \u201cwar room\u201d to address the impeachment inquiry because Trump had done nothing wrong.\n\n\u201cJust because you\u2019ve done nothing wrong does not mean you do not need a dedicated committed group of support staff dedicated to making sure that the American people understand that this is a witch hunt and why,\u201d said one Republican with ties to Trump.\n\n\u201cThe president cannot do everything by himself. He needs ... a dedicated team to help him through this.\u201d", "description": "A top White House aide's suggestion that President Donald Trump wanted a political favor from Ukraine in exchange for military aid upended the administration's impeachment strategy and left Republican allies flummoxed and frustrated.", "authors": ["Jeff Mason", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442243971&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H0UZ", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
