They'll begin rolling out in October in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina, with the potential for broader expansion.\n\n\"We believe this program will help our members decrease out-of-pocket costs so they can better manage their budgets and their health,\" Lori Flees, Sam's Club's senior vice president for health and wellness, said in a statement.\n\nWalmart, Sam's Club's parent company, is embarking on a broader push into the $3.5 trillion US healthcare industry, starting with a health clinic in Georgia.

During this week alone, Amazon launched a pilot to give its employees access to virtual and in-home primary care, and Best Buy announced a push into health technology, which it said would be one of its key growth areas.\n\nThe idea of the Sam's Club bundles is to bring \"the complete set of services that are needed for someone to have high-quality basic primary care\" to those who are uninsured, underinsured, or exposed to high healthcare costs because of a high-deductible health plan, 98point6 cofounder and CEO Robbie Cape told Business Insider.\n\n\"So it's really meant to be this sort of comprehensive frontline of care to get people more engaged in their health,\" he said.\n\nSam's Club Care Accelerator bundles range in price from $50 to $240. Sam's Club\n\nAs part of the new pilot, Sam's Club also partnered with Humana to give members access to the health insurer's network of dental providers. The most expensive bundle, which costs $240 a year, is intended for families and covers a screening for early detection of heart disease and diabetes, a discount on hearing aids, and discounts on massage therapy, chiropractors, and acupuncture.\n\nAs tech begins to make an impact on the healthcare industry, facilitating virtual doctor visits and more, the traditional lines of the industry have been in flux, evolving and being redrawn. Companies like Sam's Club clearly see that as an opportunity.", "description": "As the cost of US healthcare continues to rise, the idea is to offer basic healthcare at affordable rates.", "authors": ["Emma Court"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8cdf6b2e22af033723153a?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
