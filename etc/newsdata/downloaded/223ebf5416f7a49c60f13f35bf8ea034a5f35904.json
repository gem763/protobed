The plant-based burger is a great addition to the menu and we are confident that it will prove popular with vegetarians and vegans as well as those who eat meat.\u201d\n\nAccording to Robinson, the company also noted that it's seen a growing demand for vegetarian and vegan meals for young and older customers alike.", "description": "Vegan burgers will now be available at Wetherspoons, as the pub chain starts selling fake-meat burgers from Leeds-based company The Meatless Farm", "authors": ["Molly Holt"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20536229.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_594.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
