There were no reports of damage to Japanese vessels or aircraft travelling in the area.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe strongly condemned the launch and said it was a violation of United Nations resolutions.\n\nThe launches, which were the North's ninth round of weapons tests since late July, came hours after a senior North Korean diplomat on Tuesday evening announced that North Korea and the United States have agreed to resume working-level nuclear negotiations this weekend.\n\nAfter supervising a testing firing of what the North described as a \"newly developed super-large multiple rocket launcher\" last month, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was quoted by state media as saying that the system would require a \"running fire test\" to complete its development.\n\nNorth Korea could also be demonstrating its displeasure over South Korea displaying some of its newly purchased US-made F-35 stealth fighter jets for the first time during its Armed Forces Day ceremony on Tuesday. The North has sharply reacted to the F-35 purchases, calling them a grave provocation that violate recent inter-Korean agreements aimed at lowering military tensions.\n\nAnkit Panda, an adjunct senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists, suggested that additional factors may have prompted the launch, including an attempt at gaining leverage before this weekend\u2019s talks, and a show of force against Japan\u2019s new Aegis Ashore missile defence system.\n\n\u201cOn September 23, 24, and 28, North Korean media featured articles slamming #Japan over Aegis Ashore. That\u2019s part of the context here too,\u201d he tweeted.\n\n\u201cJapanese MoD also made an announcement on Aegis Ashore deployment plans last week. Between the Moon F-35A inspection and this, seems like Kim has enough in-theater to merit signaling-by-missile again.\u201d\n\nNuclear negotiations have been at a standstill for months following a February summit between Kim and President Donald Trump in Hanoi, Vietnam.", "description": "North Korea on Wednesday fired a projectile\u00a0toward its eastern sea, possibly from a submarine, South Korea's military said, in an apparent display of its expanding military capabilities ahead of planned nuclear negotiations with the United States this weekend.
