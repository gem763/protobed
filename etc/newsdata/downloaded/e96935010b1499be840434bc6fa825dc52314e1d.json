With the busiest train station in the world serving the neighborhood, Shinjuku has a constant stream of businesspeople, shoppers, and sightseers coming in and out of the area, and when they get thirsty, there\u2019s block after block of skyscrapers packed with bars and pubs waiting for them.\n\nBut there\u2019s only one bar like Hitori, which is a bar for only one-person groups.\n\nWritten right on the sign on Hitori\u2019s heavy wooden door is a notice saying \u201cA bar limited to parties of one.\u201d So while anyone is welcome, you\u2019ve got to come unaccompanied. Heading out with a date, friend, or coworker? Sorry, you\u2019ll have to find somewhere else to grab a drink.\n\nA look at the street entrance and interior of the seventh-floor Hitori, which means \u201calone\u201d in Japanese.\n\nReporter Mariko, who\u2019s a veteran of such by-herself excursions as a solo sakura party, stopped by Hitori to check it out for, and by, herself. When she arrived, there were about a half-dozen other customers sitting along the counter in Hitori\u2019s cozy, smoke-free interior. She\u2019d imagined that a bar that doesn\u2019t let you bring other people might with you might be a gloomy, oppressively silent place, but to her surprise the customers, who\u2019d all arrived separately, of course, were cheerfully chatting like old friends.\n\nLikewise, the staff was cordial and welcoming. \u201cHello,\u201d the bartender greeted her. \u201cPlease, have a seat here,\u201d he said, while motioning to an empty spot at the bar.\n\nMariko ordered a drink, but wasn\u2019t sure what to do next. Should she jump into the conversation that was already going on, or wait until someone felt like talking to her? Sensing her confusion, the bartender got the ball rolling as he set her drink down in front of her. \u201cIs this your first time here?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow did you find out about us?\u201d\n\nAs Mariko answered, the other customers chimed in with their own stories too, and before Mariko knew it, she\u2019d been folded into their conversation. Rather than being a holding area for individual solitude, Hitori has a laid-back, accepting atmosphere, and the prevailing attitude is \u201cIf someone shows up, we\u2019ll talk with them.\u201d That made Mariko\u2019s evening very different from some of our team\u2019s previous \u201cTokyo alone\u201d experiences, such as drinking alone at a revolving sushi restaurant or spending the night alone in a love hotel. As a matter of fact, aside from those first few nervous moments when she walked through Hitori\u2019s door, Mariko didn\u2019t really feel like she\u2019d spent much time really \u201calone\u201d at all, because of how kind and inclusive everyone was.\n\nA few of the other customers were also first-timers, but there were also some repeat customers in the mix. Mariko asked what it was that everyone liked about the place, and some of their answers were:\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re here, it\u2019s sort of like a mix of being out by yourself and being out with others. It feels just right, and you get to talk with a lot of different people.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt other bars, if I talk to women I don\u2019t know, sometimes they think I\u2019m trying to hit on them and get upset. Here, we all just talk naturally with each other, and it\u2019s easy-going and fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cI go to other bars too, but sometimes there are groups of coworkers sitting next to me. The bosses end up preaching to the others about work, and it\u2019s exhausting to have to hear that. But because everyone here comes by themselves, that sort of thing doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of work, Hitori\u2019s owner had never worked as a bartender prior to opening the bar last year. \u201cBut that means I wasn\u2019t bound by what people usually think a bar should be like,\u201d he says, \u201cand so I was able to think of what kind of place I wanted Hitori to be on my own. I want it to be a bar that offers customers a fun chance to meet new people.\u201d\n\nSo even though Hitori\u2019s unique admission system means it\u2019s unlikely to be a place where everyone knows your name when you sit down, odds are they\u2019ll all know it by the time you leave.\n\nBar information\n\nHitori / \u3072\u3068\u308a\n\nAddress: Tokyo-to, Shinjuku-ku, Kabukicho 2-46-7, Dai-san Hirasawa Building 7th floor\n\n\u6771\u4eac\u90fd\u65b0\u5bbf\u533a\u6b4c\u821e\u4f0e\u753a\uff12\u4e01\u76ee\uff14\uff16\u2212\uff17 \u7b2c\u4e09\u5e73\u6ca2\u30d3\u30eb\uff17\u968e\n\nOpen 7 p.m.-2 a.m. (Monday, Wednesday), 7 p.m.-midnight (Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday), 7 p.m.-5 a.m. (Friday, Saturday)\n\nWebsite\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Solo sakura: Four reasons to have a one-person cherry blossom-viewing party\n\n-- Anime bar Otarabo serves up drinks, passionate discussion about anime with fellow otaku\n\n-- No boys allowed!
