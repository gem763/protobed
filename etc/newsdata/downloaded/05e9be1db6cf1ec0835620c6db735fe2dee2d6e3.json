Class-blind approaches, like carbon taxes, are often regressive and can trigger public backlash (see France\u2019s Yellow Vest protests) that ends up hamstringing climate action. \u201cAny solution that is tied to tangible economic benefits is going to have a better chance of passing,\u201d she told The Times.\n\n\u201cThe war on the climate emergency, if correctly waged, would actually be good for the economy \u2014 just as the second world war set the stage for America\u2019s golden economic era,\u201d writes Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, in The Guardian.\n\nSocial programs are beside the point\n\nGreen New Deal critics say that the plan prioritizes social justice over political reality and even science itself. The plan \u201cretreats into a political fantasy world in which the ideologically median legislator is Bernie Sanders,\u201d Jonathan Chait writes in New York magazine. He points out that the plan is mum on nuclear power, despite a vigorous debate about that technology\u2019s necessity. (Mr. Sanders\u2019s Green New Deal plan, the most ambitious of any candidate\u2019s, explicitly rejects nuclear expansion.) Mr. Chait writes:\n\nWhile rightly insisting on the primacy of climate change, it betrays its own confidence by submerging climate policy into a broader array of priorities \u2026 Thus, at the same time, the plan avoids taking stances that are absolutely vital to reduce carbon emissions, it embraces policies that have nothing to do with climate change whatsoever.\n\nAlong similar lines, The Washington Post\u2019s editorial board notes that the Green New Deal is noncommittal about a carbon tax, which many economists believe is imperative to harnessing market forces to reduce emissions. \u201cPolicymakers should focus above all else on quickly and efficiently decarbonizing,\u201d they write, \u201cand carbon pricing is still the best first-line policy.\u201d\n\nWe need to focus on the rest of the world\n\nThe Green New Deal suffers from domestic myopia, argues Megan McArdle, a libertarian-leaning Washington Post columnist, because the United States produces only 15 percent of the world\u2019s emissions, a share that will only shrink as developing countries industrialize. \u201cZeroing out U.S. emissions and moving the whole country into yurts wouldn\u2019t prevent the climate from warming,\u201d she writes, \u201cbecause Americans are not the biggest problem anymore.\u201d\n\nFor the same reason, Noah Smith, a left-leaning Bloomberg columnist, agrees with the spirit, but not the letter, of the Green New Deal. The priority, he writes, is to \u201cpour money\u201d into researching green technology and then transferring and subsidizing it across the world:\n\nThe climate change battle will be won or lost in developing countries such as China \u2026 If the U.S. can discover cheap ways of manufacturing cement and concrete without carbon emissions, and of reducing emissions from agriculture, it will give developing countries a way to reduce carbon output without threatening their economic growth.\n\nWe need a technological breakthrough\n\nElizabeth Kolbert, a staff writer at The New Yorker and the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of \u201cThe Sixth Extinction,\u201d has written that the amount of carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere has most likely locked the planet into another half degree of warming. The 1.5-degree target may therefore be impossible unless emissions can be reversed.", "description": "Some Democratic candidates say it could be the only way to save the planet.", "authors": ["Spencer Bokat-Lindell"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/03/opinion/03GNDIllo/03GNDIllo-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
