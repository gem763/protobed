Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) called on Twitter Monday to suspend President Donald Trump\u2019s account, saying he\u2019s using the social media platform to incite violence against the whistleblower who triggered an impeachment inquiry and members of Congress leading the probe.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of \u2026 evidence to suggest that he is irresponsible with his words in a way that could result in harm to other people,\u201d Harris told Anderson Cooper on CNN\u2019s \u201c360.\u201d \u201cSo the privilege of using those words in that way should probably be taken from him.\u201d\n\nPres. Trump's \"Twitter account should be suspended,\" says Kamala Harris.\n\n\n\n\"There's plenty of\u2026evidence to suggest that he is irresponsible with his words in a way that could result in harm\u2026so the privilege of using those words in that way should probably be taken from him.\" pic.twitter.com/k5SYGCuwX1 \u2014 Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0 (@AC360) October 1, 2019\n\nTrump has repeatedly attacked the whistleblower, and on Twitter Monday suggested House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) should be arrested for \u201ctreason.\u201d\n\nRep. Adam Schiff illegally made up a FAKE & terrible statement, pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the Ukrainian President, and read it aloud to Congress and the American people. It bore NO relationship to what I said on the call. Arrest for Treason? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2019\n\nOn Sunday the president raised the possibility of national violence by quoting a right-wing pastor who warned of a \u201cCivil War-like fracture\u201d if Trump is removed from office.\n\n....If the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they will never be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.\u201d Pastor Robert Jeffress, @FoxNews \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2019\n\nHarris said the president\u2019s \u201ctweets and his behaviors about this are just further evidence of the fact that he uses his power in a way that is designed to beat people down instead of lift people up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you look at what he\u2019s been tweeting ... directed at the whistleblower ... I frankly think that based on this and all we\u2019ve seen before, including attacking members of Congress, that ... his Twitter account should be suspended,\u201d Harris said.\n\nIn a meeting with supporters last week, Trump called the whistleblower and his White House sources \u201cclose to a spy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now,\u201d Trump said, apparently alluding to physical harm or death.\n\nShortly after those remarks, a Trump-supporting group offered a $50,000 reward to anyone who could identify the whistleblower. The whistleblower\u2019s attorney wrote to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire Saturday, saying Trump\u2019s comments and the reward had raised concerns for his client\u2019s safety.\n\nThe Whistleblower Protection Act prohibits federal agencies from threatening retaliation against individuals who raise concerns about wrongdoing in the government.\n\nA Twitter representative couldn\u2019t be reached for comment after normal business hours. Its policies bar harassment, as well as incitement to harm or violence.\n\n\u201cYou may not engage in the targeted harassment of someone, or incite other people to do so,\u201d Twitter\u2019s rules against harassment say. \u201cThis includes wishing or hoping that someone experiences physical harm.\u201d", "description": "The 2020 Democratic candidate told CNN's Anderson Cooper that Trump's \"irresponsible\" words \"could result in harm to other people.\"", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d92ee0d2200003300dbb414.png?cache=xfznbiquh7&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
