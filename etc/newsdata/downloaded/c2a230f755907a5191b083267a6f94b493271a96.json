They all turned in unison, their eyes popping out like cartoons.\n\nI\u2019m always surprised at these comments \u2013 people seem to forget that I am a person with feelings, not an inanimate Barbie.\n\nHowever, as I am all too aware, when your breasts are big, you\u2019re automatically sexualised.\n\nI\u2019ve been told, \u2018Well hide them if you don\u2019t want the attention!\u2019 But no woman with big breasts is ever \u2018asking for attention\u2019 \u2013 believe me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirstly, have you tried to hide 34GG breasts? It is impossible. But more importantly, why should we have to hide our breasts in the first place? It\u2019s not a woman\u2019s responsibility to hide her breasts and change her clothes in social spaces for fear of attracting the wrong attention and unsolicited comments on her body.\n\nIt is totally not OK to comment on someone\u2019s body without anyone asking for your opinion \u2013 and it isn\u2019t only men who do this.\n\nWomen have told me in bathrooms on nights out that \u2018I\u2019m so lucky\u2019 and compare their boobs to mine in the mirror.\n\nHaving big breasts is not a choice or a luxury (Picture: Jackie Adedeji)\n\nThey tell me they have fried eggs and wish I could donate my breast fat to them so they can feel \u2018sexy\u2019.\n\nSure, it\u2019s very sexy when you think you\u2019re having severe chest pains on the tube and want to press the emergency stop \u2013 then realise it\u2019s because yet another metal underwire has popped out of your bra and is striking you in the chest. Another \u00a350 bra down the drain then!\n\nHaving big breasts is not a choice or a luxury \u2013 it\u2019s how I was born.\n\nAt 11 years old my breasts were already 30FF. Mum took me to get my boobs measured and I was given a white frilly bra that looked like something my grandmother wore. \u2018It will give you all the support you need,\u2019 mum said as she smiled. I frowned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt school, my classmates got to change for P.E. in the classroom with the boys but the teacher told me my body was \u2018too mature\u2019 so I had to get changed in the bathroom. It made me feel like I was an alien, like I was abnormal.\n\nI was a child who looked like a woman. There were so many items of clothing I could never wear because, according to relatives and family friends, I looked \u2018too promiscuous\u2019. I know they meant well but now I\u2019m older, I realise how sad it is to make a child change what they were wearing to stop attention.\n\nReally we should be asking why people are sexualising breasts on a child in the first place?\n\nToday porn plays a huge role in the way we view breasts. \u2018Big breasts\u2019 is a commonly searched-for porn category and a sexual fetish on its own. Breasts have become a sexual commodity and it almost feels I have become one too.\n\nLast year I even considered breast reduction surgery for the first time. I was finally ready to be free of the issues my breasts bring with them.\n\nFor the rest of my life I\u2019ll always constantly be worried that someone is staring at me for all the wrong reasons (Picture: Jackie Adedeji)\n\nI went for a private consultation only to find that surgery would cost around \u00a37,000. I\u2019m 25 and rent in London, so that thought went down the drain quickly.\n\nFree breast reduction surgery is available on the NHS but there are long waiting times and the eligibility criteria is very tight. Russell Bramhall, a consultant at the burn plastic surgery unit at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, told the Guardian this year that women getting the surgery are almost at the mercy of a postcode lottery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith reduction off the table, I know I will spend the rest of my life dealing with the cost of bras, which are so much more expensive for us well-endowed ladies. We need more choice and more assistance finding bras that fit properly.\n\nAnd for the rest of my life I\u2019ll always constantly be worried that someone is staring at me for all the wrong reasons.\n\nIn the meantime, however, I am teaching myself to love and embrace my melons.\n\nWomen with big breasts should feel free to express ourselves like everyone else. I know the experience is not the same for everyone but I hope to be an example that if you\u2019re a GG or a JJ, you\u2019re still beautiful like everyone else.\n\nLike Sophia Loren said, nothing makes a woman more beautiful than the belief that she is beautiful. Easier said then done, but I\u2019m ready to practise.\n\nMORE: Woman who spent 20 years hiding amputated leg finally learns to love her body\n\nMORE: I don\u2019t want the fashion industry to use \u2018token\u2019 models, I want inclusivity\n\nMORE: Lizzo makes me proud to be a plus-size black woman\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Jackie Adedeji tells Metro.co.uk about the sexual harassment she receives for having big breasts.", "authors": ["Jackie Adedeji"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jackie-1-9d48_1570280002.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
