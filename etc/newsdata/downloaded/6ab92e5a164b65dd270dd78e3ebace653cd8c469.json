The exception is if he can convince parliament to leave without a deal in place which seems unlikely.\n\nUK Services Sector Activity Contracts for First Time in 3 Years\n\nThe services sector, which accounts for the largest part of the economy, was reported to contract in September, signaling worries of a recession.\n\nIHS Markit reported jobs in the service sector were cut last month at the fastest pace in nine years. Further, the Future Activity index declined to a more than three year low, weakening expectations for activity.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nDespite the poor economic data and disappointing Brexit progress, GBP/USD is catching a bit of a bid on Thursday. The pair is benefiting from some dollar weakness which has led to a two-day recovery in EUR/USD.\n\nGBPUSD 4-Hour Chart More\n\nFor most of the week, I\u2019ve been focused on support at 1.2287. This level confluences with the 200 moving average on a 4-hour chart. While the pair dipped below it earlier in the week, it has managed to climb above it at this stage.\n\nFurther, GBP/USD has also broken upward from a downtrend channel. This signals the potential for a bit of a recovery.\n\nGBPUSD Daily Chart More\n\nI\u2019m looking for a rally towards resistance at 1.2373. The 20-day moving average has converged towards the level to create a confluence. For this reason, I think this is an area that will hold sellers.\n\nBottom Line\n\nJohnson\u2019s proposal still needs a lot of work and time is running out in reaching a Brexit agreement.\n\nGBP/USD has held above important support and there\u2019s potential for a recovery.\n\nA horizontal level at 1.2373 carries confluence with the 20 DMA to create a resistance confluence for recoveries.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "GBP/USD has recovered back above an important support area and is breaking higher from a downward trend channel, suggesting a recovery might take place.", "authors": ["Jignesh Davda"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BigyD5UFrP9MpB6715qjaA--~B/aD0zMzQ7dz04MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/c4d76192f62c4b3add5505ea704cb2fa", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
