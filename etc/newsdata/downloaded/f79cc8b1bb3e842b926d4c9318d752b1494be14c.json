Borders are 19th-century holdovers. The European Union, not the US Constitution, is seen as the preferable model to run a nation.\n\nThe media can no longer afford to be nonpartisan and impartial in its effort to rid America of a reactionary such as Trump, given his danger to the progressive future.\n\nAmerica\u2019s ancient sins can never really be forgiven. In a new spirit of iconoclasm, thousands of buildings, monuments and statues dedicated to American sinners of the past must be destroyed, removed or renamed.\n\nA new America supposedly is marching forward under the banner of ending fossil fuels, curbing the Second Amendment, redistributing income, promoting identity politics and open borders and providing free college, free health care and abortion on demand.\n\nAn insomniac Trump fights all of the above nonstop and everywhere. In the past, Republican presidents sought to slow the progressive transformation of America but despaired of ever stopping it.", "description": "", "authors": ["V.D.
