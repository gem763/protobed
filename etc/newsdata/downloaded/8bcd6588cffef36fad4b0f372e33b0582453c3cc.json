We\u2019re still waiting for that to happen \u2014 the app is in beta testing at the moment \u2014 but it seems Adobe is charging ahead with plans to bring more of its Creative Cloud software to Apple\u2019s tablet, as Bloomberg now reports the next Adobe CC app for the iPad will be Illustrator.\n\nAccording to the report, Adobe may preview Illustrator for iPad at its Adobe Max conference in early November and plans to launch the full version some time in 2020. The app is expected to \u201cmirror\u201d many features from the desktop version of Illustrator, Bloomberg says, which sounds a lot like what Adobe said it would be doing with Photoshop.\n\nIllustrator on iPad may launch in 2020\n\nHowever, Photoshop for iPad may not be all that was promised when it finally launches, as last week, Bloomberg reported that betas of Photoshop for iPad are apparently missing some features and other key functions from the desktop version. Adobe\u2019s Scott Belsky, chief product officer of the company\u2019s Creative Cloud group, told the publication that Adobe would \u201cexpand the capabilities\u201d of Photoshop on iPad over time.\n\nToday, Daring Fireball\u2019s John Gruber wrote that \u201cmultiple reliable sources\u201d say Adobe is \u201cgenuinely all-in\u201d on Photoshop for iPad and that the team plans to \u201cadd features iteratively on an aggressive schedule. So perhaps features missing at launch will show up in the app soon after, as Belsky promised.\n\nBloomberg reported last week that Adobe may provide an update on Photoshop for iPad at its Max conference, so we likely won\u2019t have to wait much longer to learn more about Adobe\u2019s plans.", "description": "Last fall, Adobe announced that \"real Photoshop\" would be coming to the iPad sometime this year.
