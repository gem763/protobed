Custodians generally charge a small percentage of the assets they hold\u2014up to about 0.5%.\n\nFor cryptocurrencies, the role of custodian is especially important, since all a thief or hacker needs to steal cryptocurrency is the string of private keys, or codes, assigned to that specific asset.\n\nAs a result, a roster of companies ranging from fintech startups to some of the biggest names in the financial-services industry are now competing to play the role of cryptocurrency custodians.\n\nCompanies fighting for this business include custody providers BitGo Inc. and Anchorage Trust Co. and cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase, Gemini and Paxos.\n\nLarger companies are showing interest, too. Fidelity Investments now offers custody services through Fidelity Digital Assets. And New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc. ICE 1.49% is developing a bitcoin futures platform and in April acquired Digital Asset Custody Co.\n\nStamp of legitimacy?\n\nEstablishing a supply of trusted custodians could help pave the way for bigger institutions to invest in cryptocurrencies. There has long been uncertainty about regulatory requirements and the logistics of holding digital assets. After some well-known digital-token thefts, cryptocurrencies face a perception that they aren\u2019t safe, since a hacker attack or security misstep could mean losing your coins forever. Thus, secure custody practices not only address the custody requirements for registered investment advisers but also could offer a stamp of legitimacy for cryptocurrencies.\n\nCurrently smaller individual crypto investors don\u2019t typically need the more expensive and more involved security procedures that custody services provide. But with the growth of custody services for institutions, many of their techniques and services will eventually become more widely and inexpensively available to individual investors, some providers say.\n\n\u201cEventually it will move to the consumer side,\u201d says Paul Veradittakit, a partner at early crypto investor Pantera Capital. \u201cCustody providers are targeting institutional entities because that is where the money is, but eventually it will get down to consumers. Hopefully then everyone can have that peace of mind.\u201d\n\nTotal cryptocurrency funds going into companies focusing exclusively on custody have totaled nearly $13 billion since 2016, including close to $2.5 billion already this year, according to research firm Chainalysis. This doesn\u2019t include major exchanges, which also have custody companies or units.\n\nHot and cold\n\nOwnership of cryptocurrencies is designated by public and private \u201ckeys\u201d that are long strings of numbers and letters. Any person with the private key can initiate a transaction\u2014thus the heightened vulnerability to loss and theft.\n\nCustodians are working on the best ways to secure private keys, and one of the major differences in approach among competitors is whether keys are stored online or offline\u2014a choice between \u201chot wallets\u201d or \u201ccold storage,\u201d as the two methods are referred to, respectively, in the industry.\n\nCold storage makes a key virtually inaccessible to hackers. It keeps the code stored on a device that isn\u2019t accessible from the internet\u2014the equivalent of writing the code down on a piece of paper and storing it in a physical vault that a person must access before they can transfer the key online. The downside is that this necessarily slows down access times, sometimes to as much as 24 hours. After a client requests access, the custodian authenticates it as a legitimate request, then typically sends the instruction to its employees at a separate location, where the vault containing the assets is.\n\nA \u201chot wallet,\u201d by contrast, is a type of bitcoin wallet that is connected to the internet. The customer uses a traditional password to access their crypto, and the exchange where the customer trades their cryptocurrency holds the keys. But the keys can be accessed online (by the customer, or by a hacker if they get the password). Hot wallets enable faster access for trading, and many consumer crypto exchanges use them to store customers\u2019 crypto funds.\n\nBut hot wallets can be compromised. In May, Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, said hackers stole more than $40 million in an attack.\n\nBitGo, Coinbase Custody, Gemini, Paxos, Fidelity and other companies use cold storage for institutional clients. BitGo, which started out offering hot wallets, has expanded to providing custody and other services for institutional investors.\n\nDifferent approaches\n\nSome other companies have taken different approaches. Anchorage has developed technology\u2014which it says is different from cold storage\u2014to keep crypto keys disconnected from the internet but still accessible quickly. It does this by using specialized hardware that automates the process of accessing the keys. This eliminates human access and reduces human error, says Nathan McCauley, co-founder and chief executive at Anchorage.\n\nMr. McCauley says his company still uses humans to review transactions before they are sent. With Anchorage\u2019s system, transactions can be done in as little as a few minutes, he says.\n\n\u201cCold storage tends to devolve into a human process,\u201d says Mr. McCauley. \u201cThose processes humans follow are subject to error. Individual humans type in pass phrases unlocking assets; it means it\u2019s fundamentally subject to human error.\u201d\n\nMike Belshe, co-founder and chief executive of BitGo, believes that speed isn\u2019t always good. Large customers \u201cdon\u2019t want you to move $100 million in a few minutes,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you can [move it that fast], you\u2019re subject to coercion. In our opinion the prudent thing to do today is use a combination of hot and cold storage.\u201d For clients who need to access assets quickly, Mr. Belshe recommends keeping a portion of cryptocurrency in a hot wallet for faster access and the rest in cold storage for maximum security.\n\nCoinbase Custody, according to CEO Sam McIngvale, uses cold storage and involves \u201cmultiple humans reviewing details of transactions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also think people remain an important piece of this puzzle,\u201d he says.\n\nMr. Geron is a Wall Street Journal reporter in San Francisco.
