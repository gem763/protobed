Over five decades of celebrated journalism, Cokie shone a powerful light on the unsung women heroes who built our nation, but whose stories had long gone untold. As she helped tell the full story of America\u2019s history, she helped shape its future \u2013 inspiring countless young women and girls to follow in her groundbreaking footsteps.\"\n\n\"Her warmth, wit and wisdom will be deeply missed by all,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\n\u201cMichelle and I are sad to hear about the passing of Cokie Roberts,\u201d President Barack Obama said in a statement. \u201cShe was a trailblazing figure; a role model to young women at a time when the profession was still dominated by men; a constant over forty years of a shifting media landscape and changing world, informing voters about the issues of our time and mentoring young journalists every step of the way.\u201d\n\nRoberts covered the Bush political family for years, and as the world mourned the death of President George H.W. Bush in December, Roberts credited his family as one that \u201ccares about public service.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened that Cokie Roberts is no longer with us,\u201d President George Bush released in a statement. \u201cShe covered us for decades as a talented, tough, and fair reporter. We respected her drive and appreciated her humor. She became a friend.\u201d\n\nTerry Ashe/ABC\n\nRoberts won countless awards, including three Emmys, throughout her decades-long career. She has been inducted into the Broadcasting and Cable Hall of Fame and was cited by the American Women in Radio and Television as one of the 50 greatest women in the history of broadcasting. She was named a \"Living Legend\" by the Library of Congress in 2008.\n\n\"No one understood the Congress and Washington better than Cokie Roberts,\" tweeted Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, a top Republican in the Senate. \"She was a great reporter, a tireless volunteer for good causes, and a valued friend.\"\n\nLouisiana GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy told ABC News that he felt a \"sense of loss\" upon learning about the loss of Roberts, a New Orleans native.\n\n\"She loved our state, loved our country. And I'm very sorry for her family and, and for all those who followed her,\u201d Cassidy said.\n\n\"Cokie Roberts was one of the founding mothers of journalism in this country and a representative of the highest standards in the field,\" Democratic Rep.
