London\u2019s main transportation regulator, Transport for London, granted Uber a two-month license on Tuesday instead. That\u2019s among the shortest terms the agency has ever granted.\n\nThe back story. Uber was running on a 15-month probationary license in London, which was set to expire before midnight on Wednesday. The Silicon Valley giant was rejected by the TfL in 2017 for a renewal of its private-hire license on concerns of potential public safety and governance issues related to data breaches, crime reporting, and drivers\u2019 background checks.\n\nIn June 2018, British judge Emma Arbuthnot granted Uber a short-term license for 15 months\u2014instead of the usual five-year term\u2014after the ride-sharing company made some changes to its operation and promised to commit to the 14 conditions laid out by the TfL, including board composition, compliance protocol, and criminal reporting policy.\n\nWhat's new. Ahead of the expiration of Uber\u2019s 15-month license, TfL said on Tuesday it still needed to conduct more review on the company before considering any potential longer-term license and only gave the company a two-month permit instead.\n\nThe new two-month license will have the same conditions that Uber has been subject to over the last 15 months, according to a TfL statement, along with new conditions to ensure passenger safety. The new conditions cover ride sharing, appropriate insurance and driver document checks by Uber.\n\n\u201cTfL\u2019s original decision not to license [Uber London Limited] has led to the app-based firm improving its culture and governance,\u201d wrote the regulator in the statement, \u201cTfL is requesting additional material from [Uber London Limited] and this additional information will help inform any future licensing decision.\u201d\n\nJamie Heywood, Uber\u2019s regional general manager for Northern & Eastern Europe, said the company will continue to work closely with the regulator and provide any additional information needed.\n\n\u201cOver the past two years, we\u2019ve launched a range of new safety features in the app, introduced better protections for drivers and our Clean Air Plan is helping to tackle air pollution,\u201d said Heywood, \u201cWe will keep listening, learning and improving to provide the best service while being a trusted partner to London.\u201d\n\nLooking Ahead. The prolonged periods of regulatory scrutiny is the latest setback for Uber, as CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has been trying to repair the company\u2019s relations with global regulators. \u201cWe are trying our best to be excellent partners with TfL,\u201d Khosrowshahi said during a call with investors in August.\n\nLondon\u2014with roughly 45,000 drivers and almost four million monthly riders using Uber\u2019s service\u2014has been one of the company\u2019s biggest markets. A few competitors in the ride-sharing industry, including Estonia\u2019s Bolt, India\u2019s Ola, and Israel\u2019s Gett, have recently entered the London market and granted short-term permits as well.\n\nIn the event of an unfavorable ruling where the license is terminated, Uber will likely challenge the decision in court like it did in 2017, the company said in its latest filing.\n\nWrite to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.com", "description": "Uber Technologies stock dropped over 5% on Tuesday as the ride-sharing company lost its latest effort to secure a long-term operating license in London\u2014one of the company\u2019s most important markets.", "authors": ["Evie Liu"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-110519/social", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
