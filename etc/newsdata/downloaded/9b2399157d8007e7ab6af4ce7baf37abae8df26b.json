Tens of thousands of Eritreans flee their small Horn of Africa country every year, citing political repression and lengthy military conscription.\n\nOfficials from the U.N. refugee agency in Uganda and the prime minister\u2019s office told Reuters they had not received asylum requests from the five players.\n\nThe five men disappeared from their hotel in the eastern town of Jinja on Sunday after playing a match in the quarter finals of a three-week regional tournament.\n\n\u201cThe search is going on, we notified security, they are trying to trace them,\u201d Rogers Mulindwa, spokesman for Council of East and Central Africa Football Association, which organised the tournament, told Reuters.\n\nMulindwa said they had intensified security measures around the 13 remaining Eritrean team members to prevent more players from disappearing.\n\nIn 2012, 14 members of the Eritrea soccer squad disappeared while playing in the same tournament in Uganda. The U.N. refugee agency, the UNHCR, said it did not have an immediate answer on whether those players had applied for asylum in Uganda or moved to another country.\n\nThe United Nations says Eritrea is the world\u2019s ninth largest source of refugees, with at least 507,300 refugees registered at the end of 2018.\n\nIn August, international rights group Human Rights Watch said Eritrea was still forcing thousands of students and teachers into indefinite national service, frustrating hopes that last year\u2019s peace deal with former archenemy Ethiopia might lead to scaled back conscription.", "description": "Ugandan security forces are hunting for five Eritreans who disappeared from a hotel in Uganda where their team was playing in a soccer tournament, a Ugandan official said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Elias Biryabarema", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
