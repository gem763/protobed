As a black player, we've heard it for many years about walking off. It's something you don't want to do because you do need your white players to do that for you, so you can go off together, how powerful it is, that will do something.\"\n\nThe former Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane also said on the ITV broadcast that it made him \"feel sick to his stomach.\"\n\nThe English Football Association (FA), the governing body for football in England, tweeted that its players were \"subjected to abhorrent racist chanting\" during the match, adding: \"This is unacceptable at any level of the game.\"\n\nWe can confirm that @England players were subjected to abhorrent racist chanting while playing in the #EURO2020 qualifier against Bulgaria. This is unacceptable at any level of the game and our immediate focus is supporting the players and staff involved. \u2014 The FA (@FA) October 14, 2019\n\nThe Levski Stadium was already partially closed on the night after Bulgaria was sanctioned over allegations of racist behaviour during games against Kosovo and the Czech Republic last week.\n\nThe England and Chelsea FC striker Tammy Abraham had told reporters ahead of the match that the England team would walk off the pitch on the night should any of the players be subject to racial abuse, according to The Telegraph.\n\nHowever, the 22-year-old's announcement came under scrutiny from many, including the former Liverpool football player turned Guardian columnist Howard Gayle, who suggested that \"racism wins\" if England walked off.\n\nUEFA has a three-step protocol directed at tackling racist behaviour, which involves first stopping the match, followed by a stadium announcement before eventually calling the game off.\n\nShould England have broken the protocol, it would have faced possible sanctions. England won 6-0 on the night, thanks to goals from Marcus Rashford, Ross Barkley (2), Raheem Sterling (2), and Harry Kane.\n\nEngland's next match is a November 14 Euro 2020 qualifier against Montenegro.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "England\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifier against Bulgaria was stopped twice in the first half after complaints of racism.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2839/cb38b83f142c40ccaae7b07b11631030.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
