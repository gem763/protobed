But during this two-day period, MPs - not the government - will have the opportunity to reject the EU's date.", "description": "The prime minister says he deplores threats to MPs, adding that \"tempers need to come down\" in Parliament.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07pdfbk.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
