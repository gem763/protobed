Immigration is one of the issues that President Donald Trump campaigned on, claiming that \u201cthe country is full\u201d and arguing for a border wall. While Trump and the Republican Party don\u2019t like immigration in general, they tend to agree that legal immigration is acceptable, or as Sen. Ted Cruz summed up, \u201cLegal good, illegal bad.\u201d As a legal immigrant, Oliver shared his insights and debunked many of the myths behind the complicated and convoluted system.\n\nFirst, there are country caps for most types of \u201cgreen cards\u201d that allow for lawful permanent residency. These numerical caps limit the number of people coming from any one country, which in effect, Oliver explains, means the same number of people can immigrate from big countries like China as from tiny Malta. In addition to the country caps, there are four main routes to permanent residency or citizenship, according to Oliver: family, employment, good luck (visa lottery) and bad luck (asylum).\n\nOne of the main ways that people can legally immigrate to the U.S. is when citizens sponsor close family relatives (children, parents or spouses). It\u2019s what Trump calls \u201cchain migration\u201d and supports limiting, although, as Oliver notes, Melania Trump sponsored her parents to come live in the U.S.\n\nAnother pathway is through work visas, which is how Oliver first came to the U.S. Oliver explains that he is in the U.S. on an O-1 Visa \u201cwhich is for person with extraordinary ability in the arts\u201d\u2014and yes, Oliver knows what you are thinking and has a two word retort for you. Work visas are usually only temporary, though. \u201cThink of getting a work visa as getting a backstage pass to see BTS,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cSure it will allow you to hang around a bit, but you\u2019re probably not going to end up becoming part of the band.\u201d Oliver explained that before he got his green card, he was stuck in \u201cendless costly hoops\u201d, forced to leave the U.S. every 11 months, and \u201cconstantly worried\u201d that he wouldn\u2019t be able to come back. When he finally got a green card he nearly burst into tears because he had been so worried for so long.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

In 2017, 22 million people applied, they were all are vetted, and then only 50,000 were chosen. \u201cYour odds of winning that lottery to come into the country are about the same as your odds of getting shot once you get here,\u201d Oliver said.\n\nFinally, refugees and asylum seekers (a.k.a. those with bad luck) are able to apply for legal immigration. Historically, the U.S. has led the world in terms of accepting more refugees annually than any other country. That has changed under Trump, though, whose administration is reportedly weighing whether to cut the number of refugees to zero next year, which Oliver notes is \u201ca level of indifference to human suffering rivaled only by robots and housecats.\u201d\n\nThe Trump Administration is cutting all of the options for legal immigration, resulting in what some advocates call \u201cthe invisible wall\u201d. If you\u2019re going to tell people to \u201cget in line\u201d to be a legal immigrant, Oliver said, \u201cyou should at least make sure they actually have a line to stand in.\u201d According to Oliver, if Trump has his way the only people who will be able to come to the U.S. are \u201crich Norwegians and future wives.\u201d\n\nWatch John Oliver on Last Week Tonight below.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "As a legal immigrant, Oliver shared his insights and debunked many of the myths behind the convoluted system", "authors": ["Melissa Locker"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/john_oliver_last_week_tonight_era.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C10px%2C1024px%2C536px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
