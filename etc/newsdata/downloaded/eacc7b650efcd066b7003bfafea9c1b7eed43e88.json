Jonathan Glueckert/University of Florida\n\nYou\u2019ve seen the ads flooding television and social media: \u201cHave you been exposed to weed killer Roundup? If you have cancer, you may be eligible for compensation. Call our law offices \u2026 \u201d\n\nIn 2018 and 2019, California juries ordered Roundup\u2019s producer, Monsanto, to pay multimillion-dollar compensations to four non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients who claimed to have been sickened by Roundup (one of dozens of formulations with herbicide glyphosate as the active ingredient). As a result, there are now close to 20,000 lawsuits against the company from people who also allege that exposure to Roundup gave them cancer.\n\nThe California verdicts will almost certainly be overturned on appeal because they were based on the alleged failings of Monsanto, not on any scientific evidence that Roundup causes cancer. Follow-up suits that aren\u2019t settled are likely to fail, too.\n\nAll scientific bodies that have seriously studied glyphosate report no link to cancer. These include the World Health Organization. But WHO\u2019s loosely connected appendage\u2014the International Agency for Research on Cancer\u2014postulates a \u201cprobable\u201d link. Instead of studying glyphosate, it reviewed existing studies of the herbicide. Based on this 2015 review, IARC placed glyphosate on its \u201c2A List\u201d of substances with \u201climited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals\u201d or, in IARC\u2019s abbreviated translation, \u201cprobably carcinogenic.\u201d That list also includes \u201cvery hot beverages\u201d and \u201cred meat.\u201d\n\nLee Van Wychen, executive director of science policy for the National and Regional Weed Science Societies, offers this: \u201cIARC\u2019s review was such a crooked scam! I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. \u2026 IARC cherry-picked a couple studies and on top of that fudged the results of those studies. They did these odds-ratio calculations\u2014a correlation, not even a mechanistic cause\u2014of how glyphosate might cause cancer. Now there are people on the conservation side who are afraid to use glyphosate.\u201d\n\nVan Wychen assesses the studies IARC reviewed that supposedly indicate \u201csufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals\u201d as follows: \u201cThey dosed rats with glyphosate to the point they couldn\u2019t even stand up straight.\u201d On Oct. 19, 2017, Reuters reported that IARC \u201cdismissed and edited findings from a draft of its review of the weed killer glyphosate that were at odds with its final conclusion.\u201d\n\nThe California verdicts, the lawyer feeding frenzy, and Roundup hysteria all issued from IARC\u2019s speculation.\n\nThe week IARC published its minority opinion the review\u2019s leader, Christopher Portier, signed on as a litigation consultant for counsel suing Monsanto on behalf of alleged glyphosate cancer victims. He reportedly received $450 per hour.\n\nCalifornia responded to the IARC review by ordering that all glyphosate products carry a cancer warning. On Feb. 26, 2018, a federal judge struck down the requirement, ruling it \u201cinherently misleading \u2026 when apparently all other regulatory and governmental bodies have found the opposite.\u201d\n\nAn airboat applicator treating invasive West Indian marsh grass on a Florida lake. The most effective herbicides for this invasive plant are glyphosate and imazapyr. Stephen F. Enloe, University of Florida Agronomy Department/Center for Aquatic and Invasive Plants\n\nWhen I inform people that glyphosate doesn\u2019t cause cancer, I tend to get responses like: \u201cOK, drink a glass.\u201d I could, with impunity. It\u2019s a plant poison that passes harmlessly through human digestive tracts. \u201cLD50\u201d stands for the lethal dose that kills half the test animals when given to them in doses per unit of body mass. Higher is safer. For rats, caffeine\u2019s LD50 is 192 mg/kg.\n\nGlyphosate\u2019s is 5,600 mg/kg.\n\nYet, some environmental groups are calling for a total ban on glyphosate, and many are recycling the untruth that it\u2019s carcinogenic. These include the Environmental Working Group, Center for Biological Diversity, Natural Resources Defense Council, EcoWatch, Greenpeace, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, Sierra Club, and Friends of the Earth.\n\nThat they hate Monsanto is understandable. The company produces and promotes truly dangerous products like neonicotinoid insecticides (which poison pollinators) and genetically modified crops that are immune to Roundup and allow agribusiness to blitz entire plantations, weeds and all. When Roundup (or any chemical) is overused like this there can be environmental damage.\n\n\u201cWhen you apply the same herbicide on 200 million acres multiple times a year, a few weeds are gonna get lucky and then pass on their resistance,\u201d says Van Wychen.\n\nThese \u201csuper weeds\u201d then require more dangerous herbicides like Monsanto\u2019s Dicamba, which can drift long distances. In 2018, it killed crops on hundreds of Midwest farms. There\u2019s also evidence that massive doses of glyphosate applied to ag land can limit amphibians and such insects as milkweed-dependent monarch butterflies.\n\nAnd the blast-everything approach to ag-land weed management enabled by Monsanto\u2019s GMOs has resulted in trace amounts of glyphosate showing up in cereal, wine and beer. They\u2019re small amounts that don\u2019t affect human health, but I don\u2019t blame consumers for objecting.\n\n\u201cI get pissed off at Monsanto myself,\u201d says Van Wychen. But none of this makes glyphosate a carcinogen.\n\nGlyphosate treatment of phragmites infestation at Assateague Island National Seashore. Assateague Island National Seashore\n\nHere\u2019s why protecting the proper, responsible uses of glyphosate matters so much (and should matter to the very organizations that want the herbicide off the market): A total ban on all glyphosate use would be an unmitigated disaster for fish and wildlife. Glyphosate is the most effective tool, often the only tool, wildland and aquatic managers have for restoring fish and wildlife habitats destroyed by alien plants. Even when they spray glyphosate, they use minuscule amounts and frequently they merely inject it into individual plants or paint it onto cut stems.\n\n\u201cSure, it\u2019s always better to use no-toxic alternatives, if they\u2019re practicable,\u201d says Dan Ashe, who directed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service under Barack Obama. \u201cOften, however, they\u2019re simply not. For instance, it would have been possible to hand-pull the head-high invasive verbesina from the ground at Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, but it would have taken time and personnel that were simply not available. Use of herbicides like Roundup can accelerate the work, creating urgently needed nesting space for thousands of albatrosses.\u201d\n\nOne boots-on-the ground NGO that gets it about glyphosate is the Nature Conservancy (for whom, full disclosure, I contribute a column to its online magazine). It applies glyphosate more than any of the other 18 herbicides it uses to save and recover fish and wildlife.\n\nIn Augus,t I toured TNC\u2019s floodplain-forest restoration project at the Silvio Conte National Wildlife Refuge along the Connecticut River in Massachusetts. Guiding me was TNC\u2019s floodplain ecologist, Christian Marks.\n\nFloodplain forests are endangered habitats. American elm, the oldest and most abundant floodplain species, has been devastated by Dutch elm disease. But TNC and its partners have developed disease-resistant elms. Marks and his team are planting these and other vanishing floodplain species in the refuge\u2019s abandoned hayfields.\n\nBut first they must eradicate alien vegetation that would otherwise shade out seedlings. Their only option is glyphosate.\n\nThe results I saw were stunning and uplifting: fields bright with native forbs and wildflowers; bees, hummingbirds and butterflies nectaring on blooms; goldfinches gorging on thistle seed; kingbirds hawking insects. Inside deer-proof electric fences planted saplings thrived.\n\nFloodplain trees produce seeds in spring, refueling countless species of birds exhausted from migration. That\u2019s why migratory birds follow river corridors north.\n\nElms, highest in the floodplain, drop seeds first because that\u2019s where the spring freshet first recedes, then silver maples, then cottonwoods, then willows, each feeding different bird species as they arrive.\n\nRecently, representatives of an environmental group (Marks can\u2019t remember which) knocked on his door, asking that he sign a petition to ban glyphosate on all public lands. \u201cA ban would have blocked this restoration,\u201d he told us.\n\nAmerica\u2019s three coasts and inland lakes and rivers are blighted by phragmites, an alien grass. It\u2019s crowding out native plants and evicting mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates\u2014which, given that surviving habitats are fully occupied, is often a death sentence.\n\nIn Utah, for example, phragmites has wiped out gamefish and waterfowl and pushed a federally endangered fish\u2014the June sucker\u2014closer to extinction.\n\nPhragmites roots run so deep that it in most cases the only management option is herbicide, usually glyphosate.\n\nAaron Eagar, the state\u2019s noxious-weed program manager, explains: \u201cUtah Lake has 7,000 acres of phragmites around its shoreline. In the 1950s it wasn\u2019t there. For the last seven years we\u2019ve treated it with Rodeo [a glyphosate formulation labeled for water], and we\u2019ve brought back lots of natives and opened up areas for fish and fishing.\u201d\n\nIn the Everglades, Old World climbing fern smothers critical wildlife habitat called \u201ctree islands,\u201d evicting (therefore killing) raptors, ducks, wading birds, marsh rabbits, deer, raccoons, opossums, otters, reptiles and amphibians.\n\nWherever the South Florida Water Management District treats infested tree islands with glyphosate, it reports \u201camazing results, speedy resurgence of native ferns and forb-type understory plants.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe thought all the native canopy growth was dead,\u201d says district invasive species biologist LeRoy Rodgers. \u201cThough stressed and defoliated, species like dahoon holly, swamp bay, wax myrtle, coco plum and red maple are coming back.\u201d\n\nCalifornia verdicts notwithstanding, there\u2019s zero evidence that glyphosate causes cancer or otherwise endangers the public. But bans on all glyphosate use are proliferating locally, and a national ban seems possible if not probable. The safety of herbicides needs to be determined by scientists, not chemophobic California jurors or vulturine attorneys.
