Most kids don\u2019t carry flashlights while out on Halloween night, the group claims, while \u201c65 percent [of parents] don\u2019t discuss Halloween safety with their children.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, 12 percent of children age 5 and younger reportedly go trick-or-treating without adult supervision, according to their data. Fifty-one percent of millennials polled, too, said that Halloween was their favorite holiday, said the HCA, asking why people would want to \u201ccram it into two rushed evening weekday hours when it deserves a full day?!\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nIn its latest statement, the HCA acknowledged that though they have not yet been able to formally change the date of Halloween, they\u2019ve launched a new initiative called \u201cNational Trick or Treat Day in partnership with the National Day Calendar, Party City and \u201cother brands.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve listened to ALL of your feedback since the petition started in 2018 and view this as an opportunity to truly honor what Halloween is \u2013 a celebration of self-expression and unity. While we still believe an end-of-October Saturday observance will promote safety and increase the fun, this year we will be launching a national initiative designed to enhance the Halloween that we all know and love,\u201d an update to the petition reads.\n\n\u201cNational Trick or Treat Day will take place annually on the last Saturday of October so families across the country can participate in community parades, throw neighborhood parties and opt for daytime Trick or Treating,\u201d the HCA went on. \u201cWe will launch the #ALLoween campaign designed to support the all-day celebration of National Trick or Treat Day AND the time-honored traditions of Halloween on October 31st.\n\n\u201cWith your support, we will create a safer, longer, bigger celebration for ALL by making National Trick or Treat Day official!\u201d\n\nThe HCA reportedly updated its petition to include news of the inaugural National Trick or Treat Day on Oct. 23, only a few days before the date of the event, according to Romper.\n\nLIST OF MOST-SEARCHED COSTUME IDEAS REVEALS DEFINITE TREND FOR 2019\n\nMany who signed the petition felt that National Trick or Treat Day would make the spookiest day of the year \u201cmuch safer\u201d and more fun for people of all ages, but critics on social media appear more skeptical of the pitch.\n\n\u201c#NationalTrickOrTreatDay (aka \"ALLoween\") has obnoxiously been made official & it can kiss my a--,\" one Twitter user said. \"You want free candy, show up on 10/31 Halloween. If you come knocking on the last Saturday of October I won't answer, but if I do you'll get a grape tomato.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe already have #NationalTrickOrTreatDay, it's called Halloween and it's on Oct. 31st,\u201d another agreed. \u201cHey Snickers, how about you help us make 10/31 a federal holiday instead of supporting this date change nonsense. None of us that truly love Halloween want this,\u201d they added, referencing how the candy bar brand previously voiced support for shiftiing the holiday\u2019s date.\n\n\u201c@PartyCity It\u2019s a lie to say it\u2019s a #SaferHalloween. Saturday is the most dangerous day of the week for roadways & higher risk of #DrunkDrivers w/ adult out celebrating too,\u201d another claimed, calling out the party supplies store. \u201c#Alloween & #NationalTrickOrTreatDay should just be called: BIGGER PROFIT DAY.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for the HCA and Party City were not immediately available to offer further comment on National Trick-or-Treat Day.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAccording to The History Channel, All Hallows Eve has been celebrated on Oct. 31 for thousands of years, originating with the Celtic celebration of Samhain, to honor the boundary between the living and the dead.", "description": "You might want to pick up that Halloween candy sooner rather than later.", "authors": ["Janine Puhak", "Janine Puhak Is An Editor For Fox News Lifestyle.
