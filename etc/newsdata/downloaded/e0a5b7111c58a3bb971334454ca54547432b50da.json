Fury jumped the barricade, shouting and pointing at Strowman, but was held back by at least eight security staff as Strowman carried on laughing in the ring.\n\nThe scenes hinted at a potential move into WWE for Fury,who is is currently awaiting a rematch with WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder.\n\nWilder has agreed to face Fury again as long as he comes through his next fight against Luis Ortiz unscathed on November 23.\n\nThe \u2018Gypsy King\u2019 was last in the ring on September 14 when he scored a unanimous points victory against Sweden\u2019s Otto Wallin.\n\nEarlier at Smackdown, The Rock made a big impact on his return as he floored Baron Corbin.\n\nAfter humiliating Corbin the 47-year-old then goaded the former general manager of RAW into a fight.\n\nWith the help of Becky Lynch, he ended it quickly after landing a \u2018People\u2019s Elbow\u2019, followed by a \u2018Rock Bottom\u2019 move.", "description": "Fury had to be restrained by security after Strowman sent Dolph Ziggler careering into heavyweight boxing champ", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20464715.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-05-at-034256.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
