That includes drawings, cartoons and memes about suicide, in addition to any other method \u201cpromoting\u201d self-harm. It is a welcome move from a key player in the debate over online harms, but it represents a small drop in what is fast becoming an even murkier ocean.\n\nThe regulation of harmful, yet non-illegal content, remains a concept devoid of clarity. Even the government seems to be perplexed by the issue \u2013 the plans set out in the online harms white paper which was published earlier this year was widely criticised as lacking in definition. The question, it seems, is proving more complicated than the answer. In the meantime, and in the absence of any form of regulation, tech giants have taken action in response to public pressure, which has been growing since the tragic death of British teenager Molly Russell. In identifying the scale of the issue, her death has rightly changed the sense of immediacy.\n\nIn February this year, Instagram pledged to remove graphic self-harm related content and not to show non-graphic self-harm related content in its search, hashtags and the explore tab. Instagram says that between April and June it removed 834,000 pieces of content from its site. Yet the lack of transparency over the specific nature of this content, who (or what) made the decision to remove it, and on what basis, should give us all cause for concern as Instagram moves into this new phase.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nMemes, for example, which will now be the subject of Instagram\u2019s scrutiny, are a relatively new phenomenon. They are widely considered to be an expression of a cultural idea or practice. They can be interpreted as being humorous, critical, divisive \u2013 even dangerous. The multifaceted meanings attached to one small box on the internet will require careful consideration by Instagram if it wishes to be consistent in its decision making.\n\nBy extending its pledge to remove harmful content to involve more creative forms of self-expression, Instagram is moving into grey territory. It will need to take care to avoid any unnecessary infringement of a person\u2019s right to speak about their personal experiences. How might Instagram resolve a case where the meme\u2019s image shows non-graphic, self-harm related content, but the meaning of the text which accompanies it encourages survival? When non-graphic images of self-harm such as healed scars were blurred by Instagram, the hashtag #youcantcensormyskin ignited debate about why such content is considered harmful.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 14 women using social media to change the world Show all 14 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. 14 women using social media to change the world 1/14 Marley Dias @iammarleydias At just 11 years old, Marley Dias gained international attention in 2016 after becoming frustrated with the lack of diversity in her school curriculum. What followed was a viral social media campaign, #1000blackgirlbooks, calling for titles featuring black girls as protagonists to be donated. Nearly 4,000 books were donated, and Dias now tackles prejudice and advocates for diversity in literature. Getty 2/14 Rina Sawayama @rinasonline Rina Sawayama came in a blaze of neon and sci-fi coolness in early 2016 when she released the single 'Where U Are', which explored how humans interact with digital media. Since then, the singer and model from north London has been a trailblazer for intersectional feminism. Whether it\u2019s singing about her experiences as a pansexual woman or starting Twitter conversations about cultural appropriation in the media, Sawayama has taken both the music world and social media by storm with her politically vibrant work. A quick look at her Instagram account (@rinasonline) will reveal a confident woman who is not afraid to voice her opinions to her 141,000 followers. Getty 3/14 Chidera Eggerue @theslumflower At only 24 years old, Eggerue came to prominence with her viral 2017 social media campaign #SaggyBoobsMatter. 'It was only small-boobed women who were \u2018allowed\u2019 to not wear a bra,' the author said in an interview with The Guardian. \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand why \u2026 I had to challenge it.\u201d Her decision to not wear a bra shouldn\u2019t be deemed radical, yet here she is in 2019 challenging the ideas that women are pressured to confirming too. Women of all ages and shapes use the hashtag to show pride in themselves, as a result of the body positivity Eggerue championed. Her blog, The Slumflower, also discusses sexism, feminism and racism. Getty Images 4/14 Scarlett Curtis @scarcurtis You may know her as the writer who exposed Philip Green\u2019s willingness to profit off feminism but reject the idea of having a pink pop-up stall in Topshop back in October 2018. However, Scarlett Curtis is a trail-blazing feminist in other ways too. The author of Feminists Don\u2019t Wear Pink & Other Lies co-founded The Pink Protest \u2013 a collective helping young feminist activist to take action online \u2013 in 2017, all while using her social media to challenge misogyny whenever she encounters it. Getty 5/14 Tarana Burke @TaranaBurke Also known as the mother of the #MeToo movement, Tarana Burke is an American social activist who is largely responsible for the international movement against sexual harassment that went viral in October 2017. The phrase was first used in 2006 on Burke\u2019s Myspace account after she responded to a 13-year-old girl who had been sexually assaulted. The hashtag gained traction after actress Alyssa Milano encouraged victims of harassment to tweet the phrase. The call-out followed sexual abuse allegations against disgraced film producter Harvey Weinstein and has been used at least 19 million times on social media. Burke is a life-long activist for victims of sexual assault and harassment and continues to campaign such issues on social media. She has single-handedly changed the conversation on sexual violence. Getty 6/14 Sophie Sandberg @catcallsofnyc Tired of being unable to walk down the street without being constantly catcalled by men, activist Sophie Sandberg took to Instagram to expose an epidemic rife in society. Armed with multi-coloured chalk, she began documenting the horrific words that had been said to her all over New York in late 2016. Talking to the BBC about the project she stated: 'By writing [catcalls] in the same place that it happened, I hope the words may remember and think \"Oh those were my words\".' Women around the globe have been inspired by Sandberg\u2019s work and Instagram accounts of women chalking messages have since sprung up from Columbia to Bangladesh. Sophie Sandberg 7/14 Hannah Witton @hannahwitton Hannah Witton is a sex-positive YouTuber and author who has vlogged candidly about sexual health, relationships and women\u2019s issues since 2011. Over the years, the Mancunian has amassed over 500,000 subscribers.

The vlogger is also a champion for body positivity (her most viewed video with over 8 million views is about the struggles of large boobs) and invisible illnesses \u2013 as she herself suffers from ulcerative colitis and proudly wears a stoma.

This is why the star established the mental health community Gurls Talk. It began in 2015 with an Instagram account and now serves as a place to discuss topics affecting women without any fear of judgement. It has since grown into a weekly podcast and a series of organised events that have brought women together from across the globe. Talking to the BBC about the project, Aboah noted: 'At school there still isn\u2019t a place for girls and boys to realise they\u2019re not alone \u2026There is a light at the end of the tunnel. I promise that.' Getty 9/14 Laci Green @gogreen18 YouTuber Laci Green has been educating her subscribers on the nuances of sex education for over 10 years and has amassed over 1.4 million subscribers. The vlogger's videos, which are prominent in the sex-positive movement due to their candour, cover topics such as birth control, hormones and abortion in an attempt to remove the stigma surrounding them. Green is also very outspoken against slut-shaming and sexual harassment, being one of the first YouTubers to address the sexual harassment claims levied against vlogger Sam Pepper in 2014. Getty 10/14 Ash Sarkar @AyoCaesar From describing broadcaster Piers Morgan an 'idiot' to declaring herself a communist on Good Morning Britain, Ash Sarkar is a dynamic journalist making waves on the internet and TV. The north London native champions the rights of women and immigrants on social media, with a Twitter account that is rife with political commentary with a humorous edge. Meanwhile, her Instagram showcases all her campaigning work including protests on climate change and Brexit. Sarkar is also a senior editor at Novara Media \u2013 an independent, radical left-wing news organisation. Ash Sarkar 11/14 Gina Martin @ginamartin Writer and activist Gina Martin hit national headlines when she began a viral campaign to make 'upskirting' illegal. Taking to Facebook, Martin explained how a man took photos of her crotch without her permission and got away with it in a post that subsequently went viral in 2017. She then launched a petition for her case to be reopened and for the action to be made part of the 2003 Sexual Offences Act. Using the hashtag, #StopSkirtingTheIssue, the petition managed to get over 100,000 signatures. As of 2019, 'upskirting' is now illegal and this is largely down to the efforts of Martin. The activist continues to promote feminist causes to her 40,000 Instagram followers.

Getty\n\nA balance must be struck between the rights of those individuals effected by self-harm or thoughts of suicide who wish to share their experiences, and the potential harm which sharing those stories might cause to others. Since February, algorithms have helped to remove a large quantity of graphic self-harm content from the site. There has, so far, been no public explanation by Instagram regarding the reasons why its algorithms deemed certain content to require censorship. This sets a dangerous precedent. It remains to be seen how an algorithm will deal with the nuances involved in more creative forms of self-expression, such as memes and drawings. Transparency and accountability around such decision-making will be vital to establish and maintain public trust in the platform.\n\nInstagram was right to acknowledge the complexity of the issue and that it will need time to fully implement its new strategy. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be the last step we take,\u201d Instagram\u2019s chief Adam Mosseri confirmed.\n\nInstagram\u2019s next step is already overdue. It will need to be a crucial one. While the removal of graphic self-harm related content is certainly welcome, it does not address a central problem which has, as yet, been left largely unaddressed: the influence of Instagram\u2019s algorithms.\n\nInstagram\u2019s popularity comes from its ability to give a user\u2019s most \u201crelevant posts\u201d the most visibility. What shows up first in your feed is determined by what posts and accounts you engage with the most, as well as other contributing factors such as the timeliness of posts, how often you use Instagram, and how many people you follow. This is undoubtedly a valuable tool, which allows a user to cultivate their own personal space on the internet. However, according to her father, it was Instagram\u2019s algorithm which allowed \u201csimilar content\u201d to be \u201cpushed\u201d on Molly as she viewed images of self-harm.\n\nAs users of the platform, it seems we have little control over the alien concept of the algorithm. There is certainly a lack of available information on whether it is even possible for a user to substantially alter the algorithm once it becomes established on a page, should they wish to do so. It will remain to be seen how Instagram will address this thorny issue. It will need to admit that its algorithm, its core appeal, might be just as harmful as the content which it is pledging to remove.\n\nIf you are experiencing feelings of distress and isolation, or are struggling to cope, The Samaritans offers support; you can speak to someone for free over the phone, in confidence, on 116 123 (UK and Ireland), email jo@samaritans.org, or visit the Samaritans website to find details of your nearest branch.\n\nFor services local to you, the national mental health database \u2013 hubofhope.co.uk \u2013 allows you to enter your postcode to search for organisations and charities who offer mental health advice and support in your area.\n\nMadeline Palacz is The Independent\u2019s editorial compliance manager", "description": "On Sunday, Instagram announced that it would be extending its pledge to remove all graphic images of self-harm from its platform\u00a0to incorporate\u00a0\u201cfictional depictions of self-harm\u201d.
