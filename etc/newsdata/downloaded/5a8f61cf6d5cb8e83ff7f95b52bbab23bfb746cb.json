By contrast, the number of convictions for rape plunged over the same period \u2013 from 2,635 in 2017-18 to 1,925 in 2018-19.\n\nKate Ellis, a solicitor at the Centre for Women\u2019s Justice in London, is convinced #MeToo has had a direct effect. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraged people to feel able to come forward, but whether procedures are ready in this country [to handle complaints] is another question,\u201d she told the Guardian.\n\n\u201cThe rise in reporting to the police is very significant and that\u2019s probably an indication of victims feeling they will be believed and supported. I have clients say to me they were victims of sexual offences but didn\u2019t report it. Then around the time of #MeToo they decided they had to go to the police.\n\n\u201cHowever, it has been accompanied by a pushback \u2013 people saying: \u2018How do we know these are true?\u2019 or that we shouldn\u2019t blindly believe everyone who makes a report.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s libel laws, she added, made it more difficult for allegations and suspicions to be aired without the risk of being sued. \u201c#MeToo became about raising awareness of the prevalence of sexual violence and harassment,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s much more difficult to do in the UK.\u201d\n\nOne #MeToo-inspired case being fought through the London courts involves five women who posted allegations online that the singer/rapper Jonny Fox was a \u201csexual predator\u201d and emotionally abusive. They are facing a multiple libel claim of up to \u00a360,000 from Fox, who denies all the claims.\n\nSuzanne McKie QC, whose firm Farore Law specialises in discrimination, equalities and employment cases, said the impact had sometimes been counterproductive. \u201cA number of male managers in corporate organisations have said to me they are not recruiting attractive women any more,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s their way of dealing with it. There was always going to be a backlash \u2013 as there was to feminism.\u201d\n\nMcKie said she also heard comments about \u201cwomen complaining too readily\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s gone a bit too far, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d She sometimes represents men in employment cases involving allegations of sexual harassment.\n\nA greater willingness to believe that male managers are capable of misconduct at work may not always translate into better justice, she said. \u201cSome companies may be compensating for what they failed to do in the past.\u201d\n\nShe has handled two recent cases, she said, where male executives were sacked \u201con grounds that might not previously have led to them being dismissed\u201d.\n\nMen, she said, tended to settle in sexual harassment employment disputes because they did not want to be identified. \u201cThe difficulty in these cases is the reputational consequences.\u201d\n\nWomen often cannot afford to take complaints to employment tribunals. McKie, who is qualified as both a barrister and solicitor, regularly appears on a no-win, no-fee basis. #MeToo has brought her more business, she believes. \u201cIt\u2019s gone up 300% or 400% in the last two years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot out there,\u201d she said. \u201cFirms tend not to investigate. They say it\u2019s a police matter. But employers should still be doing investigations.\u201d\n\nA government consultation on sexual harassment in the workplace, which closed on 2 October, is considering whether existing laws provide sufficient protection. Within the legal profession itself, there has been growing concern about the problem. Sexual harassment of younger barristers is not being reported because pupils and junior lawyers fear their careers will be damaged if they complain, Prof Jo Delahunty QC suggested in a public lecture at Gresham College in central London last year.\n\nA lawyers\u2019 organisation called Behind the Gown, inspired by the #MeToo movement, held an inaugural meeting in May 2018 and raised complaints of inappropriate behaviour and discriminatory conduct by judges, QCs and senior lawyers.\n\nIn May, the London-based International Bar Association published a survey of almost 7,000 lawyers across 135 countries that reported that bullying and sexual harassment were rife in the legal profession.", "description": "UK lawyers say more women are coming forward, but are police and prosecutors ready?", "authors": ["Owen Bowcott", "Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/269d9258794c4499198270c874377135f3895a9d/0_204_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6e47975b8a86364806a0cb962685b6e5", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
