Remember when Biden was surrounded by reporters in Iowa and FNC\u2019s Peter Doocy asked about the Ukrainian corruption story? Biden shoved his finger in Doocy\u2019s face and demanded that he \u201cask the right question\u201d? Well, it\u2019s happened again.\n\nThis time it was during a press conference in Los Angeles. Biden appeared at the Service Employees International Union forum Friday and took questions from reporters. Naturally, the topic of the Biden family\u2019s alleged corruption in Ukraine came up. Joe Biden showed a flash of anger when he was asked, \u201cHow was your role as vice president in charge of policy in Ukraine and your son\u2019s job in Ukraine, how is that not a conflict of interest?\u201d He deflected and boldly, unashamedly answered, \u201cIt\u2019s not a conflict of interest. There\u2019s been no indication of any conflict of interest from Ukraine or anywhere else. Period. I\u2019m not going to respond to that!\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not going to respond to that. The arrogance is astounding.\n\nJoe Biden loses his cool when confronted by a reporter asking whether there was \u2018conflict of interest\u2019 regarding his son's Ukraine/China business scandal. pic.twitter.com/kW2U0IwztJ \u2014 Giovanni Cavalcanti (@giovannicavett) October 4, 2019\n\nFinger jabbing, angry voiced Biden tells the reporter to, well, ask the right question. There\u2019s nothing here, just move along from this story about Ukrainian corruption and his son\u2019s sweet deal. Biden is the King of Swamp Creatures, after 40 plus years in Washington, D.C. and he thinks it is perfectly legit to tell a reporter which question to ask. There is the additional whiff of desperation that creeps into Biden\u2019s response, too. He\u2019s on his way out of the race whether he is ready to admit it or not.\n\nFor Biden to say that there is no conflict of interest is laughable. If Hunter Biden\u2019s last name was any other name, he would not have been given a seat on the board of Burisma. It is completely reasonable to ask about how his son happened to get such an opportunity in Ukraine, especially since Biden, in his role as Vice-President was the point man from the Obama administration in dealings with the country. This isn\u2019t rocket science. The elder Biden just thought he wouldn\u2019t be held accountable for his son\u2019s actions. It\u2019s business as usual in the swamp.\n\nBiden wants to deflect to President Trump. He usually gets away with that, too, because the press treats him delicately, to put it mildly. Biden is suppose to be the safe choice to beat Trump in 2020 and his name is already well-known. So, he points at Trump and says, hey, he\u2019s the bad guy. Orange Man bad.\n\n\u201cThis is the guy that\u2019s unhinged,\u201d Biden said about the president. \u201cHe is unhinged. I worry about what he\u2019s going to do \u2014 not about me or my family. I\u2019m worried about what he\u2019ll do in the next year in the presidency, as this thing continues to rot on his watch.\u201d \u201cThe American people know me, and they know him,\u201d he added.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign is floundering. He is a really bad candidate, much like a 2.0 version of Hillary\u2019s 2016 campaign. He\u2019s protected by his staff and only participates in the safest of campaign events. His campaign schedule is extremely light, especially in comparison to Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, also both in their 70s. Warren also has a day job as a U.S. Senator. The problem for Biden now is that his own party may be his undoing. Democrats are behind the push to investigate all things Ukraine and the Biden family is caught up in that. The Ukraine investigations will take out Biden but not Trump, as everything stands now.\n\nElizabeth Warren is ahead of Biden in some polling now. As I write this, she is ahead in Iowa by 2.7% in the RCP averaging. With Bernie\u2019s health scare and the eventual admitting that it was, in fact, a heart attack that he suffered, the battle between him and Warren for the far left vote may result in Warren advancing more quickly. If Bernie\u2019s voters get spooked about his health, they will go to Warren.\n\nBiden is not only looking frail physically and mentally but he does a weird kind of macho-signaling that makes him look weak. He says things like he\u2019ll beat Trump like a drum or he\u2019d take Trump behind the gym and \u201cbeat the hell out of him\u201d.\n\nAdding problematic actions by his son to an already uninspiring campaign is causing Biden to lash out. It\u2019s not a good look. He looks just as entitled as Hillary did in 2016. Instead of continuing to sound like an authoritarian old man past his prime, he should be looking for an off-ramp. He can leave the primary race quite authentically by saying he needs more time with the family. In this case it is a legit reason.\n\nBiden\u2019s fundraising isn\u2019t the best, either. He fundraises behind closed doors and is dependent on big money contributors. His campaign is not a grassroots movement. He raised $15.2 million in the third quarter of the year. That falls short compared to the money raised by Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg.\n\nThe third quarter of the year, which spans from July to the end of September, is typically the slowest of the year, but Biden was outflanked by at least two opponents. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., tapped his small-dollar fundraising army for an impressive $25.3 million haul in the quarter, while Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, who has become a darling of the left-leaning donor class, posted a $19.1 million haul.\n\nElizabeth Warren continues to be strong in fundraising. She raised $24.6 million, just behind Bernie. Look for Buttigieg to rise as Biden falls. I think he will be the safe alternative to the more radical leftists. He will fill the Biden slot left open when he leaves the race.", "description": "\"I'm not going to respond to that!\"", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/biden-vegas.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
