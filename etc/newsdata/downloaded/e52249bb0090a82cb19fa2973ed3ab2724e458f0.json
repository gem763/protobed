The treatment of women as walking orifices. The hairless, Barbie-like bodies. The focus on male pleasure. The am-dram storylines that nearly always involve a babysitter. There will always be exceptions of course \u00ad\u00ad\u2013 online porn caters to all tastes and niches \u00ad\u2013 but it\u2019s fair to say that its aspirations are limited. Unless, of course, it\u2019s art.\n\nThe intersection between art and pornography has sustained film and visual arts for decades. Put explicit sexual imagery in a gallery and it becomes a thing of aesthetic and intellectual import \u2013 think Fiona Banner\u2019s Turner Prize-nominated \u201cArsewoman in Wonderland\u201d from 2002, comprising a transcript of a sex movie unfurling in big pink letters across a screen; Cosey Fanni Tutti\u2019s Prostitution exhibition at the ICA which prompted walkouts, scandalised headlines and a debate in parliament; and pretty much anything by Jeff Koons. Similarly, when a noted film director such as Pasolini, Bertolucci, Bigas Luna or Gaspar No\u00e9 drops some hardcore humping into their arthouse masterwork, it becomes a thought-provoking reflection on physical relationships \u00ad\u2013 or that, at least, is the thinking.\n\nBut what happens when instead of bringing pornography into the arts space you invite art into the porn zone? This week, the former Disney star Bella Thorne won a Pornhub award for her directorial debut, Her & Him, a 30-minute film featuring porn actors Abella Danger (Her) and Small Hands (Him), which is currently available to premium Pornhub subscribers. While Thorne described the film as \u201cbeautiful visionary art\u201d, the Pornhub vice president Corey Price hailed it as \u201ca modernistic, sexually explicit Romeo and Juliet-like depiction of two star-crossed lovers who have unbridled sexual longing for one another\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBecause I like to go the extra mile for this column, I have watched Her & Him. Let\u2019s just say that the word \u201cvisionary\u201d seems a stretch. I\u2019m also not clear where Shakespeare\u2019s great romantic tragedy fits into two twenty-somethings waving knives around and banging each other senseless in an apartment strewn with pop art knick-knacks, but the eye sees what the eye sees. Then again, in presenting a relationship in which the lines between love and loathing, tenderness and brutality are blurred, Her & Him is perhaps unusual in the annals of pornography in its attempts to show the power struggles than can occur within a physical relationship. And perhaps we should be thankful that, in this case, the woman isn\u2019t merely a body to be screwed. Thorne\u2019s vision attempts to show what happens when a woman\u2019s desire takes precedence over a man\u2019s.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The 10 best sex scenes in film 1/10 Blue Valentine Derek Cianfrance dared to portray sex with any sense of realism, both physically and emotionally, only to quickly get slapped with an NC-17 rating for showing Michelle Williams\u2019 character, Cindy, on the receiving end of oral sex. \u201cThe sex felt real - it wasn't sexy or 'a sex scene', and that's why we got into trouble,\u201d co-star Ryan Gosling remarked to The Observer at the time. \u201cYou shouldn't be penalised for doing a good job.\u201d After successfully appealing against the MPAA\u2019s decision, Blue Valentine reached cinemas as an R, thankfully allowing mainstream audiences to see how emotionally complex a matter sex can actually be, especially in a broken down marriage like the one shared by its lead characters. 2/10 Love & Basketball Gina Prince-Bythewood has masterfully shown Hollywood how cinema can portray realistic sex without any loss of romanticism or intimacy. That\u2019s especially true of her directorial debut, 2000\u2019s Love & Basketball, in which Monica (Sanaa Lathan) loses her virginity to childhood sweetheart, Quincy (Omar Epps). The moment is wonderfully tender, aided by Maxwell\u2019s cover of Kate Bush\u2019s \u201cThis Woman\u2019s Work\u201d, while being one of the rare films that actually shows the use of a condom. \u201cThe only note that I ever got from the studio during the filmmaking process was that when I shot that scene, they looked at the dailies and they said, they didn\u2019t think she was enjoying it enough,\u201d Prince-Bythewood told The Huffington Post. \u201cAnd my argument was, it\u2019s the first time and despite what the male fantasy might be, it\u2019s not that great.\u201d New Line Cinema 3/10 Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s raucous classic inverts the American sex comedy: Julio (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal) and Tenoch (Diego Luna) are stereotypical, sex-obsessed young men distraught at the concept of their girlfriends leaving the country. Choosing to live as bachelors, they befriend an older woman (Maribel Verd\u00fa), who seduces both of them. Yet, the film drives them towards one, real truth: their own bisexuality, finally freed during the film\u2019s famous threesome. Though Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n's conclusion is tragic - Julio and Tenoch's reject their own truth, turn their backs on each other, and suppress their feelings - their threesome still marks a moment of genuine, harmonious sensuality. 20th Century Fox 4/10 God's Own Country God\u2019s Own Country star Alec Secareanu admitted he was initially \u201cvery afraid\u201d of the kinds of scenes he would be tasked with filming for the gay drama film. \u201cBut the way each character has sex tells a lot about them; the way that they develop their relationship,\u201d he told Attitude. The first sexual encounter between Secareanu\u2019s character Gheorghe and Johnny (Josh O\u2019Connor) is quick, aggressive and with little intimacy. As Johnny slowly learns to open up to Gheroghe, their second encounter is far more romantic; intense in a different way to the first. Both actors later told of how they developed a close bond in real life after working together on-screen. Orion Pictures 5/10 Carol A film that finds its eroticism in small gestures - in the languid rest of a glove, in a glance, shared across a crowded room - when it comes to director Todd Haynes actually filming the first time Therese (Rooney Mara) and Carol (Cate Blanchett) have sex, their chemistry is already so palpable that the moment feels nothing short of explosive. \u201cIt's very much like shooting a musical number,\u201d Haynes told E!News of the scene. \u201cYou start the music and basically you just go and the camera finds the moments and the beats. And we had some amazing material with these two women to work with.\u201d StudioCanal 6/10 Moonlight Barry Jenkins\u2019 Oscar-winner is one of the most tender depictions of yearning in modern cinema. Its protagonist Chiron (played by Ashton Sanders here, at other points by Alex R. Hibbert and Trevante Rhodes) experiences his first sexual encounter with fellow student Kevin (Jharrel Jerome) on a quiet, isolated beach. Their fumbling may pay testament to the awkwardness of a teenager\u2019s first experiences, but Jenkins\u2019 approach also gives the moment a profound grace, and an acknowledgement of how it will come to shape Chiron\u2019s own view of himself. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time I filmed a sex scene. It\u2019s the first time these actors had performed a sex scene,\u201d Jenkins told Entertainment Weekly of the scene. \u201cIt\u2019s not gratuitous. It\u2019s very delicate in keeping with most of the film, but it kept me up at night. I really wanted to get the feelings of that first sort of sexual expression, and I wanted to get it right\u2026 but then, when we got to shoot it, it rolled off like butter.\u201d A24 7/10 Don't Look Now Much like Blue Valentine, Nicolas Roeg\u2019s 1973 classic swiftly faced controversy due to a sex scene so emotionally faithful (while also depicting a female character, Julie Christie\u2019s Laura, receiving oral sex), that it caused clashes with censors. A grieving couple desperately holding onto the shreds of their marriage after the death of their child, Laura and John (Donald Sutherland)\u2019s raw emotions and vulnerability in this moment are famously intercut with post-coital preparations to go to dinner - an attempt, in fact, to satiate censors.

There\u2019s no getting through this list without acknowledging that fact, and there\u2019s no better film to summarise it than Team America: World Police and its infamous puppet intercourse, enthusiastically filing through every sexual position in the book. As puppet creator Stephen Chiodo noted to MovieWeb, it\u2019s the scene\u2019s bracing artifice that\u2019s actually the key to its humour. As he explained, \u201cThe more realistic it became, the less funny it was. The more axes of movement, the more lifelike movement we gave the puppets during the sex scene, it just wasn\u2019t funny.

Rita (Laura Harring) and Betty (Naomi Watts) may consummate their bubbling affections for each other in a sensuous, dreamlike manner - but who is Rita in this moment? Who is Betty? Is this encounter real or imagined? This moment of lush, Hollywood perfection only creates the set up for Mulholland Drive\u2019s earth-shattering twist. Betty is now Diane, and her own sexual experience couldn\u2019t be any more different: a tear-soaked, anguished masturbation scene that seems exemplary of her own broken soul. 10/10 Unfaithful One of the finest examples of the erotic thriller, director Adrian Lyne depicts the extramarital affair in its full urgency, its entire spectrum of conflicted emotions, as suburban housewife Connie (Diane Lane) becomes enraptured by a handsome young Frenchman (Olivier Martinez). Their initial encounter is at first tenuous, tender, before a hunger seems to consume Connie and her guilt is momentarily forgotten in the throes of extreme passion, only for them to creep slowly back on the train ride home.

By definition, art involves the application of human imagination and skill, and is celebrated for its emotional power. But in real life, it\u2019s more complicated than that \u2013 just ask Marcel Duchamp or Carl \u201cpile of bricks\u201d Andre. According to Oscar Wilde, art is \u201can intense form of individualism\u201d, though I prefer Brian Eno\u2019s definition, that \u201cart is everything you don\u2019t have to do\u201d \u2013 the things that we create not merely to survive but to enhance our lives. Eno even listed some examples \u2013 \u201csymphonies, perfume, sports cars, graffiti, needlepoints, monuments, tattoos, slang, Ming vases, doodles, poodles, apple strudels\u201d \u2013 though, unhelpfully, he didn\u2019t mention porn.\n\nClearly, we don\u2019t need pornography to survive. But there are ideological and moral questions around money, manipulation and titillation that underpin whether it can be judged as anything more meaningful than a masturbatory aid. Real-life images of non-consensual sex and child pornography isn\u2019t art \u2013 it\u2019s evidence of a crime. Meanwhile, porn that degrades its participants can scarcely be considered anything other than cruel and exploitative.\n\nAn orgy filmed and put online with the sole purpose of getting viewers off hardly counts as artistic endeavour. However, put a video of an orgy in a gallery or an independent cinema, perhaps with some sex and gender theory thrown in, and you might argue that it becomes something else entirely. The historical shag-fests depicted by classical painters such as Poussin and Claude Lorrain continue to be viewed as high art. Context and intention is everything.\n\nIn discussing his 1989 exhibition Made in Heaven, the artist Jeff Koons said his intention was both to provoke discussion about acceptable expressions of sexuality and get viewers hot and horny. He saw no reason why you can\u2019t do both things at once. Clearly, the line between art and porn is a fuzzy one.\n\nIn aesthetic terms, of course, porn is mostly terrible, so perhaps we should applaud Thorne\u2019s efforts to elevate it into something with artistic worth. Whether she has succeeded remains a matter of debate, though. Art, much like sexual desire, is in the eye of the beholder.", "description": "There are all sorts of reasons why porn is dreadful.
