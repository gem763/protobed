Wilson Ramos extended his hitting streak to 26 games and Pete Alonso crushed his 44th homer to put the Mets in position for a win over the current leaders in the NL wild-card hunt.\n\nMets manager Mickey Callaway lifted reliever Seth Lugo after he pitched a perfect eighth inning. Lugo routinely gets six outs per outing, but Callaway thought the lead was safe enough to go deeper into the bullpen.\n\nSewald allowed four hits to his five batters, including Trea Turner\u2019s RBI double and Anthony Rendon\u2019s RBI single. Avilan allowed a single to load the bases, and then D\u00edaz (1-7) relieved and allowed a two-run double to pinch-hitter Ryan Zimmerman followed by Suzuki\u2019s blast.\n\nSuzuki pointed into the home dugout before rounding first base, pumped his fist at second and was swarmed by teammates at home plate. It was his 16th homer of the season.\n\nThe Nationals/Expos franchise had never won a game after trailing by at least six runs in the ninth or later.\n\nJavy Guerra (3-1) retired the only batter he faced to end the Mets\u2018 ninth.\n\nWashington is the first team to allow five or more runs in the top of the ninth and get even more in the bottom of the inning for a walk-off win since the Red Sox on June 18, 1962 against the Washington Senators, according to STATS.\n\nNew York\u2019s five-run ninth was aided when Nats shortstop Trea Turner forgot how many outs there were and passed on a possible double-play grounder, instead throwing to first.\n\nThe game began as a duel between the most recent NL Cy Young Award winners. Washington\u2019s Max Scherzer allowed four runs and five hits while striking out seven in six innings, the longest of his three starts since coming off the injured list last month.\n\nNew York\u2019s Jacob deGrom was in firm control for much of his outing, which ended abruptly in the eighth after Anthony Rendon\u2019s infield single and Juan Soto\u2019s two-run blast to right-center pulled Washington within 5-4. In seven innings, deGrom yielded four runs while striking out six.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nMets: 2B Robinson Can\u00f3 (torn left hamstring) was activated from the injured list less than a month after suffering what had the potential to be a season-ending injury. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say that I\u2019m surprised because I worked really hard,\u201d Can\u00f3 said. \u201cI\u2019m just happy to be back right now.\u201d\n\nNationals: An MRI revealed OF Adam Eaton has a bone bruise near his right knee. Eaton, who was injured Wednesday and left Monday\u2019s game after two innings when his knee stiffened, was available to pinch hit.\n\nCALLUPS\n\nWashington recalled INF Wilmer Difo from Triple-A Fresno and OF Michael A. Taylor from Double-A Harrisburg. Difo hit .300 with four homers and 30 RBIs after his mid-May demotion, while Taylor hit .248 with nine homers and 35 RBIs in 57 games for Harrisburg.\n\nMETS PROMOTIONS\n\nNew York promoted Bryn Alderson, son of former general manager Sandy Alderson, to professional scouting director and Jeff Lebow to assistant director of professional scouting. Lebow joined the Mets\u2018 organization in 2011, while Alderson did in 2012.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMets: RHP Zack Wheeler (9-7, 4.41 ERA), who is 0-2 with a 7.94 ERA in four starts against Washington this season, is set to start for New York.\n\nNationals: RHP Anibal Sanchez (8-6, 3.80), who is 8-0 with a 3.21 ERA in his last 16 starts, takes the hill as Washington concludes an eight-game homestand.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kurt Suzuki capped the largest ninth-inning comeback in Nationals franchise history with a game-ending, three-run homer, helping Washington score seven runs in its final at-bat to beat the New York Mets 11-10 Tuesday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/03/aptopix_mets_nationals_baseball_72709_c0-164-3907-2441_s1770x1032.jpg?4154ed200afae974a5821ce93b22d79c48c1f000"}
