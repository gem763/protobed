Those offices were also raided on October 1.\n\nMilano will decide whether to continue the investigation and ask for indictments, or drop it.\n\nThe AIF statement suggested that it believed Milano overstepped his jurisdiction with the search warrant, which was issued based on complaints from the Vatican bank and the office of the auditor general. It said the AIF's role in the deal was \"properly institutional in nature and conducted in conformity with the AIF's governing Statute\".\n\nIn 2014, the Vatican's Secretariat of State, the nerve centre of the bureaucracy of the 1.3 billion-member Roman Catholic Church, spent about $200m for a minority stake in a complex plan to buy a building in London's Chelsea district and convert it into luxury apartments, according to people familiar with the events.\n\nIn 2018, with London financial and real estate markets still rattled by the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union, the Secretariat of State bought the rest of the stake and became the outright owner, but took on some debt to refinance.\n\nSeveral Italian middlemen were involved in the operations, and the Italian magazine L'Espresso, which has published leaked documents, said they may have overcharged the Vatican.\n\nThis past June, the Secretariat of State, seeking to extinguish the mortgage, asked the Vatican bank - officially known as the Institute for Works of Religion (IOR) - for a bridge loan of 150 million euros ($167m) \"for institutional reasons\", but the bank refused.\n\nVatican sources are concerned that the investigation and the police raids could harm an upcoming evaluation of the Vatican's financial structures by MONEYVAL, a monitoring body of the Council of Europe.\n\nIn recent years MONEYVAL has given the AIF and Vatican financial reforms in general mostly positive evaluations. The next one is due in 2020.", "description": "In 2014, the Vatican's Secretariat of State spent about $200m for a minority stake in a plan to buy a London building.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/23/ce07ea8cb3f949f0b71edcb10a9ea7e1_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
