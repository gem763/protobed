Which makes me wonder: Whatever happened to his boast that the U.S. economy would be able to grow not only at 3% but at \u201c4%, 5% or even 6%\u201d per year?\n\nThe latest figures show the economy expanded 2.3% in the past year, exactly the same pace of the past 10 years since the Great Recession ended. With prospects for even slower growth ahead.\n\nLike so many of Trump\u2019s promises, his hopes and dreams have collided head-on with reality. It turns out that making the American economy great again wasn\u2019t nearly as easy as some politicians think.\n\nGOP flying high\n\nIt seems like a million years ago, but in December 2017, when Trump signed the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA), the Republicans were flying high. With the tax cut, they had accomplished a significant legislative victory on their top priority issue. They celebrated that the economy would be able to soar once more.\n\nAnd it did soar \u2014 a little bit, for a little while. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth hit 3.5% in the spring of 2018, and it seemed for a moment to some Republicans that Trump might have been correct about the incredible impact that the tax cuts could have.\n\nBut then reality hit. Growth throttled back to 2.9% and then to 1.1%. Since the tax cut went into effect, growth has averaged 2.5%, about the same as the 2.6% recorded in the six quarters before the tax cut was passed.\n\nAlmost every forecast from professional economists, the Federal Reserve, the Congressional Budget Office, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) \u2014 but not the White House! \u2014 looks for growth of around 2% per year for the foreseeable future. With the growth in the potential labor force slowing from about 1% per year to about 0.2%, it\u2019ll take some very good productivity numbers just to hit 2%.\n\nRipples in the water\n\nThe consensus is that the tax cut changed almost nothing. It was like throwing a boulder into a lake: A big splash, some waves, but very little change in the water level once things settled down. Jason Furman, Barack Obama\u2019s chief economist, says he and his co-author Robert Barro think the long-term impact of the tax cut will be to raise GDP by 0.04% per year.\n\nThat\u2019s very little bang for a $1 trillion tax cut. It gets us one-hundredth of the way to 6% growth.\n\nDespite evidence that the tax cut hasn\u2019t been the game-changer it promised, the White House is sticking to its forecast of 3% growth for the next 10 years.\n\nBut what do others say?\n\nThe American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington, is hosting an online bipartisan symposium (#TCJANowWhat) on the impact of the tax cut, with blog posts and papers from economists, tax and fiscal policy experts, and various other wonks culminating in a face-to-face event on Oct. 22.\n\nSo far, about all the conservatives in the debate can say is: Don\u2019t give up on the TCJA yet!\n\nIncentive to invest\n\nThe tax cut was supposed to supercharge economic growth by giving businesses the incentive to invest in the equipment, R&D, software and physical structures that would boost their productivity. We particularly need much faster productivity growth now, because the other ingredient for a bigger GDP \u2014 labor-force growth \u2014 is in short supply.\n\nBut the tax cut didn\u2019t have much lasting impact on business investment. In the six quarters since the tax cut passed, nonresidential fixed investment has increased at a 4.4% annual rate compared with a 4.7% pace in the six quarters prior to the tax cut.\n\nCorporations returned most of their windfall to their shareholders, rather than putting it back into the business. And other data from the Census Bureau show that the tax cut had one other predictable consequence: The rich got richer.\n\nOil lubricates the economy\n\nThe trade war with China (and the rest of the world) isn\u2019t the main cause of the growth slowdown. The consequences from tariffs and uncertainty could increase if tensions mount, but so far it\u2019s only taken away a few tenths from GDP. The slowdown is mostly a reversion to the mean, and a reaction to lower oil prices, which have a surprisingly negative impact on U.S. investment.\n\nIn the second quarter, business investment declined at a 1% annual rate, according to revised figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis released Thursday. That\u2019s the first decline since early 2016, when low oil prices were hammering U.S. investment, especially in oil drilling.\n\nThe same thing is happening now. Investments in oil fields and other mining facilities have declined 7.7% in the past year as the price of oil CL.1, -0.76% fell from $70 to the mid-$50s. Those investments surged 14% in 2018 when prices were rising.\n\nIt seems that the price of oil was a bigger factor than the tax cut in the recent rise and fall in business investment.\n\nAccording to Alexander Arnon of the Penn-Wharton Budget Model, the price of oil is now the key driver of business investment.\n\nIn his study, Arnon concluded that the rise in the price of oil from around $50 per barrel in late 2017 to $70 in late 2018 explains all of the growth in business investment in 2018, just as the drop in oil prices from over $100 in 2014 to near $30 in 2016 explained much of the decline in capital spending in those years.\n\nAll of this goes to show that making the economy great isn\u2019t easy. Even a $1 trillion tax cut and massive deficit spending could only provide a temporary boost to the growth rate. The ability of any president to make large improvements in our living standards is exaggerated.\n\nThe ability of a president to make things worse, however, is really the more relevant story today.\n\nRex Nutting is a MarketWatch columnist.", "description": "Whatever happened to Trump\u2019s boast that the U.S. economy would be able to grow not just at 3% but at \u201c4%, 5% or even 6%\u201d a year?", "authors": ["Rex Nutting"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS218__MGpng_ZG_20190927104801.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
