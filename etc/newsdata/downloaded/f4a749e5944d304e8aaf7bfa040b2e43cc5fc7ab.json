You should have called me the first time this happened.\u2019\n\nColeen had been setting a trap on her Instagram (Picture: Eamonn and James Clarke)\n\nColeen has had a tough year (Picture: Dave Thompson/ PA Archive)\n\nShe reposted the statement to Instagram, with the added caption: \u2018Can\u2019t believe I\u2019m even having to write this. I\u2019m pregnant & on holiday & am at a loss to why she would do this.\u2019\n\nBecky added she \u2018can\u2019t deal with this stress\u2019 while pregnant, as she suggested she was talking to lawyers.\n\nBecky is married to Jamie (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nRebekah is currently pregnant with her fifth child, her second with footballer Jamie. The WAG achieved further fame in 2017 when she appeared on I\u2019m A Celebrity\u2026 Get Me Out Of Here!\n\nShe and Coleen became pals as their husband played alongside each other for England.\n\nEarlier today Coleen admitted she\u2019d made up fake stories and posted them on her private Instagram, to see who was selling her out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018For a few years now someone I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing The Sun newspaper of my private posts and stories,\u2019 she wrote.\n\n\u2018There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family \u2013 all without my permission or knowledge. After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.\n\n\u2018To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except ONE account. (Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven\u2019t had stories on there for a while.)\u2019\n\nColeen continued: \u2018Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it\u2019s come from.\n\nThe Wags are at war (Picture: Rex Features)\n\n\u2018I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It\u2019s\u2026\u2026 Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColeen captioned the statement: \u2018This has been a burden in my life for a few years now and finally I have got to the bottom of it\u2026\u2026\u2019\n\nThe mum-of-four has yet to post the alleged screenshots.\n\nThe latest story Coleen alleges that Rebekah gave to the press was that her Cheshire home had flooded during Storm Lorenzo.\n\nThe report cited a source as saying that Coleen had pushed back the completion date on the renovation to the family home due to the damage.\n\nThe source said: \u2018The house is Wayne and Coleen\u2019s dream, so to see it being damaged has been horrible for them.\u2019\n\nColeen also cited a story from Heat magazine, claiming that the star wanted to return to television.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
