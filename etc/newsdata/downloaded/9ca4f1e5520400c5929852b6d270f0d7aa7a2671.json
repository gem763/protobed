The first online message? It was a typo", "language": "en", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nFifty years ago, two letters were transmitted online, forever altering the way that knowledge, information and communication would be exchanged.\n\nOn Oct. 29, 1969, Leonard Kleinrock, a professor of computer science at UCLA, and his graduate student Charley Kline wanted to send a transmission from UCLA's computer to another computer at Stanford Research Institute through ARPANET, the precursor to what we now know as the internet.\n\nARPANET connected universities working for the Department of Defense under its ARPA (now DARPA) program for new military technologies.\n\nIn 1969, only four universities had computers \u2014 which, Kline told OZY, were \"room-sized ... with under-floor air conditioning\" \u2014 connected to the network: UCLA, Stanford, University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) and the University of Utah.\n\nThe message sent by Kleinrock and Kline was intended to be \"login.\" Their system crashed, however, as soon as they typed the second letter. It took an hour to send the whole word, but by then, \"lo\" cemented its place in the internet's history. For Kleinrock, the message took on a completely different meaning, anyhow.\n\n\u201c\u2018L\u2019 and \u2018O\u2019 is \u2018hello,\u2019 and a more succinct, more powerful, more prophetic message we couldn\u2019t have wished for,\" he told OZY.\n\nTwo years later, in 1971, the first email was sent by MIT researcher Ray Tomlinson \u2014 which was also the first time the \"@\" sign was used to designate a specific recipient of a message.\n\nThe World Wide Web, as we know it now, didn't get invented until 1989, when British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the web and the technologies to access, create and share web pages. He published the first web page in 1991.\n\nBut many of the services and websites that define the modern internet were not created until years after its inception. Amazon didn't begin selling products until 1995, not as a one-stop emporium but, rather, as a virtual bookstore, Google's first search took place in 1998 and iTunes didn't launch until 2003.\n\nMeanwhile, today's largest social media network, Facebook, wasn't invented until 2004. YouTube raised its curtains in 2005, Twitter wasn't open for business until 2006 \u2014 and the White House created its account a year later. (The first tweet from the account wasn't sent until 2009.) Instagram started at the turn of the decade in 2010.\n\nFollow Joshua Bote on Twitter: @joshua_bote", "description": "Leonard Kleinrock, a UCLA computer science professor, and his student Charley Kline wanted to send a message.
