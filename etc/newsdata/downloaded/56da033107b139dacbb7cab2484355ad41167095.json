However, he denies distributing the methamphetamines, heroin and cocaine base that authorities also found at his home.\n\nU.S. border patrol originally launched the investigation into Bania\u2019s dealings after intercepting two packages from Belgium containing MDMA. Investigators were able to trace Bania\u2019s use of dark web distribution networks thanks to his transaction notebooks, which the court filings describe as \u201cmeticulous.\u201d\n\nSentencing is currently scheduled for Dec. 9.\n\nOther recent dark web prosecutions in the U.S.\n\nA couple in California pleaded guilty to similar charges in August, as Cointelegraph reported at the time.\n\nNear the end of July, a Florida man admitted to operating a massive opioid distribution network online. The court in that instance fined him over $4 million.", "description": "Following a guilty plea, a U.S. court has ordered a dark web drug dealer to give up over $150,000 in Bitcoin", "authors": ["Kollen Post"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9lMGE5ZGJmYmE1MmIwM2QzOTBhMWMyMmRiYzU4NzFjNi5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
