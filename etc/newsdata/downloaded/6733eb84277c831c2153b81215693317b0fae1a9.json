If (its) economy has the potential for recession, then that\u2019s a real game changer for ECB policy,\u201d said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda.\n\nWith euro zone inflation well below target, market participants are betting that the ECB will cut its rate on bank overnight deposits, its primary interest rate tool, for the first time since 2016 when it meets on Thursday.\n\nA slew of upbeat geopolitical news propelled stock markets to one-month highs last week and signs of resumption in the U.S.-China trade talks further brightened sentiment.\n\nHowever, mixed economic data from around the world has increased hopes of more stimulus by central banks to head off a global recession.\n\nMarkets were lifted on Friday after China said it would slash the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves, while U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank would continue to \u201cact as appropriate\u201d to sustain economic expansion.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The German share price index DAX graph is pictured at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, August 26, 2019.

Together, the stocks put the travel and leisure sector .SXTP on track for its worst day in nearly a month.\n\nCommodity-lined stocks .SXPP were the among biggest drag on the market, weighed down by a decline in base metal and iron ore prices.\n\nGermany's trade-sensitive DAX index .GDAXI was trading flat.
