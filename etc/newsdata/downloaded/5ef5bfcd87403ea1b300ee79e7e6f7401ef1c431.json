Elizabeth Warren speaks at a campaign rally at Keene State College in Keene, N.H., September 25, 2019. (Brian Snyder/Reuters)\n\nNational Review\u2019s Zachary Evans reports that \u201cSenator Elizabeth Warren called for placing transgender prisoners in detention facilities designed for the opposite sex in a new LGBTQ rights plan released Thursday.\u201d She describes the decision to segregate prisoners according to their biological sex (their sex established at or before birth) as \u201cdangerous.\u201d Similarly, she has said that taxpayers will fund sex-change surgeries for inmates.\n\nHer announcement of these plans comes ahead of a LGBTQ town hall debate today, hosted by both the Human Rights Campaign and CNN, where we can all look forward to even more policy proposals throwing women and children under the bus.\n\nThe Women\u2019s Liberation Front, feminists who believe in the importance of biological sex, gave the following statement to National Review:\n\nWe at WoLF are very disappointed to hear that so many of our representatives are coming out in favor of allowing men like Michelle Kosilek, formerly Robert Kosilek, to demand to be house alongside incarcerated, frequently traumatized women. Women in prison are frequently impoverished, single mothers, abuse victims, or are racially marginalized, sometimes all at once. They don\u2019t need an apparently unrepentant wife-strangler sleeping in the next bunk. These women can\u2019t vote, and they don\u2019t have multi-million-dollar advocacy efforts amplifying their fears about having to share their living quarters and showers with violent men. Our elected officials should not be shoving the government\u2019s failure to make male prisons safe for nonconforming men off onto vulnerable women, whose rights and safety the ACLU and Human Rights Campaign have demanded be sacrificed on the altar of gender identity.", "description": "2020 Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren claims it is \"dangerous\" to separate prisoners according to biological sex.", "authors": ["Madeleine Kearns", "Victor Davis Hanson", "Jim Geraghty", "John Mccormack", "A.
