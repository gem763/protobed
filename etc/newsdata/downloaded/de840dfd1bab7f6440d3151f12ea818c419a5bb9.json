Larger ones include specialist charities such as StepChange or Christians Against Poverty.\n\nIn some cases they can help to get debts written off completely or they can help to negotiate with creditors to allow things like repayment holidays or reduced repayments.\n\nThe right strategy will depend on the level and nature of your debts, but it is well worth talking to a debt counsellor who might be able to come up with ideas that you had not thought of.\n\nOne final point is that if you are in employment, especially with a large firm, you might find that your employer is far more supportive than you would expect.\n\nSome workplaces have 'employee assistance programmes' where staff can get confidential support on a range of areas.\n\nOther firms are very focused on the 'financial well-being' of their staff because workers with money worries may not be as productive at work.\n\nAlthough it can be embarrassing talking about your financial problems to your employer, you may find that you get a more positive response than you expected.\n\nAll of these avenues are worth pursuing \u2013 and exhausting \u2013 before contemplating taking 'unauthorised' funds out of your pension.", "description": "I have fallen on hard times and run up a lot of personal debt.
