Royal Mint bosses have been accused of sexism for rejecting plans to honour novelist sisters Emily and Charlotte Bronte with special coins\n\nAccording to the committee minutes, obtained by this newspaper under the Freedom of Information Act, members thought the honour would be \u2018inappropriate\u2019 because they had already rejected the idea of a coin to mark the bicentenary of her sister\u2019s birth two years earlier.\n\nThe board, chaired by former Tory Cabinet Minister Lord Waldegrave, above, comprised ten men and three women when it met in 2016\n\nThe minutes state: \u2018It was accepted that if her sister had not been commemorated in a previous year then it would be inappropriate to issue a coin for Emily.\u2019\n\nDetails of the snub come just two months after The Mail on Sunday revealed that the committee had decided not to honour children\u2019s author Enid Blyton on the grounds that she was a \u2018racist homophobe, who was not well regarded as a writer\u2019.\n\nBut there would be no such controversy surrounding the Bronte sisters as Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre, both of which were published in 1847, are among the most celebrated novels ever written.\n\nAuthor Dame Margaret Drabble said: \u2018It seems strange that two of the most important and influential writers in the English language should have been overlooked in this way and for such flimsy reasons.\n\n\u2018Their significance is beyond question so you can\u2019t help but wonder if this shows a reluctance to take women seriously. Emily would look particularly wonderful \u2013 her otherworldly profile like a Greek goddess would be very striking.\u2019\n\nFellow writer Kathy Lette said women were being \u2018photoshopped out of the cultural narrative\u2019, adding: \u2018Blokes suffer from sexist Alzheimer\u2019s where women of substance are concerned.\u2019\n\nThe Royal Mint rejected any suggestion of sexism. A spokesman pointed out they have a female chief executive and said the Brontes may be honoured on a coin in the future.\n\nShe added: \u2018Women have featured prominently on UK coins for centuries \u2013 including monarchs and the image of Britannia.\u2019", "description": "The Mint's advisory committee on commemorative coins was accused of failing to 'take women seriously' after snubbing the authors of Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre.", "authors": ["Chris Hastings Arts Correspondent For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/21/20225684-0-image-a-9_1572122551576.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
