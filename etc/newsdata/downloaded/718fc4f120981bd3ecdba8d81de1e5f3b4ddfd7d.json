Son remains in custody in South Korea where he was convicted, while his indictment was unsealed Wednesday.\n\nSon operated a Darknet, or encrypted online content, market that was hidden from traditional search engines to distribute more than 1 million explicit videos involving children, while accepting Bitcoin as currency. Agents from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigation Division reportedly were able to determine the location of the Darknet server, which led to Son's arrest. They were then able to \"de-anonymize\" the Bitcoin transactions on the site to unmask many of the site's users.\n\nBloomberg notes that child pornography is a crime that's increasing at a rapid rate around the globe in part because of the rise of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which allow transactions to remain anonymous.
