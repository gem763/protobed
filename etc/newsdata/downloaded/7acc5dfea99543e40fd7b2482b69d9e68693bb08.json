Soon, QAnon fans believe, Trump will team up with the military to throw top Democrats like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama into Guantanamo Bay.\n\nBut what QAnon believers actually believe is constantly changing. After taking advantage of the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich and promoting dangerous ideas like Pizzagate, QAnon supporters have found a new tragedy to exploit: the death of John F. Kennedy Jr., son of the late president.\n\nUntil July, QAnon supporters believed that \u201cQ,\u201d the anonymous online forum poster whose cryptic clues make up the conspiracy theory, was a high-ranking Trump administration official, or maybe even Trump himself. But now, a good portion of QAnon believers have become convinced that Q is none other than JFK Jr, even though he died in a plane crash nearly 20 years ago.\n\nJuly was a rough month for QAnon followers. After making a post on July 4, Q didn\u2019t leave any clues for 20 days, marking the longest gap between Q hints since the scheme began in late October 2017. That left QAnon believers without much to do, leaving their imaginations to run even wilder than usual. It also meant that anyone who wanted to sway the often very gullible people who believe in QAnon had a chance to sway them in a new direction.\n\nAround the middle of July, a new figure named \u201cR\u201d appeared in the 8Chan forum devoted to QAnon \u201cresearch.\u201d (\u201cR\u201d is the letter in the alphabet after \u201cQ.\u201d) The anonymous poster, who was soon dubbed \u201cRanon,\u201d posited that Kennedy hadn\u2019t actually died in a plane crash off the coast of Massachusetts. Instead, he\u2019d faked his death to avoid the supposed deep-state cabal that is at the center of QAnon and teamed up with Trump to kick off a decades-long strategy. While Trump had laid the groundwork for his presidential bid, QAnon believers posited, Kennedy had become Q.\n\n\u201c Soon, QAnon fans believe, Trump will team up with the military to throw top Democrats like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama into Guantanamo Bay. \u201d\n\nThe idea that Kennedy and his wife were alive and living under pseudonyms added an unstable new element to a conspiracy theory that has already inspired an armed man to shut down a road near the Hoover Dam and encouraged QAnon believers to help fund a bizarre vigilante \u201csex trafficking\u201d operation in Arizona.\n\nYouTube videos about the new theory have garnered hundreds of thousands of views. On Reddit, QAnon supporters wondered about the portents behind Trump meeting Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on July 16, the anniversary of Kennedy\u2019s death. One popular YouTube video claimed that QAnon had proven \u201chow JFK JR was revealed to be ALIVE.\u201d On 8Chan, believers launched a new board devoted to considering the theory that Kennedy was still alive. Amazon T-shirt vendors began selling shirts that said \u201cJFK Jr. = R.\u201d\n\nIncredibly, QAnon believers claim Kennedy has even appeared in public at Trump rallies, posing as just another Trumpite. They latched onto a picture of a bearded, middle-aged man in glasses standing in the stands behind Trump at one rally, claiming that the man was actually Kennedy in disguise.\n\nIn fact, the man looks nothing like Kennedy. But QAnon supporters ran wild with the theory anyway, trying to use facial aging programs to prove that he was Kennedy, who would be 57 today.\n\n\u201cJFK Jr was not a stupid man he KNEW what they did to his father,\u201d one well-received Reddit thread read, claiming that the man at the Trump rally was \u201cblatantly\u201d disguised.\n\nQAnon believers began sifting through details of the man\u2019s life for proof that he was actually Kennedy. They looked at the people standing next to him at the rally, suspecting that another rally attendee was Kennedy\u2019s wife, Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, who was also killed in the crash. They analyzed the man\u2019s name for clues and saw one in footage of the man near a DoubleTree hotel\u2014as in body \u201cdouble.\u201d\n\nIn late July, whatever person or group is behind \u201cQ\u201d returned to posting and denounced \u201cR,\u201d its newfound rival for impressionable Trump supporters. Still, the Kennedy theory persists among a segment of QAnon believers. On Wednesday, a day after the Trump rally in Tampa, QAnon supporters online were once again analyzing pictures of rally attendees for \u201cproof\u201d that the Kennedys are still alive.", "description": "Believers used to think someone close to Trump was leaving them clues to the president\u2019s plan to defeat the deep state.
