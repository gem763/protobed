Sign up here.\n\nChina\u2019s slowdown is deepening just as risks for the global economy mount, piling pressure on the authorities to do more to support growth.\n\nIndustrial output rose 4.4% from a year earlier in August, the lowest for a single month since 2002, while retail sales came in below expectations. Fixed-asset investment slowed to 5.5% in the first eight months, with the private sector lagging state investment for the 6th month.\n\nThe data add support to the argument that policy makers\u2019 efforts to brake the slowing economy aren\u2019t sufficient as the nation grapples with structural downward pressure at home, the risk of yet-higher tariffs on exports to the U.S. and now surging oil prices. Nomura International Ltd. said this all raises the likelihood that the People\u2019s Bank of China will cut its medium-term lending rate on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIn terms of policy room, we still think there\u2019s quite a lot for both the Ministry of Finance and the PBOC, but now it\u2019s a matter of whether they want to use it,\u201d Helen Qiao, chief Greater China economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said on Bloomberg television. \u201cWhat I worry about is that policy makers are hesitating at the moment because of the potential implications on the long term impact, so they\u2019re really fallen behind the curve.\u201d\n\nThe Shanghai Composite swung between gains and losses before closing slightly lower. Futures contracts on China\u2019s 10-year government bond regained losses after the data release to close at 0.07% higher on Monday.\n\nThe slowdown in output was almost across the board, with food processing and general equipment manufacturing unchanged from last year. Car output rose after declining for four months. Growth in sales of consumer goods slowed to 7.2%, the lowest since April this year, but there was an increase in food sales. The unemployment rate fell to 5.2% from 5.3% in July, within the narrow band it has occupied all year even amid the slowdown.\n\nThe record oil price surge after a strike on a Saudi Arabian oil facility couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time for China and a world economy already in the grip of a deepening downturn. While the severity of the impact will depend on how long the oil price spike endures, it risks further eroding fragile business and consumer confidence amid the ongoing U.S.-China dispute and already slowing global demand.\n\nSaudi Arabia is the largest single source of China\u2019s crude oil imports, which in turn supply about 70% of total demand.\n\nAfter China\u2019s data release on Monday by the National Bureau of Statistics, Citigroup Inc. lowered its growth forecast for the world\u2019s second-biggest economy to 6.2% for this year from 6.3% previously, and to 5.8% from 6% for 2020.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect a growth rebound in the fourth quarter anymore, with the new forecast flat at 6.1% year on year,\u201d wrote Yu Xiangrong, a Hong Kong-based economist with Citigroup, referring to the quarterly outlook. \u201cIn particular, we now hold a more cautious view on the recovery of infrastructure investment and retail sales.\u201d\n\nThe People\u2019s Bank of China cut the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves this month to the lowest level since 2007, though it\u2019s still holding off on cutting borrowing costs more broadly.\n\nSome 265 billion yuan ($37.5 billion) of 1-year loans from the PBOC to banks will mature on Tuesday. The central bank will likely roll-over at least some of these, giving it an opportunity to cut the rate it charges.\n\nAnalysts are divided on whether the PBOC would actually take the chance to cut. Some see the need for more significant easing while the other argue the authorities would like to avoid announcing multiple stimulus at once, and they\u2019ll watch the U.S. Federal Reserve before taking any actions themselves. The Fed is expected to cut rates this week.\n\nMorgan Stanley expects borrowing costs to be cut by 10-15 basis points as early as this week, likely in the form of an medium-term lending rate cut.\n\nWhat Bloomberg\u2019s Economists Say..\n\n\u201cWe expect policy support to continue at a measured pace as Chinese authorities strive to put a floor under the slowing economy. Yet, officials are bracing for a long war, and are careful not to deplete their policy ammunition.\u201d-- Chang Shu and David Qu, Bloomberg EconomicsFor the full note click here\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.\u00a0Sign up here.\u00a0China\u2019s slowdown is deepening just as risks for the global economy mount, piling pressure on the authorities to do more to support growth.Industrial output rose 4.4% from a year earlier in", "authors": ["Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5Mm5JiLeyH1b4WaJdc9KGw--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/24acbf356aaede033f379cd085c469bf", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
