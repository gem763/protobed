Authorities had to call in backhoes to fully excavate the pit.\n\nOn Tuesday, the experts said that after a week of study, they had been able to piece together 13 complete bodies, 16 partial bodies, six heads and six body trunks that correspond to different people.\n\n'A smell of death': Mexico's truck of corpses highlights drug war crisis Read more\n\nThe pit was first located in early September, when residents reported fetid odors and flies around the rural site.\n\nQuick guide Mexico's war on drugs Show Hide Why did Mexico launch its war on drugs? On 10 December 2006, Felipe Calder\u00f3n launched Mexico\u2019s war on drugs by sending 6,500 troops into his home state of Michoac\u00e1n, where rival cartels were engaged in tit-for-tat massacres. Calder\u00f3n declared war eight days after taking power \u2013 a move widely seen as an attempt to boost his own legitimacy after a bitterly contested election victory. Within two months, around 20,000 troops were involved in operations. What has the war cost so far? The US has donated at least $1.5bn through the Merida Initiative since 2008, while Mexico spent at least $54bn on security and defence between 2007 and 2016. Critics say that this influx of cash has helped create an opaque security industry open to corruption.\n\n\n\nBut the biggest costs have been human: since 2007, over 250,000 people have been murdered, more than 40,000 reported as disappeared and 26,000 unidentified bodies in morgues across the country. Human rights groups have also detailed a vast rise in human rights abuses including torture, extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances by state security forces.\n\n\n\nPe\u00f1a Nieto claimed to have killed or detained 110 of 122 of his government's most wanted narcos. But his biggest victory \u2013 and most embarrassing blunder \u2013 was the recapture, escape, another recapture and extradition of Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, leader of the Sinaloa cartel.\n\nMexico\u2019s decade-long war on drugs would never have been possible without the injection of American cash and military cooperation under the Merida Initiative. The funds have continued to flow despite indisputable evidence of human rights violations.\n\n\n\nUnder new president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, murder rates are up and a new security force, the Civil Guard, is being deployed onto the streets despite campaign promises to end the drug war. What has been achieved? Improved collaboration between the US and Mexico has resulted in numerous high-profile arrests and drug busts. Officials say 25 of the 37 drug traffickers on Calder\u00f3n\u2019s most-wanted list have been jailed, extradited to the US or killed, although not all of these actions have been independently corroborated. The biggest victory \u2013 and most embarrassing blunder \u2013 under Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s leadership was the recapture, escape and another recapture of Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, leader of the Sinaloa cartel. While the crackdown and capture of kingpins has won praise from the media and US, it has done little to reduce the violence.

In May, the remains of at least 34 people were found at two separate properties in Jalisco.\n\nIn March, workers were removing mud and debris to clear a storm drain at another spot on the outskirts of Guadalajara, when they began finding plastic bags with the odor of dead bodies.\n\nIn the end, they pulled a total of 20 bodies out of the storm drain.", "description": "Tests continue on contents of 119 plastic bags found in Jalisco as clandestine burial sites have become common during country\u2019s drug war", "authors": ["Associated Press In Mexico City"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e851f70f9f8496787ff5a706578ecab3b3f1187/0_3_3427_2057/master/3427.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=572f31884906a95513b584eba102a6da", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
