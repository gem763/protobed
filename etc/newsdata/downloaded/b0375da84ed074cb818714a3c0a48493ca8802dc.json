Weed collapsed on the midway at the Great Frederick Fair after Friday evening\u2019s attack by brothers who are 15 and 16 years old, authorities said.\n\nWeed refused to give the boys a dollar, they had words back and forth, and the 16-year-old brother punched Weed in the back of the head, prosecutors said. The 15-year-old rushed forward and delivered the fatal blow, according to authorities, who said one boy spat on the unconscious Weed before walking away.\n\nWeed died the next day at a Baltimore hospital that specializes in traumatic injuries. Both teens have been charged as juveniles with assault. Juvenile suspect names are not released.\n\nInvestigators are trying to determine whether others were involved and whether the circumstances would warrant seeking adult or more serious charges against the brothers, Frederick state\u2019s attorney spokesman Will Cockey said Tuesday.\n\nIn a news conference Monday that was streamed online by WJLA, State\u2019s Attorney Charlie Smith called the attack \u201cunprovoked.\u201d He also told reporters there was no evidence a hate crime had been committed or that either of the teenagers had been participating in the \u201cknockout game,\u201d which involves targeting unsuspecting passersby with sucker punches.\n\n\u201cThis is all over a couple kids asking this man for a dollar, and there was something that broke bad after that,\u201d Smith told reporters.\n\nUnder state law, prosecutors would have to obtain court approval to try the 15-year-old as an adult for manslaughter, Smith said. To do so would require a waiver hearing.\n\nThe teens have been held at the Alfred D. Noyes Children\u2019s Center, a juvenile detention center in Rockville, since their arrest late Friday. The older brother has been charged with second-degree assault; the younger one is facing first- and second-degree assault charges, along with reckless endangerment.\n\nA circuit court judge declined to release them to their parents following a hearing Monday.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Two brothers, 15 and 16, were held in the fatal punching of man at the Frederick County fair.", "authors": ["Fredrick Kunkle", "General Assignment Reporting", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
