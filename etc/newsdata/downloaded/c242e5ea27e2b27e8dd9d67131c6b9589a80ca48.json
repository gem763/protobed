It is set down for November 26.\n\nIn July, during an appearance in the Johannesburg Specialised Commercial Crimes Court, his legal team again cited the \"substantially pregnant\" Shanice as a reason why he should be granted bail and be allowed to travel to Dubai.\n\nZuma, the son of the former president, has been charged with corruption, alternatively conspiracy to commit corruption, relating to the alleged R600m offer made to Jonas in 2015 by Ajay Gupta in his presence.\n\nHe was released on R100 000 bail at the time.\n\nNews24 understands that Zuma will welcome his first child with Shanice in the next few weeks.\n\n\"While one appreciates that people have lives to run... one must balance that against the challenge that would arise if the commission would in any way run on the basis that every witness must appear on a date that suits him or her,\" Zondo said in granting Jonas' postponement.\n\n\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "Duduzane Zuma has been left frustrated.
