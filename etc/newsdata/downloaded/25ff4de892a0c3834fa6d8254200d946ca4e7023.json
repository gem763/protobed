But his statement appears to have been prompted by concerns remaining staff at ThinkProgress had that the site would no longer function as an editorially independent arm of CAP but, instead, as a sounding board for scholars at the think tank. Ex-staffers noted that under the new system, the union workers who had populated thinkprogress.org with content would be replaced with non union workers; and that part of their actual union contract established editorial independence.\n\nWithin hours of Gordon issuing his statement, a spokesman for CAP said that they were shelving plans to keep the site running and would instead have it archived. The spokesperson also said that CAP would be ending the recurring donations feature for ThinkProgress supporters, which had also been a point of contention with union members, who believed that those donors should not have been required to opt-out of giving their recurring donations.\n\nThe potential for a legal challenge over the manner in which ThinkProgress has been shut down creates additional headaches for leadership at CAP, which is the predominant Democratic think tank in Washington D.C. and one of the more prominent advocates for unions and union workers. And it remains to be seen whether CAP\u2019s decision to archive the site and end the recurring donor feature will prove satisfactory for ThinkProgress alum.\n\nFeelings remain raw over the manner in which the site had been shut down. CAP officials informed the remaining employees on Friday that a months-long search for a new publisher had come up empty and that the website would no longer function as an editorially-independent entity going forward.\n\nThe announcement face blowback from several staffers and alum who noted that ThinkProgress, once one of the top news entities in the progressive ecosystem, had experienced budget shortfalls every year of its existence with no threat of closure.\n\nBut in the statement on Monday night, the CAP spokesman reiterated that the current fiscal outlook was far worse than those in the past, noting that the budget deficit had \u201cexpanded from $700,000 to $2,500,000.\u201d\n\n\u201cThroughout an extensive process over many months, we were as transparent as possible with ThinkProgress staff,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cIn just the last eight years, CAP and CAPAF made an investment of over $11 million in ThinkProgress because of its important work. However, over several months we worked to find a new publisher, and unfortunately we found no one willing to take on ThinkProgress. At that point we were faced with a choice between shelving the site altogether or finding some productive value in using it with existing staff to hold the current corrupt occupant of the White House accountable. We felt that opting for the latter was the greater good, given the existential crisis our nation faces, and communicated that to staff and in public statements on Friday.\u201d\n\nAs noted in Gordon\u2019s statement, CAP did agree to severance packages beyond what ThinkProgress employees\u2014who ratified their Writers Guild of America, East contract in July 2016\u2014had negotiated. All told, the 11 staffers who lost their jobs last week will receive twelve weeks of pay coupled with health insurance coverage through the end of the year.", "description": "The recently closed progressive news site will no longer exist as a sounding board for think tank scholars after union complaints.", "authors": ["Gideon Resnick", "Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568084689/190909-resnick-think-progress-tease_xpwhju", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
