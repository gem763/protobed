USA TODAY\n\nProcter & Gamble brand Always is removing the Venus symbol, commonly used to designate \"female,\" from the packaging around its sanitary pads in an effort to be more inclusive.\n\n\"For over 35 years Always has championed girls and women, and we will continue to do so,\" the company told USA TODAY Wednesday. \"We\u2019re also committed to diversity and inclusion and are on a continual journey to understand the needs of all of our consumers.\"\n\nThe statement continued, \"We routinely assess our products, packaging, and designs, taking into account a variety of inputs including in depth consumer research, to ensure we are meeting the needs of everyone who uses our products. The change to our pad wrapper design is consistent with that practice.\"\n\nThe change will apply to the wrapping on sanitary pads, not the outer packaging on products, according to the company.\n\nMore: Can using organic tampons and pads make your period shorter?\n\nMore: People don't talk about periods.

As do cis women who despise overly feminine products,\" one person explained. \"Cis women who can\u2019t menstruate and trans women are harmed by the assumption that menstruation defines femininity. Less ink for printing better for planet. This is a win all around.\"\n\n\"So proud of @Always for this move to respect #transgender people,\" another person tweeted.\n\nThe updated design will be adapted by multiple markets, a spokesperson confirms. Exact dates for the design update remain unclear.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2019/10/23/always-remove-female-symbol-period-pads-more-inclusive/4072249002/", "description": "Procter & Gamble brand Always is removing the Venus, or female, symbol from its menstrual pad packaging in an effort to be more inclusive to all customers.", "authors": ["Sara M Moniuszko", "Published P.M.
