Richard Nixon, after a bipartisan vote for impeachment in the House Judiciary Committee on which I then sat, resigned in the face of overwhelming evidence and the certainty of both impeachment by the whole House and conviction by the Senate.", "description": "In 1974, the House Judiciary Committee did not rush, but weighed the evidence on many kinds of misconduct and carefully built its case.
