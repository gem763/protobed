Local government is where indeed the needs of our people are felt the most,\u201d Motlanthe said.\n\nHe added that focus was also on local economies.\n\nRead: SA needs to ditch the \u2018business as usual\u2019 approach \u2013 Motlanthe\n\n\u201cA significant part of the local economy is in the informal sector. Accordingly, we must support the sector by ensuring that micro financing facilities are readily available and accessible in localities,\u201d he said.\n\nMotlanthe said in the recent past, the political component at local government, which is made up of councillors and the council, was overreaching and getting involved in the administration of local government. \u201cThis has resulted in the blurring of the lines of accountability, he said.\n\nHe called for the establishment of a local government independent of politics.\n\n\u201cThe state must outlast the term of [office of] politicians. It must not only be able to collect revenue but also have programmes that grow sustainable local economies,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAn effective local state must not only provide basic needs and service but also develop mechanisms that generate income without placing an additional tax [burden] on the local citizens.\n\nThe forum will continue throughout the weekend.", "description": "The Kgalema Motlanthe Foundation\u2019s Dialogue Among Equals kicked off at the Champagne Sports Resort in the Central Drakensberg, KwaZulu-Natal on Friday.", "authors": ["Sthembiso Lebuso"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7913/e81658a26d7745429ec1ae0f7e4e31f6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
