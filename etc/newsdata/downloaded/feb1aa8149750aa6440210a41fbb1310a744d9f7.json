Its record over the last four decades suggests we pay attention to it.\n\nThis obscure indicator focuses on the divergence between the University of Michigan\u2019s Consumer Sentiment Index and the Conference Board\u2019s Consumer Confidence Index. Both are widely reported, and many investors view them as interchangeable.\n\nBut James Stack, editor of the InvesTech Research newsletter, says that there are times when the two measures diverge and that these divergences are significant.\n\nLike now.\n\nThe reason these two indices diverge, according to Stack, is that even though they broadly measure the same things, there are important differences. The University of Michigan survey more closely reflects U.S. consumers\u2019 attitudes towards their immediate personal circumstances, he asserts, whereas the Conference Board index reflects consumers\u2019 attitudes towards the overall economy generally. For example, the Conference Board\u2019s survey, but not the University of Michigan\u2019s, reflects confidence about job prospects in one\u2019s region.\n\nWith the U.S. unemployment rate at a 50-year low, it therefore isn\u2019t surprising that the Conference Board\u2019s index paints a rosier picture. Stack argues that the divergence between the two indices means that, while consumers are beginning to worry about their own personal situations, they remain confident about the overall economy.\n\nWhat significance does all this have for the economy\u2019s prospects? Stack believes that wide divergences are typical of what happens prior to a recession, and his belief has support from the historical data \u2014, as you can see from the accompanying chart, which plots a composite indicator calculated by subtracting the Conference Board\u2019s Consumer Confidence Index from the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment reading.\n\nNotice that this composite indicator typically reaches a low prior to recessions, and that it currently is lower than at any other time since 1979 (which is when the Conference Board began updating its index on a monthly basis).\n\nTo be sure, with just five recessions since 1979, there are too few data points to support a statistically robust conclusion. But, as Stack puts it, the current record low reading of the composite indicator definitely has he and his analysts \u201cscratching our analytical heads.\u201d He adds that the reading \u201ccarries a pre-recession warning risk.\u201d\n\nAt a minimum, this indicator suggests we pay close attention to the Conference Board\u2019s Consumer Confidence Index in coming months. If and when it starts to decline significantly, and thereby join the University of Michigan\u2019s Consumer Sentiment Index in telling the same story of a less-confident consumer, then history suggests that a recession is that much closer.\n\nMark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch.
