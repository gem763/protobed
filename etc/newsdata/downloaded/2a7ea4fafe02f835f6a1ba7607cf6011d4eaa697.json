I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to us for hope. How dare you!\n\n\u201cYou have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words . . . We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is the money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!\u201d\n\nHer words and demeanor are those of a totalitarian dictator. She says people who don\u2019t act on climate change are \u201cevil.\u201d The United Nations and Congress should never have given her their platforms.\n\nShe has taken literally what irresponsible adults have told her, that the planet is going to end in 11 years unless we stop using fossil fuels.\n\nHer parents and the climate industry have exploited her youthful idealism and rigid obsessions. They have frightened her out of her mind and now are exposing her to condemnation and ridicule.\n\nThey should be ashamed of themselves.\n\nThey have indoctrinated her into believing a childish fantasy, one that has captured the imagination of millions of susceptible children all around the world, and is causing them to suffer, like Greta, what psychologists call eco-anxiety.\n\nOne British report found growing numbers of children and young adults are being treated with psychiatric drugs to alleviate climate anxiety.\n\nSome are so certain the planet has no future that they\u2019ve sworn off ever having children.\n\nAs irresponsible adult Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told her 2.5 million Instagram followers this year, it is \u201clegitimate\u201d for young people afraid of climate change to ask, \u201cIs it OK to still have children?\u201d\n\nTerrifying children with exaggerated stories about the threat of climate change is a deliberate strategy of eco-totalitarians. It is child abuse.\n\nWhat Greta does not understand is that it also is a deliberate ploy by climate alarmists to \u00adadvance their hidden agenda of destroying capitalism.\n\nAOC\u2019s former chief of staff let the cat out of the bag last week about her Green New Deal:\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t originally a climate thing at all . . . we really think of it as a how-do-you-change-the-entire-economy,\u201d Saikat Chakrabarti told The Washington Post.\n\nFor Thunberg the fear is debilitating. She has spoken of her Asperger\u2019s syndrome, a form of high-functioning autism, as a \u00ad\u201csuperpower\u201d but also she has suffered depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, severe anxiety, selective mutism and an eating disorder, after being fed climate propaganda at school at age 8 about starving polar bears.\n\nSo you have to admire the personal courage and integrity that have brought her to noisy, busy New York and forced her onto a very public stage. It does not come easily and clearly takes an emotional toll.\n\nThe kind way to deal with her anxiety would be to tell her that her belief that the world is going to end in 2030 is not supported by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report released last year.\n\nThe kind way to calm her down would be to introduce her to sanguine scientists like British atmospheric chemist Scott Archer-Nicholls of Cambridge University, no climate skeptic, who recently told Physics World:\n\n\u201cThe world is not going to suddenly end in 2030 if we don\u2019t reduce carbon-dioxide emissions . . . One of my main worries with this [extinction] messaging is that it can give people the false impression that if we fail to address it soon, there will be a cliff-edge disaster, and that these views might fuel anxiety and depression or lead to rash decision-making.\u201d\n\nGreta is on the verge of hysteria now. How will she react when her demands are not met? They won\u2019t and can\u2019t be met. The planet is not going to end in 2030 and we will still be using fossil fuels, which underpin human progress and have dragged 1 billion people out of poverty in the past two decades.\n\nKid\u2019s rights trans cend ma/pa\u2019s\n\nOne thing the British Supreme Court got right this week was a decision to compel a transgender man to register as \u201cmother\u201d and not \u201cfather\u201d on his baby\u2019s birth certificate. The judges decided the child\u2019s right to know the truth of its origins trumped Freddy McConnell\u2019s new male identity.\n\n\u201cMotherhood was established by the act of giving birth,\u201d says the commonsense judgment.\n\nLet\u2019s hope the Democrats pushing abortion rights for men will see sense, too.\n\nDelta\u2019s top-flight pit bull ban\n\nWell done to Delta Air Lines for continuing its ban on pit bulls in defiance of absurd Transportation Department guidelines.\n\nThey are dangerous dogs bred for fighting, as poor Marlin Jackson found when he was mauled on a Delta flight in 2017 by an emotional-support pit bull.\n\nEmotional-support animals on airplanes are inconvenient, at best, if not unsanitary. With more than 700,000 flying around the country each year, and rising, it\u2019s clear the system is being abused by people too cheap to pay for their pet to travel in the hold.", "description": "Nothing about the growing global stature of the fanatical Swedish teenage eco-catastro\u00adphist is healthy \u2014 for her or for the millions of little girls she inspires and frightens in equal measure.", "authors": ["Miranda Devine", "September"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/greta-thunberg-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
