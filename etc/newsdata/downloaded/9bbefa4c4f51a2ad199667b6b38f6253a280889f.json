I would love to fall in love and have more children.\n\n\"Now I'd love to meet someone... This series is so genuine and how I feel about being single. I'm 30 this year and I've put a lot of pressure on myself on finding someone, I wanna meet someone and I want to marry you.\n\n\"I go from zero to 100. Now I just need to take the pedal off, get back on the dating scene. I'm hoping to meet someone, I want to meet someone for me first.\n\n(Image: ITV/REX)\n\n\"But I have Sunday, we come as a package, a lovely package.\"\n\nAlthough she is eventually dating to find someone who will make a suitable father figure, Ferne admitted the man has got to be \"someone for me first\".\n\nThe TV star set out it's important she really fancies and likes someone for it to be worth tearing her away from her daughter for a few hours.\n\nShe added: \"They've got to be someone for me first. See where it goes.\n\n\"Dating is not coming on well. I'm not going to lie. I wouldn't say I'm unlucky in love. I want to have someone I really fancy and like to spend time away from Sunday.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"I've been on a few dates but there is no one I've felt I want to make this serious.\"\n\nFerne hit headlines last year for her flirtation with Love Island's Charlie Brake and although it featured on her show, the romance fizzled out fairly quickly.\n\nMore recently, she shared a steamy smooch with this year's Love Island star Jordan Hames but she insisted it was a \"one night snog\".\n\nShe said: \"It was a one night snog and it was comical.\"\n\nAnd while Ferne is looking for love, she enthused she loves being a single parent.\n\nCameras follow Ferne as she takes motherhood in her stride for First Time Mum series four.\n\nThe mother-of-one said she has finally nailed juggling her work commitments with her parenting.\n\nFirst Time Mum returns to screens Wednesday at 9pm on ITVBe.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: As First Time Mum returns for series four, Ferne dishes her hopes on finding a man suitable to be a dad", "authors": ["Lily Waddell", "Image", "Itv Rex", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20756902.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Fern-McCann-First-Time-Mum-TV-Show-Series-4-Episode-1-UK-30-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
