And in northern California, 90% of the giant bull kelp forests have been devoured by the urchins, perhaps never to return.\n\nVast \u201curchin barrens\u201d \u2013 stretches of denuded seafloor dotted with nothing but hundreds of the spiny orbs \u2013 have spread to coastal Oregon, where kelp forests were once so thick it was impossible to navigate some areas by boat.\n\nYou can\u2019t just go out and smash them. There\u2019s too many. I don\u2019t know what we can do Scott Groth, shellfish scientist\n\nThe underwater annihilation is killing off important fisheries for red abalone and red sea urchins and creating such havoc that scientists in California are partnering with a private business to collect the over-abundant purple urchins and \u201cranch\u201d them in a controlled environment for sale to a global seafood market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in uncharted territory,\u201d said Scott Groth, a shellfish scientist with the Oregon department of fish and wildlife. \u201cYou can\u2019t just go out and smash them. There\u2019s too many. I don\u2019t know what we can do.\u201d\n\nThe explosion of purple sea urchins is the latest symptom of a Pacific north-west marine ecosystem that\u2019s out of whack.\n\nKelp has been struggling because of warmer-than-usual waters in the Pacific Ocean. And, in 2013, a mysterious disease began wiping out tens of millions of starfish, including a species called the sunflower sea star that is the only real predator of the ultra-hardy purple urchin. Around the same time, the purple urchins had two excellent breeding years \u2013 and with no predators, those gametes grew up and are now eating everything in sight.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine all of these small urchins growing up, each one of them looking for food, desperate for food. They\u2019re literally starving out there,\u201d said Steven Rumrill, lead shellfish expert at Oregon\u2019s wildlife agency. \u201cI\u2019ve seen some big-scale fluctuations in the populations of sea stars and urchins, but never on this magnitude.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A container at the lab holds hundreds of live purple urchins harvested from the Mendocino county coast.

And kelp, already under siege from warming waters, is not as resilient as it once was, said Norah Eddy, an associate director at the Nature Conservancy California\u2019s oceans program.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see climate change as a big driver of changes in kelp forest as we move forward, and we are already seeing that,\u201d said Eddy, who is leading an effort to use drones to map and monitor northern California\u2019s last remaining kelp forests.\n\nEconomic losses\n\nThe devastation is also economic: until now, red abalone and red sea urchins, a larger and meatier species of urchin, supported a thriving commercial fishery in both states. But 96% of red abalone have disappeared from California\u2019s northern coast as the number of purple sea urchins increased sixfold, according to a study released this week by the University of California, Davis.\n\nLast year, California closed its red abalone fishery, which poured an estimated $44m into the coastal economy per year, and Oregon suspended permits for its 300 abalone divers for three years. The commercial harvest of red sea urchins in California and Oregon also has taken an enormous hit.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a huge economic loss for our small coastal communities,\u201d said Cynthia Catton, a research associate with the UC Davis Bodega Marine Lab. \u201cIn California, there were 30,000 to 40,000 participants in [the abalone] fishery every year for decades, and for the first time ever that fishery had to close.\u201d\n\nAnd while the purple urchins have eaten themselves into starvation as well, unlike other kelp-dependent creatures, the species can go into a dormant state, stop reproducing and live for years with no food.\n\nThat means the only way to restore the kelp is to remove or destroy the purple urchins. Scientists estimate that in Oregon alone, it would take 15 to 20 years to remove all 100m lb (45m kg) of purple urchins recently surveyed on just one large reef.\n\nWhile urchins are in starvation mode, the edible part \u2013 known as roe \u2013 shrivels, making them commercially worthless.\n\nAn unusual solution\n\nAgainst this backdrop, conservationists, commercial urchin harvesters, scientists and private interests are coming together with an unusual plan: pay underemployed red sea urchin divers to collect the shriveled, but living, purple sea urchins and transfer them to carefully tended urchin \u201cranches\u201d to be fattened up for sale to seafood markets around the world.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An aerial view of one of the last remaining kelp forests near Elk, California, on the Mendocino county coast, which has lost more than 90% of its bull kelp in less than a decade.

Oregon\u2019s urchin fishery had a boom year last year, when red urchins were scarce in California but before their purple cousins had spread north. Now, they too are hurting.\n\nRumrill, the shellfish expert from Oregon, supports efforts to harvest excess urchins but strikes a less optimistic note when it comes to saving the kelp.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a promising technique. But we shouldn\u2019t fool ourselves into thinking that we\u2019re going to solve this large-scale ecological problem, this literal perfect storm of events, by eating our way out,\u201d he said.\n\n", "description": "Voracious purple urchins in waters of California and Oregon pose threat to mighty kelp forests and risk upending delicate ecosystems", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46c36675c12d4e81876a0665e8b8672c535eff72/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0e4eff1e31d0b8a21f1149d7dcf05339", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
