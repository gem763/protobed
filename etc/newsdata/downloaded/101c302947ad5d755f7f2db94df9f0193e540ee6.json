Viewers discovered that all four episodes for next week had surfaced online, featuring major storylines including the return of Martin Fowler (James Bye) and developments in the storyline of Adrian Edmondson\u2019s character Daniel Cook.\n\nLinks were shared on social media, leaving most fans annoyed to have had some content ruined \u2013 while others were exclaiming their surprise that such a leak would happen. However, after being alerted to the leak, the BBC were quick to take action and remove the episodes, meaning the spoilers are hopefully minimal for those not actively seeking them out.\n\nAs the episodes were not up for long, many fans won\u2019t have had the plot details ruined \u2013 and we aren\u2019t going to reveal anything beyond the usual embargoes here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA spokesperson for the soap told Metro.co.uk: \u2018As soon as we became aware of the unauthorised publication, we took immediate action to remove them. We are investigating to prevent this happening again.\u2019\n\nIt is unknown whether the leak was a deliberate breach or a mistake at this stage.\n\nViewers have been enjoying watching the drama in Walford unfold over recent weeks and major events such as the siege, Callum Highway (Tony Clay) publicly coming out and kissing Ben Mitchell (Max Bowden) and Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) being targeted by Leo King (Tom Wells) have played out without major spoilers.\n\nThe show is up for several awards at tomorrow night\u2019s Inside Soap Awards, with many proclaiming that the show is on top form right now as it moves into the crucial autumn and winter storylines.\n\nAnd major twists such as the exit of Mel Owen (Tamzin Outhwaite) and the reveal of Sharon Mitchell\u2019s (Letitia Dean) pregnancy by Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters) remain to be played out.\n\nFor top enjoyment of them, our only advice would be not to go looking for any leaks \u2013 there are some blockbuster storylines ahead that will be best enjoyed watched live with fellow fans.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The popular soap had several episodes leaked.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Martin-Fowler-returns-in-EastEnders-7be4_1570366787.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
