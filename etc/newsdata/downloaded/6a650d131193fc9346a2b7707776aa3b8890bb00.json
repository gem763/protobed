It\u2019s just September, and September is historically the worst month for stocks.\n\nAs Mark Hulbert of the Hulbert Financial Digest explains, at MarketWatch:\n\nNot only is its average return the worst of any since the Dow Jones Industrial Average was created in the late 1800s (minus 1.0%, versus an average gain of 0.8% for all other months), its poor performance has been quite consistent. In all decades but one over the last century, September\u2019s performance rank was in the bottom half of the distribution.\n\nThis September might be particularly volatile, thanks to economic anxieties about tariffs and interest rates and yield curves, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should start panicking. In fact, Hulbert advises stockholders to... well, continue holding:\n\nHere\u2019s my strategy for exploiting September\u2019s record as the worst month of the calendar for the stock market: Make no changes to your portfolio.\n\nHowever, if you want to add \u201cbuy\u201d to the standard \u201cbuy and hold\u201d advice, remember that any temporary market downswing also means that stocks are on sale.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re following our suggestion to check your investment portfolio only once a month, you might want to hold off this month\u2019s check until, like, September 30.", "description": "If your investments don\u2019t do as well this month as they have in previous months, don\u2019t worry.
