And two blowout wins into the season, the Michigan native is firmly established as first-year coach Mike Locksley\u2019s starter and is creating a buzz with a Terrapins team ranked for the first time since 2013.\n\n\u201cI was looking for a place I could continue my academic career and hopefully continue my athletic career, and be in a situation where I could possibly get to the NFL,\u201d Jackson told The Washington Times this week.\n\nHe\u2019s found that under Locksley and offensive coordinator Scottie Montgomery. Jackson has completed 36 of 62 passes for 541 yards and seven touchdowns with just one interception in the season\u2019s first eight quarters.\n\nAfter starting all 13 games for the Hokies in 2017, Jackson was lost for the season in September of last year with a broken leg. It was a disappointing end to his time in Blacksburg, he said. But while he was there, Jackson said he learned how to shoulder the pressures of being a team leader.\n\n\u201cI am definitely more mature than when I was at 17, going into Virginia Tech,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nThat maturity has been key to his adjustment to the Terrapins.\n\n\u201cAs time has gone on, I have been more vocal,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a bigger role on the team. I want to continue to be the best I can.\u201d\n\nHe is running an offense that doesn\u2019t hesitate to use its tight ends \u2014 a big part of the plan for Montgomery, who was let go at East Carolina as head coach after last season.\n\nMontgomery played in the NFL from 2000 to 2003 as a wideout with Oakland and Denver and coached with the Pittsburgh Steelers from 2010-12. But it is Montgomery\u2019s Duke degree that prompts ribbing from Locksley.\n\n\u201cSmartest guy in the room,\u201d Locksley said of Montgomery.\n\nIn Montgomery\u2019s offense, the Terrapins have had 11 different players haul in at least one catch in the first two games.\n\nThat includes four from running backs Jake Funk and three from running back Anthony McFarland. Funk has run for a team-high 173 yards in two games, while McFarland has 130 yards on the ground on just 10 carries.\n\nTight end Tyler Mabry is another graduate transfer and also from Michigan. The former University of Buffalo player became the first Maryland tight end in 11 years to have touchdowns in back-to-back games.\n\nJackson said one of the biggest challenges was getting the Terrapins\u2019 playbook under his belt.\n\n\u201cI had to work at it all summer and during camp and even now,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI just have to continue to study and focus.\u201d\n\nJackson gives a lot of credit to his offensive line, including senior Ellis McKennie. \u201cHe can play anywhere,\u201d Jackson said of McKennie.\n\nJackson wasn\u2019t a typical transfer to Maryland. He grew up in Ann Arbor, where his father was a coach at the University of Michigan. The younger Jackson earned an undergraduate degree in psychology and is pursuing a master\u2019s in professional studies in technology entrepreneurship.\n\nJackson is not worried about the Terrapins being overconfident going into Saturday\u2019s contest in Philadelphia against the unranked Temple Owls.\n\n\u201cI think Coach Locksley does a good job with that,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cAt the end of the day, good or bad, you can\u2019t let the ranking affect you.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
