REUTERS/David Gray\n\nThe U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) earlier announced that an independent three-member panel of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) determined the suspension after Dwyer was found to have had testosterone pellets inserted in his body.\n\nDwyer, 30, tested positive for an anabolic agent in three out-of-competition urine samples last November and December, USADA said in a news release.\n\n\u201cFollowing a full evidentiary hearing, the panel found that Dwyer had testosterone pellets inserted in his body in violation of the rules,\u201d USADA said.\n\nDwyer said he was following a doctor-prescribed medical treatment that he did not realise contained the banned substance testosterone and noted that the panel said in its report that he was not significantly at fault for the violation.\n\n\u201cMy doctor assured me that the United States Olympic Committee had approved the treatment before I agreed to it,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAbsent of these assurances, I never would have agreed to this medically necessary treatment.\n\n\u201cRegardless of the result of the arbitration ruling, I have decided to retire from swimming to pursue other professional interests.\n\n\u201cIt was an honor to represent my country alongside my team mates and with the support of my coaches, family, and friends.\u201d\n\nDwyer was part of the U.S. 4x200m freestyle teams that won gold at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics. He also claimed bronze in the individual 200 freestyle at Rio in 2016.\n\nUSADA CEO Travis Tygart said: \u201cAs noted in the panel\u2019s decision, USADA is independent of sport and here to help athletes ensure they compete clean and protect their health and well-being within the rules.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that Mr Dwyer did not take advantage of this support and hopefully this case will convince others to do so in order to protect fair and healthy competition for all athletes.\u201d\n\nDwyer\u2019s 20-month ban began on Dec. 21 last year, the date of his provisional suspension.", "description": "American double Olympic champion Conor Dwyer on Friday said he was retiring from swimming on the day he was handed a 20-month doping ban that ruled him out of next year's Tokyo Olympics.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439863047&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A27X", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
