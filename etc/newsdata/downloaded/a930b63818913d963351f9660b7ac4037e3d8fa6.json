And that something was Sarah Paulson.\n\nBut it looks like the actress might\u2019ve just teased us with the possibility of a sneaky appearance in the new season.\n\n\u201cI may pop up,\u201d Paulson said in an interview with Entertainment Tonight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bittersweet because I have a lot of friends who are still on the show. So I\u2019m getting updates about how it\u2019s all going and what they\u2019re doing, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Wait, what? You worked until two? Oh, I remember working until two on that show.'\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t know much about 1984, but with Ryan Murphy and the team behind the previous AHS seasons, it\u2019s obvious that it\u2019ll be incredible.\n\nThe ninth season follows the story of a group of young adults working at a summer camp when they\u2019re tormented by a hospital patient by the name of Mr. Jingles. The name \u201cMr. Jingles\u201d is enough to make me crap my pants.\n\nCamp Redwood, where the show takes place, is \u201cthe site of the worst summer massacre of all time,\u201d so it\u2019s about to get spooky AF.\n\nThe cast includes Emma Roberts, Billie Lourd and Glee star Matthew Morrison, but until now we were told that AHS queen Sarah Paulson was a no-show.\n\nBut in her recent interview with ET she dropped a sneaky hint that makes us all pray she\u2019ll make an appearance in season 9.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited for this season. I think it\u2019s a really cool idea for the show this year,\u201d Paulson said, \u201cAnd you never know, I may pop up. You never know. No promises though.\u201d\n\nI know she said no promises, but if she doesn\u2019t make an appearance I will be writing a very stern letter to Ryan Murphy for breaking my heart like this.", "description": "", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/46957.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
