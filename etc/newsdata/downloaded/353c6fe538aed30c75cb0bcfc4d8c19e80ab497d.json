Gabriella Bondi, who was suffering from severe dry skin last August, didn\u2019t improve when her doctor allegedly prescribed Benadryl.\n\n\u201cBut by late that evening, her face had gotten worse and suddenly \u2013 in a matter of mere hours, her whole body was covered in a red rash that was red and painful.\u201d Christine Bondi-Cerrato, Gabriella\u2019s mother, told Caters News, according to Mirror.co.uk.\n\nSTRETCH MARK REMOVAL PROCEDURE LEAVES MOM WITH INFECTED SCARS\n\nBondi-Cerrato took her daughter to the hospital, where she started losing her hair and the rash continued to spread. There, she was allegedly diagnosed with Scarlet Fever and sent home with more medication, but within 24 hours they returned and due to her deteriorating condition she was transferred to a children\u2019s hospital.\n\nBondi-Cerrato told Caters News, according to Mirror.co.uk, her daughter was started on IV antibiotics while doctors explored the possibility of Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSSS), Stevens Johnson Syndrome, or Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis.\n\nBondi-Cerrato said the misdiagnoses and not knowing what was ailing her daughter was the hardest part of the ordeal.\n\n\u201cWe eventually found out that Gabby\u2019s Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) was caused by her Impetigo infection, which was so incredibly mild and we never even would have thought for a second it could turn into something so life-threatening or devastating,\u201d she reportedly told the news outlet.\n\nGIRL, 14, DIES OF RARE FUNGAL INFECTION CAUSED BY MOLD; MOM SAYS DAUGHTER 'CHOKED ON HER OWN BLOOD'\n\nTSS is a rare, life-threatening complication of bacterial infections. It can be caused by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, or by group A streptococcus bacteria, but while it is also associated with the use of superabsorbent tampons, it can occur in anyone, including children.\n\nPossible signs or symptoms include sudden high fever, low blood pressure, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, confusion, muscle aches, redness of the eyes, mouth and throat, seizures, and headaches, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPeople who have been diagnosed with TSS are at risk of recurrence, which is something Bondi-Cerrato fears for her daughter. She was placed on oral antibiotics, but continues to deal with immunity issues nearly a year later, according to Mirror.co.uk. Still, her family is grateful to have acted as quickly as they did.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cIf we had waited much longer, the results could have been catastrophic,\u201d Bondi-Cerrato told Caters News, according to Mirror.co.uk.", "description": "Bondi-Cerrato said the misdiagnoses and not knowing what was ailing her daughter was the hardest part of the ordeal.", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Gabriella-Bondi-3-Carters.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
