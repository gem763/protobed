The S&P 500 declined less than 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1%.\n\nData early Monday showed Germany's manufacturing and services sector weakened more than expected in September, adding to investors' worries about the health of Europe's biggest economy.\n\nThat sent European markets lower, with the Stoxx Europe 600 retreating 0.9% and German government bond yields slipping further below zero.\n\nEven with Monday's declines, though, U.S. stock indexes remain less than 1% from records. Investors have attributed strong gains there to the relative strength of the U.S. economy.\n\n\"It looks like we're in a slowdown, but that slowdown won't become a recession yet,\" said Sandip Bhagat, chief investment officer of Whittier Trust, adding he took reassurance from strong labor market data, a robust service sector and still benign inflationary pressures.\n\nChanges in analyst ratings drove swings among individual stocks Monday, with United States Steel losing 1% and AK Steel Holding falling 0.9% after JPMorgan Chase lowered its rating on the two stocks, citing weak steel prices.\n\nRoku jumped 2.7%, paring losses after worries about competition in the streaming-media devices industry sent the stock tumbling the prior week.\n\nIn Europe, airplane and travel companies were one bright spot in the region, rising after rival British travel group Thomas Cook Group failed to conclude a rescue deal with investors and creditors, canceling all bookings and forcing U.K. authorities to help get thousands of vacationers home.\n\nShares of travel company TUI rose 7%, while EasyJet gained 3.5%.\n\nElsewhere, Chinese shares fell after a canceled trip by Chinese negotiators to farms in Montana raised doubts about progress on U.S.-China trade talks. President Trump also late last week rejected suggestions the U.S. would accept a partial trade agreement with China, saying his administration is \"looking for a complete deal.\"\n\n\"I think this is the case of, well, we had the promise of more talks but where do we go from here?\" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading firm IG Group.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite Index closed nearly 1% lower, while its smaller Shenzhen counterpart fell slightly more than 1%.\n\n\"The farm visit news was certainly a factor but having said that, investors' expectations for a quick resolution had been pretty low in the first place,\" said Zhang Gang, senior analyst at Central China Securities, saying the declines were relatively limited by Chinese standards.\n\nTwists and turns on the trade front aside, the Chinese central bank's decision to hold a key medium-term interest rate steady last week has continued to weigh on sentiment, Mr. Zhang said. \"There are few signs that the authorities will significantly loosen monetary policy in the near term,\" he added.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.8% after another weekend of protests. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average was closed for a holiday, and South Korea's Kospi was flat.\n\nShen Hong and Joseph Wallace contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com and Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 23, 2019 10:10 ET (14:10 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
