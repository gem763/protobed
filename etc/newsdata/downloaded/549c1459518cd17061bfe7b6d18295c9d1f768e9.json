Police also seized 40 jaw bones, as well as 30 leg and arm bones, and a fetus in a glass jar.\n\nPhotographs distributed by the authorities showed the altar also featured a cross, wooden masks, knives, and a large picture of what appears to be a horned goat in front of a pyramid.\n\nMexico: 27 drugs suspects released a week after El Chapo's son freed after gun battle Read more\n\nThe find is not necessarily an indication of murder in a country where popular culture provides for a vast range of different relationships with the dead.\n\nAll over the country people flock to cemeteries during Day of the Dead celebrations around 1 November to decorate, and often party, over the graves of their loved ones.\n\nIn the indigenous Mayan community of Pomuch, in the southern state of Campeche, the tradition includes families digging up the bones of their relatives and giving them a clean.\n\nThe fascination generated by the drug den altar in Tepito may also offer a diversion from the controversy surrounding the massive pre-dawn raid in which it was discovered. Hundreds of police and marines participated in the operation which uncovered two suspected methamphetamine labs, as well as 2.5 tons of marijuana, 20 guns, five grenades, and a rocket launcher.\n\nBut hopes that the raid represented a major blow to a local trafficking gang known as La Uni\u00f3n crumbled when a judge released 27 of the 31 people arrested. He argued that the case against them was full of irregularities, including video evidence that many of those detained were actually at a party at an entirely different location from where police said they had been arrested.\n\nMexican authorities are under intense pressure to prove that they can combat organized crime after a string of high-profile security disasters, including the murder of 13 police officers in an ambush, and the brief capture and release of a son of Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n.", "description": "Test results of the remains \u2013 police also found 40 jaw bones and 30 leg and arm bones \u2013 will be checked against missing person lists", "authors": ["Jo Tuckman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29b4886825d27f64c123fef17d0862c17ee44f6c/0_201_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=409f6ab17258650c3042ae37983317d3", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
