But if you look at this administration, the network that has benefitted the most has been MSNBC.\u201d\n\nThe Fox executive\u2019s comments follow Fox News anchor Shepard Smith\u2019s sudden exit from the network after working there since its 1996 inception. Mr. Smith was a frequent critic of President Trump\u2019s policies and publicly criticized his primetime colleague Sean Hannity and the network\u2019s opinion commentary.\n\nMr. Murdoch didn\u2019t talk about Mr. Shepard\u2019s departure but was asked by The Hollywood Reporter whether the late Roger Ailes would tolerate so much infighting at the network.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t speak to if Roger were around or not, but unfortunately in this country there\u2019s less and less civil debate,\u201d Mr. Murdoch said. \u201cCivil debate among our countrymen and our colleagues at work is something we always aspire to.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
