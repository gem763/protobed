And the company said the openings are not related to the usual increase in hiring it does to prepare for the busy holiday shopping season.\n\nThe job fairs will take place Sept. 17 in six U.S. cities where it thinks it can find the strongest talent: Arlington, Virginia; Boston; Chicago; Dallas; Nashville, Tennessee; and its hometown of Seattle. The company is calling it \u201cAmazon Career Day,\u201d and set up a website with more details: www.amazon.jobs/careerday .\n\n\u201cI encourage anyone willing to think big and move fast to apply for a job with us,\u201d said Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos, in a statement to The Associated Press. \u201cYou\u2019ll get to invent and see Amazon making even bolder bets on behalf of our customers.\u201d\n\nThe job fairs are a sign of the tight job market. With unemployment near a 50-year low, employers have to work harder to fill empty positions. Recently, Amazon said it would turn to its own employees to find more tech-savvy workers, offering to retrain 100,000 employees, or a third of its U.S. workforce, and help them switch to more technical jobs, like software engineering.\n\nThe high number of job openings, which Amazon said is the most it\u2019s had at one time, shows how fast the company is growing. Started as an online bookstore more than two decades ago, Amazon now produces movies, makes voice-activated gadgets and has plans to send satellites into space to provide internet service.\n\nIt\u2019s also building a second headquarters in Arlington, which it expects to employ 40,000 people in the next several years. Amazon already has more than 650,000 employees worldwide, making it the second-biggest private employer in the U.S., after Walmart Inc.\n\nThe company hopes the hiring events will create some buzz and bring in candidates with the skills it needs. Thousands of people showed up for nationwide job fairs it held two years ago for warehouse workers.\n\nAt the hiring events next week, Amazon said about 1,000 recruiters will help candidates apply for the jobs, prepare them for job interviews and give them more information on the roles.\n\n_____\n\nFollow Joseph Pisani on Twitter at http://twitter.com/josephpisani\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Amazon is going on a hiring spree.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joseph Pisani"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/amazon-hiring_81691_c0-151-3600-2249_s1770x1032.jpg?86a0ad2941f4f8cac64fde118e16286d6ebd0c8d", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
