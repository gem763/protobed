As one of his very few black fans, I described how, after years of giving him the benefit of the doubt, buying every record he ever made, and leaping on stage to kiss him at shows, I felt personally betrayed by his repeated demonstrations of intolerance.\n\nFast-forward a few months, and on Sunday I woke to friends sending me pictures of Morrissey wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the words \u201cFuck the Guardian\u201d. One message was accompanied by expletives, another by the eye-roll emoji. Another simply said, \u201cYou did this.\u201d\n\nGQ said if Morrissey agreed to a full interview, it would publish it. It seemed the perfect fit\n\nNow, I can\u2019t take sole credit for Morrissey\u2019s hostility towards this newspaper. Many colleagues have spoken out about his outbursts. But given that I was publicly invited by Morrissey\u2019s manager to the Hollywood Bowl concert where he donned the sweary garment, and then refused an interview when I tried to take him up on the offer, the T-shirt does feel like it was aimed at me.\n\nThe invitation was set in motion the day after my article was published in June, when his manager, Peter Katsis, posted on Morrissey\u2019s official Facebook page asking me to join his autumn tour of America, all expenses paid, to see for myself that (in block capitals) \u201cMORRISSEY IS NOT RACIST.\u201d\n\nWas this a genuine offer? Many of Morrissey\u2019s 1.3 million Facebook followers thought so and encouraged me to take the gig. What an opportunity to finally get answers to all the questions I\u2019d had since my teens. I was genuinely excited.\n\nI emailed Katsis at his offices in Beverly Hills, accepting the invitation and his one proviso \u2013 to \u201cfind a better paper than the Guardian to sell it to, since they have the absolute lowest circulation of all the major dailies in the UK\u201d.\n\nI explained that the Guardian had shaped my identity from an early age as much as Morrissey had, because it stood up for marginalised people \u2013 as he once did \u2013 sought to uncover truths and spoke its mind.\n\nTo get across how much this invite meant to me, I told Morrissey\u2019s team that I was prepared to break my boycott of Trump\u2019s America, which I haven\u2019t visited since 2015. Katsis and I talked on the phone, and he seemed pleasant enough, even if I had to bite my tongue at some of his more cringeworthy defences of Morrissey: that he had people of colour over to his house for dinner all the time, that he\u2019d never heard him say anything racist; that he was simply a provocateur who had never voted for a political party in his life.\n\nLater, he sent me a picture of the soul singer Thelma Houston with Morrissey in a studio where they\u2019d just cut a track, as if to say, \u201cLook, look! She\u2019s black!\u201d As I say, he was nice enough, but also a bit like an out-of-touch uncle who didn\u2019t really get it and thought I could be swayed into writing a sympathetic piece on his wayward star. Regardless, I spent the whole summer pitching the story to editors of various publications. Every approach was met with a similar response. They were all intrigued by the idea \u2013 a tour diary, on the road with Morrissey through Trump\u2019s America \u2013 but despite giving it some thought, said it wasn\u2019t right for their periodical. You see, Moz, your T-shirt should really say \u201cFuck all press\u201d \u2013 as, sadly, that\u2019s what you will end up with.\n\nMorrissey performs in LA wearing explicit anti-Guardian vest Read more\n\nThen, finally, a breakthrough came. GQ, the well-respected, glossy men\u2019s mag, said that if Morrissey agreed to a full interview, it would publish it. It seemed the perfect fit. Everything was in place. I got my US work visa, agreed to Morrissey\u2019s amended timetable \u2013 not the first week of the tour as first promised, but the final date at the Hollywood Bowl.\n\nAnd then? Morrissey refused to grant an interview.\n\nThe reasons given were that he didn\u2019t trust journalists, used his own website to put out communiques, and hadn\u2019t done an interview since one with Der Spiegel two years ago, which ended badly.\n\nI\u2019m left feeling that the invitation was intended to garner good publicity, and that there was never any intention of confronting my questions head on. I was supposed to meet Morrissey to see for myself that he\u2019s not racist. Sadly, he declined the opportunity to prove it.\n\n\u2022 Joshua Surtees is a columnist, feature writer and reporter based in London and Trinidad", "description": "I was invited by the singer\u2019s manager to the concert where he donned the notorious T-shirt, says feature writer Joshua Surtees", "authors": ["Joshua Surtees"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8926092fa45332f45f7157027c93a355e8060ff/114_0_2218_1331/master/2218.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=06d923e65d4fc38d2bd3e4eb92b9544c", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
