There were women in cowboy boots and men in bolo ties. As if there was any doubt, posters papered the walls: \u201cWe\u2019re Texas Democrats, y\u2019all.\u201d\n\nThe Lone Star State has long eluded Democrats. But significant gains in the 2018 midterms and a series of Republican congressional retirements \u2013 a phenomenon Democrats have gleefully branded a \u201cTexodus\u201d \u2013 have raised hopes that 2020 will be a year of sweeping political change.\n\n\u201cIn my 35 years or 40 years of working for the Democratic party, this has never happened in the state of Texas,\u201d Gilberto Hinojosa, chair of the state party, boomed over the music. \u201cTexas is now the biggest battleground state in the country.\u201d\n\nBeto O\u2019 Rourke lost by 200,000 votes. There were 3.5 million voters last year, Latinos, who did not vote Tom Perez\n\nIt was John Steinbeck who said: \u201cTexas is a state of mind. Texas is an obsession. Above all, Texas is a nation in every sense of the word.\u201d More recently, New Yorker writer and Austin resident Lawrence Wright, author of God Save Texas: A Journey into the Soul of the Lone Star State, wrote: \u201cTexans see themselves as a distillation of the best qualities of America: friendly, confident, hardworking, patriotic, neurosis-free.\u201d\n\nThough Texas as a Republican stronghold is fixed in the popular imagination, significant demographic and cultural shifts \u2013 a growing Hispanic population and an influx of newcomers to the cities \u2013 are loosening the GOP\u2019s grip. Given the importance of the state in the election of president, accounting for 38 electoral votes and 7% of the electoral college in 2016, this has huge national significance.\n\nSuddenly, everyone from House speaker Nancy Pelosi to Republican senator Ted Cruz believes Texas is up for grabs. It was O\u2019Rourke\u2019s spirited Senate run last year, against Cruz, that led many here to believe that the political sands may be shifting.\n\n\u201cTexas is going to be hotly contested in 2020,\u201d Cruz said at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast last week. He was confident that Trump would win, but said the result \u201cwill be closer than last time\u201d.\n\nTom Perez, the Democratic National Committee chair, said his organization chose Houston for the third debate because the state is \u201cin play up and down the ballot\u201d. He said there are millions of Latinos eligible to vote in Texas but who sat out in 2018 and could make a difference in 2020.\n\n\u201cBeto O\u2019 Rourke lost by 200,000 votes,\u201d he said at a \u201cCafecito con Politics\u201d event in Houston on Friday. \u201cThere were 3.5 million voters last year \u2013 Latinos \u2013 who did not vote and could have voted.\u201d\n\nTexas has voted Republican in every presidential election since 1976. Donald Trump continued the streak in 2016, but by a far slimmer margin than past nominees.\n\nDemocrats believe Trump\u2019s unpopularity with suburban women and Hispanic voters could accelerate the political upheaval.\n\n\u20181,000 new Texans a day\u2019\n\nTexas is often portrayed in popular culture as emblematic of the frontier spirt, populated by God-fearing, gun-loving, rock-ribbed conservatives. The reality is more nuanced.\n\nAs Wright pointed out, \u201cTexans are hardly monolithic. The state is as politically divided as the rest of the nation. One can drive across it and be in two different states at the same time: FM Texas and AM Texas. FM Texas is the silky voice of city dwellers, the kingdom of National Public Radio. It is progressive, reasonable, secular \u2013 almost like California. AM Texas speaks to the suburbs and the rural areas: Trumpland.\u201d\n\nSince 2010, 3.5 million new residents have moved to the state. Jobs and affordable housing continue to lure young, college-educated workers to Houston, Dallas, Austin and San Antonio, said Lila Valencia, a senior demographer at the Texas Demographic Center.", "description": "The state has long eluded Democrats, but significant gains in the 2018 midterms and a series of GOP congressional retirements have raised hopes for changeSupporters of Juli\u00e1n Castro gather near the site of the Democratic presidential primary debates on 12 September 2019 in Houston, Texas.
