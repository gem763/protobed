(Image: Marvel Studios/Weta Digital)\n\nThe cathartic release of Endgame\u2019s cataclysmic final battle between the gathered heroes of a decade\u2019s worth of Marvel blockbusters and the forces of Thanos is a moment of abject, indulgent spectacle in a movie crammed full of them. So it\u2019s befitting that its own VFX reel is equally indulgent.\n\nWeta Digital have just released this new VFX reel of its work on Avengers: Endgame, primarily focusing on the film\u2019s third act \u2014 which, understandably, required a considerable amount of effects work.\n\nHow else you gonna have Tessa Thompson fly in on a winged horse while a Paul Rudd the size of of a skyscraper punches a giant armoured space lizard in the face?\n\nIt, perhaps almost like Endgame itself at times, is a little too flashy for its own good.\n\nIt cleverly interweaves the final FX shots from the film with behind-the-scenes greenscreen material from filming to blend together what was real and what wasn\u2019t, but to a point that it almost obfuscates it.\n\nI want to see more of the actual behind-the-scenes stuff, not just watch the last battle again! I\u2019ve got a Blu-ray for that.\n\nBut there\u2019s still some fun little moments in here to glimpse, like the choreography of Captain Marvel going toe-to-toe with Thanos (or rather Josh Brolin in a hilariously torso\u2019d mocap rig), or the fact that actually, all Chris Evans was actually spinning around when Cap revealed his worthiness to wield Mjolnir was the hammer\u2019s shaft:\n\nNext you\u2019ll tell me the giant purple supervillain was a computer effect, too! (Image: Marvel Studios/Weta Digital)\n\nDoes that still count as worthy? I\u2019m sure someone will find a way to endlessly debate over it, either way.", "description": "The cathartic release of Endgame\u2019s cataclysmic final battle between the gathered heroes of a decade\u2019s worth of Marvel blockbusters and the forces of Thanos is a moment of abject, indulgent spectacle in a movie crammed full of them.
