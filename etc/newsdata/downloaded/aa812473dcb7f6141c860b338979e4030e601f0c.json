Differing estimates place the number of failed Alzheimer\u2019s drugs somewhere between 150 and 300.\n\nWhat they\u2019re saying: \u201cI admit to you, we are getting pretty desperate,\u201d Samuel Gandy, associate director of the Mount Sinai Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center, told Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cThis is really the final data point that shows we do not really know what is causing this disease and how to make an impact with a pharmaceutical,\u201d biotech investor Brad Loncar said in the Financial Times.\n\nBetween the lines: Most Alzheimer\u2019s research to date has focused on a protein called beta amyloid, which forms large plaques on Alzheimer\u2019s patients\u2019 brains. Broadly speaking, the theory was that those plaques cause Alzheimer\u2019s, and that an effective treatment would break them up.\n\nBut with each new failure, more and more scientists second-guessing that theory. The Biogen failure seems like a tipping point.\n\n\u201cSomething is wrong with the way we\u2019re thinking about Alzheimer\u2019s and amyloid,\u201d wrote Derek Lowe, a longtime amyloid skeptic who blogs for Science magazine. \u201cIt\u2019s been wrong for a long time and that\u2019s been clear for a long time. Do something else.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next: Research into other theories is happening, but most of it still in the earliest stages. And there is no broad agreement about where to go next \u2014 no consensus about what will work, only a growing consensus about what won't.\n\nSome biotech companies are targeting brain inflammation; others, genetic mutations tied to the brain\u2019s immune system, according to a Wall Street Journal roundup. Another theory is focused on a possible role for infectious agents. A different brain protein, called tau, has also gotten a lot of attention.\n\nThe bottom line: The National Institutes of Health will spend $2.3 billion on Alzheimer's research this year, according to the Alzheimer's Association, and biotech companies are spending billions more.", "description": "Scientists think they may have been on the wrong track.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/eelXNVcuqBrGpL8_A8oUHnd4vjM=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/03/24/1553449192855.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-25"}
