How they act is more than we deserve and I apologise for this no performance today.\n\n\"I haven't seen the red card. The first goal started with a pass back, but I don\u2019t know if it was a red.\"\n\nSouthampton now face two away games against Manchester City , with their Carabao Cup clash taking place on Tuesday followed by a Premier League meeting between the sides a week on Saturday.", "description": "Saints boss took full responsibility for biggest home defeat in top-flight history and apologised to fans", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Pa", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20727712.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Southampton-v-Leicester-City-Premier-League-St-Marys-Stadium.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
