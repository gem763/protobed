Chief among those is centre Jonathan Davies, who was withdrawn from Sunday\u2019s team at the last minute.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a grade two (hamstring tear) and will be ruled out,\u201d Gatland said of Navidi. \u201cWe have a process that we need to go through with World Rugby.\n\n\u201cGiven we brought six backrowers and have five fit at the moment and have been a little bit short in numbers in the backs, then it will probably be a back who comes out as a replacement.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is disappointing for him because he has been so influential for us over the past 12 months.\u201d\n\nGatland added that Navidi has been an influential player over the past 12 months but expects both Davies and fellow midfield back Hadleigh Parkes, who played on Sunday with a broken hand, to be available for the semi-final.\n\n\u201cHe (Davies) was touch and go for the weekend. The difficult decision with Jonathan was going into the game with two midfielders who weren\u2019t 100%,\u201d Gatland said.\n\n\u201cHadleigh still has a broken bone in his hand and was also carrying a shoulder contusion, so to have one centre who was fit was pretty important for us.\u201d\n\nGatland also admitted that his side had used up their \u201cget out of jail free card\u201d in their 20-19 victory over a French team reduced to 14 men by Sebastien Vahaamahina\u2019s red card and will need to raise their game against the Springboks in Yokohama.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty familiar with the way they play. I think they were trying to be a bit too expansive in the way they played a few years ago,\u201d the New Zealander said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve gone back to their strengths - and their strengths are definitely that physicality up front, with driving lineouts and a strong scrum and ball-carrying.\u201d\n\nThe list of South Africa\u2019s attributes didn\u2019t stop there.\n\n\u201cAnd a good kicking game as well. So you\u2019ve got to be able to handle (all) those threats. They\u2019ve got a couple of pretty exciting wingers, too,\u201d he said.\n\nYet Gatland, who is stepping down after the tournament to take charge at his hometown club Waikato Chiefs, remains confident that Wales have their best chance to win a first World Cup if they get past South Africa.\n\n\u201cYou get these opportunities once in a lifetime and you\u2019ve got to grab them with both hands,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about having no regrets. That\u2019s the message of this week.\u201d\n\n(The story refiles to add dropped word in sixth paragraph)", "description": "Wales backrower Josh Navidi has been ruled out of the remainder of the Rugby World Cup after tearing his hamstring during the first half of Sunday's quarter-final victory over France, coach Warren Gatland said on Monday.", "authors": ["Greg Stutchbury", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443310053&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0O0", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
