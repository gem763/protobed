Most of these debates, alas, don\u2019t veer too far from the policy-oriented realms of economics or law. Now that the Big Technocracy wants to quash Big Tech, expect more such wonkery.\n\nWhat, however, about the ideas that feed the Big Tech? For one, we are no longer in 2009: Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s sophomoric musings on transparency or the global village impress very few.\n\nAnd yet, for all the growing skepticism about Silicon Valley, many still believe that the digital revolution has a serious intellectual dimension, hashed out at conferences like Ted, online salons like Edge.org, publications like Wired, and institutions like the MIT Media Lab. The ideas of the digerati might be wrong, they might be overly utopian, but, at least, they are sincere.\n\nThe Epstein scandal \u2013 including the latest revelation that Epstein might have channeled up to $8m dollars (some of it, apparently, on behalf of Bill Gates) to the MIT Media Lab, while its executives were fully aware of his problematic background \u2013 has cast the digerati in a very different light. It has already led to the resignation of the lab\u2019s director, Joi Ito.\n\nPrivate jets, parties and eugenics: Jeffrey Epstein's bizarre world of scientists Read more\n\nThis, however, is not only a story of individuals gone rogue. The ugly collective picture of the techno-elites that emerges from the Epstein scandal reveals them as a bunch of morally bankrupt opportunists. To treat their ideas as genuine but wrong is too generous; the only genuine thing about them is their fakeness. The Big Tech and its apologists do produce the Big Thoughts \u2013 alas, mostly accidental byproducts of them chasing the Big Bucks.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t meant to be that way. Back in 1991, John Brockman \u2013 the world\u2019s most successful digital impresario, and, until recently, my literary agent \u2013 was touting the emergence of the \u201cthird culture\u201d that would finally replace the technophobic literary intellectuals with those coming from the world of science and technology. \u201cThe emergence of the third culture introduces new modes of intellectual discourse and reaffirms the pre-eminence of America in the realm of important ideas,\u201d wrote Brockman in a much-discussed essay.\n\nBrockman, who would later connect Epstein to dozens of world-famous scientists, most of them his clients, made it seem as if it were people like him who built this \u201cthird culture\u201d \u2013 out of their perceptive genius. The cardinal error of such analysis, however, lies in its tendency to mistake structural transformations of global capitalism for zeitgeisty trends in the history of ideas.\n\nThus, Brockman\u2019s \u201cnew modes of intellectual discourse\u201d were mostly the result of technology companies moving away from large and soulless cold war military contracts and on to the world of funky personal computing. Apple, with Steve Jobs as its chief countercultural evangelist, needed the consumerist mysticism of \u201cthe third culture\u201d; IBM and Hewlett-Packard, stuck in the 1950s mentality, did not. Likewise, the \u201cpre-eminence of America in the realm of important ideas\u201d was, above all, the outcome of its dominance in the economic and military realms, weakening the efforts of other countries to create their own vibrant alternatives to Hollywood or Silicon Valley.\n\nThere was no better original exponent of the \u201cthird culture\u201d than Nicholas Negroponte, the founder of the MIT Media Lab and a new kind of applied intellectual, full of big ideas on technical subjects. The lab was ahead of its time in understanding that the industry and the government alike needed cooler, more interactive technology that was not provided by the traditional cold war contractors.\n\nEverything else followed suit. Thus, Negroponte became a speaker at the very first Technology, Entertainment, Design conference (the famous Ted Talks) in 1984, which, a few decades later, emerged as the pre-eminent promoter of the \u201cthird culture\u201d: no politics, no conflict, no ideology \u2013 just science, technology, and pragmatic problem-solving. Ideas as a service, neatly packaged in 18-minute intellectual snacks.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Joi Ito in 2009: \u2018Ito was to the \u201cthird culture\u201d of the 2000s what Negroponte was to its 1980s version.\u2019 Photograph: Alicia Canter/Alicia Canter (commissioned)\n\n\u201cThird culture\u201d was a perfect shield for pursuing entrepreneurial activities under the banner of intellectualism. Infinite networking with billionaires but also models and Hollywood stars; instant funding by philanthropists and venture capitalists moving in the same circles; bestselling books tied to skyrocketing speaking fees used as promotional materials for the author\u2019s more substantial commercial activities, often run out of academia.\n\nThat someone like Jeffrey Epstein would take advantage of these networks to whitewash his crimes was almost inevitable. In a world where books function as brand extensions and are never actually read, it\u2019s quite easy for a rich and glamorous charlatan of Epstein\u2019s stature to fit in.\n\nOne of Brockman\u2019s persistent laments was that all the billionaire techies in his circle barely read any of the books published by his clients. Not surprisingly, his famed literary dinners \u2013 held during the Ted Conference, they allowed Epstein (who kept Brockman\u2019s Edge Foundation on a retainer) to mingle with scientists and fellow billionaires \u2013 were mostly empty of serious content.\n\nAs Brockman himself put it after one such dinner in 2004, \u201clast year we tried \u2018The Science Dinner\u2019. Everyone yawned. So this year, it\u2019s back to the money-sex-power thing with \u2018The Billionaires\u2019 Dinner\u2019.\u201d Was \u201cthe money-sex-power thing\u201d that very potent \u201cnew mode of intellectual discourse\u201d promised by the \u201cthird culture\u201d? If so, we\u2019d rather pass.\n\nIn attendance at one such dinner, in 1999, was a young Japanese American by the name of Joi Ito; also present were Richard Saul Wurman, the original founder of the Ted Conference, Jeff Bezos, and, among all the other billionaires, Jeffrey Epstein. A godson of Timothy Leary and a college drop-out, Ito would eventually lead the Media Lab, interview Obama, write a popular technology book (another Brockman client), and join 20 different boards, including those of such prestigious institutions as the New York Times, the MacArthur Foundation, and the Knight Foundation.\n\nIto was to the \u201cthird culture\u201d of the 2000s what Negroponte was to its 1980s version. Whereas Negroponte has always projected an aura of aristocracy and privilege \u2013 coming from a very wealthy Greek family, he has recently prided himself on being on first-name terms with 80% of billionaires \u2013 Ito is your typical start-up disruptor, a disgruntled ex-manager of a night club in Japan, who, somehow, reinvented himself as a \u201cthird culture\u201d intellectual.\n\nCan we still trust what the intellectuals of the 'third culture' actually have to say, given what they have to sell?\n\nHowever, much like at Brockman\u2019s billionaire dinners, there\u2019s not much content to be found in Ito\u2019s work: for the most part, it\u2019s just techno-blabbery mixed with a heavy dose of futuristic jargon. But it doesn\u2019t matter. Under the \u201cthird culture\u201d, ideas serve, primarily, as door-openers. All that MIT cared about was that Ito\u2019s ideas supported his networks, his fund-raising skills, and his ability to get donors like Epstein to write fat checks.\n\nIs it so surprising, then, that when a colleague cautioned Ito against meeting Epstein \u2013 who used to list his interests as \u201cscience and pussy\u201d \u2013 Ito described him as \u201creally fascinating\u201d? Brockman, for all his realism about low intellectual standards of the tech community, also couldn\u2019t resist Epstein\u2019s charms, describing him, in an email to me, as \u201cextremely bright and interesting\u201d.\n\nIf the \u201cthird culture\u201d is so much more sophisticated than its predecessors, how come most of its card-carrying members \u2013 famed scientists-cum-brands, courtesy of the Brockman empire \u2013 got caught up in the Epstein mess? It\u2019s not uncommon for intellectuals to serve as useful idiots to the rich and the powerful, but, under the \u201cthird culture\u201d, this reads like a job requirement.\n\nAre the costs of living with this culture \u2013 eg the prostitution of intellectual activity at \u201cbillionaire dinners\u201d\u2013 worth it? And can we still trust what the leading intellectuals of the \u201cthird culture\u201d actually have to say, given, also, what they have to sell?\n\nThe answers to these questions are self-evident. And yet, while it\u2019s easy to attack the rotten apples such as Ito or Negroponte, a more radical transformative agenda should ask for more: close the Media Lab, disband the Ted Talks, refuse the money of tech billionaires, boycott agents like Brockman. Without such drastic changes, the powerful bullshit-industrial complex that is the \u201cthird culture\u201d will continue unharmed, giving cover to the next Epstein.", "description": "The MIT-Epstein debacle shows \u2018the prostitution of intellectual activity\u2019.
