Keough says there are numerous reasons.\n\nFirst and foremost, she says, \u201cThey don\u2019t think they have enough money.\u201d She said the industry can appear out of reach for people. To that end, the company has launched an online investing platform You Invest, which aims to make investing more approachable to newbies. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make it more accessible for people, regardless of how much money they have,\u201d Keough said.\n\nKeough says another reason investing is intimidating is that people, especially millennials, don\u2019t know where to begin.\n\n\u201cHow do we help educate people to make it easier to start? Education has been key for us, we\u2019re really focused on breaking it down so people can start to invest,\u201d Keough adds.\n\nThe survey also found the people lack the confidence to invest.\n\n\u201cWe saw that people who are not investing have much lower confidence in investing and lower confidence that they\u2019ll reach their financial goals,\u201d Keough said. \u201cSo what we can do through education, through helping people just get started, is really build up that confidence.\u201d\n\nRalph Rezza is a production assistant at Yahoo Finance.
