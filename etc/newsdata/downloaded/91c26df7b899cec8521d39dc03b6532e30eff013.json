Try getting a dog.", "language": "en", "text": "The authors undertook the review in an effort to reconcile differences in previously published literature on the topic, some of which showed a benefit to dog ownership while others did not.\n\nAfter reviewing 10 studies that included data on 3.8 million participants, the authors determine that \u201cdog ownership was associated with a 24% risk reduction for all-cause mortality as compared to non-ownership.\u201d The data showed even greater benefits among those who\u2019d experienced cardiovascular issues, such as a heart attack and stroke.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDog ownership,\u201d the authors conclude, \u201cis associated with lower risk of death over the long term, which is possibly driven by a reduction in cardiovascular mortality.\u201d\n\nSo what exactly is it about owning a dog that would make people live longer?\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, cardiologist Dhruv Kazi of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center outlined some of the findings. For starters, there are well-documented mental health benefits to owning a pooch: \u201cDogs offer companionship, reduce anxiety and loneliness, increase self-esteem, and improve overall mood,\u201d Kazi writes. The 2018 General Social Survey, for instance, found that dog owners were happier than cat owners.\n\nAD\n\nThen there are the physical benefits. \u201cSeveral studies have shown that acquiring a dog perforce increases physical exercise (as anyone who has unsuccessfully tried to sleep past the time of a dog\u2019s routine morning walk can attest),\u201d Kazi writes. People who own dogs tend to spend more time outdoors, which is known to be beneficial to health. Simply petting a dog \u2014 especially a familiar one \u2014 lowers a person\u2019s blood pressure.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s plausible that such physical and mental health benefits are the pathway by which dog ownership makes a person live longer. One drawback in the literature, however, is that there haven\u2019t been any randomized controlled trials looking at dog ownership and mortality. Researchers haven\u2019t done many studies, for instance, that direct one group of people to purchase a dog and another group to remain petless, and track their health over a period of time. Those types of studies are considered the gold standard of evidence, what you\u2019d need to be able to say definitively that owning a dog causes people to live longer.\n\nYou\u2019d want to do this to rule out confounding factors. \u201cPet owners tend to be younger, wealthier, better educated, and more likely to be married, all of which improve cardiovascular outcomes,\u201d Kazi writes. It may be the case that being healthier and wealthier causes people to be more likely to acquire a dog.\n\nAD\n\nStill, Kazi writes, the balance of the evidence to date convinces him that \u201cthe association between dog ownership and improved survival is real, and is likely at least partially causal.\u201d One of the larger studies included in the review controlled for a variety of socioeconomic and demographic factors and found that the longevity effect of dog ownership remained.\n\nAD\n\nThere also have been several randomized controlled studies on pet ownership in general, showing direct benefits of owning an animal. In one, a group of cardiac patients who had been randomly instructed to acquire a dog or a cat showed a diminished blood pressure response to stressful situations. In another, researchers randomly assigned nursing home residents in Korea pet crickets and directed them to care for the insects for eight weeks. After that time, the cricket-caring group showed significant improvements on measures of depression and cognitive ability, relative to the control group.\n\n\u201cThe most salient benefits of dog ownership on cardiovascular outcomes,\u201d Kazi writes, \u201care likely mediated through large and sustained improvements in mental health, including lower rates of depression, decreased loneliness, and increased self-esteem.\u201d\n\nThough the current study didn\u2019t examine the effects of cat ownership on mortality, at least one previous paper has explored the connection and found that cat ownership, too, is linked to a decrease in fatal cardiovascular events.\n\nThat suggests that if you\u2019re really serious about living a long life, you should get a dog and a cat to cover all your bases.\n\nAD", "description": "Research published in the journal of the American Heart Association finds that dog ownership is associated with lower mortality rates.
