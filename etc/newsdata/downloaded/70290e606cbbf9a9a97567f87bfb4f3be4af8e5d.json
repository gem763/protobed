I am not because I did nothing wrong. It is the other side, including Schiff and his made up story, that are concerned. Witch Hunt continues! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 26, 2019\n\nTrump sent the tweets Saturday morning as a top State Department official with oversight of Ukraine arrived at the Capitol, where lawmakers are expected to press him on the Trump administration's pressure campaign on foreign leaders.\n\nPhilip Reeker, acting assistant secretary of European and Eurasian Affairs, entered the Capitol shortly after 10:30 a.m. and was ushered into the secure room where three House committees \u2014 Intelligence, Oversight and Reform, and Foreign Affairs \u2014 are conducting the impeachment inquiry into Trump's dealings with Ukraine.\n\nReeker walked silently past a bank of TV cameras and reporters, ignoring a question about whether he was subpoenaed or came voluntarily. An official working on the impeachment inquiry later said that Reeker had been subpoenaed.\n\nLike other career officials' depositions before him, Democrats subpoenaed Reeker to testify amid White House efforts to block current and former administration officials from interviewing with House investigators.\n\n\"In light of an attempt by the State Department to direct Ambassador Philip Reeker not to appear for his scheduled deposition, and efforts by the State Department to also limit any testimony that does occur, the House Intelligence Committee issued a subpoena to compel his testimony,\" according to an official working on the impeachment inquiry. \"As is required of him, Ambassador Reeker is now complying with the subpoena and answering questions.\"\n\nGeorge Kent, a top State Department official who testified earlier this month, brought his concerns to Reeker, one of his superiors, about a shadowy campaign to oust then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, according to emails reportedly given to House investigators by the State Department inspector general.\n\nKent, the deputy assistant secretary of State, also related these concerns to David Hale, a top-ranking State Department official, and to T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, who is close to Secretary of State Michael Pompeo.\n\nDemocrats subpoenaed Brechbuhl as well as two other Trump administration officials for testimony in early November, after they declined to testify voluntarily.\n\nReeker is the ninth witness to be deposed since Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiPelosi: Court ruling 'another blow' to President Trump Elijah Cummings, native son of Baltimore, gets emotional send-off from Democratic luminaries Cummings' staff honor him in op-ed: He brought 'moral clarity' MORE (D-Calif.) announced the launch of a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump, which was prompted by allegations from a government whistleblower that Trump had sought help from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to find dirt on political opponents \u2014 and threatened to withhold U.S. military aid to Kiev if Zelensky didn\u2019t comply.\n\nThe administration\u2019s campaign \u2014 spearheaded by Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiSenate Dems: Barr must recuse himself from Ukraine, Russia probe investigation White House official to corroborate diplomat's version of Ukraine events: report Giuliani accidentally calls reporter, leaves voicemail about needing 'a few hundred thousand' dollars MORE, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer \u2014 resulted in the removal of Yovanovitch in May, after she\u2019d voiced concerns about the effort to press foreign leaders for political favors.\n\nThe rare Saturday session appears to be sparsely attended.

But individuals who have been named in the press as contacts of Mr. Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine,\u201d her prepared remarks read.\n\nThe longtime civil servant said that at the time she learned of her firing, a superior at the State Department informed her that there was a \u201cconcerted campaign against\u201d her and that \u201cthe Department had been under pressure from the President\u201d to remove her since last summer. She strongly denied claims that she made disparaging remarks about Trump, which some critics of hers pointed out to Pompeo.", "description": "President Trump lashed out at congressional Democrats on Saturday over their probe into his dealings with Ukraine ahead of the latest deposition in the impeachment inquiry.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/schiffadam_102619getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
