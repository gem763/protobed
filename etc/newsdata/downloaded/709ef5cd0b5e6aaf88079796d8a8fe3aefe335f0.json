reshape the trajectory of the sport.\n\n\u201cWe as players are playing with the intention of leaving this game better than we entered it,\u201d Kendall Coyne Schofield, an Olympic gold- and silver-medalist, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cAnd we have control over our image, our skill, our talent and ultimately the product we put on the ice.\u201d\n\nThe Dream Gap Tour, a series of exhibition games organized by the PWHPA, kicks off in Toronto, and includes games against Boston College and former members of the NHL\u2019s San Jose Sharks later this month, along with exhibition matches in New Hampshire and Chicago in October.\n\nIn March, the Canadian Women\u2019s Hockey League (CWHL) announced it would fold, leaving the National Women\u2019s Hockey League (NWHL) as the sole viable pro league for women at the time.\n\nHilary Knight, a member of the PWHPA who had previously played in both leagues, told Reuters the tour reflected a need to rethink how women\u2019s professional ice hockey operates.\n\n\u201cThe main goal has always been the main goal: that\u2019s to build a sustainable, viable option and we haven\u2019t seen that quite yet,\u201d said Knight, who has won two Olympic silver medals and one gold with Team USA.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why there\u2019s collective minds that are out there trying to forge a new future for the game.\u201d\n\nTennis and women\u2019s equality pioneer Billie Jean King, whose eponymous company is serving in a leadership and guidance role with the PWHPA, echoed that sentiment.\n\n\u201cIn order for women\u2019s professional hockey to thrive and ensure that young girls have the same opportunity to play in a professional league as young boys, it takes significant investment and infrastructure,\u201d King told Reuters via email.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to ensure these women get the support, platform and professional environment they need.\u201d\n\nLEAGUE \u2018TURBULENCE\u2019\n\nThe tour has the potential to dent the NWHL, once poised to assume the role of North America\u2019s sole pro option, but now contending with some of the sport\u2019s biggest names playing elsewhere.\n\nIts season opener is set for Saturday, Oct. 5.\n\nThe NWHL said in a statement they \u201cwish all the players the best on their events.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe subscribe to the theory that a rising tide lifts all boats,\u201d the NWHL said.\n\nDani Rylan, the founder and commissioner of the NWHL, told Reuters via email that her league is staying on track with its goals.\n\n\u201cEven with all the turbulence, we\u2019ve closed major deals, increased player salaries and the 50-50 revenue share with the players is a sustainable, fair, formula that will allow us to grow at a smart rate,\u201d Rylan said.\n\nBut with a salary cap of $150,000 per team, wages in the NWHL are slim, even with a plan to pour 50% of league-level sponsorship money into the salary pool, and many players take second jobs.\n\nCoyne Schofield, who earlier this year became the first woman to compete in the NHL All-Star Skills Competition, said wages are a sticking point.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not asking for millions, we\u2019re asking for the opportunity to be professionals,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI want to see women graduate from their college hockey days and say, \u2018I want to be a professional hockey player,\u2019 and then get drafted to a city and they pack up their life and they move there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t go where it\u2019s convenient, work 9-5, and get to the rink at 10 o\u2019clock \u2013 that\u2019s not professional.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week the NWHL sold one of its five franchises, the Boston Pride, to a group of investors led by Cannon Capital managing partner Miles Arnone.\n\n\u201cThe PWHPA and the NWHL have the same goal in mind, which is to create a viable women\u2019s professional hockey league that can provide a living wage for its players and good working conditions and growth opportunities,\u201d Arnone told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThe way we in the NWHL are pursuing it is more likely to be successful.\u201d\n\n\u2018A LIVABLE WAGE\u2019\n\nAs with any professional sport, sponsorships and financial support loom large over pro women\u2019s hockey.\n\nThe association and its tour have attracted sponsors including Magellan, Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, Unifor and Budweiser, which signed on to become the PWHPA\u2019s official beer.\n\nOn Friday, the National Hockey League Players\u2019 Association (NHLPA) announced it would also serve as a PWHPA sponsor.\n\nThe NWHL has its own roster of sponsors including Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, and earlier this month Twitch became its exclusive live-streaming partner.\n\nThe NHL has also contributed financially to the NWHL.\n\nMadison Packer, entering her fifth season with the NWHL, told Reuters she understood the PWHPA\u2019s stance, but felt her current league offers the most viable path forward.\n\n\u201cDepending on the market you\u2019re in, is what we make as a salary a livable wage? No,\u201d said Packer. \u201cBut that\u2019s a work in progress.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe salary cap is up this year, there\u2019s more games, there\u2019s more sponsorship money. That\u2019s not something that happens overnight in any sport, men\u2019s or women\u2019s.\u201d", "description": "A coalition of top women's hockey talent is hosting its first public competition in Toronto on Saturday, months after pledging not to join any professional North American league until an economically viable option emerged.", "authors": ["Amy Tennery", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432086752&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J1ZH", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
