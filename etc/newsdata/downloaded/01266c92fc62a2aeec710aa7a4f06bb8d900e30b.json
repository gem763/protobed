(ELI:GALP)'s Upcoming Dividend On The Shelf", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-02", "text": "Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that Galp Energia, SGPS, S.A. (ELI:GALP) is about to go ex-dividend in just 3 days. This means that investors who purchase shares on or after the 6th of September will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 10th of September.\n\nGalp Energia SGPS's upcoming dividend is \u20ac0.32 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of \u20ac0.63 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Galp Energia SGPS has a trailing yield of 4.8% on the current stock price of \u20ac13.06. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to investigate whether Galp Energia SGPS can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Galp Energia SGPS\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Galp Energia SGPS paid out 105% of its earnings, which is more than we're comfortable with, unless there are mitigating circumstances. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out 106% of its free cash flow in the form of dividends last year, which is outside the comfort zone for most businesses. Companies usually need cash more than they need earnings - expenses don't pay themselves - so it's not great to see it paying out so much of its cash flow.\n\nCash is slightly more important than profit from a dividend perspective, but given Galp Energia SGPS's payouts were not well covered by either earnings or cash flow, we would be concerned about the sustainability of this dividend.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.\n\nENXTLS:GALP Historical Dividend Yield, September 2nd 2019 More\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nBusinesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's comforting to see Galp Energia SGPS's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 22% per annum for the past five years. Earnings per share are increasing at a rapid rate, but the company is paying out more than we are comfortable with, based on current earnings. Fast-growing businesses normally need to reinvest most of their earnings in order to maintain growth, so we'd suspect that either earnings growth will slow or the dividend may not be increased for a while.\n\nAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Galp Energia SGPS has lifted its dividend by approximately 8.2% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nShould investors buy Galp Energia SGPS for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share have been growing, despite the company paying out a concerningly high percentage of its earnings and cashflow. We struggle to see how a company paying out so much of its earnings and cash flow will be able to sustain its dividend in a downturn, or reinvest enough into its business to continue growing earnings without borrowing heavily. Overall it doesn't look like the most suitable dividend stock for a long-term buy and hold investor.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be...", "authors": ["Simply Wall St"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rpi5ehqoHGzbNU.dENmspw--~B/aD00MzI7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/02723eee9982272472018586ce0242cd"}
