Little then pulled the woman toward the canal and killed her.\n\nCovington, Kentucky: 1984\n\nFBI\n\nLittle said he was driving his Lincoln Continental Mark III from Loraine, Ohio, to Cincinnati when he met a 25-year-old white woman outside a strip club.\n\nThe woman, who had short blonde hair and blue eyes and stood at about 5 feet 6 inches tall, asked Little for a ride to Miami, where her mother lived.\n\nWhen they reached northern Kentucky, Little said he drove to a hilly area near Interstate 75. After driving up a dirt road, he reached the top of a small hill and then strangled the woman in the back seat of his car.\n\nHe said he left her body on the top of the hill.\n\nLas Vegas: 1993\n\nFBI\n\nLittle said he met a roughly 40-year-old black woman on Owens Avenue or Jackson Street, and described her as thin, about 5 feet 5 inches tall, with a long wig.\n\nHe remembered the victim pointed out her son who was about 19 to 23 years old.\n\nLittle confessed to taking her to a motel room and strangling her.\n\nHe said he then put her body in the trunk of his 1978 yellow Cadillac Eldorado, drove to the outskirts of Las Vegas, headed to a remote road and rolled her body down a steep slope. He said he ditched her clothes down the road.\n\nNorth Little Rock, Arkansas: between 1992 and 1994\n\nFBI\n\nLittle said he met a 24-year-old black woman in a transient area of Little Rock and stayed with her on and off for about three days, possibly in the winter.\n\nLittle said she was about 200 pounds. He believes her name may have been Ruth and her mother lived in North Little Rock.\n\nLittle said the two would shoplift, and records show Little was arrested for shoplifting from a North Little Rock Police grocery store on April 20, 1994.\n\nHe said he was released after about three hours and he found the woman sleeping in his car.\n\nHe said he drove her to meet her ex-boyfriend who went by \"Bear\" and then took her home.\n\nHe said the next day the two drove toward Benton or Bentonville, Arkansas. Once outside Little Rock, Little drove down a dirt road and strangled her to death. He said he then put her body on branches and old cornstalks near a corn field.\n\n'Important to seek justice for each victim'\n\nMark Rogers/Odessa American via AP\n\nLittle is serving multiple life sentences in California. This August he pleaded guilty to the murders of four women in Ohio and last year he pleaded guilty to a killing in Texas.\n\n\"Even though he is already in prison, the FBI believes it is important to seek justice for each victim,\" said Christie Palazzolo, an analyst with the FBI's Violent Criminal Apprehension Program.\n\nAnyone with information is asked to call 1-800-CALL-FBI.", "description": "Samuel Little has confessed to dozens of murders dating back to the 1970s.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/samuel-little-ap-mo-20190608_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
