If it were about science it would be led by scientists, not politicians and a mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left.\u201d\n\nWhen challenged by left-wing pundit Chris Hahn, Mr Knowles reiterated that she \u201chas many mental illnesses\u201d.\n\nHis comments came after the teenager gave a severe and impassioned speech to the United Nations climate change summit, telling world leaders and officials from about 60 countries \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet, you all come to us young people for hope? How dare you. You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.\u201d\n\nFox News has since apologised to the 16-year-old for the conservative podcast host\u2019s comments, adding they have \u201cno plans\u201d to feature Mr Knowles on the channel in the future.\n\nA spokesperson told the Hollywood Reporter: \u201cThe comment made by Michael Knowles who was a guest on The Story tonight was disgraceful \u2014 we apologise to Greta Thunberg and to our viewers.\"\n\nThe pundit\u2019s comment drew criticism for groups who speak out for people living with autistic spectrum disorder. Julia Bascom, executive director of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, said \u201cIt's absolutely unconscionable to attack someone for their disability, especially when that person is a child.\n\n\u201cHistory is full of autistic people and people with other cognitive disabilities who were and are compelling, credible activists and leaders. Greta is a part of that tradition, and our community is lucky to have her. Period.\"\n\nMs Thunberg has faced repeated criticism and comments on her condition, particularly from climate change sceptics, after issuing blunt warnings to world leaders about the state of the planet, but has described her Asperger\u2019s as a \u201csuperpower\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen haters go after your looks and differences, it means they have nowhere left to go\u201d, she wrote on Twitter in August. \u201cI'm not public about my diagnosis to \u2018hide\u2019 behind it, but because I know many ignorant people still see it as an 'illness', or something negative. And believe me, my diagnosis has limited me before.\n\n\u201cBefore I started school striking I had no energy, no friends and I didn\u2019t speak to anyone. I just sat alone at home, with an eating disorder. All of that is gone now, since I have found a meaning, in a world that sometimes seems shallow and meaningless to so many people.\u201d\n\nThe activist has also repeatedly faced claims that she has been indoctrinated by her opera singer mother and actor father, although her parents insist that it was her who convinced them of the urgent need to address climate change.\n\nIn an interview with the Guardian in July, her father Svante Thunberg said \u201cShe kept showing us documentaries, and we read books together. Before that, I really didn\u2019t have a clue. I thought we had the climate issue sorted.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nRead more Critics may attack Greta Thunberg, but the data speaks for itself\n\n---Watch the latest videos from Yahoo UK---", "description": "Fox News has apologised to Greta Thunberg after a conservative pundit described the climate activist as a \u201cmentally ill Swedish child\u201d on the cable news channel.Michael Knowles, who hosts a podcast for Ben Shapiro's right-wing website the Daily Wire, argued the new wave of climate activism inspired", "authors": ["Vincent Wood"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gXoHlghaC71osbjZv6hsvQ--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/c3a65eb350ae509d8681ca3014d0ef09", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
