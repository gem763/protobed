You could easily crisp some pancetta before the garlic hits the pan or stir in some anchovies right before you begin to braise. This dish can be made a day or two in advance and gently reheated with a splash of water or broth, but wait until right before serving to garnish it with the fresh herbs. (They'll lose their vibrant color otherwise.) Serve over polenta or rice pilaf.", "description": "In this satisfying weeknight recipe, boneless chicken thighs are cooked in best-quality balsamic and red wine vinegar and plenty of garlic, resulting in a pleasantly sticky agrodolce sauce You could easily crisp some pancetta before the garlic hits the pan or stir in some anchovies right before you begin to braise This dish can be made a day or two in advance and gently reheated with a splash of water or broth, but wait until right before serving to garnish it with the fresh herbs", "authors": ["Colu Henry", "Mark Bittman", "Florence Fabricant", "Tejal Rao", "Barbara Kafka", "Molly O'Neill", "Lidey Heuck", "Samin Nosrat", "Melissa Clark", "Marian Burros"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/11/dining/colu-vinegar-chicken-horizontal/colu-vinegar-chicken-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2018-07-11"}
