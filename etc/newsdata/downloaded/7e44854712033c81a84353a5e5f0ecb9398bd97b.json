The latter pivots to first support.\n\nConversely, additional overhead matches the former breakdown point (2,989). The October peak (2,993), established Friday, registered nominally higher, and the prevailing pullback from this area has been flat. Constructive price action.\n\nSimilarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.94% has reclaimed key levels.\n\nConsider that the top of last week\u2019s gap (26,694) matched the April peak (26,696) an inflection point also detailed on the daily chart.\n\nHere again, the initial selling pressure near the range top has registered as flat.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.17% has reached a headline technical test.\n\nRecall that last week\u2019s close (8,057) matched major resistance (8,059), an intermediate-term inflection point, detailed repeatedly. An extended retest remains underway.\n\nWidening the view to six months adds perspective.\n\nOn this wider view, the Nasdaq has gapped atop the 50-day moving average, rising to nail next resistance.\n\nTo reiterate, the July gap (8,059) closely matches the September gap (8,061) and marks a bull-bear inflection point. A close higher would mark an escape from the former August range, signaling a bullish intermediate-term bias. (Also see the Oct. 8 review.)\n\nMore broadly, the prevailing upturn punctuates a successful test of the 200-day moving average at the October low.\n\nLooking elsewhere, the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains comparably stronger than the Nasdaq.\n\nTo reiterate, the top of last week\u2019s gap (26,694) matched an inflection point at the April peak (26,696). The gap to a higher plateau is constructive.\n\nThe prevailing upturn builds on the Dow\u2019s break atop the 50-day moving average and the August range top (26,427), signaling a bullish intermediate-term bias.\n\nOn further strength, additional overhead matches the July gap (27,088).\n\nSimilarly, the S&P 500 has knifed to a higher plateau.\n\nLast week\u2019s trade-fueled spike places the index above the August range top (2,943) and the September gap (2,960).\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nCollectively, the major U.S. benchmarks have absorbed the early-October market downdraft.\n\nOn a headline basis, the S&P 500 and Dow industrials have reclaimed major resistance \u2014 levels matching the former August range top \u2014 while the Nasdaq Composite has nailed its corresponding resistance (8,060).\n\nThe Nasdaq has ventured atop the 8,060 area with Tuesday\u2019s strong start, though as always, it\u2019s the close that matters.\n\nMoving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF remains the weakest widely-tracked U.S. benchmark.\n\nStill, the prevailing upturn places the 50-day moving average (150.57) and 200-day moving average (152.10) under siege. A close atop the trending indicators would mark technical progress.\n\nMeanwhile, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 has gapped atop its 50- and 200-day moving averages.\n\nRecall that the 50-day moving average, currently 346.75, has marked a 2019 inflection point.\n\nLooking elsewhere, the SPDR Trust S&P 500 SPY, +1.07% has reached a higher plateau, rising atop major resistance matching the May peak (294.95).\n\nMore broadly, the SPY has flip-flopped ranges since July. Before October, the prior three ranges spanned almost precisely one month each.\n\nPlacing a finer point on the S&P 500, its backdrop remains jagged, but straightforward.\n\nTo start, the index has reclaimed its 50-day moving average, currently 2,939, as well as major resistance matching the August range top (2,943) and the September gap (2,960).\n\nFrom current levels, additional overhead matches the former breakdown point (2,989) and is followed by an inflection point, circa 3,007.\n\nOn further strength, the September peak (3,022) roughly matches the S&P\u2019s record close (3,025.9) and absolute record peak (3,028), both established July 26. The pending retest from underneath should be a useful bull-bear gauge.\n\nMore broadly, the S&P 500\u2019s escape from the former August range signals a bullish intermediate-term bias, to the extent it is sustained. The response to third-quarter earnings reports, set to begin this week, will also add color.\n\nAlso see: Charting October technical damage, S&P 500 whipsaws at major resistance.\n\nTuesday\u2019s Watch List\n\nThe charts below detail names that are technically well positioned. These are radar screen names \u2014 sectors or stocks poised to move in the near term. For the original comments on the stocks below, see The Technical Indicator Library.\n\nDrilling down further, the iShares China Large-Cap ETF FXI, +0.89% has come to life, rising amid optimism over China-U.S. trade talks.\n\nAs illustrated, the shares have recently averted a return to the August range, exhibiting relative strength versus the major U.S. benchmarks in this respect. The prevailing upturn preserves a bullish island reversal, defined by the August range, and related gaps.\n\nMore immediately, the shares have rallied atop trendline resistance (41.00) raising the flag to a trend shift. The upturn resolves a modified head-and-shoulders bottom defined by the May, August and September lows. (Combined, the FXI is rising from tandem high-reliability reversal patterns.)\n\nAdditional overhead matches the 200-day moving average, currently 41.87, and the September peak (41.97). A close atop this area would mark a \u201chigher high\u201d more firmly signaling a trend shift.\n\nMoving to U.S. sectors, the iShares Transportation Average ETF IYT, +1.47% is traversing a familiar range.\n\nIn fact, the range is so well-defined that the 50- and 200-day moving averages closely match, and almost precisely bisect it.\n\nMore broadly, the July and September peaks punctuated failed tests of the range top (failed breakout attempts), while the August and October lows have marked successful tests of the range bottom.\n\nTactically, the 185 area matches the group\u2019s breakdown point as well as the major moving averages. A sustained break higher strengthens the bull case, likely opening the path to the next test of the range top. The next several sessions, and the response to key earnings reports, should add color.\n\nMoving to specific names, Jabil Inc. JBL, +2.08% is a well positioned large-cap contract manufacturer.\n\nLate last month, the shares knifed to 13-year highs, rising after the company\u2019s strong fourth-quarter results.\n\nThe ensuing pullback has been orderly, fueled by decreased volume, positioning the shares to build on the September spike. Tactically, a near-term floor matches the post-breakout low (34.10) and a posture higher supports a firmly bullish bias.\n\nSkyworks Solutions, Inc. SWKS, +1.84% is a large-cap semiconductor name, and an Apple, Inc. supplier. (Yield = 2.0%.)\n\nTechnically, the shares have recently gapped atop trendline resistance, reaching two-month highs after an analyst upgrade.\n\nThe rally punctuates a symmetrical triangle bisected by the major moving averages. Tactically, the top of the gap (83.60) closely matches the trendline, and the rally attempt is intact barring a violation.\n\nFinally, Beazer Homes USA, Inc. BZH, +1.24% is a small-cap homebuilder positioned to rise.\n\nThe shares started October with a bull-flag breakout, rising to 52-week highs. By comparison, the subsequent pullback has been flat, fueled by decreased volume, positioning the shares to extend the uptrend.\n\nTactically, the 20-day moving average has defined the trend, and is followed by the deeper breakout point (14.30). The uptrend is firmly intact barring a violation.\n\nStill well positioned\n\nThe table below includes names recently profiled in The Technical Indicator that remain well positioned.
