(Frank Franklin II/AP)\n\nMcKrae Game wants people to know that he was wrong about all of it.\n\nHe was wrong to found Hope for Wholeness Network, a faith-based conversion therapy program that seeks to rid people of their LGBTQ identities. He was wrong to create a slogan promoting the idea of \u201cfreedom from homosexuality through Jesus Christ.\u201d He was wrong to tell people they were doomed for all eternity if they didn\u2019t change their ways.\n\nAfter 20 years working in that field, Game said he realizes the harm he has caused and that he, himself, is gay. Conversion therapy encompasses a widely discredited range of methods that purport to change someone\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity. The practice is illegal in 18 states and the District.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all in my past, but many, way TOO MANY continue believing that there is something wrong with themselves and wrong with people that choose to live their lives honestly and open as gay, lesbian, trans, etc.,\u201d Game, 51, wrote on Facebook last week. \u201cThe very harmful cycle of self shame and condemnation has to stop.\u201d\n\nHope for Wholeness, based in South Carolina and known as one of the nation\u2019s most prominent conversion therapy centers, did not respond Tuesday to requests for comment. Game could not be reached.\n\n[To some, this queer couple look straight. For him, that\u2019s okay. But for her, it feels \u2018like a lie.\u2019 Add to list]\n\nGame is among many founders and leaders of conversion therapy programs to disavow the practice later. In 2014, nine former \u201cex-gay\u201d leaders signed an open letter denouncing conversion therapy as \u201cineffective and harmful\u201d and calling for an end to it. A Latter-day Saint counselor who practiced conversion therapy said in January that he was gay and that he \u201cunequivocally renounces\u201d ex-gay ministry.\n\nGame announced in June that he was gay, almost two years after Hope for Wholeness\u2019s board of directors fired him, The Post and Courier reported. In his Facebook post, he said all conversion therapy programs should be closed, but that he would support them becoming support groups for people who believe being LGBTQ is incongruous with their faith.\n\n\u201cI was a religious zealot that hurt people,\u201d Game told The Post and Courier. \u201cPeople said they attempted suicide over me and the things I said to them. People, I know, are in therapy because of me. Why would I want that to continue?\u201d\n\nLeaders of conversion therapy programs rarely renounce the practice publicly because doing so involves turning their backs not just on the ex-gay community, but also on conservative faith as a whole, said Alan Chambers, the former president of Exodus International. Exodus was the world\u2019s largest conversion therapy ministry until Chambers shut it down in 2013 and apologized to the LGBTQ community.\n\n\u201cOftentimes, not only do you lose the relationships of people in the community that you\u2019ve been in, but you lose your church,\u201d Chambers told The Washington Post. \u201cSometimes you lose your family. Sometimes you lose everything.\u201d\n\n[There\u2019s no one \u2018gay gene,\u2019 but genetics are linked to same-sex behavior, new study says]\n\nChambers, who said he is \u201ca gay man married to a straight woman,\u201d said his decision to reject conversion therapy developed slowly over decades. He said he was particularly struck by the devastated reactions he saw to California\u2019s passing the now-defunct Proposition 8, a constitutional amendment that in 2008 banned same-sex marriage there. Chambers now advocates for an end to conversion therapy for minors and for including LGBTQ people in faith communities.\n\nMel White, a former ghostwriter for high-profile evangelical Christians, describes himself as \u201ca victim of the ex-gay movement.\u201d White said when he was married to a woman and believed his same-sex attractions were sinful, he tried every kind of conversion therapy in the book: He took cold showers, subjected himself to electric therapy and got an exorcism. He and his wife paid more than $1,000 for the treatment, he said, and none of it worked.\n\nEventually, White said he couldn\u2019t live that way anymore. He and his wife divorced, and he has been married to a man for 37 years. He said he eventually came to believe that God loves him exactly as he was created, and he stopped ghostwriting autobiographies for the likes of Jerry Falwell and Billy Graham.\n\nWhite said he believes Christianity is the greatest source of suffering for LGBTQ people, and he co-founded the organization Soulforce to combat what he sees as this oppression. The organization promotes nonviolent resistance to religious fundamentalism.\n\nAfter spending years working with the conservative Christian right, White said he has \u201cspent the rest of my life trying to redeem myself from having anything to do with that ex-gay system.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nPence isn\u2019t \u2018anti-gay\u2019 because he lunched with Irish prime minister, who is gay, White House aide said\n\n\u2018A black vote for Trump is mental illness,\u2019 sign outside Baptist church declares\n\nMormon leaders explicitly ban guns from houses of worship\n\nHe terrorized gay communities from D.C. to Florida.
