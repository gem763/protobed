Critics say that decision left Kurdish occupants, who've assisted the U.S. in containing ISIS in the region, vulnerable to an invasion from Turkey.\n\n\"To turn his back on those Kurdish fighters whose intelligence and help located al-Baghdadi in the first place and made sure that we were successful,\" O'Rourke said.\n\nISIS SPOKESMAN ABU HASSAN AL-MUHAJIR, POTENTIAL AL-BAGHDADI SUCCESSOR, ALSO KILLED IN SYRIA, OFFICIAL SAYS\n\n\"His precipitous withdrawal that created a void that Turkey and Russia, Iran and I.S.I.S. and Assad have all come in to -- it is really a miracle that we were able to do this but it is really owing to our allies, our friends, our partners on the ground and those great service members who put their lives on the line to ensure that there is justice for this country.\u201d\n\nO'Rourke was echoing criticism of Trump's decision -- namely, that he abandoned Kurdish allies and allowed Turkey's subsequent incursion into Syria.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn a statement from the White House, Trump thanked Kurdish allies but also indicated his administration shared credit for the attack.\n\n\"Baghdadi has been on the run for many years, long before I took office. At my direction, as commander-in-chief, the United States obliterated his \u2018caliphate\u2019 in March of this year. Today\u2019s events are another reminder that we will continue to pursue the remaining ISIS terrorists to their brutal end,\" he said.", "description": "Beto O'Rourke, a former congressman and 2020 candidate, advanced the theory that President Trump might have hindered the U.S.'s ability to take down ISIS leader\u00a0Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.", "authors": ["Sam Dorman", "Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News.
