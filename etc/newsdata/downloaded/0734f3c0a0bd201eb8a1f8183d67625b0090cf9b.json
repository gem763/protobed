We will never leave you\u2019.\u201d https://t.co/FEJUdJGGu6 \u2014 Jennifer Griffin (@JenGriffinFNC) October 21, 2019\n\nWhile Trump enjoys unwavering support at Fox News from several opinion hosts and supportive guests, a daily cheering section that serves as media firewall in the face of impeachment, the president\u2019s claims about withdrawing troops, and thereby allowing Turkey to launch an offensive in northern Syria, have come under near-constant scrutiny from Griffin, a veteran national security correspondent at the network.\n\nGriffin\u2019s critical reporting in recent weeks has not only found a home on several daytime Fox News programs, albeit not in prime time, but has been cited by competitors like MSNBC\u2019s Willie Geist and CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour. Members of U.S. special forces, Amanpour told Defense Secretary Mark Esper, \u201care telling even Fox News \u2014 that\u2019s an ally of president Trump\u2026that they feel ashamed.\u201d\n\nA Republican critic of the Syria withdrawal, Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, referenced Griffin\u2019s reporting on CNN, while conservative writers like Peggy Noonan, Peter Wehner, and Jonah Goldberg have done so in pieces opposing the decision. Goldberg noted that Griffin\u2019s reporting is coming from Fox News, which is \u201cnot normally a target of Trump\u2019s \u2018fake news\u2019 broadsides.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased at the fact that other networks are paying attention to what Fox News is doing, but the way I feel is, we\u2019ve been doing this for years,\u201d Griffin said in an interview with POLITICO. She said Fox News reporters \u201ckeep our nose to the grindstone\u201d and \u201ckeep out of politics.\u201d\n\nThat can be difficult as Trump, a faithful Fox News viewer, has blasted journalists who have challenged his claims, such as veteran anchor Shepard Smith, who abruptly left the network earlier this month amid tensions with the pro-Trump opinion side.\n\n\u201cI certainly was very saddened to see that Shepard was leaving us,\u201d said Griffin, who considers the former Fox News anchor a close friend from their more than two decades at the network. But, she said, \u201cWe\u2019re not doing anything differently since he left.\u201d\n\nGriffin\u2019s work on the Syria story began a few days before Smith exited Fox News. She and husband Greg Myre, an NPR national security correspondent, returned to the U.S. from an anniversary trip in Morocco on Oct. 6 to find Trump announcing plans to withdraw troops in Syria.\n\n\u201cThis came as a surprise to everyone \u2014 not just reporters, but members of the national security establishment,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cMuch of the Pentagon was caught off guard. The State Department was caught off guard.\u201d\n\nGriffin, who had spent years reporting from the Middle East before starting on the Pentagon beat in 2007, began contacting sources, and said she and colleague Lucas Tomlinson started piecing together \u201cwhat the reality was, because there was a lot of confusion and misinformation.\u201d\n\nOn the afternoon of Oct. 7, Griffin reported on Fox News how U.S. officials and allies were blindsided by Trump\u2019s decision. Two days later, she reported how Trump \u201cwent off script\u201d during his call with Erdogan, whom he was expected to tell to stay north of the Syrian border.\n\nThat same day, Griffin tweeted thoughts from a distraught \u201cU.S. Special Forces soldier\u201d who fought alongside the Kurds and said he was \u201cashamed for the first time in my career.\u201d The string of tweets went viral, drawing more than 400,000 likes and retweets and surely contributed to Griffin adding at least 20,000 Twitter followers this month.\n\nIn another widely shared tweet, Griffin last week accused Trump of pushing a \u201cTurkish talking point\u201d that the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) is \u201ca greater threat than ISIS.\u201d On Sunday, she posted several tweets from a call with Kurdish general Mazloum Kobani Abdi, a key U.S. partner in the fight against ISIS, who accused accused Turkey of ignoring a cease fire and continuing its \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d in northern Syria.\n\nThe next night, Griffin interviewed former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen at the University of Chicago, and was back at the Pentagon on Tuesday, reporting on Turkey and Russia\u2019s deal to jointly patrol along the safe zone at the Syria border.\n\nGriffin also appeared this week on a Fox News Radio show with Brian Kilmeade, a co-host on Trump favorite \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d who has expressed criticism of the Syria move. Yet Griffin has not appeared in recent weeks on any Fox News opinion shows, which she said isn\u2019t unusual as her TV appearances typically occur between 11 a.m. and 7 p.m.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in the opinion-making business,\u201d Griffin said of the primetime line-up. \u201cAnd they\u2019re having guests on who can commentate on the news reports that we\u2019ve put out during the day. That\u2019s usually how they structure their shows. But there\u2019s no hard and fast rule that I can\u2019t appear on there.\u201d\n\nGriffin acknowledged that some people who don\u2019t know her \u201cmight make certain assumptions\u201d because of her employer, though she believes that most \u201cview me as an individual.\u201d\n\nThat assessment jibes with those of her colleagues in the Pentagon press corps.\n\n\u201cAs far as the Pentagon press corps goes, she\u2019s one of us,\u201d said Jeff Schogol, a Pentagon reporter at Task & Purpose. \u201cIt\u2019s not that Jennifer\u2019s the Pentagon Fox reporter, she\u2019s a Pentagon reporter. So of course, standards of accuracy and fairness are the same for her as anyone else.\u201d\n\nKevin Baron, executive editor of Defense One, called Griffin \u201ca pro's pro\u201d and \u201cone of the best reporters I've seen my decade on the Pentagon beat.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer reputation as a hard-hitting, straight-talking journalist is known by her peers and respected worldwide throughout the military from generals to grunts,\u201d said Baron. \u201cNever seen her pull a punch. Would be shocked if she ever did.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/44/06/97044d264619b7f5127b29c4488b/20191023-griffin-fox-news-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
