With 434 votes needed and only 288 Conservatives in the Commons, he will need around 150 opposition MPs and independents to join him.\n\nMr Johnson said it would be \u201cmorally incredible\u201d if Labour blocked the election for a third time.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Under electoral laws, the motion for Monday\u2019s vote cannot include the proposed election date, leaving Mr Johnson to announce it after he has secured permission to dissolve parliament.\n\nA Downing Street source said that \u2013 despite having secured a majority at second reading for his Withdrawal Agreement Bill \u2013 if he is denied an election on Monday, the prime minister will make no further attempt to force his Brexit deal through parliament by the new 31 January deadline expected to be offered by the European Union on Friday.\n\nInstead, he would table only a bare minimum of legislation in parliament and focus the government\u2019s efforts on pushing for a general election by whatever means are available. These could potentially include a bill to override fixed-term parliaments legislation or even a vote of no confidence in his own government. Chancellor Sajid Javid announced he has cancelled the budget planned for 6 November.\n\n\u201cThe worry is that parliament will just waste the next three months the same way they have wasted the last three years,\u201d said the source. \u201cThe Labour Party can\u2019t try to keep this country hostage by saying they are not going to vote for this deal but they are not going to be held accountable to the electorate.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to Corbyn, the prime minister said that if the date was approved, the government would make as much time available as possible up to 6 November to scrutinise and pass the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, including weekends and extended sitting hours. It is understood the government is ready to order another Saturday sitting this weekend to get the process under way.\n\nThe PM\u2019s announcement came despite deep division within the cabinet and among his No 10 advisers over the wisdom of going to the country before EU withdrawal is complete.\n\nMinisters including Julian Smith, Nicky Morgan and Matt Hancock were thought to be wary of an onslaught from Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party costing Tories the votes of Leave-backers frustrated at the PM\u2019s failure to hit his Halloween deadline.\n\nA ComRes poll taken on 16-17 October suggested the recent Tory poll lead could vanish if Brexit is delayed beyond 31 October, with 27 per cent saying the would back Labour, against 26 per cent for Conservatives and 20 per cent for Mr Farage\u2019s party.\n\nBut Mr Johnson\u2019s powerful aide Dominic Cummings has argued for an early poll, which he believes will allow Conservatives to secure a working majority on the back of a \u201cpeople vs the parliament\u201d message.\n\nIf approved in Monday\u2019s vote, the Johnson election would be the first in December since 1923. MPs raised concern about the willingness of activists to campaign and voters to turn out in potentially cold, wet and dark conditions. It has the potential merit for Conservatives of falling during university holidays, when students may not be as committed to voting.\n\nMr Johnson made clear that if his Brexit bill is not passed by 6 November, he will fight the election campaign on a plea to voters to give him the kind of majority he needs to allow him to ratify his deal in the New Year and take the UK out of the European Union by the end of January.\n\nIn his letter to Mr Corbyn, Mr Johnson wrote: \u201cThis parliament has refused to take decisions. It cannot refuse to let the voters replace it with a new parliament that can make decisions.\n\n\u201cProlonging this paralysis into 2020 would have dangerous consequences for businesses, jobs and for basic confidence in democratic institutions, already badly damaged by the behaviour of parliament since the referendum. Parliament cannot continue to hold the country hostage.\u201d\n\nSNP leader Nicola Sturgeon indicated her party would oppose an election: \u201cJohnson appears to be saying to MPs \u2018If you vote for an election, I\u2019ll bring back my bad Brexit bill and try to drag us out of the EU before we go to the polls\u2019.\n\n\u201cElections should be exercises in letting voters decide, not devices for charlatans to get their own way.\u201d\n\nAnd Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said: \u201cBoris Johnson is trying to distract from his government\u2019s failure. He has missed his do-or-die deadline and is now demanding that parliament give him a general election and the time to ram through his Bill without proper scrutiny.\n\n\u201cThe Liberal Democrats will not support any election until it is clear that we can avoid crashing out with no deal, and that needs an extension from the EU.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson\u2019s gamble on an early election looks set to flop, after opposition parties signalled they will block a poll so long as a no-deal Brexit remains possible.
