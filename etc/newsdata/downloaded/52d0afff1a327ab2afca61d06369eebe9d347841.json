Would Biden have done the same?", "language": "en", "text": "Would Joe Biden have done the same? Unlikely.\n\nThe former vice president advised Barack Obama not to carry out the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. As Mark Bowden, author of \u201cThe Finish: The Killing of Osama bin Laden,\u201d explained in 2012, \u201cThe only major dissenters were Biden and [then-Defense Secretary Robert] Gates, and before the raid was launched, Gates would change his mind.\u201d During a meeting in the Situation Room, Biden later recalled, Obama turned to him and asked, \u201cJoe, what do you think?\u201d Biden answered, \u201cMr. President, my suggestion is don\u2019t go.\u201d Worse, his reason had nothing to do with national security. According to Bowden, Biden told the president that \u201cif the effort failed, Obama could say goodbye to a second term.\u201d At the moment America had the man responsible for the 9/11 attacks in her sights, Biden was worried about politics, the absolute last thing a commander in chief should be thinking about in such circumstances. In the end, Bowden writes, \u201cevery one of the president\u2019s top advisers except Biden was in favor of immediate action.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYet, rather than praise Trump for ordering the killing of Baghdadi, Biden blasted the president, declaring the raid succeeded \u201cdespite his ineptitude as commander in chief.\u201d The man who opposed the bin Laden operation criticizes the man who approved the Baghdadi operation? That\u2019s rich. And it was the Obama-Biden administration\u2019s withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 that allowed the Islamic State to rise from the ashes of defeat and build a caliphate the size of Britain. Talk about ineptitude.\n\nObama\u2019s rejection of Biden\u2019s advice not to go after bin Laden does not absolve Obama of criticism for his broader policy in the fight against terrorism. After the bin Laden operation, many pointed out the irony that Obama\u2019s signature national security accomplishment was made possible by information gained from the CIA interrogation program that he had shut down on his third day in office. As former acting CIA director Mike Morrell has explained, the key piece of intelligence that led the CIA to bin Laden \u2014 information on bin Laden\u2019s principal courier, including his nickname Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti \u2014 came from detainees in CIA custody.\n\nSimilarly, Trump\u2019s bold decision to go forward with the Baghdadi operation does not absolve him of criticism for his Syria policy. The fact is, taking out the Islamic State leader would not have been possible without the U.S. boots on the ground that Trump has announced he is withdrawing, or without the help of the Kurdish allies whom Trump is abandoning. It was the Kurds who cultivated the source inside Baghdadi\u2019s inner circle who gave us actionable intelligence about his location. So, the Kurds not only took 11,000 casualties in the fight to drive the Islamic State from its physical caliphate, but they also gave us the critical lead that led us to Baghdadi\u2019s doorstep. It\u2019s fair to ask whether the same operation would have been possible six months from now thanks to Trump\u2019s drawdown and betrayal of the Kurds.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOur Kurdish allies deserve better. And we still need them. According to a Pentagon inspector general\u2019s report, even before Trump\u2019s most recent withdrawal announcement, the Islamic State was \u201cresurging in Syria.\u201d It has between 14,000 and 18,000 members, as well as about 3,000 foreign fighters under arms in Syria and Iraq. The New York Times reports that before Trump\u2019s decision to greenlight Turkey\u2019s invasion, Kurdish forces were conducting as many as a dozen counterterrorism missions a day, but now those have ceased. The Kurds were also guarding about 10,000 captured Islamic State fighters, including about 2,000 foreign fighters. Now, according to the State Department, more than 100 of those detainees have escaped and \u201cwe do not know where they are.\u201d\n\nAnd while the loss of Baghdadi is a major blow, the Islamic State has survived similar blows before. In 2006, I helped write President George W. Bush\u2019s speech announcing that the United States had killed Baghdadi\u2019s predecessor Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Thirteen years later, another American president has announced the death of another Islamic State leader. Thanks to Trump, Baghdadi is dead. But the Islamic State is not. We still need to keep a boot on its neck, and that requires boots on the ground \u2014 and allies such as the Kurds.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The man who opposed the bin Laden operation criticizes the man who approved the Baghdadi operation.
