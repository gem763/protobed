REUTERS/Sekar Nasly\n\nContributing factors to the crash of the new Boeing (BA.N) jet, which killed all 189 on board, included incorrect assumptions on how an anti-stall device called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) functioned and how pilots would react, slides in the presentation showed.\n\nThe briefing slides also showed that a lack of documentation about how systems would behave in the crash scenario, including the activation of a \u201cstick shaker\u201d device that warned pilots of a dangerous loss of lift, also contributed.\n\n\u201cDeficiencies\u201d in the flight crew\u2019s communication and manual control of the aircraft contributed as well, the slides showed, as did alerts and distractions in the cockpit.\n\nThe deficiencies had been \u201cidentified during training,\u201d the slides said, without adding details.\n\nReliance on a single angle-of-attack sensor made the MCAS system more vulnerable to failure, while the sensor on the plane that crashed had been miscalibrated during an earlier repair, according to the slides.\n\nThe final report will be released on Friday.\n\nA Boeing spokeswoman declined to comment on the briefing, saying, \u201cAs the report hasn\u2019t been officially released by the authorities, it is premature for us to comment on its contents.\u201d\n\nA Lion Air representative declined to comment.\n\nThe 737 MAX was grounded worldwide after a second deadly crash in Ethiopia in March 2019.\n\nU.S. planemaker Boeing is under growing pressure to explain what it knew about 737 MAX problems before the aircraft entered service, especially after a Reuters report on messages from a former test pilot describing erratic software behaviour on the 737 MAX jet two years before recent crashes.\n\nBoeing has already said it would redesign the anti-stall system to rely on more than a single sensor and to help reduce pilot workload.\n\nThe planemaker is set to release third-quarter financial results later Wednesday.\n\nLION AIR FLIGHT\n\nContact with the Boeing 737 MAX jet was lost 13 minutes after it took off on Oct. 29 from the capital, Jakarta, heading north to the tin-mining town of Pangkal Pinang.\n\nThe airplane had suffered a sequence of problems in cockpit readings since Oct. 26, culminating in a decision to change the angle-of-attack sensor before the penultimate flight from Denpasar to Jakarta.\n\nDuring the fatal night-time flight, a \u201cstick shaker\u201d was vibrating the captain\u2019s controls, warning of a stall throughout most of the 13 minutes aloft, based on what investigators believe to have been erroneous data on its angle to the oncoming air.\n\nThat angle is a key flight parameter that must remain narrow enough to preserve lift and avoid an aerodynamic stall.\n\nThe airplane\u2019s anti-stall system repeatedly pushed the nose down, which is how pilots usually get air under the wings.\n\nBoeing was widely criticised for placing emphasis on piloting and maintenance issues in its public response to an earlier report, sparking a furious dispute with Lion Air\u2019s cofounder, Rusdi Kirana.\n\nBut it has since acknowledged that MCAS and a faulty sensor played a role, and apologised for lives lost without admitting formal responsibility.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe planemaker last month settled the first claims stemming from the Lion Air crash, a U.S. plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer said.\n\nThree other sources told Reuters the families of those killed will receive at least $1.2 million each.\n\nThe manufacturer faces nearly 100 lawsuits over the Ethiopian Airlines crash on March 10, which killed all 157 people on board the flight from Addis Ababa to Nairobi.", "description": "Mechanical and design issues contributed to the crash of a Lion Air 737 MAX jet last October, Indonesian investigators told victims' families in a briefing on Wednesday ahead of the release of a final report.", "authors": ["Jessica Damiana", "Bernadette Christina Munthe", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444003760&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0DM", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
