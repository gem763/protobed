Maggie Wong/CNN\n\nTung Po's different from most restaurants located inside cooked food centers and wet markets -- popular among locals in search of no-frills cheap but delicious eats -- thanks to one person: the restaurant's energetic owner Robby Cheung.\n\nWearing an apron and a pair of white wellington boots with tops scissored into zig-zag shapes, Cheung is often seen doing the splits, drinking, dancing and taking selfies with customers.\n\n\"The people just enjoy the food, enjoy the music and we dance together,\" the 55-year-old tells CNN. \"I just like to dance. I'm 55 years old right now and I still dance. It [would be] so sad if I can't dance -- that would mean that I'm very old.\"\n\nRelated content Hong Kong's best dim sum\n\n'Favorite dish is black ink squid, because it's funny'\n\nWind Sand Chicken is marinated and deep-fried till its skin is crispy but the meat remains moist.

When you eat the black ink squid, you get a black mouth and black teeth.\"\n\nOther Tung Po signature dishes include Wind Sand Chicken, fried rice with duck sauce wrapped in lotus leaf and deep fried giant grouper with black pepper and toast.\n\nRelated content 17 beautiful places to see in Hong Kong\n\nTourist attraction\n\nTravelers around the world come to Tung Po to experience its famously rowdy atmosphere.

Over 60% is girls, office ladies,\" says Cheung.\n\nLike everything else in Tung Po, drinking beer is a dramatic affair.\n\nInstead of a glass, beer is served in an iced \"battle beer bowl\" -- a blue and white bowl with the Chinese word \"victory\" printed on the bottom.\n\nIn Cantonese, yum sing (literally translated as drink victory) means bottoms up.\n\nRelated content Top 10 things for visitors to do in Hong Kong\n\nThe ultimate party trick\n\nWith \"Billie Jean\" booming in the background, Cheung moonwalks to a table to deliver beers to his customers.\n\nThen he shows off one of Tung Po diners' favorite tricks -- opening a beer bottle with a chopstick.\n\n\"A long, long time ago -- before we opened this restaurant, I saw it once outside a restaurant when they opened it with a chopstick,\" he recalls.\n\n\"It was quite funny. Sometimes when a gweilo [foreigner in local slang] or a Chinese person wants to learn, I'll teach them.\"\n\nCheck out the above video to see how he pulls off the trick.\n\nReservations are recommended.
