Mr Trump says it's a witch-hunt and he did nothing wrong.\n\nWhat could happen next?\n\nIf the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives voted to impeach Mr Trump, there'd be a trial in the Senate.\n\nCould he be removed?\n\nA Senate vote needs a two-thirds majority to convict, but Mr Trump's Republican party controls the Senate so that's unlikely. And the Mueller inquiry made clear you can't charge a sitting president with a crime.", "description": "\u201cThe president has chosen the path of defiance, obstruction, and cover-up,\u201d Democrats say.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9985/production/_109110393_057072879-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
