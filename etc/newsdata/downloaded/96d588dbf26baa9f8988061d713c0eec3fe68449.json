He\u2019s rarely without a cigarette in his mouth. \u201cI\u2019ll quit when they revoke article 50,\u201d he promises.\n\nOf the few people who could be considered to have had a \u2018good Brexit\u2019 \u2013 Hilary Benn, Adam Fleming, that pensioner who voted leave and everyone cheered \u2013 Bray is chief among them.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Another was appearing behind Chris Grayling after it emerged the then transport secretary had given Brexit contracts to a ferry company with no ferries. Bray held a model boat up to viewers. SS Disaster, it said.\n\nHis persistence has been such that when the BBC built a 15ft platform on the green \u2013 essentially to prevent him getting in shot \u2013 he responded by fashioning a 15ft pole to keep holding placards in view.\n\n\u201cI heard they spent \u00a310,000 on that platform,\u201d the grandfather-of-one says. \u201cI nipped into Screwfix and bought a couple of conduits and a pack of couplings for \u00a32.49. Job done.\u201d\n\nNot that the on-screen presenters themselves appear overly concerned, it should be said. Annita McVeigh defended his right to protest live on air, while Laura Kuenssberg and Victoria Derbyshire both tend to say hello, he reckons. Kay Burley, I ask? \u201cI get an eye-roll,\u201d he says.\n\nLater in the day a cameraman walks past on his way to a late shift. \u201cGood showing on the 10 o\u2019clock last night, Steve,\u201d he hollers over.\n\nBray these days, is just one of dozens of protestors \u2013 both for and against Brexit \u2013 who gather around College Green every day. It\u2019s a circus down there.\n\nOne woman, Elspeth Williams, had lived in Spain for almost two decades but came to London in January to campaign full time. Another tells me she split with her husband because of their differences over the referendum. \u201cWell, that and he\u2019s a dickhead,\u201d she says.\n\nYet despite the melee of flags, chants and occasional BoJo impersonators, Bray \u2013 perhaps because he was here first \u2013 remains central.\n\nI ask if he considers himself eccentric and he looks momentarily confused. \u201cNo,\u201d he replies from under his top hat, megaphone by his feet.\n\nWhatever the case, Remainers \u2013 or at least Remainists \u2013 love him.\n\nThe aforementioned Ms Williams says that when the pair marched together during last weekend\u2019s People\u2019s Vote rally, he was constantly approached by well-wishers. \u201cIt was like being with Mick Jagger,\u201d the 52-year-old translator notes.\n\nBray himself tells a story of once having an arm slung around his shoulders. \u201cMy missis fucking loves you,\u201d said its owner.\n\n\u201cIt was only Bob Geldof,\u201d he recalls. \u201cHe says: \u2018You deserve the fucking European medal\u2019. I\u2019m not sure there is a European medal but anyway: \u2018Alright, Bob, thank you\u2019.\u201d\n\nWith such star power, I venture, he might end up being offered a place on I\u2019m A Celebrity at some point.\n\n\u201cIn the jungle?\u201d he ponders. \u201cAll the Leavers would keep voting to have me eat the kangaroo testicles.\u201d\n\nThis may be true. Bray, it barely needs saying, is not beloved by everyone.\n\nThe police have placed an injunction on him to stop him using motorised loudhailers, while commentators have suggested his constant haranguing of Brexiteers may have turned some moderates towards Leave.\n\n\u201cAre you the annoying shouty man?\u201d one passer-by asks him today, before the pair don\u2019t so much debate as take it in turns to talk at each other for five minutes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll engage with most people,\u201d Bray tells me afterwards. \u201cHe was okay but you get some people, they\u2019re all \u2018two world wars and one world cup\u2019 types. I don\u2019t get involved with them.\u201d\n\nA group of what he calls far-right activists recently crushed his loudhailer. \u201cIt cost me 40 quid having it panel-beaten back,\u201d he says. \u201cMoney well spent. I call it battle-worn now.\u201d\n\nIn July, meanwhile, a clan of Tommy Robinson supporters \u2013 in central London to see their figurehead jailed for contempt of court \u2013 surrounded Bray\u2019s car and started smashing it up. He now owns a stab proof vest but tends not to wear it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no point being scared,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cYou have to keep fighting fascists.\u201d\n\nIt is all a far cry from his pre-Brexit life.\n\nBefore the 2016 referendum, he was not only politically inactive, he had no real political views. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise how much was wrong with the country,\u201d he says. \u201cThis opened my eyes.\u201d\n\nIn September 2017, he found himself so incensed by Theresa May\u2019s \u00a31 billion cash for votes deal with Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP that he drove to London to live homeless for a week in order to withhold taxes. On his last two days in the capital, he went, on a whim, to Westminster bearing Union Jack and EU flags, and stood outside for 12 hours.\n\nHe has come back \u2013 roughly 7am to 10pm \u2013 every day that parliament has sat since. Why?\n\n\u201cSocial justice,\u201d he says. \u201cSo many communities would be devastated by Brexit that we have to make a stand. I\u2019m serving my country. By being on the news every day, I\u2019m showing people who feel the same that they\u2019re not alone.\u201d\n\nNot that he ever expected to be here so long. He believed Brexit was so self-evidently foolish it would be dropped within a couple of months.\n\n\u201cHome by Christmas, I thought,\u201d he says. For a moment, he looks tired. He gets another a cigarette. \u201cIt\u2019s hard work,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s relentless.\u201d\n\nFor the first year, he lived off his savings. Since then, he says, he has been crowd-funded. Supporters contribute through his SoDEM \u2013 Stand of Defiance European Movement \u2013 webpage.\n\nHe currently lives with four other protestors in a bare flat in central London but, during 26 months down here, he has lived in 14 different places and spent the occasional night kipping in his car.\n\nAt one point, he moved into a house next door to Jacob Rees-Mogg. Seeing the MP\u2019s son waving at him one day from a window, he gave a cheerful blast of megaphone. \u201cAnd he started cheering,\u201d says Bray. \u201cMaybe the boy\u2019s a secret Remainer.\u201d\n\nHis own family is a moot point.\n\nHe is estranged from his only daughter and grandson. His parents were Leavers, and it appears to have strained that relationship too. \u201cYou know how it is with fathers,\u201d he says. \u201cAlways difficult.\u201d\n\nYet, he would not change any of this. He fell in love down here \u2013 over an EU flag \u2013 with a former BBC journalist and the couple have been together two years now. \u201cMe, who left school at 15 and her, a Cambridge graduate,\u201d he says. \u201cHow would we have ever met otherwise?\u201d\n\nMore importantly, he remains adamant he is doing the right thing.\n\nAs the day draws to a close, I ask if it is not discourteous to shout TV guests down and he appears unconcerned. \u201cThese Brexiteers are talking nonsense without being challenged,\u201d he says. \u201cI correct that.\u201d\n\nWhen I wonder if he is undermining the fundamental principle of democratic consent, he is untroubled by self-doubt. \u201cThe referendum was built on lies,\u201d he replies.\n\nHe will stay doing this now until Brexit is stopped \u2013 and if it\u2019s not stopped? \u201cI don\u2019t plan for that any more than I plan for a meteorite hitting the earth,\u201d he says.\n\nEither way, when all this is over, he plans to keep campaigning one way or another. Possibly, next, he will make the argument for proportional representation.\n\n\u201cBefore all this, my life was boring,\u201d he says. \u201cI worked alone, I had no social life, I had nothing, really. If there\u2019s one good thing to come from this whole mess, it\u2019s this community of people. Together, we can make this country a better place.\u201d", "description": "It is 11am just off Westminster\u2019s College Green and, in the 20 minutes I have been with Steve Bray, he has received half a dozen selfie requests and signed a couple of autographs. A passing police officer has discretely told him: keep up the good work. In normal times, this may be an unusual reaction to a middle-aged coin dealer from Port Talbot.", "authors": ["Colin Drury"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/02/10/07751347.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
