He ended up completing just 9 of 20 passes for 143 yards, his worst passing game so far this season. At that point, the Ravens hadn\u2019t scored an offensive touchdown. But Jackson\u2019s legs were working, as usual. His confidence was unshaken, too. He had a singular focus: to make something happen before his counterpart, Russell Wilson, did.\n\nOver the years, Jackson had seen Wilson steal too many games like this one. Not today, Jackson thought. To beat a leading MVP candidate on his turf, Jackson had to channel his own will to win.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018This time, we aren\u2019t kicking no field goal because Russell Wilson is getting the ball again, and if we didn\u2019t score, it might look ugly,\u2019\u201d Jackson said.\n\nBaltimore offensive coordinator Greg Roman called his best designed quarterback run of the day \u2014 \u201cQuarterback Power\u201d \u2014 in which Jackson would carry the ball between the tackles. It was a play that put the 212-pound Jackson enough at risk that Harbaugh warned the offense all week that it could run it \u201conly when we need it the most.\u201d Jackson took the shotgun snap, burst through the middle and into the end zone for an eight-yard score. The Ravens (5-2) controlled the rest of the game. Jackson secured a signature road victory and found a way to be spectacular even when he wasn\u2019t at his best.\n\nAD\n\nIn some ways, it was game that validated all the breakthroughs Jackson has made during his second season as much as his ridiculous statistical performances. For the first time in seven starts this season, he didn\u2019t complete at least half of his passes. Every yard came hard, but he resisted the urge to force things. On a rainy afternoon, he didn\u2019t commit a turnover. He took just one sack, which was more the result of slipping on wet turf. And he dominated the game by rushing for 71 of his 116 yards after halftime.\n\nAD\n\nJackson made every key play, including directing a nine-minute drive in the fourth quarter that resulted in a field goal. With Wilson on the other sideline, Jackson\u2019s knack for doing whatever it takes to win became even more pronounced.\n\n\u201cHe is a competitor to the nth degree,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to describe how competitive Lamar Jackson is. . . . Lamar can beat you any kind of different ways.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJackson now has an 11-3 record over the past two seasons as the Ravens\u2019 starting quarterback. We often talk about winning quarterbacks in mystical terms because some of their best qualities are intangibles. But it\u2019s not just magic. You can quantify what they do to collect wins, and in Jackson\u2019s case, he separates from his peers with his elite speed, vision while running and better-than-advertised arm talent.\n\nAD\n\nWith improved passing accuracy this season, Jackson can win using a variety of tools. Add his composure and leadership to all that physical talent, and that\u2019s why the opponent never should feel comfortable when competing against Jackson\u2019s team. This winning superpower really comes clear when watching Jackson against Wilson, who has an 80-38-1 career record and a championship on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nEven though they are both mobile, Wilson and Jackson are very different quarterbacks. Wilson is more accurate and efficient. He is a master of improvisation, and he has become the best deep-ball thrower in the NFL. Wilson can run, but Jackson can fly. It seems like Jackson has electricity in his legs. He doesn\u2019t escape from defenders; he disappears. At this point in his career, Jackson is good at creating big plays through the air, but the Baltimore passing attack lives off short throws to get him in a rhythm and stretch the defense horizontally. Wilson is looking for chunk plays at all times.\n\nAD\n\nBut at their core, they are the same in that they\u2019re willing to use any skill they possess to win a game, and even if they are playing ugly, they can do something beautiful at any moment. On Sunday, the Baltimore defense held Wilson in check, scored two touchdowns off turnovers and watched Jackson do the rest.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen you saw him in person, he\u2019s faster than we saw him on film,\u201d Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll said. \u201cHe was able to just find the space and get out of things. There really wasn\u2019t any missed tackles. He just ran around people and found a way.\u201d\n\nCarroll marveled at how the Ravens are helping Jackson develop because of their trust and desire to adapt to his special skills.\n\n\u201cI think they are doing a fantastic job with him in their offense,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cHe\u2019s totally unique, and they know it, and they\u2019ve recognized it, and they\u2019re playing ball with him.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWe\u2019re midway through the season, so Jackson isn\u2019t surprising teams with his improvement anymore. His statistics also aren\u2019t being inflated as much by his season-opening brilliance against lowly Miami, when he completed 17 of 20 passes for 324 yards and five touchdowns. He has played enough football now to cool off. He has had a three-interception game. On Sunday, he failed to complete 10 passes. Still, when you combine all the highs and lows, Jackson is putting together a Pro Bowl second season. Even better, he has the Ravens in position to build upon the success they had late last season after he took over at quarterback.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really special out there,\u201d Wilson said, smiling at Jackson\u2019s talent even as he lamented the loss.\n\nOver the years, many opponents have had to grin in defeat and say the same about Wilson. You knew he\u2019d have to return the compliment one day. Certainly, Jackson is worthy of wonderment.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Jackson took control in the biggest moments of Sunday\u2019s win against Seattle, and Baltimore\u2019s franchise quarterback is blossoming into a star.", "authors": ["Jerry Brewer", "Sports Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/HpkyBdA1hqxjAKeNtFnbnvOrAz4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FZWQJQXTXYI6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
