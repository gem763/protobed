The reason is to avoid any further public speculation and unnecessary remarks accusing the police.\"\n\nOne officer told reporters last week that some officers had overstepped the line when dealing with protesters.\n\n\"You are talking about a prolonged situation, chaos, violent encounters,\" he said. \"We have established procedures to deal with allegations of abuse of force. Every day, with every chance we have, we remind our officers not to succumb to emotions.\n\n\"We've gone through multiple situations where lethal force would have been justified, but our officers chose not to use it.\"\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam, in the first \"open dialogue\" session with the people on Thursday, said she would not accede to protesters' demands for an independent inquiry into police action. She did not explain why.\n\nThis weekend, the Asian financial hub marks the fifth anniversary of the start of the \"Umbrella\" protests, a series of pro-democracy demonstrations in 2014 that failed to wrest concessions from Beijing.\n\nThousands of people are expected to rally in the city centre on Saturday evening. Protests are also expected on Sunday to mark Global Anti-Totalitarianism Day, with solidarity events planned in cities across the world, including Paris, Berlin, Taipei, New York, Kiev and London.\n\nBut the biggest protests are likely to be on Oct 1, marking the anniversary of the proclamation of the People's Republic of China in 1949, with protesters saying they plan to use the holiday to propel calls for greater democracy.\n\nActivists plan a mass rally from Victoria Park in the bustling Causeway Bay district to Chater Garden near government headquarters.\n\nOfficial festivities for National Day have been scaled back, with authorities keen to avoid embarrassing Beijing at a time when President Xi Jinping is seeking to project an image of national strength and unity.\n\nPro-Beijing rallies are also planned in the city, raising the prospect of clashes.\n\nThe protests were sparked in June by a bill, since withdrawn, that would have allowed extradition of suspected criminals to mainland China but have since expanded into a broader pro-democracy movement.\n\nProtesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997 under a \"one country, two systems\" formula intended to guarantee freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\nChina denies meddling. It has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of inciting the unrest.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [HONG KONG] Thousands of Hong Kong protesters rallied at the harbour side on Friday, chanting slogans accusing the police of brutality and setting the stage for a weekend of demonstrations leading up to the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China. .
