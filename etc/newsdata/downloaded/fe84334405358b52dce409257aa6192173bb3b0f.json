That\u2019s the step that launches the formal campaign.\n\nThe election is scheduled for Oct. 21. Candidates have spent the summer stumping informally but will now have to follow different rules around campaign spending and advertising.\n\nAfter sailing through much of Trudeau\u2019s first term, the Liberals have fallen back this year into a close race with Andrew Scheer\u2019s opposition Conservative Party and face an uphill battle to hold onto their parliamentary majority. In Canada, minority governments rarely last longer than 18 months.\n\nTrudeau, whose father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, was one of Canada\u2019s longest-serving prime ministers, overcame charges of inexperience four years ago to orchestrate a come-from-behind victory over Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper and become an international sensation.\n\nHe promised \u201csunny ways,\u201d transparency, growth for the middle class, more women in positions of authority and reconciliation with Canada\u2019s indigenous groups. His government legalized recreational cannabis and medically assisted dying, imposed a nationwide price on carbon and expanded parental benefits.\n\nCanada\u2019s unemployment rate this year reached a 40-year low; GDP growth in the most recent quarter was announced at a better-than-expected 3.7 percent.\n\n[Canada\u2019s Trudeau is down in the polls. Can Conservatives take advantage?]\n\nBut Trudeau also suffered several wounds \u2014 many of them self-inflicted. He was ridiculed for a diplomatically awkward trip to India and was rebuked by Canada\u2019s ethics watchdog for a family vacation that broke conflict-of-interest laws. His government has weathered a turbulent relationship with President Trump and has found itself embroiled in diplomatic disputes with Saudi Arabia, the Philippines and China.\n\nIn February, allegations surfaced that Trudeau and senior government officials had inappropriately pressured Jody Wilson-Raybould, the country\u2019s attorney general, to reach an out-of-court settlement with SNC-Lavalin, an engineering firm in Trudeau\u2019s home province of Quebec charged with bribery and corruption.\n\nIn nationally televised parliamentary hearings, Wilson-Raybould accused government officials of making \u201cveiled threats\u201d and demoting her when she refused to succumb to the pressure.\n\nThe allegations set off a political firestorm and triggered several high-profile resignations from government. Having sold Canadians on running a government beyond reproach that would be open to diverse views, Trudeau stood accused of shady backroom dealings and judicial interference, of being a fake feminist, and of bullying Wilson-Raybould, an indigenous woman.\n\nTrudeau has not apologized. He has said he was trying to protect Canadian jobs. A conviction would lead to a decade-long ban on federal contracts for SNC-Lavalin.\n\nSupport for the Liberals cratered. The party had only recently begun to recover in the polls when the ethics watchdog ruled last month that Trudeau once again broke conflict-of-interest laws in the affair, and used his authority \u201cto circumvent, undermine and ultimately attempt to discredit\u201d Wilson-Raybould.\n\n[Justin Trudeau rapped a second time for conflicts of interest]\n\nIt\u2019s unusual for the race to be so tight because Canadians have a long history of giving prime ministers who enjoy ruling majorities a second mandate.\n\n\u201cJustin Trudeau is a defined quality now, and his greatest strength is his greatest weakness,\u201d said pollster Shachi Kurl, executive director of the Angus Reid Institute. \u201cHe\u2019s got to change the channel and turn up the volume and talk about the issues because talking about his brand is a liability.\u201d\n\nThe Conservatives, led by Scheer, a 40-year-old pro-Brexit former insurance broker, pose the main threat to Trudeau.\n\nScheer, who edged out Conservative rivals to win the party leadership in 2017, remains little known outside of politics. Richard Johnston, a political scientist at the University of British Columbia, said that could allow rivals \u201cto write the story of Andrew Scheer before he can do it himself\u201d and \u201cpin reactionary positions on him.\u201d\n\nScheer has cast himself as a moderate. He has pledged to balance the federal budget within five years, scrap Trudeau\u2019s federal carbon tax for a cap on carbon for large emitters, and increase federal transfers to the provinces for health care and social programs.\n\nCanada\u2019s two left-of-Liberal parties, Jagmeet Singh\u2019s New Democrats and Elizabeth May\u2019s Green Party, trail the Liberals and the Conservatives. But they could play kingmaker if the election produces a minority government, as several polls predict.\n\nSingh said last month he would not prop up a Conservative government, after the Liberals resurfaced a video from 2005 in which Scheer argued against the bill that would legalize same-sex marriage in the House of Commons. Scheer maintains he won\u2019t change the law, but he has not marched in a Pride parade as his political rivals have or indicated whether his views on the issue have changed.\n\n[Months before Canada\u2019s election, Justin Trudeau\u2019s colorful mother takes the stage to tell all]\n\nWith a volatile electorate, analysts say, the answers to two questions will shape the election\u2019s outcome: Will the progressive vote eventually coalesce around one leader as it did for Trudeau in 2015? Who will turn out to vote?\n\n\u201cCanadian politics now is one in which there is a bigger progressive vote than there is a conservative vote,\u201d said Darrell Bricker, chief executive of the polling firm Ipsos Public Affairs. \u201cBut the difference between the progressive vote and the conservative vote is that the conservative vote is not divided. On the progressive side, the vote is fragmenting.\u201d\n\nKurl said that the Conservatives benefit from a \u201cvery committed and motivated\u201d base that \u201cwould vote three times for Andrew Scheer if it was allowed,\u201d while progressive voters appear less energized.\n\nMuch will depend on who will win the ethnically diverse middle-class suburban constituencies outside Toronto and Vancouver \u2014 critical districts where elections are won and lost. In Ontario, a key battleground, the Conservatives trail the Liberals, in part because of the unpopularity of Progressive Conservative Premier Doug Ford.\n\nCanada\u2019s foreign signals intelligence agency said this year it was \u201cvery likely that Canadian voters will encounter some form of foreign cyber interference\u201d ahead of and during the federal election. The Communications Signals Establishment added that it was \u201cimprobable\u201d the interference would reach the scale of Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe government said it was establishing a panel of impartial senior bureaucrats to monitor attempts at interference. The panel may decide whether an incident is serious enough to warrant informing political parties and the public. It will not need the approval of lawmakers before sounding the alarm.\n\nRead more:\n\nJustin Trudeau loves apologies.
