Calhoun, current independent lead director, to serve as non-executive chairman, the company statement said.\n\n\u201cThe board has full confidence in Dennis as CEO and believes this division of labor will enable maximum focus on running the business with the board playing an active oversight role,\u201d Calhoun said in the statement. \u201c\n\nThe shift comes as Boeing faces numerous probes and backlash over two fatal 737 Max planes crashes within six months of each other. One crashed in October 2018 in Indonesia shortly after takeoff, killing all 189 aboard. The other killed all 157 aboard when it crashed in March, shortly after takeoff in Ethiopia.\n\nAfter the second crash, the Federal Aviation Administration grounded the Boeing 737 Max aircraft.\n\nInvestigations have shown faulty angle-of-attack sensors pushed both planes into a nose dive when they fed erroneous data to the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System.\n\nIn April, the FAA launched a task force with NASA, called the Joint Authorities Technical Review team, to analyze Boeing\u2019s fix for its MCAS.\n\nOn Friday, the JATR releases its report on findings and recommendations.\n\n\u201cThe JATR team found that the MCAS was not evaluated as a complete and integrated function in the certification documents that were submitted to the FAA,\u201d the report stated. \u201cThe lack of a unified top-down development and evaluation of the system function and its safety analyses, combined with the extensive and fragmented documentation, made it difficult to assess whether compliance was fully demonstrated.\u201d\n\nThe JATR recommended the FAA conduct a workforce review of the Boeing Aviation Safety Oversight Office engineer staffing level to ensure sufficient numbers for adequate performance.\n\nLast month, the FAA ordered inspections on another type of Boeing 737 \u2014 the NG model \u2014 due to structural cracks.", "description": "Oct. 12 (UPI) \u2014 Boeing removed CEO Dennis Muilenburg as chairman of the board, the company said, to give him time to focus on operations amid the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
