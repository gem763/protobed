At a time when India is trying to diplomatically isolate Pakistan, MBS offering Islamabad $20 billion in investment was jarring for New Delhi. However, Saudi-Pakistani ties have a history that cannot be wished away. On the other hand, it\u2019s welcome that Riyadh under MBS\u2019s leadership is looking to diversify its strategic engagements and sees New Delhi as a reliable partner.\n\nWhile one positive from MBS\u2019s visit was that he offered New Delhi intelligence sharing and cooperation, overall he took the relatively anodyne position that terrorism and extremism are common concerns. Meanwhile, Modi emphasised that the two countries had agreed that terrorism would not be supported in any form and that pressure should be brought on countries that back terror. Although there was no mention of Pakistan by the two leaders, this is the closest that the joint statement got to sending a message to Islamabad.\n\nIf there\u2019s one country with even more influence in Pakistan than China, it\u2019s Saudi Arabia. And the Saudis do not have an interest in containing India the same way that China has. The best case scenario would be if Riyadh could privately persuade the Pakistanis to give up the terror tool \u2013 in which case Riyadh\u2019s refraining from public criticism would yield fruit. In the meantime, bilateral cooperation on other fronts should move apace. It\u2019s welcome that New Delhi and Riyadh inked five agreements during this visit, including MoUs on Saudi investment in the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund, tourism cooperation and broadcasting.\n\nMissing was the deal to set up a refinery in Ratnagiri, Maharashtra. Saudi Aramco and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co together were supposed to have 50% stake in the $44 billion project. However, it has been hit by farmer and political protests, forcing the Maharashtra government to announce a shift in its location. In fact, land acquisition issues continue to stymie several foreign investments. Easing land acquisition and managing it better must be part of India\u2019s economic strategy. The stronger India\u2019s economy is, and the greater the stake other countries have in it, the more will foreign leaders heed India\u2019s concerns.", "description": "With Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s (MBS) visit to India coming on the heels of his visit to Pakistan and the Pulwama terror attack carried out by Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Muhammed, one surmises that...", "authors": ["Toi Edit"], "top_image": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/toiedit-logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-21"}
