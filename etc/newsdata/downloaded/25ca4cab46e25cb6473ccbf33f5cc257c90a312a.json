(Image: Sony Pictures)\n\nFans who sit down to watch Spider-Man: Far From Home on Blu-ray may encounter a new surprise. After the film\u2019s final, Nick Fury-centric end credits tag, things continue. Really. The disc just quietly just rolls from the movie into the first of many extra features, but anyone who isn\u2019t paying attention may be very confused when new footage comes on and continues for more than an hour.\n\nThankfully, the Spider-Man: Far From Home Blu-ray will make you want to pay attention. In addition to the obviously excellent Spider-Man movie, there\u2019s almost an hour and a half of bonus features that run the gamut from stupid and superfluous to fascinating and essential.\n\nCollectively, they touch on lots of details that will make Far From Home fans appreciate the Marvel/Sony film even more.\n\nThe main event of the features is called \u201cPeter\u2019s To-Do List,\u201d and it\u2019s the three-plus minute \u201cshort film\u201d that starts immediately after the credits of the main movie (all of these are also just accessible from the main menu too).\n\nThe \u201cshort film\u201d really isn\u2019t a short film though. It\u2019s a sequence of scenes that were deleted, as per director Jon Watts, because the movie was too slow at the beginning. And while the semantics describing the scene aren\u2019t quite right, the scene on its own is enjoyable, showing Peter do a few random things like sell He-Man and Thundercats (but not Star Wars) action figures to get money for his trip. That scene would have felt right at home in the six minutes of deleted and alternate scenes that are also on the disc.\n\nThere\u2019s another that explains what the students and teachers were doing at the rest stop where Peter gets the Night Monkey suit, more of Jake Gyllenhaal preparing his evil plans, a nice moment with Aunt May from the very end of the film, lots more Flash Thompson, and \u2014 best of all \u2014 footage showing the high school morning hosts, Betty and Jason, \u201cblip\u201d and return live on their show five years later. It doesn\u2019t make sense the way the film is edited now but it\u2019s a fun addition.\n\nSpeaking of fun, there are over three and a half minutes of outtakes and bloopers. These are always entertaining but the highlight here is just seeing the wild chemistry and budding friendship between Tom Holland and Jake Gyllenhaal. The two make each other laugh a lot and it\u2019s excellent to watch. Here\u2019s a taste:\n\nMaybe the weirdest thing on the entire release is a five-minute piece called \u201cTeacher\u2019s Travel Tips.\u201d Edited and made like a high school student film, this odd clip mostly features J.B. Smoove and Martin Starr improvising a bunch of teacher stuff intercut with bad graphics. It\u2019s funny but mostly just really, really awkward.\n\nAt this point, you may think this is already a pretty good selection of special features. And it is. But we haven\u2019t gotten to the best stuff yet.\n\nIn addition to all of that, there are also 11 featurettes, each ranging from a minute and a half to about eight minutes, exploring all aspects of Far From Home, from its story, to its casting, the production, and more.\n\nThere are segments on the stunts (which were way more practical than you\u2019d imagine), all the new Spider-Man costumes, the location shooting, all the film\u2019s Easter eggs (which is less exciting than it sounds, unfortunately), Mysterio, Aunt May and more.\n\nInterviews with Holland, Watts, Gyllenhaal, Samuel L. Jackson, basically everyone in the film, give all of these videos a real authority and show the high level of craftsmanship and passion that went into the movie. Then, just to put a cherry on top, there\u2019s a feature where you can watch the film\u2019s major action sequences in their original pre-viz version in a split-screen with the final film. Super cool stuff.\n\nOur favourite piece, though, is a segment called \u201cThe Ginter Riva Effect.\u201d This short but sweet featurette is about the fact Peter Billingsley came back to reprise his role from Iron Man (that of William Ginter Riva) in Far From Home, and that the production reshot sequences from the first Iron Man for the montage. That was not something we expected or knew about, even with all that\u2019s been written about the film.\n\nFinally, if you made it through all that, obviously you\u2019re a Spider-Man fan. So Sony also added an almost 12-minute feature called \u201cThe Brothers Trust.\u201d The Brothers\u2019 Trust is an organisation set up by Tom Holland\u2019s family (which includes himself and his three brothers) to raise awareness and money for worthy charities. So this video, which is not Spider-Man specific but is still related and touching, adds a little heart to the release.\n\nAll in all, it\u2019ll take you around an hour and a half to get through all the Spider-Man: Far From Home special features, and during that time you\u2019re going to learn a lot about what went into making the movie. That, plus the awesome movie itself, make Far From Home a more than worthy addition to your home theatre collection.\n\nSpider-Man: Far From Home is available on digital and Blu-ray on October 23.", "description": "Fans who sit down to watch Spider-Man: Far From Home on Blu-ray may encounter a new surprise.
