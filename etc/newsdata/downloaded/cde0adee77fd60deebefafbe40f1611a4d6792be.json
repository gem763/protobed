Mitt Romney (R-Utah) with reporters at the Capitol on Tuesday. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nSen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told CNN: \"I\u2019m not planning on endorsing in the presidential race. At this stage, I\u2019m not planning on endorsing in the primary or in the general.\u201d In response to the decision by several states to cancel their primaries, he would only say, \u201cI would far prefer having an open primary, caucus, convention process . . . where people can be heard.\u201d Prefer?\n\nReally, he can do better than that. He\u2019s not on the ballot for another five years, and this is a simple issue: Does the Republican Party believe in democracy or not? That is not a question of \u201cpreference\u201d but of fundamental principle, one that the sheep in the GOP have kicked to the curb in the interest of staying on President Trump\u2019s good side.\n\nRomney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, has occasionally broken with Trump. For example, he was in favor of nixing the emergency declaration to build Trump\u2019s wall; he voted against a judicial appointee who slurred President Barack Obama; and let it be known that he opposed Herman Cain\u2019s appointment to the Federal Reserve Board. When Trump told four nonwhite congresswomen to \u201cgo back\u201d to the countries from which they came, Romney tweeted, \u201cPeople can disagree over politics and policy, but telling American citizens to go back to where they came from is over the line.\u201d At least he said something.\n\n[Sign up to receive Opinions pieces in your inbox six days a week]\n\nHowever, Romney has neither forcefully nor consistently condemned the president\u2019s racist outbursts \u2014 or his lying, his erratic foreign policy, or his aggregation of executive power. The senator bemoaned the firing of national security adviser John Bolton but did not condemn the Camp David invitation to the Taliban. And, worst of all, he has not deplored the president\u2019s self-dealing or receipt of emoluments.\n\nRomney would seem to be in the perfect position to defend the most basic principles of government. Do not use your office to make money. Do not tell government officials to lie. Do not gleefully accept money from foreign states. It is here that Romney, could, if he wanted to, push his party to stop turning a blind eye to Trump\u2019s corruption.\n\nUnfortunately, when presented with robust evidence of wrongdoing, Romney has not been inclined to stand up to Trump. When presented with the Mueller report, Romney pronounced himself \u201csickened at the extent and pervasiveness of dishonesty and misdirection by individuals in the highest office of the land, including the President.\u201d He also declared he was \u201cappalled that, among other things, fellow citizens working in a campaign for president welcomed help from Russia.\u201d And yet, with all that, he would not declare Trump unfit for office and insisted there was no evidence of obstruction of justice, despite 10 categories of obstruction detailed in the special counsel\u2019s report.\n\nIf he is hoarding his political capital, it is difficult to tell when and on what he might spend some of it. If he cannot tell the American people that it is unacceptable for a president to steer business toward his own businesses, welcome foreign money, allow his children to feather their own businesses and to lie incessantly, it\u2019s hard to figure out why he ran for the Senate in the first place. Any old Republican could have filled Orrin Hatch\u2019s seat. Romney didn\u2019t need to leave his large family and disturb his retirement only to go to Washington to see Trump turn the presidency into a tin-pot dictator\u2019s personal piggy bank.\n\nRead more:\n\nEd Rogers: Republicans are canceling primaries.
