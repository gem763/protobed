Rather, Joseph Maguire, a retired Navy SEAL vice admiral and now the acting intelligence chief, is described by friends and colleagues as a politically astute extrovert with a renowned sense of humor.\n\n\u201cHe many times referred to himself as the \u2018baby kisser\u2019 or as the political head of the organization,\u201d said a longtime acquaintance of Maguire, who hails from Brooklyn, N.Y. \u201cHe wants to be the New York mayor. A lot of people know that\u2019s his ambition. ... He has said that openly.\u201d\n\nFor now, however, Maguire is the acting director of national intelligence, and his political skills are being put to the test. When he showed up for work on Aug. 16, his first day in his new position, he was almost immediately presented with a political hand grenade in the form of a whistleblower complaint passed on from the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general, Michael Atkinson.\n\nJoseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence.

Scott Applewhite/AP) More\n\nThat complaint is now at the center of Democrats\u2019 call for an impeachment inquiry.\n\nAccording to the Department of Justice, the complaint relates to \u201ca confidential diplomatic communication between the President and a foreign leader,\u201d reportedly President Trump and recently elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, although multiple news outlets have reported the subject of the complaint is wider than a single phone call.\n\nThe law requires the director of national intelligence to immediately share with Congress whistleblower complaints deemed an \u201curgent\u201d concern. But acting on the advice of lawyers from his own office and from the Department of Justice, Maguire for days refused to do so on the grounds that the complaint was not directly related to intelligence matters. On Wednesday afternoon, the complaint was finally delivered to Congress, where House and Senate Intelligence Committee members are reviewing it.\n\nThat refusal unleashed an onslaught of criticism from senior Democratic politicians and transparency advocates. The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., has subpoenaed Maguire to testify before the panel, telling reporters that Maguire had made the \u201cunprecedented decision not to share the complaint with Congress.\u201d In the days since Schiff made the dispute public Sept. 13 by revealing that Maguire was withholding the complaint, the controversy has blossomed into an impeachment inquiry that threatens to bring down Trump.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff.

Those circumstances have earned him the sympathy of Dan Coats, the man he replaced in an acting capacity as director of national intelligence.\n\n\u201cI feel so bad for Joe,\u201d Coats told the Economic Club of Indiana on Tuesday, according to the Indianapolis Star. \u201cHe is caught in a squeeze here and the lawyers are divided.\u201d\n\nMaguire will have an opportunity to explain his position Thursday, when he is scheduled to appear before the House Intelligence Committee. The Washington Post reported Wednesday that Maguire threatened to resign if the White House tried to prevent him from speaking freely to Congress. He quickly issued a denial. \u201cAt no time have I considered resigning my position,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI have never quit anything in my life, and I am not going to start now.\u201d", "description": "Maguire\u2019s statement tracks with what his staff is saying, according to a former senior national security official. Maguire is \u201csomeone on whose integrity I would stake my life,\u201d said the former senior national security official.", "authors": ["Sean D.
