I don\u2019t know, maybe it is because his wife works in the office of the president and people are scared of him,\u201d said Sonteni.\n\nAnother resident, Khanyisa Ngqwala, said the main problem was that the chief chose to close the road unilaterally without their consent as villagers.\n\nMaliviwe Gubelana alleged that a housing project came to a standstill because the chief chased away one of the project managers, saying they were being disrespectful by wearing short pants during a meeting at the royal residence.\n\nIt means I cannot go there to seek refuge if a man is attacking me or I have been raped. I have to go home first and put on a dress, otherwise I will not be allowed at the royal residence\n\nPretty Sogoni said the White Door centre was becoming a white elephant because most people in the village did not use it.\n\n\u201cFor instance, as a woman you cannot visit the centre wearing trousers. It means I cannot go there to seek refuge if a man is attacking me or I have been raped. I have to go home first and put on a dress, otherwise I will not be allowed at the royal residence,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Dikos could see that this was going to affect the ANC, they opened the road and waited for elections to be over\n\nBaxolile Nodada, DA MP in the National Assembly, visited the village last week to get a first-hand account of the villagers\u2019 grievances.\n\nNodada, who is also the constituency leader of the DA in the Alfred Nzo District Municipality, said he had written to Diko to hear his side of the story.\n\nHe said the opposition party was planning to take the matter to court.\n\n\u201cThe road was opened two days before the elections because the community threatened to not vote, and closed two days after elections. Because it\u2019s a political issue and the Dikos could see that this was going to affect the ANC, they opened the road and waited for elections to be over and closed it again after people had voted.\n\n\u201cThis shows there was absolutely no reason for the road to be closed in the first place,\u201d said Nodada.\n\nHe said the DA would raise the matter with the South African Human Rights Commission.\n\nNodada claimed that President Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s spokesperson, Khusela Diko, was aware of the situation.\n\n\u201cKhusela is aware of this thing. I mean, she is married to the guy, they stay together there. I met her (last Thursday) in Parliament. She is aware,\u201d said Nodada.\n\nBut Khusela denied ever meeting Nodada.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who Baxolile Nodada is and I am not aware of any conversation with him, informal or otherwise.\u201d\n\nNokhanyo Zembe, spokesperson of Umzimvubu Local Municipality, confirmed knowledge of the matter concerning the road closure.\n\n\u201cYes, the community did report the matter to the municipality. We have had engagements with the chief at the political level of the municipality. Both executive mayors at local and district level have tried to talk with the chief so that the road can be opened.\n\n\u201cBut all those engagements failed because the chief said he would not open the road because, according to him, the road was on land belonging to his family. He then informed us that he was going to take the matter to court,\u201d said Zembe.\n\nShe confirmed that the road in question was on the municipality\u2019s map and an access road.\n\nNkosi Mwelo Nonkonyana, chairman of the Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders, said the matter had been raised with him.\n\n\u201cI can confirm that the community did write a letter to me. I know that Nkosi Diko is the leader of the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa in that region.\n\n\u201cI appealed to him to assist us to resolve that issue. He promised to come back to me. I hope we are going to solve that particular matter sooner rather than later,\u201d Nonkonyana said.\n\nDiko said he was not a chief (iNkosi), but the king of AmaBhaca.\n\nHe did not understand why people would say he was ruling through fear, that they were afraid of him or that he was abusing his power.\n\nThis thing that people are afraid of me because my wife works closely with the president is just ridiculous\n\n\u201cI am not above the law, because the law applies to anyone and everyone. It\u2019s not true that the municipality and the police were afraid to act against me.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis thing that people are afraid of me because my wife works closely with the president is just ridiculous, because the law is the law, no matter how much proximity you have to the president, or even if you are the president yourself. The law is the law,\u201d he said.\n\nDiko said the KwaBhaca Traditional Council resolved at a meeting in 2010 that the road be rerouted and diverted, not closed.\n\nThis was to be done as part of development and making the road closer to the community by rerouting it so that people could easily access it through public transport.\n\nHe said the decision of the traditional council to reroute the road was binding to everyone, including himself, and could not be changed by a few individuals in the village who had been waiting for eight years since the decision about the road had been made.\n\nDiko disputed claims by the municipality that he said he would take them to court over the road.\n\nHe also refuted claims that he chased people from the royal centre.", "description": "Residents of an Eastern Cape village are unhappy about their chief closing one of Ncunteni\u2019s main roads, but he insists it was a traditional council\u2019s decision to reroute it.", "authors": ["Lubabalo Ngcukana"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7855/7903a1defce448308d7aa9e7ecd9b38b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
