The former official said that Giuliani should have \u201cnothing to do with any of this stuff\u201d and that his involvement in pursuing a corruption investigation \u201cmakes it inherently political rather than official law enforcement.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Giuliani who\u2019s really dragged the president into something that\u2019s a legal matter and a political matter and will be part of impeachment,\u201d the former official said. \u201cWhat Giuliani did, there\u2019s no argument that it was a legitimate, government, law enforcement endeavor.\u201d\n\nYet Trump, who is often quick to abandon even his most loyal allies when it becomes politically expedient, was notably supportive of Giuliani when asked about him during a meeting with Ukraine\u2019s president on Wednesday. He even praised Giuliani\u2019s recent appearances on television.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nbcnews.Com Politics Trump-Impeachment-Inquiry"], "top_image": ""}
