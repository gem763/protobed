Romney had supported the war at the time of that trip, in 1965. But by 1967, he was against it\u2014pretty impressively early, and well ahead of public opinion.\n\nAt the time, Romney had a reputation as a flip-flopper, so the interviewer, from a Detroit news station, asked him if he hadn\u2019t flip-flopped on Vietnam. That was when Romney uttered the line that he\u2019d been given a \u201cbrainwashing\u201d by U.S. generals. That one word\u2014resonant in a culture that at the time was marinating in Cold War, Manchurian Candidate-esque paranoia\u2014ended his career.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. While the standard historical interpretation of Romney\u2019s remark has been to mark it as one of the great political gaffes of all time, the fact is that about the Vietnam War, he was right. The war was a moral and tactical disaster. And he was way ahead of the Republican base. He sabotaged his own political future, but he told the truth.", "description": "History is grabbing Romney by the lapels and screaming at him: Choose!
