He wants to throw himself into deep water and he feels like it will only be true if he\u2019s drowning.\n\nThe pair star in The Lighthouse\n\n\u2018For me that seemed wacky. But I\u2019m not trying to judge. He has a good sense of the visual, of what\u2019s needed in a close-up. Sometimes he\u2019d beat himself up so bad. He\u2019d stick his fingers down his throat, things like that.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobert had previously opened up on what he put himself through in order to personify Ephrain, who slowly descended into madness after mundane task, after mundane task in the Lighthouse.\n\nCarrying out chores such as cleaning, scrubbing floors and carrying coal, living on the remote island affects the apprentice as he begins murdering seagulls and screaming about wanting steak.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nIt\u2019s a trip.\n\nEarlier this month, the recently-announced Batman actor revealed more than we could ever imagine as he described \u2018playing a mad person\u2019.\n\n\u2018It means you can sort of be mad the whole time. Well, not the whole time, but for like an hour before the scene,\u2019 he explained to Esquire magazine.\n\nGoing further to give the people what they want, Robert said he was \u2018basically unconscious the whole time\u2019 while filming moments his character is drunk off kerosene, which seems like an easy day on the job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It was crazy,\u2019 Robert went on. \u2018I spent so much time making myself throw up. Pissing my pants. It\u2019s the most revolting thing. I don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s really annoying.\u2019\n\nMaybe.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all urinating on himself and throwing up, though, as he added he also spent time spinning around in circles before takes to really get into the mad man mentality, while also putting rocks in his shoes \u2013 which is enough to send anyone around the bend.\n\nThe Lighthouse is in UK cinemas 31 January, 2020.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
