If that had been an older person they may not be robust enough to fight the infection as I have, it could have been worse.\n\n\"To be fobbed off the way I was is just not right, I won't be staying with Premier Inn again after this.\"\n\n(Image: Google Maps, copyright unknown)\n\nA Premier Inn spokesman said: \"To ensure that we are proactive in matters of this nature, our housekeeping and maintenance teams are fully trained to spot the signs of bed bugs.\n\n\"In this instance, upon receiving the complaint our specially-trained team members examined the room and their stringent checks revealed no evidence of bed bugs.\n\n\"Nonetheless, in the interests of caution, the team have since engaged with external specialists to launch their own inspection of the guest's room and they have independently confirmed that there is absolutely no evidence of bed bugs in the room Mrs Adams' was allocated.\"", "description": "Lisa Adams, who stayed at the Premier Inn in Priory Marina, Bedford, said she felt like her blood was \"boiling\" inside her after her stay", "authors": ["Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Kennedy News", "Media", "Google Maps", "Copyright Unknown"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20705982.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Kennedy-News-and-Media.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
