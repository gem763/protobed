According to the report, Trump also directed vice-president Mike Pence to cancel travel to Ukraine to attend Zelenskiy\u2019s inauguration in May and \u201cmade clear\u201d to other officials he did not want to meet with Zelenskiy until he saw how the Ukrainian president chose to act in office. Zelenskiy has been eager to meet one-on-one with Trump and this week invited Trump to Ukraine for what would be the first visit by a US president to the country since 2008.\n\nUS diplomats charged with aiding Ukraine\u2019s reform process and facilitating negotiations over the conflict with Russia were also sucked in. The whistleblower reported that Kurt Volker, a special envoy to Ukraine, as well as US ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, met with Zelenskiy and other Ukrainian political figures the day after the call to help them \u201cnavigate\u201d the demands made by Trump. Volker has been a key intermediary between Ukraine and Russia in managing the conflict in eastern Ukraine and his work has largely risen above partisan politics to focus on peace and security issues.\n\nThe report also sheds more light on Giuliani\u2019s lobbying efforts in Ukraine, including his attempts to reach not only Zelenskiy and Ukrainian diplomats, but also officials like the chief of staff, Andiry Bohdan, and the acting chairman of the Security Service of Ukraine, Ivan Bakanov, both of whom are longtime confidants of the Ukrainian president. In the whistleblower complaint, Giuiliani\u2019s meeting with Zelenskiy aide Andriy Yermak was described as a \u201cdirect follow-up\u201d to Trump\u2019s call with Zelenskiy.", "description": "Joseph Maguire, acting director of national intelligence, testifies before the House intelligence committee on the whistleblower complaint", "authors": ["Joan E Greve", "Andrew Roth", "Corey Brettschneider"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fe2036e191982dd6e215b8db35d84035942849c/0_396_4267_2559/master/4267.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a8f3e1c530cdded909a293a6a7b923bf", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
