I don\u2019t want to have bad people have guns. But we\u2019re going to do nothing to hurt the Second Amendment,\u201d Trump said in an interview with Fox News aired Thursday.\n\nThe president\u2019s comments come as Attorney General William Barr is circulating a proposal that would expand background checks for gun buyers.\n\nWhite House officials say Trump still hasn\u2019t made a decision on what steps he\u2019d back.\n\nIn the Fox interview, Trump blamed Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s unabashed \u201chell, yes\u201d about a mandatory assault weapons buyback for making it more difficult to reach a deal.\n\n\u201cPart of the problem that we have is because of Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s statement, about taking away guns,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of the -- a lot of Republicans, and some Democrats, now are afraid to do anything to go down that slippery slope. A lot of people think this is just a way of taking away guns. And that\u2019s not good, because we\u2019re not going to allow that.\u201d\n\nTrump in the past has publicly stated support for expanded background checks. But he\u2019s shifted his position, most recently expressing doubt about whether they would be effective in curbing gun violence.\n\nHe also has threatened to veto a House bill that would extend background checks to sales between individuals.\n\nThe proposal being circulated includes requiring background checks for all commercial guns sales, including at gun shows, according to a copy of the document obtained by Bloomberg.\n\nThe idea was dismissed by the National Rifle Association\u2019s lobbying arm as a \u201cnon-starter\u201d in a tweet that said it would burden gun owners without addressing mental health issues and \u201cthe prosecution of violent criminals.\u201d\n\nNegotiations on potential new firearms restrictions spurred by mass shootings last month in Texas and Ohio have been stymied while Republicans look to the White House for any idea of what the president would sign.\n\n--With assistance from Erik Wasson, Laura Litvan and Steven T.
