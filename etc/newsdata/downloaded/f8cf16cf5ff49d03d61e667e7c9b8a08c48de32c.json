This resolute 2-1 victory away to Chelsea brought another win to make three in a row, another two goals for the suddenly revitalised Marcus Rashford, another confidence boost and just a general sense of progress beyond that in the League Cup. The striker has even started to score penalties.\n\nThe manner of both goals reflected that sense of progress, in fact, as Rashford also finally scored a free-kick.\n\nMany might argue that it\u2019s the League Cup so didn\u2019t really matter, something that was itself reflected by Frank Lampard\u2019s more experimental team.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

It was about the wider context, which was why this was a win of certain consequence.\n\nIt certainly felt like a performance of consequence for Rashford.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The Norwegian was not impressed.\n\nThat is actually exactly what he has been asking United players not to do, as he has been demanding a \u201cdevastating directness\u201d, and the type of speed that makes it impossible for opposition sides to deal with.\n\nAppropriately enough, it didn\u2019t take too long for that message to sink in.\n\nOn 24 minutes, James perfectly displayed this directness, and essentially invited a clumsy lunge from Marcos Alonso.\n\nThere was some doubt about whether it was actually a foul, but no doubt that this was a proper pressure moment for Rashford. That wasn\u2019t do with the fixture, but so many recent fixtures, given the impact of what would have been his personal third miss of the season and United\u2019s fifth.\n\nExcept there was no miss.\n\nRashford held his nerve, and sent Willy Caballero the wrong way.\n\nThe game only looked like it was going one way at that point, as it had completely settled into a predictable rhythm: a more lightweight Chelsea looking nice but largely ineffective, a stronger United looking to counter-attack.\n\nLampard surprisingly didn\u2019t change anything at half-time, but something did change about Chelsea. There was more impetus to their play, more impact.\n\nThey were beginning to force holes in United\u2019s backline, especially against a somewhat undercooked Harry Maguire. It wasn\u2019t long until an increasingly dangerous-looking Batshuayi was bursting through the defence and slamming the ball past Sergio Romero for the equaliser.\n\nOne of the more influential players in that was young Billy Gilmour, who again offered hugely exciting touches and play. He gave Fred the run-around in the first half, and helped Chelsea greatly increase their pace in the second.\n\nSomewhat inevitably for an 18-year-old, he himself wasn\u2019t going to be able to maintain the intensity in a game of this level, and was hauled off for Mason Mount.\n\nUnited, however, maintained the same game plan. Sit tight and the chances would come.\n\nGiven Rashford has a far worse relative record with free-kicks than he does with penalties, few would thought his step-up on 73 minutes was a chance at all.\n\nIt was instead the most glorious of goals, as Rashford powered a dipping strike into the top corner of the net.\n\nCaballero\u2019s despairing dive only made it all the more spectacular, adding that bit of depth to the aesthetics.\n\nUnited \u2013 and Rashford \u2013 have added that bit more confidence.", "description": "Manchester United move on to the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup and \u2013 without getting too far ahead of ourselves \u2013 there is a slight sense of it starting to come together.
