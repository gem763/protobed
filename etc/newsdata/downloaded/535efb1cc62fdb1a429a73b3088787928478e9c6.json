Rosengren speaks in New York, April 17, 2013. REUTERS/Keith Bedford/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve should be patient in assessing whether to cut interest rates and the strength of the U.S. consumer will be key, Boston Federal Reserve Bank President Eric Rosengren said on Friday.\n\n\u201cWhile U.S. consumers have been resilient to date, continued resilience is not guaranteed ... my view is that policymakers can be patient and continue to evaluate incoming data before taking additional action,\u201d Rosengren said in prepared remarks at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nRosengren, who has opposed the U.S. central bank\u2019s two interest-rate cuts this year, said the main question was whether consumer spending can continue to offset the negative impact of the Trump administration\u2019s trade wars and slowing global growth.\n\nThe United States was holding a second day of high-level trade talks with China on Friday in a bid to resolve their 15-month trade war.\n\nRosengren noted that despite those headwinds second-quarter U.S. economic growth was above the estimated long-term trend and that many economists continue to expect the economy to grow around its potential, but signaled that he was keeping an open mind on the future.\n\n\u201cMy forecast for the economy does not envision additional easing being necessary. However, should risks materialize and economic growth slow materially, to below the potential rate, I would be prepared to support aggressive easing,\u201d Rosengren said.\n\nFed policymakers voted 7-3 to cut interest rates at their last meeting in September and investors currently expect an additional quarter percentage point cut at the central bank\u2019s next meeting on October 29-30.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell did little to push back against those expectations in a speech earlier this week while minutes of the Fed\u2019s last meeting, released on Wednesday, made plain that deep divisions remain on the path ahead for monetary policy.\n\nRosengren said the economy was currently evolving as he expected despite the unanticipated increase in tariffs and slower growth of exports and business investment. The Fed\u2019s two rate cuts are also \u201clikely to provide some stimulus over the next several quarters,\u201d he added.", "description": "The Federal Reserve should be patient in assessing whether to cut interest rates and the strength of the U.S. consumer will be key, Boston Federal Reserve Bank President Eric Rosengren said on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439782130&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A1SS", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
