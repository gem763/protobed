The party came within seven seats of winning a super majority in the state House, too, with eight runoff elections to come in November.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGov. John Bel Edwards (D) easily led the field of candidates running for the state\u2019s top office, but he did not win a majority of the vote, which would have allowed him to avoid the Nov. 16 runoff.\n\nInstead, his two leading opponents \u2014 businessman Eddie Rispone (R) and Rep. Ralph Abraham (R) \u2014 captured a combined 52 percent of the vote. That gives Rispone, who finished about 4 percentage points ahead of Abraham, a path to win the runoff.\n\n\u201cYou can turn this state around with the right team and the right attitude, and you can shake up this state and make it great again,\u201d Rispone said Saturday at his victory party.\n\nEdwards\u2019s campaign on Monday released an internal survey, conducted before Saturday\u2019s all-party primary, showing the governor leading Rispone 52 percent to 36 percent. But most, if not all, Abraham voters are likely to coalesce around Rispone.\n\n\u201cWhile Governor Edwards has a strong, bipartisan record to advertise to voters over the next five weeks, Eddie Rispone is as phony as they get. While he\u2019s trying to sell himself as an outsider now, the truth is, Eddie Rispone\u2019s the ultimate insider,\u201d Edwards\u2019s campaign manager Richard Carbo wrote in a post-election memo.\n\nOn Saturday, despite an at-times bitter primary fight, Abraham endorsed his former rival.\n\nThe Republican gains in the first round, and their potential to pick up the supermajority in the House, could be a serious setback to Democratic efforts to draw more favorable legislative and congressional maps after the 2020 census.\n\nIf Republicans hold such substantial control over the legislature, they would be able to draw maps and override any vetoes Edwards would make \u2014 assuming he holds onto his job.\n\n\u201cToday was a great day for Republicans all the way down the ballot,\u201d Andrew Bautsch, the executive director of the Louisiana Republican Party, said in a statement late Saturday. \u201cLouisiana voters just elected the most Republican legislature in the state\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nAlso on the ballot on Saturday, Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser (R) and Attorney General Jeff Landry (R) easily won reelection. Republicans won the treasurer\u2019s office, and two Republicans will face each other in a runoff for insurance commissioner. Republican candidates led the initial round of balloting in races for agriculture commissioner and secretary of state, too.\n\nJohn Couvillon, a Louisiana-based pollster who surveyed the field extensively, said Republican gains came in districts that had long voted for Democratic legislators, even as they became more culturally conservative \u2014 so-called ancestrally Democratic regions in rural areas north and west of Lafayette.\n\nThe results suggest voters are wildly enthusiastic about casting their ballots, ahead of a presidential contest that is likely to produce the highest turnout in more than a century. More than 1.3 million voters cast their ballots on or ahead of Saturday\u2019s election, 200,000 more than the number of voters who cast a ballot in the 2015 primary.\n\nEdwards grabbed about 91 percent of the African American vote, according to Couvillon\u2019s estimates, a solid and necessary performance for any Democrat who hopes to win statewide office in a conservative Southern state.\n\nBut worryingly for the Democratic incumbent, African Americans made up a smaller percentage of the overall electorate than they have in past elections.", "description": "Louisiana voters took a significant step to the right on Saturday, as\u00a0Republicans notched wins up and down the ballot, giving their party an outside chance of sweeping to power just ahead of a crucial redistricting cycle that could cement t", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/statecapitolbuildings_louisiana_batonrouge_thinkstock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
