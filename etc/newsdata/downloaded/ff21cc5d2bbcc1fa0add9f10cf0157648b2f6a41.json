Foreign companies don't have to pay that | Sean Gallup/Getty Images Wanted: Perfect design for Europe\u2019s carbon border tax It won\u2019t be easy to come up with a scheme that follows global trade rules and doesn\u2019t unleash retaliation.\n\nThe EU wants to set a carbon border tax on imports to protect EU companies forced to comply with tough greenhouse gas rules. It just has to figure out how.\n\nThe idea is to prevent businesses from decamping to laxer jurisdictions \u2014 called carbon leakage \u2014 and to protect them from competitors in countries without their own carbon prices. Border levies flow into the EU's budget, meaning the tax could also help make up a shortfall caused by the U.K.'s departure.\n\nBut setting a carbon border levy is fiendishly difficult. The EU will be a pioneer if European Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen carries through with her promise to bring in a carbon border tax that would be \"fully compliant\" with global trade rules. It will \"start with a number of selected sectors and be gradually extended,\" she wrote in her political guidelines.\n\n\"There is no final plan as such. There are a lot of ideas,\" Kadri Simson, the nominee to be energy commissioner, said during her confirmation hearing on Thursday.\n\nBorder levies flow into the EU's budget, meaning the tax could also help make up a shortfall caused by the U.K.'s departure.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s services are already at work, and Paolo Gentiloni, Italy\u2019s commissioner-designate for the economy portfolio, is meant to lead on the proposal.\n\n\u201cWe will try to be very quick and effective on carbon border tax but the legal and technical elements to define are not simple,\u201d Gentiloni said Thursday during his hearing before the European Parliament's Monetary and Economic Affairs Committee.\n\nDifficult design\n\nAn EU carbon tax has to be designed to fairly apportion the costs of a product's carbon footprint, and to do it while not violating rules set by the World Trade Organization.\n\n\"Exactly how this is going to be done, I don't think anybody really knows that,\u201d Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the outgoing trade commissioner, told POLITICO.\n\nEuropean industries pay a carbon price set by the bloc's Emissions Trading System \u2014 currently about \u20ac25 per ton. Foreign companies don't have to pay that \u2014 making their products cheaper. A carbon border tax would make imports pay the same carbon price as domestic products. It should also act as an incentive to other economies wanting to sell to the EU to decarbonize their production processes.\n\n\"Exactly how this is going to be done, I don't think anybody really knows that\" \u2014 outgoing Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m\n\n\u201cWe need to have two objectives, increasing the price of CO2 and carbon tax at the borders. This is the effective way of increasing the cost of CO2 while avoiding the competition biases with Indians, Chinese or others,\u201d French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters last month.\n\nBerlin and Paris said they\u2019re open to \u201cexamine possible measures to prevent carbon leakage, notably a carbon border tax\u201d in a joint statement last month.\n\nGlobal trade rules forbid discrimination between imports and domestic goods; a carbon tax could be allowed on grounds of environmental protection, as long as it\u2019s not protectionism in disguise, and it's equivalent to measures imposed on domestic products. If the levy violates WTO rules it could open the EU to retaliation from the U.S. and other large trading blocs.\n\n\"The key is to structure any accompanying border measure as a straightforward extension of the domestic climate policy to imports,\u201d trade law professor and former WTO Appellate Body member Jennifer Hillman wrote in 2013.\n\nTo ensure WTO compatibility, the border price needs to be equivalent to the domestic one, and that\u2019s not easy.\n\nOne option the Commission is looking at is to use the annual average carbon price paid by a specific EU sector as a benchmark for a tariff. Imports produced with fewer emissions than their European equivalents, or which are already subject to an equal or higher carbon price at home, would be exempted.\n\nBerlin and Paris said they\u2019re open to \u201cexamine possible measures to prevent carbon leakage, notably a carbon border tax.\u201d\n\nTo do that, the EU would have to devise a way to calculate the carbon intensity of a product \u2014 hitting dirtier products harder than clean ones.\n\n\u201cThis is a big issue \u2026 And it gets very, very technical,\u201d said Henrik Horn, a fellow at the Bruegel think tank.\n\nA carbon tax also means a revolution in the bloc's Emissions Trading System (ETS). The current system of giving free emissions allowances to energy-intensive industries as a way to combat carbon leakage would have to be scrapped; everyone would have to pay the same.\n\n\"If industry will have a [carbon] border tax, what is the purpose of giving free allowances as well?\" said a senior EU official.\n\nThat upsets the steel industry. The Commission is looking at the sector as a test case for a border levy, due to its potential to decarbonize by switching from coke to hydrogen or gas-fired furnaces, and the high competition it faces from Chinese imports.\n\nThe steel industry backs a carbon border levy as long as it gets to keep existing free allowances.\n\n\"If industry will have a [carbon] border tax, what is the purpose of giving free allowances as well?\" \u2014 senior EU official\n\n\"Keeping the leakage measures in place would allow us at least for a transition period to have a level playing field,\" or else EU steel \"will simply be kicked out of the global market,\" said Axel Eggert, director general of Eurofer, the sector's lobby.\n\nBut that undermines the goal of decarbonization.\n\n\"That would be a double waste of taxpayers money,\" said Sam Van den plas, policy director at NGO Carbon Market Watch.\n\nThe Trump factor\n\nEven if the Commission comes up with a clever design approved by the WTO and EU governments, this wouldn't necessarily shelter the EU from retaliation.\n\n\u201cI expect there will be some countermeasures,\u201d said Bernd Lange, a German Socialist MEP who chairs the trade committee in the European Parliament.\n\nThat's why export-driven economies such as Germany have traditionally been skeptical of border levies. But the global instability unleashed by U.S. President Donald Trump, his trade war with China, threats of hitting European exports with tariffs and his attacks on the WTO may have changed the calculation.\n\n\u201cThe WTO, it used to be something holy \u2026 These are holy principles, and you don't touch them. But then Trump did, and still does,\u201d said Horn.\n\nJakob Hanke and Rym Momtaz contributed reporting.\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
