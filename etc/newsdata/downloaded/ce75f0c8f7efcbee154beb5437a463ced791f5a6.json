I turn on my Nintendo systems for one of two things: weird games (a really weird one is coming out on Friday) and well-designed, gameplay-first adventures I can get lost in on my own. Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3 is that last thing.\n\nI\u2019m about three hours into the new game from Nintendo and the ever-excellent Luigi\u2019s Mansion veterans at Next Level Games. I\u2019m having a great time. Sure, this game can be played in co-op, with a second player controlling Gooigi, but I\u2019m hoarding the fun for myself. I\u2019ve been wanting a game like this. With respect to a lot of the bigger Nintendo games of late, they\u2019ve catered more to the multiplayer crowd or to tastes that run a little different than mine. I grew up on Nintendo\u2019s solo adventures and craved the deeper, more exploratory ones like Metroid and Zelda. Luigi\u2019s Mansion games keep good company with those.\n\nFor this third game of the series, I\u2019m once again in control of Luigi and using a vacuum to suck up ghosts, though I\u2019m exploring a hotel this time, unlocking and poking through floor after floor. Old moves like stunning ghosts with flashlights and revealing hidden objects with a dark light return. Combat gets a twist with the ability to slam ghosts as you are trying to vacuum them. Just a few hours in, new moves involving shooting plungers and spawning (then teaming up with) Gooigi are already being used well in puzzles and combat.\n\nCheck out the video atop the post for more about how the game works.\n\nThe flow of the game has been pleasant so far. I steer Luigi through the floor of the hotel, trying to vacuum couch cushions, curtains and everything else in sight. (For the record, all this vacuuming feels better than anything else I\u2019ve done in games this year.) I then press X to interact with anything I can find in a room \u2014 sinks and pool tables and trash bins, etc \u2014 hoping to find hidden ghosts. I zap ghosts with the flashlight, vacuum them down and then poke around some more.\n\nAn example of how this plays out: I\u2019ll be in a bathroom and notice that a mirror is reflecting an otherwise invisible sewer grate on the floor, use my flashlight\u2019s darklight beam to reveal it, then activate Gooigi and use him to slide down through the grate and explore the drainage system below the bathroom. This is the constant experience of the game.\n\nYou\u2019re constantly discovering hidden nooks and crannies and the treasures and ghosts tucked into them. You don\u2019t need to find everything, but if you like to explore and investigate, the game will give you ample opportunity. If you find everything there is to do in one of the hotel\u2019s many rooms, the lights will brighten. You\u2019ve basically gotten the all-clear that you\u2019ve thoroughly and completely scoured the room. It\u2019s very satisfying.\n\nCould it all go bad? Sure. This is one of those previews a game company allows two weeks before review. The game\u2019s done, but I\u2019m not far enough in it to know if it all falls apart. I don\u2019t think it will. I don\u2019t want it to. But we\u2019ll be able to tell you for sure how well it holds up in about two weeks.", "description": "You can have your Smash Bros and your Splatoons, your Wii U ports and your raft of tepidly reviewed JRPGs.
