A nod to the WAG drama between Rebekah Vardy and Coleen Rooney.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t had a chance to catch up on the situation, here\u2019s a quick breakdown: Coleen has accused Rebekah of leaking stories about her to the press and took to social media to share this news. She wrote a lengthy message in her Notes app, with the final sentence revealing the culprit: \u2018It\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u2026.Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account\u2019. Meanwhile, Vardy denies that she\u2019s done anything of the sort.\n\nDays after this incident, student Maya had a lightbulb moment while trying to figure out what to wear for a party for the Athletic Union in Liverpool\u2019s Georgian Quarter, and the look has since gone viral.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe student wore snakeskin top and leather skirt, and topped the outfit off by hanging a piece of cardboard in front of her chest, with the now infamous phrase \u2018It\u2019s\u2026\u2026..Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account\u2019.\n\nShe later uploaded the pic to Reddit with the caption \u2018My half a**ed fancy dress turned out to be pretty popular last night\u2019.\n\nThe post has since racked up hundreds of comments, but it appears to have made its way to other social media sites too.\n\nMaya wore the outfit to a fancy dress party in Liverpool (Picture: maya0813/Reddit)\n\n\u2018You were on everybody\u2019s Snapchat story that I knew, love it,\u2019 wrote one person.\n\nSomeone else said: \u2018It\u2019s hilarious, regardless if you care about WAG drama or not.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, some people questioned the \u2018warpaint\u2019 (orange lines) on Maya\u2019s cheeks.\n\nOne person said: \u2018Is this an early Halloween costume and you are a zombie version of Colleen Rooney? Or is it bad lighting/a filter?\u2019\n\n\u2018What are you actually dressed as though?,\u2019 asked someone else.\n\n\u2018Coleen Rooney\u2019s tweet? The orange warpaint is confusing me.\u2019\n\nMaya went on to reply by saying: \u2018Don\u2019t have a clue tbh was a last minute costume! People tended to call me Coleen all night so I went with that.\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t quite remember how I got the warpaint.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe two celebs are having an all-out war on social media, so it kind of makes sense, when you think about it.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Maya, a student at University of Liverpool, has gone viral for wearing an outfit with a nod to the Rebekah Vardy and Coleen Rooney incident.", "authors": ["Almara Abgarian"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_89831915_1571065629.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
