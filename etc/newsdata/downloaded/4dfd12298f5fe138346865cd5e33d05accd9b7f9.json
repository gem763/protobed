And yet it\u2019s about far more than simply a number next to a name. Our sense of who is old in this primary has become entwined with our appetite for bold and new ideas. All three of the top-polling Democrats, after all, are in their 70s, but it\u2019s Biden, the centrist who advocates for a return to a pre-Trump time, who is getting dinged the most for his advanced age\u2014not Elizabeth Warren, who wants \u201cbig, structural change\u201d and turned 70 in June. Up until this week when he had to have two heart stents implanted, neither was Bernie Sanders, who continues to call for his \u201crevolution\u201d and is in fact the oldest of the lot.\n\nBut there is an entire cohort of Biden supporters for whom his age\u2014actual and perceived\u2014is the very thing that recommends him. After the tumult of the Trump years, these voters crave the experience and order and stability Biden promises. For them, Biden is the beneficiary of shifting social and cultural notions that make it harder to pinpoint what it actually means to be old. Federal law protects workers from age discrimination starting at 40. People can join AARP at 50. They\u2019re usually eligible for Medicare at 65 and Social Security at 66. Scientifically, though, a half-dozen aging experts I talked to for this story told me, there\u2019s such vast variability in how people age that it\u2019s ill-advised and even irresponsible to try to draw conclusions about an individual based on a date of birth. \u201cThere are people at 80 who perform better than 20-year-olds,\u201d said Christopher Van Dyck of Yale University, \u201ceven on these cognitive speed, memory-type tasks.\u201d Furthermore, beyond decades of a healthy diet and sufficient exercise, a significant, intangible, practically mysterious part of the nature of anybody\u2019s aging, said Tracy Chippendale of New York University, is just \u2026 luck. Genes. Joe Biden\u2019s father died at 86. His mother died at 92. People, said Denise Park of the University of Texas at Dallas, have to make a determination \u201cbased on the behavior that they observe.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s essentially what Biden\u2019s repeatedly asked voters to do.\n\n\u201cWatch me,\u201d he said in June. \u201cJust watch me.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Michael Kruse", "Politico.Com Magazine Story"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
