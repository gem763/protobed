Country 195 of 195! So much to say but for now I will just say thank you to this entire community for all of your support. This was our journey and thanks to all of you who came along for the ride!! Thanks to the 54 people that are here celebrating with me in the Seychelles with the gorgeous backdrop of the @thehresortseychelles with the planning expertise of @vividvibeseventplanning! Last night was unreal and I\u2019m so so grateful. My heart is full!!!\n\nJessica started her travelling from the tender age of six although her decision to tackle the globe was only made two and a half years ago. At the time she had already been to 60 countries leaving her with 135 more to explore. This meant she had to travel 135 countries in just 2-and-a-half years, an average of just under 7 days per country OkayAfrica reports.\n\nShe uses both her Ugandan and American passport in her travels. Her curiosity is what fuels her travels, \u201cI began my journey to every country in the world because I am a geography nerd, curious about other cultures, and want to show the world through a lens that we rarely view it from\u2014that of a black woman.\u201d She wanted to break the stigma attached to certain countries, \u201cthat many countries are dangerous, that people are miserable, that you cannot have nice, luxury, vacations on the continent\u201d she says with an emphasis on Africa.\n\nYou can view her well documented journey on her Instagram account, and see what more she will be getting up to now.", "description": "If ever you needed inspiration to get up and put on your explorer boots, Jessica Nabongo (34) will sure give you the worst case of Fear of Missing Out, to shame you out of your seat.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9465/63ed7288654b4b64ab64b3e18ad59788.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
