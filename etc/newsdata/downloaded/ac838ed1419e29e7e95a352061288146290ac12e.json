So we are taking measures to save the country,\" the prime minister said.\n\nHariri said Lebanon's credit rating downgrade by Fitch to CCC 10 days ago was a warning to take the needed measures to shore investor confidence before it was late.\n\nFitch said its downgrade from B- reflected \"intensifying pressure on Lebanon's financing model and increasing risks to the government's debt servicing capacity.\"\n\nLebanese leaders have warned of a financial crisis without changes. The impetus to enact reforms has grown with the slowdown of deposits into Lebanon's banking sector, a critical source of finance for the state.", "description": "Lebanon to announce state of economic emergency, plan to accelerate reforms", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF811KM_L.jpg"}
