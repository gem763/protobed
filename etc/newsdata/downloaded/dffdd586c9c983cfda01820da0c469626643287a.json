This book is a journal of Walter's journey. This is a testimony to read and be inspired by.\"\n\n\u2014Alveda King, Pro-Life Activist; Niece of Martin Luther King Jr., from the Foreword\n\n\"Few people are willing to suffer targeting and deprivation of freedom for the sake of justice. Walter Hoye is one such hero. Anyone who looks for inspiration to do what is right no matter the cost \u2014or doubts the logical and moral coherence of being black and pro-life \u2014needs to read this book.\"\n\n\u2014 Most Rev. Salvatore Cordileone, Archbishop of San Francisco\n\n\"Walter Hoye went to jail and did hard time for violating a law that even the judge didn't understand. All pro-lifers should thank Walter for his sacrifice and help. I do.\"\n\n\u2014 Joe Scheidler, Founder, Pro-Life Action League; Author, Racketeer for Life\n\n\"Our walk on eggshells, politically correct approach to race has led many to be silent about the devastating impact abortion is having on the black community. Walter is anything but silent. Walter's courage and passion are gifts from God and a light in troubled times.\"\n\n\u2014 Shawn Carney, C.E.O. and President, 40 Days for Life\n\n\"A book every pro-lifer needs to study. We are not just to 'involve' the black community in the pro-life movement, but rather to encourage them to embrace this movement as their own.\"\n\n\u2014 Fr. Frank Pavone, National Director, Priests for Life\n\n\"This is rich reading \u2014quietly riveting and audaciously inspiring. When a law is made to jail a non-violent, peaceful man, it reveals the true strength of his humble character.\"\n\n\u2014 Johnny Hunter, D.D., National Director of Life Education and Resource Network\n\n\"Black And Pro-Life in America is a remarkable and riveting account of the extraordinary pro-life witness of Pastor Walter Hoye, whose dauntless defense of the sanctity of human life and commitment to helping women in crisis pregnancy situations came at a great cost \u2014imprisonment.\"\n\n\u2014 Obianuju Ekeocha, Author, Target Africa: Ideological Neocolonialism in the Twenty-First Century", "description": "", "authors": ["Ruth V.K.
