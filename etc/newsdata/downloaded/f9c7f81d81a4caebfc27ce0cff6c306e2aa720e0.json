I am trying hard [to get justice] because I don\u2019t want other women to go through this\u201d, she says.\n\nThe test, described by Human Rights Watch as \u201cinvasive, humiliating, and inhumane\u201d, involves inserting two fingers into the vagina for doctors to then assess its laxity before making a conclusion on whether the woman has had sex. The inefficient test was banned by India in 2016, but appears to still be used.\n\nIn June 2018, Maneka Gandhi, India's Women and Child Development Minister, announced that SAFE kits (Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence) would be distributed to all hospitals across India. In cases of rape allegations, kits can carry out immediate medical investigation and collect forensic evidence. Each kit has a set of swabs, test tubes, chemicals for preservation and bottles to secure hair, urine, saliva samples, without which rape cases fall apart.\n\n\u201cWhere I am from it is not unusual for men to think they can get away with rape because they know that two finger test records no evidence\u201d, says Ishani*, who was raped by her uncle for five months until she was able to escape and report the incident. She went to get herself tested at Dewas Government Hospital in Madhya Pradesh in June 2019 \u2013 but doctors still used the two-finger test.\n\nOne of the problems is that the government is currently only supplying kits to a selected number of hospitals, with many not having access. Supply depends on national and state level budgets, said Dr. Ulhas Gonnade, head of forensic medicine at Government Medical College Raipur, and so only hospitals with highly sophisticated labs are given priority.\n\nIn Madhya Pradesh, the state with highest number of rape cases according to National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), the kits are not available.\n\n\u201cEveryone is only aware of the two finger test here, they don\u2019t know it is a malpractice\u201d said Amu Vinzuda, program coordinator for Jansahas, a charity which supports women who are victims of violence.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Little to no trust in police and low conviction rates are seen as the main factors that prevent women from reporting assaults.\n\nAccording to one national survey, 99 per cent of cases involving sexual assault go unreported in India. For Ishani, police were reluctant to lodge a complaint because her assaulter was an influential government employee, and Yashvi was suggested to marry her rapist by police.\n\n\u201cTheir aim is to get as less rape cases on record as possible, and so their first attempt is to scare victims,\u201d said Manju Chouhan, a social worker at JanSahas.\n\nInspector Sunil Yadav from Dewas district police station in Madhya Pradesh denied all claims regarding police being uncooperative.\n\n\u201cThis is untrue, it doesn\u2019t happen in my station\u201d, he said.\n\nHospital staff are also often unsupportive, and it is becomes an extremely harrowing experience for victims, explained Ms Chouhan.\n\nYashvi recounted how her nurse rebuked her during her examination: \u201cBecause of your sexual pleasures, our time is constantly wasted\u201d.\n\nShe said she was traumatised by the medical staff at Jabalpur Government Hospital, with the doctor telling her how he was \u201cfed up\u201d of going to the court constantly to give testimonies.\n\n* The names of the women have been changed", "description": "India may have banned two-finger virginity test, but three years on doctors are still subjecting rape victims to the humiliating and invasive procedure instead of using the government\u2019s rape tests kits, re-traumatising already vulnerable women.
