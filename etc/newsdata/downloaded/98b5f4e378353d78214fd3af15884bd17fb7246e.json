The operation could take 12 hours or more,\" she said.\n\nThere were conflicting reports of the depth of the well, with estimates saying it is between 180 and 300 metres (591 and 984 feet).\n\nOfficials expressed concern as Sujith has been trapped in the bore-well without food and water.\n\n\"Unfortunately since he slipped, he is engulfed by mud. Only his palm and fingers can be seen with the help of the camera. We just hope he has found an air pocket ... the situation is grim but we are trying our best,\" Nambiar said.\n\nOxygen was being supplied but he had stopped responding to calls, local media reported, adding prayers were also being held in temples, mosques and churches in the state.", "description": "Chances of two-year-old boy look bleak four days after falling into abandoned bore well in Tamil Nadu's Trichy district.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/28/1fe2d16d9e1847f1a8cdd1c50083048b_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
