Organizers describe it as a national effort, with similar swing state training sessions already held or planned for the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the University of Denver and college Republicans in Michigan.\n\nIt\u2019s aimed at building on young voters\u2019 enthusiasm and higher-than-usual turnout in last year\u2019s midterm election and pushing back against any stifling of conservative voices in campus environments, said Mandi Merritt, a regional spokeswoman for the Trump-RNC reelection effort.\n\n\u201cIt serves as a way to bring conservative supporters out of the shadows of college campuses and show that they have a home in the Republican movement,\u201d Merritt said.\n\nIn the 2018 midterms, 67% of voters ages 18 to 22 voted for Democratic House candidates, according to AP VoteCast, which surveyed voters in last year\u2019s election. Just 31% voted for Republicans.\n\nThe outreach and mobilizing also show how the GOP is enlisting the youngest voters in its field operations and fighting for Republican votes outside the party\u2019s base, in a demographic that favored Democrats by significant margins in recent elections, said University of Cincinnati political scientist David Niven.\n\n\u201cIf you think the election is going to be close, this is the margin of victory,\u201d Niven said. \u201cThis is the 1% difference that helps you get over the top. \u2026 They are proclaiming: This is a state we need to fight for.\u201d\n\nIn Akron, which last week had the first \u201cMake Campus Great Again\u201d session for more than 50 students from several northeastern Ohio universities, junior Brooke Bihlman said she and fellow members of the University of Akron College Republicans will be talking with students between classes and going door-to-door on weekends in a friendly competition with their Democratic counterparts on campus to see who can register the most voters.\n\n\u201cI think everyone in the club right now is just feeling very excited about the future and what we can do to help,\u201d said Bihlman, 20. \u201cSeeing hard work pay off is obviously something that keeps a lot of us going, so it starts with the little stuff right now.\u201d\n\nPersuading peers to actually cast ballots might be tougher. Eighteen-to-29-year-olds typically have a much lower turnout rate than older voters, a point noted by some of the Democratic presidential candidates already organizing heavily on campuses in Iowa, which has the first caucuses.\n\nSupport from young voters helped propel Democrat Barack Obama to victory in 2008 and 2012, and they heavily favored Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016.\n\nThis time around, young Republicans touting Trump to their classmates point to a promising job market with the U.S. unemployment rate near a 50-year low , and to the president\u2019s executive order earlier this year that required U.S. colleges to protect free speech on their campuses or risk losing federal research funding.\n\nEven for a generation saturated in social media, there is no replacement for talking about the issues and candidates face-to-face with potential voters, said Seth Koellner, a Kent State University junior who leads the Ohio College Republican Federation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different than someone just scrolling past a post on Twitter,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it really grabs someone\u2019s attention and will cause them to actually think about what your message is.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Republican National Committee is putting a college twist on its grassroots voter registration efforts, seeking to mobilize President Donald Trump's supporters.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kantele Franko"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/Election_2020_Trump_Campuses_44995.jpg-9d778_c0-28-2000-1194_s1770x1032.jpg?f9a9ebdf9c86aab52e32e350e95213856ab2596c"}
