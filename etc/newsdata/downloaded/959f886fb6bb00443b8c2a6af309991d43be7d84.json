You\u2019re Not The Only One", "language": "en", "text": "If you feel as though you struggle to relax fully, you\u2019re not the only one. Around six in 10 people of roughly millennial age say they never truly relax because they\u2019re always checking their phones, a new poll has found.\n\nThe poll of 2,000 adults by Treatwell found that young people aged between 18 and 34 only properly relax for an hour a day \u2013 a total of just seven hours a week.\n\nOne in 10 people who completed the poll said they find it hard not to check their phone for any longer than 10 minutes.\n\nA Treatwell spokesperson said in response to the results: \u201cRelaxing is hugely important, but it\u2019s something we often relegate to the back burner of our lives. Thanks to mobile phones and everything they allow us to do, it means that often when we are \u2018relaxing\u2019, we are still \u2018switched-on\u2019.\n\n\u201cNeglecting our relaxation time can have a really detrimental effect on us, but it can happen quite slowly, so you don\u2019t realise it\u2019s happening,\u201d the spokesperson added. \u201cOften it takes someone else buying us a gift or taking some of the load from us, to \u2018force\u2019 us into a change of habits.\u201d\n\nIn response to our over-dependence on phones and tech generally, digital minimalism has become an increasingly popular practice as people seek to declutter their online lives.\n\nCal Newport, writer of the book Digital Minimalism: On Living Better With Less Technology, defines it as \u201ca \u201cphilosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimised activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else\u201d.\n\nAnother recent poll found that the average person in the UK spends nearly three and a half hours on their phone a day \u2013 including close to an hour on social media.\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s been suggested that millennials can experience \u201cload rage\u201d more than 10 times a day as poor download speeds prevent something on their phone from loading properly.\n\n\u201cMy load rage can be especially high when I\u2019m underground and the Wi-Fi doesn\u2019t work,\u201d 25-year-old Eni told Refinery29 last month. \u201cI feel disconnected from the world, like I may miss something \u2013 unhealthy I know.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike what you see?
