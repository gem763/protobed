This is how I say goodbye to that and welcome a new chapter with those who are close to me,' she explained.\n\n'Isabela Merced represents everything that has and will continue to define me. It represents the values that were passed on from my grandmother.'\n\nNew story: Isabela made the announcement shortly before the release of her new bilingual single Papi on October 25\n\nHonoring her: 'Isabela Merced represents everything that has and will continue to define me. It represents the values that were passed on from my grandmother'; pictured in August\n\nIsabela described her grandmother as an essential part of her extended family.\n\n'She was a force of nature, unafraid of anything, always ready to take on every challenge and person that said she couldn\u2019t. At the same time, she loved her familia; nothing came before that.'\n\nIt wasn't just her philosophy about life that inspired the rising star \u2014 they also shared similar personalities and tastes.\n\n'Her ideal day would be a day at the beach with the family, music, dancing, and eating alitas [chicken wings] or ceviche.

I hope this continues on my grandmother\u2019s legacy because she left us too soon'; pictured in 2018\n\nThough she never met her, Isabela confessed that she though her grandmother's presence could be felt beyond the grave as her mother's guardian angel.\n\n'I hope that my fans learn to always respect the people who came before them \u2014 the people who got them to where they are. Because it's not a one-person thing. It is not \"I made it here by myself, I don't need anybody else.\"'\n\nDespite the impact of the life-altering decision, Isabela left most of her family members in the dark prior to her announcement, but she hopes her family back in Peru will appreciate the move.\n\nSocially conscious: Isabela said the track is a stand against toxic masculinity and womanizing men; still from Dora And The Lost City Of Gold\n\nThe actress and singer called her new track Papi a 'bop,' and revealed that the infectious song will feature lyrics in both English and Spanish.\n\nThough it's in the guise of a standard pop song, it takes a stand against toxic masculinity.\n\n'Something that is exciting about Papi is that the guy whom this song refers to will hear it. He \u2014 and other womanizing men \u2014 will hopefully get the message and treat ladies with the respect they deserve.'", "description": "Isabela Moner revealed in an interview Monday that she'll now be going by Isabela Merced, adopting the name of her Peruvian grandmother.
