Containing the substance graphene, the material\u2019s discovery earned the scientists who isolated it the 2010 Nobel Prize in physics.\n\n\n\nThe timepiece was created as a nod to Formula One, resembling the wheel design of the McLaren cars. It\u2019s a manually wound split-seconds chronograph movement with a tourbillon and a 30-minute totaliser along with torque and function indicators controlled by the crown.\n\nIt\u2019s also the lightest split-seconds chronograph ever made and the first co-branded timepiece from Richard Mille\u2019s partnership with McLaren-Honda, which arose from Mille\u2019s longtime relationship with F1 teams and their drivers who served as official ambassadors.\n\nJames Lamdin, the founder of vintage watch dealer Analog/Shift LLC, says the thief probably didn\u2019t realise the watch was limited edition, which makes it more difficult to resell.\n\n\"It was most likely targeted because it was a Richard Mille, not because it was a $1m Richard Mille,\" he says. The brand\u2019s watches, which are expensive across the board, have a distinctive look to them. Add in the recent popularity of Richard Mille\u2014Jay Z and Drake have recently worn them\u2014and the timepiece is incredibly identifiable, according to Lamdin.\n\nNot even the black market\n\nEven on the black market, the watch would only fetch a portion of the $1.3m. \"Any of the guys capable of spending that money are going to get one new,\" Lamdin says.\n\nEric Wind, owner of pre-owned watch site Wind Vintage, adds that watch thefts especially in Europe have become more common in recent years. For instance, tennis star Rafael Nadal\u2019s $376 000 Richard Mille RM027 tourbillon watch went missing from his hotel during the French Open in 2012 (it was later recovered).\n\n\"Thieves are definitely aware of what these watches look like, and they are a target for people,\" Wind says.\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky enough to own one, Wind advises making a record of your watch\u2019s serial number\u2014the only way to track it down if lost or stolen. Insurance is also always a good idea, especially if your timepiece is in the six-figure range.\n\nLaura Hughes, director of communications for Richard Mille, said the company did not wish to comment on the theft.", "description": "The watch - one of the most expensive ever made - contains (among other things) titanium and the substance graphene, the discovery of which earned the scientists who isolated it the 2010 Nobel Prize in physics.", "authors": ["Claire Ballentine"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3166/bba1dc67706942ccb6312492566c5f57.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-02"}
