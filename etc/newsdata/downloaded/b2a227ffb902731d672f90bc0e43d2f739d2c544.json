However, what would have been a giant leap for womankind was canceled \u2014 because NASA hadn\u2019t packed enough spacesuits.\n\nNow the space agency has announced it will finally make history on October 21, when Koch and Jessica Meir are set perform an excursion outside the International Space Station (ISS) \u2014 and making sure there are enough medium-sized spacesuits to outfit the female astronauts.\n\nIn the spacewalk back in March, McClain was replaced by a man because there was only one spacesuit available that could fit Koch and McClain. While the issue of space suit sizing may sound like an easy fix, fitting spacesuits isn\u2019t as simple as it sounds, given the body grows taller in microgravity. But the incident raised questions around where women stand in a typically male-dominated industry \u2014 it seemed like this problem could have been avoided if more women were considered at the planning stage.\n\nAccording to Kirk Shireman, NASA\u2019s program manager for the ISS, the space agency is well-prepared for this month\u2019s space walk with two medium-sized suits ready to go. The decision to launch a second medium-sized suit was down to the number of spacewalks NASA has planned this year; which is 10 in total.\n\nDuring a press conference on Friday, Shireman said: \u201cWe don\u2019t do it for a specific crew, what we do is we look over the next two years, and look at all the crew members who are certified, and say, \u2018Okay, what\u2019s the sweet spot?\u2019\u201d Shireman went on to say that over the next two years, a lot of \u2018medium suit people\u2019 will be heading to the ISS.\n\nThroughout NASA\u2019s history, more than 500 people have ventured out into space yet only 11 percent have been women. But things are looking up as Koch and McClain were both part of NASA\u2019s 2013 class which was half female.\n\nDuring an interview on NASA TV, Koch and McClain were asked how they felt about their accomplishments being qualified by their gender. Koch replied with: \u201cIn the end, I do think it\u2019s important because of the historical nature of what we\u2019re doing and in the past, women haven\u2019t always been at the table.\u201d\n\nOn October 21 at 6:30 a.m (Eastern), you can watch live coverage of Koch\u2019s and Meir\u2019s spacewalk on NASA TV.\n\nRead next: Widow of QuadrigaCX CEO gives $9M to trustee to help re-pay victims", "description": "In March, NASA had plans to conduct its first ever all-women spacewalk.
