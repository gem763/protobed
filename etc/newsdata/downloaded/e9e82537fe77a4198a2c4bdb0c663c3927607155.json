It was the big date after the official first game of the new season between the last champion Raptors and New Orleans in Toronto.\n\nKawhi dominates LeBron\n\nThe Clippers beat the Lakers 112-102. Kawhi Leonard looked every bit the player that just led Toronto to its first championship, scoring 30 points for the revamped Clippers while playing inspiring defense, at times really dominating his new Lakers rival LeBron James.\n\nJames controlled the ball for much of the night, but struggled offensively, scoring 18 points, while making just one of his five three-point attempts. The James-Davis duo so expected did not show its best, but Anthony Davis will be a double-digit guarantee all along the season.\n\nThe best team won\n\nLou Williams added 21 points, and Montrezl Harrell had 17 off the bench. The Lakers showed off their new 1-2 punch of James and Anthony Davis.\n\nDavis scored 25 points, making nine of 14 free throws, and James had 18. Danny Green outscored them both with 28 points, including seven three-pointers, in the highest-scoring debut by a Laker in franchise history. With this win, the Clippers start the season off right and will be maybe the LA/California team to beat. One thing is sure when Paul George goes back, and the franchisee will be very hard to play.\n\nThe Clippers will play against the Warriors tomorrow, whereas the Lakes will host Utah in two days.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!
