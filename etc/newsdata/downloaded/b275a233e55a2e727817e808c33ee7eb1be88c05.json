REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay\n\nThe plan to ditch Kerkhoff after 14 months follows a dramatic loss of confidence among key investors, who no longer believe the 51-year old can deliver a turnaround that includes selling the company\u2019s most profitable division, elevators.\n\nIt adds to turmoil at a company that has struggled to cope with falling steel prices, a weak car market and a cooling global economy. Since Kerkhoff became CEO in July 2018, the firm has issued four profit warnings.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, we see an increasing risk surrounding a timely execution of the elevator business strategy, in turn creating further questions over whether the company\u2019s stretched balance sheet can be fixed over the next 6-12 months,\u201d Credit Suisse analysts wrote, keeping an \u201cunderperform\u201d rating.\n\nShares in the group traded 1.1% lower at 1038 GMT.\n\nKerkhoff is set to be replaced on an interim basis by Supervisory Board Chairwoman Martina Merz, who will face pressure to quickly find a buyer for the elevator business, which is valued at up to 17 billion euros ($18.7 billion), more than twice that of its parent.\n\nKerkhoff\u2019s plan to sell or list elevators, raise margins and find new ownership structures for Thyssenkrupp\u2019s other divisions was executed poorly and failed to create momentum, said two people familiar with the matter.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why Thyssenkrupp\u2019s key owners had to hit the \u2018emergency brake\u2019,\u201d one of the sources said, after Thyssenkrupp did not give a reason for Kerkhoff\u2019s departure in its statement.\n\nGrowing scepticism has been reflected in a 40% share price decline since Kerkhoff became CEO, compounded by two failed restructuring plans under his watch: a spin off of the capital goods units and a joint venture with Tata Steel (TISC.NS).\n\nLars Foerberg, founding partner of Thyssenkrupp\u2019s second-largest shareholder, Cevian, said he fully supported the appointment of Merz, a former Bosch [ROBG.UL] manager who became chairwoman in February.\n\nFASTER TURNAROUND\n\nThis echoed remarks by the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach foundation, the biggest shareholder with a 21% stake.\n\nIf elected CEO, Merz\u2019s duties as chairwoman will be taken over on an interim basis by former Siemens (SIEGn.DE) board member Siegfried Russwurm, who sits on Thyssenkrupp\u2019s supervisory board.\n\nThe company said it would recommend that Klaus Keysberg, head of the group\u2019s Materials Services business, join the board.\n\n\u201cWe expect that the new leadership will speed up the transformation process that Thyssenkrupp so urgently needs, and improve the quality of implementation. We are confident that Thyssenkrupp will now finally get a crystal clear strategy and a well-defined plan of action,\u201d Foerberg said.\n\nUnder Merz, who also sits on the steering committees of Lufthansa (LHAG.DE), Volvo (VOLVb.ST) and automotive supplier SAF Holland (SFQN.DE), the existing turnaround plan is expected to gather pace.\n\nDirk Sievers, head of Thyssenkrupp\u2019s works council and a member of the group\u2019s supervisory board, said the group\u2019s strategy needed to be implemented faster and more consistently now, adding there would be no change to the existing plans.\n\nThyssenkrupp\u2019s supervisory board will decide on the proposals at an extraordinary meeting shortly, the company said.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\n\u201cThe realignment of the group announced in May 2019 and unanimously approved by the supervisory board will be systematically continued. The focus will be on the three areas \u2018performance first\u2019, \u2018flexible portfolio\u2019 and \u2018efficient organization\u2019,\u201d it said.\n\nKerkhoff, who joined Thyssenkrupp as finance chief in 2011, took over as CEO last year following tumultuous weeks during which the conglomerate\u2019s former CEO and chairman also left due to mounting investor pressure over strategic issues.", "description": "Thyssenkrupp said it was preparing to replace its chief executive Guido Kerkhoff, making him the latest casualty at the German steel-to-submarines conglomerate which has been in crisis mode for more than a year.", "authors": ["Christoph Steitz", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433728813&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O0UQ", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
