On Friday evening, an explosion occurred near a U.S. military position outside Kobane, a Syrian border town where U.S. troops remain, said a U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.\n\n\n\nImams lead prayers Friday at the funeral of 9-month-old killed Thursday in Sanliurfa, Turkey, during a mortar attack from Syria. (Emrah Gurel/AP)\n\nIt was not immediately clear what the source of the explosion was, but no U.S. troops were injured or killed, the official said. U.S. military officials were investigating whether indirect fire, such as artillery or rockets, was the cause and who may have fired on the U.S. position if so.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know from where it came,\u201d the official said, adding that U.S. troops were in position at a small military outpost when the explosion happened.\n\nA few hours earlier, the Pentagon\u2019s top general, Army Gen. Mark A. Milley, said that Turkish forces know where American troops are in Syria \u201cdown to the grid\u201d on a map. He said U.S. troops retain the right to defend themselves as needed. He said that some U.S. forces in the region had been \u201crepositioned\u201d for force protection as Kurdish fighters, who were providing security for U.S. installations, had headed north toward Turkey.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Defense Ministry said in a statement that its troops had not fired on the U.S. soldiers. A Turkish border post south of the Turkish town of Suruc had come under attack Friday from hills approximately a kilometer southwest of a U.S. observation post and Turkish troops had fired back \u201cin self-defense,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cAll precautions were taken prior to opening fire in order to prevent any harm to the U.S. base,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe Turks acknowledged they had stopped firing after \u201creceiving information\u201d from the United States. One U.S. estimate found that a shell landed within a few hundred yards of American troops.\n\nMore than two dozen civilians have been killed on both sides of the border, including at least 12 people in Syria and 17 in Turkey, officials said. About 100,000 people have fled the Turkish advance in northern Syria, the United Nations said on Friday. A staff member of a nongovernmental organization working with Save the Children in the area said families were leaving the border areas, where fighting is concentrated, and other larger Syrian towns as a precautionary measure.\n\nTurkish border towns battered by mortar fire from Syria have also been emptied.\n\nThe Kurdish-led force, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), said on Friday that Islamic State detainees had escaped from a prison in the Syrian city of Qamishli after it was shelled by the Turkish military. A video released by the Kurds of what they said was the prison showed what appeared to be mortar shells landing in a courtyard and near a fountain. It also showed a group of people rushing through a door, though it was impossible to determine who those people were and whether they were fleeing or being escorted to safety.\n\nMervan Qamishlo, an SDF spokesman, said five Islamic State detainees had escaped as panicked guards fled the area. Turkey has denied claims that it is attacking Qamishli, saying it does not have military units in the area.\n\nTurkey\u2019s government has portrayed the offensive as a limited, careful operation aimed at clearing the border area of Kurdish fighters and establishing a \u201csafe zone\u201d in northeastern Syria, where it says at least 1 million Syrian refugees residing in Turkey would be resettled. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has promised to eliminate the threat from Islamic State militants and to send aid to areas affected by the violence once the operation is finished.\n\nTurkish officials have said the military intends to advance up to 19 miles into Syrian territory. They still had a considerable distance to go: By late Friday afternoon, as a column of Turkish tank carriers was seen lumbering toward the border town of Akcakale, Turkey, the Turks had advanced about five to six miles into Syria, according to estimates by Turkish and U.S. officials.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing any indication of . . . any planned stoppage,\u201d Milley said Friday at a Pentagon news conference.\n\nHe said that he was in regular contact with his Turkish counterpart and that the U.S. military was closely monitoring the progress of the incursion. \u201cRight now, the Turks have conducted airstrikes, with fixed-wing manned aircraft and with UAVs in both reconnaissance and strike mode . . . artillery strikes and some direct fire from tanks on the Turkish side,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTo our knowledge,\u201d Turkish operations have been \u201crelatively limited in terms of ground forces,\u201d Milley said, moving into Syria on both sides of the two main zones of attack along an 80-mile strip, bordered by Tal Abyad in the west and Ras al-Ayn in the east.\n\nTurkish light infantry forces numbering in the hundreds and about 1,000 Turkish-backed Syrian rebel forces were \u201ccoming south on both sides of the two zones,\u201d he said, and had reached about three to six miles inside Syria in the west and one to two miles in the east.\n\nMilley said the United States was asking the SDF \u201cto continue their partnership with the United States. Naturally, there is a considerable amount of anxiety\u201d on the part of the Kurds, and their leadership \u201chas given instructions to some forces to begin to move north.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re encouraging them not to overreact at this point, to tamp things down, to allow some sort of diplomatic resolution of all of this,\u201d he said.\n\nMilley and U.S. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said that counter-Islamic State operations were continuing throughout eastern Turkey outside of the zone where Turkey is operating in the north.\n\nWith fighting underway, both sides provided conflicting numbers of casualties. On Friday, the Turkish Defense Ministry said 342 \u201cterrorists\u201d \u2014 referring to Kurdish fighters \u2014 have been killed. The SDF said it had lost only 22 soldiers but claimed to have killed 262 Turkish soldiers and allied Syrian rebel fighters.\n\nThe Syrian National Army, an umbrella group for Turkish-backed Syrian rebels, said nine of its fighters had been killed. The Turkish Defense Ministry said two Turkish soldiers had been killed since the beginning of the operation.\n\nAn SDF statement said the two heavily populated northeastern towns of Amudah and Qamishli have suffered the brunt of the Turkish attack, with indiscriminate bombings that killed many civilians, but it did not specify a number.\n\nIn the southern Turkish town of Suruc, two civilians were killed Friday in a mortar attack launched from Syria, the state-run Anadolu Agency said. In Nusaybin, farther east, eight Turkish civilians were killed on Friday, the provincial governor said.\n\nA ceremony was held Friday morning in the city of Sanliurfa to honor two of Turkey\u2019s victims: Cihan Gunes, 31, and Muhammed Omar, who was 9 months old. They were killed in separate mortar attacks Thursday in Akcakale.\n\nGunes, who was employed in the municipal tax office in Sanliurfa but had gone to work in Akcakale for the day, was killed after a rocket fell in the courtyard of a government office, a police officer said. Omar, whose family is Syrian, was hit by shrapnel in front of his home.\n\nThe ceremony was packed with police officers and municipal workers. Their two wooden caskets, draped with Turkish flags, were displayed on stands covered in white tablecloths. A picture of Omar, wearing a white beanie, leaned against his coffin. \u201cMuhammed Omar\u2019s casket is small, but his heart is big,\u201d an imam said during prayers.\n\nA co-worker said Gunes had worked in the Sanliurfa tax office for about a year and a half and was engaged to be married. Another colleague, Halil Polat, called him \u201ca good guy, a nice guy.\u201d\n\nThey had spoken on Thursday. \u201cI jokingly told him I\u2019d say my prayers for him,\u201d Polat said.\n\nDeYoung reported from Washington.
