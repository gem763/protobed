When he wants to deliver a speech or major policy announcement, Mr. Trump likes the look (and the natural lighting) of the Rose Garden. When he wants to address the press, he paces about the South Lawn, bickering with reporters before boarding Marine One.\n\nThis is what Mr. Trump did on Monday when he defended the optics of his decision to secretly host members of the Taliban, the brutal militant group, at Camp David just days before the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks. The president had been seeking a peace agreement to end 18 years of war in Afghanistan, and he chose Camp David as the backdrop.\n\n\u201cCamp David has had many meetings that I guess people would have not considered politically correct,\u201d Mr. Trump said by way of explanation, adding that the retreat had hosted \u201cpretty tough customers and pretty bad people\u201d before.", "description": "Mr. Trump, not a frequent visitor to the \u201cvery rustic\u201d retreat, says it is a place where presidents have hosted \u201cpretty bad people.\u201d Not everyone agrees.", "authors": ["Katie Rogers"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/09/us/politics/09dc-memo/09dc-memo-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
