Roessler Jr. said Tuesday he suspended an officer who cooperated with federal deportation officers by turning over an illegal immigrant he encountered during a traffic stop \u2014 a move the chief said violated department policy.\n\nChief Roessler didn\u2019t identify the officer but said he \u201cdeprived a person of their freedom\u201d by cooperating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nThe chief called that unacceptable.\n\n\u201cOur county is one of the most diverse counties in the nation and no one should have the perception that FCPD is acting as a civil immigration agent for ICE,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis matter damages our reputation and the longstanding policy that I have stated many times that our officers shall not act as immigration agents.\u201d\n\nThe chief said the officer was working a traffic accident in the Huntington section of the Virginia county on Sept. 21 and came across someone without a driver\u2019s license. When the officer ran the name, it returned a flag from ICE, which said the immigrant was a fugitive after failing to appear for a deportation hearing.\n\nThe county\u2019s system confirmed the warrant. The officer called, and an ICE employee responded.\n\nChief Roessler said the county officer should not have detained the immigrant to turn over to ICE. He said that move broke department policy, which tells officers not to bother to confirm administrative warrants through the county\u2019s system. The majority of administrative warrants are from ICE.\n\n\u201cThe officer involved in this event has been relieved of all law enforcement duties pending the outcome of this investigation,\u201d the chief said.\n\nLuis Aguilar, director of CASA Virginia, a leading advocacy group for immigrants, said Chief Roessler\u2019s decision to suspend an officer was bold \u2014 and correct.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s a very appropriate action,\u201d Mr. Aguilar told The Washington Times. \u201cThis is local law enforcement, this is the local police department, and they cannot be enforcing federal immigration laws. \u2026 This is a clear message of where and how the chief of police thinks.\u201d\n\nICE did not respond to a request for comment, but the agency\u2019s acting director last week used a press conference at the White House to complain about communities that refused to cooperate with his deportation officers.\n\nMatthew T. Albence, the acting director of ICE, said police departments routinely cooperate with other departments on warrants and detention requests and there is no reason they should treat ICE \u2014 a federal law enforcement agency \u2014 differently.\n\n\u201cI guarantee you, I can go into Fairfax County [court] today and there will probably be sheriffs from Loudoun County, sheriffs from Prince William County, maybe a couple of Marshals guys that are there waiting for somebody,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a common occurrence in law enforcement. The only reason it\u2019s being made controversial is because politicians are looking to exploit it.\u201d\n\nJessica Vaughan, policy studies director at the Center for Immigration Studies, said Fairfax County\u2019s police department is getting the law enforcement equation backward.\n\n\u201cThe police chief is ordering an investigation of an officer who did exactly the right thing by responding to an active ICE warrant on an illegal alien who was a fugitive,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s astonishing that a police chief is more intent on punishing his officer than seeing to it that legitimate laws are enforced.\u201d\n\nShe disputed the police department\u2019s suggestion that the county officer was acting as an agent of ICE. She said that is no more true than if he had held someone for a warrant issued by neighboring Montgomery County in Maryland.\n\nShe said Fairfax police intended to shame the officer.\n\nChief Roessler said the illegal immigrant in question was picked up by ICE and has been processed and released on an ankle bracelet pending the outcome of deportation proceedings.\n\nMr. Aguilar said it\u2019s likely the migrant will be deported and the police officer will be responsible.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even know about the family itself, who\u2019s going to be separated. We don\u2019t know if there\u2019s kids involved,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
