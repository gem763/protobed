You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe book, which was kept by a pair of retired civil servants in a code-locked briefcase, is expected to fetch up to \u00a330,000 at auction this week.\n\nHere\u2019s what to look out for:\n\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\n\n\u2018Hardcover first edition first printings of this 1997 book have become the \u2018Holy Grail\u2019 for Potter collectors\u2026Only 500 were published and 300 went to libraries. The main characteristics of a 1997 first edition first issue are a print line that reads 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 and the crediting of \"Joanne Rowling\", not JK. Prices on AbeBooks vary from $40,000 to $55,000. A handful of advance proof copies are available from $7,500 to $13,500.\u2019\n\nThe first editions of the deluxe edition from 1999 are also desirable with prices from $450 to $2,500. Paperback first editions of the Philosopher\u2019s Stone are also quite scare and attract four-figure price-tags \u2013 sometimes five figures if in excellent condition.\n\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (US title)\n\n\"Prices for first edition first printings go up to around $6,500 with a fair selection between $4,000 and $5,000 \u2013 many signed by the author \u2013 although cheaper copies can be found.\"\n\nUS first editions will have the number line of 1 3 5 7 9 10 8 6 4 2 8 9/9 0/0 01 02,\" on the copyright page along with \u201cPrinted in the U.S.A.23\" and \"First American edition, October 1998\". Prices for later editions in good condition are in three figures.\u2019\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\n\n\"Prices for hardcover first edition first printings go up to $9,000. In 1998, JK Rowling was still a jobbing author rather than a worldwide superstar richer than the Queen, so there are a reasonable number of signed first editions available from her book tour signings. Deluxe editions can be priced in four figures if signed.\"\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\n\n\"The initial hardcover print run was stopped mid-printing after it was discovered that 'Joanne Rowling\u2019 rather than \u2018JK Rowling\u2019 had been printed on the copyright page. Joanne versions are available for prices starting at around \u00a31,500 and go up to $12,000 for signed pristine copies.\n\nFirst edition first printings will have the number line 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 and a block of misaligned text on page seven. Opinions about the number of copies printed before the errors were spotted vary greatly \u2013 however, it seems that only a small number came off the press which greatly enhances its value.\"\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

However second printings can be picked up for three figures.\"\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\n\n\"JK\u2019s signature (by book 4, she was signing fewer copies) turns any first edition of Goblet of Fire into a book with a four-figure price-tag but there are a handful of copies over $10,000. Look out for the limited editions with original watercolour illustrations by Giles Greenfield (Bloomsbury\u2019s UK edition) and Mary GrandPre (Scholastic\u2019s super rare US edition of only 25 copies). If either illustrator has signed a copy, then prices are again in four-figures. Many buyers are also looking for books accompanied by items such as entrance wristbands or golden tickets from events where JK Rowling has conducted a signing.\"\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\n\n\"Look out for first edition copies signed by JK Rowling at the midnight launch event in Edinburgh on 2003 that are going to be priced in four figures. Jason Cockroft illustrated the UK edition while Mary GrandPre illustrated the US version \u2013 their signatures enhance a book\u2019s value but such copies can be found for as little as $200.\"\n\nHarry Potter and the Half Blood Prince\n\n'Published in July 2005 to widespread Pottermania, JK\u2019s days of book tours were long gone so very few signed copies are on the market. A handful are available for prices up to $5,000.\u2019", "description": "An entire generation of book lovers are likely to have well-thumbed Harry Potter books lurking in cardboard boxes at their parents\u2019 houses... and some of them could prove to be goldmines.
