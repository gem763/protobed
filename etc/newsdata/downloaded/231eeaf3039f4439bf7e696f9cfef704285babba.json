REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo\n\nJust over a month before Britain is due to leave the European Union, it still remains unclear when, how or whether Brexit will take place on Oct. 31, amid deep divisions within both the ruling Conservatives and the Labour Party.\n\nCiting disloyalty over Brexit at a meeting of Labour\u2019s National Executive Committee on Friday, Jon Lansman, the founder of the left-wing grassroots movement Momentum, proposed a motion to abolish the deputy\u2019s post, according to two party officials.\n\nThe chair ruled that the motion should be thrown out but it is set to go back to the National Executive Committee on Saturday and, if successful, due to be debated by Labour\u2019s annual party conference later on, according to a source close to Lansman.\n\nWatson told BBC radio: \u201cI just think Jon Lansman and his faction are so angry about (my position on Brexit) that, they\u2019d rather abolish me than have a debate with me about it.\u201d\n\nA Labour Party spokesman declined to comment.\n\nThe Conservatives have been bitterly divided over Europe for decades and have expelled lawmakers as Prime Minister Boris Johnson promises to take Britain out of the EU with or without a deal, while others have simply quit.\n\nIn the Labour Party, Corbyn backs a second referendum only after an election, which could come as soon as this year, while Watson wants a new public vote to settle the matter before Britons choose a new government.\n\nWatson has been accused by some of Corbyn\u2019s supporters of being disloyal or even trying to undermine the Labour leader on a range of issues including allegations of anti-Semitism in the party.\n\nDawn Butler, Labour\u2019s spokeswoman for women and equalities, failed to fully back Watson when given the chance on Saturday.\n\nRelated Coverage Motion to oust Labour Party deputy leader withdrawn - lawmaker\n\n\u201cI have my frustrations with Tom too,\u201d she told BBC radio. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him at a shadow cabinet meeting for a while and so I can understand people\u2019s frustration - but we are a broad church.\u201d\n\nBut London Mayor Sadiq Khan, tipped as a possible future Labour leader, said the motion should be dropped.\n\n\u201cWe must focus on fighting against Boris Johnson & his catastrophic no-deal Brexit, not each other,\u201d he tweeted.", "description": "The deputy leader of Britain's main opposition Labour Party said on Saturday that his stance on Brexit, where he backs a second referendum before a parliamentary election, unlike leader Jeremy Corbyn, is behind efforts by some in the party to remove him.", "authors": ["Costas Pitas", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190921&t=2&i=1432267389&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8K06G", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
