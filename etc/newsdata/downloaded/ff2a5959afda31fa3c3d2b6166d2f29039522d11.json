The Europeans have so far signalled that the new deal, which removes the Irish backstop, is \u201cunacceptable\u201d and \u201cunworkable\u201d.\n\nThe Benn Act orders the prime minister to request another extension to Article 50 if an EU-approved deal is not passed by Parliament by October 19th. The law also stops the government from taking the UK out of the EU in a Clean-Break Brexit.\n\nMr Johnson has maintained that he will not seek another Brexit delay. But sources speaking to The Times suggests that civil servants and Eurocrats could circumvent the head of government to authorise another extension to January 31st, 2020.\n\nSeveral senior EU diplomatic sources told the newspaper that the letter could come from \u201cthe head of government or head of state\u201d such as a representative of the Crown, including the notoriously anti-Brexit Civil Service.\n\n\u201cWhat Article 50 says and requires is that the extension is agreed with the UK. Strictly speaking, it is silent on whether there should be a request or where the request should come from,\u201d one source said.\n\nEuropeans Reject Boris\u2019s Politically \u2018Unacceptable\u2019 Final Brexit Offer https://t.co/WLmhZzdmh8 \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 2, 2019\n\nAnother Brussels source said: \u201cI am sure the system will produce what we need to get to an extension.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t care who it is, whether it is the prime minister or another representative of the executive,\u201d they added.\n\nWhitehall sources have also said that the letter could come from Cabinet secretary Sir Mark Sedwill or the UK\u2019s ambassador to the EU Sir Tim Barrow.\n\nWhile Europeans were quick to communicate their disapproval of Mr Johnson\u2019s new deal, one European ambassador said that leaders had agreed to \u201creally look at the situation in the UK and see what the political argument would be for such a request\u201d at the European Council meeting on October 17th. Diplomats have said that no European leader is prepared to veto an extension to force a Clean-Break Brexit.\n\nCourt to Rule if Boris Can Be Jailed for Refusing to Delay Brexit https://t.co/i6gXLyVUJ1 \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 2, 2019\n\n\u201cPolitically, I don\u2019t see how we could refuse it. The Europeans don\u2019t want to take the responsibility for no deal,\u201d one official said.\n\nMedia reported on Tuesday that Remain activists are taking a case to the Scottish Court of Session to force Prime Minister Johnson to request the extension if he refuses. An Outer House judge will determine on Monday whether to elevate the case to the senior chamber of the court, the Inner House.\n\nThe Court of Session may rule that if Johnson refuses to request the extension, he could face a fine or even a prison sentence.", "description": "EU sources have said that they are willing to take any request for a Brexit delay -- even if it does not come from Prime Minister Johnson.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Tusk-Juncker-Barnier-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
