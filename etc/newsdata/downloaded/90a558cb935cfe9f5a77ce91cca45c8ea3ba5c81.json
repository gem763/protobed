The charity helps out women starting new jobs by giving them a back-to-work wardrobe, a mission Meghan described as \u201cdeeply important\u201d (you can click through the images on the embedded post below).\n\nThe pictures were issued in black-and-white, Meghan\u2019s preferred method of telegraphing seriousness as her Vogue effort demonstrated, and showed Meghan palling around with models on the set of a fashion shoot for her new Smart Set collection, which will be available in stores, online, and in the charity\u2019s dressing rooms across the U.K.\n\nThe women are dressed in the five pieces from the collection: a \u00a319.50 dress from Marks & Spencer; a \u00a3109 John Lewis tote bag; a \u00a3120 shirt from Meghan\u2019s designer friend Misha Nonoo, who is said to have introduced her to Harry; and a \u00a3199 jacket and \u00a3120 trousers, both from Jigsaw.\n\nMeghan said at the launch that she asked Jigsaw to collaborate because of an advertising campaign she had seen: \u201cI had seen a campaign that they had done the year before really highlighting the diversity of the U.K. and the immigrant culture and how that was a part of the fabric of the nation.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw that I was so touched by it and I thought anybody who is seeing the world that way and seeing the community that way is someone that I think would be a great partner to have on this project. They all said yes and that was a great start, so thank you so much for that.\u201d\n\nIll-informed critics were predictably quick to condemn the price points as out of reach of struggling women without realizing the key feature of the charity is that every time one of the items is bought at retail, a matching item is donated free to the charity.\n\nMeghan flagged her involvement with Smart Works in her issue of Vogue, and will formally unveil the collection this afternoon.\n\nIn her Instagram post, Meghan said: \u201cSince moving to the U.K., it has been deeply important to me to meet with communities and organizations on the ground doing meaningful work and to try to do whatever I can to help them amplify their impact.\n\n\u201cIt was just last September that we launched the Together cookbook with the women of the Hubb Kitchen in Grenfell. Now, one year later, I am excited to celebrate the launch of another initiative of women supporting women, and communities working together for the greater good.\n\n\u201cWhen you buy any item in the Smart Set Capsule Collection for Smart Works, the same item will be given to a Smart Works client, and with it, the confidence and support she needs to enter the workforce and take an important step in building a career.\n\n\u201cThank you to the four brands who came together in supporting Smart Works on this special project\u2014placing purpose over profit and community over competition.\n\n\u201cIn convening several companies rather than one, we\u2019ve demonstrated how we can work collectively to empower each other\u2014another layer to this communal success story, that I am so proud to be a part of.\u201d\n\nMeghan privately visited Smart Works several times before being named as its royal patron in January.", "description": "Meghan Markle returned from maternity leave today with a showstopping launch of a new charity workwear collection.", "authors": ["Tom Sykes"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568295193/190912-sykes-meghan-tease2_jqtzpz", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
