Treasury said it does not comment on specific cases.\n\nMr Rubio said there was growing evidence that TikTok in the United States was censoring content that is \"not in line\" with the Chinese government.\n\nChina \"is using these apps to advance their foreign policy and globally suppress freedom of speech, expression, and other freedoms that we as Americans so deeply cherish\", Mr Rubio said.\n\nGet the latest on startups\n\nand business news Terms & conditions Sign up\n\nA US TikTok spokesman said the company stores all of its US user data in the United States.\n\n\"The Chinese government does not request that TikTok censor content, and would not have jurisdiction regardless, as TikTok does not operate there,\" she added.\n\nLawyers said a CFIUS review of such a deal would be unusual for the panel, which has increasingly flexed its mucle to stymy Chinese investment in sensitive US industries but has shied away from using censureship to justify reviewing deals.\n\n\"It wouldn't be shocking, but it would be atypical,\" for CFIUS to review a transaction over censorship concerns, said David Hanke, a lawyer with Arent Fox who helped craft a legislative overhaul of the committee last year. \"It also would not be the first time CFIUS has blazed new trails over China-specific concerns,\" he added.\n\nThe 1950 law establishing CFIUS does not limit the definition of national security. However, another lawyer who declined to be named said CFIUS would likely flag critical technology or the acquisition of sensitive personal data if it took up the deal.\n\nByteDance is one of China's fastest growing startups. It owns the country's leading news aggregator, Jinri Toutiao, as well as TikTok, which has attracted celebrities like Ariana Grande and Katy Perry along with legions of US teenagers.\n\nThe company's Chinese ownership and sudden spike in popularity have raised concerns among US lawmakers.\n\nMr Rubio has become increasingly outspoken in his hawkish stance on China. He slammed the National Basketball Association this week for expressing regret over a deleted tweet by Rockets general manager Daryl Morey in support of Hong Kong protesters. He has also urged the Trump administration to bar exemptions that would allow us tech companies to sell to China's blacklisted telecoms giant Huawei.\n\nCongress cannot compel CFIUS to review individual cases, but the powerful committee does have jurisdiction to review deals that were not previously flagged to CFIUS by the parties involved.\n\nChinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd earlier this year agreed to a request by CFIUS to sell popular gay dating app Grindr, which it had owned since 2016.\n\nKunlun drew US ire after it gave some Beijing-based engineers access to personal information of millions of Americans such as private messages and HIV status.\n\nByteDance bought Musical.ly for nearly US$1 billion in December 2017. It later shuttered Musical.ly and moved users to a revamped version of its own TikTok app, which serves non-Chinese markets.\n\nMusical.ly, released in 2014, and TikTok, launched in 2016, both enable users to create and share short singing and dancing videos that are set to well-known songs, with numerous special effect filters.\n\nThe company's original app Douyin is similar to TikTok but is only available in China and complies with local censorship requirements.\n\nByteDance counts venture firm Sequoia Capital and big private-equity firms such as KKR, General Atlantic and Hillhouse Capital Group as backers, sources have told Reuters.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Garage - [WASHINGTON] Senator Marco Rubio on Wednesday asked a US national security panel to review TikTok owner Beijing ByteDance Technology Co's acquisition of Musical.ly, arguing TikTok is used by the Chinese government to censor politically sensitive content. .
