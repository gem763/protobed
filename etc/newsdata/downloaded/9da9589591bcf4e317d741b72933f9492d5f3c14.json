Chinese athletic apparel maker Li-Ning also released a statement saying it was upset with Morey's tweet.\n\n\"I did not intend my tweet to cause any offence to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,\" Morey tweeted early on Monday from Japan, where Houston is playing this week.\n\n\"I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.\n\n\"I have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention,\" Morey continued. \"My tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA.\"\n\nNBA Chief Communications Officer Mike Bass said the league recognised that Morey's tweet \"deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable\". Bass added that the league supported individuals \"sharing their views on matters important to them\".\n\n\"We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together,\" Bass said.\n\nEarlier, Fertitta attempted to distance the team from Morey's tweet with a Twitter post of his own: \"Listen.@darylmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe timing of this is particularly awkward for the NBA. China has teams in the US playing preseason games this week, the Rockets are about to play two games in Japan and the Los Angeles Lakers - with one of the biggest global sports stars in LeBron James - and Brooklyn Nets set to play on Thursday in Shanghai and Saturday in Shenzhen.\n\nAnd fostering strong relationships with China has been a priority of the NBA for at least three decades.\n\nThe NBA has a China office, just announced plans to add a gaming team in Shanghai to the NBA 2K League, and officials in both countries say as many as 500 million Chinese watched at least one NBA game last season.\n\nSeveral NBA players - including major current and former stars like Stephen Curry and Kobe Bryant - go to China annually to promote their individual brands, and the World Cup held in China earlier this summer saw countless fans attending in NBA jerseys.\n\nThe Rockets, largely because of Yao, have an enormous Chinese following. But after Morey's tweet, even the Chinese government's consulate office in Houston issued a statement saying it \"expressed strong dissatisfaction\" with the team.\n\n\"We have lodged representations and expressed strong dissatisfaction with the Houston Rockets, and urged the latter to correct the error and take immediate concrete measures to eliminate the adverse impact,\" the consulate general's office said in a statement Sunday.\n\nThe consulate did not specify what exactly it is seeking from the Rockets, and there was no immediate follow-up statement after Morey's attempt to clarify his thoughts.\n\nThe Chinese league said Sunday on its official Twitter-like Weibo account that Morey had made \"improper remarks regarding Hong Kong\" to which it expressed its \"strong opposition\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat underscores Beijing's extreme sensitivity about foreign attitudes toward the ongoing protests that have lately grown in violence. China accuses foreign parties in the US and elsewhere of encouraging the demonstrations.\n\nChina has pushed strongly for international companies to adhere to its views on the protests.\n\nCathay Pacific lost two executives after the government warned the Hong Kong airline that its employees would be barred from flying over or to the mainland if they joined the protests.\n\nAfter being criticised by Chinese social media users, Fashion brands Givenchy, Versace and Coach apologised for selling T-shirts that showed Hong Kong, as well as the Chinese territory of Macau and self-ruled Taiwan, as separate countries.\n\nLast year, 20 airlines including British Airways, Lufthansa and Air Canada changed their websites to call Taiwan part of China under orders from the Chinese regulator. The White House called the demand \"Orwellian nonsense\".\n\nAAP", "description": "Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tried on Monday (AEST) to defuse the rapidly growing fallout over his deleted tweet that showed support for Hong Kong anti-government protesters.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.301%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_75/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/831c4d7732884db012d44abc57d4524d98be6350", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
