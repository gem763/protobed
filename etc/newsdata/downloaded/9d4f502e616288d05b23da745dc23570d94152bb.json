The Obama-era rules were written following the collapse of for-profit college company Corinthian Colleges in 2015, when tens of thousands of former students flooded the Education Department with requests for loan forgiveness.\n\nDeVos previously said those standards allowed students to raise their hands and receive \u201cfree money\u201d from the government. For-profit colleges have also long criticized the rules as unfair.\n\nIn an announcement about the new rules, DeVos said on Friday that fraud in higher education \u201cwill not be tolerated\u201d by the Trump administration. The rules, she said, include \u201ccarefully crafted reforms that hold colleges and universities accountable and treat students and taxpayers fairly.\u201d\n\nThe tighter standards will reduce the amount of loan forgiveness provided to students by more than $500 million each year compared to the amount under the current Obama-era policies, the department estimated. The entire package of regulations \u2014 which also curtails loan discharges for students whose schools suddenly close \u2014 is projected to save taxpayers more than $11 billion over the next decade.\n\nMorning Education A daily dose of education policy news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

But it\u2019s not as restrictive as the one DeVos initially proposed last year.\n\nThe initial Trump administration plan would have required borrowers to prove that their college intentionally misled them in order for them to have their loans forgiven. It considered forcing student loan borrowers to wait until they had defaulted on their debt before allowing them to file a fraud claim, an obstacle that would have threatened borrowers\u2019 credit history and could have jeopardized security clearances for military servicemembers.\n\n\u201cWe made substantive changes to our proposed rule based\u201d on public input, DeVos said.\n\nBut those changes did not go far enough for consumer advocates and Democrats, who said Friday that the Trump administration was gutting important protections for students defrauded by their college.\n\n\u201cThis rule is another Trump-DeVos giveaway to their for-profit college cronies at the expense of defrauded student borrowers,\u201d said Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate.\n\nRep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), chairman of the House education committee, said that \"the Trump administration is sending an alarming message: Schools can cheat [their] student borrowers and still reap the rewards of federal student aid.\"\n\nHarvard Law School\u2019s Project on Predatory Student Lending \u2014 whose successful lawsuit last year forced DeVos to implement the Obama-era rules \u2014 vowed on Friday to bring a new legal challenge \u201cin the coming days\u201d to stop the latest regulations from taking effect.\n\n\u201cIf Betsy DeVos won\u2019t do her job and stand up for students, then we will fill that void,\u201d the organization\u2019s legal director, Eileen Connor, said in a statement. \u201cThat is why we will be filing a suit challenge these harmful new regulations that give a green light to for-profit colleges to continue scamming students.\u201d\n\nThe new rules narrow the type of misconduct by colleges that could trigger loan forgiveness and also require that borrowers provide more extensive documentation about the financial harm they faced. Borrowers will also have to file their claims within three years of leaving school.\n\nIn addition, the final rule allows colleges to resume using mandatory arbitration agreements in their enrollment agreements with students, reversing an Obama-era ban on the practice, which was common at for-profit schools.\n\nDeVos first proposed a rewrite of the \"borrower defense\" rules more than a year ago. Since then, she's been forced to implement the Obama administration's version of the rules after a federal court last fall struck down the Trump administration's efforts to delay them.\n\nThe Trump administration separately is facing criticism and a proposed class-action lawsuit over the backlog of existing \"borrower defense\" claims, which now exceeds 170,000 applications. The Education Department hasn't approved or denied any claims in more than a year.", "description": "They set a more stringent standard for when the Education Department will wipe out the debt of borrowers who say they were misled by their colleges.", "authors": ["Michael Stratford"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ed/ff/091aaa7e4fdbad48d30c3bb6a515/19830-betsy-devos-gty-773.jpg"}
