The movie was then shown at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nIn June, Botswana decriminalised homosexuality in a landmark ruling.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Social intolerance\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cWalking With Shadows\u201d tells the story of protagonist Ebele Njoko, who has remade himself as a successful and respected father and husband named Adrian after abandoning a gay relationship earlier in his life.\n\nWhen the affair is newly exposed, he chooses not to deny it to his wife and others in the face of growing hostility, and his fragile life soon begins to crumble.\n\nThe film\u2019s creators include Nigerian TV personality Funmi Iyanda. Her interview with Bisi Alimi, an openly gay Nigerian rights activist, caused a storm.\n\n\u201cThat experience opened my eye to the depth of homophobia and the heightened levels of social intolerance,\u201d Iyanda, who served as the creative director and a producer on the movie, wrote in a press release.\n\n\u201cI wanted to find the right story to tell about struggles with one\u2019s self and society\u2019s expectations in a country which was incredibly vibrant yet deeply and punitively conservative,\u201d she added.\n\nIyanda optioned Dibia\u2019s book in 2015 and began filming two years later, but struggled throughout to find those willing to fund a movie about such a topic.\n\nLondon-based Irish writer and director Aoife O\u2019Kelly said she was naturally drawn to directing it \u2014 her first feature-length film \u2014 after growing up in Ireland, where homosexuality was illegal until 1993.\n\n\u201cI was very empathetic towards the story,\u201d she told AFP, noting \u201cthe devastation\u201d the Irish law caused many people who were forced to hide their sexuality and persistently faced arrest or ostracisation.\n\n\u201cWhat I hope is that from the story people will gain an understanding of what someone has to go through\u2026 (keeping) themselves in hiding most of their lives, and the devastating consequences that will have on not just the person, but their family,\u201d O\u2019Kelly added.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 A film about the fallout from a romantic relationship between two Nigerian men has premiered in London before a hoped-for but likely", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/77d9c1_in-shadows-homosexual-is-outlawed-or-repressed-in-parts-africa-shadow-land-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
