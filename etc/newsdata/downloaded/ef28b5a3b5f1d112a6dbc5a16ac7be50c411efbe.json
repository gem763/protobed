REUTERS/Omar Sobhani\n\nThe attacks happened 11 days before Afghanistan\u2019s presidential elections, which Taliban commanders have vowed to violently disrupt, and follow collapsed peace talks between the United States and the insurgent group.\n\nGhani, who is seeking a second five-year term in voting on Sept. 28, was due to address a rally in Charikar, the capital of central Parwan province, when a bomber attacked the gathering.\n\nThe blast killed 24 people and wounded 31, said Abdul Qasim Sangin, head of Parwan\u2019s provincial hospital.\n\n\u201cWomen and children are among them and most of the victims seem to be the civilians. Ambulances are still operating, and the number of casualties may rise,\u201d Sangin said.\n\nA local government official said the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber. The president was nearby but unharmed, a Ghani aide said.\n\nIn a separate incident, a blast went off in the centre of the capital Kabul, sending ambulances and Afghan forces rushing to the blast site.\n\n\u201cI was waiting at the entrance of the recruitment centre,\u201d said Mustafa Ghiasi, lying on a hospital bed after being wounded in the explosion. \u201cI was behind two men in line when suddenly the blast struck.\u201d\n\nAt least six people were killed and 14 wounded, according to police and health officials.\n\nThe injured \u201care in good health conditions and those needed operations have been transferred to the operation theatre,\u201d said Haji Khan Zazi of the Afghan Ministry of Public Health.\n\nThe Taliban claimed the two attacks, and a statement issued by a spokesman for the insurgents said they were aimed at security forces.\n\n\u201cPeople were given warning,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cDo not take part in the puppet administration\u2019s election rallies, because all such gatherings are our military target,\u201d said the statement. \u201cIf, despite the warning, someone get hurt, they themselves are to blame.\u201d\n\nSecurity at rallies across the country has been tight following threats by the Taliban to attack meetings and polling stations. The group has vowed to intensify clashes with Afghan and foreign forces to dissuade people from voting in the upcoming elections.\n\nLast week, peace talks between the United States and the Taliban collapsed. The two sides had been seeking to reach an accord on the withdrawal of thousands of American troops from Afghanistan in exchange for security guarantees from the insurgents.\n\nThe negotiations, which did not include the Afghan government, were intended as a prelude to wider peace negotiations to end more than more 40 years of war in Afghanistan.", "description": "Taliban suicide attackers killed at least 30 people in Afghanistan on Tuesday, their deadliest bombing taking place near an election rally by President Ashraf Ghani, although he was unhurt.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430816190&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0UB", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
