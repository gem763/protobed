Joins the line so well, though. 6\n\nAnthony Watson His footwork gave Koroibete a torrid time and was rewarded for his efforts with a try. Commanding under the high ball. 8\n\nHenry Slade Strange one. Notably rusty at times but his kick for May\u2019s second try was the sublime moment of the match. 7\n\nManu Tuilagi It was his tackle that stopped Australia\u2019s early onslaught after 18 phases and his powerful carry that led to May\u2019s first try. 7\n\nJonny May Touched the ball three times in the first half and finished with two tries. Rolled up his sleeves in second half but injured late on. 8\n\nOwen Farrell (capt) What. A. Pass. Nothing \u201cclunky\u201d about this display. Who knew he was an accomplished fly-half? Also flawless from the tee. 9\n\nBen Youngs Much better from the one player England cannot afford to lose. Not a great start but made a clever dart down the left. 7\n\nMako Vunipola Made 18 tackles in his 69 minutes, which is remarkable for someone who had not started a match since May. A great return. 8\n\nJamie George Lineout was not perfect and he gave away one penalty but a player who raises his game when temperature is at its highest. 8\n\nKyle Sinckler Scored a first England try and made a key turnover with his side under the pump. \u201cA runaway rhino,\u201d said Eddie Jones. 8\n\nMaro Itoje Put his head where it hurts. Did not give Genia a moment\u2019s peace and exemplifies the aggressive, powerful nature of this side. 8\n\nCourtney Lawes Put himself about in the first half, softening up opponents so teammates could take full advantage later on. 7\n\nTom Curry Stunning performance from England\u2019s youngest player. Truckloads of tackles and a relentless appetite for work. 9\n\nSam Underhill Whenever Australia\u2019s tails were up, he produced a tackle to give his side a boost. Out on his feet by the end but out of this world. 9\n\nBilly Vunipola He is being well shackled by opponents but kept plugging away. The attention he receives creates space for others. 7\n\nReplacements: Matt Toomua (for Lealiifano, 53) 6, Taniela Tupou (for Alaalatoa, 61) One powerful run 7, Nic White (for Genia, 61) Looked lively 7, Jordan Uelese (for Latu, 66) 6, Adam Coleman (for Arnold, 66) 5, James Slipper (for Sio, 69) n/a, Lukhan Salakaia-Loto (for Naisarani, 69) n/a, James O\u2019Connor (for Petaia, 74) n/a\n\nAustralia\n\nKurtley Beale A couple of loose kicks and his pass was intercepted by Watson. Looked threatening in space but among the most culpable. 5\n\nReece Hodge Wonderful pass to release Koroibete, evading Slade\u2019s rush out of the line, but he will be feeling that hit by Curry for days. 6\n\nJordan Petaia Made seamless transition to outside-centre, brushing off Curry in the opening minutes. Bright future ahead. 7\n\nSamu Kerevi Had some early joy in the first half with his direct running but did not quite have the same impact after half-time. 7\n\nMarika Koroibete Two remarkable solo tries, albeit the second disallowed. Jones set up England to counter his threat but he showed his quality. 7\n\nChristian Lealiifano Conceded one penalty at the breakdown but things got a lot more loose when he went off with Australia chasing the game. 6\n\nWill Genia Brings the curtain down on his international career in disappointing fashion. Struggled to evade attention of Itoje. 5\n\nScott Sio Got the better of Sinckler in early scrum exchanges and made his tackles but his influence waned as the match wore on. 5\n\nTolu Latu Was one of Australia\u2019s busiest forwards at breakdown but could not handle England\u2019s intensity. Was at fault for Sinckler\u2019s try. 5\n\nAllan Alaalatoa His handling error put Wallabies under pressure, handing England a scrum deep in Australia\u2019s 22. A decent tournament nonetheless. 6\n\nIzack Rodda Led way in making life difficult for England in the lineout but there was a gulf in class between the two second-row pairings. 6\n\nRory Arnold The statistics say he carried seven times for no metres, which sums up how hard the Australia forwards found it to make a dent. 6\n\nDavid Pocock The end of a remarkable international career. His poor pass led to May\u2019s second try but got through plenty of work. 6\n\nMichael Hooper (capt) Always involved, made tackles and forced two turnovers. A big decision to go for a scrum under the posts and it did not pay off. 8\n\nIsi Naisarani Will have nightmares of fielding restarts with Underhill charging at him. Wasted one good chance but got through 18 carries. 7\n\nReplacements: Matt Toomua (for Lealiifano, 53) 6, Taniela Tupou (for Alaalatoa, 61) One powerful run 7, Nic White (for Genia, 61) Looked lively 7, Jordan Uelese (for Latu, 66) 6, Adam Coleman (for Arnold, 66) 5, James Slipper (for Sio, 69) n/a, Lukhan Salakaia-Loto (for Naisarani, 69) n/a, James O\u2019Connor (for Petaia, 74) n/a", "description": "Tom Curry produced a relentless display to be man of the match but Tolu Latu could not handle England\u2019s intensity", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de1abfd19cc2aa044c41588e8eff5de3e20c5d48/0_260_3236_1942/master/3236.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cd2922569f61ba9cfd46614c8bf29205", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
