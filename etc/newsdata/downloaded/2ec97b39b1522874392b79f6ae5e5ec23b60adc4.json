It's the largest carbon recovery and sequestration facility in the region,\" al-Kaabi told a conference in London, adding it had a 2.1 million tonnes per year capacity.\n\nQatar has for years been the world's largest LNG producer and exporter. It aims to build a large extension to its sprawling LNG facilities to increase production by 40 percent.\n\nAl-Kaabi, also the chief executive of Qatar Petroleum (QP), said the design of the expansion has taken into account carbon capture and storage.\n\nHe also said QP was looking into using carbon in Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR), which it has been piloting in its oilfields.\n\nEOR improves oil production by pumping gas - in this case, carbon - into a field to increase its depleted pressure.\n\n\"That's a big project. We're building large pipelines across the country ... Maybe 10 years down the road we will have enhanced oil recovery.\"", "description": "Doha commissions storage plant to sequester 5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from its LNG facilities by 2025.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/8/e1826b6609de435e8aae84fbfcdfbcb9_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
