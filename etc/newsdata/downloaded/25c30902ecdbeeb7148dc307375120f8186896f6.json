About 3 out of 4 Democratic voters considering Biden in the primary say that he is the most likely to beat Trump, according to a CBS poll released Monday. Jill Biden, the former vice president's wife, explicitly stated that voters should choose him even if they disagree on some policy points because \"your bottom line is you have to beat Trump.\"\n\nBut many voters who attended the New Hampshire Democratic state convention were skeptical that Biden was the most electable Democrat and remember similar claims being made about party establishment figures stretching back to Walter Mondale in 1984 who were nominated and went on to lose.\n\n\u201cBiden is Hillary Clinton, part two. He\u2019s an establishment candidate,\u201d said Katie Pederson, 28, who works for a call center and for Southern New Hampshire University. \u201cI don\u2019t think Biden could beat Trump.\u201d\n\nGoffstown resident Kathy Ireland, 67, who is retired, shared similar concerns. \u201cI\u2019m not for Biden,\u201d she said. \u201cHe claims to be electable, but I\u2019m not convinced.\u201d In 2016, Democratic nominee Clinton, a policy wonk to the core, had a better chance than Biden at beating Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s not that up on things. He\u2019s not up on issues.\u201d\n\nFor Democrats nationally, Clinton was only the latest in a string of nominees over recent decades who won their nominations on claims of being the most electable, only to flame out against Republican rivals with more personality and passion or easy-to-remember slogans versus Democrats' briefing book approach.\n\nJohn Kerry in 2004 and Al Gore four years earlier fell into that technocratic category. Landslide losers from the Reagan and George H.W. Bush eras still traumatize skeptical New Hampshire voters as well, including Michael Dukakis in 1988 and former Vice President Walter Mondale four years earlier, who won only his home state of Minnesota and the District of Columbia.\n\nIn the case of Biden, previous voter criticism has centered on his age. Biden would be the oldest president ever elected, and his propensity for misstating names and stumbling over his words has called into question whether he can execute the duties of the presidential office. Last month, Biden asked, \"What's not to like about Vermont?\" when he was in New Hampshire and mistook Houston for El Paso, Texas, and Michigan for Ohio when discussing mass shootings in early August.\n\nBut many New Hampshire voters say that Biden's antiquated style of Democratic politics will be a bigger problem than his age. \u201cI hate to say it, he\u2019s old,\u201d said Kit Hansen, another retired Goffstown resident. \u201cI don\u2019t really mean old age. He\u2019s yesterday\u2019s news.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe American people have made it very clear that we want someone who speaks for the people,\u201d Pederson said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the vice president. We don\u2019t want the president\u2019s wife. We don\u2019t want the president\u2019s brother. We\u2019ve told Washington this over and over and over again, and they keep losing.\u201d\n\nDavid McCuan, political science professor at Sonoma State University, told the Washington Examiner that, if anything, Biden lacks some of Clinton's advantages in 2016. \u201cJoe Biden is not exactly starting any fire in terms of momentum or excitement,\u201d McCuan said, and the electability argument \u201cis not going to be sufficient to draw out voters.\u201d\n\nElections in 2020 and 2024 present a transition to an emerging electorate, McCuan said, mentioning younger voters, Hispanic voters, and women. The new electorate \u201cvotes episodically,\u201d but Biden \u201cis talking to regular, habitual voters.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the argument is going to be that you're going to get white working-class voters to your side, that's Joe Biden's argument, you're going to have to look very closely at that data because other core Democratic groups are going to hold back or not show up,\u201d McCuan said.\n\nA challenge that Biden shares with Clinton is on settling on a campaign slogan and theme that sticks. The Biden campaign is \"going to have to roll out his theme or roll out his moniker, whatever it's going to be, more than once,\" McCuan said.", "description": "MANCHESTER, New Hampshire \u2014 Democratic activists in the first primary state worry that if Joe Biden is the party\u2019s presidential nominee, he could lose the 2020 election for some of the same reasons Hillary Clinton was defeated in 2016.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1f78311/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1202+0+61/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2Fbd%2F50%2F0121722a49ec8961ffc2451ec98b%2Fbiden51.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
