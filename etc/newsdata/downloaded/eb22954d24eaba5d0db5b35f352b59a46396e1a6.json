A US tech start-up thinks it has found a solution.\n\nEquivocation is the art of concealing the truth with ambiguities. If the chief executive is working on an \u201cexciting initiative\u201d, employees will fear the worst. If a finance director congratulates an analyst on a \u201cfair question\u201d, the scribbler knows no clear answer will be forthcoming.\n\nEvasive language is becoming a problem for investors who crunch big data sets in search of buy and sell signals. In the past, they focused on numbers. Linguistic analysis is the cool new frontier. Processing wodges of text could be a way of quantifying sentiment and predicting where stock prices are headed.\n\nMorgan Stanley last week published findings after machine-reading 135,000 of its own research notes. The investment bank claimed it found a positive correlation between sentiment in the reports and how shares performed subsequently.\n\nAnalysts might say what they mean \u2013 except, perhaps, when assigning a \u201chold\u201d rating to a stock that is a screaming sell. C-suite bosses can be more slippery.\n\nA US tech start-up thinks it has found a solution. Amenity Analytics has built a website that trawls through transcripts of earnings calls and awards scores to companies meant to show how prone executives are to stonewalling.\n\nBank of America researchers used this database to create a model portfolio of shareholdings in straight-talking businesses and short positions in evasive ones. Adjusted for executive optimism, this beat the market by more than 6 per cent a year in back tests.", "description": "Evasive language is becoming a problem for investors who crunch big data sets in search of buy and sell signals.
