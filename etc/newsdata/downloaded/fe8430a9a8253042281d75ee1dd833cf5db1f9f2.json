Just two games into the season, Manning was far from the worst part of the 0-2 Giants start, but with a first-round pick at quarterback holding a clipboard on the sidelines, the decision was obviously made to go with the future.\n\nThe choice makes sense at a certain point, given that Jones is clearly the future of the franchise \u2013 a team doesn\u2019t take a quarterback sixth overall and have him sit too long. But the Giants made the decision this spring to bring back the 39-year-old Manning for the final year of his contract.\n\nThat decision paved a path that ties the Giants to a $23.2 million hit against the salary cap this year and had a domino effect on their other offseason moves. That is a lot of money for Manning to now become the backup quarterback after just two games.\n\nThe decision to bench Manning so early in the year and essentially wave the white flag on the season is especially risky given that the quarterback\u2019s performance was solid and he was far from a liability on the field. To also bench him after two weeks is compounded by the fact that this offseason, the Giants went into full rebuild mode and didn\u2019t bring back several impact players including two of their young playmakers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Giants made a significant salary cap investment to bring back Manning for what now amounts to just two starts. Had they chosen to move on from the two-time Super Bowl MVP, they could have possibly kept one, if not two of the stars that they jettisoned this offseason.\n\nThe Giants traded away star wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. in March, shipping an All-Pro talent who they had just signed to a massive extension the year before. The Giants also couldn\u2019t bring back another star in safety Landon Collins, who signed in free agency a six-year contract with division rival Washington Redskins. The Giants said he was too expensive to keep, a point Collins backed up by signing a deal with an annual contract value of $14 million.\n\nIf the Giants had decided to cut ties with Manning in the spring, then potentially they could have kept either Beckham or, more likely, Collins. It was a choice to retain Manning that has ramifications beyond this year as the quarterback\u2019s contract tied up money that could have gone toward long-term contracts for younger parts of their core.\n\nManning is in the final year of his contract, which currently eats up just under 10 percent of the Giants entire salary cap.", "description": "After bringing Eli Manning back for the final year of his contract, the New York Giants decision to bench their Pro Bowl quarterback is now a puzzling part of their rebuild.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/eli-manning-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
