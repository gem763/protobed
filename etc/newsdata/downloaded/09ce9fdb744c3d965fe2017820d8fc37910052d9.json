I have a toothbrush and my toothpaste all ready to go laid out by my sink. I just have to brush my teeth and go to the gym,\" she says.\n\nThe small trick, she says, helps her not to stress out in the morning \u2014 and is a time-saver.\n\nWest's trainer's Melissa Alcantara told CNBC Make It in July that she meets West at her home to train her at least five days a week.\n\nWest's mom and manager, Kris Jenner, 63, previously told Poosh.com that her early morning treadmill workouts at home have been one of the keys to her success.\n\nOn most days, Jenner said that she wakes up at around 4:30 a.m. or 5:30 a.m, and the first thing she does is have coffee and check her emails \"real quick\" before hopping on the treadmill. \"If I can be on that treadmill for 45 minutes to an hour, it's golden,\" she said.\n\nWest also tries to do everything in close proximity to her and her husband Kanye West's $60 million Calabasas, California home.\n\n\"I try to keep everything as local as possible,\" says West.\n\nThat saved time allows her to \"make sure that I spend enough time doing the things that I really want to do, like waking my kids up, getting them ready for school, having breakfast with them and dropping them off at school, because those things will keep me sane when I'm overworked,\" West says.\n\nWest says in a perfect world, she would love to go to bed early but with law school, she spends most of her nights reading until around 11 p.m., which means she averages around six hours 45 minutes of sleep a night (slightly below the recommended seven to nine hours).\n\nLike this story?
