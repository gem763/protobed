Mark Sanford of South Carolina, former Rep. Joe Walsh of Illinois, and former Gov. Bill Weld of Massachusetts \u2014 have significantly less name recognition than Trump.\n\nThe poll asked more than 1,100 American adults to select the Republican primary contenders they had ever heard of, in addition to the option of \"I have not heard of any of these people.\" (Six percent of Americans said they had never heard of any 2020 Republican candidates, including Trump.)\n\nEighty-seven percent of overall respondents had heard of Trump \u2014 though the president is unambiguously one of the most well-known people in America, polling isn't compulsory and it's rare to get much higher than 90% on questions like these for even well-known figures. Just one-third of respondents had heard of the next most-recognized candidate, former Rep. Joe Walsh, a conservative radio show host who served one term in the House beginning in 2011.\n\nAmong conservatives polled, Trump's name recognition is even stronger by comparison. Eighty-six percent of respondents who self-identify as \"slightly\" to \"very\" conservative said they had heard of Trump, compared to 30.1% recognition for the next most well-known candidate, former Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina, whose campaign is focused on bringing down the national debt.\n\nTwenty-nine percent of conservative respondents had heard of former Rep. Joe Walsh, and only 18% said they had heard of former Gov. Bill Weld.\n\nWhile the forecast may not look favorable for Trump's competitors, a sizable contingent of Republicans haven't dismissed the prospect of a qualified opponent. An Insider poll conducted in April found that 42% of right-leaning respondents are open to considering another qualified Republican candidate, and a quarter would even support a challenger over Trump.\n\nNonetheless, Gallup polls have shown that Trump's approval rating has consistently hovered around a staggering 90% among Republicans throughout 2019 \u2014 and sitting presidents rarely lose their party's nomination for a second term.\n\nOn Tuesday, two will face off in the first GOP primary debate of the race, hosted by Business Insider. If they can raise their profiles enough to capture the attention of the conservative factions who are on the fence about Trump, they might just stand a chance of posing a credible threat.\n\nSurveyMonkey Audience polls from a national sample balanced by census data of age and gender.
