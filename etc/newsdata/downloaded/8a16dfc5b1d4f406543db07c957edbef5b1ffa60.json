Says the site: \u201cDr. Hill\u2019s work with the League of the South has been featured in The Washington Post, The New York Review of Books, The Journal of Higher Education, The Mobile Register, The Village Voice, The Atlanta Journal and Constitution, The Wall Street Journal, The Nashville Tennessean, The State (Columbia, SC), and many, many other publications. Dr. Hill is a frequent guest on television and radio talk shows and has recently appeared on both BBC Television and Fox News on behalf of the League.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIndeed, Hill\u2019s media appearances are numerous, and major news networks give the secession promoter relatively positive press, considering he openly advocates for the enslavement of black people and armed insurrection against the U.S. government. Hill is often invited to news shows to offer a positive perspective on the Confederate flag.\n\nHill recently told the Christian Science Monitor that the Confederate Flag was \u201ca symbol against tyranny, it\u2019s the internationally recognized symbol of the South, it\u2019s a Christian symbol. It\u2019s a solemn banner.\u201d\n\nHe told a local media outlet in Alabama that the Confederate flag \u201cis near and dear to the hearts of southerners and it\u2019s really shameful that people take symbols like that and attach them to their own personal cause or beliefs.\u201d\n\nCNN writes that Hill considers \u201crace war\u201d to be \u201ca bad idea for negroes\u201d before offering a gentler spin on the leader of perhaps the most visible neo-Confederate organization in the United States. \u201cHis group doesn\u2019t want violence,\u201d CNN paraphrases Hill, before quoting him: \u201cWe Southern nationalists want to live in peace with all men, as far as that is possible.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile big name outlets equivocate about the pros and cons of Michael Hill\u2019s views on the Confederate flag, he is hard at work advancing overt racism in American society.\n\nWhat follows are only a few of examples of Hill\u2019s recent tweets, where he describes himself simply as, \u201cPresident, League of the South.\u201d According to his profile on the social media site, Hill lives in Killen, Alabama.\n\n\u201c\u2018White supremacy\u2019 is merely a fact of life, Hill wrote on Sunday, \u201cprovable by a glance at history. To end it, you\u2019ll have to destroy the white race.\u201d On Twitter, Hill regularly spews hateful rhetoric against people who are not white, making occasional time to disparage other groups of people, including gay Republicans, who Hill refers to as \u201cRainbow Confederates.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn June 12, Hill explained his modus operandi in talking to media outlets. \u201cIf [you] have to say \u2018but I\u2019m not a racist,\u2019 then the Left has already beaten you,\u201d Hill wrote on Twitter. \u201cJust say, \u2018OK, I\u2019m a racist. So what?\u2019 That confuses them.\u201d\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MichaelHill51/status/618061045119197189\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MichaelHill51/status/617855451233959937\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MichaelHill51/status/617850698974273536\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MichaelHill51/status/617352180605935616\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MichaelHill51/status/616794185564160000\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MichaelHill51/status/616782817129697280\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MichaelHill51/status/614938599880916992\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MichaelHill51/status/614825288875184128\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MichaelHill51/status/614241531038298112\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MichaelHill51/status/614113268177743872\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MichaelHill51/status/612336533098467328\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MichaelHill51/status/609481146380914689\n\nChillingly, on June 27, Hill retweeted the following statement, which calls for physical violence against opponents of white supremacy:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nhttps://twitter.com/AvengingRedHand/status/614930628920766464", "description": "", "authors": ["Joan Shipps", "Bob Brigham"], "top_image": "https://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-06-at-12.19.33-PM.jpg", "published_at": "2015-07-06"}
