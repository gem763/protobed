The current ban was due to expire on September 30.\n\nThe German government introduced a ban in response to the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year. Under the policy, no new arms deal can be agreed with the kingdom and deliveries under existing contracts should be suspended.\n\nThe move comes just days after the boss of Airbus warned that a continued ban was \"very damaging\" to Germany's reputation. Guillaume Faury told POLITICO that continued uncertainty undermined defense programs.\n\nBoth France and the U.K. have voiced opposition to the export ban, but Germany has so far rebuffed criticism.", "description": "Decision comes despite warnings arms export ban could undermine trust in Germany.", "authors": ["Joshua Posaner"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-154785347-1200x628.jpg"}
