The tweet came after an explosive meeting on infrastructure between Trump and Democrats the day before, which the president walked out of.\n\n\u201cTheir heart is not into Infrastructure, lower drug prices, pre-existing conditions and our great Vets,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cAll they are geared up to do, six committees, is squander time, day after day, trying to find anything which will be bad for me.\u201d\n\n....drug prices, pre-existing conditions and our great Vets. All they are geared up to do, six committees, is squander time, day after day, trying to find anything which will be bad for me. A pure fishing expedition like this never happened before, & it should never happen again! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 23, 2019\n\nTrump is objectively wrong; House Democrats haven\u2019t been squandering time. In addition to their investigations, they\u2019ve been passing legislation at a rapid clip. In all, the House has taken up 51 bills, resolutions, and suspensions since January \u2014 49 of which they\u2019ve passed. This includes a slate of bills to attempt to end the longest government shutdown in history, the result of a protracted fight between Trump and Congress over border wall funding.\n\nIronically, over the past two weeks, the House has passed bills to address most of the issues Trump mentioned in his tweet. They recently passed a bill to lower prescription drug prices, and another one to protect preexisting conditions. The House also passed nine bills on veterans issues this week alone, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi noted at her weekly press conference. On Thursday, Democrats tried to present Trump their infrastructure plan before he walked out of their meeting.\n\nSo if the House is passing all these bills, why does it seem like Congress isn\u2019t getting anything done? Welcome to the reality of divided government in Washington. The vast majority of House Democrats\u2019 agenda has hit a dead end in the Republican-controlled Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has dubbed himself the \u201cgrim reaper\u201d of Democratic legislation. Pelosi has blasted the Senate leader for embracing this role, saying he\u2019s working for special interests in Washington, rather than the people of the United States.\n\n\u201cThe Senate is the graveyard where bills that pass in the Congress, that have bipartisan support in the country, go to die,\u201d Pelosi said at a recent press conference.\n\nLittle is happening in Congress, but it\u2019s not for Democrats\u2019 lack of trying\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s declaration that it\u2019s impossible for Democrats to \u201cinvestigate and legislate at the same time,\u201d House Democrats have been doing a lot of legislating over the past few months.\n\nBut Trump isn\u2019t the only one with a perception that very little is happening in Congress. Congress\u2019s approval rating is a dismal 20 percent, with 77 percent disapproval, according to Gallup. There\u2019s a pervasive sense of legislative paralysis on Capitol Hill.\n\nEven when the House of Representatives was controlled by Republicans in 2017 and 2018, the two major legislative accomplishments McConnell, Trump, and House Speaker Paul Ryan had were a massive GOP tax cut and a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill in 2018. Since Democrats took control of the House, the few things they\u2019ve been able to agree with Senate Republicans on include a bill to reopen the federal government after three weeks, a resolution to end US involvement in the war in Yemen (vetoed by Trump), and the recent disaster aid agreement (which isn\u2019t finalized, as one House GOP lawmaker has held it up).\n\nStill, there\u2019s little policymaking in the Senate, where McConnell has mostly been focused on confirming nominations to the judiciary and Trump\u2019s Cabinet.\n\n\u201cThe one really cool legislature is now gone,\u201d said Josh Huder, a senior fellow at Georgetown University\u2019s Government Affairs Institute. \u201cIf you\u2019re really interested in confirming judges, it\u2019s the place to be.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s so rare the Senate votes on a bill that Roll Call reporter Niels Lesniewski tweeted an alert when members took up the TRACED Act on Thursday, a bipartisan bill to tack on heavy penalties for robocalls.\n\nThe Senate is voting on legislation. \u2014 Niels Lesniewski (@nielslesniewski) May 23, 2019\n\nA few hours later, the House and Senate struck a long-awaited deal on disaster aid to help areas of the United States devastated by flooding and deadly storms. But besides that and passing another budget deal, there\u2019s little hope that both sides of the aisle will agree on something between now and the 2020 election.\n\nThere\u2019s a clear political strategy to McConnell not working with Pelosi on her agenda. He\u2019s staring down 2020, where Senate Republicans are defending more seats than Democrats. Plus he has his own seat in Kentucky to worry about (though McConnell losing that is unlikely). No matter what, there\u2019s little incentive for McConnell to hand Democrats any legislative wins.\n\nThat has lent itself to a sense of legislative paralysis on Capitol Hill. In the upper chamber, there\u2019s a perception that the power of individual senators to filibuster bills or introduce legislation has diminished. It\u2019s a dynamic that\u2019s visible in the fact many high-profile potential Senate candidates like Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams have declined a Senate bid this year, opting instead to run for president or mull another gubernatorial bid.\n\nMuch of the media focus these days is on Democrats\u2019 investigations, rather than their legislation, because that\u2019s where the action is. Trump\u2019s attempts to thwart these investigations have turned into what Pelosi and some of her committee chairs have dubbed a constitutional crisis. But even though Washington is consumed with investigations news, it doesn\u2019t mean policy work isn\u2019t happening. It just means it isn\u2019t getting talked about as much.\n\nHere\u2019s a list of bills the House has passed since January\n\nHouse Democrats have passed a wide range of bills since they came to power in January, ranging from a sweeping anti-corruption and pro-democracy reform known as HR 1, to bills to save net neutrality, establish background checks for guns, and put the United States back in the Paris Climate Accord.\n\nThey have also put a large emphasis on health care, a defining issue of the 2018 election after Trump and Senate Republicans attempted to pass a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Democrats have focused on bills to lower prescription drug costs, protect preexisting conditions, and condemning the Trump administration\u2019s legal battle to strike down the ACA in the courts.\n\nMuch of this agenda is sitting in the Senate. The few things House Democrats and Senate Republicans have agreed on: disaster relief aid, reopening the government after the shutdown, the resolution to end US involvement in the Yemen war, a bill to protect public lands, and a resolution disapproving of Trump\u2019s use of emergency powers.\n\nBut on major policy issues \u2014 like health care and infrastructure, or even bipartisan ones like net neutrality or the Equal Pay Act \u2014 Democrats\u2019 bills are continuing to languish in the Senate.
