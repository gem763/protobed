But Mr. Pompeo said there was no evidence the strikes had come from Yemen.\n\nIn a tweet, he said the U.S. will work with allies \u201cto ensure that energy markets remain well supplied and Iran is held accountable for its aggression.\u201d He added that the strikes showed Iran wasn\u2019t serious about diplomacy.\n\nMr. Pompeo didn\u2019t explain how the U.S. believes Iran was to blame or where the strikes originated, but Iran-backed militias in Iraq have previously been responsible for targeting Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil industry. Meanwhile, Saudi and American officials are investigating the possibility that attacks on Saudi oil facilities Saturday involved cruise missiles launched from Iraq or Iran.\n\nThe production shutdown amounts to a loss of about 5.7 million barrels a day, the kingdom\u2019s national oil company said, roughly 5% of the world\u2019s daily production of crude oil.", "description": "", "authors": ["Wsj.Com Articles"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
