It added up to a 24-21 victory that gives the Raiders (3-2) a winning record after five games for just the third time since the team went to the Super Bowl following the 2002 season.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve been talking about our young players since they\u2019ve been here, the kind of effort that they provide and the smartness that they play with,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cAnd these are smart guys that are doing a lot of different things.\u201d\n\nThe most notable to the young stars was running back Josh Jacobs, who ran for 123 yards and two TDs against one of the league\u2019s most dominant defensive fronts led by former Raiders star Khalil Mack.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been building the run game every week,\u201d second-year left tackle Kolton Miller said. \u201cWe really took this challenge personally that Chicago has the best defense in the league, nobody has been able to run the rock on them. But we stepped up to that challenge and we took it.\u201d\n\nMiller did a good job keeping Mack away from Carr, holding him to no sacks and only one quarterback hit and a young defensive front shut down Chicago\u2019s running game and sacked Chase Daniel four times.\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nRunning game. Gruden has built his offense around the running game and it\u2019s paying off now that he has a featured back. Jacobs overcame a mistake that led to a fumble in the third quarter to have his best game yet as a pro. He ran hard all game, breaking tackles and avoiding them and has shown a knack for the end zone with Marcus Allen-style leaps into the end zone. He has 430 yards rushing and four TDs through five games.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nWide receivers. With starters Tyrell Williams and J.J. Nelson out with injuries, the Raiders didn\u2019t get much production from their wideouts. The unproven group combined for seven catches for 65 yards and Trevor Davis lost a fumble at the goal line in the fourth quarter. Getting healthy should go a long way to improving that group.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nMiller. A rough rookie season had many outsiders questioning Oakland\u2019s decision to draft Miller in the first round as he often got overwhelmed by stronger pass rushers. But he has been much improved in year two, shutting down Denver\u2019s Bradley Chubb in the opener and then neutralizing Khalil Mack against Chicago. He got help from tight ends, backs and quick passes, but Miller fared well when he was left on his own as well.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a stud,\u201d teammate Richie Incognito said. \u201cHe\u2019s playing really well. Any time you shut a guy out like Khalil Mack, that\u2019s something to hang your hat on.\u201d\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nPunt coverage. The Raiders have little margin for error so allowing big plays on special teams can be especially costly. Chicago\u2019s third-quarter comeback was fueled in part by a 71-yard punt return from Tarik Cohen that set up the go-ahead score.\n\nINJURED\n\nThe Raiders hope to be much healthier when they return from their bye. Starting right guard Gabe Jackson is expected to return from a knee injury that has sidelined him since training camp and Williams (foot), Nelson (knee), DE Clelin Ferrell (concussion) and return specialist Dwayne Harris (ankle) all hoping to get back as well.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n4. After two straight games without a sack, Oakland\u2019s much-maligned defensive front delivered four against the Bears. That\u2019s the most for the team since 2017 when Mack was still coming off the edge. Second-year tackle Maurice Hurst had two, rookie Maxx Crosby added one and veteran Benson Mayowa added another to give him 4\u00bd for the season - more than anyone on the team had all of last year.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe Raiders get a well-deserved week off after spending the week in London. Their 48-day stretch without a game in Oakland continues on Oct. 20 when the Raiders visit Green Bay.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Maybe it took a week in England for coach Jon Gruden's vision for the type of team he wants the Oakland Raiders to become to materialize.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Josh Dubow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/bears_raiders_football_28819_c0-113-2717-1697_s1770x1032.jpg?012afb0ca7286348d036aa89af418b257f9a8495", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
