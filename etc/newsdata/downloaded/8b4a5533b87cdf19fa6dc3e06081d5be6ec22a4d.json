Thousands of workers had toiled for months to erect massive gilded tent cities to house each of the royal delegations and the events\u2014feasts, tournaments, and other revelry\u2014that they would host.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of booming cannons, the two mounted men appeared on either side of the field\u2014King Henry VIII of England and King Francis I of France.", "description": "The Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520 was arranged as an 18-day celebration to solidify a new era of peace between England and France.
