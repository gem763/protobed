Which is why we have \u200bPeople\u2019s Choice\u200b, in which we find the best-reviewed products and single out the most convincing ones. (You can learn more about our rating system and how we pick each item \u200bhere\u200b.)\n\nAnd while we\u2019ve written about lots of sheets \u2014 including the best expert-recommended sheets, the best hotel-style sheets , and the best Egyptian-sheets \u2014 here, we\u2019ve rounded up the best sheets, as praised by the most enthusiastic reviewers on Amazon. To even the playing field a bit, we focused on queen-size sheets, but many of these sheets are available in other sizes as well.\n\nBest-rated sheets\n\nMellanni Bed Sheet Set \u2014 Brushed Microfiber 1800 Bedding 4.4 stars, 60,997 reviews More than 22,000 reviewers said that these sheets were soft and comfortable. But one guy who considered his review more of a performance piece said this: \u201cLike sleeping on the fluffy belly of a swan while smoothly gliding through a whirlwind of silk fibers accented with soft whispers of \u2018good investment, bro\u2019 from the sweet lips of the goddess of naps, this is a pretty dope upgrade from college student-grade bed sheets.\u201d Another describes the sheets as being like the \u201csoft, cotton sheets you might remember as a youngster, that had softened to perfection after having been run through the washer dozens of times; except these have this feel right out of the package.\u201d One reviewer, after casually referencing being used to sleeping on Frette sheets, says, \u201csoft is an understatement.\u201d And they stay that way. \u201cNo pilling yet, they wash nicely and dry quickly,\u201d says another review. \u201cThese have shown no sign of ripping yet and we have used them every day for the past year.\u201d If you still need convincing, designer Ashley Moore told us that she has these \u201csupersoft\u201d sheets \u201cin every guest bedroom in our home.\u201d $25 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe best-rated (less expensive) sheets\n\nUtopia Bedding 4-Piece Queen Bed Sheets Set $17 (was $19, now 11% off) 4.3 stars, 8,848 reviews \u201cHonestly, I have no idea how these are made and sold so inexpensively but you won\u2019t hear me complain!\u201d says one customer who, like nearly 45 percent of the reviews for these sheets, notes their softness. They \u201ctruly feel like velvet,\u201d the reviewer says. Plus, \u201cthey fit the bed perfectly.\u201d Although the reviewer does point out that these sheets are thin, they are \u201cperfect for warm climates\u201d and \u201cnot so thin you can see through them.\u201d Another reviewer appreciates that thinness, which means the sheets don\u2019t \u201cinterfere with the cooling properties of my mattress.\u201d They\u2019re wrinkle-free, too. \u201cI do not iron my sheets,\u201d a reviewer says. \u201cAnd you could not tell that I don\u2019t with these.\u201d $17 at Amazon Buy\n\nAnd now for some micro-picks of every type of bed sheet you might be looking for.\n\nBest sheets for cold sleepers\n\nQueen Size Sheet Set - 6 Piece Set - Hotel Luxury Bed Sheets 4.2 stars, 11,088 reviews If you\u2019re the kind of person who can never have too many blankets, you\u2019ll like these sheets. According to one reviewer, \u201ceven though [the sheets] are not flannel, they have kept us warm and we have not had to start using two quilts yet, which we usually do in the winter. The sheets themselves are probably the most comfortable sheets we have slept on.\u201d Another reviewer says, \u201cthey are nice and warm \u2014 but light in weight \u2014 so I don\u2019t feel smothered like some [heavier] ones I have had.\u201d One reviewer had these sheets recommended to her by a \u201cself proclaimed \u2018sheet snob\u2019 coworker.\u201d She says, \u201cI felt like I was crawling into a butter dish!\u201d $32 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest sheets for hot sleepers\n\nAmazonBasics Light-Weight Microfiber Sheet Set 4.3 stars, 22,490 reviews This sheet set was popular among warm-climate users. \u201cI wanted some lightweight sheets that were good for hot summer nights, and these really fit the bill,\u201d one reviewer writes. \u201cI live in Florida, so even at night it can get incredibly humid and hot here,\u201d says another. The sheets keep you cool, but not cold, a few reviewers point out. According to one customer, \u201cYou don\u2019t sweat but you\u2019re not cold.\u201d And they last. \u201cAlthough they\u2019re lightweight, they\u2019re not flimsy sheets,\u201d says one reviewer. \u201cI\u2019ve followed the package\u2019s washing instructions, and they\u2019ve held up very well through several washings now; the stitching is still sound and intact.\u201d $20 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest 400-thread-count 100 percent cotton sheets\n\nCalifornia Design Den 400-Thread-Count, 100% Cotton Sheets $35 (was $48, now 27% off) 4.5 stars, 6,327 reviews More than 15 percent of reviewers comment on how much they love that these sheets are 100 percent cotton. \u201cThey feel like what a quality cotton sheet set should; its not sateen or silky, not fleece, it\u2019s a well made, lasting cotton sheet set,\u201d says one reviewer. Many describe the feeling as \u201ccrisp yet soft,\u201d and mention that material doesn\u2019t make them overheat. \u201cBeing cotton,\u201d one says, \u201cthe fabric keeps me much cooler at night than synthetics.\u201d While reviewers admit that the sheets \u201cdo wrinkle,\u201d they\u2019re worth it. \u201cIt\u2019s 100% cotton,\u201d one says. \u201cWrinkles are the price you pay for cottony comfort.\u201d $35 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest 600-thread-count 100 percent cotton sheets\n\n600-Thread-Count Best 100% Cotton Sheets & Pillowcases Set 4.5 stars, 2,099 reviews Great sheets, especially if you follow the instructions. \u201cAfter washing them according to the directions,\u201d one says, \u201cthey came out very soft and not as wrinkled as other 100% cotton sheets that I have.\u201d Another describes the feeling as \u201cultra soft and silky\u201d and \u201cbreathable and cool to touch.\u201d They made a different reviewer nostalgic. \u201cThey are strong, soft, and like the sheets my mother used when I was growing up and cotton was the only kind of sheet available,\u201d they note adding that \u201cthose sheets [were] handed down from my grandmothers and lasted foreverrrrrrr.\u201d Unlike those sheets, however, these have some modern upgrades: They hold up to machine washing and include a \u201clabel at the foot of the fitted sheet so I know exactly which side goes where.\u201d $50 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest brushed microfiber sheets\n\nMezzati Luxury Bed Sheet Set 4.3 stars, 6,404 reviews One reviewer says if you\u2019ve been tricked by \u201ccrappy-sheet-lover reviews before\u2026THESE ARE NOT THOSE SHEETS.\u201d They add, \u201cThese sheets wash well, dry well, are soft without the microfiber static cling, they don\u2019t pill and (I stuck with white) haven\u2019t changed color.\u201d The product description claims brushed microfiber is softer and longer-lasting than cotton, which these five-star reviewers can attest to: \u201cThey are INCREDIBLY SOFT \u2014 softer than my Egyptian cotton,\u201d one writes. Another says, \u201cit has been 4 years of using and washing these sheets and I have to say they are still holding up amazing.\u201d One customer even says they are so great that they have to defend themselves against their kids who now want to sleep in the bed: \u201cIf I go away I\u2019m going to put the uncomfortable sheets on.\u201d $29 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest flannel sheets\n\nPinzon Signature Cotton Heavyweight Velvet Flannel Sheet Set 4.7 stars, 4,594 reviews \u201cThese are the thickest flannel sheets I have bought; thicker than Pointehaven, thicker than the overrated Eddie Bauer sheets, and thicker than any of several \u2018premium\u2019 sets from a place that sounds something like StockOver,\u201d one not-at-all-still-angry reviewer writes. Another says, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me how much better these flannel sheets are than the others I\u2019ve been disappointed by. They haven\u2019t pilled, shrunk, faded, or stunk.\u201d According to one customer, \u201cthey really are heavyweight (very warm in winter months), smooth, non-pilling, and oh-so-very-very soft. I\u2019m almost tempted to leave them on the bed year round they\u2019re so comfortable.\u201d Leave the sheets on, encourages another customer: \u201cIn the summer months they actually keep us relatively cool and don\u2019t overheat us.\u201d $51 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest jersey sheets\n\nAmazonBasics Heather Jersey Sheet Set 4.5 stars, 1,659 reviews These sheets have won over the hearts of both jersey knit fans and foes. \u201cI am a total jersey knit sheet snob \u2014 and I absolutely love these,\u201d one reviewer writes. \u201cExcellent quality, and a very nice weight to them \u2014 not flimsy and thin, but just right.\u201d An initially skeptical reviewer says, \u201cLet\u2019s start with I have always HATED jersey sheets. I tried these on a frustrated whim one day. They are marvelous. They are super soft, they don\u2019t pill, they hold their shape and they are cut properly so they don\u2019t wind up in the weird parallelogram shape so many jersey sheets do.\u201d Another describes the feeling of sleeping in these sheets as \u201c being wrapped in a super soft stretchy oversized t-shirt.\u201d Plus, another says, \u201cthey wash and dry beautifully, they don\u2019t wrinkle, and they fit my queen-size mattress like a glove.\u201d $40 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest sheets with deep pockets\n\nHotel Luxury Bed Sheets Set- 1800 Series Platinum Collection-Deep Pocket 4.2 stars, 23,276 reviews Hundreds of reviewers comment on just how deep these deep-pocket sheets are. One says it had \u201cno problem fitting the 11\u201d thick mattress\u201d while another notes, \u201cThey fit our 13-14 inch mattress with ease.\u201d And it\u2019s not just the fitted sheets that makes reviewers happy: \u201cfor once the top sheet is big enough,\u201d says one customer. Overall, reviewers are also impressed by the feel, saying that the hotel label is more than just a name. One says the sheets are so comfortable that they\u2019ll never share their bed again: \u201cThere will be no \u2018one nighters\u2019 as I will never take the chance of anyone enjoying the vast comfort of my bed now only described as the clouds and never leaving.\u201d $28 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest extra-deep pocket sheets\n\nExtra Deep Pocket Sheets 4.6 stars, 2,710 reviews \u201cI\u2019ve got a 16.5-inch mattress,\u201d one reviewer says. \u201c It\u2019s a talalay/natural memory foam over pocket coils eurotop style. The top is thiccc (yes, with 3 C\u2019s) and quite soft so most sheets will slip off after just 2 or 3 nights of sleeping. Not these. In fact, they\u2019re slightly too big and I get a few wrinkles in them when I\u2019ve been laying on it for a while.\u201d These sheets are so deep-pocket, they even fit this reviewer\u2019s princess-and-the-pea setup: \u201cMy husband and I recently put a 4 inch mattress pad on our already huge mattress (which now makes it almost 20 inches),\u201d she says. She bought these sheets after trying 6 more-expensive name brand options. \u201cThey are extremely soft, great quality (despite all of the negative reviews I read), not hot at all, and they stay ON the bed.\u201d $40 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest sheets for an adjustable bed\n\nBare Home Queen Sheet Set 4.5 stars, 6,906 reviews \u201cThose of you with motorized beds know what I mean,\u201d one reviewer writes. \u201cOur old, much more costly sheets, from a well known department store, were forever popping off at the top corners when we adjusted our beds. Well, guess what? These sheets stay put! This feature is more than worth the money to me.\u201d Another says, \u201cThe fitted sheet stays where it should while using the adjustable base of our bed and through the night with frequent tossing and turning.\u201d Others say they feel good all year round, and they wear well. \u201cThe Bare Home sheets feel great, in summer and winter and most important they stay tucked in all around because of the deeper pockets and elastic all around,\u201d one reviewer says. According to another, the sheets are \u201cvery soft and durable, hold up to multiple washes with no issues.\u201d $30 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest sheets with extra pillow cases\n\nDanjor Linens 6 Piece Hotel Luxury Soft 1800 Series Premium Bed Sheets Set 4.3 stars, 6,394 reviews One reviewer describes the perfect balance of these sheets: \u201cThe coolness of \u2018percale\u2019 and the softness of \u2018microfiber.\u2019\u201d Dozens say these are great for anyone who sleeps hot. \u201cI have slept a couple of nights on these sheets and I have not sweat or been overheated at all,\u201d one writes. Another says they are \u201cnot waking up sweating or getting too hot like I was with old sheets.\u201d This cool set of sheets also comes with two extra pillow cases, which reviewers appreciate. One parent, who \u201cdeeply\u201d appreciates the extra cases because \u201cI have girls\u2026..they have, like 80 pillows on their beds,\u201d also likes that the cases have a secure flap feature. \u201cIt\u2019s a something that luxury sheet sets sometimes have, but not always,\u201d they explain. \u201cIt\u2019s a feature I LOVE! It\u2019s basically an extra flap of material that is folded over at the opening of the pillowcase and sewn in so that once the pillow is in the case, you tuck it into this flap of fabric and it prevents the pillow from sliding out of the pillow case.\u201d $28 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest long-lasting sheets\n\n1500 Supreme Collection Extra Soft Queen Sheets Set 4.4 stars, 35,871 reviews Reviewers love how soft these sheets are. \u201cThis fabric reminds me of very worn high thread count cotton\u2026and I mean that in a good way,\u201d one says. \u201cThey are ridiculously soft while at the same time very tightly woven.\u201d The tight weave might contribute to how well these hold up, which many reviewers comment on. \u201cYou would think for the price they would pill or become frayed but they are just as nice as when i bought the first set,\u201d says one reviewer, who now owns six sets. Another user, who has been using them for five years in their Airbnb, says guests \u201cthink they are high end hotel quality sheets and are stunned when I tell them they\u2019re very inexpensive sheets you can buy off Amazon.\u201d $18 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest wrinkle-free sheets\n\nQueen Size Sheet Set 4.3 stars, 9,359 reviews \u201cThey come out of the [dryer] with no wrinkles!\u201d one reviewer writes. And that\u2019s true no matter how long it\u2019s been since you dried them. \u201cWhen they say wrinkle free they mean it,\u201d another reviewer says. \u201cNot one wrinkle even after sitting for 2 days.\u201d According to one reviewer, \u201cthe deep pockets on the fitted sheet are a HUGE deal, as most fitted sheets tend to bunch up the side of my mattress and get the material all bunched and wrinkled in the middle when I sleep.\u201d $30 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
