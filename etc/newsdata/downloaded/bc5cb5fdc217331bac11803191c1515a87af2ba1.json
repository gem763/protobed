The title is a reference to a comment apparently made to Field Marshall Montgomery stating that the mission might fail, saying 'I think we may be going a bridge too far.'\n\nTo mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Arnhem, which was at the vanguard of the Allied operation, many of those involved were invited guests to watch the Eredivisie game between Vitesse and Fortuna Sittard on Saturday night.\n\nAfter treating them to a 4-2 victory, Vitesse captain Bryan Linssen, who scored twice, ran into the crowd to present a veteran with his shirt.\n\nHe took off the jersey and handed it to the former soldier before Linssen also removed his captain's armband and slid it onto the veteran's arm.\n\nThe pair then exchanged a few words before posing for pictures in front of the celebratory crowd at the GelreDome.\n\nSpeaking about the celebration, Linssen said: 'It's very special and nice that we have been able to honour these veterans this way.\n\n'They have done a lot for all of us in the Netherlands. Chapeau! I thanked him for everything he's done for us.'\n\nFans unfurled a huge banner that depicted five paratroopers landing next to a bridge\n\nA soldier also abseiled from one area of the stadium down to pitch level before the game\n\nA group of academy players were stood in a V as the teams made their way out onto the pitch\n\nIt replicated a scene from a match against Ajax in 1942 when players stood in a V to pay homage Winston Churchill's famous 'V for Victory' gesture during World War II\n\nLinssen's gesture was just one of many things that the club had planned to mark the occasion.\n\nFans also unfurled a huge banner behind one goal that depicted paratroopers landing next to a bridge to symbolise the operation.\n\nA soldier also abseiled from one area of the stadium down to pitch level and the veterans were also cheered by the crowd of thousands by the side of the pitch before the game started.\n\nA group of Vitesse academy players were also stood in a V as the teams made their way out onto the pitch. This was to replicate a scene from a match against Ajax in 1942 when players also stood in a V to pay homage to the 'V for Victory' gesture that Winston Churchill made with his fingers during World War II.\n\nVitesse scored three times in the final 10 minutes to secure all three points. They are now up to third in the Eredivisie table behind Ajax and PSV Eindhoven.", "description": "The captain of Dutch team Vitesse made a touching tribute to an Operation Market Garden veteran on Saturday night to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Arnhem.", "authors": ["Max Winters For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/23/10/18816610-0-image-a-18_1569230753100.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
