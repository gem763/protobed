But it is leaning toward keeping monetary policy steady as stable markets, a truce in U.S.-China trade talks and robust domestic demand give it room to save its dwindling ammunition, sources have told Reuters.", "description": "Tokyo inflation remains stagnant after Japan's October sales tax hike", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9S003_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
