Gavin Newsom on Monday authorizes pharmacists who've undergone special training to provide full courses of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to people who may have come into contact with HIV and 30- to 60-day courses of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which people at high risk of contracting HIV can take daily.\n\n\"All Californians deserve access to PrEP and PEP,\" Newsom said in a statement. \"I applaud the legislature for taking action to expand access to these treatments and getting us close to ending HIV and AIDS for good.\"\n\nSen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, who wrote the bill, called it \"first-in-the-nation\" legislation and said he expected it would help curtail transmissions of HIV when it goes into effect in July 2020. He said he plans to watch closely as the state pharmacy board prepares to roll out the policy and would continue working to expand access to medications that prevent the spread of HIV.\n\nSyphilis continues to rise: A preventable disease is killing newborns in ever-increasing numbers\n\nAs the bill made it through the Legislature, Wiener said, it faced opposition from Kaiser and physician groups such as the California Medical Association, which worried about the safety of shifting the power to determining whether people need medications and blood work from doctors to pharmacists.\n\nPrEP and PEP are covered by most private insurance programs, as well as by Medicare, Medi-Cal and Covered California health plans.\n\n\"Allowing pharmacists to dispense pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis without a prescription is not a safe or effective way to expand access,\" the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in September.\n\n\"The success of these treatments relies heavily on medication adherence and follow-up care by a health care provider,\" the group wrote to members of the state Assembly in opposition to the bill.\n\n'Queer Eye' star is HIV-positive: Jonathan Van Ness reveals he's HIV-positive, opens up about sexual abuse in memoir\n\nKaiser and the physician lobbies dropped their opposition before the bill reached Newsom's desk.\n\nIn a interview with The Desert Sun in February, Wiener said allowing pharmacists to furnish PrEP and PEP could help people without easy access to doctors in rural communities and communities of color.\n\n\u201cNot everyone wants to go see a doctor; They either don\u2019t have a primary care physician, don\u2019t know where to go, or it might take them months to get an appointment,\" he said.\n\nThe final version of the bill requires patients to seek prescriptions from physicians after their initial pharmacist-provided PrEP or PEP regimen.\n\n\u201cTo end new HIV infections, we must dramatically expand access to PrEP and PEP, yet far too many Californians who need these drugs struggle to access them,\" Wiener said.\n\nStudies show gay and bisexual men remain disproportionately at risk for HIV. In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that men who have sex with men accounted for two-thirds of new HIV diagnoses. That year, California's Department of Public Health estimated 220,000 to 240,000 Californians could benefit from PrEP but found that 9,000, or less than 4%, take the drug.\n\nLaura Dunn is a store manager at a Walgreens next to the Desert AIDS Project where Truvada is commonly prescribed. More\n\nActivists hope expanding access to PrEP will lower the number of diagnoses in communities where the incidence of HIV remains high. In 2016, CDC data showed Latino men were almost twice as likely to contract HIV as white men, and black men were more than three times as likely.\n\nEquality California Director Rick Zbur said Newsom signing the bill is \"a giant step\" toward ending transmissions and HIV-related deaths.", "description": "Starting in July 2020, you can access PrEP and PEP from specially trained pharmacists without a doctor's prescription.", "authors": ["Sam Metz", "Palm Springs Desert Sun"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/f4NlCd4H6T6nXUThaCXu0Q--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/ee98a632d7c2d9db613c84bcf58070f8", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
