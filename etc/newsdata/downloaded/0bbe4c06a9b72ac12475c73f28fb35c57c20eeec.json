(AP) - The Purdue University trustees have approved a policy banning faculty, staff and non-athlete students from gambling on sporting events involving any Purdue teams, coaches or student-athletes.\n\nThe policy approved Thursday was developed at the urging of some faculty members and the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics after sports betting became legal in Indiana earlier this year. The policy applies to wagers placed worldwide and online.\n\nTrustee Mike Berghoff said campus leaders weren\u2019t comfortable with the idea that the campus community could now legally bet on student-athletes in their classrooms and dormitories.\n\nFaculty and staff violators of the rule would face discipline up to and including termination. Sanctioning guidelines for non-athlete student violators haven\u2019t been set yet.\n\nNCAA rules already prohibit wagering by certain officials of a university, student-athletes and coaches.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Purdue University trustees have approved a policy banning faculty, staff and non-athlete students from gambling on sporting events involving any Purdue teams, coaches or student-athletes.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
