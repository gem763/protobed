Five designs were floated, online voting concluded on Labor Day, and we now await the announcement of the winner. (The Times has suggested the deck was stacked by the governor.) No matter which of the five plates the citizenry chooses, though, it\u2019s going to be a stinker: All the designs are terrible. Last night, New York\u2019s city editor Christopher Bonanos and design director Tom Alberty got into a Slack conversation about precisely why they\u2019re so bad.\n\nTom Alberty: I\u2019m late to this, but I just saw there was a statewide vote.\n\nChristopher Bonanos: Yes. There are four finalists showing the Statue of Liberty and one showing the Mario M. Cuomo Bridge, and mayyyybe \u2014 per Nate Silver \u2014 the four Liberty plates will split the vote.\n\nTom: I mean, yes, there\u2019s the political part of it, but what I care about is: All of these designs are terrible.\n\nEven if the Statue of Liberty plates don\u2019t divide the vote and give it to the bridge \u2014 very clever, Governor Cuomo! \u2014 really none stands out. It\u2019s a question of which one is the least bad.\n\nLook, I\u2019m sympathetic to the designer(s) out there doing their jobs, and that the approval and selection process must be complicated. But setting that aside, other states have nice license plates, even really desirable and cool ones. California offers retro black plates. Rhode Island\u2019s is great. Vermont\u2019s is classic.\n\nChris: Delaware\u2019s too. In California, I know, they almost fetishize the old black plates with orange letters \u2014 the originals, I mean, which you can keep using indefinitely. The orange-and-blue New York plate is a classic, and it was really nice to see the state return to that color combination a few years ago.\n\nTom: I say we shouldn\u2019t change it. The current plate \u2014 Empire Gold, the DMV site calls it \u2014 is bold, simple, and classic and recalls the New York license plates of the past. I\u2019d be fine with a new design if it were better, but \u2026\n\nChris: Let\u2019s go over these possibilities one by one because each is its own design failure.\n\nFirst off, which of these do you think is the least bad?\n\nTom: \u2026\n\nChris: Okay, noted. How about we discuss the worst?\n\nTom: Well, let\u2019s pick off the easiest: the one people suspect was engineered to be the winner \u2014 the bridge.\n\nChris: The Mario M. Cuomo Bridge, that is.\n\nTom: BORING.\n\nChris: It\u2019s very gray. And the uprights of the bridge compete with the tall, narrow letters.\n\nTom: For legibility, bad. To get design-pedantic here, plates are supposed to be readable and clearly show the state they\u2019re from. Many vanity plates get awfully busy, and they\u2019re just ugly. Here, it\u2019s a little busy, and it\u2019s boring.\n\nChris: I assume these have all been tested to work with E-ZPass cameras and the like already, but still \u2014 as you say, the main point of a license plate is legibility. I\u2019d also say the secondary point of a plate with an image is to advertise the state by using its public symbols, and \u2014\n\nTom: Of all the state landmarks, a bridge? This bridge? At this scale, it looks like the new Kosciuszko Bridge or the new Goethals Bridge.\n\nChris: Right. This is an attempt to turn the Mario M. Cuomo Bridge into a symbol, rather than evoke the ones we already have, like the Brooklyn Bridge. Which, frankly, is not going to work.\n\nTom: Going back to your question \u2026 I guess the least bad one for me is at the top left [see image at top of page]. It\u2019s clean, and the state symbols are at a minimum scale. But it\u2019s very similar to the old blue-and-white plate, and it looks a little too much like Pennsylvania\u2019s, so \u2026 what\u2019s the point?\n\nChris: It\u2019s also pretty clearly a politicized choice: It has Niagara Falls at the left and the Manhattan skyline and Statue of Liberty at right, so it can resolve the perpetual resentment of upstate voters toward downstate voters. Good for vote getting, bad for design \u2014 because at a distance, the bottom of the plate looks like a PowerPoint bar graph to me, one where fourth-quarter sales are up.\n\nAlso, you\u2019d know more about this than I, but who on earth thought the gold EXCELSIOR in a chunky serif font with black outlines was a good idea? It looks like My First Day With PageMaker circa 1995.\n\nTom: I think that honor goes to No. 4.\n\nChris: Four typefaces on one plate is, uh, impressive \u2014 one being Zapf Chancery, or something trying to be Zapf Chancery. Also the statue\u2019s arm fading into the EXCELSIOR, bringing the word to the edge of unreadability, is not great.\n\nTom: And E PLURIBUS UNUM in wedding-invitation script.\n\nChris: Just floating up there, like a little cloud next to the bolt hole.\n\nTom: Like a whisper.\n\nChris: An awkward, ill-timed whisper. The creepy uncle of mottoes.\n\nTom: So now it\u2019s down to a contest between Ghost Liberty and Opaque Liberty.\n\nChris: The O.L. reminds me of the 1980s plates with the red stripe. I never really liked those, either, but they\u2019re pretty pulled-together compared with this.\n\nTom: True.\n\nChris: Whereas G.L. looks a little irritated at us. Something about the dark eye sockets.\n\nTom: She\u2019s irritated because Trump. Ooof.\n\nChris: She\u2019s an older New York woman, and she has had enough of his nonsense. \u201cGive me your tired, your poor \u2014 and, please, can we get rid of that schmuck already?\u201d\n\nTom: To get art-director nerdy again, the renderings of the Statue of Liberty are like bad clip art. The statue could be worked into a design on the plate in a more graphic or clever way.\n\nChris: Yeah, run the points of the crown across the top or something. I\u2019d say the EXCELSIOR type treatment is best on the Ghost Liberty one. Agree?\n\nTom: Yes.\n\nChris: I\u2019m not sure, but the typeface might be Gotham.\n\nTom: Maybe? It could also be a knockoff. I mean, they\u2019re using a system typeface like Zapf Chancery. C\u2019mon.\n\nChris: Fake Zapf, so fake Gotham would be in keeping with the jankiness of the whole thing.\n\nSo I guess I\u2019d vote for one of the two Libertys \u2014 not sure which. Probably the Ghost Liberty one. Unenthusiastically.\n\nNow, I have a question for you because you\u2019re the graphic-design pro: What would you do, given the assignment? You get one central image, a very brief motto, maybe a shape for the hyphen. My own image ideas are all provincial to New York City and would not get a single vote upstate \u2014 I mean, if I got to choose, I\u2019d put an Anthora coffee cup on it. Or a bagel.\n\nTom: A pigeon! But I think all the plates with imagery look clich\u00e9d, like they\u2019re from a state tourism department.\n\nChris: Which, loosely speaking, they are.\n\nTom: True. Again, the value of \u201cEmpire Gold\u201d: only colors, no symbol, just the small state shape. And it\u2019s simple.\n\nChris: Ah, right \u2014 state colors are not regionally freighted.\n\nTom: If the state wanted to make money, they could make the bridge the default plate, and if you don\u2019t like it, pay extra for a \u201cthrowback\u201d plate \u2014 Empire Gold or the 1980s Liberty plate.\n\nChris: That\u2019s the best idea of all. Options! And at least two that are not awful.\n\nTom: Or they could put out a call and engage some graphic-design talent in the state to give it a shot.\n\nChris: Hey, Milton Glaser hit the bull\u2019s-eye for New York State once before; why not try again?\n\nTom: Yes, Milton, of course. And there\u2019s Michael Bierut at Pentagram \u2014 he\u2019s done civic design for the city (Citi Bike map kiosks, redesigning the city \u201cNo Parking\u201d signs).\n\nChris: I talked to him about Times Square a while back, and his eye for the urban landscape is amazing. His first draft, done while he was sleeping, would be better than any of these designs.\n\nTom: Whatever the outcome of the vote, I\u2019m ready to be disappointed.", "description": "The state has a history of great \u2014 even iconic \u2014 designs for plates.
