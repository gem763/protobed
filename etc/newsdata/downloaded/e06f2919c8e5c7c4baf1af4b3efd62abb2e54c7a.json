No company is above the law and we will continue to take on anyone who takes advantage of the opioid crisis to increase their bottom line.\u201d\n\nSome $500 million of that $700 million will go to the federal government, while the remaining $200 million will be distributed amongst states that had participated in July\u2019s agreement.\n\nIn April, Indivior was indicted after being accused of deceptive marketing practices, misleading doctors and healthcare benefit programs into believing Suboxone, a synthetic opioid used to wean addicts off of heroin and other opioid painkillers was safe from abuse and would be less addictive than the opiate drugs themselves.\n\nUnder the agreement, New York's Medicaid program will receive more than $71.9 million, with $39.9 million to be returned to New York State, James revealed. The remaining five states that are a part of the $700 million settlement are California, Indiana, Ohio, Virginia, and Washington.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "New York alongside five other states have reached a $700 million settlement against Suboxone drug maker Reckitt Benckiser.", "authors": ["Matthew Mcnulty"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Reckitt-Benckiser.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
