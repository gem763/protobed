Prosecutors had declined to bring charges, citing insufficient evidence, but a civilian judiciary panel twice voted to indict the executives, overruling the determination not to go to trial.\n\n\u201cIf I were a gambling man I would certainly not bet on a conviction. The citizen-panel initiated trials do not have a good success rate,\u201d Colin Jones, a professor at the Doshisha Law School in Kyoto, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThe charitable view would be that prosecutors don\u2019t take cases unless they know they can win, so it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that the cases they don\u2019t want to take end up being losers,\u201d he said.\n\nCitizen judiciary panels, selected by lottery, are a rarely used feature of Japan\u2019s legal system introduced after World War Two to curb bureaucratic overreach.\n\nIndictments brought by the panels, however, have a low conviction rate. One review of eight of these cases by the Eiko Sogo Law Office found just one, equal to a 17 percent conviction rate, compared with an overall rate of 98 percent in Japan.\n\nJapan\u2019s government estimated in 2016 that the total cost of dismantling Tepco\u2019s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, decontaminating the affected areas, and paying compensation would amount to around $200 billion (\u00a3161.26 billion).\n\nMore than 160,000 residents fled nearby towns in the aftermath of the March 2011 tsunami as radiation from the reactor meltdowns contaminated water, food and air.", "description": "A Tokyo court will hand down a verdict later this week on whether three Tokyo Electric Power executives are liable for the 2011 Fukushima disaster, the only criminal case to arise out of the world's worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl in 1986.", "authors": ["Aaron Sheldrick", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430809305&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0SB", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
