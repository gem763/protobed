Of course, the animals would be oblivious to these actions. \u201cAnimal standing,\u201d as the issue is known, is really a Trojan Horse (pun intended) to allow animal rights extremists to seek court rulings enforcing their own ideology.\n\nThe Nonhuman Rights Project is leading this charge. Having failed to win personhood for chimpanzees \u2014 alarmingly, the idea gained support from one high court judge \u2014 it is now pursing a case in New York to determine whether \u201cHappy,\u201d an elephant at the Bronx Zoo, should be granted a writ of habeas corpus. (Ponder the surreality of those words!) From The Guardian story:\n\nLawyers representing an elephant have argued in a New York City court that their trunked client be considered a person, in a fresh attempt to upend human dominance over this designation. Happy the elephant is, contrary to her sunny name, being detained by the Bronx Zoo \u201cillegally\u201d, due to her personhood, and must be released, according to the pachyderm\u2019s self-appointed legal team. The case\u2019s instigator, an animal rights group, hopes it will cause a legal breakthrough that will elevate the status of elephants, which the group calls \u201cextraordinarily complex creatures\u201d similar to humans that should have the fundamental right to liberty.\n\nNo. Animals are amoral. They can never have \u201crights,\u201d just as they can never be held morally accountable to fulfill duties.\n\nThe suit charges that Happy is not being cared for properly:\n\nThe 47-year-old elephant has spent almost all her life in a one-acre enclosure at the Bronx Zoo after being captured along with six other calves \u2014 named Sleepy, Grumpy, Sneezy, Doc, Dopey and Bashful \u2014 in Thailand and brought to the US. Happy and Grumpy cohabited until 2002, when they were relocated to an enclosure with two other elephants \u2014 Maxine and Patty. This arrangement turned sour when Maxine and Patty fatally attacked Grumpy. Happy has never been able to live contentedly with the duo, with a recent reconciliation attempt ending badly. Happy\u2019s lone captivity is anathema to the intricate social arrangements elephants have in the wild, according to experts cited by the Nonhuman Rights Project, which wants her relocated to a far larger sanctuary in California that has other elephants.\n\nWait a minute! Moving Happy from one place of captivity to another is not \u201cliberty.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say that Happy shouldn\u2019t be moved to a different location where she can be with other elephants. Pacaderms are highly social.\n\nIf keeping an elephant alone is abuse \u2014 and I suspect it is \u2014 the court should require that the unacceptable status quo be remedied. But the case should be decided based on a proper animal welfare analysis, not the fallacious \u201crights\u201d invention that seeks to diminish human beings into just another animal in the forest.\n\nThe distinction between animal rights and animal welfare is crucial. Animal rights is an ideology that humans and animals are equal. Thus PETA once argued that owning a leather couch is the moral equivalent of purchasing a lamp made from human skin from Auschwitz. Animal-rights believers believe that there should be no human ownership of animals for any reason.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn contrast, animal welfare sees the proper care of animals as a human duty in keeping with our exceptionalism. This approach accepts the propriety of making instrumental use of animals, but requires us to do so for proper reasons and in a humane manner, based on the particular characteristics of the animals in question.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA lot of people think they believe in animal rights when they actually support a vigorous approach to animal welfare.
