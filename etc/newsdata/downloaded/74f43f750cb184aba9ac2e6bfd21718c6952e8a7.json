Some may be alumni, but some people\u2019s identities were unknown.\u201d\n\nWith a new law banning face coverings at public assemblies coming into effect last Saturday, the Education Bureau has asked schools to remind students not to wear masks on or outside campuses. They were also asked to report the number of those wearing masks to school.\n\nYeung defended the move, saying schools were asked to give a \u201crough impression\u201d of the number of those wearing masks on Tuesday to get a picture of pupils\u2019 emotions so as to provide suitable supportive services.\n\nThe data collection process was continuing as of Friday, Yeung said. If a lot of pupils were seen wearing masks on campus, the bureau would contact the school to find out if \u201cmany students were sick or whether there were other reasons\u201d.\n\n\n\nYeung also said any student convicted of an offence had \u201cpaid the price\u201d by receiving a penalty and that society should accept these youngsters and help them rehabilitate.\n\nNearly one-third of protesters arrested since the social unrest broke out in June were aged under 18, government officials revealed on Thursday.\n\nYeung said that by law children under the age of 15 had the right to receive an education and if they were unable to attend school for some time the government would find the students a suitable place to continue their studies.\n\nSecondary students wore black on Dress Casual Day as demonstration against government and police\n\n\u201cI hope everyone can understand that from an educational aspect, we wish to lead every youngster and student on the right path. As long as students are willing to learn, we are willing, and our education system should give him or her a chance to learn,\u201d he said.\n\nTwo teachers were suspended last month over controversial online comments related to the protests, as the bureau had received multiple complaints over teachers\u2019 conduct since June.\n\nYeung said he did not rule out that some educators were not \u201cperforming well enough\u201d but that teachers and principals were under immense pressure in the face of a divided society.\n\n\u201cMost educators remain very professional and have tried to do their best,\u201d Yeung said, adding that the bureau would try to understand the situation at schools where complaints were received and urged society to \u201chave more trust\u201d in teachers and schools.", "description": "Education Bureau chief Kevin Yeung also reiterated that anti-mask law officially came into effect last Saturday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/28b96b6e-ebfe-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4imagehires182748.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
