But bosses now insist the worst is over\n\nBut yesterday the stock rebounded as bosses said the worst was over, with shares leaping 28.4 per cent, or 726p, to 3286p.\n\nThat was despite the scale of the damage, a brutal 68 per cent fall in profits, being laid bare for the first time.\n\nAlthough sales rose from \u00a32.4billion to \u00a32.7billion in the year to August 31, Asos said profits fell from \u00a3102million to \u00a333.1million.\n\nThis was after spending \u00a3221.6million on infrastructure, leading to an increase in its debts.\n\nNick Beighton, the chief executive of Asos, said: 'This financial year was a pivotal period for Asos, where we have invested significantly.\n\nStock Watch - Sativa Group Sativa Group has been granted a licence by the Government to grow cannabis in Somerset. The firm, which produces the plant for medicinal purposes, said the licence allowed it to grow cannabis that contains more than 0.2 per cent tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a psychoactive compound. It can now collaborate with researchers looking at the impact of the drug on people with respiratory health issues. Sativa already grows cannabis with lower levels of THC. The shares closed at 4.75p.\n\n'Regrettably this was more disruptive than we originally anticipated. We are now in a more positive position to start the new financial year.'\n\nPrivate healthcare firm Mediclinic International was also on the rise after issuing a cheery trading update.\n\nThe company said that profits would be better than expected when it reports half-year results next month, after strong performance in southern Africa and the Middle East.\n\nRevenue for the six months to September 30 was about 9 per cent higher than a year ago, while profits were likely to have risen by 5 per cent to about \u00a3224million. Its shares surged 3.5 per cent, or 12.5p, to 370.5p.\n\nMiner Rio Tinto was another firm to update investors, reporting a 5 per cent rise in iron ore shipments that was helped by strong demand from China.\n\nThe London-based company shipped 86.1m tonnes of the ore in the three months to the end of September, compared with 81.9m a year earlier.\n\nIron ore typically accounts for more than 60 per cent of Rio's earnings. It said it still expected iron ore shipments for the year of between 320m and 330m tonnes, however, after a global squeeze on supplies started to ease. Shares fell 0.9 per cent, or 0.8p, to 89.8p.\n\nMeanwhile, political drama affected UK stocks and the pound as Boris Johnson's frantic attempts to strike an eleventh-hour Brexit deal continued.\n\nThe FTSE 100 fell 0.6 per cent, or 43.69 points, to 7167.95, while the domestically-focused FTSE 250 dipped 0.05 per cent, or 9.01 points, to 20,187.96, suggesting traders remain unsure about the outcome.\n\nOne of the big blue-chip fallers was Auto Trader Group, which sells used cars online.\n\nIts stock dropped 2.7 per cent, or 15p, to 535.4p after UK inflation data showed the prices of second-hand cars fell by 1.4 per cent between August and September compared with a rise of 1.4 per cent a year ago.\n\nGoing in the opposite direction were shares in food delivery firm Just Eat, which edged up 0.4 per cent, or 2.2p, to 632p after rival Deliveroo was hit by a competition inquiry.\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority announced it was pressing ahead with a merger probe over a multi-million pound investment Amazon wants to make in Deliveroo, concerned that competition would be hampered if Amazon were to gobble up its smaller partner at some point in the future.\n\nOther top movers included troubled car maker Aston Martin, which saw shares surge 7.5 per cent, or 33.7p, to 480.9p, and BBA Aviation, where shares tumbled 5.2 per cent, or 16.4p, to 302.2p.", "description": "Internet fashion retailer Asos suffered\u00a0months of warehousing problems that have limited how many products it can sell, hampering sales growth.
