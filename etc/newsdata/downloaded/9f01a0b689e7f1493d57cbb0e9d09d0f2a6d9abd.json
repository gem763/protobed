The reports somewhat offset last week\u2019s upbeat data on consumer spending that had suggested that while the economy was slowing, it was not losing momentum as rapidly as financial markets were flagging.\n\nThe economy\u2019s waning fortunes have been blamed on the White House\u2019s year-long trade war with China. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday trade talks with China were going well, but he warned that he would be \u201ctougher\u201d in negotiations if the discussions dragged on past the 2020 U.S. election and he won a second term.\n\n\u201cThe canary in the mine may be falling off its perch,\u201d said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. \u201cWith manufacturing now starting to contract, it is even more critical that the consumer keeps spending.\u201d\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity dropped to a reading of 49.1 last month from 51.2 in July. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for about 12% of the U.S. economy. Last month marked the first time since August 2016 that the index broke below the 50 threshold.\n\nAugust\u2019s reading was also the lowest since January 2016 and was the fifth straight monthly decline in the index. The United States now joins the euro zone, Japan, the United Kingdom and China, which have long been experiencing a contraction in factory activity.\n\nStill, the ISM index remains above the 43 level, which economists associate with a recession. The U.S.-China trade tensions also coincide with diminishing stimulus from last year\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax cut package.\n\nThe ISM said there had been \u201ca notable decrease in business confidence,\u201d adding that \u201ctrade remains the most significant issue, indicated by the strong contraction in new export orders.\u201d Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the ISM index would slip to 51.0 in August.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade fight is eroding business sentiment, with business investment contracting in the second quarter for the first time in more than three years. That, together with an inventory bloat, is undercutting manufacturing, with output declining for two straight quarters.\n\nConsumers have largely shrugged off the trade dispute and continued to spend, propping up the economy. But that could change with the trade war spilling over to shopping malls.\n\nA new round of U.S. tariffs on imports of Chinese goods, mostly consumer products like clothing, footwear and televisions, took effect on Sept. 1. Additional U.S. tariffs are due to be imposed in December.\n\nWith trade tensions simmering in the background, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates again this month to keep the economic expansion, now in its 11th year, on track.\n\nThe Fed lowered its short-term interest rate by 25 basis points in July for the first time since 2008, citing trade tensions and slowing global growth. Financial markets have fully priced in another quarter-percentage-point cut at the Fed\u2019s Sept. 17-18 policy meeting.\n\nU.S. Treasury prices rose on the factory data, with the yield in the benchmark 10-year note dropping to its lowest since July 2016. The Treasury yield curve has inverted, signaling that a recession is looming. Stocks on Wall Street fell, while the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies.\n\nORDERS TUMBLE\n\nThe ISM\u2019s forward-looking new orders sub-index dropped to a reading of 47.2 last month, the lowest level since June 2012, from 50.8 in July. A measure of export orders plunged 4.8 points to the lowest level since April 2009.\n\nThe survey\u2019s factory employment tumbled to 47.4, the weakest reading since March 2016, from 51.7 in July. This raises the risk that factory payrolls contracted in August. Manufacturers cut hours in July, pushing the factory workweek to its lowest level since November 2011. Factories also cut overtime in July.\n\nThe government will publish August\u2019s employment report on Friday.\n\n\u201cThis (ISM) report is a warning that the tariff and trade uncertainty is continuing to weigh on manufacturing activity, and that this uncertainty is a growing risk to the expansion,\u201d said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.\n\nThe ISM said nine industries, including furniture and related products, machinery and chemical products reported growth last month. Transportation equipment, primary metals and electrical equipment, appliances and components were among the seven industries reporting a contraction.\n\nMachinery manufacturers said \u201cbusiness is starting to show signs of a broad slowdown.\u201d Electrical equipment, appliances and components makers complained that \u201ctariffs continue to be a strain on the supply chain and the economy overall.\u201d\n\nThat sentiment resonated across all industries. Manufacturers of furniture and related products said \u201cincoming sales seem to be slowing down, and this is usually our busiest season.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: Robots work on the assembly line of 2019 Ram pickup trucks at the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Sterling Heights Assembly Plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan, U.S., October 22, 2018.

Data for June was revised up to show construction outlays decreasing 0.7 instead of falling 1.3% as previously reported.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending would rise 0.3% in July. Construction spending fell 2.7% on a year-on-year basis in July.", "description": "U.S. manufacturing activity contracted for the first time in three years in August, with new orders and hiring declining sharply as trade tensions weighed on business confidence, raising financial market fears of a recession.", "authors": ["Lucia Mutikani", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425799906&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF821DH"}
