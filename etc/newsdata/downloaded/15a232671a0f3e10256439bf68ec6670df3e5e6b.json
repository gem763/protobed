He said the concentrated nature of the banking industry and collaboration between key players helped Australia navigate the global financial crisis.\n\nSenior banking sector leaders say it's import Australia's banks remain strong to ensure they can support the economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI believe a strong banking system is essential for our nation\u2019s economic wellbeing,\" said former Reserve Bank board member Kathryn Fagg, after she was appointed as a non-executive director of National Australia Bank on Tuesday.\n\nAnalysts aren't expecting the new inquiry will materially impact on bank earnings, suggesting it's unlikely the ACCC would introduce some form of price regulation to reduce the gap between interest rates paid by new and existing customers - the so-called \"loyalty tax\" that earns the major banks almost $4 billion in revenue each year.\n\n\u201cThe government and ACCC are clearly very focussed on the gap between the front book and the back book. Any forced closing of this gap could have negative consequences for all banks, albeit we still view this as unlikely as it would represent a big step towards price control,\" said JP Morgan analyst Andrew Triggs.\n\nDon't look backwards\n\nMr Byres said banks will be capable of dealing with yet another inquiry but cautioned against overloading excessive scrutiny on the sector when it is having to navigate big changes including from new competitors.\n\n\u201cThere is no way [the new inquiry] could be described as the straw that broke the camels back or anything like that, but there is a lot of change rolling through the industry, and we have to make sure we are not always looking backwards, but looking forwards at how business models are going to change and technology is going to change the financial system,\" he said. \"We have to make sure we don\u2019t lose sight of those things.\u201d\n\nAfter APRA deputy chairman Helen Rowell on Monday said APRA will shortly publish \"heat maps\" of MySuper products' investments and fees, Mr Byres described the initiative as a \u201cstep change in transparency\u201d that would \"put more pressure on the underperformers to lift their game\", while reflecting \"a commitment by us to\u2026be seen to be doing something [about underperforming funds]\u201d.\n\nAfter the damning capability review of APRA by Graeme Samuel, Mr Byres said it has made it a strategic priority \"to communicate more and more frequently to improve the understanding of what we do and why we do it.\"\n\n\u201cNot that long ago we were flagged as the regulator of choice when we were given the BEAR regime. Now we are not the regulator of choice. Everyone will have their day in the sun and their day in the shade. We will just get on with what we think is the right thing.\u201d", "description": "APRA chairman Wayne Byres agrees with bank chiefs that Rod Sims' inquiry will force facts about mortgage pricing to be put on the table.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7359%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_361%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a21e5778327118cce442ed1fc08be475db7b9e37", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
