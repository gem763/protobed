HBO and Warner Bros. have just approached the erstwhile Leftovers and Lost showrunner for the third time about an extremely sensitive topic for geeks: Watchmen. The graphic novel of that name was originally published in serial form by DC Comics in 1986 and 1987 and has subsequently been hailed as one of the greatest superhero stories ever published. It depicts costumed adventurers as narcissistic, violent perverts who leave destruction in their wake, and fans have long admired it as a deconstructionist take on a hoary genre. However, it\u2019s also been a source of great controversy on two fronts. For one, progressive critics have cast aspersions on its portrayal of women, queer people, and people of color.\n\nBut more pressing to Lindelof was the second matter, which has to do with creators\u2019 rights. Watchmen was written by Alan Moore and drawn by Dave Gibbons, and the initial plan was for the rights to the book to revert to them after a period of initial publication. However, there was a stipulation that the Warner-owned DC would hold onto the rights if the book didn\u2019t go out of print \u2014 which it never did, and rather than follow up on Moore\u2019s intended outcome, DC used that quasi-loophole to hold onto the rights. A displeased Moore eventually severed ties with DC over that and other disputes, and has declared his disapproval of all subsequent uses of Watchmen properties, such as a 2009 film adaptation and a 2011 series of prequel comics. (Gibbons has been more cooperative, and you can read more about the counterarguments to Moore\u2019s stance here.)\n\nLindelof is a longtime Watchmen superfan and Moore admirer, so when HBO and Warner asked him to do something with the book on television, he initially refused. They asked again; again, he turned them down. But on that third time \u2026 well, he started wondering whether he might be able to do something interesting with it. It was soon after that I received an odd email asking if I\u2019d be willing to speak with Lindelof about a mysterious matter. We scheduled a phone call, during which he explained that he had read a Vulture essay I\u2019d published just a few days prior. DC had started to incorporate Watchmen\u2019s characters into their mainstream superhero universe, meaning they could meet up with Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and the rest of the gang. I thought this was a bad idea.\n\nLindelof was receptive to that argument and, after swearing me to secrecy, told me about the HBO/Warner offer and asked if I thought it would be smart to move forward, considering their history with Moore. I told him it was probably unethical, but that if he went through with it, there were ways he could make it interesting. Eight months later, it was announced that Lindelof was making a Watchmen series. Later, he published an open letter (which I offered some prepublication notes on, per his request) saying the show would not be a straight adaptation, but rather a \u201cremix.\u201d Over the next year, we emailed occasionally about how the series was developing. I was far from a consultant on the show \u2014 indeed, I knew no details until I saw media screeners a few weeks ago \u2014 but I told him he owed me a big interview before it came out. \u201cA Lindelof always pays his debts,\u201d was his response.\n\nFast-forward to last week, when I sat in Lindelof\u2019s memorabilia-lined office in Santa Monica for 90 minutes and we talked about Watchmen, both the book and the show. It was an intriguing conversation, revealing Lindelof as a man both proud of what he and his collaborators have made, but also deeply unhappy with his decision to make it in the first place. He\u2019s also pretty sure that Moore, an avowed practitioner of magic, put a curse on him. No, seriously.\n\nHow are you feeling?\n\nHow I\u2019m feeling, in general, is excitement. It\u2019s very hard not to feel excited when I\u2019m driving around and I see Watchmen billboards with Regina [King]. There\u2019s relief that it\u2019s finally going to be out there. But there\u2019s a lot of fear and trepidation about how it\u2019s going to be processed. Not just the usual \u201cWill people like it?\u201d Obviously, I\u2019ve come to some degree of peace that not everybody is going to like it. It\u2019s not going to be universally loved, especially because it\u2019s Watchmen and especially because it\u2019s about what it\u2019s about. It\u2019s more a fear of being misunderstood or wondering whether it should have been this. I\u2019m alternately proud of it and second-guessing myself.\n\nThe rights to Watchmen, the book, were supposed to revert to Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. But DC Comics didn\u2019t do that and Moore has historically been furious about it, as have readers who advocate for creator rights.* What does it feel like to make a show that a lot of people are going to oppose on principle, independent of the quality of the material? Is that something you think about?\n\nThat\u2019s something that I think about a lot. What are the ethical ramifications of this even existing at all when I completely and totally side with the creator? Acknowledge that the creator has been exploited by a corporation? Now that very same corporation is basically compensating me to continue this thing.\n\nI ask, \u201cIs it even hypocrisy?\u201d Then I say, as a fan, \u201cWhere would I come down on this thing if someone else was doing it? If I heard someone else was doing an HBO series called Watchmen that was not a strict adaptation of the book?\u201d I felt that I\u2019d be really angry about it and then I\u2019d watch it. [Laughs.] I wonder how many of the angry people who don\u2019t think it should exist will actually have the discipline to not even watch it. Those are the people that I really admire. The ones who are like, \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t exist and I\u2019m literally not watching it.\u201d That\u2019s an admirable position.\n\nDoes it keep you up at night? Or have you made your peace with it?\n\nIt wakes me up at night, but much less so now that it\u2019s done. I\u2019m about to say something very ridiculous, but in all sincerity, I was absolutely convinced that there was a magical curse placed upon me by Alan [Moore]. I\u2019m actually feeling the psychological effects of a curse, and I\u2019m okay with it. It\u2019s fair that he has placed a curse on me. The basis for this, my twisted logic, was that I heard that he had placed a curse on Zack [Snyder]\u2019s [Watchmen] movie. There is some fundamental degree of hubris and narcissism in saying he even took the time to curse me. But I became increasingly convinced that it had, in fact, happened. So I was like, \u201cWell, at least I\u2019m completely and totally miserable the entire time.\u201d I should be!\n\nWhen Zack was making Watchmen \u2014 and I only know this because I watched the DVDs \u2014 I was like, \u201cThis guy is having the time of his life!\u201d And I did not enjoy any of this. That\u2019s the price that I paid. Psychological professionals would probably suggest that I emotionally created the curse as a way of creating balance for the immorality.\n\nWhen we first spoke, you were pretty sure that HBO and Warner Bros. were gonna get someone to do a Watchmen show. You were like, \u201cIf it\u2019s me, I can make it as good as it can be so it doesn\u2019t suck.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s hypocrisy, too. It\u2019s like, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t kill the animal. The steak\u2019s already there. So me not eating the steak doesn\u2019t save it.\u201d It\u2019s a bogus argument to say, \u201cSomeone else would have done Watchmen, so it might as well have been me because I loved it the most.\u201d I have to accept the bogusness of that argument and say the truth, which is I just wanted to do it so bad. I wanted to return to the source. This thing that I read when I was 13 years old is what made me. I tried to say \u201cNo\u201d twice, but it kept coming back. Twenty years from now, am I going to be regretting that I didn\u2019t do Watchmen because I was scared? If I\u2019m a professional storyteller and I love and revere Watchmen and I spent countless hours of my life thinking about this thing? I wanted to do it.\n\nYou keep talking about being miserable; how miserable are we talking here? Was there nothing joyful about putting together the show?\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say that there was nothing joyful about it. Certainly, the first ten to 12 weeks that we spent in the writers\u2019 room, where we started talking about the vision for the season, that was immensely challenging and not fun. It was work. And, obviously, we\u2019re talking about white supremacy. When you spend hours and hours talking about that stuff, it is supposed to be unpleasant.\n\nThere were some days that I came home and I was like, \u201cWe had a really good day today.\u201d I was never suicidal. I was never fearful of my life. I don\u2019t like using the word depressed because I know people who are really depressed. That feeling of not wanting to get out of bed and despair and hopelessness \u2014 I had all those feelings, but they were attached very specifically to the show. What I was saying to my collaborators on a fairly constant basis was, \u201cThis was a huge mistake. I never should have done this. Why did I do this? I can\u2019t quit, I have to see it through, but this was a huge mistake.\u201d\n\nDoesn\u2019t that demoralize people?\n\nYes.\n\nHow did this show get to the finish line, then? How did you manage to power through?\n\nA lot of work that we did in those 12 weeks ended up being the show. Also, the first thing that we did was we wrote all of Jeremy [Irons]\u2019s material. We went to Wales, and we shot everything, all the way through the finale, for him. He\u2019s not in episode six, but every other episode, you get this Black Freighter\u2013esque interlude. We had to plot all that stuff out and shoot it right after. They picked up the pilot, and then, based on the weather, we were like, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go to Wales. This thing has to be finished shooting by the end of October or things are going to get very inclement, literally and figuratively.\u201d\n\nJeremy Irons in Watchmen. Photo: HBO\n\nSo the Veidt stuff was super-duper fun because we did it first. It gave us a road map. It\u2019s like we had run mile one, mile seven, mile 15, mile 18, mile 21, and mile 26 of the marathon, so it was just kind of connecting the dots. The other part was the material that we were getting back from [shooting in] Atlanta. The stuff that we were getting for [episodes] two and three was like, \u201cJean Smart is really good. Regina is really amazing. This stuff is working.\u201d As miserable as I was, I\u2019d watch dailies and I\u2019d be like, \u201cThat\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d\n\nThe short answer, now that I\u2019ve monologued about it, is the show stopped feeling like it was mine and it started feeling like it was ours.\n\nGiven the racial and gender politics of the show, I didn\u2019t want this to just be a conversation between two white men. So I reached out to a group of women of various ethnic backgrounds who wrote a series of essays called \u201cWomen Watch the Watchmen\u201d to ask them what they\u2019d want to ask you. The first question comes from Chloe Maveal: \u201cDo you feel like this show is something that can help redeem Watchmen to literally anyone who\u2019s not part of a straight white male audience? Do you, as both a fan of the comics and showrunner of the TV series, feel like the comic books here need redeeming in the first place?\u201d\n\n[Long pause.] I\u2019m only thinking because words are very important. The word redemption is not semantics.\n\nTake your time.\n\nI don\u2019t think that the original Watchmen requires redemption on any level. In any way, shape, or form. I accept it in its totality as a staggering work of art. I also acknowledge that my relationship with Watchmen is that of a hetero straight male who read it as a 13-year-old, which may be the perfect sweet spot. I am not in a place where I can be critical of Watchmen. I am in a place where I can acknowledge criticisms of Watchmen. I will say that a number of the women who worked on Watchmen \u2014 wrote Watchmen, produced Watchmen, directed Watchmen \u2014 had found the treatment of women in the graphic novel to be less than ideal.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about Laurie. In our presentation of Laurie 30 years later, instead of apologizing for or mocking her younger self, we can show she\u2019s evolved. I think that we were given clues at the end of the original Watchmen \u2014 when she says that she wants to get some guns \u2014 that she\u2019s feeling this kinship with her dad. So I\u2019m like, \u201cInstead of casting somebody to play Eddie Blake in flashbacks, what if Laurie is now Eddie Blake?\u201d Not to write her in a masculine way, but to give her that level of nihilism and cynicism. It\u2019s not an idea about redeeming the original Laurie.\n\nJean Smart in Watchmen. Photo: HBO\n\nWe would have Watchmen book club in the writers\u2019 room. Every two or three days, we would unpack an issue. We would argue and debate on areas of ambiguity. I think it\u2019s just fascinating that these characters are so dimensionalized \u2014 most of them. You really care about them, but they don\u2019t fit into a very, very simple box. Laurie, I would say, lacked the same level of dimensionality that some of the other male characters in Watchmen do. I would actually argue that Silk Spectre, her mom, is fairly dimensionalized. That\u2019s a very provocative idea in 2019, let alone in 1986, that a woman is in love with her rapist. I think, through a certain prism, that idea would require some redemption.\n\nBecause I\u2019m not Alan Moore, I get to make a Watchmen that\u2019s like, \u201cHere\u2019s how I feel about female characters. Here\u2019s how I feel about characters of color. Here\u2019s how I feel about Rorschach.\u201d I get to have those debates in the writers\u2019 room. Those other writers get to say, \u201cWell, here\u2019s how I feel about it.\u201d Of course, in the writers\u2019 room, there was a wide range of whether or not Rorschach was a white supremacist. I said, \u201cThat\u2019s not relevant. He\u2019s dead. What\u2019s interesting is that you can make a compelling argument that he was and I can make a compelling argument that he wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThat gets to a question from Sara Century: \u201cWhy is it important to reimagine Rorschach?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think that we are reimagining Rorschach. I think that we are interpreting Rorschach. The meta-ness of Watchmen was critical, I think, to its success. This idea of a comic book that is deconstructing comic books, to the degree where a comic book, The Black Freighter, is inside the comic book. You\u2019re actually deconstructing the form. For Veidt to be able to say, \u201cI\u2019m not some Republic Serial villain\u201d with a straight face when he is monologuing about how he just dropped a fake alien squid on New York City and killed 3 million people? That is meta at its most brilliant meta-ness. To that degree, the show is about appropriation. We\u2019re appropriating the original Watchmen. We\u2019re reinterpreting it. We\u2019re saying, \u201cInstead of just being a cover band, we\u2019re going to try to make a new album that is inspired by the original Watchmen and bears its name.\u201d\n\nOne of the things that really struck me on my reread of Watchmen, as we were writing the show, was how ineffective Rorschach is. He actually doesn\u2019t accomplish anything. He finds the Comedian costume in Blake\u2019s apartment and then he goes to warn Dr. Manhattan that someone is coming after masks. First off, Dr. Manhattan would know if somebody was coming after him, so Rorschach\u2019s theory is entirely wrong. Then his investigative technique is to just walk into bars and break people\u2019s fingers. He gets suckered by Moloch and gets thrown into jail. Dan shows up and gets him away, then he shows up in Karnak too late to stop Veidt\u2019s plan. Then he insists on exposing it all to the one person who he knows is going to kill him. His journal doesn\u2019t out Veidt because everything that he learns in Karnak was not in his journal. So he\u2019s not the brightest bulb. He\u2019s got some very non-progressive views about the world. He\u2019s sad and he\u2019s tragic. At the same time, I love Rorschach. I loved him as a 13-year-old, and I still love him. When you see the tears streaming down his face when his mask is pulled off, one of the cops is saying, \u201cThis little runt is wearing lifts.\u201d It just breaks my heart every time. I have such empathy and compassion for this guy who\u2019s losing. The world is sickening, and there\u2019s nothing that he can do to stop it. He\u2019s broken, so he\u2019s going to appeal to broken people.\n\nI worry that the first six episodes, in some ways, can almost be read as a white-supremacist militiaman\u2019s vision of America. Like, \u201cCops care too much about black people, and they\u2019re cracking down on proud whites like me who just want to see a pure country.\u201d But in reality, the much bigger problem is cops not caring enough about black people. Was that something you thought about? Was that something that worried you?\n\nYes. I\u2019m not even going to use the past tense. What we\u2019re really worried about, in my opinion, it\u2019s not the television show. What we\u2019re really worried about is a reflection of the real world. The paradox is: How do we feel about the police? When you say \u201cthe police,\u201d you can mean it quite literally, which is just people wearing police uniforms. But how do you feel about authority? How do you feel about the law? Is the law just? The answer to the question, \u201cHow do you feel about the police?\u201d Well, are you white? Are you a man? Are you a woman? Are you a person of color? What part of the country are you living in? Those are all questions that you should be asking.\n\nWe understand that being a police officer is a dangerous job. At the same time, we understand that there are police officers who are not following the law, who cannot be trusted, who do not behave in ways that are demonstrative of equality. This is demonstrated for us over and over again, to the degree where I think anyone who says that there is no issue in the United States in terms of policing and race is a crazy person. That isn\u2019t to say that all cops are racist is any more ridiculous than saying all cops are not racist.\n\nTim Blake Nelson and Regina King in Watchmen. Photo: HBO\n\nWhen we went to TCA, the very first question was asked by Eric Deggans from NPR, a writer who I think is phenomenal. He also happens to be a man of color. He said, \u201cI think the only interpretation that you can possibly take from this pilot is that we\u2019re supposed to believe that the cops protect black people in this world? I don\u2019t buy that for a second.\u201d I was like, \u201cWell, I think we should revisit this question after you\u2019ve seen all nine episodes.\u201d I\u2019m not going to hide behind the fact that this is an alternate world. I\u2019m not telling anybody how to feel about the police. It\u2019s a TV show. At the end of these nine episodes, are you going to feel that the police are racist? No. You\u2019re going to feel like some are, and you\u2019re going to feel like some aren\u2019t. What are the effects of covering your face?\n\nOne of the great superhero questions.\n\nWhy would you wear a mask? Does the mask protect you or does it unleash your most dangerous and violent tendencies? Those are the ideas that I\u2019m more interested in exploring. People keep saying Watchmen is about superheroes. Other than Dr. Manhattan, they\u2019re not. None of them have powers. They\u2019re vigilantes, at best. So it\u2019s like, \u201cWhat if the police start dressing up?\u201d It\u2019s a provocative and interesting question. When you get to the end of the season, it\u2019s not resolved. In 100 years in the United States of America \u2014 if we make it that far \u2014 we\u2019re still going to be worried about the police and whether or not they treat everybody the same. This is not a solvable problem. But at least I could create a piece of television that had us talking about it.\n\nNot to be a provocateur for provocation\u2019s sake, but the thing about Watchmen is you can create a space to have these conversations. The territory that worries me the most is what I\u2019ll call the Joker territory. Was this irresponsible to do? Is it harmful? Not just in the most extreme case, where God forbid, somebody goes and sees Joker and that incites them to engage in a violent act. But if somebody wanted to be Rorschach for Halloween, would they go, \u201cMaybe I can\u2019t do this anymore because Damon Lindelof ruined Rorschach. Now, if I put on this mask, people are going to think that I\u2019m a white supremacist.\u201d I don\u2019t want to ruin Rorschach. But at the same time, when you were dressing up as Rorschach before I made this show, which part of him were you idolizing?\n\nIn the world of the show, a lot of the racial politics emanate from the fact that Robert Redford, a well-intentioned liberal, has been president of the United States for decades. You don\u2019t say he\u2019s created a dystopian nightmare, but you certainly don\u2019t say we all lived happily ever after.\n\nWhat you\u2019re talking about is exactly the intention. Clearly, it was off the table to say that the president of the United States was going to modeled on Trump in any way. Then it\u2019s not Watchmen. Also, we were left a clue at the end of the original, which is that Robert Redford was running for president. We contend that he never, ever would have been able to beat Nixon at the height of Nixon\u2019s popularity, especially post-squid. So Nixon wins in \u201988, he beats Redford, and then he dies in office in \u201990. Redford gets to run again, against Gerald Ford, and he wins. We had all these conversations about, \u201cWho was on the Supreme Court in \u201992 when Redford became president? Who would have been on Nixon\u2019s Supreme Court? How many years would it have taken for Redford to get a Supreme Court that would go liberal?\u201d In the meantime, the world is still spinning as a result of 3 million people dying in New York.\n\nLiberals get two things wildly wrong, in my opinion as an unabashed liberal. One is we spend way too much time wagging our fingers. The second is we don\u2019t know when to stop regulating. Regulation is important, it\u2019s necessary, but that\u2019s what the people on the right legitimately fear. So, when does it stop? What is it to be 30 years into a liberal regime? That felt like low-hanging fruit that is too delicious not to not grab at. It\u2019s going to be imperfect. You need a two-party system in order to achieve some level of balance. It doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not wildly progressive. But if you said to me, \u201cHow do you feel about a Senate that is divided 70-30?\u201d I\u2019d say that\u2019s no bueno. That\u2019s not going to be representative of America.\n\nHow did you sell it to Redford?\n\nI didn\u2019t.\n\nReally?\n\nI was really afraid that he\u2019d say, \u201cPlease don\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nRedford had no say on any of this?\n\nThere was a time that we wanted every episode to have a post-credits sequence, just like the comic book. One of them was Redford giving an excerpt from his State of the Union. That would have required us going to Redford and saying, \u201cWe would like you to actually play the president of the United States.\u201d Then, literally four days after Jeff [Jensen] drafted an outline for it, Redford announced that he was retiring from acting. I\u2019m certainly not going to pick up the phone and say, \u201cHey, I\u2019m the guy who completely totally ignored what Alan Moore wanted me to do. Now, I\u2019d like to also disrespect your wishes because it\u2019s all about me. I couldn\u2019t help but notice that you retired from acting, but would you like to play yourself as president of the United States?\u201d He\u2019s going to say, \u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d So we just did it.\n\nYou haven\u2019t gotten any complaints?\n\nI hope that he\u2019s tickled by it. One of the things that I always loved about Veep, which is one of my favorite shows ever, is that the president is just off-camera. When you see Nixon in Zack\u2019s movie, when it was an actor playing Nixon, it took me out of it in a weird way.\n\nSo yeah, the classy thing to have done would have been what I did with Alan, which is writing him a letter saying, \u201cI\u2019d like your blessing to do this.\u201d Then getting a letter back that says, \u201cLeave me alone.\u201d\n\nYou got a letter back from Alan?\n\nI\u2019m paraphrasing. I didn\u2019t get a letter back from Alan. [Pauses.] I received a communication back from Alan, in which he made it clear \u2014 and I want to respect this \u2014 that he didn\u2019t want his name to be used in any way. It\u2019s not really possible for me not to mention his name, like he\u2019s Voldemort. But if you want to support Alan Moore\u2019s wishes, do not watch the show. That\u2019s what he would want.\n\nIf Dave Gibbons, another co-creator of the book, had said no, would you have done the show?\n\n[Pauses.] Probably not. When we talked to Dave, Jeff and I, we were able to say to him, \u201cWe\u2019re not doing your 12 issues, we\u2019re doing 30 years later. We\u2019re going to have Veidt and Laurie. It wouldn\u2019t be Watchmen if Dr. Manhattan didn\u2019t make some kind of appearance. But it\u2019s just going to be those three. They are in support of a new story. This isn\u2019t their continuing adventures.\u201d Dave is like, \u201cThat sounds really cool.\u201d If he had said, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t feel like Watchmen to me\u201d or \u201cI think you\u2019re getting a bit out over your skis,\u201d that would have given me serious pause.\n\nDo you think people should read the comic before they watch the show?\n\nThe way that I feel about it is that everybody should read Watchmen. Not everybody\u2019s going to like it, but it\u2019s [like] Catcher in the Rye, Huck Finn, Things Fall Apart, Animal Farm, Lord of the Flies \u2014 these are the things that we should all be forced to read and discuss at some point in our education. So, you should read it whenever it strikes your fancy.\n\nLook, I just love this book and I think it\u2019s amazing. I would agree that it is imperfect, but it has to be. It has to be imperfect. It\u2019s just a fascinating piece of art. So, should you? No. Do you have to? Definitely not.\n\nIf you were Adrian Veidt at the end of Watchmen, would you push the button? Would you drop the squid?\n\nA hundred percent.\n\nReally? It\u2019s that easy for you?\n\nAbsolutely.
