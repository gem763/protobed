In the seven and a half years after the recession ended in July 2009, the real median household income increased by the grand total of less than $1,000.\n\nBecause the median income rose about $400 in the Bush years and fell roughly $400 in the first six months of Obama -- the even more depressing takeaway is that from the first day of George W. Bush\u2019s administration to the last day of Obama\u2019s the median income increased about $1,000.\n\nThis explains why voters \u2013 particularly middle class voters \u2014 were in a sour mood in November 2016. Trump promised to change the policies that up until then led to 16 years of little growth in the average incomes.\n\nThese numbers come from the Census Bureau\u2019s monthly surveys and were recently published by Sentier Research.\n\nIn just two and a half years, these Americans have seen a $4,000 pay raise in real, after inflation dollars, and a tax cut of between $1,400 and $2,900. - -Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform\n\nBut it gets better.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation calculates that the average American household benefited from a $1,400 tax cut, thanks to the GOP-enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. And if your household included a married couple with two children, then the tax cut was $2,900\n\nIn just two and a half years, these Americans have seen a $4,000 pay raise in real, after inflation dollars, and a tax cut of between $1,400 and $2,900.\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more good news.\n\nUnemployment has fallen to 3.5% and all Americans are benefitting. African American unemployment is at a historic low of 5.5% and Hispanic American unemployment is at 3.9%.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nSo why are you watching the talking heads on television repeating themselves day after day about Joe Biden and Ukraine?
