(Mike Segar/REUTERS)\n\nDuring an interview with Buzzfeed\u2019s \u201cAM2DM\u201d Tuesday morning, journalist Ronan Farrow suggested that Hillary Clinton\u2019s team \u201cbecame nervous\u201d over Farrow\u2019s investigative work in exposing disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.\n\n\u201cIt was raised with me as I was trying to schedule an interview with Hillary Clinton for my foreign policy book, for which every other living Secretary of State had agreed to an interview, and she previously had agreed to an interview, that there was an apparent effort to cancel that interview after they raised concerns about the reporting on Weinstein,\u201d Farrow said in the interview.\n\n\u201cIt was an example of how power protects power,\u201d he added.\n\nThe announcement reinforces an October 9 article in the Hollywood Reporter, which alleged that Clinton\u2019s publicist Nick Merrill contacted Farrow in the buildup to a scheduled foreign-policy interview between Clinton and Farrow to state that the Weinstein story was a \u201cconcern for us.\u201d Responding to the story on Twitter, Merrill did not deny the conversation with Farrow.\n\nFarrow said Tuesday that the Clinton team eventually agreed to a \u201cbrief phone interview\u201d after Farrow threatened to disclose the \u201cweird conversation\u201d he had with Merrill.\n\n\u201cHarvey Weinstein was one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s big Hollywood bundlers, he brought in a lot of money for her, they were friends, and it was a personal moment of gut punch to me, like so many of these plot twists in this book, where people that I thought would report that kind of reporting, actually were very leery of it,\u201d Farrow concluded.\n\nFarrow\u2019s book, \u201cCatch and Kill\u201d was released Tuesday, and also alleges that NBC News executives killed his bombshell expose on Weinstein\u2019s misconduct due to concerns that the Hollywood mogul would retaliate by exposing former \u201cToday Show\u201d host Matt Lauer\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct. Farrow ultimately left the company for The New Yorker, where his reporting on Weinstein\u2019s sexual abuses earned the Pulitzer Prize.", "description": "Farrow\u2019s book also alleges that NBC News killed his expose on Weinstein's misconduct over concerns he would expose Matt Lauer\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
