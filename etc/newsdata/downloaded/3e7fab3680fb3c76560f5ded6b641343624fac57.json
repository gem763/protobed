They\u2019re well designed, work flawlessly, and \u2014 importantly \u2014 sound tight as fuck.\n\nWell, today is a good day, because Master & Dynamic has updated the MW07 true wireless with two new models: the MW07 GO and the MW07 PLUS. Great names? Not really, but should you be excited? Definitely.\n\nMW07 PLUS\n\nLook at these beautiful things.\n\nThese are a more common, iterative update. They retail at the same price as the regular MW07 did ($300), but include a range of new features that should iron out most of the shortcomings of the previous model.\n\nI\u2019d say one of the biggest of these was battery life. Out of the case, they only lasted 3.5 hours. To be honest, I only ever wore them long enough to wear the battery out once (I tend to use over ear headphones for longer listening sessions), but appreciate plenty of people need more juice out of their true wireless earbuds.\n\nThis has been addressed with the MW07 PLUS, as they can play music for ten hours, with the case adding a further 30. Which is pretty damn impressive.\n\nOther improvements to the earbuds include new color options (with very shell-influenced designs), and some technical upgrades.\n\nIn regards to the technical side of things, the MW07 PLUS have Bluetooth 5.0 and a connection range of 30 meters. Mic arrays on each earbud in order to provide better call quality, and reduce surrounding sound with its active noise cancellation (ANC) features. Yep, these badgals have ANC. Plus, they come with an ambient mode, so you can hear things when you\u2019re exploring the wild world.\n\nBasically, these all seem like exciting updates for an already great product, so make sure you check back for a more in-depth piece on the MW07 PLUS.\n\n\n\n\n\nMW07 GO\n\nThe full range of MW07 GO colors.\n\nWhile the MW07 PLUS are a pretty common iterative upgrade, the MW07 GO take a different approach. To put it simply, they\u2019re a pair of headphones made for exercise.\n\nIt\u2019s obviously not escaped Master and Dynamic that one of the real benefits of true wireless earbuds is exercising. With them, you have free reign in the gym, never having to worry about wires getting in the way \u2014 and the company has crafted the MW07 GO to focus on this field.\n\nPriced at $200, they\u2019re cheaper than the MW07 PLUS, but come with some nifty features to make the workout experience better.\n\nThe first is weight. According to Master and Dynamic, MW07 GO are 15 percent smaller and lighter than the first generation MW07s. I mean, I never found the originals heavy at all, but less weight can only be a good thing when you\u2019re exercising. One of the reasons this is possible is the company used a TR90 composite (something generally used in glasses frames) to make the earbuds.\n\nThe MW07 GO also have an IPX6 rating, which means they can get a jet of water sprayed at them for a minute without the liquid seeping in. Unless you literally sweat like a hose (in which case, please, go see a doctor), they\u2019ll hold up fine in exercise situations.\n\nOn the topic of battery life, the MW07 GO will last for ten hours on a full charge, which is more than double the average time it takes to run a marathon. If you do intend to get into extreme, long distance running though, the case also provides another 12 hours of juice.\n\nBasically, the MW07 PLUS and MW07 GO seem like intelligent updates to an already great product, and I can\u2019t wait to get my hands on them to see if they live up to the hype.
