I am on the cover of TIME.\u2019\n\nHe continued: \u2018I\u2019ve stared at this cover for a few minutes and it feels like one of those \u201chow the f***kkkk did man get here?!\u201d moments. God\u2019s favour and the ever lasting love and support you guys show me has elevated me to a place in life where this South London kid is worthy enough to grace the cover of the most prestigious publication in the World.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThanking TIME and God for the \u2018huge honour\u2019 of being named a Next Generation Leader, the Vossi Bop rapper continued: \u2018Anyone who knows me knows how much I shy away from being anything other than \u201cMike\u201d.\n\nThe British rapper is making waves abroad (Picture: TIME)\n\n\u2018The thought of being a \u201crole model\u201d or \u201cleader\u201d or whatever it is can often feel way way way too heavy and too overwhelming and a lot of the time [\u2026] I can\u2019t even bare the weight of being myself let alone any of these other titles.\u2019\n\nStormzy added: \u2018I am deeply flawed and still learning how to be a man and still figuring out how to grow into the person I need to be but within all of that confusion and all the juggling of being a human and trying to be a superhuman \u2013 I have purpose. And my purpose has lead me here. Big Mike for TIME ya na.\u2019\n\nOh god, is anyone else emotional?\n\nGot a showbiz story?
