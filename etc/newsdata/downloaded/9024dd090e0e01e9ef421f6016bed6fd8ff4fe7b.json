The cover art of Discipline shows six rows of identical men, all with shaved heads and the same black tops, facing the same direction-all except one.\n\nAfter listening to the album, which is a mixture of electronic music and rhythm and blues, Li did some research on the internet. She found out that the group, consisting of four French indie musicians, Canblaster, Myd, Sam Tiba and Panteros666, has distinctive features.\n\nShe contacted the group and initiated the idea of collaboration, which eventually came to fruition and turned out to be Li's new single, entitled Wa.
