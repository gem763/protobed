Confederation gained almost 7% of the vote.\n\nContext: The parliamentary elections have been described as the most important since the country regained independence in 1989.\n\nThey unfolded against an ongoing dispute between Warsaw and the EU over the rule of law. Late last week, the European Commission announced that it was taking Poland to the EU\u2019s highest court for violating judicial independence.\n\nPoland's domestic shifts could have ramifications for the broader European project. Its European policy will impact those of its neighbors and the likelihood of reaching an EU-wide agreement on the reform of the block.\n\nWhat to watch: The PiS will be empowered to continue its promised reforms, but the opposition control of the Senate will make for a bumpy legislative process.\n\nThe course Poland takes will depend most on how Jaroslaw Kaczynski interprets his party's mandate.\n\nThe stakes for next year\u2019s presidential elections have been dramatically raised, as incumbent President Andrzej Duda will now face a united opposition.\n\nMichal Baranowski is the director of the German Marshall Fund\u2019s Warsaw office.", "description": "Poland's Law and Justice party held a slim majority in the lower house of Parliament.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/OLY-rGVYKuP7Y8KE8PC9_kCRESc=/0x0:3500x1969/1920x1080/2019/10/14/1571074969373.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
