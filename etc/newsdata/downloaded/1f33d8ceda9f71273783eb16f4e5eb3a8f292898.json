In the video, Lowe is seen passing the gun to a teacher and embracing Granados-Diaz in a hug before authorities arrived and placed Granados-Diaz in handcuffs. No one was hurt.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to let him know that I was there for him. I told him I was there to save him. I was there for a reason, and that this is a life worth living,\u201d Lowe told reporters in May, per NBC News. \u201cThe universe works in amazing ways. I\u2019m lucky and I\u2019m happy that I was in that classroom for all those kids and I was able to prevent that tragedy.\"\n\nBreaking News: video of Coach Keanon Lowe disarming Parkrose High School gunman Angel Granados-Diaz.
