The past two quarterly rises translate into annualised prices growth of 2 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms.\n\nInflation forecast is cloudy\n\nHowever, the key underlying measure watched by the RBA - the trimmed mean inflation - came in at 0.4 per cent during the quarter, pushing the annual rate to 1.6 per cent, still undershooting the bank's preferred target of 2 to 3 per cent.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Dr Lowe dampened the importance of hitting that target, saying the bank only looked at medium-term inflation and that there was an \"acceptable degree of variation in inflation\". He emphasised \"the flexibility of our inflation target\" and \"the discretion it allows\".\n\nStill, the September quarter underlying inflation number is the 15th consecutive quarter of below-target inflation for the RBA and comes as an overdue new agreement between Dr Lowe and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on monetary policy is being drawn up.\n\nRBA guidance on further cuts has become even more clouded with the US Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates for the third-straight time overnight, the Australian 10-year bond yield moving back above 1 per cent.\n\nIn addition, established house prices are rising in Sydney and Melbourne and annual economic growth is running at a soft 1.4 per cent.\n\nDr Lowe said both inflation and unemployment were still the chief guides for any further easing and he was confident the economy was going through a \"gentle turning point\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It is reasonable to expect that an extended period of low interest rates will be required in Australia to reach full employment and achieve the inflation target,\" Dr Lowe said.\n\nHowever, there are concerns that inflation might be dragged lower due to the falling cost of essential goods and services.\n\nHouseholds have benefited from falling or lower growth rates in electricity, rent, health and housing. Petrol prices also fell 2 per cent, notwithstanding the September attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities.\n\nThe matter of low rent and construction\n\nOfficial inflation figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed the lowest September quarter rise in household items since 1998.\n\nRents were up only 0.1 per cent in the quarter. The annual growth in Sydney rents is now the lowest on record, so too is the annual growth in the cost of building a new home.\n\nEY economist Jo Masters said that in annual terms, rental inflation is now stuck at a record low of 0.4 per cent year-on-year for the past three quarters. Rent and new home purchases contribute about one-sixth of the overall inflation figure.\n\n\"It's unlikely to accelerate any time soon given the amount of supply coming on the market in Melbourne and Sydney,\" Ms Masters said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBIS Oxford Economics senior economist Sean Langcake said: \"While established house prices have recovered of late, it is the rental market and construction sector that matter for CPI inflation.\"\n\nHowever, higher established home prices - up 3.6 per cent in Sydney and Melbourne in the last four months - may serve to lift some price measures in this housing inflation group.\n\nElectricity prices also fell for the third consecutive quarter, down 1.6 per cent in the September quarter in seasonally-adjusted terms.\n\n\"The introduction of the Default Market Offer and Victorian Default Offer to replace standing offers in the eastern capital cities contributed to the fall,\" ABS chief economist Bruce Hockman said.\n\nEnergy Minister Angus Taylor said on Wednesday the figures pointed to government policy working.\n\n\"This is extremely good news for Australian families, households, small businesses and heavy industry. This is the turn around we wanted to see. We are now seeing it.\"\n\nFollowing the inflation figures on Wednesday the Australian dollar bounced to as high as US68.73\u00a2 from an earlier intraday low of US68.50\u00a2.\n\nThe lower Australian dollar of late is now regarded as having been passed through to higher consumer prices with, clothing and footwear prices increasing by 1 per cent in the quarter, despite subdued consumer demand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRetail sale figures due out on Monday will give a better read on how successful the three interest rate cuts this year have been.\n\nMore stimulus needed?\n\nOther economists are not so sure the RBA will hold the line on interest rates, saying unemployment is still well above the point at which the central banks expects wage growth to accelerate.\n\n\"We think further stimulus is required to boost growth, forecasting the RBA to lower rates further to 0.5 per cent in December,\" NAB economist Kaixin Owyong said.\n\nThe latest labour market report showed the unemployment rate had edged lower to 5.2 per cent which has also helped reduce the urgency to cut rates.", "description": "The likelihood of further interest rate cuts this year has evaporated after key figures showed annual inflation grew 1.7 per cent and could be heading back to where it needs to be for better economic growth.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f4795242713fa1977c6a7bb57f4c6082782822eb", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
