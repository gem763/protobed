Gantz has ruled out participating in an administration with Netanyahu, if the Israeli leader is indicted on looming corruption charges.\n\nSLIGHT DIFFERENCES\n\nThe two main parties\u2019 campaigns pointed to only narrow differences on many important issues: the regional struggle against Iran, the Palestinian conflict, relations with the United States and the economy.\n\nAn end to the Netanyahu era would be unlikely to bring about a significant change in policy on hotly disputed issues in the peace process with the Palestinians that collapsed five years ago.\n\nNetanyahu has announced his intention to annex the Jordan Valley in the occupied West Bank, where the Palestinians seek statehood.\n\nBut Blue and White has also said it would strengthen Jewish settlement blocs in the West Bank, with the Jordan Valley as Israel\u2019s \u201ceastern security border\u201d.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin and his wife Sara casts their votes during Israel's parliamentary election at a polling station in Jerusalem September 17, 2019.

Netanyahu is due to face a pre-trial hearing in October to argue against the charges being filed.\n\nAn election loss could leave him more at risk of prosecution, without the shield of parliamentary immunity that his political allies had promised to seek for him.\n\nThere is no certainty they would stand by a weakened leader without an obvious public mandate in any coalition-building.\n\nNetanyahu portrays Gantz, 60, as inexperienced and incapable of commanding respect from world leaders such as U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nBefore the last election, Trump gave Netanyahu a lift with U.S. recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war. This time, the White House seems more preoccupied with Iran.\n\nThe Trump administration plans soon to release an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan that may prove a dead letter: The Palestinians have rejected it in advance as biased.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s open door in Washington and other world capitals, at a combustible time on Israel\u2019s borders with Syria, Gaza and Lebanon, remains a big draw domestically.\n\nIn the final hours of campaigning, Netanyahu strained every sinew, urging voters to support him to avert what he described as the \u201cdisaster\u201d of a left-wing government.\n\nHis voice hoarse, the veteran leader took to the streets and social media, at one point using a megaphone in Jerusalem\u2019s bus station, to appeal to voters to extend his unbroken decade in power.\n\nSlideshow (16 Images)\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one else running who is worthy of being prime minister,\u201d said Alon Gal, a 53-year-old hi-tech manager. \u201cWith (Netanyahu), at least I know who I am dealing with.\u201d\n\nIn Gaza, Palestinians awaited the results of the vote.\n\n\u201cThis election affects many things in our life,\u201d said Mohamad Abdul Hay Hasaneen, a janitor in the city of Khan Younis. \u201cThere might be limited escalations after the election, but I don\u2019t think this would result in a full war.\u201d", "description": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's battle for political survival looked set to stretch on after exit polls following Tuesday's election showed the race too close to call and Israel's longest-serving leader weakened.", "authors": ["Jeffrey Heller", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430770606&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0LM", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
