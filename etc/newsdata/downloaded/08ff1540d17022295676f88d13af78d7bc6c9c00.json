Salazar was given a four-year ban for doping violations earlier this week.\n\nThe 61-year-old was sanctioned along with endocrinologist Jeffrey Brown for 'orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct' while working with the NOP, USADA said.\n\nThe Nike Oregon Project should be shut down, according to whistle-blower Kara Goucher\n\nInternational Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach called for the World Anti-Doping Agency to investigate all athletes who trained with Salazar, who plans to appeal against the ruling.\n\n'It (NOP) has to go,' Goucher told BBC Sport.\n\n'It's unfortunate but, myself included, I do feel that all of our blood samples over the years should be re-tested now.\n\n'Just because you run for that programme, it does not mean you're doing anything wrong.\n\n'However, we have a conviction here now and many of the NOP athletes that I've seen so far have said they don't trust it, will fight it and are going to stay in that programme - that is very concerning for me.\n\n'I just can't imagine staying when the head of your programme has been convicted, so that part I just don't understand.\n\nAlberto Salazar was given a four-year ban for doping violations earlier this week\n\n'But anyone ever associated with that programme, unfortunately now people will think twice about what you're performing, and that is unfair.\n\n'I know athletes there that are not doing anything wrong, but that's just the unfortunate situation about a conviction like this.\n\n'Alberto is the reason they are in this position - he should be held accountable by his employers (Nike). Instead of them saying, 'We're going to cut ties', they've doubled down to support him.'\n\nBritain's four-time Olympic champion Sir Mo Farah, who is not accused of any wrongdoing, worked with Salazar from 2011 until 2017.\n\nGoucher also claimed that Mo Farah's 'legacy' was 'tainted' by staying with the programme\n\nFarah issued a statement on Tuesday in which he stressed he had 'no tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules or crosses a line'.\n\nHowever, Goucher added: 'Unfortunately for Mo, his legacy is tainted and it is poor judgement. I just can't imagine a scenario where my coach was accused of that and I stayed.\n\n'The investigation was not over - no-one would have blamed Mo for saying, 'I trust Alberto, he's an important person in my life, but until this investigation is closed I cannot be associated with him'. Everyone would have understood that.\n\n'So for him to stay there, it's really sad because now you look back on everything differently, and that doesn't mean he did anything wrong but that's how we look back at it now.'", "description": "Two-time Olympian Kara Goucher trained under Salazar between 2004 and 2011 before making claims against him to the USADA in 2013.
