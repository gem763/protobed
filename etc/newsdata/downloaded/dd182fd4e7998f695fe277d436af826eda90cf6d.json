And that\u2019s putting it kindly.\n\nThey\u2019ve lost six straight games and seven of eight this season, their defense is one of the worst in the league, and their head coach is on the hottest seat in the league.\n\nAnd as they reassess the team during their bye week, the Falcons did the most logical thing they could do: They cut their kicker.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nFalcons release Matt Bryant\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Atlanta announced that it has cut veteran Matt Bryant, who was the longest-tenured player on the team along with quarterback Matt Ryan.\n\nThe 44-year-old Bryant has not had his best season \u2014he\u2019s made 9 of 14 field-goal attempts \u2014 including two of four last Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks, from 51 and 53 yards.\n\nFour of his five misses were from 50 yards or more, and the fact that he\u2019s lined up for six kicks of 50-plus yards in eight games is more of an indictment on the Atlanta offense, but we digress.\n\nBryant is the Falcons\u2019 all-time leading scorer with 1,163 points, but to this point there has been nothing more than a boilerplate post on the team website announcing his release.\n\nIf Bryant has played his last NFL game, he leaves as one of the most accurate kickers ever. In 242 games over 17 seasons with five teams, he made 85.6 percent of his field goals. He made 98.6 percent of his extra-point tries, including just four misses in 390 PATs with Atlanta.\n\nAtlanta signs Younghoe Koo\n\nAtlanta also announced Bryant\u2019s replacement: Younghoe Koo. Koo hasn\u2019t kicked in a regular-season game since 2017, when he was with the Los Angeles Chargers and kicked in four games.\n\nThe Atlanta Falcons cut kicker Matt Bryant, the franchise's all-time leading scorer, on Tuesday.(AP/Ross D.
