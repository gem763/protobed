I'm standing on the top of the mountain talking about Yeezus saying 'I did this. I am a God.'\"\n\nThe mountain he's referring to is his stage design for the Yeezus tour in 2013/14, which also saw a Jesus lookalike appearing on stage.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Kanye's tours usually have extravagant set design\n\nHe spoke about the costs of his creative design on tours, saying that he \"didn't make any money\" from his Yeezus tour, even though it was reported to have made $25 million, being the second highest grossing leg of a tour during 2013, after Paul McCartney.\n\nKanye also commented on his past feud with Drake, saying he wants to get back to \"positive energies\".\n\nHe said: \"God is funny. Drake lives four blocks down the street from me. So that shows you that God has a sense of humour.\"\n\nHe went on to say that he sometimes walks to Drakes house, but doesn't knock on the door to disturb him, instead leaving his mobile number with Drake's security.\n\n\"You cannot be in service to God and be mad at your brother.\"\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.", "description": "The musician spoke about sex addiction, religion, Drake, and running for President in a new interview.", "authors": ["Kirsty Grant", "Newsbeat Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/151B8/production/_109365468_kanye.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
