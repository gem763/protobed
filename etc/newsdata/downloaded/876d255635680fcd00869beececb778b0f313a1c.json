They also pointed out that Iranian officials had placed an arbitrary cap on the number of women who could attend Thursday\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cPart of me is happy, but they have basically created a wall,\u201d said Maryam Shojaei, the sister of Iran\u2019s national team captain, Masoud Shojaei, and one of the leaders of the campaign to allow women into stadiums. \u201cIt\u2019s not what we\u2019ve been asking for. It\u2019s not like everybody can go and sit freely with their brothers, fathers or husbands.\u201d\n\nWhile Azadi stadium holds more than 78,000 spectators, only a few thousand tickets were reserved for women. Those sold out almost as soon as they became available.\n\nDespite the demand \u2014 and the size of the stadium, which remained largely empty on Thursday \u2014 Iranian officials made little effort to increase the allotment.\n\nOnce inside, the women were segregated from men by both empty stretches of seats and metal fencing erected around the sections reserved for women. Fans criticized the enclosure as a \u201ccage,\u201d and monitors kept watch on those inside. In one video posted online, a woman who had help up a sign paying tribute to Blue Girl was soon in a struggle with female police officers who had taken it down.", "description": "The few ticket holders expressed joy at finally being able to share in the passion for the national soccer team, but it was unclear if a ban would be lifted for domestic matches.", "authors": ["Tariq Panja"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/10/sports/10iran-soccer-top/10iran-soccer-top-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
