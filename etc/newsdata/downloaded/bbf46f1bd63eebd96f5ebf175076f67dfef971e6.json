According to organizers, though, there would have been hundreds more people shouting \u201cstop the coup\u201d in Washington\u2019s streets if not for a liberal plot against their buses.\n\nThat\u2019s because, as would-be rally attendees gathered across the East Coast for the US Coachways buses that the organizer had promised would take them to Washington, those buses never showed.\n\nThe no-shows provoked a wave of anger, accusations that the \u201cdeep state\u201d had colluded to stop a show of Trump support in Washington, and negative reviews aimed at US Coachways.\n\nBut US Coachways has a simpler explanation for what happened\u2014it was never paid for the requested buses due to a series of declined credit card payments.\n\n\u201cWe want to get people down there,\u201d Joseph Heap, US Coachways\u2019 chief marketing officer, told The Daily Beast. \u201cBut unfortunately, payment is required.\u201d\n\nFor those who made it to the rally, the missing buses were a subject of anger, consternation, and conspiracies. Rally speaker and One America News personality Jack Posobiec compared the bus issue to social media companies \u201cdeplatforming\u201d conservatives.\n\n\u201cI hear there was a buses issue today,\u201d Posobiec said. \u201cThe company refused to work with folks.\u201d\n\nAnd Women for America First, the organizing group, quickly blasted the bus company in a press release, accusing US Coachways of stopping \u201chundreds of Americans from exercising their first amendment rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cLast night, less than two hours before our first chartered buses were supposed to leave for DC, we were informed that the bus company was cancelling all of our buses\u2014including ones that were fully paid for,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThis move left hundreds of grassroots activists stranded and unable to attend the Anti-Impeachment rally today in front of the Capitol. We are incredibly disappointed at US Coachways, their actions prevented hundreds of Americans from exercising their first amendment rights and to have their voices heard.\u201d\n\nFor those who couldn\u2019t make it because of the absent buses, the vitriol was even more direct. Disappointed Trump fans took to social media and business review sites to vent their frustrations at the company.\n\n\u201cDeep state is diabolical,\u201d tweeted one rallygoer. Another asked Fox News host Tucker Carlson to investigate.\n\nIn the eyes of many Trump supporters, US Coachways soon became just the latest corporation to snub conservatives.\n\n\u201cHow corrupt can the Democrats be?\u201d tweeted one woman whose bus never showed up.\n\nOn YouTube, a stranded rally attendee who calls herself \u201cApril the American\u201d imagined a liberal conspiracy to block the buses as part of a ploy to seize power across the United States government.\n\n\u201cGuess what, you lefty, soy-drinking latte pieces of shit: You\u2019re not taking this country,\u201d she said. \u201cIt ain\u2019t going to happen.\u201d\n\nHeap admitted that he had seen the bad reviews piling up online. And he claimed to have been contacted by conservative media outlets alleging that US Coachways deliberately canceled the bus order to hurt Trump and his supporters. But he suggested that the disappointment of rallygoers be directed at a more mundane culprit: poor planning by one of the event\u2019s organizers.\n\nHeap said one of the rally\u2019s organizers contacted the bus company 10 days before the event, on Oct. 7, and attempted to organize buses in multiple states, including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, New York, and North Carolina. As the event neared, though, the organizer still hadn\u2019t put a deposit down on the buses\u2014potentially leaving US Coachways on the hook for thousands of dollars.\n\nHeap said the organizer only officially confirmed the buses at 3 p.m. on Wednesday afternoon, just hours before the first bus had to leave at 11:30 p.m. Complicating matters, according to Heap, were Department of Transportation regulations that required two drivers for some of the buses.\n\n\u201cThis was not an easy logistical package,\u201d Heap said.\n\nStill, US Coachways agreed to organize the last-minute bus order. But when the company tried to run the organizer\u2019s credit card to pay for the buses, it was repeatedly declined, with only a charge for one of the buses succeeding.\n\n\u201cWe were still there, ready to do this,\u201d Heap said. \u201cBut unfortunately, her credit card kept declining.\u201d\n\nHeap said US Coachways spoke repeatedly to the rally organizer in an attempt to make the credit card payments go through. But when the company could not get the credit card not to decline, he said, \u201cWe had no choice but to cancel.\u201d\n\nDespite issuing a press release blasting the bus company, Women for America First didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment after The Daily Beast brought up US Coachways\u2019 allegation that it wasn\u2019t paid for the buses. The Daily Beast couldn\u2019t reach the rally organizer who attempted to book the buses for comment.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t do this on purpose,\u201d Heap said. \u201cWe really wanted to make this work.\u201d", "description": "The organizers of the \u201cMarch for Trump\u201d claim a bus line tried to kill their rally by not showing up.
