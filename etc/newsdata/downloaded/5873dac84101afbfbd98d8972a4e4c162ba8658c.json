According to documents reviewed by The New York Times, ABG plans to continue running the Barneys digital operation, while Saks would potentially use the Barneys name for private label collections or shop-in shops. Saks' involvement would add a gloss of cutting-edge luxury to the Fifth Avenue retailer, allowing it to further consolidate power over the luxury department store market.\n\nWhile ABG has said it would try to keep Barneys stores open, especially the Madison Avenue flagship, it is prepared to close all seven of them if better rental agreements cannot be reached. It has already lined up the Great American Group to run liquidation sales. No mention was made in its offer of what would happen to employees.\n\nABG is essentially betting that the future of retail lies with the abstract values of brand names rather than in-person shopping experiences.\n\nMr Ben-Avraham and his group, which includes his brother, Uzi Ben-Abraham (owner of the real estate company Premier Equities); Ron Roman (Bergen Logistics); Khajak Keledjian (founder and former chief executive of Intermix); Ron Burkle (Yucaipa Cos., the private equity firm that is already an investor in Barneys); and Andrew Rosen, plans to keep at least two of the remaining seven Barneys stores open, including the Madison Avenue flagship with its nine-floor footprint. It would retain at least some of the current management.\n\nBarneys was founded by Barney Pressman in 1923, evolving from a men's suiting outlet into a symbol of New York style. Alamy\n\nIn an interview, Mr Ben-Avraham said a team was in negotiations with all of the Barneys landlords, though no agreements have been reached. He said his group had raised $US70 million ($104 million) in equity, with plans to raise up to $US150 million ($222.8 million), and had secured commitments for at least $US200 million ($297 million) in debt financing.\n\nHis bet is that combining his brand of downtown cool with Barneys' uptown chic will create a new kind of community destination. \"Our specialty is creating environments people want to be part of,\" he said.\n\nOriginally rumoured to be the first, or so-called stalking-horse, bidder, Mr Ben-Avraham said that he had decided to wait until he had all his financing in place. He said he was committed to trying to save the brand, which he called one of his \"inspirations.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLawyers for Barneys were still working to finalise an agreement with its first formal bidder on Tuesday, according to a 10-minute hearing at the bankruptcy court in Poughkeepsie, New York. The lawyers said that they were working with buyers to \"keep open the option\" of a bid that would avoid liquidation and preserve jobs. They also said that it was possible that certain stores would keep operating under the terms of the initial bid.\n\n\"We expect to work through those remaining issues soon so we can have a signed purchase agreement as soon as possible,\" a lawyer for Barneys said at the hearing. \"These are not easy negotiations and there is a lot of posturing and pressure going on, but our options are relatively limited at this point.\"\n\nNeither ABG, which is run by its founder, Jamie Salter, nor Mr Ben-Avraham has experience operating large department stores.\n\nBusiness built on brand names\n\nABG, which bought the intellectual property of Sports Illustrated for $US110 million ($163.4 million) in May, has built a global business on managing brand names, including the celebrity estates of Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe. In 2016 it teamed up with mall owners Simon Properties and General Growth and two liquidators to buy Aeropostale out of bankruptcy, a deal that could serve as a model for the proposed arrangement with Hudson's Bay.\n\nABG recently sold the right to publish Sports Illustrated to a digital company, which laid off a significant percentage of the publication's staff this month.\n\nMr Ben-Avraham began his career in the mid-1990s with the specialty boutique Atrium, a store that sold Nudie jeans next to Ralph Lauren, before founding Kith in 2011 with designer Ronnie Fieg. It is both a multibrand retailer and one of the best-known streetwear lines.\n\nBarneys was founded by Barney Pressman in 1923. Over the course of three generations of family ownership, it evolved from an off-price men's suiting outlet into a symbol of a certain kind of New York style: unabashedly elitist and very expensive. It grew to encompass womenswear, homewares and childrenswear, and was famous for its rows of black apparel and ability to crown rising fashion stars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt became a victim of its own mythmaking, however, and declared bankruptcy in 1996. It changed hands several times after that, and was sold in 2012 to Richard Perry and his hedge fund, Perry Capital. Mr Perry has by all accounts been an absentee owner in recent years, and has not been involved in the bankruptcy proceedings despite holding a 72 per cent stake in the company and a seat on the retailer's board.\n\nMr Perry closed his hedge fund in September 2016 and has returned the vast majority of clients' money; Barneys is one of the remaining investments it is working to unwind. Josh Hechinger, a spokesman for Mr Perry, declined to comment.\n\nBarneys reported sales of about $US790 million ($1.17 billion) last year, with 30 per cent of that coming from e-commerce, according to its bankruptcy filing. The company, which had 2300 employees when it filed for bankruptcy, said that the 15 stores it planned to close posted losses of $US14.2 million ($21.1 million) last year.\n\nThe luxury chain's challenges came to a head this year, culminating in \"a liquidity crisis\" by the summer. Its rent obligations jumped by $US12 million ($17.8 million) while sales plummeted and vendors started refusing to ship inventory unless they were paid cash on delivery, according to the retailer's bankruptcy documents.\n\nWhether such concerns are resolved by the potential new owners' plans is an open question. Others mentioned as potential bidders include Hilldun Corp., the fashion financing company, and Mercury Group, a Russian retail and real estate group that owns TsUM department store and the Phillips auction house, according to two people with knowledge of the plans, who said they were not authorised to speak publicly.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "Two potential buyers represent starkly different visions for the future of the famous New York luxury retailer and reflect the shift in fashion over the past decade.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2399%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/985bb175d6ce4f2c08eeb9b7be9e09be4bb2f5bb", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
