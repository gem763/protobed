At the beginning of his statement, Shapps appears to have followed Grayling\u2019s text almost to the letter, only substituting Thomas Cook for Monarch and adjusting numbers.\n\nShapps responded on Twitter: 'Although I wasn\u2019t aware that some of these words had been used before, the message in my statement stands true and I will follow through by delivering airline administration reform!'", "description": "Minister has lifted sections of his predecessor Chris Grayling's speech from when Monarch Airlines went bust in 2017 for his address on the collapse of Thomas Cook", "authors": ["Source"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/563d34f0c07d072d9889349dddffe292d1e3d946/51_0_1786_1072/master/1786.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=be4545c94cbf99fd4a2a2ed5e4cf5525", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
