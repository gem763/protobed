Trump \u201cis a guy who amplifies racist tweets; amplifies the tweets of fascists; says things that are deeply objectionable. If I don\u2019t stand up and call that out I think I\u2019m doing a disservice to Londoners who chose me as their mayor.\u201d\n\nKhan and Trump have traded barbs since 2016, when the then-U.S. presidential candidate floated the idea of banning Muslims from traveling to America, and Khan, London's first Muslim mayor, called Trump's views on his religion \"ignorant.\" More recently, Trump called Khan a \"stone cold loser\" on Twitter, and the London mayor fired back, saying the U.S. president's missives were worthy of \"an 11-year-old.\"", "description": "Sadiq Khan renews beef with US president, criticizing him for canceling trip to Poland to commemorate start of World War II.", "authors": ["Jack Blanchard"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1160480701-1200x628.jpg"}
