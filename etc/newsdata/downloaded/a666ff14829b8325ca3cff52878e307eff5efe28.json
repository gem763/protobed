Craig Anderson stopped 19 shots.\n\nOndrej Palat and Luke Witkowski scored for Tampa Bay, and Curtis McElhinney stopped 30 shots.\n\nNamestnikov, drafted by the Lightning in 2011, had notched only an assist in his Senators debut on Thursday after he was acquired from the New York Rangers on Monday.\n\nAgainst Tampa Bay, he scored the tiebreaking goal with 3:03 remaining and added an empty-netter with just seconds left.\n\nThe Senators outshot the reigning Presidents\u2019 Trophy winners 34-21. Tampa Bay looked sluggish at times two days after their soring outburst in a 7-3 win at Toronto.\n\nIt was the third-straight game the Senators faced a backup goalie, as McElhinney started for the Lightning instead of reigning Vezina Trophy winner Andrei Vasilevskiy.\n\nMark Borowiecki nearly broke it open early for the Senators, hitting the crossbar less than a minute into the game. It was a sign of things to come in the opening period as Ottawa outshot the Lightning 12-5 over the first 20 minutes.\n\nBut the Senators - who came into the game last in the league on the power play - couldn\u2019t capitalize on any of their opportunities, including going 0 for 2 with the man advantage.\n\nTampa Bay served two avoidable penalties early in the second. First, the Lightning were caught for having too many men on the ice and then Erik Cernak was whistled for playing the puck with his hands.\n\nThe Senators couldn\u2019t convert on the 5-on-3 or with the man advantage, continuing their scoreless streak on the power play.\n\nHowever, after Brady Tkachuk poked a bouncing puck across to Bobby Ryan as he fell to the ice, Ryan found a wide-open White who ripped a wrist shot over McElhinney\u2019s glove for his first with 6:16 left in the first.\n\nOttawa fans barely had enough time to sit down after they celebrated White\u2019s goal as Palat got his third of the season for the Lightning just 33 seconds later to tie the score.\n\nWith 27 seconds left in the first, Pageau scored his first of the season after chipping in a bouncing puck under Anderson\u2019s glove.\n\nDefenseman Nikita Zaitsev was key on the defensive side, neutralizing Nikita Kucherov and made an important stop early in the third to preserve the Senators\u2018 one-goal lead.\n\nBut Witkowski\u2019s wrist shot from the left circle tied it 2-2 with his first at 8:56 of the third.\n\nIt looked like the Lightning took a 3-2 lead just past the mid-way point of the third, but after a penalty on Tkachuk with 8:10 left made it 4-on-4, a goal by Kucherov was waved off.\n\nNOTES: Senators F Artem Anisimov did not return for the third period after sustaining a lower body injury. \u2026 Tampa Bay\u2019s line of Steven Stamkos, Brayden Point, and Kucherov - who combined for five goals and 11 points in the Lightning\u2019s game against Toronto - were held scoreless.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLightning: At Montreal on Tuesday night.\n\nSenators: Hosts Minnesota on Monday to complete a four-game homestand.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Vladislav Namestnikov scored his first two goals for his new team late in the third period to lift the Ottawa Senators to a 4-2 win over the Tampa Bay Lightning on Saturday for their first win of the season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/12/lightning_senators_hockey_14412_c0-129-3094-1933_s1200x700.jpg?cc1f7280e18627d8eb826680e20ed486aafafc92", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
