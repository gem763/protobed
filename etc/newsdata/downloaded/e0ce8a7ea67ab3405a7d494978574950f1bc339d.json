Email webnews@mirror.co.uk.\n\nSources told the Telegraph it is \"very unlikely\" Robinson, from Portadown, knew about any alleged plans to smuggle migrants into the UK.\n\nPolice were investigating a suspected Irish people-smuggling ring, the report claimed.\n\nRobinson's girlfriend, a hairdresser, is said to be pregnant with twins.\n\nRobinson's parents, who live in Laurelvale in Co Armagh, have flown to England to support him, a neighbour the Belfast Telegraph.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nHis father is the manager of Laurelvale FC, a local amateur club in the Mid-Ulster Football League.\n\nPaul Berry, a local unionist councillor, said he spoke to Robinson's dad, Mark, \"a couple of times\" on Wednesday, but by that point it appeared the family hadn't been told of the arrest.\n\nMr Berry added: \"When I was talking to him nothing had been confirmed to him that it was Mo. The police or nobody of that nature had informed him.\"\n\nHe stressed Mo Robinson was \"innocent until proven guilty\".\n\nIt is believed Robinson picked up the trailer two hours before the migrants were found dead.\n\nTemperatures in the refrigerated container get as low as -25C.\n\nThe trailer had entered England via a freight ferry service from Zeebrugge, Belgium, into Purfleet, Essex, on the River Thames.\n\nBelgian authorities said the container arrived at Zeebrugge at 2.49pm local time on Tuesday and left the Belgian port the same afternoon.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe ferry docked in Essex just after 12.30am on Wednesday and the lorry left the port in Purfleet about 35 minutes later.\n\nThe tractor that hauled it away from the port had come from from Northern Ireland, according to police.\n\nIt had \"Ireland\" emblazoned on the windscreen along with the message \"The Ultimate Dream\".\n\nThe Bulgarian ministry of foreign affairs said the truck was registered in Varna in Bulgaria \"under the name of a company owned by an Irish citizen\".\n\nParamedics were alerted first after the bodies were discovered and Essex Police were notified just after 1.40am.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nThe migrants were found dead in the trailer at the Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays.\n\nBritish authorities are now trying to identify the 39 people who died.\n\nThe lorry was moved to nearby Tilbury Docks so the bodies can be recovered while preserving the dignity of the victims.\n\nBelgium's federal prosecutor's office has launched its own investigation to find out where the trailer originated and how long it had been in the country.\n\nThe office said it is not yet clear when or where the victims entered the container.\n\nC.RO Ports, which manages the ferry terminals in Zeebrugge and Purfleet said it was \"deeply saddened\" and assisting investigators.\n\nThe incident follows warnings from the National Crime Agency and the Border Force of the increased risk of people-smuggling via Belgium.\n\nSecurity checks for people smuggling are believed to be less stringent at both ports than at Calais and Dover.", "description": "The 39 bodies were found in a lorry trailer in Grays, Essex, and it is feared they died in an icy tomb as temperatures in the container can get as low as -25C", "authors": ["Chris Kitching", "Image", "Reuters", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20712626.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-scene-of-crimes-officers-going-into-lory-22.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
