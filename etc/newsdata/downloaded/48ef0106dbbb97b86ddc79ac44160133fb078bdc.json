The consortium received $235,000 from the grant last year, according to Education Department data.\n\nOfficials at Duke and at UNC-Chapel Hill, which houses the consortium, declined to comment. The Education Department declined to say if it\u2019s examining similar programs at other schools.\n\nAcademic freedom advocates say the government could be setting a dangerous precedent if it injects politics into funding decisions. Some said they had never heard of the Education Department asserting control over such minute details of a program\u2019s offerings.\n\n\u201cIs the government now going to judge funding programs based on the opinions of instructors or the approach of each course?\u201d said Henry Reichman, chairman of a committee on academic freedom for the American Association of University Professors. \u201cThe odor of right-wing political correctness that comes through this definitely could have a chilling effect.\u201d\n\nMore than a dozen universities receive National Resource Center grants for their Middle East programs, including Columbia, Georgetown, Yale and the University of Texas. The Duke-UNC consortium was founded in 2005 and first received the grant nearly a decade ago.\n\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos ordered an investigation into the program in June after North Carolina Rep. George Holding, a Republican, complained that it hosted a taxpayer-funded conference with \u201csevere anti-Israeli bias and anti-Semitic rhetoric.\u201d In a response to Holding, DeVos said she was \u201ctroubled\u201d by his letter and would take a closer look at the consortium.\n\nThe department\u2019s findings did not directly address any bias against Israel but instead evaluated whether the consortium\u2019s proposed activities met the goals of the National Resource Center program, which was created in 1965 to support language and culture initiatives that prepare students for careers in diplomacy and national security.\n\nInvestigators concluded that the consortium intended to use federal money on offerings that are \u201cplainly unqualified for taxpayer support,\u201d adding that foreign language and national security instruction have \u201ctaken a back seat to other priorities.\u201d The department cited several courses, conferences and academic papers that it says have \u201clittle or no relevance\u201d to the grant\u2019s goals.\n\n\u201cAlthough a conference focused on \u2018Love and Desire in Modem Iran\u2019 and one focused on Middle East film criticism may be relevant in academia, we do not see how these activities support the development of foreign language and international expertise for the benefit of U.S. national security and economic stability,\u201d the letter said.\n\nInvestigators also saw a disconnect between the grant\u2019s mission and some academic papers by scholars at the consortium. They objected to one paper titled \u201cPerformance, Gender-Bending and Subversion in the Early Modern Ottoman Intellectual History,\u201d and another titled \u201cRadical Love: Teachings from Islamic Mystical Tradition.\u201d\n\nThe letter accused the consortium of failing to provide a \u201cbalance of perspectives\u201d on religion. It said there is \u201ca considerable emphasis\u201d placed on \u201cunderstanding the positive aspects of Islam, while there is an absolute absence of any similar focus on the positive aspects of Christianity, Judaism or any other religion or belief system in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nIt added that there are few offerings on discrimination faced by religious minorities in the Middle East, \u201cincluding Christians, Jews, Baha\u2019is, Yadizis, Kurds, Druze and others.\u201d Department officials said the grant\u2019s rules require programs to provide a \u201cfull understanding\u201d of the regions they study.\n\nJay Smith, a history professor at UNC and vice president of its chapter of the American Association of University Professors, said the letter amounts to \u201cideologically driven harassment.\u201d He said the Education Department official who signed the letter, Robert King, \u201cshould stay in his lane and allow the experts to determine what constitutes a \u2018full understanding\u2019 of the Middle East.\u201d\n\nBut Holding, the Republican who sparked the investigation, said it\u2019s clear the consortium stepped outside the bounds of the grant. The Education Department has an obligation to ensure its funding is used as intended, he said, adding that other schools should make sure they\u2019re following the rules.\n\n\u201cThis has fallen through the cracks, and this could be going on at other educational institutions,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIf the department\u2019s providing the money and giving guidance on how the money is to be used, I think they can be as in the weeds as they need to be.\u201d\n\nThe National Resource Center grant program provided a total of $22 million to language programs at about 40 universities last year. Of that total, about $3.5 million was for Middle East programs.\n\nAlong with its objection to the nature of the UNC-Duke offerings, the department also said it is concerned that, out of 6,800 students enrolled in the consortium\u2019s courses, just 960 were enrolled in Middle East language classes, and that only 11% of the program\u2019s graduates pursue careers in government, while 35% takes jobs in academia.\n\nDepartment officials instructed the consortium to provide a \u201crevised schedule of activities\u201d for the next year and to explain how each offering promotes foreign language learning and advances national security interest.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Trump administration is threatening to cut funding for a Middle East studies program run by the University of North Carolina and Duke University, arguing that it's misusing a federal grant to advance \"ideological priorities\" and unfairly promote \"the positive aspects of Islam\" but not Christianity or Judaism.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Collin Binkley"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/devos_language_funding_76972_c0-0-5137-2995_s1770x1032.jpg?fc0084610e62f26284bef076855da6a0f55ebe7a", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
