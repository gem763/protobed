Here are the details.\n\nThe way it works is super simple:\n\nFirst, just search for the product you\u2019d like to buy on Google on your mobile phone. For instance, let\u2019s say you\u2019re interested in purchasing a new Nintendo Switch Lite. First search for \u201cNintendo Switch Lite.\u201d\n\nWhen the search results page comes up, select the Shopping tab.\n\nWhen you find the specific item you want to buy, tap on it.\n\nOn the next page, you\u2019ll see a toggle for tracking the price. Toggle that on to have Google notify you when the price drops.\n\nThat\u2019s it. If the price never drops, of course, you\u2019ll never get that notification. If it does; however, you\u2019ll know ASAP so you have a chance to snag it at a discount before it sells out. Currently, the feature has only been launched in select markets but a global rollout is expected.", "description": "Google is rolling out a new shopping tool that makes it easy to track the price of an item you\u2019re interested in on the web and find out when it drops in price.
