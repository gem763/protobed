As recently as 2003, coal accounted for half of the country's electricity generation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).\n\nThe EIA expects the power sector will burn less coal this year than it has since 1979.\n\nIn addition to rolling back regulations on coal plants, the administration attempted to use emergency orders to bolster coal.\n\nFor example, Energy Secretary Rick Perry tried to slow the retirement of coal and nuclear plants through a directive in 2017 to subsidize the aging units, arguing those plants make electric grid more resilient, a policy advocated by Murray. Federal regulators rejected Perry's plan, instead electing to study the issue further.\n\nMurray was a donor to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in 2016 and a frequent attendee at events held by the administration, such as the announcement at the Environmental Protection Agency headquarters of its plans to kill the Obama-era Clean Power Plan carbon regulations.\n\nThe White House declined to comment on Murray's bankruptcy filing.\n\nThe company intends to continue operating during the Chapter 11 reorganization with cash on hand and access to $350 million from lenders.\n\nRobert Moore will take over as president and CEO of the company while Murray will head up the board of directors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Valerie Volcovici in Washington; Additional reporting by Scott DiSavino in New York; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Lisa Shumaker)", "description": "As part of a restructuring, founder Robert Murray, a Trump ally and climate change denier, will step down as chief executive and a lender group will take on more than 60% of about $1.7 billion in claims.  \"Although a bankruptcy filing is not an easy decision, it became necessary to access liquidity", "authors": ["Valerie"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wcRVaGDs.HbXdZey93VlOg--~B/aD01MzM7dz03OTk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters-finance.com/368474790ce80d47e3a001e8577feab3", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
