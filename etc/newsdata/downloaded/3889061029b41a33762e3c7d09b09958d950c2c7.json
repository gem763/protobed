He said he felt the injury but wasn't sure how serious it was.\n\n\"I just felt it, then I ran into the wall,\" Thielen said. \"That's about it.\"\n\nIn an interview with ESPN, Thielen said, \"We'll evaluate it, see where it's at after getting an MRI and then hopefully I'll get ready to go. I'm optimistic that I'll be playing and that's all we can do right now.\"\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Adam Thielen sat out the rest of Sunday's game  against the Detroit Lions after his 25-yard touchdown catch in the first ...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
