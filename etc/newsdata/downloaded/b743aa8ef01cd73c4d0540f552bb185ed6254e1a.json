(Photo: Joshua Sudock/Disneyland Resort)\n\nPolice arrested an Orlando, Florida, man Wednesday night on a molestation charge after he allegedly touched a child inappropriately at Disney World.\n\nAccording to an arrest affidavit obtained by USA TODAY, James Anthony Jones, 50, walked by and touched the child with his hand near the cash registers at the Ye Old Christmas Shoppe, located in Magic Kingdom. The child's mother reported the incident, which was captured on surveillance camera footage around 6:15 p.m. EDT, to guest relations. The incident was referred to Disney security and the Orange County Sheriff's Office.\n\nWhen sheriff's deputies arrived to investigate, Disney security officers advised them of a second report of molestation at the Haunted Mansion around 8 p.m. that evening involving an \"older white male with glasses and gray hair.\"\n\nThe second victim told them that a male had touched them as they exited the \"stretch room\" preshow area of the Haunted Mansion ride.\n\nJames Anthony Jones, 50, was arrested on a charge of lewd or lascivious molestation after a Wednesday incident at Disney World.

Jones was brought to the Magic Kingdom security office, where Foro conducted an interview and showed Jones a screenshot from the Christmas store security cameras.\n\nA crime scene investigator collected a DNA sample from Jones and the two victims, and Foro placed Jones under arrest.\n\n\"At this time, due to the close time frame and nearby location of both molestation cases, it is believed that the defendant is also the suspect in the Haunted Mansion incident,\" Foro wrote. \"That case is still under investigation, as hundreds of photographs have to be checked in order to determine if the defendant was in the attraction at the same time as the victim.\"\n\nAccording to online jail records, Jones was booked into an Orange County detention center at approximately 3:30 a.m. Thursday morning.\n\nHe is being held on a charge of lewd or lascivious molestation. His bond is $50,000.\n\nRepresentatives for the State's Attorney's Office for Orange County did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment on the case.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Walt Disney World for comment.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2019/10/18/disney-world-man-arrested-touching-child-park-sheriff-says/4020363002/", "description": "Orlando resident James Anthony Jones, 50, was arrested Wednesday in connection with two reports of molestation at Disney World, police said.", "authors": ["Jayme Deerwester", "Published A.M.
