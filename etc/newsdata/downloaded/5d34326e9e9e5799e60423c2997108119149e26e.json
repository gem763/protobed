But he insisted his fight to topple Sisi will enter a new phase, claiming many junior officers in the army support his call for an end to corruption.\n\nIn an interview with the Guardian in Barcelona, where he says he lives in fear of a contract killing, Mohamed Ali, called for the US Congress to investigate how decades of US economic and military aid amounting to more than $70bn had been spent by the Egyptian state. \u201cTrump has let Sisi steal as much of America\u2019s money as he wants,\u201d Ali said. \u201cIt is like a comedy film.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mohamed Ali\u2019s videos sparked protests last month. Photograph: YouTube\n\nAli\u2019s unscripted handheld viral videos tormenting and ridiculing Sisi sparked an unusual outbreak of dissent last month in Egypt, where the regime has imposed strict economic austerity measures and 2.5% of people live below the poverty line. Small protests that took place over a number of evenings from 20 September were followed by a widespread crackdown in which more than 4,321 people have been arrested, according to rights group the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms.\n\nA specific call from Ali for a million people to march on 27 September was stifled by authorities, who made clear they would use force to quell further demonstrations. He said he has stopped posting the videos for now \u2013 a tacit admission that his ability to bring people out onto the streets had died away.\n\nHe said he is now playing a role in uniting opposition groups, including liberals and the Muslim Brotherhood, into a new force ready to topple Sisi, who came to power in a coup in 2013 and has overseen a wholesale crackdown on freedom of speech and public dissent considered by observers to be the worst in Egypt\u2019s modern history.\n\nAli said he had rejected calls by other opposition groups to join them in exile in Istanbul or Qatar, insisting he wants to stay in Spain.\n\nChain smoking and sometimes agitated as he prowls around the room in which he filmed his video monologues, Ali acknowledged that he is an accidental revolutionary.\n\nThe head of a large construction firm built up over 15 years, Ali raked in substantial profits from army contracts, building an ornate presidential palace for Sisi, intelligence headquarters, and unopened hotels owned by regime members. It was a shady world of patronage, bribes and open ended budgets. \u201cWith the army if you want a contract, you pay commission. If you do not pay a bribe under the table you do not get to do the jobs,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOften there were open budgets. They did not mind how much you spent as long as it looked right.\u201d\n\nHe also partnered with Egypt\u2019s ministry of immigration to produce and star in the 2016 film The Other Land, a drama intended to dissuade Egyptians from attempting risky naval migration routes.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A film poster for The Other Land, produced by and starring Ali.

The falling out, he claimed, left him being owed as much as 200m Egyptian pounds. He said that after ensuring his estranged wife and five children were out of the country, he was determined to expose the scams and waste.\n\nA form of revenge by social media ensued. His regular Facebook denunciations of Sisi\u2019s personal corruption have been shared millions of times, prompting street protests that momentarily appeared to shake the repressive regime.\n\nThe regime have described him as a drug addict, a traitor, a womaniser and member of the Muslim Brotherhood \u2013 the Sunni Islamist grouping that briefly ruled Egypt after the revolution that ousted Hosni Mubarak in 2011 \u2013 all of which he denies.\n\nMany of Ali\u2019s precise claims are unverifiable since he says he has no papers to prove the corruption. But Sisi himself has inadvertently given his tormentor credibility by clumsily confirming that he did indeed order palaces to be built, but that they were for the nation.\n\nThe son of a body builder with no university education, Ali does not pretend to be a political sophisticate. \u201cI am in a state of shock. I do not understand anything. I did not expect this,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a few people following me on Facebook, thought a few people would watch, but it has gone viral and people in Egypt message me saying \u2018you are our hope\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt is a load on me. There are people in prison and tortured. There are people in jail simply for possessing a phone that shows they watched one of my videos.\u201d\n\nAfter his call for further protests failed to meet a popular response, Ali said he was forced to change course. \u201cBefore I used to think I could do this alone. Now I speak to opposition politicians and I have more minds with me. No one can succeed by himself.\u201d He claimed he had a secret plan that he will shortly unveil that \u201cwill surprise the whole world\u201d.\n\nAli said Egypt\u2019s beleaguered opposition has pressed him to explain what his vision for the country might be.\n\n\u201cI said: \u2018I want Egypt to be like Europe, If you want to pray, you pray, if you want to go to the club, you go to the club. Be free. Do you have any problem with that ?\u2019 They said no. The first rule of the constitution must be that the people decide through elections.\u201d\n\nEgypt\u2019s presidential office did not respond to a request for comment, but Sisi has previously denied all allegations of wrongdoing and said he was \u201chonest and faithful\u201d to his people and the military.\n\nAli said he was neither a hypocrite nor motivated solely by revenge. \u201cIf I wanted my money I could have found a way to keep working for them and I would be one of the most important businessmen in Egypt.\u201d He said he acted out of anger at the contrast between Sisi\u2019s calls for austerity and his lavish lifestyle. \u201cThe country is on fire, and they are discussing the size of their kitchen,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI do not take any decision without thinking very carefully and I planned my departure for many years, carefully taking my money out of the country.\u201d\n\nBut for the moment he faces all the dilemmas of a political exile. \u201cThey have taken my nationality from me. My passport expires in a year and if I claim political asylum, I must stay here for a long time and not travel.\u201d Regime loyalists in Egypt, he said, have put a price on his head, or threatened to sue him.\n\nAli claimed the Egyptian embassy in Madrid has invited him there with a promise that he will be repaid the money he says he is owed if he agrees to go quiet.\n\n\u201cI do not think they would kill me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be catastrophic for them if they kill me in Europe, but I am scared of someone being paid to murder me\u201d.", "description": "In interview in Spain, businessman says he is in fear of contract killing and that he has new plan to topple President Sisi", "authors": ["Patrick Wintour"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a9097a2f7e62133c33ba48a29e3c8d6ae76ff67/0_13_2368_1421/master/2368.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0176beb96324ecb51c0a63373574777e", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
