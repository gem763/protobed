Trade tensions remain elevated and economic data continue to show signs of trouble, including among American consumers. But odds for impeachment at PredictIt.com surged to 65%, spooking investors attuned to the effects of political turmoil on financial markets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just another arrow into the mix right now,\u201d said Stephen Carl, a trader at Williams Capital Group. \u201cThe market hasn\u2019t been moving forward with really any conviction,\u201d he said, but \u201cnow we\u2019re dealing with a bunch of geopolitical situations and uncertainties.\u201d\n\nInvestors now face the complicated task of assessing how the House\u2019s move to impeach Trump is likely to impact the economy and financial markets. It changes the calculus in handicapping the trade war, whether prescription drug pricing gets addressed and any other regulatory issues. How, precisely, will be hotly debated on Wall Street.\n\nFor now, anyone unconvinced that impeachment added to Tuesday\u2019s misery need only check the S&P 500\u2019s intraday chart. The biggest decline came when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she\u2019d speak after meeting with committee heads clamoring for action against Trump. Stocks bounced off their lows when Trump said he\u2019d release a transcript of the call at the center of the Ukraine controversy, only to turn lower when Pelosi said she\u2019d open a formal impeachment inquiry.\n\nOvernight, futures edged lower before turning little changed ahead of the open.\n\nThe headlines \u201care contributing to modest weakness in risk markets by mining into a new shaft of uncertainty,\u201d said Shahab Jalinoos, global head of foreign-exchange trading strategy at Credit Suisse. \u201cMarkets are pricing in, as of now, a marginal amount of extra risk premium.\u201d\n\nInvestors flocked to havens such as bonds and gold. Yields on 10-year Treasuries sank nine basis points, the most since mid-August when the bond market surged on recession fears. Gold extended its longest rally in three months. The Cboe Volatility Index jumped above 17 for the first time in nearly 20 days. The dollar tumbled the most in three weeks.\n\n\u201cImpeachment proceedings would likely add to uncertainty within the U.S. economy, which is typically a negative development for the currency,\u201d said Brendan McKenna, a foreign-exchange strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. \u201cIt could weigh on the dollar going forward.\u201d\n\nFor stocks, the sell-off ended three weeks of torpor that saw the S&P 500 sleepwalk back toward a record. After enduring two routs of at least 2% and six 1% rallies during the August tumult, wild swings had become scarce: Before Tuesday the S&P 500 went 12 days without a move of 0.75%. Last week, realized 10-day volatility hit its lowest level in a year.\n\nThere\u2019s precedent for impeachment to rattle stocks. When the House voted to introduce proceedings against Bill Clinton on Oct. 8, 1998, the S&P 500 fell to its lowest level in nine months. The knee-jerk reaction proved a good buying opportunity: from session lows, the S&P 500 would rise 33% by year-end. The reasons for the rally were many, though: it came on the heels of the implosion of Long Term Capital Management, lingering stress in emerging economies from the Asian currency crisis, and a Federal Reserve that cut rates 75 basis points in less than two months.\n\nTo be sure, the goings on in Washington Tuesday weren\u2019t the only threat to risk assets. Cracks in consumer confidence, the bulwark of the economy, became apparent after a U.S. gauge posted its biggest drop since the start of the year as expectations for the economy and jobs market deteriorated. The drop poses a risk to household spending that is underpinning growth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the consumer that\u2019s holding the economy on his or her back,\u201d Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, said by phone. But, \u201ceverything seems to be slow around the edges.\u201d\n\nIn a speech at the United Nations, Trump accused China of currency manipulation, theft of intellectual property, and dumping, sending anxiety swirling that the two nations are still far from reaching a trade deal. Semiconductors, a segment particularly sensitive to trade tensions, led losses.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Just when it seemed U.S. stocks would sleepwalk back to a record, bulls got derailed by a new worry: rising odds that Donald Trump will be impeached.No one\u2019s suggesting that the threat of removing the president from office alone was enough to send equities to the biggest loss in a month", "authors": ["Vildana Hajric", "Sarah Ponczek"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/76v5F3Yilftf7cgrcJgmIQ--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/dd754f2703a0ee40bdad3aa85a40ea80", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
