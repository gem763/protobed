Because if he continues like this, he can find a very good bike in MotoGP for 2021. If I am there also, it would be really cool.\"\n\nThis weekend's Phillip Island race will mark Rossi's 400th grand prix start across all classes, coming more than 23 years on from his 125cc debut in 1996.\n\nThe milestone comes amid a victory drought for the 40-year-old stretching all the way back to the 2017 Dutch TT, while he is also on course to finish the championship behind both Yamaha team-mate Maverick Vinales and star Petronas SRT rookie Fabio Quartararo.\n\n\"I've been racing a long time,\" said Rossi. \"What makes the difference to me is results, when you are doing well, fighting for victory, a podium, it doesn't matter at all.\n\n\"When you are in a tough period like this, everything is more difficult, but I still want to race for a while.\"\n\nGet unlimited access to the world\u2019s best motorsport journalism with Autosport Plus", "description": "Valentino Rossi fears the rider market for the 2021 MotoGP season could move \"too soon\" for him to be able to make a fully-informed decision whether to retire or not", "authors": ["Jamie Klein", "Oriol Puigdemont"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/d1YA_bMCBg.7mpn6hfcMhw--~B/aD0yMDA7dz0zMDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/autosport_578/fce8ef6935f932622c7cf013fd5b0a55", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
