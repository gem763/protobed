The advice that we\u2019re giving our clients is to brace themselves.\n\nWe\u2019re going to see a lot more people detained for longer periods of time in facilities that are not licensed, and significant physical- and mental-health ramifications for the children that we serve. One thing that we might want to do, to the extent that we can, will be to provide more psychosocial services to our minor clients.\n\nO\u2019Leary: A lot of reports the public has gotten about conditions in U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) facilities have been from Flores monitors. If Flores essentially goes away, what rights will attorneys have to visit those facilities, and what will people in the outside world be able to know about them?\n\nRead: If a child is jailed and no one is there to hear him cry\n\nVieux: I suspect nothing. I imagine that the government could say, if Flores goes away, \u201cThat was the reason you could get access to them. But now we don\u2019t have to give you access.\u201d We\u2019ve gone on tours before\u2014the government will give us a tour [of a facility]\u2014so maybe that will continue, but that\u2019s ad hoc. That\u2019s random, and the government certainly has no obligation to give us those tours. So I suspect we\u2019ll get far less information. We\u2019ll be living in darkness, and we\u2019ll just have to guess as to what happens in the facilities or hear from our clients. Oftentimes we\u2019re going to [find out information] when it\u2019s too late for us to actually act, or to put pressure on the administration. It\u2019s going to be a world of darkness.\n\nO\u2019Leary: The administration says that this rule change will deter families from bringing children with them. Based on what you\u2019ve seen, does that hold true?\n\nVieux: No. These families are fleeing persecution, and the reason that they\u2019re making this dangerous journey to the United States and risking their lives, and their children\u2019s lives, is because things back home are far worse for them. They are, in many cases, facing death and significant physical harm. They\u2019re going this route because they feel like they have no other choice. I can\u2019t imagine what we could do to deter someone, or how I would be deterred if I was facing death. I would probably embark on that same journey with my children and simply pray, because my assumption, my hope, my belief, is that what\u2019s on the other side is better than the hell that I\u2019m currently living in.\n\nO\u2019Leary: The Trump administration would say that Congress is not acting and needs to do so. What do you say to that?\n\nVieux: I would certainly make the argument that there is a lot to be said for comprehensive immigration reform. But what the Trump administration is doing is, one, legislating by fiat. They\u2019re arrogating onto themselves rights that Congress did not give them. And, second, the rule of law be damned. A lot of the policies that we\u2019re seeing from this administration have nothing to do with respecting people\u2019s rights. It\u2019s simply seeking to marginalize and demonize. And it\u2019s marginalizing and demonizing in a way that we think is really destructive to the norms that we\u2019ve respected in this country, which is to embrace those who are fleeing something far worse in their homeland, and to give them a process by which they could lawfully make their case and stay here.", "description": "Advocates fear that new Trump-administration rules will leave the public in a \u201cworld of darkness.\u201d", "authors": ["Lizzie O'Leary"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/AP_18171490377666/facebook.jpg?1567609587"}
