However, on Tuesday, a brief Twitter back-and-forth between YouTuber Marques \u2018MKBHD\u2019 Brownlee and Musk led \u2018Treelon\u2019 to spontaneously pledge $1 million, despite claiming that he was broke as a result of his ongoing 'pedo-guy' lawsuit.\n\nOk, sounds legit, will donate 1M trees \u2014 Treelon (@elonmusk) October 29, 2019\n\nMusk's donation has already appeared at the top of the #TeamTree leaderboard and YouTube has publicly pledged to match the entrepreneur\u2019s donation.\n\nCan confirm it's legit. And we'll match the next million to keep #TeamTrees growing\ud83c\udf32 \u2014 B\ud83c\udf83\ud83c\udf83Tube (@YouTube) October 30, 2019\n\nTwitter chief Jack Dorsey has also reportedly pledged to plant 150,000 trees.\n\nOn his donation, Musk left a note that simply read \u201cfor Treebeard\u201d, referring to the Lord of the Rings character, a tree-like creature called an ent who is the caretaker of a vast and ancient forest. Musk also changed his Twitter name to \u2018Treelon,\u2019 because\u2026 why not?\n\nAs is tradition, \u2018Muskovites\u2019 across Twitter shared memes in celebration of their hero\u2019s generosity.\n\nAt the time of writing, Team Trees had already surpassed the $8 million donation mark, though it remains to be seen whether the well-intentioned movement will fizzle out, much like the Notre Dame Cathedral restoration pledge movement did.\n\nAlso on rt.com Quick on pledges, slow on cash: France\u2019s mega rich in no hurry with promised donations to Notre Dame\n\nLike this story?
