(Photo by Chris McGrath/Getty Images)\n\nAtlassian co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes has revealed he will personally be investing in SunCable, an ambitious solar project that when completed will boast the largest solar farm in the world \u2013 spanning 7,500 football fields \u2013 according to the AFR.\n\nBuilt in the middle of the Northern Territory, it will transport the power generated along an underwater cable to Singapore, where it will supply as much as a fifth of the city\u2019s energy needs by 2030.\n\nCannon-Brookes told the AFR that while the project sounds \u201ccompletely batshit insane\u201d, it makes good business sense given the strength of the Australian sun and the country\u2019s proximity to Asia, a region without the space or resources to build its own large-scale renewable projects.\n\nEven one of its biggest backers admits the SunCable project sounds \u201ccompletely batshit insane\u201d when you spell it out.\n\nFirst, you build a solar farm on a scale the world has never seen with a battery system to match in Australia\u2019s dusty Northern Territory. Then you run a 3800-kilometre cable underwater to keep the lights on in Singapore.\n\nBut the \u201cengineering all checks out\u201d, Australian billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes has claimed to the Australian Financial Review (AFR), announcing his intention to personally invest a chunk of his $12.3 billion fortune into the ambitious nation-building project.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m backing it, we\u2019re going to make it work, I\u2019m going to build a wire,\u201d he told the AFR.\n\nThe $25 billion project is expected to take around eight years to complete and will generate more than 20 gigawatts. Solar panels will span 15,000 hectares or around 7,500 football fields next to the Tennant Creek \u2014 a tiny town smack bang in the middle of the Northern Territory, and use Tesla batteries for storage.\n\n\u201cElon [Musk] assures me that his batteries will work at 50 degrees centigrade, which is what they need to do to work in Tennant Creek,\u201d Cannon-Brookes said.\n\nThe SunCable project will move solar from Tennant Creek to Singapore (Google Maps)\n\nFrom there a cable will run alongside the already established railway line, connecting Darwin and Alice Springs before plunging underwater towards Singapore, where it is hoped to provide as much as a fifth of the entire city\u2019s supply.\n\nThe project is expected to contribute $800 million to the Northern Territory\u2019s economy each year, helping alleviate the pressure to turn to fracking, Cannon-Brookes said.\n\nWhile his exact investment is yet to be disclosed, it\u2019s the latest example of Cannon-Brookes putting his money where his mouth is on renewable energy and climate action. Just this week he announced Atlassian would be 100% renewable by 2020 and wholly carbon neutral by 2050.\n\nWith the Australian government lacking any \u201ccredible climate or energy policy\u201d, he said it was now left to business to act.\n\n\u201cWe have the sunniest country outside the Sahara. We have some of the best wind resources in the world \u2013 arguably the best in terms of quantity plus quality. And we have a very close proximity to billions of people who don\u2019t have the available space and/or resources to renewably power those countries,\u201d he told the AFR.\n\nInstead of embracing the opportunity for Australian to capitalise, the government has been actively fighting a transitioning economy, Cannon-Brookes said. He points to their political criticism of Tesla\u2019s South Australian battery \u2013 a project one of his tweets famously helped launch.\n\nTesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you? \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 10, 2017\n\nScott Morrison claimed that it would be as useful as the Big Banana. Resources Minister Matt Canavan reportedly described it as \u201cthe Kim Kardashian of the energy world: it\u2019s famous for being famous [but] doesn\u2019t do very much\u201d. Both were proven wrong.\n\nREAD MORE: By every measure, the giant Tesla battery is a winner for South Australia\n\nNow Cannon-Brookes hopes SunCable will too, and drag Australia into a renewable future it has long been fighting.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
