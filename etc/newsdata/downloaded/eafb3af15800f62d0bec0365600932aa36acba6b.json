Deliveroo and Uber Eats are \u201ca search engine for food\u201d, \u201cno different to Google\u201d and \u201cno different to the social media platforms\u201d. And store splits \u2013 where new stores open inside the customer catchments of existing stores, cannibalising their sales \u2013 have been rebranded \u201cfortressing\u201d. What does Don call cancer? Cell count prosperity?!\n\nOnly on Tuesday, Don\u2019s master franchisor, the New York Stock Exchange-listed Domino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ), downgraded both its international same store sales growth (SSSg) outlook (30 per cent of which are royalties from Don) and its own domestic sales guidance, acknowledging \u201cthe comparable sales drag as we plan to further ramp up our fortressing program\u201d.\n\nIronically, while Don\u2019s is the only Domino\u2019s globally to allege store splits are a positive, it\u2019s also the only to exclude new stores (and existing stores whose territories have been cannibalised by those new stores) from its reported SSSg.\n\nDPZ does not.\n\nAnd DPZ\u2019s next largest licensee (25 per cent of its international sales), the London Stock Exchange-listed Domino\u2019s (DOM), even breaks out the negative impact of its store splits for the market. In the six months to June 30, SSSg in the UK was 3.9 per cent, but only 1.8 per cent when including the impact of splits. That\u2019s 210 basis points of Fortress Downside.", "description": "Domino\u2019s held its annual strategy day on Thursday, which Don Meij devoted to rejigging (again) his eternal growth story.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5771%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_95%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/32f9b65ea0a4cc78f53afa50bce7de7b08307af5", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
