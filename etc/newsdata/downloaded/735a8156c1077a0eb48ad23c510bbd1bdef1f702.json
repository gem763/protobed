I honestly feel sorry for players like Lacazette being surrounded by players like him. https://t.co/tpiHQt84FP \u2014 MK (@MaksKopel) October 29, 2019\n\nI don\u2019t understand why players think Xhaka is a leader on the pitch?! He makes a lot of mistakes and of course his performance on Sunday wasn\u2019t the worst from all the others but he shouldn\u2019t be the captain of Arsenal FC.
