The hall was completely destroyed by shelling and bombing during the war and was rebuilt in 1999 after the International Olympic Committee donated $11.5 million for the project\n\nMist shrouds disused ski-jumping facilities in an area that became a battleground during the bloody 1992-95 conflict that forged Bosnia as a single country. Likewise, the bobsleigh and luge track was used as a Bosnian-Serb artillery stronghold during the war. It is nowadays a target of frequent vandalism.", "description": "Daubed with graffiti and strewn with dry foliage, it is hard to believe that this old bobsleigh track once formed part of state-of-the-art Olympic facilities.", "authors": ["Dado Ruvic"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQ6-VCU1OB2zkHS01KY9d1oaB_MWk4uNhT0Qy9PPrmQdoA5zNkqi16zsDPaQC_QDGjATuaFa7NwB8mJdaGNJpI7W9z1Ky-53NGAEm-IM87iBv", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
