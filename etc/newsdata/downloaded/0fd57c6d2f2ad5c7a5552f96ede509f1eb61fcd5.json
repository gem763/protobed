That\u2019s despite the start of two widely anticipated crude pipelines from West Texas to the Gulf Coast. Plains All American LP\u2019s began service on its Cactus II crude pipeline in August and loaded cargoes for export that month. EPIC Pipeline Co LP started operations on its oil pipe in August as well. But the lines, with a combined capacity of over 1 million barrels a day, may not be in full use.\n\n\u201cA lot of capacity will eventually be online from those pipes, but it would take some time before all of that becomes available. We shouldn\u2019t expect to see all of that show up in one month,\u201d said John Coleman, an analyst at consultant Wood Mackenzie.\n\nAlso, the U.S.-China trade war which has in part weakened global oil prices is affecting demand as well as production. Total U.S. crude production in July fell to the lowest levels since February, according to government data. Chinese buyers reduced their purchases in U.S. crude for August ahead of the start of a 5% tariff on American oil.\n\n\u201cThe U.S.-China trade war is adding to concerns of a weakening economic cycle,\u201d said Fernando Valle, an oil analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cChinese auto sales and industrial production are slowing and consequently the demand for crude from the single-largest importer in the world.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Sheela Tobben in New York at vtobben@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Marino at dmarino4@bloomberg.net, Catherine Traywick\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Newly commissioned Permian Basin crude pipelines have yet to boost U.S. crude exports, as the ongoing U.S-China trade war weighs on demand from Asia.The U.S. Census Bureau said exports averaged 2.73 million barrels a day in August, up just 40,000 barrels from a month before.
