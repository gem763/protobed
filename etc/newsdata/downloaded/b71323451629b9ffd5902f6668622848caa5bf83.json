I really and truly pray that you queued up Unbelievable and watched the first two episodes straight through without leaving for even a cup of tea or trip to the bathroom. It\u2019s hard watching, for sure, especially for victims of sexual assault or rape. But these two episodes are designed to work in unison, a snugly fit-together yin and yang of police procedurals. Without the first, the second reads sticky sweet; without the second, the first is simply documentation of thoughtless neglect.\n\n\u201cEpisode 2\u201d picks up precisely where the last episode left off, with Marie leaning off the edge of a bridge, quivering and unsteady, perhaps about to hurl herself into the cold Washington water below. But something kicks in, and she hoists herself back over the barrier and onto the highway, just as Detective Parker formally closes her case. From there, we only dip back into her story periodically; most of this episode is taken over by an entirely new, though obviously connected, story of rape.\n\n(It\u2019s worth noting here that the chronology gets a little wonky if you aren\u2019t paying close attention. Marie\u2019s story is set in 2008. The rape that takes place this episode is set in 2011. So every time we shift back to Marie, we are also moving back three years in time.)\n\nMerritt Wever, who deserves to have her name yelled in the sing-song Oprah voice whenever it is said, plays Detective Karen Duvall of the police department in Golden, Colorado, a victim\u2019s advocate in every sense. She arrives on the scene of another apartment break-in and assault, this time of Amber Stevenson (Danielle Macdonald, of Dumplin\u2019, who delivers a quietly potent performance), a college student. From the moment Duvall arrives on the scene, the tenor of her investigation is as starkly different from Detective Parker\u2019s as possible.\n\nDuvall\u2019s first concern, beyond any procedure or evidence gathering, is to ask if Amber is okay, and to say it with true warmth in her voice. \u201cLet me know if that changes,\u201d she reassures Amber when she says she\u2019s okay, pointing to the EMTs and reminding her, \u201cThey\u2019re right here, and they\u2019re here for you.\u201d She brings Amber into the quiet and relative comfort of her car, and before launching into any sort of interrogation, begins, \u201cIf it\u2019s alright with you, I\u2019d like to ask you some questions.\u201d Duvall explains exactly why she is asking tough questions, saying that recall is often better in the immediate aftermath of a crime. And most poignantly, she gets to know Amber a little bit as a human, inquiring about her studies, her boyfriend, life in a new place. Admittedly, I teared up \u2014 it was like watching advocacy in action. The language is like a gentle touch.\n\nOf course, this scene is meant to be compared with Parker and his pockmarked partner\u2019s thoughtless interactions with Marie. When the police entered her apartment, Marie was shivering with just a duvet tossed over her, and nobody inquired about her comfort. Parker gets all his background on Marie\u2019s life from a file and then self-assuredly tells her he knows allllll about her without ever asking a question. Does Marie need a breather? Someone to hold her hand? An advocate assigned to her at the hospital? Nobody ever asks \u2014 she\u2019s an information vessel, a means to solve the crime, not of much concern beyond that.\n\nBack in the car, Duvall, with the most dulcet of voices \u2014 someone get Merritt Wever an NPR show, stat \u2014 offers a patient explanation of how rapes have three crime scenes: \u201cthe location, the attacker\u2019s body, and the victim\u2019s body.\u201d What follows is an act of compassion so deep, and a scene so lovingly constructed, that it turns into a work of fine art. Duvall asks if, despite the fact that her rapist has required Amber to shower and scrub her face, she\u2019d mind if the detective tries to gather some DNA from it. We\u2019ve just seen a nurse briskly shine a light up Marie\u2019s spread legs and a police officer bark at her foster mother not to touch anything, so this scene comes across even more starkly. Duvall takes two cotton swabs and slowly \u2014 in complete silence \u2014 runs them across Amber\u2019s peach cheeks, her forehead, her chin, all the while lit from behind like a Dutch still life. Reader, I cried.\n\nDuvall then walks Amber through her apartment and we begin to learn a little more. Her attacker peed a few times while he was there, meaning this was a long, protracted attack. He also put a comforter on Amber when she shivered, not wanting her to be cold. And creepily enough, he told her to put a dowel at the base of the sliding door he came in to rape her, offering a platitude, \u201cYou need to be more protective of yourself,\u201d just after he himself has tortured her.\n\nMore information comes out via Duvall \u2014 that the rapist had been watching Amber, knew delicate things about her, like the fact that she talked to herself in the mirror every night before bed; he also waited until the evening after her boyfriend had left. He\u2019d also previously been inside her apartment, where he stole a ribbon he eventually pulled from his backpack and used to tie her up \u2014 a move so similar to Marie\u2019s shoelaces that it can only be intentional. Then he raped her for four hours at gunpoint. Four hours. Amber kept him talking the entire time, and managed to extract some small bits of helpful biographical information: He speaks four languages, visited a good number of international destinations with military bases on them. And he has a \u201ctheory of humanity\u201d that sounds an awful lot like the sort of shit spewed on the dark web by pathetic, lonely little men who view themselves as the sad victims of wrathful women. He, with his infinite ego, thinks he\u2019s a wolf, and that that is a high mark. After all that, she explains, Amber doesn\u2019t believe this is his first rape.\n\nIt\u2019s only after Duvall (and the audience) learn who Amber is as a person that the details of the crime begin to come out. There\u2019s no forced repetition here, no telling the same story until we\u2019re all sick and the victim is numb. Instead, after Duvall leaves her with a friend who has a hot bath ready, the story emerges. He woke her up with a gun in her face. Dressed her up \u201clike a hooker and a little girl.\u201d Stopped and started again eight times. Took pictures of her (with a flash, just like Marie\u2019s rapist). And Amber has so much detail: his height, weight, that his pubic hair was shaved and he had holes in his sweatpants. That big birthmark on his left calf.\n\nAt times, Duvall\u2019s halo shines a little too brightly (the story of the Isaiah quote in the car, for instance), but nonetheless she\u2019s an artfully constructed character. There is some mystery to her (why all the nebulizer treatments and worry over her daughter\u2019s cold?) and she rules with a leather-gloved iron fist (do NOT submit less than adequate crime-scene reports to her, officers). When she questions Amber\u2019s neighbor about her head-lamp-wearing son \u2014 whom we can probably assume is somewhere on the autism spectrum \u2014 even her graceful handling prickles. The scenes with her husband, Max (Austin H\u00e9bert), a police officer in another town, offer up the best insights. When he asks whether she wants to talk about the case, that brief head shake contains multitudes, yet she can\u2019t help herself from passing along the details. She\u2019s emotionally unzipping, and the release pays off. Max has heard of a similar case in his precinct. The detective in charge might have some good information.\n\nThat detective is the El Camino\u2013driving, tough-talking Grace Rasmussen (Toni Colette), who I hope lays off the rockabilly edge in upcoming episodes, because they\u2019re oversold a wee bit \u2014 we get it, she\u2019s badass. More of her and the backpack-wearing ditch-climber is coming, I\u2019m sure. Nobody keeps Toni Colette in the El Camino.\n\nInterspersed through all of this is Marie in the days after her own rape, snubbed by her friends, given mandatory check-ins and curfews from her counselors, hiding under her hood to keep the press outside her apartment complex from catching a glimpse. Amber certainly is not okay \u2014 no amount of mellow questioning from a well-trained and humane detective vanquishes the trauma of a rape. But Marie is in agony and alone, practically melting down when she looks down at the tray of suggestive roasting weenies she has to give to testy shoppers at the superstore where she works. The lie \u2014 about lying \u2014 is eating up the only stable sections of her already shaky existence. Her former foster father isn\u2019t wrong, per se, when he points out that any blot on his character could undermine the work he does for other kids. But with his implication, \u201cIf you were to ever say anything like that about me \u2026\u201d he only confirms for Marie that this once safe haven is now just another stop on her trail of utter disappointment.\n\nVULTURE NEWSLETTER Keep up with all the drama of your favorite shows!
