Experts say that\u2019s a valuable lesson.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cHaving a parent battling addiction can be one of the most isolating and stressful situations young children and their families face,\u201d Sherrie Westin, president of social impact and philanthropy at Sesame Workshop, said Wednesday in a statement. \u201c \u2018Sesame Street\u2019 has always been a source of comfort to children during the toughest of times, and our new resources are designed to break down the stigma of parental addiction and help families build hope for the future.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSesame Street,\u201d which has aired since 1969, frequently introduces characters with a variety of life circumstances to teach its young viewers empathy for others. A homeless Muppet and a character with autism have made appearances on the show. The latter became controversial last month when it was used in a campaign to encourage early screening and diagnosis of autism. Speculation about the sexual orientations of Bert and Ernie, meanwhile, ran wild when \u201cSesame Street\u201d writer Mark Saltzman said publicly that he had always thought of them as gay.\n\nBy choosing to tackle the sensitive topic of addiction, some experts told The Washington Post that Sesame Workshop got it right. Teaching kids to deal with challenges and to show empathy toward struggling families is a healthy response to the severity of the opioid epidemic, experts in early childhood development and in children hurt by addiction said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s far too many children who are experiencing adverse events, this being one of them, to let this go unaddressed,\u201d said Christy Tirrell-Corbin, executive director of the Center for Early Childhood Education and Intervention at the University of Maryland.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSesame Workshop\u2019s decision to tackle the issue of addiction was greeted mostly with applause from people who said the resources help break down stigma, suggest ways to cope with trauma and teach kids that they\u2019re not alone. Some parents and commentators, however, expressed concern that young children were not ready to learn about addiction.\n\nColumnist Jessica Heslam argued in the Boston Herald that \u201cSesame Street,\u201d which is watched by kids as young as 2 years old, should \u201clet toddlers be toddlers.\u201d\n\n\u201cHad \u2018Sesame Street\u2019 created a program dealing with addiction geared toward older kids, that would be a different story,\u201d Heslam wrote. \u201cRolling out a cute character as the face of the drug epidemic that\u2019s marketed to toddlers crosses a line.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOne in 8 children under age 11 in the United States lives with a parent who has a substance-abuse disorder, Sesame Workshop said. That number does not include kids who don\u2019t live with an addicted parent because of separation or divorce, death or incarceration.\n\nAD\n\nIn one of the organization\u2019s videos, Karli, the Muppet whose mom has an addiction, introduces viewers to Salia Woodbury, a real-life 10-year-old whose parents are recovering from addiction. Salia talks about how meditation and journaling have helped her to cope.\n\n\u201cFor any sickness, people need treatment to feel better,\u201d Salia says. \u201cMy mom and dad got treatment, and that makes me feel happier for them. I remember the hard times, but I write down things that I feel inside.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA video called \u201cLending a Hand\u201d teaches that for kids in need of support, \u201cholding the hand of a friend can really help you feel better.\u201d In another video, Karli learns that her mother\u2019s addiction is not her fault.\n\n\u201cI used to feel like a lot of things were my fault, especially my mom\u2019s problem,\u201d she tells her friend Elmo. \u201cBut she told me, no, it was a grown-up problem; it wasn\u2019t because of anything I did. And she said that she loves me, no matter what.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSesame Workshop\u2019s strategy of posting the addiction-related resources online enables caregivers to choose whether to show them to their children and, if so, how they want to discuss the content, Tirrell-Corbin said.\n\nAD\n\nYounger children are concrete thinkers who needs real examples to understand a concept, Tirrell-Corbin said. To convey that addiction is a sickness, a parent might remind a child of when their grandmother was very sick and couldn\u2019t do things she normally could have done. Parents of older children, Tirrell-Corbin said, can offer more specifics about addiction.\n\nCaregivers should think about their child\u2019s stage of development and what they are ready to learn, Tirrell-Corbin said. She said parents should give their kids objective information that avoids judgment, focuses on compassion, and teaches strategies for supporting other people and dealing with your own feelings.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere are very few of us on the face of this earth who are immune to stress and tragedy and events outside of our control, so I think when you talk about that, you help children develop resilience and stress management,\u201d Tirrell-Corbin said.\n\nAD\n\nParental drug addiction is the second-most-common form of recurring trauma for children, after neglect, Tirrell-Corbin said her research shows. That fact, she said, would make her support \u201cSesame Street\u201d if the show addressed addiction in its regular story line, instead of just online. The show could indicate in advance that it planned to tackle the topic so caregivers could choose to opt out, Tirrell-Corbin said.\n\nSesame Workshop decided to create addiction-related videos and articles because children\u2019s organizations that the nonprofit partners with said they needed substance-abuse resources, said Jerry Moe, who advised Sesame Workshop on the initiative. Moe is the national director of the Minnesota-based addiction-treatment nonprofit Hazelden Betty Ford Children\u2019s Program.\n\nAD\n\nSesame Workshop and its advisers aimed to create a variety of materials so caregivers could share the ones that matched what kids already know, Moe said. The video \u201cLending a Hand\u201d never mentions the word \u201caddiction,\u201d while in another video, Elmo asks his father to explain what addiction is.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAre boys and girls ready to hear that?\u201d Moe said. \u201cThat\u2019s up to whatever\u2018s already going on in their lives and making the resources fit the kids and not making the kids fit the resources.\u201d\n\nThe goal was not just to describe addiction, Moe said, but also to teach kids how to talk about their feelings, whom they can approach for help and activities that can help them feel better. The resources are intentionally general so children who need to know details can learn them from family members, Moe said. The generality, he said, also reflects that although the opioid epidemic opened eyes to the need to teach kids about substance abuse, many children\u2019s family members struggle with other kinds of addiction.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The online-only videos addressing substance abuse were greeted overwhelmingly with praise but also received some criticism.", "authors": ["Marisa Iati", "General Assignment", "Metro Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qhXVB2Yo2FRY5P_zcsblr3rJp04=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5M2JN6HK5AI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
