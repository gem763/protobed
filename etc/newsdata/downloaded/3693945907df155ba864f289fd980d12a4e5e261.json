Per the report, Qifan was dissatisfied with current dependence on the United States\u2019 SWIFT and CHIPS payments systems, on which cross-border exchange of the renminbi currently depends. His complaints were on the basis of both U.S. sanctioning using the platforms and their technical limitations. He said:\n\n\u201cSWIFT is an outdated, inefficient and costly payment system. Since the establishment of SWIFT 46 years ago, the technology has been updated slowly and the efficiency has been relatively low.\u201d\n\nThe bank\u2019s progress with its digital currency\n\nChina\u2019s central bank first announced that its digital currency was ready in August. In September, the central bank said in apparently contradicting comments that China has no specific launch date in mind for its digital currency. According to Global Times, PBoC still needed time to research, test, evaluate and prevent risks.\n\nThe Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress in China recently passed a new law regulating cryptography on Oct. 26 that will take effect on Jan. 1, 2020. The new regulation has also been rumored to be part of preparations for the upcoming Chinese CBDC.\n\nCritics have noted that the CBDC in question is not an actual cryptocurrency. As Cointelegraph reported in August, it will be powered by a two-tier operating system, which will not be fully decentralized.\n\nAdditional reporting by Kollen Post", "description": "An executive of a major Chinese economics think tank said that China will be the first country to successfully roll out a national digital currency", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvYmMzNzk1OGU0MjhmOTMwY2ExMDg0YzE0NTQxNTAwNmMuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
