They\u2019re autonomous adult individuals, and they\u2019re obviously allowed to do what they want to do. But... well, let me put it this way: If they were Republicans, I\u2019d bet you anything they\u2019d be running.\n\nWhy? Because Republicans see our political and party competition in much more existential terms than Democrats do. Republicans understand that the question of who controls the Senate is the whole ballgame. And the Democratic Party just doesn\u2019t.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen if the Democrats don\u2019t take the Senate. Assume they hold the House, and for the sake of argument some Democrat wins the White House. Hooray, hooray. The national nightmare is over. We can maybe get back to doing the people\u2019s business again.", "description": "If not, they should run for Senate.
