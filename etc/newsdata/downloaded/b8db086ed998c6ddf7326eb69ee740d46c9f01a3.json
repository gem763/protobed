Beyond the obvious wallet-friendly perks, there\u2019s something so undeniably gratifying about it \u2014 as if you\u2019ve outsmarted the beauty industry and unlocked one of its precious proprietary secrets. It\u2019s for this reason, whenever I discover a new dupe, I cannot shut up about it: I text every beauty lover I know, post about it on Instagram, and share it here on the Strategist. I\u2019ve even created a Reddit account just to contribute to a beauty-dupe-focused thread. The sneaky, investigative nature of uncovering them is what makes them so incredibly fun to share with friends and likeminded beauty enthusiasts. I mean, some of my holy-grail products (like NYX\u2019s Control Freak Brow Gel, which replaced my Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Gel) came into my life through a friend\u2019s recommendation.\n\nSince it\u2019s Dupes Week on Strat, I knew I had to get my beauty-obsessed followers in on the action. So a few days ago, I put out the call on Instagram, asking them to share their all-time favorite beauty dupes \u2014 breaking down what formula they mimic, why they love it so much, and how much cheaper the product is. Here, a few great beauty dupes that my followers claimed changed their lives.\n\nRio, Strat Writer\n\nSofie Pavitt, Esthetician\n\nPhoebe Gillan, Archiver at Marc Jacobs\n\nThe Ordinary High-Adherance Silicone Primer Dupe for The Benefit POREfessional Face Primer I used to love Benefit\u2019s primer because it completely blurred and knocked out any pores or textural issues so that my skin was super smooth for makeup. But then I found The Ordinary silicone primer, which has similar hydrating and blurring effects but for half the price. It\u2019s so good; I love how long it helps my makeup last. Also, I initially wanted to find a dupe because I noticed Benefit\u2019s primer was actually breaking me out. The Ordinary gives me that same smooth feeling, but I\u2019ve found it\u2019s actually a lot less greasy than Benefit\u2019s primer. $5 at Sephora Buy\n\nJoelle Hyman, Associate Visuals Editor at Allure\n\nDeAnna Varilias, Publicist\n\nCat Garrett, Partnerships at Purple\n\nLili Chemla, Creative Director of Leset\n\nBioderma Atoderm Cream $13 (was $18, now 28% off) Dupe for Biologique Recherche Cr\u00e8me VIP I love the Biologique VIP Cr\u00e8me, but this Bioderma Atoderm Moisturizer has the same texture and gives the same hydrating, brightening results. I always use this Bioderma moisturizer when I\u2019m breaking out because its super simple and extremely hydrating since I overload on products that dry me out during breakouts. $13 at Dermstore Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
