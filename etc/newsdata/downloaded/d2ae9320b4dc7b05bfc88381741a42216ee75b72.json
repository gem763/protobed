Posts found with the taboo emojis will be removed and repeat offenders may have their accounts deactivated\n\n'I suffer - and I appreciate the suffering because we can just feel a little bit of what Jesus felt when we suffer, but social media makes me suffer,' West said in the new interview on Beats1 on Apple Music.\n\n'I suffer from that and by me saying this out loud, I'm sure there's other married men that suffer in a similar way that are happy to hear me say, 'Oh ya, I'm suffering.''\n\nWHAT DO THE NEW GUIDELINES SAY? Criteria 1: Offer or Ask Content implicitly or indirectly* (typically through providing a method of contact) offers or asks for: Nude imagery, or Sex or sexual partners, or Sex chat conversations The new guidelines state that the taboo emojis, like the water drip, cannot be used to mention or depiction sexual activity Criteria 2: Suggestive Elements Content makes the aforementioned offer or ask using one of the following sexually suggestive elements: Contextually specific and commonly sexual emojis or emoji strings, or Regional sexualized slang, or Mentions or depictions of sexual activity (including hand drawn, digital, or real world art) such as: sexual roles, sex positions, fetish scenarios, state of arousal, act of sexual intercourse or activity (sexual penetration or self-pleasuring), or Imagery of real individuals with nudity covered by human parts, objects, or digital obstruction, including long shots of fully nude butts Content must meet Criteria 1 (offer or ask) and be implicitly or indirectly offering or asking for sexual solicitation in order to be deemed violating. For example, if content is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but does not ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not violating. An offer or ask for pornographic material (including, but not limited to, sharing of links to external pornographic websites).\n\nThe rapper, 42, took aim at women - like his wife Kim Kardashian West- who use the platforms to share racy snaps, suggesting these are images that they 'wouldn't have put out' if the apps didn't exist.\n\nBut now with Facebook and Instagram's war on sexual emojis, West and other men like him will not have to worry about suggestive captions along with racy photos.\n\nThe reason three specific emojis are being targeted is because they are used to suggest sexual activities.\n\nThe eggplant emoji has been used to suggest a penis, a peach resembles a buttocks and water drips are in reference to ejaculation.\n\nThey can still be used in captions, but not in a manner that suggests or asks for anything sexual.\n\nThe new guidelines were first brought to light by XBIZ, which reported that Facebook revised its Sexual Solicitation Community Standards between September 7 and October 24, according to The Daily Dot.\n\nThe change is aimed at sex workers who will no longer be able to use the digital icons to sell services on both Facebook and Instagram.\n\nBut the ban could affect other users who simply use the emojis to joke about or talk about sex.\n\nFacebook has also stated that it is against the new policies to use the banned emojis to cover genitalia in pictures that are shared on the platforms.\n\nThe new rules come from section 16 of Community Standards, under 'Sexual Solicitation.'\n\nIn the introduction to this new addition, Facebook states that they draw the line 'When content facilitates, encourages or coordinates sexual encounters between adults.'\n\nAnd there are two new criteria that fall under this section.\n\nThe first being is a user must 'implicitly or indirectly' offer some form of sexual communication, be it 'nude imagery,' sex, or 'sex chat conversations.'\n\nThe second criteria is that content has to have some form of 'sexually suggestive elements.'\n\nAlthough Facebook and Instagram users may be annoyed at the latest change, Kanye West (pictured) should be thrilled to hear the news, as he recently claimed he suffers 'like Jesus' as a result of social media, accusing the apps of fueling sex addiction and tormenting married men'\n\nThe rapper, 42, targeted his suffering at women who - like his wife Kim Kardashian, pictured - use the platforms to share racy snaps that they 'wouldn't have put out' if the apps didn't exist\n\nThat includes, among other things, 'contextually specific and commonly sexual emojis or emoji strings.'\n\nThis means that using one of the emojis deemed sexual can result in your post being removed and repeated us of the digital images, can result in your account being deactivated.\n\nThe social media sites may think they are doing right in the world by banning sexual emojis, but the public feels otherwise.\n\nMany Twitter users are ridiculing Facebook for using its time to ban emojis while letting hate run rampant on its sites.\n\nPerrie Edwards shared a post on Instagram wearing a see-through top, but placed star emojis over her nipples\n\nBella Thorne (left)used the kissing face emoji to cover her nipples in an Instagram post. Miley Cyrus took a nude photo in her bathroom, but covered certain areas with a star emoji\n\n'Facebook's about to start banning people for smutty art and butt shots. They still won't ban Nazis and TERFs because 'free speech,' but god help you if you use an eggplant emoji,' one user shared\n\nThe eggplant emoji has been used to suggest a penis while a peach resembles a buttocks. They can still be used in captions, but not in a manner that suggests or asks for anything sexual, which some users see as a waste of resources\n\n'Facebook's about to start banning people for smutty art and butt shots. They still won't ban Nazis and TERFs because 'free speech,' but god help you if you use an eggplant emoji,' one user shared.\n\nAnother chastised the site for not banning certain images such as confederate flags and MAGA hats.\n\nAmber rose shared a post of herself on Instagram with a see-through top, but covered her nipples with the hear emoji\n\nCelebrities like Blac Chyna (left) and Kylie Jenner (right) are known for sharing the banned emojis in their Instagram captions\n\nusing one of the emojis deemed sexual can result in your post being removed and repeated us of the digital images, can result in your account being deactivated\n\nFacebook has also stated that it is against the new policies to use the banned emojis to cover genitalia in pictures that are shared on the platforms, while some Twitter users would rather see the ban of confederate flags and MAGA hats\n\nAnd this is not the first time there has been a war on emojis \u2013 Instagram has tried to ban the eggplant in 2015.\n\nInstagram confirmed that the eggplant was blocked because it violated their community guidelines, Buzzfeed reported, which revealed users can still search for the gun, syringe and corncob emoji, a search for the eggplant results in 'no tags found'.\n\nThee social media giants are being ridiculed by users who are more concerned about the 'propaganda' and 'racism' on the sites, rather than the hidden meanings of emojis\n\nMany Twitter users are ridiculing Facebook for using its time to ban emojis while letting hate fake news rampant on its sites", "description": "Facebook has updated its guidelines banning posts on its site and Instagram that use 'commonly sexual emojis' including eggplant, peach and the water drips to put an end to sexual solicitation.", "authors": ["Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/18/20340714-0-image-a-156_1572372626222.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
