This was the site of Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s custom-built house near the town of Skjolden. It was difficult to find, hard to access, and all that remained were the foundations. But as I sat there and looked out across the water, I felt strangely moved. On my return home, I learned of plans to rebuild the philosopher\u2019s house \u2013 remarkably, it still existed. In 1958, it had been moved to the town and re-erected with modifications. The original windows were stored in a barn. At the time, reconstruction of the home in its original location seemed like a pipe dream. The Wittgenstein Foundation in Skjolden wasn\u2019t even formally established until 2014. But in recent years the plan gathered momentum, helped by the owner\u2019s threat to demolish it if it wasn\u2019t bought from him. In March 2017, the county of Sogn og Fjordane and the local bank Luster Sparebank each gave a million Norwegian krona ($110,000) to the project. In May 2018, reconstruction began. Work was completed quickly. Jans, one of the project\u2019s local builders, told me that, with these pre-cut timber homes, \u2018it\u2019s just like building Lego\u2019.\u201d\n\nSalvador Dal\u00ed etching stolen from San Francisco gallery: \u201cThe piece is titled Burning Giraffe (1966), and it was insured, along with all the other works in the gallery\u2019s current show on Geary Street, which is devoted to the famed Surrealist. The thief was caught on surveillance footage taking the piece from its place on an easel, which was momentarily unsecured from a lock-and-cable tether that normally secures it. The footage shows the swindler scooping the piece up into his right arm and immediately carrying it down the street.\u201d\n\nRosemary Goring reviews a new edition of Elizabeth Bowen\u2019s Collected Stories: \u201cA brittle, fearful awareness pervades many of these stories, their characters sensing the hazard of invisible lines that, once crossed, will have irrevocable consequences.\u201d\n\nStephen Hayes and Jonah Goldberg partner with Substack to create new publication. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time that Substack has done this: The company, which announced about $15 million in VC funding over the summer, has until now catered only to individual writers, not larger publications.\u201d\n\nIn search of the real China: \u201cA longtime Hudson Institute scholar, formerly on the staffs of senators Henry Jackson and Daniel Moynihan, Horner is the author of the authoritative two-volume history, Rising China and Its Postmodern Fate: Memories of Empire in a New Global Context (2002) and Grandeur and Peril in the Next World Order (2015). In these\u2014and in his latest, A China Scholar\u2019s Long March\u2014Horner delves among the Chinese archives and in the country itself to find the real China. For Horner, there is nothing inevitable about either the nation-state \u2018China\u2019 or its rising. That\u2019s what makes A China Scholar\u2019s Long March such an indispensable volume.\u201d\n\nEssay of the Day:\n\nWhat is the future of writing under artificial intelligence? John Seabrook takes a stab at answering this question in The New Yorker (with the help of A.I.):\n\n\u201cI glanced down at my left thumb, still resting on the Tab key. What have I done? Had my computer become my co-writer? That\u2019s one small step forward for artificial intelligence, but was it also one step backward for my own?\n\n\u201cThe skin prickled on the back of my neck, an involuntary reaction to what roboticists call the \u2018uncanny valley\u2019\u2014the space between flesh and blood and a too-human machine.\n\n\u201cFor several days, I had been trying to ignore the suggestions made by Smart Compose, a feature that Google introduced, in May, 2018, to the one and a half billion people who use Gmail\u2014roughly a fifth of the human population. Smart Compose suggests endings to your sentences as you type them. Based on the words you\u2019ve written, and on the words that millions of Gmail users followed those words with, \u2018predictive text\u2019 guesses where your thoughts are likely to go and, to save you time, wraps up the sentence for you, appending the A.I.\u2019s suggestion, in gray letters, to the words you\u2019ve just produced. Hit Tab, and you\u2019ve saved yourself as many as twenty keystrokes\u2014and, in my case, composed a sentence with an A.I. for the first time.\n\n\u201cPaul Lambert, who oversees Smart Compose for Google, told me that the idea for the product came in part from the writing of code\u2014the language that software engineers use to program computers. Code contains long strings of identical sequences, so engineers rely on shortcuts, which they call \u2018code completers.\u2019 Google thought that a similar technology could reduce the time spent writing e-mails for business users of its G Suite software, although it made the product available to the general public, too. A quarter of the average office worker\u2019s day is now taken up with e-mail, according to a study by McKinsey. Smart Compose saves users altogether two billion keystrokes a week.\n\n\u201cOne can opt out of Smart Compose easily enough, but I had chosen not to, even though it frequently distracted me. I was fascinated by the way the A.I. seemed to know what I was going to write. Perhaps because writing is my vocation, I am inclined to consider my sentences, even in a humble e-mail, in some way a personal expression of my original thought. It was therefore disconcerting how frequently the A.I. was able to accurately predict my intentions, often when I was in midsentence, or even earlier. Sometimes the machine seemed to have a better idea than I did.\n\n\u201cAnd yet until now I\u2019d always finished my thought by typing the sentence to a full stop, as though I were defending humanity\u2019s exclusive right to writing, an ability unique to our species. I will gladly let Google predict the fastest route from Brooklyn to Boston, but if I allowed its algorithms to navigate to the end of my sentences how long would it be before the machine started thinking for me? I had remained on the near shore of a digital Rubicon, represented by the Tab key. On the far shore, I imagined, was a strange new land where machines do the writing, and people communicate in emojis, the modern version of the pictographs and hieroglyphs from which our writing system emerged, five thousand years ago.\u201d\n\nRead the rest.\n\nPhotos: Purple clouds before the storm\n\nReceive Prufrock in your inbox every weekday morning.
