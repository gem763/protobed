I didn't think about consistency and what I'd want to look like at 50-years-old,' Sophie, who is often candid about her cosmetic surgery, confessed.\n\n'Now that I'm older, I think in a completely different way and the choices I make, whether physical or mental, should be ones I can live with forever.'\n\nShe also advised that cheapest isn't always best when it comes to non-essential operations as it is often 'not durable'.\n\nSophie, who recently had the size of her breasts decreased, will travel to Los Angeles to see a surgeon who will slightly reduce her backside.\n\n'I\u2019m tired of having an a** which doesn\u2019t look natural.

'But I have to blame myself when I've already dragged [my fans] into the process.\n\n'So I have concluded not to share as much of this surgery. No before or after pictures, and no documentation of pain and the experience itself.\n\nBeautician Leah Cambridge, 29, died after receiving a Brazilian butt lift in Izmir, Turkey, earlier this year\n\n'Maybe this will be a small wake up call for anyone considering the cheapest operations.'\n\nAlthough regulated operations are available in the UK, many head abroad for the surgery as it is cheaper.\n\nStatistics show that Turkey is one of the cheapest destinations, with a Brazilian butt lift offered for almost \u00a32,700. Clinics in Mexico, the Czech Republic and Poland also offer cut-price procedures.\n\nThe British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons has warned that as many as one in 3,000 people die after receiving this non-necessary surgery.\n\nExplaining how deaths may happen, they said in May: 'If fat is injected deep into muscle tissue and lower down on the buttocks, there is a risk of incorrectly injecting fat into large veins.\n\n'The fat can then pass around the bloodstream into the lungs, and cause death.'\n\nEarlier this year 29-year-old beautician Leah Cambridge, from Leeds, died after receiving a Brazilian butt lift from a clinic in Izmir, Turkey.\n\nIn 2014, Joy Williams, 24, from London, died after undergoing buttock augmentation surgery in Bangkok, Thailand. Her wounds became infected after the procedure.", "description": "Sophie Elise, 24, of Oslo, who has more than 400,000 Instagram followers, took to her blog to tell fans that she would be heading to America to try and reduce the proportions of her behind.", "authors": ["Jessica Green For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/17/19892744-0-image-a-3_1571414786625.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
