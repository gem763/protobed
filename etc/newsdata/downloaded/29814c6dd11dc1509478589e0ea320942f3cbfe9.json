The trouble with success in a democratic nation is that it leaves its failures behind, still holding votes with which to impede or overturn those to whom it owes its success. So, as Tocqueville also shows, democracy becomes its own unsparing critic. Trump\u2019s educated opponents do not quite realize what has hit them, and they try to identify it as some force hostile to democracy\u2014fascism or authoritarianism or just plain conservatism. In fact, their enemy comes from within their own egalitarianism, of which the vulgar Trump is a truer expression than they are, who constantly promote it but don\u2019t practice it.\n\nTrump is a truer democrat because he opposes globalization, the policy of economic rationality that best suits those who can calculate better, who have greater insight into opportunities\u2014and who hold less inhibiting loyalty to their own country. America\u2019s own Declaration of Independence declares the independence of one people from another, and America\u2019s founders shared a general suspicion of Europe as hostile, unrepublican, and deceitful. They did not want to become citizens of the world like President Obama, except for the restless Tom Paine, who, with his globalized politics, failed to accomplish the transformation that Montesquieu saw could be done better and less conspicuously through commerce.", "description": "", "authors": ["Harvey Mansfield", "City-Journal.Org Democracy-Trump-Tocqueville"], "top_image": ""}
