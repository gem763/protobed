Your overall diet matters, though many people pay little heed. Most guidelines say we should eat five or more servings of fruits and vegetables, but only 1 in 4 people actually does.\n\nAD\n\nWhat are the dietary guidelines for health \u2014 and how might they differ for specific health conditions? And perhaps more important, how can people successfully change their eating patterns?\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFrom a clinical perspective, we do recommend diets based on somebody\u2019s condition,\u201d says Donald Hensrud, a physician at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., who specializes in nutrition and weight management.\n\nThe various diets supported by scientific evidence have greater similarities than differences, Hensrud says. They emphasize real food \u2014 as opposed to processed food \u2014 and they\u2019re mostly plant-based. These include the DASH diet, the Mediterranean diet and a vegetarian diet.\n\nAD\n\nThe DASH diet \u2014 Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension \u2014 may be the most widely researched, beginning with a 1997 study that showed the diet lowered blood pressure in people with hypertension.\n\nRestricting sodium in the DASH diet produced greater reductions in blood pressure, although interpretation of that data is somewhat controversial, says Marla Heller, a registered dietitian who has written extensively about the diet.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSome scientists noted that if you slice the data, the decreased sodium helped only one group \u2014 black women,\u201d Heller says.\n\nThe first DASH diet trial allowed 3,500 milligrams of sodium a day, which is about 1\u00bd teaspoons of table salt, and showed benefits. And in the salt-restricted study, a high-sodium group was included for comparison and those people also benefited from the diet.\n\nAD\n\n(The current recommendation for salt intake from the American Heart Association is 2,300 milligrams, which is about 1 teaspoon.)\n\nSodium may be important, but it\u2019s not the only thing that matters. \u201cWe\u2019ve medicalized food too much. People eat real food,\u201d says Heller, who wrote \u201cThe DASH Diet Action Plan.\u201d She says it\u2019s better to advise people on foods to eat, rather than be hyper-focused on nutrients and calories.\n\nHeller also stresses foods to include, rather than what to avoid: Eat more fruits and vegetables, choose low-fat dairy, and include beans, nuts and seeds. \u201cI focus on meal plans to provide examples of how to put together a healthy diet \u2014 and what you stock your fridge and cabinet with,\u201d she says.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn addition to her five books, Heller hosts a Facebook group that has more than 29,000 members. \u201cThey support each other,\u201d she says, such as offering ways they incorporate more vegetables into their meals.\n\nHensrud wrote \u201cThe Mayo Clinic Diabetes Diet,\u201d which recommends lots of fruits and vegetables and few animal products. There\u2019s a two-week \u201close it\u201d phase, in which people try to add five good habits and break five habits. Habits to break include no eating while watching TV and no sugar, except for what\u2019s in fruit.\n\nAfter that, the guidelines are more general: Eat breakfast, eat fruits and vegetables, eat healthy fats, and move your body. \u201cWe\u2019re not telling people what not to eat,\u201d he says.\n\nAD\n\nThe DASH diet also is good for diabetes, Hensrud says, as long as overall calories are limited. That\u2019s because the main controllable factor for diabetes management is body weight, he says.\n\nAD\n\nKaren Swanson was diagnosed with high cholesterol in 2010. Her doctor wanted to put her on a statin drug, but she parried. Could she try diet and exercise first? Her doctor recommended the DASH diet \u2014 which has been shown to be effective at reducing cholesterol levels. That prompted Swanson to do some research.\n\nShe discovered the importance of exercising 30 minutes per day and limiting her intake of saturated fats. Saturated fats are animal fats \u2014 from meat and full-fat dairy products. Also some oils, such as coconut oil and palm oil, are high in saturated fats.\n\nAD\n\nA review of 15 studies found that cutting down on saturated fats lowered people\u2019s cholesterol levels and decreased their risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\n\u201cPersonally I find the DASH diet overwhelming,\u201d Swanson says. For her, it felt easier to lower saturated fats than salt.\n\nAD\n\nAnd it has worked for her \u2014 her cholesterol numbers went down in the first six months and have stayed relatively level in the nine years since. \u201cIt\u2019s not perfect,\u201d she says, but she has avoided statins.\n\nSwanson began blogging about the strategies she\u2019s learned, such as using soy creamer in her coffee instead of half-and-half, and eating gelato instead of ice cream. She also has a few go-to sauces \u2014 a green sauce and a mustard vinaigrette that she\u2019ll put on everything from salad to a \u201cboring chicken breast.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThere\u2019s a misconception that dietary cholesterol is bad, which has led to confusion about eggs. \u201cThey\u2019re high in cholesterol but not in saturated fat,\u201d Swanson says. Indeed, the current USDA dietary guidelines do not set a limit on cholesterol consumption.\n\nAD\n\nHeller, a dietitian, says she has been getting more referrals from physicians. \u201cDoctors don\u2019t have the time to go through the hows and whys, or to problem-solve with people,\u201d she says. However, nutrition services are not always covered by health insurance.\n\nAD\n\nChanging habits can be hard, but once people see results, such as lower blood pressure or looser clothes, those habits become self-reinforcing, Heller says.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t appreciate the powerful link among lifestyle habits, quality of life and their conditions or diseases,\u201d she says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be drudgery to change your lifestyle, to live a healthy life.\u201d", "description": "What you eat can help with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, pre-diabetes, though many people pay little heed.", "authors": ["Jill U.
