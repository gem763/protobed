Early reviews are calling it a \"masterpiece\" and \"one of [Scorcese's] most satisfying films in decades,\" even going so far as to dub it his \"best crime movie since Goodfellas.\" But for everyone out there who isn't able to go see it on Broadway or just want to be able to pause the nearly four-hour thing for some bathroom breaks, worry not\u2014The Irishman is hitting Netflix just in time for Thanksgiving.\n\nIt isn't the only new and exciting thing headed to the streaming service in November, though. The End of the F***ing World is coming back for a second season, The Crown is back for a third, and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and his bowl cut will be starring in The King when it premieres November 1.\n\nThe absolutely bonkers sci-fi The Man Without Gravity drops the same day, and Alicia Vikander's 1980s mystery Earthquake Bird lands on the 15th, just in case anyone is looking for another Netflix B-movie to fill that Bird Box-shaped hole in your heart.\n\nSo in honor of the new slate of upcoming Netflix releases, here's a list of everything headed to the streaming service in November 2019, with VICE's favorite picks in bold. Enjoy spending your entire Thanksgiving weekend watching hours and hours of a de-aged Robert De Niro trying to convince the Academy that he deserves a Best Actor nomination, everybody!\n\nNovember 1\n\n100% Hotter - Season 1 (November 1)\n\nA Remarkable Tale\n\nAd Vitam - Season 1 (Netflix Original series)\n\nAmerican Son\n\nApache Warrior\n\nAtypical - Season 3 (Netflix Original series)\n\nChristmas Survival\n\nDrive (Netflix Original movie)\n\nElliot the Littlest Reindeer\n\nEuphoria / Euforia\n\nFire in Paradise (Netflix Original movie)\n\nHache - Season 1 (Netflix Original series)\n\nHello Ninja - Season 1 (Netflix Original series)\n\nHoliday in the Wild (Netflix Original movie)\n\nHow to Be a Latin Lover\n\nMaid-Sama! - Season 1\n\nMars - Season 2\n\nQueer Eye: We\u2019re in Japan! - Season 1 (Netflix Original series)\n\nSanta Girl\n\nSpitfire: The Plane that Saved the World\n\nThe Christmas Trap\n\nThe Deep - Season 3\n\nThe King (Netflix Original movie)\n\nThe Man Without Gravity (Netflix Original movie)\n\nThe Tuxedo\n\nTrue: Drabbleapple Harvest (Netflix Original movie)\n\nWe Are the Wave - Season 1 (Netflix Original series)\n\nNovember 4\n\nThe Devil Next Door\n\nNovember 5\n\nShe-Ra and the Princesses of Power - Season 4 (Netflix Original series)\n\nThe End of the F***ing World - Season 2 (Netflix Original series)\n\nNovember 8\n\nBusted! - Season 2 (Netflix Original series)\n\nGreen Eggs and Ham - Season 1 (Netflix Original series)\n\nThe Great British Baking Show: Holiday Special - Season 2 (Netflix Original series)\n\nWild District / Distrito Salvaje - Season 2 (Netflix Original series)\n\nNovember 9\n\nLittle Things - Season 3 (Netflix Original series)\n\nNovember 12\n\nHarvey Girls Forever - Season 3 (Netflix Original series)\n\nJeff Garlin: Our Man in Chicago\n\nNovember 15\n\nGO!
