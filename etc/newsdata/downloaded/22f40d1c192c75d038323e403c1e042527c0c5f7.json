For those not familiar with the Latin alphabet, \u201cI\u201d is quite a ways in. The 13Is was an extremely depressing place to find yourself, so it was probably no accident that our team was coached by the school counsellor \u2013 a tall, perpetually smiling man named Mr Lowndes whose boundless encouragement was matched only by his lack of basic knowledge about the game of rugby union.\n\nOur half-time pep talks were unconventional as Mr Lowndes had clearly decided that even in the midst of a game he was our coach second and our primary pastoral caregiver first. To this end there was very little pointed criticism. In place of a dressing down demanding that we get out there and give it our all, stop dragging our feet and bring the game home, was an equally aggressive speech imploring us to go have the most fun we could and play for the love of the game, which puzzled all of us because regardless of encouragement it is very difficult to enjoy \u2013 let alone love \u2013 a game at which you are objectively and statistically appalling.\n\nMr Lowndes, for reasons best known to him, called tries \u201cmeat pies\u201d. This was possibly to avoid confusion between the phrase \u201cnice try\u201d meaning you did your best and failed, which was said a lot, and \u201cnice try\u201d meaning \u201cwell done scoring points just now\u201d which was said basically never. In fact, looking back as I write this, his need to separate these two meanings was completely unnecessary as they were mutually exclusive.\n\nBut my dad came to every game. Every single game he\u2019d stand by the sidelines while I ran in the backline and panicked as the ball made its way towards me on outside centre. He\u2019d cheer when I took it in my hands, cheer when I immediately threw it in the direction of the wing, cheer when, while doing this, I let out the sound of a terrier being sat on.\n\nMy child and my television: my capacity to be moved by things now extends to 5.30am cartoons | Luke Horton Read more\n\nHe\u2019d cheer when in defence I\u2019d chase after someone with the ball, gaining on them right up until the point I realised I was probably going to catch up and cheer as I slowly dropped back so I didn\u2019t have to tackle them, feigning a stitch, looking theatrically disappointed while a bemused tubby kid took the ball the rest of the way to the tryline at a pace just above a saunter.\n\nThe only time Dad showed any sort of outward disappointment in his son was once, after it had been raining and the whole team decided to slide in the mud after a game, all laughing at how filthy they were getting, I took my jersey off and rubbed it around on the edges of the mud pile at arm\u2019s-length, saying to my teammates \u201cLook! You can get the clothes dirty and stay clean!\u201d Even this just earned a \u201cC\u2019mon, pal\u201d from Dad.\n\nI knew I was bad at rugby. All of us in the 13Is knew we were bad at rugby. Despite what Mr Lowndes told us during training, the best measure of a rugby team was not \u201chow nice they were to each other\u201d.\n\nBut I was the only kid in the 13Is with a dad who was mad about sports. Most other kids had parents that turned up to the odd game for a uninterested clap. Some of them brought a book.\n\nBut I was the only one who sat with his dad on the car ride home and talked about all the moments where he could see that I did \u201can incredible dodge\u201d or was \u201cthinking really tactically\u201d or was \u201cquick on my feet\u201d or any other way that Dad could dress up \u201crunning away\u201d.\n\nAnd for years I thought Dad was just in denial about having a dud kid and I sort of felt sorry for him having to turn up, week after week and have his son let him down. But last week I found myself cheering \u2013 literally cheering \u2013 my eight-month-old boy as he finally, after days of trying, managed to put his whole foot in his mouth. And now I know that when it comes to family, it\u2019s all relative.\n\nDoes having children make you happy? Yes, if you let them | Kenan Malik Read more\n\nBut one Saturday morning I actually went after a kid with the ball. I still have no idea why I did this \u2013 call it a clerical error in the Offices of Fight, Flight & Freeze \u2013 but I can still see this moment in pristine HD even 20 years later.\n\nHe\u2019s just passed the 10m line and I\u2019m right behind him. I can hear his boots hitting the dirt. I can hear my heart in my ears. I can hear Mr Lowndes shouting to everyone to have fun. I can hear Dad shouting go, go go! And then something changes in his voice as I don\u2019t drop back. It turns to a question and then to joy, \u201cGo? Go?! GO!\u201d and I launch myself at this kid\u2019s legs.\n\nI\u2019m low and completely horizontal \u2013 use me as a spirit level to build your deck \u2013 I\u2019m in flight, I\u2019m wrapping my arms around his legs and my shoulder hits his thigh and he falls and he lands on my head and my jersey is muddy and the jersey is ON me and it hurts.\n\nAnd I look to Dad and he\u2019s laughing and clapping and grabbing Mr Lowndes and asking if he saw that.
