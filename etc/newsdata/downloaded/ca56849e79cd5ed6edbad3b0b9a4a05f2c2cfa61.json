Neither Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse nor Detective Superintendent Kenny McDonald have been asked a single question in interview as \u2018subjects\u2019 (potential suspects) \u2013 written answers having been accepted without questioning.\n\nDAC Rodhouse (pictured) and DCI Tudway in particular had numerous difficult questions to answer. In the context of these facts it is crucial to observe the presumption of innocence\n\nBoth were exonerated within four months and were later interviewed as potential witnesses against the more junior officers.\n\nA decision was taken to investigate all five officers for misconduct as opposed to gross misconduct or criminal conduct, notwithstanding the fact that false documentation had been placed before a district judge on oath, in order to obtain the warrants.\n\nTheir source, Carl Beech, was described as having remained consistent \u2018and he is felt to be a credible witness who is telling the truth\u2019.\n\nBut he had not remained consistent and officers failed to disclose seven factors that undermined his credibility.\n\nThe investigation of the three more junior officers proceeded so slowly that all of them had retired by the time any decision was reached. Had disciplinary measures been ordered they could no longer have been imposed.\n\nBoth Detective Inspector Alison Hepworth and Detective Sergeant Eric Sword submitted written answers to questions which were accepted with no cross examination.\n\nThe only officer to be questioned face to face was Detective Chief Inspector Diane Tudway who by reason of the passage of time \u2018was unable to recollect what information was available at what time\u2019.\n\nNo attempt was made to establish what material was available to each officer. This could have been simply achieved by reference to available logs and other documentation. It follows that no effective interrogation of any officer was carried out.\n\nThe complaint was referred by the then Met commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe (pictured in 2017)\n\nBoth Detective Inspector Alison Hepworth (left) and Detective Sergeant Eric Sword (right) submitted written answers to questions which were accepted with no cross examination\n\nHaving agreed with Sir Bernard on October 31, 2016, that this matter should be investigated by the IPCC, I anticipated contact from a senior watchdog official in the early stages of its inquiry, to question me in detail about my concerns over the officers\u2019 conduct.\n\nI was not contacted until July 2018 \u2013 20 months later \u2013 when the \u2018lead investigator\u2019 asked me to make a statement by telephone.\n\nShe informed me she had no legal training, was not fully aware of the process for obtaining warrants and initial attempts to create a statement failed. I agreed to write my own statement and submitted it electronically.\n\nI was shocked to learn that the two most senior officers in Operation Midland \u2013 DAC Rodhouse and DSU McDonald \u2013 had been exonerated more than a year earlier and that \u2018mere misconduct\u2019 was being investigated in preference to gross misconduct or criminal misconduct.\n\nDAC Rodhouse\u2019s immediate superiors, then Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick (pictured in August as No 10 Downing Street) and her successor Patricia Gallan, should have been interviewed about their roles in the investigation\n\nIn the final paragraph of my report on Operation Midland I wrote: \u2018At the conclusion of my interview with the officers on 16/17 August 2016, I formed the view that notwithstanding the many mistakes I have enumerated above (43), the officers had conducted the investigation in a conscientious manner and with propriety and honesty.\u2019\n\nThe only officer to be questioned face to face was Detective Chief Inspector Diane Tudway (pictured on November 11, 2014)\n\nIt appears that the IOPC used these words to justify their findings exculpating all five officers.\n\nIn the preceding paragraphs I had called for a vigorous investigation to be conducted by those with appropriate investigative powers. Prior to any such investigation the officers were presumed to be innocent. Such presumption may or may not have survived a full and proper investigation.\n\nNo \u2018subject\u2019 is to be tried for misconduct or criminal conduct without proper investigation. My concluding observation should not have been used as a basis for failing to carry out a high quality and timely investigation. I did not have the authority to carry out any disciplinary investigation myself.\n\nWritten responses from four of the officers should have been tested by cross examination. All five officers should have been interviewed and cross examined. Junior officers should have been interviewed before the senior officers were exonerated.\n\nThere is no justification for the officer in charge of Operation Midland, DAC Rodhouse, to have been exonerated after four months, more than two years before the junior officers were cleared.\n\nOther Midland officers should have been interviewed. Emails between officers should have been examined. DAC Rodhouse\u2019s immediate superiors, then Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick and her successor Patricia Gallan, should have been interviewed about their roles in the investigation, the briefings they received and their responses.\n\nFormer Conservative MP Harvey Proctor (left), Lord Bramall (centre), and late ex-home secretary Lord Brittan (right) who had their homes raided during Operation Midland\n\nThe tardy publication of the Independent Office for Police Conduct report exonerating all five officers involved in the application for search warrants at the homes of Lord Bramall, Lady Brittan (left with Lord Brittan in 2009) and Harvey Proctor should give rise to public disquiet\n\nDAC Rodhouse and DCI Tudway in particular had numerous difficult questions to answer. In the context of these facts it is crucial to observe the presumption of innocence.\n\nIt is possible that senior officers delegated the drafting, reviewing and presentation of the search warrant applications to fully informed junior officers who were responsible for the errors.\n\nIt is also possible the senior officers knew full well that no judge would grant the applications if they were accurately drafted setting out the undermining factors \u2013 and that junior officers with incomplete knowledge of the operation were deployed to make the applications.\n\nClose examination of logs, minutes from office meetings, policy files, weekly briefings, \u2018Gold Group\u2019 minutes, and emails would have resolved such issues and still could. I readily conclude that one or more of the five officers may not have committed misconduct in the application for warrants.\n\nThe lead investigator must not be made a scapegoat for failings in the IOPC under its director-general Michael Lockwood (pictured), an accountant with many years in local government\n\nTardy publication of the Independent Office for Police Conduct report exonerating all five officers involved in the application for search warrants at the homes of Lord Bramall, Lady Brittan and Harvey Proctor (pictured in July) should give rise to public disquiet\n\nHowever I find it difficult to conceive that no misconduct or criminality was involved by at least one officer. Beech was not consistent. There were numerous undermining facts omitted from the applications.\n\nA rigorous and timely investigation \u2013 headed by a serving or retired chief constable from an outside force \u2013 would have detected the misconduct or criminality.\n\nThis has been my first contact with either the IPCC or the IOPC.\n\nWhilst I have been treated with the utmost courtesy, I have been alarmed by the lack of knowledge of relevant criminal procedure. The \u2018lead investigator\u2019 readily conceded her lack of relevant education, training and experience. She should not have been tasked with this highly-sensitive case.\n\nNeither Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse nor Detective Superintendent Kenny McDonald (pictured) have been asked a single question in interview as \u2018subjects\u2019\n\nShe must not be made a scapegoat for failings in the IOPC under its director-general Michael Lockwood, an accountant with many years in local government.\n\nIt is a matter of profound regret that one of the most unsatisfactory and error-ridden criminal operations in history should be followed by such a lamentably slow and inadequate process.\n\nMaintenance of law and order depends upon the effective oversight of those invested with power. Who guards the guards themselves? A malfunctioning police force has not received the necessary oversight.\n\nThose acting for people shamefully and adversely affected by this chain of events need no assistance from me. The Home Secretary will wish to address these shocking failures.\n\nSir Richard Henriques neither sought nor received payment for this article.", "description": "SIR RICHARD HENRIQUES: The delay in the UK's Independent Office for Police Conduct reaching their findings of almost three years is gross and inexcusable.", "authors": ["Sir Richard Henriques For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/22/19372088-0-image-a-17_1570397688229.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
