All these years, seemed too good to be true.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s set in yet,\u201d he said.\n\nFord followed Brett Gardner\u2019s tying homer with New York\u2019s second straight walk-off shot, and the Yankees rallied from four runs down to beat the Oakland Athletics 5-4 Sunday.\n\nGardner led off the ninth with a homer to right off All-Star closer Liam Hendriks (4-2), and Ford followed by driving a 3-2 pitch into the Yankees bullpen in right-center. The rookie stood at home plate and watched his first pinch-hit homer soar, then tossed his bat high toward the home dugout. Gardner doused him with a water cooler after he circled the bases.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything, which is crazy,\u201d Ford said. \u201cJust a whole rush of emotion.\u201d\n\nFord is from New Jersey and was undrafted as a husky slugger from Princeton in 2013. The 27-year-old played 572 minor league games before his first big league call-up this year, and he\u2019s hit 10 homers in 36 games as an injury fill-in for the AL East-leading Yankees.\n\n\u201cA guy that just has professional at-bats,\u201d Gardner said.\n\nDJ LeMahieu hit a game-ending homer in a 4-3, 11-inning victory over Oakland on Saturday. New York has won six of seven and salvaged a series win against the A\u2019s. The Yankees have won eight straight rubber matches and improved to 90-48, becoming the first team this year to reach 90 victories.\n\nA\u2019s left-hander Sean Manaea pitched one-hit ball over five innings in his first start since shoulder surgery last September, and Oakland led 4-0 after 7 1/2 innings.\n\nThe Yankees loaded the bases in the eighth, got a sacrifice fly from Gleyber Torres and a two-run single by Didi Gregorius to make it 4-3 before Hendriks got the final two outs. New York hasn\u2019t been blanked in 220 games, the second longest streak since at least 1900 behind the Babe Ruth-led Yankees spanning 1931-33.\n\nSheldon Neuse - pronounced \u201cnoisy\u201d - lined a tiebreaking, two-run double for his first major league hit in the seventh for Oakland, and Matt Olson made a stellar defensive play at first base before hitting his 28th homer.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I could think of is I, \u2018Wow, I just put one in play and scored a couple runs and now I\u2019m standing on second at Yankee Stadium,\u2019\u201d Neuse said. \u201cJust took a deep breath, took it all in.\u201d\n\nYankees left-hander J.A. Happ countered Manaea with six scoreless innings of one-hit ball, walking four and striking out five. Adam Ottavino (6-4) pitched a scoreless inning to win.\n\nOakland trails Cleveland by a half-game for the second AL wild card and is a full game behind Tampa Bay for the first spot.\n\nManaea walked three and struck out five with 82 pitches in a stellar return.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all we were looking to get from him and boy he\u2019s got to feel good about that,\u201d manager Bob Melvin said.\n\nThe 27-year-old walked three in the fifth inning but left the bases loaded when Olson dived to stop Mike Tauchman\u2019s grounder and threw from his back to Manaea at the bag.\n\nOlson, last year\u2019s AL Gold Glove Award winner at first, also made an over-the-shoulder, basket catch on the warning track on Gary S\u00e1nchez\u2019s pop foul in the eighth.\n\nSEPTEMBER CALL-UPS\n\nThe Yankees recalled brazen young outfielder Clint Frazier from Triple-A more than two months after sending him down amid a roster crunch. The 24-year-old hit .283 with 11 homers and an .843 OPS in 53 games with New York this season but struggled on defense. He had a walk and two hard-hit outs. Ford pinch-hit for him in the ninth against the right-handed Hendriks.\n\nNew York also recalled right-handers Ryan Dull and Chance Adams from Triple-A, signed left-hander Tyler Lyons to a major league deal and transferred right-hander David Hale to the 60-day injured list.\n\nThe A\u2019s recalled infielder Franklin Barreto and right-hander Paul Blackburn, and also promoted catching prospect Sean Murphy to the majors for the first time. Right-hander Tanner Anderson and second baseman Corban Joseph were designated for assignment.\n\nMOOSE TRACKS\n\nHall of Famer Mike Mussina was honored before the game and threw out the first pitch.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nAthletics: OF Khris Davis returned from paternity leave and batted fifth as the designated hitter. He had two hits.\n\nYankees: RHP Luis Severino (lat muscle injury) pitched one-plus inning for Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, his first appearance of 2019. He allowed a homer and struck out two. \u2026 RHP Dellin Betances (right shoulder impingement) returned to New York after facing hitters at the club\u2019s complex in Florida on Saturday. He expects to throw again Tuesday and is still uncertain about his timeline for a return to game action. \u2026 OF Cameron Maybin (sore left wrist) was held out of the lineup and hasn\u2019t batted in a game since Wednesday. Boone hopes he\u2019ll be back in full swing within a few days.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAthletics: Get Monday off after traveling home, then host the Angels for three games. RHP Mike Fiers (13-3, 3.40) will face Los Angeles RHP Jamie Barria (4-7, 6.10).\n\nYankees: Play a third straight day game in the Bronx on Monday when they open a series against Texas. RHP Masahiro Tanaka (10-7, 4.47) opposes Rangers LHP Mike Minor (11-8, 3.25).\n\n___\n\nFollow Jake Seiner: https://twitter.com/Jake_Seiner\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Through Little League and high school, three years in the Ivy League and six more in the minors, Mike Ford held onto his childhood dream.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jake Seiner"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/01/athletics_yankees_baseball_14708_c0-97-2324-1452_s1770x1032.jpg?8301841a91e6ec6aa3ae982bce24a4d6096f85a8"}
