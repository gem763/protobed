It\u2019s two solutions for one problem. I try to manage this,\u2019 said the Leeds manager.\n\nLeeds kept within two points of Championship pacesetters West Brom thanks to Eddie Nketiah\u2019s goal against West Brom (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018When you manage this, this fact had some difficulties the supporters cannot see. It\u2019s natural people argue with my decision because they don\u2019t have all the reasons I have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Bamford is a great player and Eddie Nketiah is a great player as well. I am forced to make both of them a success this year because if not I am not going to take advantage.\n\n\u2018If one has success I will not be able to take advantage of the other one. This process lasts nine months and we have 46 matches or 50 matches.\n\n\u2018We are in 25 per cent of the competition. We have time in the future so I can find a way both of them will shine.\n\n\u2018If this doesn\u2019t happen it\u2019s not going to be a mistake of mine. In the last press conference I said if Nketiah is not a success here it\u2019s my fault. It\u2019s the same with Patrick.\n\n\u2018I am trying to make this work.\u2019\n\nMORE: What is Unai Emery\u2019s best Arsenal XI and why isn\u2019t he playing it?\n\nMORE: Patrice Evra tells Nicolas Pepe to \u2018build massive body\u2019 in the gym after slow Arsenal start", "description": "Marcelo Bielsa defended his use of Eddie Nketiah after the on-loan Arsenal striker rescued Leeds with a late equaliser against Preston last night.
