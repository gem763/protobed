He previously worked for Bain in various capacities between 1996 and 2010.\n\nWilliams also submitted a report into Bain to the Nugent commission, which has not yet been made public.\n\nOn Thursday he resigned during a speech at the 2019 Finance Indaba, held at the Sandton Convention Centre.\n\nBefore he announced his resignation, he talked about the Bain report he submitted to the commission \"for the first time\".\n\n\"The big finding in my report was that, indeed, as Judge Nugent had concluded, not all relevant documents that Bain had access to where shared with the commission.\"\n\nHe believed the organisation was still \"withholding\", and \"by my measure of full revelation, not doing what they need to do for South Africa\".\n\nThe consultancy did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nWilliams also blamed \"the danger and pressure he was facing\" for his decision.\n\nAccording to remarks sent to the media, Williams told the summit that \"people threatened me or refused to take my meetings, and the entire remedy plan fell flat because no one would engage with me. Public officials pointed me out as the face of corruption in corporate South Africa\".\n\n\n\nSA wasn\u2019t being receptive to someone \"going into a company [accused] of doing wrong and trying to help from the inside\", he said.\n\nWilliams said it was a \"sad reflection\" of the state of SA society that the public appeared unable to accept that someone could return to a company accused of wrongdoing with a bona fide desire to help.\n\n", "description": "Athol Williams publicly announced his resignation from the global management consultancy during a speech on Thursday.", "authors": ["Jan Cronje"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9487/8126daafcbbc4b5286f3c123fbaded54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
