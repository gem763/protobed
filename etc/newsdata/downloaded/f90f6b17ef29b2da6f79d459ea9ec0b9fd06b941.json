From the NOTAM:\n\nALL EMERGENCY/LIFE SAVING FLIGHT (MEDICAL/LAW ENFORCEMENT/FIREFIGHTING) OPERATIONS MUST COORDINATE WITH DOE PRIOR TO THEIR ENTRY INTO THE TFR AT 702-295-0311 TO AVOID POTENTIAL DELAYS.\n\nOne of the two TFRs near Area 51. FAA\n\nThe first TFR covers the northwest edge of restricted airspace above the actual Area 51 facilities, creating an additional buffer surrounding some of the \" most restricted airspace in the world.\" The second TFR is along the southern edge of the Nevada Test and Training Range, according to The Drive.\n\nThe FAA did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\n\"They can't stop all of us\"\n\nThe Facebook event, \"Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us,\" was created as a joke by Matty Roberts. The event posting went viral, leading to a visit from the FBI, a statement from the Air Force warning people to stay away, and became a meme, with rapper Lil Nas X referencing the raid in a music video for an \"Old Town Road\" remix.\n\nThe event eventually morphed into a more conventional \u2014 and legal \u2014 event called Alienstock, an outdoor concert and festival. However, the event was cancelled last week, anticipating a Fyre Festival-esque issue with thousands of people venturing to a relatively remote area that did not have the necessary infrastructure. Roberts described pulling out of the event as \"a fantastic relief\" in an interview with the Las Vegas Review-Journal.\n\nAlienstock is now planned as a music festival in Las Vegas. However, there are concerns that some people may show up to Area 51 anyway, despite the warnings. The Air Force told the Washington Post this summer that Area 51 \"is an open training range for the U.S. Air Force, and we would discourage anyone from trying to come into the area where we train American armed forces. The U.S. Air Force always stands ready to protect America and its assets.\"\n\nArea 51 is a small part of the larger Nevada Test and Training Range. The area has been the subject of conspiracy theories for generations that suggested that the US government was holding proof of extraterrestrial life at the facility, although evidence suggests the site is instead connected with nuclear weapons.", "description": "The original event has been cancelled, but there are concerns that some people may show up at the restricted military outpost anyway.", "authors": ["David Slotnick"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d39cf08100a241d9d3087a4-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
