That would be a tragedy but a tragedy of his own making.\"\n\nTrump, on Tuesday, announced that he would release the full transcript of his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is at the center of the latest controversy Democrats have cited in their push for impeachment.\n\nThe administration reportedly suppressed a whistleblower seeking to report on Trump and Zelensky's phone call, which reportedly involved the president repeatedly urging his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Biden, the frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic nomination. Trump has denied any quid pro quo for foreign aid, but Democrats have portrayed the call as a second attempt for Trump to welcome outside interference in a presidential election.\n\nPELOSI EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST TRUMP\n\nBiden called on Trump to release the full whistleblower report to Congress and comply with other congressional requests. The administration has stonewalled congressional investigations by refusing to comply with subpoenas surrounding the Russia investigation.\n\nWhile House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has repeatedly resisted calls for impeachment, the Ukraine controversy appeared to change her mind. Fox News has confirmed that the speaker planned to announce a formal impeachment inquiry at 5 p.m. ET on Tuesday.\n\nTrump has used the whistleblower controversy to refocus attention on accusations surrounding Biden and his son Hunter's business dealings. Biden allegedly tried to pressure the Ukrainian government into firing a prosecutor who was probing a firm tied to his son.\n\nTrump has denied any wrongdoing in the call with Zelensky, insisting that he never engaged in any quid pro quo for foreign aid.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden suggested on Tuesday that President Trump would only have himself to blame if he faces\u00a0impeachment.", "authors": ["Sam Dorman", "Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News.
