They also noted that several other gas generation projects had been approved already.\n\nBut in a letter, Andrea Leadsom, Secretary for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, said the other projects might not go ahead.\n\nShe said she took into account energy security and affordability, as well as carbon emissions.\n\nSome fossil fuels would be needed, especially to balance out intermittent power from renewables, she said. The secretary also noted that Drax would have substantial battery storage.\n\nAnd the new gas plant would be engineered to allow carbon capture equipment to be fitted in the future.\n\n'Carbon budget blowout'\n\nEnvironmentalists point out that carbon capture technology has been available for decades, but barely used.\n\nThe green legal group ClientEarth said the approval of Drax would take the industry\u2019s carbon emissions way over their projected limit.\n\nThe group's lawyer, Sam Hunter Jones, said: \u201cThe UK has already (approved) more gas capacity than the government\u2019s own forecasts estimate will be required through to 2035.\n\n\u201cApproving Drax\u2019s plant risks a carbon budget blowout, a huge stranded asset requiring propping up by the taxpayer, or a combination of the two.\u201d\n\nThe decision comes as Extinction Rebellion protestors are blockading streets demanding tougher action on climate change.\n\nThe government is meeting current climate targets but veering away from medium-term goals.\n\nLast week, the energy regulator, Ofgem, confirmed that the rate of decarbonisation slowed last year, when it\u2019s supposed to be accelerating.\n\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin", "description": "The Planning Inspectorate had ruled against new gas-fired turbines on climate change concerns.", "authors": ["Roger Harrabin", "Bbc Energy", "Environment Analyst"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/58C5/production/_101652722_drax1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
