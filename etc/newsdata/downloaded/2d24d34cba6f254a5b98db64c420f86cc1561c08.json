He is also serving a 60-year sentence for a federal child pornography conviction.\n\nThe USOPC declined, in a late afternoon teleconference, to comment on the report beyond reading a prepared statement.\n\n\u201cEvery instance related to potential or actual abuse of athletes warrants thorough investigation,\u201d spokesman Mark Jones said. \u201cWe have cooperated with all government inquiries and will continue to do so.\u201d\n\nJones added if there were inquiries on the call, \u201cyou will receive the same answer.\u201d\n\nThe Journal reported that federal prosecutors have spoken with potential witnesses about alleged abuse and misconduct in Olympic sports organizations, including USA Gymnastics and USA Taekwondo.\n\nOne focus of the investigation appeared to be on failures in the Olympic system to respond to signs of widespread child abuse, the newspaper said.\n\nIt said prosecutors have already spoken with some witnesses and have received documents from SafeSport in response to a grand jury subpoena.\n\nThe U.S. Center for SafeSport is the organization formed in 2017 to handle sex-abuse cases in the Olympic world.\n\nThe newspaper also reported that USA Gymnastics said in bankruptcy filings that it has been responding to Justice Department subpoenas as recently as April.\n\nIn response to the report, U.S. Senators Jerry Moran, R-Kan., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., issued a joint statement.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Olympic Committee and its affiliated national governing bodies enabled Larry Nassar by turning a blind eye to criminal conduct and then trying to sweep it under the rug.\n\n\u201cEveryone who allowed abuse to continue must be held responsible for any and all violations of the law.\u201d\n\nUSA Gymnastics said it \u201cis striving to become an athlete-centric organization that keeps athlete safety and well-being at the forefront of everything it does.\u201d\n\nIt added USA Gymnastics has cooperated fully with any governmental investigation and will continue to do so in the future.\u201d\n\nIn a separate statement, USA Taekwondo said: \u201cWhile we are limited in what we can say while legal proceedings move forward, we want to state clearly that above all else, our top priority at USA Taekwondo is the safety of our athletes.\u201d", "description": "The United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) said on Friday it was cooperating with government inquires after it was reported U.S. agencies were conducting a widespread investigation into U.S. Olympic sport organizations.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
