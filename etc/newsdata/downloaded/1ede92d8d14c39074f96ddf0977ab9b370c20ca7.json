It is classified as a terrorist organization by most Nato states.\n\nTurkey says the YPG, the dominant Kurdish group in the Syrian Democratic Forces militia that fought alongside US troops to defeat Islamic State, is an extension of the PKK. It launched an offensive into Syria to crush the group after Mr Trump ordered US forces out of northern Syria last week.\n\nThe comments were greeted with disbelief by senior US officials.", "description": "Donald Trump was accused of undermining his own diplomats when he appeared to endorse Turkey's offensive into Northern Syria and compared the Kurdish groups they claim to be fighting to Islamic State.", "authors": ["Roland Oliphant", "Senior Foreign Correspondent", "Allister Heath", "Sherelle Jacobs", "Stephen Bush"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/16/TELEMMGLPICT000213227775-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqwDgGh3pkom49KxtKngnUa36K9dyKixjq8GqZuuMTIBE.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
