Plane brightens skies with beautiful rainbow trail 1/7 A passenger plane is pictured brightening the skies over Germany as it leaves behind a rainbow-coloured trail. Nick Beyersdorf / SWNS 2/7 The trail is an aerodynamic contrail - or condensation trail - as opposed to the more common jet contrails that are formed of exhaust fumes. Nick Beyersdorf / SWNS 3/7 Aerodynamic contrails occur when a plane lowers the air pressure as it flies, in turn lowering the air temperature and causing condensation to form on the wings. Getty 4/7 This condensation then trails behind as the plane continues forward. Nick Beyersdorf / SWNS 5/7 In humid conditions, the drop in temperature and pressure is such that the droplets of condensation will freeze at varying sizes. Nick Beyersdorf / SWNS 6/7 When the sunlight shines through these different sized droplets, it will refract at different wavelengths, hence the variety of colours that can be seen. Nick Beyersdorf / SWNS 7/7 Photographer Nick Beyersdorf captured the phenomenon from the ground in Bamberg, Germany.
