(AP) - It was a moment Casey O\u2019Brien dreamed about, but thought would never occur.\n\nThe Minnesota walk-on, a four-time cancer survivor, made his first collegiate appearance Saturday in the Golden Gophers\u2019 42-7 victory over Rutgers. O\u2019Brien was the holder on three successful PAT\u2019s for No. 20 Minnesota (7-0, 4-0 Big Ten).\n\nHe was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a rare bone cancer, when he was a freshman in high school. With Saturday\u2019s outcome well in hand, Minnesota coach P.J. Fleck called O\u2019Brien\u2019s No. 14 to hold for the point after for the Golden Gophers\u2019 fourth extra point of the game.\n\nAfter the kick, the entire team mobbed him on the field.\n\n\u201cEverything I\u2019ve gone through was worth it,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cIt\u2019s a moment I\u2019ve been thinking about as a kid. It showed how much those guys cared about me.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien\u2019s parents flew in from Minnesota to witness what Fleck called \u2018the most inspirational thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey said he (O\u2019Brien) would never play,\u201d Fleck noted. \u201cWell, he just played for a 7-0 team. That\u2019s what Minnesota is all about. He\u2019s a motivator and a fighter.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien hasn\u2019t traveled much with the team and nearly got his chance last week at home in Nebraska.\n\n\u201cI was bummed that I didn\u2019t get in,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I went to practice on Sunday and continued to work hard.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien had nine months of chemotherapy and reconstructive knee surgery that lasted more than eight hours after his freshman year of high school. He convinced his doctors to convert from quarterback to placeholder.\n\n\u201cI knew that I needed football in my life, and that had been something that had been there my whole life, and I just wasn\u2019t ready to give it up.\u201d\n\nThe hard work paid off.\n\n\u201cI look at myself as a football player. I just show up and play,\u201d he said.\n\nHe got his chance against Rutgers.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It was a moment Casey O'Brien dreamed about, but thought would never occur.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Everett Merrill"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/19/minnesota_rutgers_football_69052_c0-175-4256-2657_s1200x700.jpg?07675b6464bf892f23a0391b487386d5b2c3e4f5", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
