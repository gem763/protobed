Photo: Tavish Timothy\n\nSophie Helf (@jil_slander) is a computer programmer and writer originally from the Bay Area who currently lives in New York. She is very good at getting lost in Brooklyn.\n\nThis week, Sophie and I talked milkmaid blouses, Co-Star, and putting Glossier products up your nose.\n\nI don\u2019t have Co-Star or any of the personality test apps bc I have no intention of being known, understood,\n\nperceived, or interpreted in any way \u2014 Sophie (@jil_slander) August 28, 2019\n\nThis tweet came to me in a dream I had while I was taking a mild depression nap and it is the truth. Some of us just want to ooze our way through the experience of being alive without being seen as anything at all. The official Co-Star account actually replied with a W. Benjamin quote insinuating that thinking this is destructive, which, so? I am also very destructive.\n\nHas Twitter been a good platform for your jokes? Has it changed your sense of humor in any way?\n\nI\u2019ll be honest and admit that I\u2019ve been thinking of how to answer this for a solid two hours, and so will say that (a) yes, being a complete psycho in 280 characters (plus a maximum of four photos) is truly a joy, and (b) I have always been a gnarled little creep, but Twitter has definitely magnified that side of me. It\u2019s one thing to think that shoving a Glossier product up your nose is funny, it\u2019s another to post it and have other people tell you that yes, it actually is.\n\nHow do you balance your computer programming and your writing and your hilarious internet presence?\n\nI actually manage to keep all three things separate pretty easily. Coding is my day job, so I spend the majority of my weekdays working on that, and then writing happens as it happens \u2014 I\u2019m still pretty new at it, so I only pitch a few times a month, and work on pieces as they come along. As for Twitter, I\u2019m weirdly strict about my usage, and use it mostly just to tweet at this point versus constantly scrolling. I have no attention span whatsoever, so if I look at the feed when I should be working, I\u2019ll lose a solid amount of time to it and probably get upset by something I\u2019ve seen as well. It\u2019s a balance I\u2019ve had to force, but it turns out that not getting pissed off by shit you see online makes you feel weirdly productive and at peace???\n\nI love when amputee-adjacent Instagram accounts follow me expecting inspirational leg content and are confronted instead w thirst traps of me with captions like \"post-nap rosy-cheeked little milkmaid bitch\" \u2014 Sophie (@jil_slander) September 20, 2019\n\nI get a lot of Instagram followers who see that I\u2019m an amputee and expect me to post stuff that\u2019s me running in my fake legs or doing sports. I hate all sports and feeling obligated to be \u201cinspirational\u201d when I don\u2019t feel like it \u2014 mostly I am just chugging coffee and staring out into space. I got what I\u2019ve been referring to as my \u201cslutty little milkmaid blouse\u201d recently and have been taking endless selfies in it (I am obsessed with myself), one of which does have the exact aforementioned caption.\n\nYou\u2019re a double-leg amputee. Is there anything you\u2019re absolutely tired of people assuming or asking about that aspect of you?\n\nBeyond the usual fetishist DM-ers and strangers going \u201comg what happened to you?\u201d I get a little tired of people projecting this weird sort of narrative arc onto my life \u2014 the innocent girl who tragically lost her legs and had to work hard to get where she is now. In reality I have never been innocent. Losing my legs sucked but was not tragic because I did not die, and my various prosthetists and surgeons did way more work than I did to get me walking again. As for where I am now? Living in New York, kind of depressed, going through nicotine withdrawal. Very sexy, very inspiring.\n\nHas using prosthetics changed the way you present yourself on social media at all?\n\nIt definitely varies from site to site. On Instagram my bio is \u201cNYC\u2019s amputee darling,\u201d which is true; on Facebook I\u2019ve only mentioned the leg thing a couple times, because mostly it\u2019s gossipy high-school people on there. On Twitter I\u2019m definitely \u201cthe leg girl,\u201d which I 100 percent lean into \u2014 it\u2019s a little niche I\u2019ve managed to carve out for myself just by being honest and kind of funny about the whole situation. I definitely don\u2019t post constantly about my legs, not because I don\u2019t think people care, but because I don\u2019t care half the time. There\u2019s more to my life than just the prosthetics. But I do very much relish a good leg tweet.\n\nAcne Studios bag almond croissant half-eaten peach Chanel face powder Calvin Klein underwear tiny string bikini Diptique candle glass of white wine copy of Eve Babitz book copy of The Gentlewoman Matisse print latte art and then you DIE ALONE!!!!!! \u2014 Sophie (@jil_slander) September 15, 2019\n\nI\u2019m a little obsessed with the weirdly rigid aesthetic of influencer culture and admittedly got sucked into it myself a while ago in an attempt to look like my life was sexy and interesting (it isn\u2019t) \u2014 I even bought myself a pair of Maryam Nassir Zadeh shoes. Shame. I snapped out of it eventually when I realized that no, I was not getting a Fashion Week invite, and besides, in the end we are all jettisoned into the same great gaping void upon our deaths.\n\nRegarding influencer aesthetic: Be honest, do you wear Glossier products?\n\nOkay \u2026 I confess \u2026 I have some of the \u201cPriming Rich\u201d moisturizer \u2026 My friends got it for me though, I swear \u2026 I\u2019d never spend $38 on a moisturizer \u2026 Though I\u2019ve heard Drunken Elephant is good \u2026 But yes \u2026 I do wear Glossier products \u2026 And you know what? It works beautifully and I\u2019m fucking mad about it.", "description": "An interview with New York-based computer programmer and writer Sophie Helf about writing funny jokes on Twitter, Glossier projects, and how being a double-leg amputee changes her approach to social media.", "authors": ["Taylor Garron"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/04/04-sophie-helf.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
