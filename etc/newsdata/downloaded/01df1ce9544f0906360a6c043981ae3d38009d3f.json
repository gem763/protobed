Her pals in the media are, too, so Hillary turns up in fluffy interviews where she is allowed to blather on and on about her life as a victim. This time the willing enabler is CBS and CBS Sunday Morning host Jane Pauley.\n\nClinton went full DEFCON 1 in the interview, as reported by the network in a preview of Sunday\u2019s show. Not holding back, when asked if it bothers her that the current candidates running for the Democrat nomination don\u2019t bring her name up on the campaign trail, she turns it on Trump and says she thinks he knows he\u2019s an \u201cillegitimate president\u201d. Pauley prompted this response by noting that President Trump still says \u201cLock her up\u201d, when he brings her name up.\n\n\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t kill me because he knows he\u2019s an illegitimate president. I believe he understands that the many varying tactics they used \u2013 from voter suppression and voter purging to hacking to the false stories \u2014 he knows that there were just a bunch of different reasons why the election turned out like it did,\u201d she said.\n\nBless her heart. Voter suppression and voter purging, as Hillary mentions, are the favored tropes used by Democrats when they lose an election. She and Stacey Abrams are singing from the same hymnal. Andrew Gillum used these excuses, too, when he lost the Florida gubernatorial election but he has received the consolation prize of a paying gig on CNN.\n\nA video clip from the show, which will air this weekend, captures Hillary calling the President of the United States \u201ca corrupt human tornado\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou know, Jane, it was like applying for a job and getting 66 million letters of recommendation and losing to a corrupt human tornado,\u201d Clinton added. \u201cAnd so, I know that he knows that this wasn\u2019t on the level. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll ever know what happened.\u201d\n\nThis interview took place, according to the reporting, just hours before Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave her stamp of approval to impeachment inquiries moving forward against President Trump. We all know where Hillary stands on impeachment. Trump is a \u201cclear and present danger\u201d, you know.\n\n\u201cMy view is that, given the latest revelation, which is such a blatant effort to use his presidential position to advance his personal and political interests, there should be an impeachment inquiry opened,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd I think, sadly, there are a number of grounds. But this one is incredibly troubling.\n\nThe president of the United States has betrayed our country. That\u2019s not a political statement\u2014it\u2019s a harsh reality, and we must act. He is a clear and present danger to the things that keep us strong and free. I support impeachment. \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 25, 2019\n\nAs election day moves closer on the calendar, apparently Hillary has decided to ratchet up her rhetoric against Trump and Trump voters. She says in the interview that Trump voters bought into all the lies that were being told about her during the campaign. Translation: Trump voters are stupid and unable to think for themselves. She has no respect for those who disagree with her.\n\nThe truth is that Hillary Clinton ran a really badly executed campaign. She was a really bad candidate. She brought her failure to inspire middle America upon herself. The Electoral College protects the voices that are most often ignored. It is just a bit too rich to hear her criticize the current president as corrupt when she and her husband used their positions to do what she accuses Trump of doing \u2013 using foreign governments for personal purposes. Bill and Hillary Clinton have gotten fabulously wealthy off government service. Trump was already a wealthy man when he took office.\n\nHillary has a book to promote, naturally. This time she\u2019s dragging Chelsea along for the ride. The book is titled \u201cThe Book of Gutsy Women\u201d. She says she\u2019s just happy with being a grandma these days but then exposes a little truthfulness. She\u2019s obsessed with thoughts of her failed campaign.\n\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t deny that a big part of me cares deeply about what\u2019s happening in the country, and what I fear is the damage that\u2019s being done: The damage being done to our future, the damage being done to our values, our institutions. So, I think about it a lot, and try to think of ways that I can help those who are on the front lines of the fight.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton should be off the stage, enjoying her life in her golden years. She has all the wealth and resources she needs to do anything she wants. Unfortunately for all of us, she wants to plant herself on a stage with a microphone and feel sorry for herself.", "description": "\"A corrupt human tornado\"", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/HillaryChelsea.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
