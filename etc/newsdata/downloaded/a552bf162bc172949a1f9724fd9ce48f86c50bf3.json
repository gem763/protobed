That\u2019s all S\u00e1nchez could shake his head at as he walked off the field after seven innings, that misplaced slider rattling around his brain, Mitch Garver\u2019s two-run homer soon leading to the Nationals\u2019 5-0 loss to the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday night. Washington\u2019s offense did nothing against Twins starter Jos\u00e9 Berr\u00edos and the bullpen behind him. The Nationals went down in order in all but two innings. They finished with just two hits and, after struggling in Atlanta over the weekend, have a prolonged slump to address. And while S\u00e1nchez kept them in it \u2014 and was nearly unhittable \u2014 he couldn\u2019t take that middle-in slider back.\n\n\u201cI just want to make that pitch in the dirt,\u201d he said. \u201cJust one mistake in the whole night, and I paid for it.\u201d\n\n[Analysis: Nationals lead the NL wild-card race, but the schedule does them no favors]\n\nThe Nationals arrived in Minnesota in full control of their postseason chances. They had a 2\u00bd -game lead over the Chicago Cubs for the National League\u2019s top wild-card spot. They had a 4\u00bd -game lead over the Milwaukee Brewers to play in the wild-card game at all, with or without home-field advantage. But those advantages could only shrink once Adam Eaton struck out to end it. The Brewers, despite losing MVP candidate Christian Yelich to a season-ending knee injury, beat the Miami Marlins to nudge a game closer. The Cubs were just starting a matchup with the Padres in San Diego.\n\nThe Nationals also got here a bit banged up, an issue magnified by how tough of a stretch they\u2019re in. They have lost five of their past six. They just finished four games with the first-place Braves. They have this three-game series against the Twins, who lead the American League Central, before hosting the Braves for three this weekend. Then they fly to St. Louis for three games with the Cardinals. This loss started a run of 20 games in 20 days to finish the regular season. The only break is three games at the Miami Marlins, and that\u2019s on top of the pressure of a pennant race.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like the wild card is the bigger race right now, other than the Central,\u201d catcher Yan Gomes said. \u201cYou\u2019re just trying to play today like it is and move on to tomorrow. You can\u2019t keep turning it on or off when you see other teams struggling. When things like this start happening, you have a target on your back.\u201d\n\n[After four years, Aaron Barrett made it back to an MLB mound. And the tears flowed.]\n\nSo it wasn\u2019t ideal to face the Twins without catcher Kurt Suzuki and lefty Roenis El\u00edas. Suzuki is day-to-day with right elbow inflammation, leaving Gomes to catch as much as possible, and possibly leading Manager Dave Martinez to start Raudy Read or Tres Barrera in the near future. El\u00edas is one of just two left-handed relievers on the active roster, along with Sean Doolittle, leaving Martinez shorthanded against one of baseball\u2019s better lineups.\n\nS\u00e1nchez did his best to limit the bullpen\u2019s workload. He just never got any run support. He was in a groove right away and matched Berr\u00edos for six innings. The Twins right-hander retired the first 13 batters he faced. S\u00e1nchez, throwing to Gomes for the first time this season, faced just one over the minimum through four innings. The only base runner through the fourth, for either team, came in the third when S\u00e1nchez issued a two-out walk to Jonathan Schoop but didn\u2019t let him advance any farther.\n\nBerr\u00edos filled the zone with his low-90s fastball and got nine of his 21 outs on the ground. He gave up the game\u2019s first hit, to Howie Kendrick with one out in the fifth, but he stranded Kendrick at second after allowing him to advance on his own throwing error. He finished with four strikeouts in seven innings, got 20 called strikes on 94 pitches, and when he exited he had allowed just three base runners.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t get very many pitches to hit,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cWhen we did, we did. Just couldn\u2019t get [anything] going.\u201d\n\n[Even during the nonstop MLB season, An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez is with his kids as much as possible]\n\nThe Twins\u2019 first hit came in the bottom half of the fifth, when Willians Astudillo lifted an 0-2 sinker into the right-center field gap. He, too, was left on base as S\u00e1nchez continued to carve through Minnesota\u2019s order. S\u00e1nchez allowed a double to Luis Arraez with one out in the sixth, giving the Twins their first runner in scoring position, but sharp defense helped him short-circuit the rally.\n\nThat kept the scoreboard blank heading into the seventh. Then Eddie Rosario led off the bottom of the inning with a double. Garver\u2019s 30th homer of the season put the Twins ahead for good and left S\u00e1nchez wishing he had buried his slider in the dirt at Garver\u2019s feet.\n\n\u201cOne of the two teams has to win. One of the pitchers has to make a mistake,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said, and his next line punctuated each answer of his postgame interview. \u201cI did, and I paid for it.\u201d\n\nThe 35-year-old whipped around after Garver made contact, just in time to see the ball sail out of the park. Juan Soto chased it in left until he ran out of room.\n\nThe Nationals got to face the Twins\u2019 bullpen for two innings, getting a relief from Berr\u00edos, but the results didn\u2019t change. Minnesota dented Tanner Rainey for three runs in the eighth, raising questions about why Martinez didn\u2019t go with one of his high-leverage relievers, and the last one scored when Javy Guerra yielded a sacrifice fly.\n\nMartinez chose to keep Hunter Strickland, Daniel Hudson and Wander Suero rested for when the Nationals have the lead. But his team never found an answer for a single swing.\n\nGames do have a way of tightening this time of year.", "description": "Washington managed just two hits, and Minnesota grabbed the lead on a two-run homer in the seventh inning on its way to a 5-0 win.", "authors": ["Jesse Dougherty", "Reporter Covering The Washington Nationals.", "September At Pm", "Jesse Dougherty Covers The Washington Nationals."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_h7mNwh32XaWGDshq94GOgfFK5I=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JYQXERGUHAI6TE2DIDNVPT3KXU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
