Tulsi Gabbard at the Presidential Gun Sense Forum in Des Moines, Iowa, August 10, 2019. (Gage Skidmore)\n\nDemocratic Presidential Candidate Tulsi Gabbard (D., Hawaii) announced Thursday that she is \u201cseriously considering\u201d a boycott of the upcoming Democratic debate on Oct. 15, alleging that \u201cthe DNC and corporate media are trying to hijack the entire election process.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are attempting to replace the roles of voters in the early states, using polling and other arbitrary methods which are not transparent or democratic, and holding so-called debates which are not debates at all but rather commercialized reality television meant to entertain, not inform or enlighten,\u201d Gabbard said in the statement.\n\nGabbard\u2019s campaign, which is currently polling at just over half a percentage point, has focused in recent weeks on grassroot efforts in early primary voting states.\n\n\u201cThere are so many of you who I\u2019ve met in Iowa and New Hampshire who have expressed to me how frustrated you are that the DNC and corporate media are essentially trying to usurp your role as voters in choosing who our Democratic nominee will be,\u201d Gabbard says in the announcement, before stating that she will announce her final decision in the coming days.\n\nGabbard qualified for the upcoming debate but missed out on the last one this past month, after reaching the donor threshold but falling two DNC-approved polls short of clearing the public support threshold. Gabbard\u2019s campaign slammed the committee\u2019s decision-making, arguing that the standards were arbitrary and lacked transparency.\n\n\u201cIt creates a lack of faith and trust in the process,\u201d Gabbard told Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson in August. \u201c\u2026 Really what [the voters] see is a small group of really powerful political elites, the establishment making decisions that serve their interests and maintaining that power while the rest of us are left outside. The American people are left behind.\u201d\n\nGabbard was the most-searched candidate after the first and second Democratic debates earlier this year.", "description": "Gabbard\u2019s campaign, currently polling at just over half a percentage point, has focused on grassroot efforts in early primary voting states.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Jim Geraghty", "Victor Davis Hanson", "John Mccormack", "Rich Lowry", "Andrew C.
