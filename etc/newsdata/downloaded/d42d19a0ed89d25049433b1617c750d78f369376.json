It is on track. In terms of the appointment itself, we will make an announcement in due course, ahead of the start of the next Governor's term on 1 February 2020,\" Javid wrote to the committee in a letter released on Tuesday.\n\nThe British parliament's Treasury Committee typically questions senior BoE staff before they take office, and although it lacks a formal veto, it can pressure officials to step down, most recently with BoE chief operating officer Charlotte Hogg.\n\n\"I would like to assure you that the Committee will have the opportunity and time to scrutinize the successful candidate after the appointment has been made but before the individual has taken up the role,\" Javid wrote.", "description": "UK's Javid promises parliament chance to scrutinize next BoE governor", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF970JQ_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
