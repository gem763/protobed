A court in Scotland ruled in the prime minister\u2019s favor in a case that sought to force him to obey a law requiring he request a delay if he can\u2019t reach a deal.\n\nKey Developments:\n\nJohnson\u2019s lead negotiator, David Frost, in Brussels for talks with European CommissionScottish judge rules in Johnson\u2019s favor after pledges over Brexit delayWhen This $2 Trillion Market Turns, Start Worrying About BrexitBrexit Deal Prospects Fade as Talks Stall, EU Signals Pessimism\n\nJohnson Wins Scottish Challenge on Extension (12:55 p.m.)\n\nA Scottish judge refused to put further obligations on Boris Johnson, saying his \u201cunequivocal assurances\u2019\u2019 to seek an extension to the Brexit deadline were sufficient.\n\nAt a hearing in Edinburgh on Friday, Johnson\u2019s lawyers promised he will obey a law that forces him to postpone Brexit. The claimants had argued that Johnson couldn\u2019t be trusted and should be forced to comply with the legislation under threat of a fine or imprisonment.\n\n\u201cI am not persuaded that it is necessary for the court to grant the orders sought or any variant of them,\u201d Judge Peter Cullen said while giving his ruling.\n\nJo Maugham, one of the challengers, said he will appeal the decision.\n\nJohnson May Meet Varadkar As EU Seeks Progress (12:15 p.m.)\n\nBoris Johnson may try to meet with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in the coming days as he seeks to show progress in Brexit talks, according to a U.K. official speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe U.K. accepts both sides need to know where the proposals put forward by Johnson are heading by Friday, the person said. Both Varadkar and French President Emmanuel Macron signaled they want progress by the end of the week.\n\nIf insufficient progress is made, then Johnson\u2019s plan may not even appear on the agenda for the Oct. 17-18 EU Council meeting, the person said.\n\nBrexit Timeline\n\nTime for EU to Compromise, U.K. Says (11:45 a.m.)\n\nBoris Johnson wants the EU to engage fully with his proposals for the Irish border and it\u2019s the bloc\u2019s turn to compromise, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman James Slack told reporters in London.\n\nReiterating that he won\u2019t accept Northern Ireland being in a separate customs territory from the rest of the U.K., Slack said London has made compromises and expects Brussels to follow suit. He doubled-down on the premier\u2019s pledge to leave with or without a deal on Oct. 31.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to talk with the EU at a pace to secure a deal so that we can move on and build a new partnership between the U.K. and the EU, but if this is to be possible, the EU must match the compromises that the U.K. has made,\u201d Slack told reporters. \u201cThe prime minister believes that we have set out a fair and sensible compromise.\u201d\n\nJohnson will call the leaders of Poland, Sweden and Denmark on Monday, Slack said.\n\nEU Demands \u2018Workable Solution\u2019 (11:35 a.m.)\n\nDavid Frost, the U.K.\u2019s chief negotiator, is at the European Commission for Brexit talks today, commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said.\n\nThe negotiations this week are \u201cto give the U.K. the opportunity to present their proposals in more detail and then we\u2019ll take stock,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added that the U.K. has to come up with \u201ca workable solution now and not something based on untried and revocable arrangements.\u201d\n\nScottish Ruling Expected at Noon (Earlier)\n\nThe latest Scottish court ruling related to Brexit is expected at noon Monday. Politicians are seeking a ruling that forces Prime Minister Boris Johnson to obey a law that requires him to seek an extension if he can\u2019t reach a deal with the European Union.\n\nJolyon Maugham, a lawyer backing the case, said there are two elements to the ruling. First, will the court order Johnson to act as the law dictates, which would create the possibility of fines or even a jail term if he fails?\n\nSecond, is sending a letter requesting the extension -- which Johnson\u2019s lawyers have promised to do -- enough to comply with the law. Or could the court look at other actions by Johnson that might be seen as undermining the law?", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Follow\u00a0@Brexit,\u00a0sign up\u00a0to our Brexit Bulletin, and\u00a0tell us your Brexit story.\u00a0Boris Johnson is calling his counterparts in the European Union as he tries to convince the bloc to accept his latest proposals for the Irish border with the clock ticking down to his Oct. 31 deadline for leaving", "authors": ["Jonathan Browning", "Alex Morales", "Jessica Shankleman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FROIykYq4CrU8HXdyiJvPg--~B/aD0xMjYzO3c9MTY4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/de57001a333086e562be8a0d325602f9", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
