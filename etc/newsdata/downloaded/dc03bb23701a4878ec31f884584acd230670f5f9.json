If the game is cancelled, Japan, which leads Scotland by four points in the Pool A standings, will advance to its first quarterfinal and Scotland will miss out.\n\n\u201cWe are in regular dialogue with World Rugby at all levels to work to ensure our fixture against Japan on Sunday can be played as planned. Public safety is the clear priority,\u201d Scottish Rugby said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWith potential impact on our last Pool A fixture, Scottish Rugby fully expects contingency plans to be put in place to enable Scotland to contest for a place in the quarterfinals on the pitch, and will be flexible to accommodate this.\u201d\n\nBut the rules state that if a pool game can\u2019t be played on its scheduled date, it will be cancelled and logged as a draw with two points each to the teams.\n\nWorld Rugby said: \u201cEvery effort is being made to ensure Sunday\u2019s matches will be played as scheduled. A thorough assessment of venues will take place after the typhoon has passed before a final decision is made on Sunday morning.\u201d\n\nScotland is scheduled to move to its Yokohama hotel on Friday.\n\n___\n\n2:35 p.m.\n\nEngland is leaving Tokyo for Miyazaki on the southern island of Kyushu to avoid Typhoon Hagibis.\n\nThe England-France pool match scheduled for Saturday in Yokohama was cancelled by Rugby World Cup organizers because that is when and where the approaching storm, the most powerful this year, is expected to make landfall.\n\nMiyazaki hosted England\u2019s pre-tournament training camp.\n\nIt\u2019s also not far from Oita, where England\u2019s quarterfinal against Wales or Australia is scheduled next week.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have a short camp in Miyazaki and then we\u2019re off to Oita,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe have an exceptional record in two-week preparations.\u201d\n\n___\n\n2 p.m.\n\nNew Zealand coach Steve Hansen said cancelling their pool match with Italy was \u201ca no-brainer.\u201d\n\nThe All Blacks were informed in the morning that it was off, and they still went out and trained.\n\n\u201cWhen you get a typhoon to the level we\u2019re getting, then safety is the paramount thing so it\u2019s a no-brainer,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cThe most important thing that happens now is how we adapt and adjust to it.\u201d\n\nThe cancellation meant the defending champion All Blacks advanced to the quarterfinals next week ahead of Italy. They will know their opponent on Sunday, either Ireland, Japan, or Scotland.\n\nCaptain Kieran Read said they were disappointed for themselves and Italy, and the fans.\n\n\u201cOf course we\u2019d want this game in terms of game-time and things,\u201d Read said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been around this game a long time, trained a lot together and we\u2019re ready to go next week. It\u2019s got no bearing on how we turn up next week and we\u2019re excited by it.\u201d\n\n___\n\n12 p.m.\n\nThe powerful typhoon that has caused the first ever cancellation of Rugby World Cup games has ended Italy\u2019s prospects of reaching the quarterfinals and could upset Scotland\u2019s chances of progressing to the knockout stages as well.\n\nRugby World Cup organizers announced that two games scheduled for Saturday - the Pool C decider between England and France in Yokohama and the Pool B game between defending champion New Zealand and Italy in the city of Toyota - were canceled because of the anticipated impact of Typhoon Hagibis.\n\nSunday\u2019s game in Yokohama between host Japan and Scotland could also be scrapped, depending on the weather.\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency is warning the powerful typhoon may bring torrential rain and strong winds to central parts of the country over Saturday and Sunday, coinciding with the last round of World Cup pool games. It has urged people to take precautions to avoid potentially life-threatening danger. Airlines and train services anticipate cancellations in what is expected to be the most destructive typhoon of 2019.\n\nWorld Rugby tournament director Alan Gilpin said organizers had looked at all options, including moving the Yokohama and Toyota games to other venues, but it wasn\u2019t logistically possible in a fair way to all teams.\n\nAll games canceled because of weather are logged as scoreless draws and each team will get two competition points, meaning Italy cannot finish better than third in Pool B and England will top Pool C without having to play France, despite both teams being unbeaten.\n\nFriday\u2019s Pool D game between Australia and Georgia at Shizuoka and Saturday\u2019s game between Ireland and Samoa at Fukuoka will go ahead as scheduled.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Latest on Day 21 at the typhoon-affected Rugby World Cup (all times local):", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/10/japan_rugby_wcup_typhoon_27394_c0-179-4293-2682_s1770x1032.jpg?c6a39767f1be42bb7bf28d84821eb521f2ae95f5", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
