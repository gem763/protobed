They have not done themselves any favors.\n\nThey have impugned the integrity of witnesses. They have engaged in publicity stunts, like when several dozen House members stormed the secure hearing room where depositions are heard, some of them violating security protocols by bringing cellphones into the facility.\n\nAnd their protests of Democratic \u201csecrecy\u201d rang hollow because Republicans on three committees \u2014 including 13 of the stormers \u2014 have been allowed in to participate.\n\nThe Trump administration, meanwhile, has defied subpoenas and withheld witnesses, while arguing that the House impeachment inquiry isn\u2019t legitimate without a vote to formally launch one.\n\nVote on impeachment resolution\n\nNow they are going to get that vote, something House Speaker Nancy Pelosi should have scheduled weeks ago. Better late than never, we suppose. The resolution coming before the House as early as Thursday would move the impeachment process to open hearings and create ground rules very much like those the Republicans adopted in President Bill Clinton's impeachment hearings in 1998.\n\nWith attacks on the process faltering, Trump suggests he'll begin to mount a more substantive defense of his actions. \u201cI\u2019d rather go into the details of the case rather than process,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cProcess is good. But I think we ought to look at the case.\u201d\n\nYes, we should, Mr. President.\n\nThe details that have come out so far are damning. They confirm virtually every element of the whistleblower complaint that triggered the impeachment inquiry. Witnesses have said that duly appropriated military aid to Ukraine, as well as a personal meeting between Trump and the Ukrainian president, were made contingent on that country launching an investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nThose are very serious accusations that the president abused his power by subordinating national security to his personal political interest in digging up dirt on a potential rival.\n\nWhy was military aid withheld?\n\nA credible defense on the substance would involve providing a legitimate rationale for why the nearly $400 million in security aid was withheld. It would also mean finding credible witnesses to counter the ones who have come forward.\n\nYet no sooner had Trump said it was time to look at the substance of the impeachment inquiry, than he reverted to petty personal attacks.\n\nOPPOSING VIEW:House Democrats are just trying to invalidate the 2016 election of President Trump\n\nHe called one witness, Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a \u201cNever Trumper\u201d \u2014 a term generally applied to Republicans and independent conservatives who oppose him. Unlike previous witnesses, Vindman was cleared and listening in on Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25, and he offered a firsthand account to House investigators Tuesday. In as much as Trump has previously called Never Trumpers \u201chuman scum,\u201d the logical inference is that the president is calling Vindman human scum.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty harsh for someone who has made military service his career, who is a combat veteran of Iraq, who was awarded a Purple Heart after almost being killed by a roadside bomb, and who was chosen for the high honor of serving as a uniformed staff member of the president\u2019s National Security Council.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s enablers have pointed to Vindman\u2019s heritage as a Ukrainian whose family fled to America when he was 3 years old in 1979. Former Rep. Sean Duffy of Wisconsin even suggested that Vindman did not have America\u2019s interest at heart but rather those of Ukraine. That comes close to questioning the patriotism and loyalty of someone who has served the United States of America with extraordinary distinction.\n\nEnough is enough. Stop the character assassinations. Call off the stupid stunts. Face the facts, which provide ample reasons for elevating the impeachment inquiry to the next level.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.", "description": "On the Ukraine call, witnesses confirm virtually every detail of the whistleblower complaint.
