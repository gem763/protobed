What Celtic lacked in guile they made up for with spirit and it delivered three points. Celtic\u2019s position at the top of Group E has been strengthened before an eagerly anticipated trip to Rome early next month.\n\nLazio will be frustrated at not taking a point from a match to which they contributed so heavily. The winner came when Christopher Jullien rose to meet an 89th-minute Ryan Christie corner and planted the ball beyond Thomas Strakosha. In the madness that followed, there was time for a magnificent Fraser Forster save from a Danilo Cataldi volley. After the dust had settled, the Lazio manager, Simone Inzaghi, dubbed Forster\u2019s actions a \u201cmiracle\u201d.\n\nNeil Lennon was equally effusive. \u201cI think Lazio were superb,\u201d the Celtic manager said. \u201cFraser pulled off outstanding saves. It has been an epic night for the players and the club. To go toe to toe with Lazio and come away with three points is a huge shot in the arm for this team.\u201d To his credit Lennon did not claim Celtic played at close to their best.\n\nP\u00e9p\u00e9 double rescues Arsenal after Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es threaten upset Read more\n\nThe match opened at vertiginous pace and barely calmed down thereafter. Neither team could retain possession during the first 20 minutes. Celtic came the closer to an opening goal when Christie\u2019s 25-yard drive clipped the outside of a Lazio post.\n\nThe ragged template was maintained until the interval. Celtic generally lacked the fluency they had shown in swatting aside Cluj. Lazio were reasonably comfortable when defending, while their attacking threat was not particularly evident until the 39th minute. Callum McGregor was the next Celtic player to fire wide from long range, 38 minutes in, with what appeared a clear deflection from a Lazio defender ignored by the referee.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Manuel Lazzari beast Fraser Forster.

Lazio launched a rapid counterattack that culminated in Manuel Lazzari slamming high beyond Forster from an acute angle with a high-quality finish.\n\nLazio were roused by Lazzari\u2019s ferocious intervention. Joaqu\u00edn Correa had an opportunity to double the advantage 10 minutes after the restart but dallied and was dispossessed by Jullien. Correa was wasteful again moments later as he failed to find Felipe Caicedo, who was bearing down on goal.\n\nAnthony Martial on the spot to give Manchester United win in Belgrade Read more\n\nOdsonne \u00c9douard, with his first meaningful act, took advantage of Strakosha\u2019s wandering from the Lazio goal. With the keeper stranded, \u00c9douard backheeled to Christie. The midfielder\u2019s first-time effort was blocked by a defender\u2019s despairing dive. That Lazio had created their own problem rather summed up Celtic\u2019s bluntness in the first hour.\n\nCorrea passed up the chance that would surely have settled the tie in Lazio\u2019s favour. Celtic\u2019s central defence, far from convincing at any stage, allowed the striker to march towards goal as Sergej Milinkovic-Savic found his teammate with a pass. Correa watched his effort beat the advancing Forster but bounce back from a post.\n\nHow Celtic punished Lazio for that generosity. \u00c9douard unselfishly found Christie inside the penalty area and the latter clipped home in the composed fashion that has become typical. Strangely, this equaliser had arrived at a juncture in the game where Celtic had appeared vulnerable.\n\nNeither team were content to settle for parity. Inzaghi demonstrated ambition by introducing the prolific Ciro Immobile 17 minutes from time. Marco Parolo should have edged Lazio back in front but Forster made an excellent save with his feet. Jullien delivered the next, fatal blow to Inzaghi.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we deserved to lose,\u201d Lazio\u2019s manager said. \u201cBut for an incredible stop from the goalkeeper, we wouldn\u2019t have.\u201d", "description": "Celtic beat Lazio 2-1 in the Europa League but had to wait until the 89th minute for Christopher Jullien to score the winner", "authors": ["Ewan Murray"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/634bcf031711d31ea3d866f58fdbd97077825da8/0_84_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5cdc90ef77ec9f2a42ff4b4be18def41", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
