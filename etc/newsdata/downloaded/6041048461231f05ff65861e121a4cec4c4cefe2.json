The force said it was a \"proportionate and reasonable\" move to end a major disruption.\n\nMore than 1,400 people have been arrested since the group began blocking roads, bridges and airports in London a week ago to demand faster action on climate change. Most have been released without charge.\n\nExtinction Rebellion said Tuesday it had \"let the Trafalgar Square site go\" but \"the international rebellion continues.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, a member of the group climbed atop an entrance to the Department for Transport to protest the downing of trees for a high-speed rail project.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
