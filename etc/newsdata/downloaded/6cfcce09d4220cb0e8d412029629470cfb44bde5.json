That sets him apart from many economists and even some private-equity peers.\n\nThe billionaire has a lofty vantage point, as his investment firm has more than half a trillion dollars in assets under management and owns businesses that span real estate, infrastructure, media, technology, and energy.\n\nSchwarzman, 72, visited the New York headquarters of Business Insider earlier this month ahead of the launch of his book \"What It Takes.\"\n\n\"I think we're headed to a slow down. I don't think we're headed particularly to a recession,\" Schwarzman said.\n\nSchwarzman is also a friend and confidant of President Donald Trump and says he has recently found himself sitting at the nexus of trade negotiations with the world's governments, including China and Canada.\n\nSchwarzman attributed his optimism to the well-being of consumers. He said that with minimum wages rising in states across the country, everyday American workers would have more money in their pockets. He also pointed to a general uptick in wage growth.\n\nA July report from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that weekly earnings for full-time workers was 3.7% higher in the second quarter of 2019 than a year earlier. This, he said, was higher than both the economic growth rate of the country (2%) and the rate of inflation (1.7%).\n\nOne of economists' biggest concerns lately has been a slowdown in US manufacturing. The sector contracted in August for the first time in three years, according to a widely tracked index from the Institute for Supply Management.\n\nSchwarzman acknowledged the sector was \"getting really soft\" but said he didn't think that meant there would be a recession.\n\n\"Could be, but unlikely,\" he said.\n\nConsumer spending is a better indicator, he said, given that it accounts for around 70% of the US economy, whereas manufacturing accounts for about 11%. He said he'd rather see strength in industry, but as long as consumer spending isn't affected, he thinks we will \"not go into a recession.\"\n\n\"A little of it is confidence,\" he added. \"If people have the confidence that they're going to stay employed and so forth, then it'll go on.\"\n\nSchwarzman's comments came after a report from the National Association for Business Economics found that 72% of economists surveyed thought a recession would occur before the end of 2021.\n\nSchwarzman's peers have also been in the mix of financial professionals who fear doom and gloom on the horizon. David Rubenstein, the cofounder of The Carlyle Group, another huge private-equity firm, told CBS in August that he was \"somewhat concerned\" about a recession, pointing to the cyclical nature of the economy.\n\n\"We haven't had one for quite a while,\" he said.\n\nRubenstein said that since World War II, recessions have hit on average every seven years.\n\nRead more: Goldman Sachs' push into private equity is ruffling feathers at Blackstone \u2014 and it might be a sign of big client skirmishes to come", "description": "Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman explained to Business Insider why he doesn't think a US recession lies ahead.", "authors": ["Casey Sullivan", "Richard Feloni"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d80ef1c2e22af3aac6e4e2c-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
