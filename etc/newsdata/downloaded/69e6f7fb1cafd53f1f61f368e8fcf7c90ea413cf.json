Today Hulu announced that downloads are now available on Android smartphones and tablets.\n\nDownloads first launched on iOS and iPadOS earlier this month. Only customers who pay for Hulu\u2019s No Ads plan ($11.99 per month) are able to save movies and TV shows to watch later if they\u2019re somewhere without internet connectivity. If you\u2019re on the basic, ad-supported Hulu tier, you can only stream \u2014 not download anything.\n\nHulu allows downloads of up to 25 titles across a maximum of five devices. You have 30 days to hit play on downloaded content, but only two days to finish something that you\u2019ve already started. You can renew expired content once you\u2019re back online (so long as it\u2019s still part of Hulu\u2019s catalog) to preserve the offline download.\n\nThere are two options for download video quality: standard or higher. Standard will download faster and take up less storage on your device, but won\u2019t look quite as good as the higher-quality setting.\n\nHulu recently introduced a like and dislike system that gives subscribers more control over their home feed and recommendations, and Hulu says more improvements to the user experience are on the way.", "description": "After launching the feature on iOS, Hulu has brought offline downloads to Android devices.
