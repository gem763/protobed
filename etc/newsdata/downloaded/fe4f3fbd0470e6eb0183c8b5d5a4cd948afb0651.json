According to Pierce Brosnan, the idea of a female Bond is downright \u201cexhilarating.\u201d Like invisible car hurtling toward an ice palace-levels of exhilarating. \u201cYes!\u2019 Brosnan told The Hollywood Reporter when asked about the potential hiring of a woman for the role. \u201dI think we\u2019ve watched the guys do it for the last 40 years. Get out of the way, guys, and put a woman up there. I think it would be exhilarating. It would be exciting.\u201d\n\nHowever, the actor, who played the British secret agent in 1995\u2019s GoldenEye, 1997\u2019s Tomorrow Never Dies, 1999\u2019s The World Is Not Enough and 2002\u2019s Die Another Day, doubts a lady 007 will grace the silver screen as long as the Bond franchise is executive produced by Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen with the Broccolis,\u201d said Brosnan. \u201cI don\u2019t think that is going to happen under their watch.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, Barbara Broccoli told the Guardian, \u201cBond is male. He\u2019s a male character. He was written as a male and I think he\u2019ll probably stay as a male.\u201d So, if the rumor about actress Lashana Lynch potentially picking up the 007 mantle from Daniel Craig in No Time to Die is true, consider her first mission extremely accomplished.", "description": "Pierce Brosnan, who played James Bond in GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies, The World Is Not Enough and Die Another Day, supports casting a female 007.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/9-Pierce-Brosnan.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
