In today\u2019s edition, it\u2019s all about team-ups: Lizzo and Ariana, Kesha and Big Freedia, Maren Morris and Hozier, Pet Shop Boys and Years & Years, and Dolly Parton and a dancefloor.\n\nGalantis & Dolly Parton \u2014 \u201cFaith (feat. Mr. Probz)\u201d\n\nAlthough the Swedish EDM duo had us at \u201cand Dolly Parton,\u201d this giddy, claptastic track more than delivers the goods as a life-affirming dancefloor jam. That it is built atop the sturdy foundation of the great John Hiatt classic \u201cHave a Little Faith in Me\u201d and the video features a rainbow coalition of bus riders breaking out into impromptu dancing is smiley-face icing on the cake. For impatient listeners, living ray of sunshine Parton bursts in at the 1:40 mark like a shot of pure Vitamin D. \u2014Sarah Rodman\n\nPet Shop Boys \u2014 \u201cDreamland (feat. Years & Years)\u201d\n\nTechnically speaking, \u201cDreamland\u201d came out in early September \u2014 and truth be told, we completely missed it. So today\u2019s drop of singles \u201cAn open mind\u201d and \u201cNo boundaries,\u201d both of which ooze the Pet Shop Boys\u2019 famously ethereal champagne-bubble synth, serves a higher purpose of showing us the light that is this holy union between two LGBT icons: the 40-year-strong trailblazing duo of Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe, and the nascent gay phenom Olly Alexander of Years & Years. Know your history, know your agenda, and now, know your new after-hours anthem. \u2014Marc Snetiker\n\nMaren Morris \u2014 \u201cThe Bones (with Hozier)\u201d\n\nThe spitfire Texan (and one quarter of the Highwomen) recently invited the Irish crooner over to offer an assist on this burbling ballad from her latest album GIRL. They make a commanding pair \u2014 even as they intertwine their voices in the most feathery fashion \u2014 and a convincing case that a strong foundation is the key to a lasting love, even for the most mistake-prone among us: \u201cThe house don\u2019t fall when the bones are good.\u201d \u2014SR\n\nLizzo \u2014 \u201cGood As Hell (feat. Ariana Grande) \u2013 Remix\u201d\n\nThe Year of Lizzo and The Year of Ariana have chugged along spectacularly albeit on different routes through 2019, so it was really just a matter of time before these A-list pop trains intersected. They meet modestly but remarkably on this remix of Lizzo\u2019s \u201cGood as Hell,\u201d which itself isn\u2019t so earth-shattering as the hey-you-know-what revelation that Lizzo and Ari are actually perfect pop complements. Their team-up here offers just enough hope that, should we be so lucky, their next collab might be nothing short of great as hell. \u2014MS\n\nKesha \u2014 \u201cRaising Hell (feat. Big Freedia)\u201d\n\nWith an assist from the dependable, inimitable Big Freedia, Kesha \u2014 the decade\u2019s queen bee of glitter-tears long before Euphoria \u2014 makes a welcome return with a catchy sax- and gospel-fueled video riff on televangelist troublemaking. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna go to heaven without raising hell,\u201d she sings with a certain ebullience, and while the tune does feel like Kesha\u2019s unique take on the motifs that sent Lizzo skyrocketing, there\u2019s room plenty for a plurality of self-love \u2014 and it\u2019s easy to see why Kesha, in her astounding new era, is singing to the rafters on this one. \u2014MS\n\nRelated content:", "description": "EW's Friday Five: Dolly Parton, Lizzo, Ariana Grande, Kesha", "authors": ["Marc Snetiker"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Q8CwzyHXp1eINfvSd.ekCQ--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/entertainment_weekly_785/61f8436e3acef2ac4769f7b638058614", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
