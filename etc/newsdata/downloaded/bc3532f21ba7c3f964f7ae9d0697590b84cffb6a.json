He said he pulled over and fell asleep.\n\nOfficers allowed him to drive home and did not administer a breathalyzer or a field sobriety test. Johnson said officers do such tests only when a motorist appears impaired or officers smell alcohol or cannabis.\n\nHe said the medical episode was the result of not following doctor\u2019s orders.\n\n\u201cWhen he adjusted my medication, I took the old medication for high blood pressure but I failed to put the new medication in,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring a news conference with the then mayor, Rahm Emanuel, in early 2017, Johnson had to be helped to a seat after he appeared to be about to fall.\n\nHe was diagnosed decades ago with a kidney condition, which two years ago led to a transplant with his son as the donor. This year he was hospitalized for a blood clot.\n\nMayor Lightfoot said Johnson told her he had just changed medication, and said she has \u201cno reason to doubt\u201d his account.\n\n\u201cWe know he\u2019s had some medical issues,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s on the other side of a kidney operation, which is obviously very, very serious. There have been some issues with high blood pressure, and so forth.\u201d\n\nShe also said that she knew from dealing with her parents that certain medications have side effects. \u201cSo I take him at his word.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a grown man,\u201d she added. \u201cHe had a couple of drinks with dinner.\u201d", "description": "Eddie Johnson says incident related to medication but mayor\u2019s comments differ from first official explanation", "authors": ["Associated Press In Chicago"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1d02e1cf95d875b1fb9ca39e195f63a67f83da6/0_28_4398_2639/master/4398.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=804b7cc15081b591420decf8d33e43d1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
