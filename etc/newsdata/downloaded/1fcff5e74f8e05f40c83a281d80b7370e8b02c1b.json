Grace Meng is still fighting for more, trying to create a world where menstruation is not stigmatized and period products are not seen as luxury items but necessities that should be accessible and, in many cases, free.\n\n\u201cI think almost everyone can relate or remember a situation where you were in a public space and you got your period and you didn\u2019t know what to do because either you didn\u2019t have money or you or you weren\u2019t near a drugstore,\u201d Meng, a Democrat who represents Queens, New York, told \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u201cThese are not luxury products that we choose to use for ourselves and they should be just as available as toilet paper is and paper towels in a bathroom.\u201d\n\nMeng\u2019s activism on the issue all started with a letter from a high school girl who lived in her congressional district and wrote to her concerned that women in homeless shelters did not have access to tampons and pads.\n\nPHOTO: Congresswoman Grace Meng speaks at a press conference on Capitol Hill in March 2019 to announce the introduction of the Menstrual Equity for All Act. (Office of Congresswoman Grace Meng) More\n\n\u201cWhen I first started studying up on this issue I sort of just assumed, OK, this affects people in underdeveloped countries and how can we help girls who have to skip school,\u201d said Meng. \u201cThen the more I learned about it, I realized that it\u2019s happening to people right here in our country and right here in [New York City].\u201d\n\n\u201cI realized there really was a sort of injustice about how girls and boys are being treated, especially in the lens of menstrual equity and just the basic human right of being able to access these products that affect a majority of our population,\u201d she said.\n\n(MORE: 5 ways women are reclaiming their period products)\n\nWomen make up more than half of the population in the United States, according to the Census Bureau. They are also more likely than men to live in poverty, and they spend an average of 2,535 days in their lifetime, or almost seven years, on their periods, according to UNICEF.\n\nA survey released this year of low-income women in St. Louis, Missouri, found nearly two-thirds couldn\u2019t afford menstrual hygiene products in the past year, and more than one in five said they had the same problem every month. The women said they instead had to use cloth, rags, tissues, toilet paper and sometimes diapers or paper towels, according to the report published in Obstetrics & Gynecology.\n\nIt is those stories that Meng said she hears too often and which motivate her to make menstruation equity a priority in Congress.\n\n\"In this great country, there should not be anyone who is not able to access these products for a human bodily function that they have no control over,\" she said. \"Access to these products should not depend on your income level or your status in life.\"\n\nFrom a high school student's letter to changing federal prisons\n\nMeng, a mother of two sons, learned after receiving the letter from her high-school-age constituent that federal grants provided to homeless shelters in New York City prohibited the shelters from purchasing and distributing menstrual products.\n\nShe wrote a letter to the Obama administration asking for help, and soon after the Federal Emergency Management Association (FEMA) announced it would allow homeless shelters to use federal grant money to buy the products.\n\nUp next, Meng took on the federal prison system after she heard stories of women in prison having to ration out their menstrual supplies with their cellmates or having to use limited funds in their commissary accounts to buy tampons and pads.\n\n(MORE: Meghan Markle gives new voice to issue of menstrual hygiene: Here is why you should care)", "description": "A New York congresswoman known as the \"period lady\u201d for her work on ending period poverty has proven critical in enacting changes so that girls in schools and women in prisons and homeless shelters can have free access to pads and tampons.
