This is the opportunity of a lifetime to put an end to the shambolic mess the Tories have made and return hope to millions. Let\u2019s do this.\u201d\n\nCorbyn gave a televised statement at Labour HQ, with his shadow cabinet applauding behind him. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely looking forward to going to every part of the country with my wonderful shadow cabinet team here and all the fantastic Labour activists to give a message of hope where there isn\u2019t one with this government,\u201d he said.\n\nThe exact date for a general election remains unclear. The government\u2019s bill names 12 December, but the Lib Dems and SNP have objected to that date, and Downing Street said on Tuesday it would be willing to accept 11 as a compromise.\n\nA Downing Street spokesman said the only unacceptable date for the government would be the original Lib Dem-SNP proposal of 9 December.\n\nThis would mean parliament being dissolved on Friday to allow 25 working days between dissolution and polling, he said, making it \u201cvery difficult\u201d for both the election bill and a bill on budgets for the suspended Northern Ireland assembly to be passed and get royal assent.\n\nAlso, 9 December is a Monday, meaning election preparations would take place during the preceding weekend, which would be logistically difficult and costly, he added.\n\nThe spokesman said the government could not accept amendments extending the vote to 16- and 17-year-olds or EU nationals, saying longstanding convention dictates that changes to the franchise only happen after extensive consultation.\n\nAdding younger voters would be \u201cadministratively impossible to deliver in the time available\u201d, he said, warning also that adding EU nationals would bring \u201cadministrative chaos\u201d.\n\nLabour is expected to support efforts to amend the bill to bring forward the date, and also to lower the voting age and allow EU citizens to vote. But Corbyn\u2019s statement suggests the party will still support an election, even if those amendments fall.\n\nA Lib Dem source said the party would be willing to consider the 11 December date. The SNP said no decision had yet been taken.\n\nQ&A When might a 2019 general election take place? Show Hide The law requires there be at least 25 working days (five weeks) between calling an election and polling day. That realistically leaves only three Thursdays when the UK could have an election this year, with 12 December being Boris Johnson's preferred option. However, Monday 9 December has also emerged as a possible alternative. The key dates are: Call an election by 31 October for a 5 December polling date\n\nBy 7 November for an election on 12 December\n\nBy 14 November for an election on 19 December Any later seems unlikely as it will be seen as an unwelcome intrusion into the festive season - and difficult to organise, as many of the venues needed for polling stations will be busy with Christmas and holiday events.\n\n\n\nThe prime minister has been seeking to trigger an early poll since last week, when MPs refused to accept the government\u2019s fast-track timetable for scrutinising his Brexit deal.\n\nOver the weekend, the Lib Dems and the SNP had said they would table a one-line bill seeking to trigger a 9 December election, which would only require a simple majority of MPs to pass.\n\nThey said that date was calculated to prevent Johnson bringing his Brexit deal back to parliament, and to avoid students being disenfranchised, as the Christmas break will not yet have begun at most universities.\n\nUK election date: which party wants what, and why does it matter? Read more\n\nAfter his motion fell on Monday, Johnson said he would table a similar bill himself.\n\n\u201cAcross the country, there is a widespread view that this parliament has run its course, and that is because I simply do not believe that this house is capable of delivering on the priorities of the people, whether that means Brexit or anything else,\u201d he told MPs.\n\nThe leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, then made a verbal commitment in the house not to bring back the withdrawal agreement bill.", "description": "Jeremy Corbyn confirms party will vote for bill seeking December poll", "authors": ["Heather Stewart", "Kate Proctor", "Peter Walker", "Polly Toynbee", "John Crace"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90fd4fc3a89820f9e2da308468a8ca3dfd36815a/0_208_3937_2363/master/3937.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9826afda49e4ab74f98f76e7c12ff0c2", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
