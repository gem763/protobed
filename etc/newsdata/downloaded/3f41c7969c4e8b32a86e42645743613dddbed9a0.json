In a decision with wide-ranging political ramifications, Britain's Supreme Court plans to give its verdict Tuesday on the legality of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's five-week suspension of Parliament.\n\nBritain\u2019s Supreme Court has ruled unanimously that Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend Parliament was illegal and \u201cextreme\u201d in a major setback for his Brexit plans.\n\nThe president of the Supreme Court, Brenda Hale, explained from the bench that the decision to prorogue was in excess of what was needed to prepare for a Queen\u2019s speech, where the Government sets out a new legislative agenda, and unreasonably limited Parliament.\n\nThe pound GBPUSD, +0.3941% , initially shot up to $1.2474 from $1.2432 but has since slipped back because of the uncertainty about the significance of the ruling.\n\nIt is unclear how damaging this ruling will be for Johnson and the Government and its impact on plans to take Britain out of the European Union by Oct. 31, with or without an exit deal.\n\nThe Queen had approved the suspension, also known as the prorogation, on the request of Johnson. This caused parliament to be suspended from Sept. 10 to Oct. 14 due to the time needed to prepare a new legislative agenda.\n\nSee London Markets for more markets coverage\n\nHere\u2019s what analysts are saying:\n\n\u2022 Andy Scott, associate director at JCRA an independent financial risk advisor: \u201cThe market reaction to the Supreme Court ruling was somewhat muted, with Sterling rising less than half of one percentage point against its major counterparts. The limited gains for Sterling reflect that today\u2019s ruling doesn\u2019t change the difficulty in securing a Brexit deal before next month\u2019s EU summit, or the fact that an election looms that could result in a hung parliament. Political uncertainty remains elevated and will keep investors cautious over the direction of Sterling.\n\n\u2022 Paul Dales, Capital Economics, chief UK economist: \u201cHere are three ways in which this could influence Brexit, the economy and the financial markets. First, if Parliament does indeed resume in the next few days, then MPs will have more time to try and tighten up the legislation that would force the Prime Minister to delay Brexit to 31st January. Second, and more importantly, it presumably reduces the ability of the Prime Minister to suspend Parliament again, either before 31st October or ahead of any further Brexit deadline, thereby allowing Parliament more leeway to prevent a no deal. Third, Boris Johnson could resign as Prime Minister which, again, would reduce the chances of a no deal (although he said he wouldn\u2019t).\u201d\n\n\u2022 Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fongern, FX & Macro Strategist at MAF Global Forex: \u201cBoris Johnson is coming under increasing political pressure, and so is his strategy. For the time being, this is good news for the British Pound. A potential no-deal scenario has thus been indirectly torpedoed.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Artur Baluszynski, head of research at boutique wealth management Henderson Rowe: \u201cToday\u2019s events mean that an election is now more likely than ever. With both the Tory and Labour electorate fragmented around the deal and no deal issue, the UK is running the risk of turning into an \u201cItaly like\u201d disaster. This would mean a decade of hung parliaments and squabbling politicians while local budgets and infrastructure slowly decay.\u201d\n\n\u2022 David Cheetham, chief market analyst at broker XTB: \u201cThe pound has moved higher in the initial response with the defeat for the government effectively preventing what would have been the setting of a dangerous precedent. Had the court ruled that the matter was not justiciable, then the PM may well have felt further emboldened to pursue unorthodox tactics to keep no-deal on the table and engage the UK in a game of high-risk brinkmanship. It is now up to the speakers of each of the houses to decide whether parliament should be recalled and given the well known views of Commons speaker John Bercow it looks highly likely that MPs will resume sitting in short order.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index: \u201cThe reason the pound hasn\u2019t rallied higher is quite simply because the level of political uncertainty in the UK remains extremely elevated. This ruling also undermines Johnson\u2019s strategy with EU negotiators. He is suddenly in a considerably weaker position.\u201d", "description": "Here\u2019s what analysts are saying as the U.K. Supreme Court ruled prorogation was unlawful", "authors": ["Rupert Steiner", "Bureau Chief"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR917_uk_sco_ZG_20190924064533.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
