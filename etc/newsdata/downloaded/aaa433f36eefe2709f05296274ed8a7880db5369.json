She has instead championed Sanders\u2019 legislation to replace private insurance by putting every American in an expanded Medicare program.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m with Bernie on Medicare for All,\u201d Warren said recently in New Hampshire when asked if she\u2019d devise a blueprint of her own. \u201cHealth care is a basic human right. We need to make sure that everybody is covered at the lowest possible cost, and draining money out for health insurance companies to make a lot of profits, by saying no.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s deference to a rival is unusual for a candidate who has styled herself as the policy wonk with a program for everything from cradle to grave. It has allowed her to attract many liberal voters who supported Sanders in 2016, leading her to a dead heat with former vice president Joe Biden for the top spot in the Democratic field. And if Sanders were to eventually drop out of the race before Warren, her embrace of his most popular plan could keep his supporters in her camp.\n\nSean McElwee, a left-wing activist and researcher with Data For Progress, said that Warren cannot afford to go soft on Medicare for All.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best option for the campaign to stay in alignment with Sanders on health care through the general election,\u201d he said. \u201cThese Sanders voters have the highest risk of voting third party or staying home, and you have to keep them mobilized.\u201d\n\nWeeks before Warren, a Massachusetts senator, announced that she was exploring a presidential run last December, she sounded less wedded to the Sanders proposal, describing a three-step approach to health care.\n\n\u201cOur first job is to defend the Affordable Care Act. Our second is to improve it and make changes, for example to families\u2019 vulnerability to the impact of high-priced drugs,\u201d she told Bloomberg News. \u201cAnd the third is to find a system of Medicare available to all that will increase the qualify of care while it decreases the cost of all of us.\u201d\n\nAs Warren was rising in the polls, her allies began to pick up signals that Sanders supporters were questioning her commitment to progressive ideas. Since June, Warren has given them little ammunition to claim she\u2019s going soft on Medicare for All, a defining issue for many left-wing voters.\n\n\u201cThe biggest concern Warren has from the left is this idea that, at the end of the day, Sanders is the one true progressive,\u201d McElwee said. \u201cIf your main issue is Medicare for All, and that\u2019s a central tenet of your politics, Warren probably can\u2019t win you. But she doesn\u2019t want you to hate her. She wants to be your fallback option.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Warren faces attacks from Biden for supporting a plan that would replace Obamacare, which Democrats bitterly fought for in 2009 and 2010. \u201cThe senator says she\u2019s for Bernie. Well I\u2019m for Barack,\u201d the former vice president said in the third Democratic debate in September. \u201cI think Obamacare worked.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s plan would build out Obamacare and have a public option for those who want it.\n\nHealth care consistently ranks as the top issue for Democratic voters. Government-run health care is popular among Democrats and Americans overall, but that support dips once voters are given the arguments against it, including that it would require higher middle-class taxes and abolish employer-sponsored coverage.\n\nMedicare for All, which lay at the heart of Sanders\u2019 stronger-than-expected 2016 campaign, has become a litmus test for some progressive activists and voters. To them, it indicates a candidate\u2019s belief in universal health care and willingness to take on private insurers who they say are gouging consumers for profit.\n\nIn Los Angeles on Friday, Warren was asked if her health care vision would raise middle-class taxes. She evaded the question and said working families would see their overall medical costs reduced, referring to the end of premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. \u201cThe very wealthy and big corporations will see their costs go up, but middle-class families will see their costs go down,\u201d she said.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Elizabeth Warren has a plan for everything \u2014 but on the crucial 2020 issue of health care, she\u2019s borrowing from a rival and fellow progressive -- Bernie Sanders.The presidential candidate who made a mark with her signature \u201cI have a plan for that!\u201d is the only one of the five top-polling", "authors": ["Sahil Kapur"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JpRKqoVegVPhhbzFUamKiw--~B/aD0xMjc0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/d9255fde41a62016d5b93c8392943788", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
