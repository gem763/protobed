He needs to act natural,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most important thing is to not show too much the responsibility on your shoulders, to act natural.\n\n\u201cWhen you act natural, if you are a natural leader, you don\u2019t feel the responsibility. When you do what you feel, what you feel here in your heart, it\u2019s natural.\n\n\u201cThe problem is if you need to act. If you are not a real leader and you need to act, you spend energy thinking, \u2018How do I need to face this problem?\u2019\n\n\u201cBut if you trust in yourself and you are a natural leader, then, I promise, you don\u2019t feel the responsibility.\u201d\n\nPochettino knows a lot about leadership, as his own man-management skills have received high praise for the job he has done at Spurs.\n\nHis position has come under question this season, though, due to their terrible start, which hit a nadir in the week before the international break with a 7-2 loss to Bayern Munich followed by a 3-0 humiliation at Brighton.\n\nThe Argentinian has been able to brush that off and described his mood as \u201cflying\u201d, particularly impressing himself with his performance in a training drill.\n\nThe \u2018box\u2019 game is a routine game, where two players in the middle have to try and intercept the passes of everyone else.\n\nPochettino, perhaps unsurprisingly, was the king of the game and avoided the ignominy of a spell in the middle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like I feel now. Of course it\u2019s my responsibility but I am flying,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf you see me today running on the pitch. Today I played boxes. 10, 12 minutes. How many times did I go inside? Toby (Alderweireld), Jan (Vertonghen), Tanguy (Ndombele), Moussa Sissoko, Davinson Sanchez, (Juan) Foyth, Harry Kane, (Harry) Winks, Serge Aurier and Skippy (Oliver Skipp) were the players.
