REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo\n\nThe EU launched its capital markets union (CMU) project in 2014 to encourage more companies to raise funds by issuing stocks and bonds to cut the region\u2019s reliance on bank loans.\n\nIn the EU, companies are still heavy users of banks to get cash unlike in the United States where firms routinely tap the country\u2019s vast capital market to raise money by selling bonds or shares.\n\nProgress towards an EU capital market has been slow but Brexit has created a sense of urgency because London, the region\u2019s biggest capital market, is due to leave the EU next month.\n\nThe group - Markets4Europe - will launch its blueprint to help to deepen the EU capital markets in Brussels on Wednesday, a month before a new European Commission comes into office.\n\nMany of its recommendations try to tackle familiar unresolved issues, but Markets4Europe wants to talk directly to member states, whose support is needed to make progress, rather than call for another \u201ctop down\u201d reboot from Brussels.\n\nThere are also new ideas, such as strengthening the international role of the euro by developing euro-benchmarks for commodity markets.\n\nLondon dominates many of the major commodity benchmarks such as crude oil and gold as well as industrial metals like copper.\n\nMarkets4Europe suggests creating benchmarks for liquid gas, hydrogen and emissions-trading to attract liquidity to those markets and boost the EU\u2019s role in global financial markets.\n\nAnother new idea is to create a so-called \u201csafe asset\u201d in the euro zone.\n\nEuropean Central Bank officials have suggested this could be composed of a pool of sovereign bonds to cut the heavy exposure of banks in the euro zone to their own national debt and help to knit cross-border markets by acting as collateral to back trades.\n\nAfter Brexit, Brussels is keen to reduce Europe\u2019s reliance on London-based financial services through a trade-off between the level of financial market access granted to the UK and extent of EU capital market \u201cautonomy\u201d.\n\nMarkets4Europe also wants more efficient cross-border clearing of securities within the EU. London currently dominates euro-denominated clearing in interest rate swaps.\n\nThe group is backed by Vitor Constancio, former vice president of the European Central Bank, Christian Noyer, former Bank of France governor, Viviane Reding, former vice president of the European Commission, and Germany\u2019s former finance minister Peer Steinbrueck.\n\nAllianz Global Investors (ALVG.DE), Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) Euroclear, Euronext (ENX.PA), BlackRock, SocGen (SOGN.PA), Deutsche Boerse (DB1Gn.DE), Nasdaq Stockholm (NDAQ.O) and UniCredit (CRDI.MI) are among the firms that contributed to the recommendations.\n\nViviane Reding, for example, will focus on national justice ministries to win backing for streamlining taxation and insolvency rules, two sensitive areas where progress has been slow so far, but essential for integrating the legal underpinnings of cross-border markets.", "description": "The European Union could speed up efforts to build an EU-wide capital market by creating euro denominated benchmarks for trading commodities, a new group backed by financial companies, former politicians and central bankers said on Friday.", "authors": ["Huw Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434517343&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0TP", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
