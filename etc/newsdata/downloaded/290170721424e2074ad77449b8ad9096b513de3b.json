I could see the tears rolling down Elly\u2019s face.\n\nMarie added: \u201cWe were told we could lose her if she didn\u2019t have the surgery.\n\n\"After the surgery, we were advised she wouldn\u2019t be able to walk, talk or do anything.\u201d\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo WS)\n\nThe 19-year-old remained on life support and in critical care for 16 hours after undergoing the surgery.\n\nAnd after being moved back to Whiston Hospital where doctors set out to investigate the cause of the stroke Elly was transferred to St Helens Hospital, where she is now recovering.\n\nThe teenager has been undergoing intensive physiotherapy in a bid to learn to walk again and is receiving ongoing support from the Stroke Association\u2019s Stroke Recovery Service in Halton.\n\nMarie added: \u201cElly is now proving the doctors wrong and learning to walk again.\n\n\"Her right arm is starting to get flickers of life.\n\n\"She has pure determination and is pushing herself all the time.\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo WS)\n\n\"Now she says words, not always the right words, but little sentences are coming together. She is also able to come home at weekends.\u201d\n\nThere is no way of knowing if symptoms will pass or get better when they first start, so you need to seek immediate medical help. A stroke is a medical emergency. Always dial 999. The quicker the person arrives at a specialist stroke unit, the quicker they will receive appropriate treatment.\n\nThe event is open to local residents to attend and enjoy a cup of tea and a slice of cake, to raise money for the charity.\n\nThe charity is also encouraging people across the country to host a bake sale of their own from 28 October - 3 November 2019.\n\nTo get involved and sign up for a Give a Hand and Bake fundraising pack click here.", "description": "Elly Milton, from Runcorn, Cheshire, was forced to undergo emergency surgery after she was unable to speak or move", "authors": ["Charlotte Hadfield", "Image", "Liverpool Echo Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20637485.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Elly-Milton.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
