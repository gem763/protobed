If we can't grow food and drink water.'\n\nFellow guest broadcaster Christine Hamilton smirked, to which Mr Stephens said: 'I don't think it's funny Christine.'\n\nFormer Met Police officer Paul Stephens signed up to Extinction Rebellion in April and claims he has been on every demonstration he can since then\n\nPiers argued 'bringing London to its knees' and stopping people going to work or to hospital is 'annoying' and not the right way to fight climate change.\n\nBut Mr Stephens argued: 'Sorry you're put off Piers, but we did the same thing in April and since then we've been in the media every single day. It's worked.'\n\nAsked what he thought of Met Police Comissioner Cressida Dick's view that the protests distract from London's policing needs, he said: 'I don't agree with that. They should step back they should allow us to protest.'\n\nPiers said it was 'good' he had acknowledged he is a 'hypocrite', but continued to grill him.\n\nHe said: 'I'm making changes now. I'm working full time to try to make a change. We all have to make small changes.'\n\nPiers said: 'Why should I give up anything if you, one of the Extinction Rebellion people, aren't prepared to do so?'\n\nMr Stephens replied: 'I'm not that good to adopt a zero carbon lifestyle. I've been weaned on carbon, it's going to take time.'\n\nFellow guest broadcaster Christine Hamilton (far right) smirked, to which Mr Stephens (second right) said: 'I don't think it's funny Christine.'\n\nAfter likening the XR movement to that of the suffragettes, fellow guest Christine Hamilton said it was a 'grotesque' comparison.\n\nHe pointed out he meant the suffragists, the non-violent movement, not the suffragettes.\n\nShe said: 'I never called XR villainous. What I think you are is sanctamonious and self-righteous.\n\n'This Government is at the forefront of taking measures to help climate change.\n\n'We account for two per cent of the world's carbon footprint.\n\n'I think you're behind the curve. You should be working with businesses and government.'\n\nThis morning XR activists blocked the streets around the Bank of England and City of London to protest against a \u00a32.5billion government investment in fossil fuels.", "description": "Former Met Police officer Paul Stephens signed up to Extinction Rebellion in April and claims he has been on every demonstration he can since then.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/10/19683778-0-image-a-32_1571044323510.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
