Research findings have led to calls for the policy to be adopted across the UK.\n\nWales is looking to introduce minimum pricing in 2020, but neither England nor Northern Ireland currently have plans to set a limit.\n\nResearchers, led by a team at Newcastle University, looked at how much alcohol people were buying in shops and supermarkets, but not in pubs.\n\nThey analysed the purchasing habits of 60,000 English and Scottish households between 2015 and 2018. Just over 5,000 of them were in Scotland.\n\nThe English households were used as a control group to measure what would have happened if there had not been a minimum price in Scotland.\n\nWhile households in England increased their consumption slightly, Scottish purchasing fell.\n\nThe study said overall it represented a fall of 7.6%, or 1.2 units, a week per adult on what would have been expected.\n\nThe team said that was about twice the impact predicted ahead of the move.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nReductions were most noticeable for beer, spirits, and cider, including own-brand spirits and high-strength white ciders, and were biggest among the heaviest drinkers.\n\nBut the team acknowledged there needed to be longer-term follow up to see if the drop was sustained, as there was some evidence that in the later months of 2018 consumption had begun to rise again.\n\nLead researcher Prof Peter Anderson said: \"You would expect some levelling off from the initial impact, but I think the findings are enough to suggest minimum pricing is effective and should be adopted across the UK.\"\n\nEric Carlin from the Royal College of Physicians agreed the evidence was compelling, but he said risky alcohol consumption was a \"complex\" public health issue.\n\n\"No single policy lever should be seen as a panacea,\" he added.\n\nScottish public health minister Joe Fitzpatrick said the findings were \"very encouraging\".", "description": "Research shows the amount of alcohol bought by Scots falls 7.6% after new drink laws are introduced.", "authors": ["Nick Triggle", "Health Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A715/production/_107437724_alcoholpricingpa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
