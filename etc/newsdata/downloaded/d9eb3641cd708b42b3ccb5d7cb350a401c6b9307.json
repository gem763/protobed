And we get to eat our way around Melbourne,\u201d she said.\n\nTamara said they were enjoying the \u201cnomadic\u201d lifestyle, and were lucky to have their parents\u2019 houses on standby as places to crash if sitting jobs fell through.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very competitive,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cInitially it\u2019s really hard to get places, but it\u2019s gotten easier (as) homeowners review us.\u201d\n\nThe pair said keeping an up-to-date online presence was crucial, as they were contacted by homeowners for most of their sitting jobs, not the other way around.\n\n\u201cPeople find us \u2014 we went through a phase where we were trying to message people, but people who sign up to these websites get 30 messages a day from people wanting to house sit,\u201d Jess said.\n\nWhen it came to meeting homeowners, Tamara said it was important to treat it \u201clike a job interview\u201d.\n\nDuring the sit, they tried not leave the home vacant for more than four or five hours and always left the house in the same condition as they found it.\n\nMindahome co-founder Sue Coombs said there was plenty of demand for house sitters \u2014 especially in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland \u2014 with 500-900 Aussie homes seeking sitters were listed on the site each day.\n\nThis peaked at 1500 during holidays.\n\nMs Coombs said the vast majority of the jobs involved pet sitting, with homeowners also often wanting their mail collected, their garden cared for and the added security of having someone at their residence.\n\nShe said 40 per cent of Mindahome\u2019s sitters were saving for house deposits. Other common candidates were retirees looking for \u201ccheap holidays\u201d and people \u201croad testing\u201d suburbs they were interested in moving to.\n\nMORE: Box Hill Motel sells nearly $2 million above price expectations\n\nKaleidoscopic Elsternwick pad has allsorts of character\n\nOlympic equestrian saddles up to sell property graced by royalty\n\nsamantha.landy@news.com.au\n\nTIPS FOR FULL-TIME HOUSE SITTERS\n\n-Ask questions: make sure you know what\u2019s expected of you, and that you have all the information you need to complete and enjoy the sit\n\n-Be professional: treat every position you apply for like a job application\n\n-Travel light: it\u2019s much easier if you\u2019re going from place to place, and most facilities are provided at the homes.\n\n-Have a \u2018Plan B\u2019: a place you can stay should there be a gap between sitting jobs\n\n-Provide references or testimonials from past house sitting jobs, and a police check\n\n-Create a good online profile: detail why an owner would want to hire you and include a photo of yourself\n\n-Be flexible with your dates\n\n-Be willing to perform specific tasks requested by the owner, such as gardening, collecting the mail etc\n\nSource: Mindahome\u2019s Sue Coombs", "description": "Full-time house sitters Tamara and Jess have lived in almost a dozen homes in nine months \u2014 and saved tens of thousands of dollars.
