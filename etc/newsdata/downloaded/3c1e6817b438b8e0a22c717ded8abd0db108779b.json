Luria and Spanberger of Virginia join calls for Trump\u2019s impeachment", "language": "en", "text": "From left, Democratic Reps. Jennifer Wexton, Abigail Spanberger and Elaine Luria of Virginia. Spanberger and Luria have joined Wexton, and other Democratic members of the Virginia congressional delegation, in calling for the impeachment of President Trump. (Cal Cary, Ryan M. Kelly and Vicki Cronis-Nohe/Cal Cary, Ryan M. Kelly and Vicki Cronis-Nohe for The Washington Post)\n\nDemocratic Reps. Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger, both from Virginia, say Congress should impeach President Trump if allegations he pressured a foreign leader to investigate a political opponent are true.\n\nThey joined five fellow freshmen lawmakers with backgrounds in national security to announce their position in an op-ed in The Washington Post late Monday.\n\nThey urged their colleagues in Congress \u201cto consider the use of all congressional authorities available to us,\u201d including impeachment hearings, to investigate the allegations against Trump.\n\n[Pelosi quietly sounding out House Democrats about whether to impeach Trump, officials say]\n\nTrump is alleged to have used his position to ask the Ukrainian president to investigate a political rival, while withholding U.S. funding as leverage. His administration also prevented Congress from being informed about a whistleblower claim.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump confirmed that he withheld military money from Ukraine, but said he did so over concerns that European allies were not.\n\nLuria, who represents a military-heavy distinct in Virginia Beach, also put out a statement calling for impeachment with no caveats.\n\nShe said the president\u2019s actions show \u201ca total disregard for our democratic political process.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is clear to me that he has betrayed the public trust and abandoned his obligations to the Constitution by elevating his own interests over the national interest,\u201d she said. \u201cAllegations of this gross misconduct meet the threshold of high crimes and misdemeanors set by the Constitution. Congress must investigate and use the full extent of its powers to check these alleged abuses of presidential power. The House must move forward with impeachment.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to her suburban Richmond constituents, Spanberger said the revelations \u201chave started a new chapter, and they must be treated as such.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to make clear to the people of Central Virginia that these allegations, if proved true, pose a threat to our national security, endanger the integrity of our elections, and represent impeachable offenses. Congress must urgently determine if these allegations are true,\u201d she said.\n\nSpanberger is a former CIA officer and Luria is a former Navy commander who served for 20 years. Both won districts that voted for Trump.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee accused Luria and Spanberger of caving to the far-left of their party in supporting impeachment, despite claims they are moderates.\n\n\u201cIn districts President Trump won, Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger have dropped their phony moderate act to join their impeachment-obsessed base and it will cost them their seats in 2020,\u201d NRCC spokeswoman Camille Gallo said.\n\nThe Virginia members join a majority of House Democrats in calls to impeach, including most Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee, which is where impeachment proceedings would start.\n\nLuria does not yet have a Republican challenger, although that is expected to change after the November legislative races.\n\nTina Ramirez, who leads a nonprofit organization devoted to religious liberty, is the only Republican so far raising money to run against Spanberger.\n\n[Why Rep. Abigail Spanberger is all in on gun control]\n\nIndependent analysts at Cook Political Report consider the races to be toss-ups, while forecasters at Inside Elections and the University of Virginia Center for Politics say the districts lean or tilt Democratic.\n\nRachel Bitecofer, a political scientist at Christopher Newport University, said favoring impeachment could help Luria\u2019s and Spanberger\u2019s reelection efforts.\n\n\u201cThis particular incident is just such a clear-cut violation of the oath of office,\u201d she said. \u201cIt becomes an untenable position for some who purports to be a national security candidate to ignore flagrant abuses of power.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, she predicted Luria\u2019s and Spanberger\u2019s districts would flip blue, based on a surge in turnout by millennials and college-educated suburban women motivated to vote against Trump.\n\nAmong Virginia Democrats in the House, Reps. Gerald E. Connolly, Don Beyer and Jennifer Wexton previously called for impeachment; Reps. Robert C. \u201cBobby\u201d Scott and A. Donald McEachin have said investigations should continue.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The freshman members of Congress represent swing districts that voted for President Trump in 2016.", "authors": ["Jenna Portnoy", "Reporter Covering Virginia", "Maryland", "D.C.
