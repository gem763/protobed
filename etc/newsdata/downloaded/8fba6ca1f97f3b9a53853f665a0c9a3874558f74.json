While I will continue to run the Charlotte Hornets, make all decisions related to the team and organization, and remain the team's NBA Governor, Gabe and Dan's investment in the franchise is invaluable, as we continue to modernize, add new technology and strive to compete with the best in the NBA. Both Gabe and Dan are industry standard-setters and proven leaders, with a belief in philanthropy and a passion for the game of basketball. They share my commitment to Charlotte and the Carolinas, and I look forward to working with and learning from them.\"\n\nPlotkin and Sundheim will not officially be Hornets co-owners until they are approved by the NBA. The process has already begun, though, and the deal is expected to be finalized \"in the next couple of weeks,\" according to Bonnell. It's not known how much of the Hornets Plotkin and Sundheim will acquire.\n\nBonnell noted Jordan owns approximately 97 percent of the team.\n\nJordan, whom Forbes values at $1.9 billion, bought the Charlotte franchise\u2014then the Bobcats\u2014back in 2010 for $275 million. Earlier this year, Forbes valued the Hornets at approximately $1.3 billion, which was tied for the third-lowest valuation in the league.\n\nWhen the North Carolina Tar Heels legend bought the team back in 2010, the six-time NBA champion made it known that he was looking to build a \"winning team\" in Charlotte:\n\n\"Purchasing the Bobcats is the culmination of my post-playing career goal of becoming the majority owner of an NBA franchise. I am especially pleased to have the opportunity to build a winning team in my home state of North Carolina.\n\n\"I plan to make this franchise an organization that Charlotte can be proud of, and I am committed to doing all that I can to achieve this goal.\"\n\nThe Hornets have made the playoffs just twice in Jordan's nine full seasons with the team, with their last postseason appearance coming back in 2016. They have not won a playoff series under Jordan.\n\nAccording to Bonnell, Jordan was interested in bringing on investors with \"deep resources\" who can help the Hornets with modern technology.\n\nA source told Bonnell that Jordan intends to run the Hornets for \"a good, long time.\"", "description": "Michael Jordan  has reached an agreement to sell a \"large piece\" of his  Charlotte Hornets  stake to two investors based in New York, though he will continue to possess majority control ...", "authors": ["Kyle Newport"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/828/162/hi-res-69501c11095f3549b6f84e188f7cac62_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
