It\u2019s far from the scariest splatterfest you\u2019ll see this year, but it\u2019s undoubtedly the most entertaining.\n\nA hit in its native Japan, where it went from playing in a single theater to becoming a cult sensation (with global grosses now in the $30 million range), Shin'ichir\u00f4 Ueda\u2019s feature debut\u2014a horror riff akin to Noises Off or The Play That Goes Wrong\u2014is an ideal fit for midnight screenings, although seeing it in the wee hours of the morning is hardly a prerequisite for enjoying its meta thrills. All that One Cut of the Dead (opening in New York and Los Angeles Sept. 13, and nationwide Sept. 17) demands is a love of genre craziness and, more importantly, a respect for the multifaceted cinematic process, which here is lovingly celebrated via a story that begins in loopy fashion, and then continually ups the self-conscious ante.\n\nUeda\u2019s film opens on the sight of young heroine Chinatsu (Yuzuki Akiyama) wielding an axe to fend off the arms-outstretched advances of Ko (Kazuaki Nagaya), who\u2019s now undead. Her screaming pleas are to no avail, however, as Ko bites down on her neck, thus sealing her fate\u2014and also, abruptly, ending the scene, as director Higurashi (Takayuki Hamatsu), the man behind this production, enters the frame to lambaste Chinatsu for her performance\u2019s lack of conviction. \u201cGive me real fear! The true shiver in your face!\u201d he rails at her, prompting Ko to console her and, as they move to an upstairs level of the abandoned water filtration plant that serves as their set, ask her if she wants to share a hot bath once their day is done, to which she shushes him in an effort to keep their affair secret.\n\nKo and Chinatsu are subsequently joined by makeup woman Nao (Harumi Shuhama), who explains that Higurashi chose this location in part because it\u2019s haunted; rumors abound that the Japanese Army once used it for \u201chuman experimentation.\u201d This freaks the actors out, as does a strange noise at their door. After Nao demonstrates some handy self-defense techniques to Ko, their concerns are confirmed when another member of the crew is attacked by an actual zombie, and the victim\u2019s hand is casually tossed at their feet. What was fake a second ago is now all too real, much to their panicked dismay.\n\nOne Cut of the Dead depicts this earlygoing, and in fact the trio\u2019s entire ordeal, in a single 37-minute handheld take that\u2019s a model of on-the-fly creativity. Whip-panning about with a jazzy energy that\u2019s in tune with its harried protagonists, Tsuyoshi Sone\u2019s cinematography places us right in the middle of the life-imitating-art action. The mayhem seems to have been caused by Higurashi performing a blood ritual on the building\u2019s roof, and it only becomes crazier as more zombies materialize and Chinatsu, Ko and Nao are forced to take up arms\u2014or, rather, axes\u2014against the invading horde. Given that Ueda\u2019s saga has already exposed itself as a movie about a movie, however, it\u2019s hard to ignore the fact that there\u2019s still a camera capturing the threesome\u2019s torment in an unbroken v\u00e9rit\u00e9-style shot, thereby raising the question: who\u2019s filming this?\n\n(Spoilers invariably follow)\n\nSuffice it to say, One Cut of the Dead has another trick up its crimson-stained sleeve, and it\u2019s revealed approximately one-third of the way through its 96-minute runtime, once Chinatsu triumphs over her adversaries and the camera rises to the sky to gaze down on her, and the screen fades first to white, and then to a skyline emblazoned with the title card \u201cOne Month Ago.\u201d That\u2019s when we meet the real Higurashi, a working filmmaker\u2014with a retired-actress wife (Harumi Shuhama, aka the woman who played Nao) and an aspiring-director daughter (Mao)\u2014who\u2019s hired by two producers to helm a live TV broadcast about a zombie-movie production that\u2019s overrun by genuine zombies. In other words, the very show we\u2019ve just witnessed.\n\nThis folding-in-on-itself stunt would be amusing enough on its own, but Ueda is interested in more than mere trickery. Over the ensuing hour, his One Cut of the Dead details the practical work that goes into putting on such a program, including casting, rehearsing, and blocking and choreography. For Higurashi, that means dealing with actors who are divas, drunkards, and pretentious blowhards, never funnier than when Nagaya\u2019s heartthrob-lead comments that the braindead script deals with \u201cthe topic of racism discreetly.\u201d Even getting through a table read of the screenplay proves a chore, thanks to one actress bringing her wailing baby to work.\n\nOn the day of the shoot, legitimate trouble arises when two of the actors are in an accident that prevents them from reaching the set. Since it\u2019s being televised live, though, the show must go on, with director Higurashi taking on the role of the director and his wife assuming the part of Nao. One Cut of the Dead keeps piling on wink-wink layers, depicting the zombie-attack TV show from a detached behind-the-scenes perspective. In doing so, it delivers punchlines to random moments viewers didn\u2019t even know were jokes the first time around\u2014for example, disclosing the logistical-headache reasons certain peculiar on-screen events took place (say, a production assistant suddenly fleeing outside into obvious danger). And that, in turn, underlines the DIY imagination required to pull off such an endeavor.\n\nIt\u2019s that latter vein which transforms One Cut from the Dead from merely a clever cinematic Russian nesting doll into a loving tribute to indie filmmaking and the families it creates (and brings together). Practical inventiveness is the solution to the on-the-ground problems faced by Higurashi and company, as is a willingness to band together to do whatever\u2019s necessary to get the job done. Filled with decapitated dummies, blood-spraying hoses, makeshift title cards and phony weapons, Ueda\u2019s gem is a comedy of errors about the egos, mishaps and mistakes that invariably thwart a production\u2019s completion\u2014and, in its final moments and sterling credit sequence, the resourcefulness that allows artists to reach the heights to which they aspire.", "description": "The low-budget Japanese horror film \u201cOne Cut of the Dead\u201d is a DIY masterpiece, and perhaps the most engaging zombie flick since \u201cTrain to Busan.\u201d", "authors": ["Nick Schager"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568413947/16665120.jpg-r_1280_720-f_jpg-q_x-xxyxx_v96z5z", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
