(AP) - Eyeing a playoff spot and a shot at the national championship, No. 4 Ohio State sure is locked in at the moment.\n\nJustin Fields threw for four touchdowns, J.K. Dobbins rushed for 121 yards and the Buckeyes pounded Northwestern 52-3 on Friday night.\n\nOhio State (7-0, 4-0 Big Ten) did exactly as expected and blew the game open early, jumping to a 31-3 halftime lead.\n\n\u201cI just feel like it\u2019s business,\u201d defensive end Chase Young said. \u201cThat\u2019s the mentality I have, just because I know we can\u2019t have any fluke losses. It\u2019s gonna mess with what we want to do.\u201d\n\nFields completed 18 of 23 passes for 194 yards. The sophomore transfer from Georgia matched his career high for TDs through the air. He now has 22 passing and 30 overall on the season.\n\nThe nation\u2019s second-leading rusher, Dobbins scored from the 5 in the second quarter after breaking off a 67-yard run. He also caught a 19-yard touchdown pass in the first half.\n\nThe junior now has 947 yards rushing after finishing with more than 1,000 in each of his first two seasons.\n\nChris Olave caught two TDs. Blake Haubeil kicked a 55-yard field goal that tied the second-longest in the history of the storied program. The Buckeyes racked up 480 yards while holding the Northwestern to 199 and remained unbeaten heading into their showdown at home with No. 6 Wisconsin next week.\n\n\u201cI think we feel good about the way we came out coming off the bye week - with energy, starting fresh and just refocused on all the things that matter within the program,\u201d coach Ryan Day said. \u201cNow we know we have a huge challenge next week. \u2026 We know what we have in store there, so it\u2019s gonna be a really tough week, tough preparation, tough game, but I know the kids are gonna be excited to play it.\u201d\n\nThe loss was the fourth in a row for Northwestern (1-5, 0-4). The Wildcats haven\u2019t beaten a top-five opponent since the 1959 team opened with victories over No. 2 Oklahoma and No. 5 Iowa.\n\nAidan Smith, making his second straight start, was 6 of 20 for 42 yards and an interception. Smith and Hunter Johnson, who started the first four games before sitting out the loss at Nebraska two weeks ago because of a lower-body injury, were listed with the first team on the depth chart this week.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re continually beating ourselves (on offense),\u201d coach Pat Fitzgerald said. \u201cWe have guys that are pressing, trying to do too much. They care so much. They\u2019re a great group of guys and that\u2019s why my heart breaks for them.\u201d\n\nBREAKING IT OPEN\n\nThrough the first six games, Ohio State outscored opponents 296-53 - an average margin of 40.5 points that was the biggest differential among FBS schools. The Buckeyes came in leading the Big Ten in scoring and were tops in the conference in total yards and yards per game by wide margins.\n\nWith a defense that ranked second in the nation and conference to Wisconsin going against one of the country\u2019s worst offenses, the Buckeyes made it look easy.\n\nOhio State went 70 yards on the game\u2019s opening possession, with Fields hitting a wide-open Olave down the middle for a 20-yard touchdown .\n\nNorthwestern\u2019s Charlie Kuhbander kicked a 33-yard field goal with just over three minutes left in the first quarter. Fields made it 14-3 early in the second when he hit Dobbins on a slant. And after the Wildcats punted, the Buckeyes needed just two plays to bump the lead to 18, with Dobbins carrying the load.\n\nOhio State added 10 more points in the closing minutes of the half to break it open.\n\nBIG BOOT\n\nHaubeil was \u201cvery confident\u201d he would make his 55-yarder to end the half. It was the longest by a Buckeye since Mike Nugent nailed one of his own against Wisconsin in 2004. Tom Skladany holds the record with a 59-yarder at Illinois in 1975.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awesome, definitely proves to yourself and our team as a unit you can execute at a high level from the long-distance range,\u201d Haubeil said.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nOhio State: Consider this a good tuneup for the big showdown next week for the Buckeyes, who will get an extra day of rest.\n\nNorthwestern: Whether it\u2019s Smith or Johnson starting at quarterback, the Wildcats continue to stall on offense. Fitzgerald wouldn\u2019t say who will start at QB next week.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nOhio State: The Buckeyes face a huge test when they host Heisman Trophy hopeful Jonathan Taylor and Wisconsin on Oct. 26.\n\nNorthwestern: The Wildcats will try to stop the slide when Iowa visits on Oct. 26.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Eyeing a playoff spot and a shot at the national championship, No. 4 Ohio State sure is locked in at the moment.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Andrew Seligman"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/19/ohio_st_northwestern_football_44103_c0-137-3300-2062_s1200x700.jpg?b8d17fcc5445bc61e64899c581368704c503e168", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
