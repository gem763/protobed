TMZ reports West owns 4,500 acres, while the remainder is leased from the federal government.\n\nEarlier this week, a video of West, Matthew George -- a Canadian designer and YEEZY clothing line consultant, and Greg Lewis, a songwriter who runs Honest Management, was posted on Twitter showing the three riding an ATV through the site.\n\nWest is currently residing at the ranch, where he is working on a new album said to have heavy religious themes; it's set for a Sept. 27 release.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe outlet reports that West\u2019s longtime collaborator, Pusha T, is also at the estate at the moment, likely to help the 42-year-old finish the project.\n\nWest worked on the album \u201cYe\u201d with Pusha T in Wyoming last year, paying more than $5,000 a night to rent a home in the area.\n\nNot bad for a guy who just three years ago revealed he was $53 million in debt while asking Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for a $1 billion investment. West has since turned his fortunes around, with Forbes ranking the rapper as the third highest-paid celebrity in July, noting he built a $1 billion empire through his brand Yeezy.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The Grammy-winning rapper purchased a Wyoming ranch along a sprawling 4,500 acres, complete with a restaurant and event center on the property.", "authors": ["Matthew Mcnulty"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/07/0/0/kanye-west-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
