The Wallabies have a magnificent World Cup record and have shown time and again they are capable of living with the best teams in the world. Wales have beaten them only once in the tournament\u2019s history and that was back in 1987 when hydration involved drinking eight pints the night before a game and conditioning was something you turned on in your hotel room.\n\nOutside World Cups their record is hardly any better. Wales\u2019 victory in Cardiff last November \u2013 a drab, try-less 9-6 affair \u2013 ended a 13-match losing run against the Wallabies. But, crucially, it gave belief they could earn another win when it really mattered. On Sunday, in Tokyo, it really matters.\n\nWin and Wales can look ahead to a probable quarter-final showdown with France or Argentina, lose and it will more likely be Eddie Jones\u2019s England in the last eight before a possible semi-final against the holders and favourites, New Zealand. Suddenly, the World Cup final would look a very long way off indeed.\n\nIn Alun Wyn Jones Wales have a man for all seasons who knows what it takes to beat Australia, be it with Wales or the British and Irish Lions. While last November\u2019s win in Cardiff was a defence dominated affair, Jones will know his side must surely score tries on Sunday if they are to stand a chance of finishing the day on top of Pool D.\n\nJones, now arguably Wales greatest ever forward, makes his 139th international appearance on Sunday. He hasn\u2019t played in many more important games.\n\nIn George North, Josh Adams and Liam Williams, Wales possess a back three as potent on paper as any but the team\u2019s collective challenge is to find their wide men the time and space required to damage opponents.\n\nInside centre Hadleigh Parkes goes into the game under an injury cloud while Dan Biggar at fly half is not renowned for his willingness to put width on the ball but Wales\u2019 two principle play-makers must find a way to unlock Australia\u2019s defence if Gatland\u2019s men are to deliver on their favourites tag.\n\nAerially they will fancy themselves.\n\nIsrael Folau\u2019s enforced absence \u2013 just one of several controversies surrounding Australia in the lead up to and during this tournament \u2013 has robbed the Wallabies not only of their most attacking threat but also their best defender in the skies.\n\nOnly Liam Williams can match Folau\u2019s brilliance under the high ball and Australia were badly left exposed against Fiji. Full back Kurtley Beale has paid the price, replaced by Dane Haylett-Petty in the No 15 shirt, while Bernard Foley and Will Genia start at half back and Adam Ashley-Cooper replaces Reece Hodge on the wing.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding Hodge\u2019s three-match ban for the concussion-inducing high hit on Peceli Yato have been poured over in great detail after the event. Some uneducated commentators, including Cheika himself, have argued the ban was harsh and unfair.\n\nIf only the same level of interest had been paid to World Rugby\u2019s widely-trumpeted new tackle directives before the tournament then Hodge would not have been forced to admit he had \u201cno knowledge\u201d of them when it came to explaining his actions at the hearing.\n\nAs admissions of erroneous and slapdash preparation go, that line took some beating. If it was true, Cheika and his coaching team badly let down their players in the build up to the competition.\n\nBut despite the relative chaos and confusion around them, Australia will still be a threat. They are too proud a sporting nation not to be when it comes to rugby\u2019s biggest stage.\n\nBut Wales won\u2019t get a better chance of beating them. If they are to have serious pretensions of winning the tournament they surely must.\n\nIt feels like it\u2019s now or never for Wales.", "description": "It\u00a0feels like it\u2019s now or never for Wales.
