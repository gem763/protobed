Lahren\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Brandon Fricke, for example, is running as an independent against Trump-needling Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA), in a district the Cook Political Report rates as solidly Democratic. Meanwhile, Loomer is running against Rep. Lois Frankel (D-FL), who didn\u2019t even face a Republican opponent in 2018 and handily won her 2016 campaign.\n\nBut while the media personality candidates seem destined to lose at the ballot box, they can still win by using the bids to win fame on the right. Tesoriero\u2019s ex-boyfriend, California politician Omar Navarro, pioneered leveraging unlikely campaigns into conservative media stardom. He lost his last two quixotic runs against Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) by more than 50 points, but conservative donors continue to fund his doomed campaigns in an effort to oust Waters, a frequent Trump foil. As Waters\u2019 reputation as a Trump nemesis grew after Trump won the White House, Navarro\u2019s campaign coffers boomed along with it.\n\nThe conservative personalities\u2019 campaigns often echo right-wing media talking points. Loomer has spent much of her campaign so far lambasting Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), even though Omar isn\u2019t her opponent and is running for reelection halfway across the country. Fricke\u2019s campaign launch video, meanwhile, features shots of him looking sternly at homeless encampments\u2014an increasingly popular topic on Fox News and other conservative media outlets.\n\n\u201cWe must not only show compassion for the disadvantaged, but for the hardworking constituents who abide by the laws,\u201d Fricke says in the video, over shots of people who appear to be homeless.\n\nBut while the pro-Trump media personalities can draw on their built-in fanbases for donations and internet attention, they\u2019ve also created a lengthy record for opponents to draw on. Loomer\u2019s campaign, for example, has been hurt by the fact that she\u2019s banned from all major social media platforms, including Facebook and Twitter.\n\nSaladino has a rich store of prank footage awaiting future oppo researchers, should he make it to the general election. In 2016, Saladino, who\u2019s running in the GOP primary to take on Rep. Max Rose (D-NY), was caught faking a racist prank in which a group of African-American men destroyed a car with a Trump bumper sticker. While Saladino\u2019s video claimed that the incident really happened, an onlooker took pictures of Saladino coordinating the prank with the vandals ahead of time.\n\nUnlike many of his compatriots, Saladino is running in a battleground district. But should he beat his more established GOP primary rivals, he\u2019ll have to contend with both his racist prank history and a picture of him, taken while he was making a prank video, wearing a swastika armband.\n\nTesoriero has her own online record to deal with. She\u2019s frequently tweeted her support for QAnon, a conspiracy theory based on anonymous internet clues from a poster called \u201cQ,\u201d which posits that top Democrats are involved in pedophilic cannibal rings and will soon face military tribunals at Guantanamo Bay. If Tesoriero does believe in QAnon, she\u2019d be the third Republican House candidate this cycle to endorse the conspiracy theory.\n\nIn June 2018, for example, Tesoriero tweeted \u201cQ is real,\u201d adding later, \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to see him be proved right.\u201d But in an interview on Sunday, Tesoriero claimed she isn\u2019t a QAnon believer.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that I believed in him or the group or anything, but I do believe in some of the issues that he discusses,\u201d Tesoriero said.\n\nTesoriero has also tweeted her support for the baseless Pizzagate conspiracy theory, which holds that top Democrats sexually abuse children in a Washington pizzeria. In 2016, the conspiracy theory inspired a North Carolina man to drive to the restaurant and fire a gun.\n\nOn Sunday, Tesoriero hedged on whether she believes in Pizzagate.\n\n\u201cDo I believe in Pizzagate?\u201d Tesoriero said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to think about how to answer that.\u201d\n\nCandidates from the right-wing media typically choose prominent incumbent Democrats as their opponents. But D\u2019Abrosca is running a primary challenge against Republican Rep. David Rouzer (NC), who he claims is soft on immigration. D\u2019Abrosca has built his campaign around far-right policy ideas, including a proposed 10-year moratorium on legal immigration.\n\nRouzer\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nComing from the pro-Trump media doesn\u2019t necessarily guarantee coverage from ideological allies, at least for D\u2019Abrosca. In an email to The Daily Beast, D\u2019Abrosca complained that conservative outlets like The Daily Caller and the Washington Examiner, which he claimed are allied with the \u201copen borders-loving GOP establishment,\u201d have ignored his candidacy.\n\n\u201cThe far-left Daily Beast is the first national news outlet to request an interview about my campaign,\u201d D\u2019Abrosca wrote in an email.\n\nWhile the various right-wing media personalities\u2019 efforts seem destined to flop, Tesoriero insisted that she thinks she can beat Pelosi, who won her 2018 reelection campaign by more than 70 points.\n\n\u201cI do think that I stand a chance,\u201d Tesoriero said.", "description": "MAGA media characters like prankster Joey \u201cSalads\u201d Saladino are trying to make it to Congress\u2014and increase their social media following along the way.", "authors": ["Will Sommer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568607631/190915-sommer-pro-trump-tease_ulmfqj", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
