D.C. police found Mr. Plotkin at his home Sunday after receiving a welfare call, and a spokeswoman with the medical examiner\u2019s office, Beverly Fields, said the cause and manner of death had not yet been determined.\n\n\u201cFrom a D.C. politics standpoint, this feels a bit like Tim Russert\u2019s passing did for U.S. politics,\u201d the D.C. Council posted on its Twitter account. \u201cThere was quality commentary before him, there will be after, but it\u2019s never quite the same.\u201d\n\nCelebrated for his deep institutional knowledge of Washington-area politics, Mr. Plotkin was often called upon by television and print reporters for his insight into the inner workings of the John A. Wilson Building, the mayor and council\u2019s home on Pennsylvania Avenue NW.\n\nBut he was known less as a dispassionate journalist than as a cantankerous, sometimes bombastic commentator and rabble-rouser, described by friends as a kind of P.T. Barnum for the issues of D.C. statehood and voting rights.\n\nMr. Plotkin dubbed the city America\u2019s \u201clast colony,\u201d because its 700,000 taxpaying residents do not get a vote in Congress, and he was thrown out of the White House in 2007 after asking first lady Laura Bush a question about statehood. He called himself \u201cAmerica\u2019s guest\u201d while attending the 2016 Republican National Convention, where he sought to rally politicians behind making the District the 51st state, and would have attended Thursday\u2019s House hearings on statehood were he not sidelined by illness, Segraves said.\n\nA former advance man for the Democratic presidential campaigns of Edmund Muskie, Eugene McCarthy and George McGovern, Mr. Plotkin entered radio broadcasting in the 1980s as a political commentator at WAMU (88.5 FM), the District\u2019s public radio station.\n\nNotable deaths in 2019: Ric Ocasek, Valerie Harper, Ross Perot, Toni Morrison, and others we have lost this year share Share Email this link Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn View Photos View Photos Next Image Cokie Roberts | Cokie Roberts, a journalist and political commentator who became one of the most prominent Washington broadcasters of her era and championed young women in media during a long career with NPR and ABC News, died Sept. 17 in Washington. She was 75. Read the obituary (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nHe led a Friday public-affairs program with Mike Cuthbert and later Derek McGinty, covering the District\u2019s financial turmoil and Mayor Marion Barry with a biting style \u201cas reminiscent of Martin and Lewis as it is of Jennings and Brinkley,\u201d Washington Post journalist Marc Fisher wrote in 1997. Mr. Plotkin eventually recruited Kojo Nnamdi, current host of \u201cThe Politics Hour,\u201d to join him in the studio.\n\nIn 2000, he galvanized an effort to replace the District license plate slogan \u201cCelebrate & Discover\u201d with \u201cTaxation Without Representation,\u201d an idea suggested to him in an email from one of his listeners.\n\nMr. Plotkin moved to the all-news station WTOP (103.5 FM) in 2002, where he continued to work as a commentator before being dismissed in 2012 after berating a colleague, according to a Washington Post report at the time.\n\n\u201cThis will hurt me as a peripheral figure here in D.C.,\u201d he joked to The Post after his ouster, noting that he would continue doing commentary for the Canadian broadcaster CTV, \u201cbut I\u2019ll still be a major international figure.\u201d\n\nMr. Plotkin also did commentary for WTTG (Channel 5) and the BBC, and wrote columns and op-ed pieces for publications including The Post, the Hill and Legal Times. But he never limited himself entirely to journalism: In the 1980s, he won two terms on the D.C. Democratic State Committee and twice ran unsuccessfully for D.C. Council.\n\nHe also exerted his influence on the air, notably after the cash-strapped D.C. government agreed in 1995 to turn over most of the Wilson Building in exchange for a roughly $50 million renovation overseen by developer T. Conrad Monts. The Environmental Protection Agency was slated to move into two-thirds of the building, with the District effectively consigned to whatever room it could find.\n\nFor three years, Mr. Plotkin devoted much of his radio program to the issue. He ultimately convinced council member Jack Evans to write a letter to President Bill Clinton, signed by \u00adEvans\u2019s colleagues on the council, calling for help. Soon after, EPA Administrator Carol Browner told District officials her agency would look elsewhere for space.\n\n\u201cMore than any D.C. official, Plotkin paved the way for the deal ensuring that the Wilson Building will remain the one place on Pennsylvania Avenue that D.C. folks can call their own,\u201d journalist David Carr, then the editor of Washington City Paper, wrote in 1999. The D.C. Council later described Mr. Plotkin\u2019s role in the episode as \u201cdecisive\u201d; his picture was reportedly hung outside the building.\n\n\u201cI admit to being a maniac on this issue, but what was happening was so perverse, so obscene, that it could not go unopposed,\u201d Mr. Plotkin told City Paper. \u201cYou know, in this city, when you believe passionately in something and fight hard for it, you are marginalized and viewed as a zealot. Well, I think this place could use a little zealotry. We are an abused citizenry that lacks a sense of place and is so used to accepting crumbs that we were willing to go along with this. And I couldn\u2019t stand to see apathy carry the day.\u201d\n\nMark L. Plotkin was born in Mason City, Iowa, on April 10, 1947. Raised in Chicago, he grew up listening to Len O\u2019Connor, a radio and television commentator who spurred an early interest in politics \u2014 especially the rough-and-tumble sort he prized in Chicago. (By comparison, District politics had \u201cno character, no pizazz, no flair,\u201d in his view.)\n\nMr. Plotkin attended George Washington University partly to escape the Midwest, and graduated in 1969 on what he described as the \u201cfive-year plan,\u201d playing on the tennis team while studying American history.\n\nHe taught at schools in Chicago and Washington before switching his focus to politics by 1972, and later served as a deputy finance director for the presidential campaigns of Morris K. Udall, Edward M. Kennedy and Gary Hart.\n\nIn radio, Mr. Plotkin acquired a reputation for a short temper, and \u201cengaged in at least a dozen shouting matches with colleagues,\u201d according to The Post, before his departure from WTOP.\n\n\u201cMark is a package deal,\u201d Nnamdi said in 2012. \u201cYou get his remarkable institutional knowledge, the encyclopedia of politics he carries around in his head, his passion for [District] voting rights \u2014 and you get a whole lot of attitude. His assets are his defects. They\u2019re inseparable and they\u2019re one and the same.\u201d\n\nFor his commentaries, Mr. Plotkin won a regional Edward R. Murrow Award in 2010 for excellence in writing. He has no immediate surviving family members and was never married, according to Segraves.\n\nIn a sign of Mr. Plotkin\u2019s standing in the District, a 2018 ceremony marking the donation of his papers to George Washington University drew former mayors Sharon Pratt, Anthony Williams and Vincent C. Gray; council members Evans and Mary M. Cheh; and Mayor Muriel E. Bowser, who declared March 29, 2018, Mark Plotkin Day in the District.\n\n\u201cWhen statehood happens for D.C.,\u201d Pratt said at the event, \u201cwrit large will be the name of Mark Plotkin.\u201d\n\nRead more Washington Post obituaries\n\nChristopher Rouse, expressionistic composer who won Pulitzer Prize, dies at 70\n\nRobert Boyd, journalist who shared Pulitzer for Eagleton shock therapy revelations, dies at 91\n\nStuart Levy, microbiologist who sounded alarm on antibiotic resistance, dies at 80", "description": "He worked for radio stations WAMU and WTOP and was a fixture of Washington politics.", "authors": ["Harrison Smith", "Obituary Writer"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NA56V2G6DYI6TMMZ6Y4L6LBUB4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
