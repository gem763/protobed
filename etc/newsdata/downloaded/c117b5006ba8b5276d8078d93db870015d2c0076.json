Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 12, 2019\n\nHe further vowed that no one in his family will have \u201cany business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or foreign country\u201d.\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s work overseas sits at the centre of the House impeachment inquiry into Mr Trump, who has admitted asking foreign powers to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings abroad.\n\nThe White House released a rough transcript of a call in which Mr Trump asks Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to probe Mr Biden\u2019s family and Ukraine\u2019s role in the 2016 election that put Mr Trump in office.\n\nMr Trump has also encouraged China to dig into Hunter Biden\u2019s work in that country, asserting without evidence that earned 1.5 billion US dollar from a \u201csweetheart\u201d business deal there.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (Kevin Wolf/AP)\n\nThe president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, is also under increasing scrutiny for his efforts to dig into Hunter Biden\u2019s business background.\n\nLate last week, two businessmen involved in Mr Giuliani\u2019s efforts to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s dealings in Ukraine were charged with federal campaign finance violations.\n\nStill, Republicans reacted to news of Hunter Biden\u2019s decision to step away from the Chinese-backed BHR Equity Investment Fund Management Co with deep scepticism.\n\n\u201cI think this is just another way to save a flailing campaign that\u2019s going down,\u201d Georgia Representative Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said on Fox News Channel\u2019s Sunday Morning Futures.\n\n\u201c\u2018He knows he\u2019s in trouble and this is just another way to try and detract attention.\u201d\n\nOn the same show, White House counsellor Kellyanne Conway said Hunter Biden \u201cshould have done this quite a while ago\u201d.\n\nMr Mesires noted repeatedly that there is no evidence of wrongdoing against Hunter Biden, despite intensifying attacks from Mr Trump before the 2020 election.\n\nDonald Trump is a threat to our democracy. He must be impeached. \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 13, 2019\n\n\u201cDespite extensive scrutiny, at no time has any law enforcement agency, either domestic or foreign, alleged that Hunter engaged in wrongdoing at any point during his five-year term,\u201d Mr Mesires said in his Sunday post of Biden\u2019s experience in Ukraine.\n\nThe lawyer wrote that Hunter Biden worked as an unpaid board member for BHR Equity Investment Fund Management Co \u201cbased on his interest in seeking ways to bring Chinese capital to international markets\u201d.\n\n\u201cTo date, Hunter has not received any compensation for being on BHR\u2019s board of directors,\u201d Mr Mesires said.\n\n\u201cHe has not received any return on his investment; there have been no distributions to BHR shareholders since Hunter obtained his equity interest.\u201d\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy (Efrem Lukatsky/AP)\n\nOne of Mr Biden\u2019s Democratic presidential rivals praised the move, noting that Mr Trump\u2019s children are openly trading on his name in business deals around the world while Mr Trump occupies the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cI think it demonstrates the difference in standards relative to the White House,\u201d said Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana.\n\n\u201cI mean, here you have Hunter Biden stepping down from a position in order to make sure, even though there\u2019s been no accusation of wrongdoing \u2014 doing something just to make sure there\u2019s not even the appearance of a conflict of interests, while, in the White House, the president of the United States is a walking conflict of interest,\u201d he said.", "description": "Hunter Biden\u00b4s decision comes amid intense scrutiny from President Donald Trump against Mr Biden senior, his potential opponent next year.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/12/wire-19689410-1571051649-332_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
