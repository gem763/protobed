It was a small moment, but it speaks to how easy it would have been for the cashier to ignore a young Latina mother struggling to care for her child had there not been someone around to interpret. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she kept saying, though the mother\u2019s gestures transcended language. I choose not to understand is what she really meant.\n\nThose of us who grew up bilingual understand the complexities of holding onto and embracing either language. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez recently said on Twitter, \u201cGrowing up, Spanish was my first language \u2014 but like many 1st generation Latinx Americans, I have to continuously work at it & improve. It\u2019s not perfect.\u201d\n\nIn the Spanish spoken by the children of immigrants, you\u2019ll hear the echoes of cousins laughing at our accents when we visited them in Latin America. If you go back one generation, you\u2019ll hear stories of people like my in-laws, whose teachers in Florida beat them for speaking in school the language they spoke at home. Go back yet another generation and you\u2019ll hear of the state-sanctioned racial terror inflicted on residents of Mexican descent in Texas in the late 1800s and early 1900s.\n\nOn videos circulating on social media you\u2019ll hear Americans harassing Spanish-speakers at supermarkets and restaurants. This language of xenophobia and white supremacy is spoken fluently by our own president, and is at the root of why generations of Latinx Americans\u2019 relationship with Spanish is laced with pain.\n\nThose whose parents tried to shield them from discrimination by not passing it on are often expected to be fluent in a language they never had the chance to forget. Those of us who managed to hold on to it, despite the pressures to assimilate, know that our imperfect Spanish is a privilege we are often shamed for both inside and outside of our communities. And those of us who speak only Spanish are too often dismissed and worse, targeted \u2014 by women pushing shopping carts, by ICE raids, by gunmen with anti-immigrant manifestoes. Their terror makes victims of us all.", "description": "The bittersweet discovery that language, and the stories it carries, is not a straight path.", "authors": ["Natalia Sylvester"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/19/opinion/19sylvester/19sylvester-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
