The answer is (to my mind) it doesn\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s a gay love story: well, the debate now has moved onto trans issues, which weren\u2019t even dreamed of then.\n\nIt\u2019s about a Pakistani business class epitomised by Kammy Darweish\u2019s Thatcher-supporting Nasser, who embraces Britain on the basis that \u2018you just need to squeeze the t*ts of the system\u2019 and the incessant racism Pakistanis had to weather. That doesn\u2019t travel either, now there\u2019s a British-Pakistani Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nYet this \u2014 a joint effort with the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry, Everyman in Cheltenham and Leeds Playhouse \u2014 is certainly a classy show, with Kureishi\u2019s own script preserving the wit and human warmth of the original screenplay.\n\nThe music, created specially for the production by the Pet Shop Boys, is an excellent add-on; it carries the piece along.\n\nAnd the two Pakistani elders are the stars: Papa, the alcoholic savant, played with humorous disillusionment by the original Omar, Gordon Warnecke; and Kammy Darweish\u2019s Nasser, a failed but funny patriarch.\n\nOh, and it helps that Omar \u2014 played by Omar Malik \u2014 and Johnny, the warmhearted fascist-sympathiser portrayed by Jonny Fines, are both pretty hot. Their mutual desire seems real.\n\nLots to admire, but it\u2019s not a play for our time.", "description": "Author Hanif Kureishi has translated the film to the stage in a production at the Curve in Leicester, which has a large Asian population, under the direction of Nikolai Foster.", "authors": ["Melanie Mcdonagh For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/27/12/19006376-0-image-a-72_1569582094993.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
