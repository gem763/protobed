We\u2019re thinking of you up there, we love you Grandad Ted.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018It\u2019s so disappointing\u2019 \u2013\n\nEarlier in Oita, May scored the first two of England\u2019s four tries in three first-half minutes as the Red Roses reached their first semi-final since 2007.\n\nKyle Sinckler and Anthony Watson crossed in the second half and 20 points flowed from Owen Farrell\u2019s perfect kicking as Jones\u2019s men throttled the Wallabies\u2019 attempts to claw their way back into it.\n\n\u201cWe did what\u2019s needed. We had the lead and obviously Australia were throwing everything at us,\u201d said Farrell. \u201cWe wanted to play the game at our pace not theirs, and we did that in the second half.\u201d\n\nWith his contract up after the World Cup, the defeat appears to have ended Michael Cheika\u2019s five-year stint as Wallabies coach whose highlight was reaching the World Cup final in 2015.\n\n\u201cI was supposed to get this done for the people here and the Australians. It\u2019s so disappointing,\u201d said a disconsolate Cheika, a former team-mate of Jones at Sydney\u2019s Randwick club.\n\nAustralia looked dangerous early on but England seized the advantage with May\u2019s rapid try double.\n\nEngland stretched the Australian defence as they attacked right and then left, before man of the match Tom Curry drew the final defender to give the left wing an easy score in the corner.\n\nHenry Slade then intercepted the ball on halfway and raced towards the try-line before chipping into space with a kick that was deftly gathered by the England wing.\n\nThree Christian Lealiifano penalties kept Australia in touch at 17-9 at half-time, and they came storming back after the restart when Marika Koroibete skinned Elliot Daly to cross for the Wallabies.\n\nBut England hit back almost immediately when Farrell picked out Sinckler with a bullet pass and the prop burst through a gap for his first international try.\n\nWatson\u2019s late intercept try completed the job for England, who equalled their record margin of victory against Australia \u2014 and beat them for a third time in the World Cup quarter-finals.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 The All Blacks overwhelmed Ireland 46-14 and England thumped their old enemy Australia to set up a blockbuster semi-final at the Rugby", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/cfbf26_new-zealand-stretched-winning-streak-18-world-cup-games-new-zealand-england-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
