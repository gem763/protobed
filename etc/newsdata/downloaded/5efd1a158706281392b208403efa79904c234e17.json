From fighting Trump, to campaigning for abortion rights, the actor has form for doing the decent thing\n\nAs if politics can\u2019t get any weirder, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, has been pulled up by the Hollywood actor Mark Ruffalo for misappropriating the Hulk. In an interview at the weekend, Johnson said he would break off the \u201cmanacles\u201d of Europe. \u201cHulk always escaped, no matter how tightly bound in he seemed to be \u2013 and that is the case for this country,\u201d said the PM, adding: \u201cThe madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets.\u201d\n\nTo which Ruffalo, who plays the verdant superhero, tweeted: \u201cBoris Johnson forgets that the Hulk only fights for the good of the whole. Mad and strong can also be dense and destructive. The Hulk works best when he is in unison with a team, and is a disaster when he is alone.\u201d Here are some other times Ruffalo has done the decent thing.\n\nOn abortion rights\n\nRuffalo has been vocal in his support for reproductive rights. In 2013, he published a powerful open letter to be read out during a pro-choice campaign, in which he wrote about the \u201ctraumatising\u201d and \u201cdemeaning\u201d illegal abortion his mother had undergone. \u201cDo we actually stand for anything, if what we do stand for is under attack and we say nothing?\u201d he wrote.\n\nOn the climate crisis\n\nHe has regularly championed environmental causes, in particular campaigning against fracking and co-founding the Solutions Project, an organisation to promote renewable energy. His petition, ahead of the G7 summit in 2015, to get leaders to commit to renewable energy got more than 3 million signatures.\n\nOn presidential candidates\n\nHe urged Elizabeth Warren to run for president in 2016, then supported Bernie Sanders before throwing his celebrity weight behind Hillary Clinton. \u201cArt and artists have always had a hand in political movements, in shifts in cultural thinking. It\u2019s part of our cultural function,\u201d he told Salon in 2013 when asked if actors should put their heads above the parapet.\n\nOn the US border crisis\n\nLast year, in a campaign video, Ruffalo and the rapper Common spoke out about the policy of separating families at the US border. Ruffalo described it as a \u201chumanitarian crisis\u201d.\n\nOn the anti-Trump resistance\n\nRuffalo was one of a number of leftwing celebrities who held a rally, organised by the newly formed campaign group We Stand United, in New York ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. \u201cFor every actor and celebrity that went on stage, there was an environmentalist out there, or a civil-rights specialist, a labour person or someone in healthcare,\u201d Ruffalo said. The high-profile activists, who also included Cher and Robert de Niro, provided the star wattage \u201cto help people who are actually fighting the fight have their voices heard\u201d. Last year, Ruffalo helped create the People\u2019s State of the Union, a night of speeches and music, to \u201chear it from the people who are really out there working so hard for this nation every single day\u201d.", "description": "The Hollywood star has been putting Boris Johnson right over the PM\u2019s Hulk reference.
