It is testing home deliveries in a rural area around Blacksburg, Virginia.\n\nAmazon, known for its splashy drone delivery tests, has also won certifications to test its drones.\n\nThe FAA is writing rules for drone operations - including guidelines for sharing airspace with passenger planes and for flying over populated areas.\n\nResidential deliveries, Price said, are \"years out\".", "description": "Ahead of its rivals, Flight Forward receives approval for package deliveries on university and hospital campuses.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/1/11d0ccac95c44e66a6169c065defbad3_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
