As an example, the new BOMBARDIER ZEFIRO Express train is designed for high-capacity, premium passenger comfort, low life cycle costs, and the ability to operate under the harsh weather conditions prevalent in the Nordics. The ZEFIRO Express has been chosen by Swedish operator V\u00e4sttrafik to meet high demand for public transport in the V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland region. Production of the new trains is underway with deliveries planned in 2021.\n\n\n\nA ZEFIRO Express battery-electric multiple unit (BEMU) train has also been designed by Bombardier for distances of up to 100 kilometres on non-electrified railways. At the Nordic Future Transport summit, visitors are invited to a presentation about this new generation of battery-powered trains by Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m, Bombardier\u2019s Head of Sales Nordic, on Tuesday, October 8, at 13:00-13:40.\n\nRailway modernization is a major trend across the world and Bombardier\u2019s response is to leverage digital technology to increase capacity and safety on the railways. At this Nordic Rail exhibition, Bombardier will highlight its latest European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) technology. The Swedish Transport Administration, Trafikverket, has chosen the BOMBARDIER INTERFLO 450 ERTMS solution for the modernisation of its Malmbanan line. When complete, the INTERFLO rail control system will increase the performance of the railway with higher capacity and availability, as well as lower life cycle costs, as already proven on very high-speed lines in China. The BOMBARDIER CITYFLO mass transit technology will also be presented at the show. The CITYFLO solution optimises capacity and reliability on existing and new rail systems in cities across the world and is ideally suited for cost-efficient migration to communication-based train control (CBTC).\n\nThe Bombardier team will be available to discuss latest technologies and solutions, as well as progress on current projects, and to share perspectives on the future of mobility in the Nordics. Bombardier is also pleased to invite Nordic Rail visitors to a series of \u2018Ten Minute Talks\u2019 on its exhibition stand covering a range of mobility topics (for information, see link to event website below or visit the stand).\n\nNordic Rail is the only dedicated railway exhibition in Scandinavia.
