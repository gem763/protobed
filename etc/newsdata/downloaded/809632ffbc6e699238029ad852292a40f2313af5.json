The crowd was going pretty nuts. It was ear-piercing. Everybody\u2019s wanted me to score for quite a while so to see everyone get as excited as they did, it\u2019s pretty special. It means a lot.\u201d\n\nHe ended the longest goal drought to start a career in Canadiens history, a mark previously held by Mike Komisarek at 122 games. It also ended the longest active drought in the league.\n\n\u201cThe fans saw him score his first goal and they made sure to show him their support,\u201d coach Claude Julien said. \u201cNo doubt, it\u2019s going to be engraved in his mind. Definitely a special night for him.\u201d\n\nMete\u2019s goal was the first of three for Montreal in a 4:46 span last in the first period.\n\nThe 21-year-old Mete found space in the slot, took a backhand pass from Nick Cousins from behind the net and beat Alex Stalock glove side with 5:23 left in the period.\n\n\u201cI heard Mete yell for it so I just kind of whipped it out front and he was nice enough to bury it,\u201d said Cousins, who was making his Canadiens debut. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was his first goal. That\u2019s exciting for him. I like my steak medium rare. We\u2019ll have to figure that out tomorrow for dinner. He\u2019s buying for sure.\u201d\n\nJoel Armia and Brendan Gallagher also scored to help Montreal improve to 3-2-2.\n\nStalock stopped 28 shots for the reeling Wild. They dropped to 1-6-0.\n\nArmia connected on a 5-on-3 power play with 2:28 left in the first. He leads Montreal with four goal.\n\nSuzuki scored with 37 seconds remaining in the period. A whiffed shot from Jeff Petry landed right on Suzuki\u2019s backhand before Stalock could cover the right post.\n\nGallagher put a fourth past Stalock at 12:40 of the third period.\n\nNOTES: The Canadiens beat Minnesota for the first time since Nov. 8, 2014, snapping a streak of nine losses. \u2026 Mete and Suzuki are the first Canadiens to score their first NHL goals in the same game since 2005, when Chris Higgins and Alexander Perezhogin did it against the New York Rangers.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWild: Host Montreal on Sunday.\n\nCanadiens: At St. Louis on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It sounded like an overtime goal in the playoffs.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/17/wild_canadiens_hockey_72541_c0-121-4597-2802_s1200x700.jpg?37044001bbe74e06b7385b8ba91856248511155f", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
