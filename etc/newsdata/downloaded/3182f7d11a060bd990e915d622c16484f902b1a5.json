In an Instagram post after his first practice, Harry shared a photo of him in action with the caption \u201cFelt great to be back out there wit the boys. #GodsPlan.\u201d Veteran quarterback Tom Brady gave words of encouragement to Harry, commenting \u201clet\u2019s keep it going\u201d.\n\nMuch is expected from Harry, the first wide receiver taken by Patriots' Head Coach Bill Belichick in the first round of the NFL Draft. Harry still has to remain in the injured reserve for two more weeks before he can return to action. Meaning, Harry will be sidelined until Week 9 when they take on the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nIf he plays, Harry can provide much-needed depth to the Patriots' wide receiving corps consisting of Julian Edelman, Josh Gordon, Phillip Dorsett, Jakobi Meyers, and Gunner Olszewski.\n\nHowever, it also remains to be seen if Brady will trust Harry as a consistent target on offense. The Patriots are reportedly eyeing a veteran wide receiver before the Oct. 29 trade deadline, who can provide immediate help for Brady. The 42-year-old Brady only had three touchdown passes with three interceptions in his last three games after recording seven scoring strikes with no picks in his first three outings. The undefeated Patriots will next face the New York Jets on Monday Night Football at Metlife Stadium.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news! Click on the topic you interest most.

NFL New England Patriots\n\nDorsett helping Harry\u2019s transition\n\nIn an interview, veteran wide receiver Phillip Dorsett said he\u2019s helping Harry transition back onto the field after missing a significant portion of the Patriots\u2019 regular season. \u201cJust making sure that he\u2019s in shape mentally, physically, emotionally, making sure he\u2019s ready to play,\u2019 said Dorsett, whose Gillette Stadium locker is next to Harry\u2019s. According to Dorsett, Harry has some catching up to do but believes that he will be fine.\n\nAs one of the team\u2019s veterans, Dorsett said Harry can help the Patriots succeed if the rookie wide receiver succeeds on the field. \u201cWe all have one goal. We want to win. And we know that he knows that he can help us win,\u201d Dorsett stressed.\n\nBrady hoping for tackle Isaiah Wynn\u2019s return from IR\n\nAside from Harry, the Patriots can activate another player from the injured reserve provided that he was on the 53-man roster before he hit the IR.\n\nUnder that condition, the Patriots can activate only one of four players, including fullbacks James Develin and Jakob Johnson, kicker Stephen Gostkowski and tackle Isaiah Wynn. In an interview with Jim Gray of Westwood One, Brady said he\u2019s hoping that it could be Wynn, his starting left tackle in their Week 1 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. \u201cWe have one (player) that we\u2019re hoping can return from injury: Isaiah Wynn, who was our left tackle to start the year,\u201d Brady said.\n\nWynn is eligible to return to practice after the Patriots\u2019 Week 9 matchup with the Ravens.", "description": "Harry is eligible to return in Week 9 when they take on the Baltimore Ravens.", "authors": ["Music Crowns", "Zeegee Cecilio", "Oliver Vandervoort", "Read More On The Same Topic Zeegee Cecilio", "Jets Quarterback Sam Darnold On Showdown With Patriots", "I Want To Play The Best", "Tony Romo Believes Patriots Might Go Undefeated", "Patriots Early Favorite Over Jets", "Patriots Rumor", "Insider Points To Fitzgerald"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/16/os/b_1200x630/harry-was-selected-32nd-overall-by-the-patriots-in-the-2019-nfl-draft-image-credit-new-england-patriotsyoutube_2339977.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
