In each episode of Forage, he teaches us how to source in-season ingredients from our own backyards and sustainably forage them, before turning them into a delicious dish we can make and devour in our own kitchens.\n\nWhen we think of apple picking, our minds typically go to the orchards that open to the public every autumn, but there are actually wild apples hanging in forests all across Canada, just waiting to be harvested. According to chef Shawn Adler, wild apples, or crabapples, are a great edible for any beginner forager to start with as they\u2019re easy to spot, incredibly flavourful and a cinch to cook with. Check out the video below for his full guide to foraging crabapples ethically, then scroll down for the recipe that\u2019ll turn your findings into a delicious autumnal dessert.\n\nChef Shawn Adler explains why wild apples are an ideal \u2018first forage\u2019 and how to source them sustainably. 3:40\n\nRed Wine-Poached Crabapple\n\nIngredients\n\n1 cup brown sugar\n\n1 tsp black pepper\n\n4 whole star anise\n\n1 bottle red wine\n\n1 cup goat cheese\n\n\u00bc cup honey\n\nMicrogreens, for serving\n\nCandied walnuts, for serving\n\nEdible flowers, for serving\n\nPreparation\n\nBegin by peeling and each apple and coring with a melon baller. Set aside.\n\nIn a medium pot, combine the brown sugar, pepper, star anise and red wine. Stir to dissolve the sugar and bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Add in the apples and poach until just tender. This will take roughly 20 minutes but each apple\u2019s timing may be different depending on its variety and ripeness. Test doneness by poking an apple with a paring knife.\n\nOnce the apples are tender, remove pot from heat and let cool at room temperature for 20 minutes or so. Then, place the entire pot with liquid and apples in the fridge and allow to cool completely or 1-2 hours or overnight.\n\nOnce the apples have cooled you can prepare the filling. In a small bowl, stir together the goat cheese and honey. Fill each apple\u2019s hollow core with the goat cheese mixture. Plate on a bed of microgreens and top with candied walnuts and edible flowers.", "description": "Chef Shawn Adler explains why wild apples are an ideal \u2018first forage\u2019 and how to source them sustainably.", "authors": ["Cbc Life"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5312224.1570474700!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/crabapples.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
