I would not,\u201d said Kemp, who is black. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t understand the anger. And I guess I could say if you profess religious beliefs and you are going to follow them, I would hope that they not be situational and limited to one race only.\u201d\n\nKemp walked over to Guyger shortly after Brandt Jean hugged and forgave her for fatally shooting his brother, Botham Jean, in his own apartment. The jury sentenced Guyger, who testified that she mistook Jean's apartment for her own and thought he was an intruder, to 10 years in prison last week.\n\nHow many years will Amber Guyger serve?: That could depend on Botham Jean's family\n\nGuyger asked twice if Kemp could also hug her, the judge said, and Kemp obliged after a moment's hesitation. Kemp said she saw Guyger change during her trial and wants her to live a purposeful life.\n\nState District Judge Tammy Kemp gives former Dallas Police Officer Amber Guyger a hug before Guyger leaves for jail, Wednesday, Oct. 2, 2019, in Dallas. More\n\nCritics called Kemp's actions unethical and one group requested a judicial misconduct investigation. The Freedom From Religion Foundation, a secular Wisconsin-based group that routinely files lawsuits challenging religious displays in government, filed a complaint saying Kemp was proselytizing from the bench.\n\nKemp contended she hugged Guyger after the legal proceeding was over, noting the interaction was not part of the official trial record.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do that from the bench,\u201d she said. \u201cI came down to extend my condolences to the Jean family and to encourage Ms. Guyger because she has a lot of life to live.\u201d\n\n'We need answers': Key witness in ex-Dallas officer Amber Guyger\u2019s murder trial shot and killed\n\nSome activists also criticized the hugs for taking focus off anger at a police killing of an unarmed black man. Jean's mother, Allison, called for reform in the Dallas Police Department, telling \"CBS This Morning\" she did not want her son's actions to be \"misconstrued as a complete forgiveness.\"\n\nKemp said she does not know if Guyger is Christian, but noted the former officer told her she didn't have a Bible. When Guyger asked if God could forgive her, Kemp said she answered, \"Yes, God can forgive you, and has.\"\n\n\u201cIf she wanted to start with the Bible, I didn\u2019t want her to go back to the jail and to sink into doubt and self-pity and become bitter,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause she still has a lot of life ahead of her following her sentence and I would hope that she could live it purposefully.\u201d\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Amber Guyger: Judge Tammy Kemp defends hugging, giving Bible", "description": "Judge Tammy Kemp, who hugged and gave Amber Guyger a Bible after she was sentenced to\u00a0prison, said her actions were appropriate.", "authors": ["Kristin Lam", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MS5norrjzTmBiNpwC2ppFw--~B/aD00MTkxO3c9NjA0MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/3d123c3f64bc58c046cf600fd4cf792e", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
