Many of them built Britain, but were subjected to cruelty and forced into inhumane conditions.\u2019\n\nThe petition calls on the \u2018Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) to fund the first dedicated major memorial to Enslaved Africans before the deadline\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMemorial 2007 says the government has rejected previous demands to fund the memorial on the basis that it \u2018does not have any dedicated funds available at present\u2019.\n\nLast-ditch effort for Forever 21 as it faces becoming latest high street casualty\n\nIt goes on to list examples of government support for memorials for World War One, Commonwealth War Graves, the Holocaust, as well as the Srebrenica Genocide and asks the same for slave trade victims too.\n\nThe demand coincides with Black History month, and the petition warns that \u2018to lose this opportunity to build a landmark would be a grave shame and a social injustice\u2019.\n\nAn MHCLG spokesperson said: \u2018We carefully consider each request for funding. Memorial 2007 approached MHCLG last year and the Department was unable to provide support at that time.\n\n\u2018We are supportive of the aims of the monument and the organisation. The suffering caused by slavery and the slave trade are among the most dishonourable and abhorrent chapters in human history.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
