The IAAF has also been accused of treating some of its stars as \u201cguinea pigs\u201d by making marathon runners and race walkers compete in 31C heat and high humidity.\n\nAmid signs of a growing backlash, Belarus\u2019s Volha Mazuronak, who finished fifth in the women\u2019s marathon in the early hours of Saturday morning, claimed the sport\u2019s governing body had shown disrespect by staging the race outdoors. Just 40 out of 68 runners finished the race, and several others were carried off the course on stretchers looking in a bad way. \u201cThe humidity kills you,\u201d Mazuronak said. \u201cThere is nothing to breathe. I thought I wouldn\u2019t finish. It\u2019s disrespect towards the athletes. A bunch of high-ranked officials gathered and decided that it would take the world championships here but they are sitting in the cool and they are probably sleeping right now.\u201d\n\nWorld Athletics Championships 2019: day two \u2013 live! Read more\n\nCanada\u2019s Lyndsay Tessier, who finished ninth, added: \u201cYou see somebody down on the course and it\u2019s just extremely grounding and scary. That could be you in the next kilometre, the next 500m. It was really scary and intimidating and daunting. I\u2019m just really grateful to have finished standing up.\u201d\n\nAlthough track-and-field athletes are helped by an air-conditioned stadium, which reduces the temperature to 23C, the marathon and walking races are held outside. That led to obvious frustration among many athletes and teams at the women\u2019s marathon, which started a minute before midnight on Friday, with the Ethiopian squad\u2019s marathon coach, Haji Adillo Roba, saying: \u201cWe never would have run a marathon in these conditions in our own country.\u201d\n\nThe IAAF defended its decision to hold the race in the severest of conditions, despite 30 athletes visiting the medical centre as a precaution afterwards. It pointed out that the race was completed without any cases of heat stroke, \u201cdespite very challenging weather conditions for endurance events\u201d.\n\nIt added: \u201cIn the women\u2019s marathon 68 competitors started and 40 finished \u2013 which is comparable to the completion rate at previous world championships in Tokyo (1991) and Moscow (2013) \u2026 Thirty athletes visited the medical centre as a precaution. A small number were kept under observation and one athlete was referred to the hospital for observation but later released.\u201d\n\nHowever the IAAF\u2019s response continues to frustrate some athletes. France\u2019s Yohann Diniz, who is attempting to retain his world title in the 50km walk, accused athletics governing body was treating athletes as \u201cguinea pigs\u201d by staging their races outside rather in the air-conditioned Khalifa International Stadium. \u201cI am extremely upset,\u201d he added. \u201cIf we were in the stadium we would have normal conditions, but outside they have placed us in a furnace, which is just not possible.\u201d\n\nBut it is the criticisms from Mayer, who is one of the top stars in the sport, that will sting the IAAF the most. \u201cWe can all see it\u2019s a disaster, there is no one in the stands, and the heat has not been adapted at all,\u201d the Frenchman told L\u2019\u00c9quipe. \u201cThere have already been nearly 30 withdrawals in the women\u2019s marathon. It\u2019s sad.\n\n\u201cWe have to leave reason aside and concentrate more on the passion, because if not I would have boycotted these championships. We haven\u2019t really prioritised athletes when organising the championships here. It makes it difficult.\u201d\n\nTeam officials are also expressing their concerns. One said: \u201cThis is making the Daegu world championships in 2011 look like paradise.\u201d\n\nOn the track, Britain\u2019s Dina Asher-Smith cruised into Sunday\u2019s 100m semi\u2011finals with an efficient and easy-looking 10.97sec. However, she was given a stark warning over what it will take to win gold by the performance of 2012 Olympic champion Shelly-Ann Fraser\u2011Pryce, who qualified in 10.80 \u2013 the fastest ever time in a world championships heats.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dina Asher-Smith in action. Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters\n\nAsher-Smith was one of the few athletes who did not stop to speak afterwards but Fraser-Pryce was clearly delighted with her short evening\u2019s work. \u201cIt was a good run,\u201d the Jamaican Fraser-Pryce added. \u201cThis is my first championships after two years [after having a baby in 2017] so I\u2019m excited to be back. I tried to execute the best way possible because my technique is not the best. There are so many talented women and it is a blessing to do it again.\u201d\n\nAmong those who impressed was the Marie-Jos\u00e9e Ta Lou, a silver medallist in the 100m and 200m in London two years ago, who ran a personal best of 10.85 in her heat.\n\nBritain\u2019s Daryll Neita, the fifth fastest qualifier in a personal best time of 11.12, said she was stunned at her time. \u201cI am really happy,\u201d she added after finishing behind Fraser-Pryce. \u201cI looked at my heat and thought: \u2018Oh, I have to run really well here.\u2019 It was great to be second to a 10.8.\u201d", "description": "Athletes say there is not enough air to breathe as they suffer in Doha\u2019s heat and humidity", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01278a69462c0d1425e874087b66aa41a4a09ce7/0_58_2141_1284/master/2141.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cf094929f08148163c44adb7f83d0883", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
