Residents who may have been able to escape were told to stay in their flats, before the policy was eventually abandoned at 2.47am\n\nThe report, which will be made public on Wednesday, is expected to criticise the London Fire Brigade for a number of failings, including telling residents to \u2018stay put\u2019 for hours as the blaze tore through the 24-storey west London tower block.\n\nBut the bereaved, survivors and residents will have to sign a gagging order before they can lay eyes on the report\u2019s damning details.\n\nMoyra Samuels, from the Justice for Grenfell campaign group, told The Daily Telegraph: \u2018You never know\u2019 if families would be prosecuted for discussing or sharing the report before its official release.\n\n\u2018They can\u2019t discuss the contents of the report with the media. I can\u2019t see how they\u2019re going to prosecute them but you never know. I think they\u2019re all meant to sign a non-disclosure agreement.\n\n\u2018I think they\u2019ll be expected to because the way that it is going to go is [Sir Martin] Moore-Bick is going to go through key headlines within the report and then as they leave they have to sign the non-disclosure and they\u2019ll be given the physical copy.\u2019\n\nThe revelation follows comments earlier this month from Doreen Lawrence, the mother of Stephen Lawrence, who told Channel 4 News that she is concerned the bereaved are not having their voices heard.\n\nThose who lost family and friends \u2013 and those who escaped the inferno which killed 72 \u2013 will meet Sir Martin Moore-Bick, chairman of the Grenfell Tower Inquiry, today. They will receive an embargoed copy of a report. People are pictured paying tribute to victims two years on in June 2019\n\nThe controversial \u2018stay put\u2019 policy is expected to feature heavily in the report.\n\nDr Barbara Lane, a leading fire engineer, has previously told the inquiry the strategy had substantially failed by 1.26am \u2013 32 minutes after the first call to firefighters.\n\nResidents who may have been able to escape were told to stay in their flats, before the policy was eventually abandoned at 2.47am.\n\nA spokesman for the Grenfell Tower Inquiry said: \u2018The Report is being provided under embargo to all core participants in line with Rule 17 of the Inquiry Rules 2006. All core participants...will need to sign an NDA, as the report will not be made public until Wednesday.\u2019", "description": "Those who lost family and friends - and those who escaped the inferno which killed 72 - will meet Sir Martin Moore-Bick, chairman of the Grenfell Tower Inquiry, today.", "authors": ["Xantha Leatham For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/01/20262502-0-image-a-56_1572225544557.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
