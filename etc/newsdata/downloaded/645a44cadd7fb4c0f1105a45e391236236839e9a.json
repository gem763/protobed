Now, the editorial board of metro Kansas City\u2019s largest newspaper is telling him to pick a lane.\n\nIn an opinion article published Friday, Kansas City Star staff said Pompeo \u201cshould by all means focus on U.S. diplomacy\u201d if he\u2019s genuinely uninterested in pursuing a campaign, \u201cand stop hanging out here every chance he gets.\u201d\n\nPompeo, a former Kansas congressman, made his latest visit to the state on Thursday, traveling to Wichita with Ivanka Trump. While there, they toured WSU Tech and met with its students for a roundtable talk. Meanwhile in Washington, House Democrats are moving full steam ahead with an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, and in Syria, American-allied Kurdish forces fighting ISIS are suffering the fallout of the sudden departure of U.S. troops.\n\nWhen Pompeo sat down with the Star and The Wichita Eagle the day of his trip, an Eagle reporter wondered whether he was using his time wisely. The secretary of state said he was \u201cabsolutely\u201d sure of it.\n\nThough he has repeatedly popped up in the state, Pompeo has said that he does not plan to run for Senate, telling the Eagle there has been \u201cno change\u201d in his position.\n\nOffering up another idea as to why Pompeo took off to Kansas yet again, the Star\u2019s editorial board recited a list of his ongoing challenges at home and abroad.\n\n\u201cWith the Kurds betrayed, ethnic cleansing made possible, Russia rewarded along with Iran and even ISIS, foreign service agents beside themselves, and a shadow foreign policy team on Ukraine apparently headed by [Trump attorney] Rudy Giuliani, well no wonder you\u2019d rather be in Wichita with Ivanka Trump, cheering on \u2018the great work this administration is doing to ensure that our workforce is prepared to compete all around the world,\u2019\u201d the board wrote, quoting from his recent interview.\n\nIn case Pompeo is seeking a Senate run, the board advised him that \u201cKansans are interested in the world beyond the Great Plains\u201d and \u201cwould frown on even a fellow Kansan using his government office to fund what looks increasingly like campaign travel.\u201d\n\nIn July, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) urged Pompeo to consider running for retiring Republican Sen. Pat Roberts\u2019 seat, telling reporters that it was still \u201cthe early stages\u201d because the filing deadline isn\u2019t until June of next year.\n\nHowever, later that month, Pompeo told the Economic Club of Washington that the option was \u201coff the table.\u201d\n\nCLARIFICATION: A previous version of this story suggested the Star was based in Kansas, even though it is based in Kansas City, Missouri. However, it serves the Kansas City metro area, which includes portions of Kansas.", "description": "The Kansas City Star\u2019s editorial board told the secretary of state to do his job or pick a new one.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db486bc200000cc27506de5.jpeg?cache=twyk3m918o&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
