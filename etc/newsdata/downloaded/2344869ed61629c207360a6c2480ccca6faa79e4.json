Odette\n\nWhen chef Joel Robuchon closed his Sentosa restaurant last year, Singapore was left without a three-Michelin-star establishment.\n\nRead also: Joel Robuchon dead at 73 \u2013 he was the world\u2019s most Michelin-starred chef and mentored Gordon Ramsay\n\nThis year, however, there\u2019s a bumper crop of two: French restaurants Les Amis and Odette, the Michelin Guide announced on Tuesday (Sept 17).\n\nBoth restaurants scored two Michelin stars last year.\n\nThis is the largest number of three-starred restaurants in Singapore since the Michelin Guide was established here in 2016.\n\nMichelin said that both restaurants had outstanding cuisine, the ability to evaluate and promote exceptional tables, and a \u201cdeep respect for the terroir and its products\u201d.\n\nThe French word refers to the unique taste that a region\u2019s soil, climate and sunlight give its wine.\n\nOdette \u2013 which is named after head chef Julien Royer\u2019s grandmother \u2013 boasts a \u201cdiscreet and intimate setting as elegant as the setting of the plates,\u201d Michelin said.\n\nIt added that the food featured international flavors, subtle Asian touches and highly-mastered French techniques. Opened in 2015 and currently located in the National Gallery Singapore, the restaurant also snagged the title of Asia\u2019s best restaurant earlier in March.\n\nChef Royer said the three-star rating was \u201cbeyond incredible\u201d, given that the restaurant was barely four years old. \u201cWe\u2019re truly humbled. This accolade is of course a celebration of the people behind Odette and deeply appreciated as affirmation of our hard work,\u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, the French-inspired contemporary cuisine from Les Amis \u2013 which opened in 1994 \u2013 paid \u201cimpressive attention to the smallest detail\u201d and elevated its high-quality produce.\n\nIts wine list of over 3,000 references was considered \u201cone of the most dazzling in the Asian continent\u201d, Michelin added.\n\nMichelin Guide International Director Gwendal Poullennec said that the two restaurants would \u201cclearly position\u201d Singapore as a gastronomic destination.\n\n\u201cGetting a three-star is always a singular moment in a chef\u2019s life, and I am convinced that\u2019s the same feeling for a city or a country,\u201d she added.\n\nThis year\u2019s list also featured five two-Michelin star restaurants and 37 one-star restaurants, including two hawker stalls: Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle and Hawker Chan Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle.\n\nHere\u2019s all the restaurants on the list:\n\nThree Michelin stars: Odette Les Amis Two Michelin stars: Saint Pierre Shisen Hanten Shoukouwa Waku Ghin Z\u00e9n One Michelin star: Alma Basque Kitchen by Aitor B\u00e9ni Braci Buona Terra Burnt Ends Candlenut Cheek Bistro Chef Kang\u2019s Corner House Cut Garibaldi Hawker Chan Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle Iggy\u2019s Imperial Treasure Fine Teochew Cuisine (Orchard) Jaan by Kirk Westaway Jag Jiang-Nan Chun Labyrinth Lei Garden Lerouy Ma Cuisine Meta Nouri Putien (Kitchener Road) Rhubarb Shinji (Bras Basah Road) Shinji (Tanglin Road) Summer Palace Summer Pavilion Sushi Ichi Sushi Kimura Table65 Terra The Song of Indi Vianney Massot\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - Time to save up!.
