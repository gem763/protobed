No matter how difficult, residents rallied and started conserving water. This obviously led to the CoCT not meeting their budgeted target as less water was sold. Next, the same residents were hit with severe water tariff increases to balance the CoCT budget.\n\nAfter good rains and the current level of the dams, the time has come for the CoCT to speak out on the following:\n\nWhen will the severe water tariffs be lowered to benefit the citizens that is keeping the DA in power and paying their salaries? When can the citizens of the Western Cape expect to see a workable plan of how the DA intend to proceed with future water storage projects?\n\nUnless these points aren\u2019t addressed and put into operation soon, the DA might as well except that they will lose a lot more support at the next elections, if not control of the Western Cape.\n\nThe bottom-line is that the DA must be transparent as far as all projects are concerned and assign priorities accordingly. Example, water is more important than many of the current projects in the pipeline, in fact it should be the DA's top priority.\n\nPublish a comprehensive list quarterly of all the current and planned projects and the current status on progress, the citizens can then interact and assist you in your decision-making plans.\n\nIf all else fails, then the citizens must consider forming a pressure group to take the DA to task.\n\nBob du Preez\n\nCape Town", "description": "When the drought set in, all citizens were requested to conserve water.
