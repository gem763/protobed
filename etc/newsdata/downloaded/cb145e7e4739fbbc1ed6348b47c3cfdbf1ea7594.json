It worked only when a website's graphics had \"alt-text,\" a description of the image that appeared on the screen when a cursor floated over it.\n\nWithout it, Robles said he was unable to order a customized pizza or use discounts offered exclusively online. Domino's argued the law applied to its store but not its website.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThe ADA \"does not demand full accessibility for each and every means of accessing the goods or services a public accommodation provides to the public,\" the company argued in its appeal. What matters was the \"combined means of access to those goods or services,\" executives said.\n\nTrade groups said they've seen an increase in lawsuits alleging websites were not ADA-compliant.", "description": "The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected an appeal from Domino's Pizza, clearing the way for a lawsuit filed by a blind man alleging the chain's website and mobile-phone app are not accessible to people with disabilities.", "authors": ["Louis Casiano"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Dominos-Pizza.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
