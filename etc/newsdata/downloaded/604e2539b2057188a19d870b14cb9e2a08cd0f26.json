Pretty cool huh.'\n\nHe added: 'Thank you Mark, for sending me the pic and for your understanding and compassion for the animals that we share our beautiful country with.\n\n'Zoom in to the ground on the right of the kids.\n\n'Please be careful, take care this Summer, and be nice to snakes'.", "description": "The brother and sister were playing together under blue skies near their house in Eskdale, north east Victoria.
