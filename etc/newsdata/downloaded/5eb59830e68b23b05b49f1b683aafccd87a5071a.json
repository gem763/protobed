That means Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will need to work with other parties to pass his proposals.\n\nThe Liberals are likely to look for support from the New Democratic Party, which took 24 seats. While they have different positions on issues like energy and trade, the Liberal and NDP platforms overlap significantly on the innovation economy.\n\nFrom immigration and skills development to Big Tech, here\u2019s how some of the key files that matter to startups and fast-growing firms might play out under this minority government.\n\nThe big picture\n\nTo some degree, the Liberals are likely to try to pick up where they left off. Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains was re-elected, though it\u2019s unclear whether he will retain his portfolio.\n\nHowever, both Jim Balsillie, former co-CEO of Research in Motion (now BlackBerry) and chair of scale-up lobby group the Council of Canadian Innovators, and Nobina Robinson, a senior fellow at the C.D. Howe Institute think tank, told The Logic they felt none of the parties paid much attention to innovation during the campaign.\n\nRobinson said the government isn\u2019t likely to move forward with implementation of new ideas on innovation and skills until the next budget. In a minority situation, that document \u201cwill be subject to a lot of negotiation on other issues,\u201d she said, citing climate action and a national pharmacare plan as key priorities. Both were among the six \u201curgent priorities\u201d NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said he would make part of any discussions about propping up a minority government.\n\nAs for the Liberals\u2019 accomplishments to date, over the last two years they have created policies to encourage IP generation, as well as a digital charter of high-level principles like personal control over data and data portability. But Balsillie said they still need to implement national data and IP strategies. \u201cThey talk about it from a consumer point of view and a security point of view, but they don\u2019t talk about it from a prosperity point of view,\u201d said Balsillie. \u201cAnd it\u2019s become the new factor of production to drive economies.\u201d He cited a Public Policy Forum study that found that while \u201cintangibles\u201d like IP and data account for an increasing share of global economic output and growth, Canada lags behind countries like the U.S., U.K. and France.\n\nTaxation\n\nThe Liberal and NDP proposal Both parties promised a three per cent value-added tax on the targeted-ad sales and digital-service revenues of firms with at least $1 billion in worldwide and more than $40 million in Canadian revenue.\n\nThe Liberal platform counts on revenue from the measure beginning in the 2020\u20132021 fiscal year, meaning it would likely need to be implemented via a fall economic update or next year\u2019s budget. The parliamentary budget officer, the fiscal watchdog agency, estimated it will bring in $540 million in the first year, rising to $1.2 billion in 2028\u20132029.\n\nBalsillie welcomed the measure as a way to pay for other government programs.\n\nBut he said the tax does nothing to address \u201cmuch more fundamental complaints\u201d about foreign tech giants\u2019 presence in Canada, like their use of the scientific research and experimental development tax credit, their creation of intellectual property via researchers at public universities and the added competition they create for local talent.\n\nThe Liberals have promised their levy will be an interim measure until there\u2019s an international consensus on OECD-led changes to the global corporate taxation system, which will attempt to prevent large multinational companies from reducing their tax bills by moving profits and assets to other countries.\n\nSome Canadian scale-up executives favour the OECD approach. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we want to target Facebook and Amazon,\u201d said Sachin Aggarwal, CEO of Think Research, a Toronto-based health-care technology firm. Affected firms \u201cwill have to spend more money in Canada, to reduce their taxes payable,\u201d he noted, which could further increase competition for skilled talent.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether the NDP would support the Liberal proposal. Canada \u201cneeds more fundamental reforms,\u201d said M\u00e9lanie Richer, NDP director of communications and media, citing her party\u2019s proposal to require parties to \u201cprove the economic substance of offshore transactions.\u201d\n\nSingh is also seeking a \u201ccommitment to close tax loopholes.\u201d The NDP promised to eliminate the lower stock-options tax rate for \u201cbig companies,\u201d although Richer said the party recognized that the deduction helps \u201cstart-ups and growing businesses attract talent.\u201d The current Liberal government has already imposed a $200,000 cap for options issued after Jan. 1, 2020.\n\nAggarwal said tech firms are concerned about new taxes on stock options. A reasonable approach would involve a \u201cnumber that\u2019s into the millions before you get taxed,\u201d he said, and provisions to allow payers to carry forward what they owe, since private companies\u2019 shares can\u2019t easily be sold \u2014 even when their values rise on paper.\n\nImmigration\n\nThe Liberal proposal A municipal nominee program with at least 5,000 annual spaces for local governments, chambers of commerce and labour councils to sponsor new immigrants.\n\nThe Liberals launched the Global Skills Strategy in June 2017, a major change to the immigration system. The program offers faster application-processing, as well as a new stream for highly-skilled tech workers, following years of businesses saying the existing system was too slow.\n\n\u201cThe tech community thinks it\u2019s been a huge success,\u201d said Aggarwal, whose company has hired people via the program.\n\nKareem El-Assal, director of policy and digital strategy at CanadaVisa, said the new municipal nominee program would help address another significant concern with Canada\u2019s immigration system. \u201cIn seven out of 10 provinces in Canada, you have 80 per cent of all newcomers going to (the) largest city,\u201d he said. (The exceptions are New Brunswick, Saskatchewan and Alberta.)\n\nEl-Assal said he expects the federal government will task select municipal governments \u2014 alongside chambers of commerce and employers \u2014 with identifying local needs, choosing immigration candidates, offering them jobs and working to settle them.\n\nLabour needs vary across the country, El-Assal noted. \u201cTalk to employers in Ottawa and Toronto; they\u2019re dying for tech talent \u2014 they want engineers and marketers and other folks within their field,\u201d he said. Atlantic Canada\u2019s aging population needs health-care workers, while Whistler, B.C.\u2019s hospitality sector needs staff. The program could therefore give local innovation clusters in smaller markets a new way to attract talent.\n\nEl-Assal doesn\u2019t expect other parties to force the Liberal minority government to make major immigration policy changes. \u201cMaybe the NDP asks for the government to take more of a humanitarian bent,\u201d he said. Its platform states, \u201cFamily reunification should be a priority.\u201d\n\nSkills and education\n\nThe Liberal proposal To move forward with the Canada Training Benefit, an annual tax credit and employment insurance (EI) payout announced in the 2019 federal budget for workers who take time off for education. The party also promised to move forward with reductions in interest rates on federal student loans and increase grants.\n\nRobinson doesn\u2019t expect the NDP to oppose the Canada Training Benefit, but she questioned how it will be implemented \u2014 how the government will determine if recipients have actually done training, for example, and how it will affect federal-provincial agreements on employment programs.\n\nThe NDP platform promised to allow workers in unspecified sectors and parts of the country to go through EI-funded training \u201cin advance of losing a job.\u201d It also proposed a new Workers Development and Opportunities Fund for workers from marginalized backgrounds and in transitioning sectors.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some benefit, especially in the short term, to meet a need of a particular industry (with training),\u201d said Valerie Walker, executive director of the Business/Higher Education Roundtable and co-chair of the federal Future Skills Council. But she noted that businesses have ranked soft skills \u2014 not industry-specific abilities \u2014 like communication and critical thinking as the top abilities for which they\u2019re looking in both entry- and mid-level hires.\n\nRobinson predicted the Liberals, NDP and Greens will be able to agree on helping students with post-secondary education debt. Waiving interest on student loans is one of Singh\u2019s six \u201curgent priorities.\u201d Robinson said the Liberals\u2019 targeted policies make more sense than the Greens\u2019 universal loan-forgiveness proposal, \u201cso that the government doesn\u2019t subsidize people that don\u2019t need it.\u201d\n\nThe government also needs to review the amount of money it gives provinces for higher education, she said. Provincial governments largely handle post-secondary policy, but their self-generated funding to those institutions has been falling, according to an analysis from Higher Education Strategy Associates.\n\nTelecommunications\n\nThe Liberal proposal Reduce monthly cellphone and wireless bills by 25 per cent in the next two years.\n\nTrudeau campaigned on encouraging telecommunications firms to cut prices, and introducing more competition to the market if they are unable to meet the party\u2019s target.\n\nReducing cellphone bills is another of the NDP\u2019s six priorities. They proposed a price cap on wireless and broadband plans based on what customers in other OECD countries pay. Carriers are opposed. \u201c(Price caps) stifle innovation and discourage investment in the expansion and upgrading of wireless infrastructure,\u201d Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association spokesperson Greg Burch recently toldThe Logic.\n\nThe Logic", "description": "From immigration and skills development to Big Tech, here\u2019s how some of the key files that matter to startups might play out", "authors": ["Murad Hemmadi"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/trudeau-innovation.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
