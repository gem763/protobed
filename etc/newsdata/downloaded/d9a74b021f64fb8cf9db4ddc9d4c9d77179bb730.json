It was really upsetting.\n\n'Coleen knows it's a problem that can be fixed but it's still been massively stressful.'\n\nMailOnline has contacted Wayne and Coleen Rooney's representatives for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, the Rooney family are in a dispute over the new home, with residents in the village near Knutsford comparing it to a large supermarket, dubbing it the 'Morrison's Mansion'.\n\nThe sportsman is set to move into the six-bed mansion later this month alongside his four children, but locals have also said the manor is was bigger than expected when it was first revealed.\n\nFormer England football star Wayne Rooney's \u00a320million mansion has reportedly been flooded after the recent bout of stormy weather\n\nLocals are also opposed to supplementary plans to build a large shed to store a tractor and hay bales.\n\nThe property will boast an orangery, bar, TV room, snooker room, cinema and wine cellar, as well as a huge indoor swimming pool surrounded by a glass pavilion, a hot tub, steam room and 'his' and 'hers' changing rooms.\n\nThe ex-Premier League star's pad boasts an extensive patio, landscaped gardens, a luxury car garage and a stable block.\n\nIt also has a 'guest toilet' and separate lifts - one for the family, the other for visitors to avoid the social faux pas of using the couple's own downstairs loo.\n\nThe couple are due to live in the sprawling home after moving back to the UK following his short stint playing for DC United in Washington, with the striker set to return to British football with Derby County in January.\n\nThe footballer was caught up in several controversies while in the States, including being charged with intoxication and profanity in public in December.\n\nPeople who live in the small village near Knutsford have now said the home, which had previously been described as looking like a Morrisons supermarket (shown is the stables building), was bigger than expected when it was first revealed\n\nIn August, he was spotted in a hotel lobby with a mystery woman after seven hours of partying in Vancouver, Canada, with a source telling The Sun that Coleen had 'read him the riot act'.
