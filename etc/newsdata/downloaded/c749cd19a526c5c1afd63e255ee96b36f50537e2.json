The team has four women's World Cup titles, more than any other nation.\n\nPlayers from the U.S. men's squad threw their support behind their female counterparts in July and accused U.S. Soccer of not paying a fair share of generated revenue to national team players.\n\nThe dispute has attracted international attention, with numerous celebrities, athletes and politicians backing the women's players amid renewed conversation over pay equity in the United States.\n\n(Reporting by Amy Tennery; Editing by Tom Brown)", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. women's national soccer team players pushed back in a court filing on Monday against claims by the U.S. Soccer Federation that some members earn more than their male counterparts, as they argued for class action status in the latest chapter of their closely-watched legal fight.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
