You have to think about these things. If you have a fixture list where one team cannot be part of all the games, then you have to think about the fixture list.\n\n\u2018Hopefully it starts now. I really think that\u2019s fair, and this problem is obvious now. We will not be the victim of this problem.\n\n\u2018We play tonight, we wanted to win it, we did that, and if they don\u2019t find a proper date for us, then we cannot play the next round and whoever is our opponent will go through. Or Arsenal play them.\u2019\n\nMORE: Jamie Carragher tells Arsenal to sell Shkodran Mustafi after Liverpool defeat\n\nMORE: Chelsea 1-2 Manchester United: Marcus Rashford\u2019s stunning free-kick sends Blues crashing out of Carabao Cup", "description": "Jurgen Klopp has sensationally threatened to pull his Liverpool team from the Carabao Cup if an appropriate date is not found for their quarter-final tie.", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1179076129_1572475818.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
