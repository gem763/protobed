Our expectation is that this government upholds that commitment and if they ask for changes, like any other country, the IMF will look at their request as part of what their economic plan is,\" Mnuchin said on the sidelines of the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh.\n\n\"We want to see the people of Argentina, and the economy, succeed. Our interests are to support the people,\" Mnuchin added.\n\nMnuchin signed off on an initial $50 billion Argentina program in June 2018, along with an expansion to $57 billion three months later. It is by far the largest bailout in the IMF's 75-year history, with about $43 billion already disbursed.\n\nHe said it was too soon for the United States to weigh in on any decision by the IMF as to how to proceed with Argentina.\n\nThe IMF has said that is ready to work with Argentina to make the program viable and help put the country back on a path to economic growth.", "description": "U.S. expects Argentina to uphold commitment to IMF: Mnuchin", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9T22H_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
