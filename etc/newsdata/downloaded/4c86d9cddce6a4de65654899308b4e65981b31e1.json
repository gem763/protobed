The small US military presence in Syria is not sustainable forever. Still, US officials argued it\u2019s necessary to fight Isis, protect our Kurdish partners and carve out a safe place for civilians amid the ongoing Syrian disaster. If the SDF-liberated areas could be stabilized, it was hoped, the US presence might provide leverage to try to end the war diplomatically. Whether one supports the mission or wants to wash America\u2019s hands of the Middle East, this is a tough call.\n\nBut none of this complexity matters because Trump can\u2019t make a coherent policy decision. Rather than craft a withdrawal plan, Trump made the decision on a whim after a call with Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, leaving American allies and interests out to dry.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Kurdish partners are in danger. The SDF have led the fight against Isis and suffered 11,000 killed. But without US help, the Kurds now face a deadly onslaught from both Turkey and a resurgent Isis. When they learned about Trump\u2019s policy reversal, some reportedly called Americans \u201ctraitors\u201d.\n\nThe fight against Isis will be crippled. Despite Trump\u2019s claims, Isis continues its insurgency. The SDF was the heart of the strategy to keep the pressure on Isis, leading raids, manning checkpoints and stabilizing liberated areas. The Kurds will now be forced to defend against a Turkish attack, and Isis will exploit the opening to regroup. More immediately, the Kurds are holding thousands of Isis fighters because no one else would take responsibility. These fighters may escape or be released if the Kurds are forced to flee a Turkish offensive.\n\nAmerica\u2019s closest allies were caught completely by surprise. Trump didn\u2019t warn the UK or France, even though both countries also have troops on the ground.\n\nThis move will also further confuse US policy towards Turkey. While Turkey is a Nato ally, it has become more authoritarian under Erdo\u011fan, and the US-Turkey alliance is on the rocks. But the US can\u2019t pick a policy: it is threatening to sanction Turkey for buying Russian military equipment; but Trump gave Turkey the green light to massacre US partners; after announcing his Syria decision, Trump tweeted that if Turkey does anything \u201coff limits\u201d, Trump would \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey \u2026\u201d, which was followed by praise of Turkey and an invitation to Washington for Erdo\u011fan.\n\nRussia and Syria are the real winners. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has long supported Syria\u2019s President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s brutal war, intentionally targeting civilians, schools and hospitals. The Syrian regime will now have even more of a free hand to seek its retribution, and Russia will reap the benefits. Trump has a knack for making decisions that help Russia and hurt the US.\n\n\n\nThe decision was not even coordinated within the US government. The secretary of defense quickly came out with a statement \u2013 which was later deleted \u2013 trying to walk back Trump\u2019s statement that Turkey could start an operation against the Kurds. And the immediate reaction on the ground in Syria appeared to be confusion. The US \u2013 again, under Trump \u2013 looks incompetent.\n\nAnd yet, none of this is surprising. Trump doesn\u2019t make policy decisions considering normal interests like those above \u2013 he has impulses that steer the most powerful country the world has ever known.\n\nTrump\u2019s foreign policy has been so disastrous that the House of Representatives is in the midst of an impeachment inquiry over the fact that the president attempted to extort a foreign power \u2013 Ukraine \u2013 to fabricate smears against Trump\u2019s domestic political rival. Trump then also publicly asked China \u2013 which is supposed to be America\u2019s greatest geopolitical rival \u2013 to help create a scandal for Trump\u2019s opponent.\n\nDespite all of this, removing the US military presence at some point might actually be the right call. But not like this, and not with these consequences\n\nSo what caused this particular disaster? Was it Trump\u2019s self-admitted conflict of interest with Turkey? Perhaps Erdo\u011fan offered to make up dirt on Trump\u2019s opponents? Maybe Trump asked him to? Or maybe it was simply what a National Security Council source told Newsweek: \u201cPresident Trump was definitely out-negotiated.\u201d\n\nDespite all of this, removing the US military presence at some point might actually be the right call. But not like this, and not with these consequences.\n\nPerhaps the most outrageous aspect of this episode is watching Trump supporters in Congress express anger about the move at the same moment they defend Trump\u2019s abuse of power in trying to extort a foreign government to help Trump\u2019s campaign. His congressional supporters try to act as though they care about national security by beating their chests over their willingness to keep American troops fighting abroad, but their hypocrisy makes clear they only speak out when they think it won\u2019t hurt them politically.\n\nThis is American foreign policy under Trump. Every day is a new catastrophe, but the same story \u2013 a self-absorbed president who makes policy by whim and abuses his power to advance his personal interests while sacrificing those of America and its friends. And too few of America\u2019s leaders in positions to stop Trump are willing to do what\u2019s right. So Trump will continue to make more decisions like the Syria one, continue to ask more countries to help his political interests and continue to undermine national security \u2013 until Congress acts to hold him accountable.", "description": "The president took a complicated issue and made it dramatically worse by acting on impulse \u2013 making the US again look incompetent and unreliable", "authors": ["Michael H Fuchs"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09cae5ace94a9159ec310956d3c3a1769c2bb13b/0_49_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2230331972cb63dca49fb6f2bfb71042", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
