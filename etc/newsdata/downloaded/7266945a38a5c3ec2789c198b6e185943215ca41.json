Since Trump took office, both have also reportedly seen an uptick in business from the U.S. military and its service members.\n\nThis previously unreported line of inquiry widens the scope of congressional investigation into the Trump administration\u2019s potential violations of the Constitution\u2019s Emoluments Clause, which forbids presidents from using their office to enrich themselves.\n\nIn a June 21 letter to acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) and Rep. Jaime Raskin (D-Md.) asked the Pentagon to turn over documentation surrounding military stops at Glasgow Prestwick Airport and Trump Turnberry. The investigation began back in April, according to Politico, which obtained the letter.\n\nYet the Pentagon has so far refused to cooperate, an unnamed senior aide on the oversight committee told Politico, prompting the committee to consider other options.\n\nFrom October 2017 through June, the military has placed 629 orders for refueling at Prestwick Airport, Cummings and Raskin wrote. The fuel, which could potentially have been supplied by a U.S. military base, cost $11 million.\n\nTurnberry also provided \u201ccut-price rooms for select passengers and crew\u201d along with free rounds of golf, the representatives said in their letter.\n\nThe property, which Trump purchased in 2014, has reportedly failed to turn a profit. The nearby airport, viewed as a necessary pipeline for Turnberry visitors, has operated at a loss for years and is currently up for sale by the Scottish government.\n\nTrump and Vice President Mike Pence faced a storm of criticism this week amid Pence\u2019s stay at Trump\u2019s Irish golf resort during a visit to speak with Irish leaders. The resort was 180 miles away from the vice president\u2019s meetings \u2015 on the opposite side of the island nation.\n\nOn Friday, the oversight committee announced that it would investigate Pence\u2019s stay. At the same time, the House Judiciary Committee said it would look into the president\u2019s suggestion that next year\u2019s G7 summit be held at his Miami resort.", "description": "Congress is already looking into various ways the Trump administration has sought to direct business to the president's properties.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d73e25a3b0000b97ad0c17b.jpeg?cache=7a5qkryurf&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
