Now the 37-year-old is using her platform to promote the benefits of exercise in pregnancy and the problems post-partum that need to be discussed. Here is her story.\n\nThere is no real modesty in ultra marathons. People pee to the side of the road so I wasn\u2019t worried about getting my boobs out. The UTMB is an ultra-marathon but it\u2019s a lot of walking and you\u2019re climbing every 10,000m. During the race, I was pulling my T-shirt and sports bra up and expressing behind trees, down toilets in the aid station \u2013 just basically anywhere that I could because my breasts were so painful.\n\nThe first time I could breastfeed was 16 hours in and I was in agony because I couldn\u2019t hand express enough during the race. My husband wasn\u2019t able to get my three-month old son Cormac to me sooner as you are not allowed to meet your crew during the race. There are only about six or seven points where you can meet your support. If you meet them outside of that, you are disqualified. Although I was pregnant when I got my UTMB place, I couldn\u2019t defer it because the rules say you can only defer for injury, not pregnancy. I didn\u2019t want to risk getting disqualified for breastfeeding.\n\nNo one cared that I was breastfeeding, but a photographer asked my husband if he could take a picture. I was pumping and feeding at an aid station, and trying to juggle everything when Alexis Berg, a photographer for the Strava social fitness network, spoke to my husband about taking the photograph. If you could have expanded the shot you would have seen that my friend Matt is changing the batteries in my head torch and repacking my bag with more food and my husband is trying to feed me an avocado sandwich. I thought that it might get the organisers to change the policies of the race if they saw the picture and they would do referrals for pregnant women.", "description": "An image of ultra-marathon runner Sophie Power breastfeeding her baby at an aid station of the 106-mile Ultra-Trail du Mont Blanc (UTMB) went viral last year.", "authors": ["Sophie Power", "Becky Downie"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/womens-sport/2019/10/16/212441049-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqF4WwDpbO-CkdHTTCi9TWzk2jwtsr_PtG2kcFAYzAZgA.png?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
