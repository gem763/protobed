We hope the union will look positively at these decisions,\u201d Razzaz said, saying that the hikes would take effect at the start of next month.\n\nThe union, however, rejected the measure and criticized the prime minister.\n\n\u201cYou are imposing a solution from one side. This is an authoritarian method,\u201d Nasser Al Nawasrah, deputy head of the Jordanian Teachers Syndicate, said in a statement. \u201cWe donate these bread crumbs to the government.\u201d\n\nThe government, which used tear gas to disperse protesting teachers at the start of the strike, says the union\u2019s demands would add to fiscal woes while the country grapples to curb record public debt of around $40 billion. The debt is due at least in part to successive governments\u2019 adopting an expansionist fiscal policy characterized by job creation in the public sector.\n\nOfficials say Jordan can no longer afford to sustain a public sector whose salaries eat up the central government\u2019s $13 billion budget in a country with some of the world\u2019s highest government spending relative to its economy.\n\nStrike leaders and the government who met on Saturday in the latest round of talks were in emergency session to discuss the government\u2019s first pay offer in a deepening crisis.\n\nThe strike has turned in many of the country\u2019s rural areas and smaller cities that are a traditional heartland of support for the government as a protest against successive governments\u2019 failure to deliver on promises of economic growth.\n\nThe government has accused the teachers union of intransigence and of forcing its hand at a time when it says the economy faces a downturn and state finances are stretched.\n\nSome officials have also accused union leaders of harbouring the Islamist opposition\u2019s political agenda, a charge which the teachers union denies and says was part of a government smear campaign.\n\nThe government fears new pay demands by public sector employees, including doctors, and pension hikes to army retirees would wreck efforts to restore fiscal prudence for a sustained recovery.\n\nJordan\u2019s King Abdullah ordered the army chief of staff on Saturday to approve a pension rise for some army retirees that would cost another 25 million dinars ($35 million) as a first stage, state media said.", "description": "Jordan's cabinet on Saturday offered striking teachers pay hikes in a bid to end a damaging nationwide strike that has piled pressure on the debt-burdened country undergoing tough IMF-backed fiscal reforms amid concerns of a new round of demands by army retirees and other public-sector employees.", "authors": ["Suleiman Al-Khalidi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
