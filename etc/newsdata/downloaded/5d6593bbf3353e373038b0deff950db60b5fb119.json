Here is what Solomon, who has just joined Fox News as a contributor, told Hannity:\n\nI can confirm to you tonight that the Ukrainian government was planning to reopen the Burisma investigation. This was long before the President ever imagined having a call with President Zelensky. In fact, it was before President Zelensky was even elected. This is a significant shift in the factual timeline. This is information that was omitted from the whistleblower\u2019s complaint. Let me tell you what we learned today. The U.S. government had open source intelligence and was aware that NABU [National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine], an FBI-like agency in Ukraine that fights corruption \u2013 in fact, it was started by Joe Biden \u2013 that it had reopened an investigation into Burisma, its owner Zlochevsky and unusual transactions in the Burisma accounts in February 2019. On March 28, 2019, the Prosecutor General\u2019s office agreed to that request to open an investigation and they filed a 15-page notice of suspicion alleging that there may be illicit funds that were running through Burisma from 2010 all the way through 2015, that\u2019s important, because Hunter Biden\u2019s on the board for two of those years, 2014-2015. And specifically, that notice of suspicion said they were looking at the possibility that the $3.4 million paid to Hunter Biden\u2019s firm may have been part of the illicit funds that were moving through the company. A month later, in April, the Prosecutor\u2019s Office, open source intelligence again, the U.S. government officials confirming they were aware of this request of another investigative agency in Ukraine for assistance in going through these bank records. That is a significant change in the timeline. It was omitted from the whistleblower\u2019s complaint and the question is, did he not know it or did he exclude it because it didn\u2019t fit the narrative he was trying to write. That\u2019s a question for Congress to answer. \u2026 There\u2019s another oddity that comes out of the records. If you can put that back up on the screen. These are bank records from Hunter Biden\u2019s firm. Hunter Biden and Joe Biden keeps saying he was getting $50,000 a month. There\u2019s only one thing wrong with that. The FBI raided Devon Archer\u2019s office and his bank records, in an unrelated case in 2016, they show transfers of $166,000 a month and as high as $220,000 in one month going into Hunter Biden\u2019s and Devon Archer\u2019s firm. That\u2019s a lot more than $50,000 and it was one of those things that piqued the Ukrainian prosecutor\u2019s interest into reopening the case in March of 2019. The size of the money was much larger than Hunter Biden and Joe Biden has been saying.\n\nThis blows up the Democrats most recent attempt to take down the President. It is just the latest in a series of facts that belie the bogus narrative they\u2019ve spent the last three weeks promoting. At this point, it has to be dawning on, at the very least independent voters, and maybe even some moderate Democrats that House leadership is engaged in a corrupt, vicious, high stakes effort to frame the President.\n\nWhat more is there to say?\n\nWatch the video.
