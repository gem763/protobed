Photographer: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg (Qilai Shen/Bloomberg)\n\nA report released Sunday by China Labor Watch, a nonprofit advocacy group, accused Apple and its manufacturing partner Foxconn of a litany of labor violations, from withholding bonus payments to rolling back safety training to employing more temporary workers than China\u2019s laws allow.\n\nThe report was based on observations and documents gathered by undercover investigators working at China\u2019s biggest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou. The group said one of the investigators was employed by Apple for four years.\n\nApple spokeswoman Lori Lodes denied most of the allegations, but acknowledged that Apple did exceed the number of contract workers allowed by Chinese law, which caps the ratio at 10 percent. Contract workers are paid attractive overtime wages, but don\u2019t receive the benefits of full time workers. \u201cWe have confirmed all workers are being compensated appropriately, including any overtime wages and bonuses, all overtime work was voluntary and there was no evidence of forced labor,\u201d Lodes said.\n\nFoxconn acknowledged a larger than allowed percentage of temporary workers in its factories but denied other allegations. \u201cA recent review of our operations at our facility in Zhengzhou did identify some workforce compliance issues,\u201d wrote Allanjit Singh, a spokesman for Foxconn, in an emailed statement. He denied other allegations like forced labor or withholding bonuses from workers. \u201cOur work to address the issues identified in our Zhengzhou facility continues and we will closely monitor the situation,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe report accused Apple of exploiting Chinese workers in part to absorb costs associated with tariffs placed on its products. \u201cApple is now transferring costs from the trade war through their suppliers to workers and profiting from the exploitation of Chinese Workers,\u201d the report reads.\n\nThe report alleged that Apple\u2019s manufacturer, Foxconn, uses outsourcing firms, known as \u201cdispatch companies,\u201d to meet seasonal fluctuations in demand. For instance, new iPhone models require huge surges in labor to meet demand.\n\nApple is expected to announce the newest version of its iPhone on Tuesday, as it does every fall. Though Apple has seen slowing demand for iPhones, it sells millions of its new handsets every quarter. According to Strategy Analytics, Apple sold 16.2 million units of its iPhone XR in the second quarter of 2019. That\u2019s 12 million more than Samsung\u2019s most popular phone model, the Galaxy S10 Plus.\n\nChurning out that many units with consistency and profitability is perhaps Apple\u2019s greatest trick. But China Labor Watch accused Apple of cutting corners to do it. \u201cMultinational corporations helped drive economic development in China but they have also exploited loopholes in Chinese labor laws,\u201d the report says.\n\nThe nonprofit said it has been investigating Apple\u2019s manufacturing practices for a decade and has received worker complaints ranging from exposure to toxic chemicals to verbal abuse to forced labor.\n\nThe release of the report was first covered by Bloomberg.\n\nApple has been criticized for the working conditions in its factories in the past and has responded with an annual review of the treatment of workers in its factories, which it releases in a supplier responsibility report.\n\nThe report placed some of the blame on the Chinese government for turning a blind eye to labor violations. It urged Apple CEO Tim Cook to put pressure on suppliers to adhere to Chinese labor laws, regardless of whether they\u2019re enforced.", "description": "Apple denied most of the allegations, but acknowledged that it exceeded the number of contract workers allowed by Chinese law.", "authors": ["Reed Albergotti", "Reporter Covering Consumer Electronics", "September At Am", "Reed Albergotti Is The Washington Post'S Consumer Electronics Reporter", "Taking Readers Inside Powerful", "Secretive Companies Such As Apple", "Shedding Light On The Murky", "Global Industry Responsible For Building The Myriad Devices That Touch Every Aspect Of Our Lives.
