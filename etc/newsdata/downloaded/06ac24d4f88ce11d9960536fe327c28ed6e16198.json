I just think of the rhythm, the background music and every lyric in the song to take my mind of my anxiety. I also like to focus on a certain object and describe its features in my head and give a critique on that object. I have been trying to stay off social media as much as possible lately because I feel like that contributes to my anxiety. The first thing I would open when I get anxiety is Instagram, and I feel like social media just makes it worse. When I am alone, I put in my ear buds and feel a whole different world outside of the one I am living. I am able to forget and cope by singing my heart out to the Jonas Brothers and just feel carefree about everything around me.", "description": "\u2018Some people assume that anxiety doesn\u2019t exist in teenagers and that we are overreacting\u2019", "authors": ["Salom\u00e9e Levy"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rVGx6inPn0goBhC-NLM_z8DLweU=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-thelily-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IOGCPBCHOBD3HITVR6FG2AVMTM.jpg"}
