I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever been treated seriously enough because Annalise was a traveller.\n\n\u201cIf she\u2019d been a doctor or lawyer, I\u2019m sure authorities would have treated it seriously from the start and someone would be in jail.\n\n\u201cWe all know there are just two people who know what happened to Annalise \u2013 Jordan and Angela Newlands.\u201d\n\nAnnalise\u2019s body was found with her throat cut in May 2018.\n\n(Image: DailyRecord/WS)\n\nNewlands, who has a host of violent and dishonest convictions, was cleared in May this year of Annalise\u2019s murder due to insufficient evidence.\n\nThe mother of four was then blamed by her partner, Johnstone, for the gruesome killing.\n\nJohnstone, 25, who admitted carrying his dead sister\u2019s body for two miles and dumping her by a roadside, was also cleared of murder after the jury returned a controversial not proven verdict.\n\nHe said Newlands cut his sister\u2019s throat with a Stanley knife and he had remained in a car with Newlands\u2019 sleeping children.\n\nHe said he later carried his sister\u2019s body for about 40 minutes before dumping it behind a wall about two miles away because he feared Newlands\u2019 father was going to \u201cchop my wee sister up and throw her away\u201d.\n\nThe prosecution and defence both agreed Johnstone\u2019s car was near the Maggie Wall memorial at the time Annalise was attacked.\n\nNo murder weapon has ever been found.\n\n(Image: DailyRecord/WS)\n\n(Image: DailyRecord/WS)\n\nA Dunning resident, who asked not to be named, said: \u201cThe police have been back and are scouring the area for something or other.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve tried to keep it low-key but it was clear what it was about. That poor girl had her throat cut and her body was left by the monument to rot.\n\n\"It would be good if they found something to move the case to a successful conclusion.\u201d\n\nA police spokesman said: \u201cWe can confirm that the search activity that was ongoing in the Dunning area, which was in connection with the death of Annalise Johnstone in May 2018, has now been concluded.\u201d\n\nNewlands was recently ordered to carry out 180 hours unpaid work in the community after she admitted trying to hide her identity by giving police a false ID.", "description": "Gordon Johnstone believes a fresh investigation into the death of daughter Annalise Johnstone, 22, in Perthshire will lead nowhere", "authors": ["Gordon Blackstock", "Image", "Dailyrecord Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20658523.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Dads-fury-as-cops-re-open-murder-probe-of-woman-slaughtered-and-dumped-at-witch-momentJordan-Johns.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
