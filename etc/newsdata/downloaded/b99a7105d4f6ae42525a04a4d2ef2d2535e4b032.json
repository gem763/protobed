The aim of his project, Selvaggio adds, is to show that no technology used to catch criminals is \"infallible\".\n\nThese artworks are accepting pervasive surveillance as being inevitable. \u2014 Professor Torin Monahan, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n\nWhile anti-surveillance accessories offer some degree of disguise, many designers warn their creations are tools for social commentary rather than invisibility.\n\nHarvey, for example, acknowledges that his many-faced textile pattern works on a system that was widely used a few years ago but has since been surpassed.\n\n\"It does not work for modern face detection systems that would be used by law enforcement,\" he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnti-facial recognition fashion has also drawn some criticism, with one academic saying it risked \"normalising\" surveillance.\n\n\"These artworks are accepting pervasive surveillance as being inevitable,\" says Torin Monahan, a professor of communication at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dazzle Club walkers in London say camera camouflage is helping people reclaim their identities and hope the initiative will spread to other cities, says Roderick.\n\n\"There's definitely something important about being able to take ownership of our own image and understand when we want to put that out into the public space,\" she says.\n\nThompson Reuters Foundation\n\n\u2014 Reuters", "description": "From sunglasses to face masks, numerous wearable devices promising a veil of anonymity are making their way into the mainstream.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.6248%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_210/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c19aec0dcae1438b578b595b557a8cbf2a197e11", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
