More events will take place before another big day of action September 27.\n\nStudents across the US and beyond are planning to walk out of class to call attention to the issue.\n\nBut everyone is invited to express solidarity and \"disrupt business as usual,\" organizers say.\n\n\"Together, we will sound the alarm and show our politicians that business as usual is no longer an option,\" they say. \"The climate crisis won't wait, so neither will we.\"\n\nWho's organizing the strikes?\n\nThe individual strikes are being organized and executed by young people in their own towns and cities across the world, much like last year's national school walkouts aimed at combating gun violence.\n\nThunberg first garnered international attention by skipping school and staging sit-ins outside the Swedish Parliament. That grew into a movement called Fridays for Future , and now, students all over the world participate.\n\nBut Friday's global climate strikes are meant to include everyone.\n\n\"We feel a lot of adults haven't quite understood that we young people won't hold off the climate crisis ourselves,\" Thunberg and an international group of activists wrote in an invitation announcing the strikes\n\n\"Sorry if this is inconvenient for you,\" they said. \"But this is not a single-generation job. It's humanity's job.\"\n\nWhere are the strikes taking place?\n\nAs of Tuesday, 4,638 events were slated to take place in 139 countries, according to Thunberg\n\nCNN has not independently confirmed that number.\n\nBut the organizers' website shows events set for major cities like New York, Los Angeles, London, Berlin, Moscow and Hong Kong.\n\nGlobal Climate Strike 20-27th of September:\n\n4638 events in 139 countries on all continents.\n\nAnd counting...\n\n\n\nEveryone is welcome.\n\nEveryone is needed.\n\nFind your closest strike or register your own at https://t.co/ikOafwrNSk\n\nSpread the word!#FridaysForFuture #ClimateStrike pic.twitter.com/ekrmeUx100 \u2014 Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) September 17, 2019\n\nIn New York, 1.1 million students will be allowed to skip class and participate (with their parents' permission), the city's Department of Education said.\n\nYou can check the Global Climate Strikes website to see if there's an event near you.

But that doesn't mean it shouldn't be an issue on everyone's minds. They want allies.\n\nStrikers are also demanding \"climate justice\" to cast the climate crisis as not just an environmental issue, but also an ethical obligation.\n\nThe hope is the strikes will show world leaders that it's not just young people who want climate change to be addressed.\n\n\"September's climate strikes will kickstart a huge wave of action and renewed ambition all over the world,\" organizers say.", "description": "People all over the world are expected to walk out of their schools and workplaces Friday to demand action to address the global climate crisis.", "authors": ["Dakin Andone"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190913122708-02-greta-thunberg-climate-0913-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
