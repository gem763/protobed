Gharib is believed to have helped capture fleeing demonstrators and detain them in the prison headed by Raslan.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Stopping the protest movement\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe Syria conflict began in March 2011 with a series of mass protests demanding civil liberties, prompting a harsh crackdown by the regime which quickly began using \u201cbrutal force\u201d against anti-government protesters, prosecutors said.\n\nMore than 360,000 people have been killed in the Syrian conflict with millions more displaced.\n\nAccording to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, at least 60,000 people have died from torture or harsh conditions in regime custody since the conflict began.\n\n\u201cThe Syrian secret services played a significant role in this, with the aim of stopping the protest movement as soon as possible and cowing the population,\u201d they said.\n\nRaslan left Syria in late 2012 and arrived in Germany in July 2014, while Gharib left in February 2013 and entered the country in April 2018.\n\nThe same day that the two suspects were arrested in February, another Syrian was detained in the Paris region for \u201cacts of torture, crimes against humanity and complicity in these crimes\u201d, the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office said at the time.\n\nSeveral other legal cases are now pending against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad in Germany, which took in more than 1.2 million asylum seekers since 2015 including hundreds of thousands of Syrians.\n\nLast year, German prosecutors issued an international arrest warrant for Jamil Hassan, a top Syrian official who headed the notorious airforce intelligence directorate and is accused of overseeing the torture and murder of hundreds of detainees.\n\nAlthough the alleged abuses did not happen in Germany, the case has been filed under the legal principle of universal jurisdiction, which allows any country to pursue perpetrators regardless of where the crime was committed.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Ready to testify\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe Berlin-based European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights has also joined with torture survivors to file criminal complaints against 10 high-ranking Syrian officials, accusing them of crimes against humanity and war crimes.\n\nWelcoming Tuesday\u2019s charges, the ECCHR said: \u201cThe first trial worldwide about state torture in Syria is expected to start in Germany in early 2020 \u2013- an important step in the fight against impunity.\u201d\n\nProsecutors outlined a system of brutal interrogations of opposition members including a variety of torture methods including \u201cblows with fists, truncheons, pipes, cables, whips and hoses as well as electric shocks\u201d.\n\nPrisoners were also suspended from the ceiling by their wrists and beaten, sexually assaulted, deprived of sleep and threatened with harming their loved ones.\n\n\u201cThe systematically brutal physical and psychological mistreatment served to force confessions and extract information about the opposition movement,\u201d prosecutors said.\n\nThe ECCHR, which supports Syrian torture survivors as co-plaintiffs in legal proceedings, said 14 witnesses had participated in the German investigation.\n\n\u201cThis process in Germany gives hope, even if everything takes a long time and nothing happens tomorrow, or even the day after tomorrow,\u201d it quoted an unnamed Syrian, who was tortured in the al-Khatib detention facility where the suspects worked, as saying.\n\n\u201cThe fact that it continues at all gives us as survivors hope for justice. I am ready to testify.\u201d", "description": "Berlin (AFP) \u2013 Germany charged two alleged former Syrian secret service officers with participating in crimes against humanity, in what rights", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/148c45_security-forces-force-break-up-an-anti-government-demonstration-in-syrian-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
