This one - the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, also known as Vector - has a history of handling anthrax, Ebola, and smallpox.\n\nIts past raised concerns among some Russians who said on social media that they distrust the official reassurances, prompted in part by failures in the past of officials to convey the true dangers of such situations.\n\nNikolai Krasnikov, the town's mayor, visited the site Monday and told media that the situation was under control and there was no biological threat. Vector and Russia's consumer protection watchdog also said that no biologically hazardous substances were present at the time of the blast.\n\n\"No work with biological materials was carried out in the building,\" Vector said in an online statement.\n\nAt the same time the comments of local people in Russia's popular social network VKontakte showed that some people were reluctant to take this at face value - or at least willing to joke about it.\n\n\"They won't tell us anything,\" a person named Dmitry Maslov wrote on the site.\n\nAnother, Ivan Chelovekov, wrote: \"In Chernobyl they also said there was no danger and that everything was under control,\" referring to the 1986 reactor meltdown in the Soviet Union. Officials at the time suppressed news of the disaster.\n\nMore recently, Russian officials appeared to cover up information about the scale of a nuclear accident at a naval facility in Nyonoksa to the north of Russia.\n\nAnother, Vitaly Nikolayevich, said: \"Well, if they've said there is not biological threat danger it is the right time to get evacuated.\"\n\nOthers noted that if the mayor felt happy to give a press conference at the site, it must be safe.\n\nMeanwhile, experts said the danger may depend on the location of the explosion.\n\nIgor Nikulin, a former member of Biological Weapons Commission at the United Nations, told the National News Service that \"it is difficult to talk about the danger of the incident because it was not certain for sure if the works with the dangerous bacteria and viruses were held in the building.\"\n\n\"If such works were held there, there could be leaks. There are labs that work in open conditions but there are also closed facilities. In closed facilities they maintain special leak-tightness\u2026 They introduce very high safety measures there\u2026 If the explosion was in such facility it could be very dangerous.\"\n\nVector is one of two places in the world to store the live smallpox virus. The other sample of the deadly pathogen is stored at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nVector was founded in 1974. In the 1970s and 1980s it was actively involved in developing biological weapons.", "description": "A gas explosion hit a research lab storing anthrax, Ebola, and smallpox in Koltsovo on Monday.
