And if I didn't know right off the top of my head what I did, I could figure it out,\" the 25-year-old told Out in the Open host Piya Chattopadhyay.\n\n\"I never know what's going to stick out first,\" she added. \"Some days I might think of the outfit I was wearing first. Other days I might think of a person I talked to or a place I was first. But once I cling onto one of those details I can kind of dig deeper and find the others.\"\n\nWatch Markie Pasternak take a rapid fire history quiz:\n\nThe perils of perfect recall\n\nHSAM was first discovered by McGaugh after a woman named Jill Price approached him in 2000 about what she called a \"memory problem.\" But it was a problem he'd never heard of before.\n\n\"She claimed she remembered too much,\" McGaugh told Out in the Open. \"She claimed she could remember every day of her life.\"\n\nPrice would become known for the suffering she claimed her exceptional memory caused \u2014 due to her inability to forget the bad parts of her life, particularly the death of her husband.\n\nIn December of 2010, Price and McGaugh appeared on an episode of 60 Minutes, after which McGaugh says he heard from hundreds of people claiming to have a memory like Price's.\n\nAbout 60 of them turned out to have HSAM. More have emerged since then.\n\n\"It turns out that there are a lot of people who are just like our original subject,\" said McGaugh, \"but unlike her, they don't complain about horrible memories. A lot of them are very happy and have a lot of pleasant memories.\"\n\nPasternak has both.\n\nHer father died unexpectedly when she was 19 years old. Living with HSAM means remembering that day as though it was yesterday. And whenever Pasternak sees the date Feb. 5, her memory immediately flashes back to the day she was hit by a drunk driver during graduate school.\n\nDifficult memories are just part of the problem, though. \"The hardest part about having HSAM is that other people forget,\" Pasternak explained. \"An event or a person stays in your memory forever, but you have the ability to fade away in [theirs].\"\n\nIt's something that adds to my ability to see life in a different way. - Markie Pasternak\n\nRemembering to stay positive\n\nDespite the challenges, Pasternak says she has no interest in trading her exceptional memory for an ordinary one.\n\n\"It's served me in a lot of ways,\" she reflected. \"We remember what we pay attention to and we pay attention to what we care about, so remembering can show people that we care. ... If I'm your friend you can at least count on hearing from one person on your birthday.\"\n\nPasternak's memory has also taught her a valuable lesson on forgiveness.\n\n\"I remember things that have happened to me since fifth grade. I'm going to remember disputes or fights in so much detail that I can really relive it if I want to\u2026 and sometimes even if I don't want to!\"\n\nThe result?\n\n\"Forgiving isn't something you do once. It's something that you do every day.\"\n\nNOW OR NEVER: CBC Radio host reveals his personal struggle with OCD\n\nPasternak believes her HSAM is tied to the fact that she has obsessive compulsive disorder, something that's come up in McGaugh's research. And while she values the treatment she's received for OCD, she says she has no desire to rid herself of the memory that appears to go with it.\n\n\"It's something that adds to my ability to see life in a different way.\"\n\nThis story appears in the Out in the Open episode, \"The Special Edition\".", "description": "Markie Pasternack has Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory (HSAM), meaning she has a nearly perfect memory for things that have happened to her and things she happens to have heard about.
