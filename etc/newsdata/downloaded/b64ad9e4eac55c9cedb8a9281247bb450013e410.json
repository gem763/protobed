But it\u2019ll also usher in an extraordinary logistical challenge for the six sitting Democratic Senators duking it out for their party\u2019s presidential nomination in 2020: they may be required in Washington during the peak of the early primary campaign.\n\nWhether the House will vote to impeach President Trump is still uncertain, of course. But Congressional insiders tell TIME that if House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announces a vote, it would likely be before Thanksgiving. After that, it\u2019ll take a least week to set up television cameras, hang lights and move furniture to make room for the President\u2019s defense team and the prosecution in the Senate chamber, a senior aide to Leadership said. Which means that the Senate trial would likely begin in December. (That back-of-the-envelope calendar assumes that those investigating the President, who are picking up new leads with every day of testimony, limit the list of new witnesses.)\n\nIf lawmakers use the rules from the last impeachment trial in 1999, then hearings would begin promptly at 1 p.m. six days a week\u2014Monday through Saturday\u2014effectively shackling the six Senators-cum-Democratic-candidates to their desks on Capitol Hill. The timing could be tricky: if an impeachment trial happens anytime late this year or early next year, it\u2019ll run up against the first-in-nation caucuses in Iowa on Feb. 3 and the primary vote in New Hampshire on Feb. 11.\n\nGiven that calendar, Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and Michael Bennet risk losing out on invaluable time on the campaign trail. And their top competitors, including Former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, may be able to capitalize on their collective hiatus from the trail.\n\nThe six Senators\u2019 mandatory Washington interlude may also spark an ad war\u2014on both TV and the Internet\u2014as a proxy for in-person campaign events in Iowa, New Hampshire and beyond. \u201cWe did not build this into our media budget,\u201d one campaign aide to a Senator running for President told TIME, referencing an impeachment trial. \u201cWe had counted on some earned media in-state. Now, we probably won\u2019t even be in the state to earn it.\u201d\n\nIf a potential impeachment proceeding slipped into 2020, it may further shape the Democratic primary race. While the incumbent Democratic Senators would miss even more in-state campaigning time, they may benefit from a national media laser-focused on the events unfolding in Washington.\n\n\u201cI could also argue that the non-Senators will have trouble getting media attention during the Senate trial, and media attention is the most valuable commodity in presidential politics,\u201d says Alex Conant, a Republican strategist who was a top aide to Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s race for the GOP nomination while also in the Senate. \u201cThe Senate trial is potentially a huge opportunity for any of the Senators running for President to have a breakthrough moment. But if they fail to seize the opportunity, then they\u2019ll really regret the days lost in the early states.\u201d\n\nOthers point out that a Senate trial is not a helpul format for driving headlines. While Senators Harris, Klobuchar and Booker have created viral moments in the Senate Judiciary Committee with sharp and smart questions, an impeachment trial requires that Senators act, in effect, as jurors. They can only ask questions in writing to the Supreme Court\u2019s Chief Justice, who presides over the session. That format offers scant chance for individual Senators to drive headlines from the Senate floor.\n\n\u201cI think several of them will look to create viral moments while here during the week. Even off the floor,\u201d says Bryan DeAngeles, a former campaign and Senate aide to Chris Dodd, who ran for President in 2008 from his seat in the Senate. \u201cThey\u2019ll look to capitalize on any media moment they can create and heavily promote it back into Iowa and New Hampshire.\u201d\n\nWhile the six Senators\u2019 campaigns are aware of the potential logistical challenges, they say it\u2019s too early to speak publicly about potential plans. \u201cTough to say, as we don\u2019t know what the schedule is,\u201d said Sabrina Singh, a spokeswoman for Booker\u2019s presidential bid. \u201cEverything depends on the House still.\u201d\n\nIn a closed-door lunch on Oct. 16, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, briefing his Republican caucus on the logistics of impeachment, seemed to suggest that he considered an impeachment trial all but inevitable, according to two senior aids to Republican Leadership.\n\nIt\u2019s far too early to determine how an impeachment proceeding may shape the Democratic nomination process. The first four states\u2014Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina\u2014award just 4% of all pledged delegates. But political insiders contend that it\u2019s the narrative, formed in the media and among donors and activists, that is invaluable. A candidate who is sidelined as the first four states would likely struggle to regain prominence afterward.\n\nThe Senate-based contenders thus far aren\u2019t complaining. Every Democrat on stage last week at an Ohio debate supported impeachment proceedings, which are popular with the party\u2019s base. (The sixth Senator in the race, Michael Bennet\u2014who did not qualify for the debate\u2014has said Trump has committed impeachable offenses but they were still at the beginning of the investigations.)\n\nIn a field so crowded and divided, impeachment is a rare unifier. \u201cSometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics,\u201d Warren said during last week\u2019s debate, \u201cand I think that\u2019s the case with this impeachment inquiry.\u201d", "description": "The six Democratic Senators who are also running for president may be required to be in Washington during the early primary campaign.", "authors": ["Philip Elliott"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gP3NTGhGwVy025j_lFrn3g--~B/aD0xNjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/6041dcf83a3783ea0b851cb36b68ea96", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
