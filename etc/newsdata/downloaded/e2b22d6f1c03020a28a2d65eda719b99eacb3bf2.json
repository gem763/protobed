He remained in critical condition on Tuesday night.\n\nThe incident could lead to further hostility between anti-government protesters and the police force, as Hong Kong\u2019s worst political crisis in decades \u2013 triggered by a now-withdrawn extradition bill \u2013 shows no sign of abating.\n\nPolice also fired five live-round warning shots skywards in other neighborhoods as violence reached an unprecedented level, with officers battling large groups of protesters across the city.\n\nHong Kong, one of the most crowded metropolises in the world, had been in virtual lockdown since the morning, with many shops and subway stations closed.\n\nThe turmoil in the former British colony was in sharp contrast to the rest of China, where hundreds of millions of people watched on television or online what was billed as the grandest military parade in the history of the People\u2019s Republic.\n\nAll retired and present party leaders \u2013 with the noticeable absence of former premier Zhu Rongji and former vice-president Li Yuanchao \u2013 joined President Xi Jinping on the rostrum of the Gate of Heavenly Peace, where the republic\u2019s founding father Mao Zedong declared communist rule on October 1, 1949.\n\nA pro-democracy protester walks in front of a burning barricade Tuesday, as demonstrations in Hong Kong mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of China's communist rule. | Chris McGrath/Getty Images\n\nFlanked by his predecessors Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, Xi used his eight-minute televised speech to praise the accomplishments of Chinese people over the past seven decades and pledged to achieve his vision of a \u201cChinese dream\u201d of national rejuvenation and global prominence.\n\nHong Kong also featured prominently in the celebrations. Xi said China must uphold the principle of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d that promises a high degree of autonomy to Hong Kong while preserving its freedoms and unique lifestyle following its return to Chinese rule.\n\n\u201cWe need to maintain the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong and Macau,\u201d the president said in his speech.\n\nThe city\u2019s embattled Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor appeared on the Gate of Heavenly Peace during the ceremony, and 10 Hong Kong police officers also attended the event.\n\nBut in Hong Kong, the mood could not have been more different. Defying a police ban, tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets in the early afternoon. Spontaneous protests broke out in different parts of the city, where violent demonstrators attacked officers with bricks, petrol bombs, acid bombs and sticks. Police responded with full force, using water cannons, tear gas, rubber bullets and beanbag rounds.\n\nThe fighting was more vicious and intense than in previous days, with the worst scene taking place near Tai Ho Road in Tsuen Wan in the afternoon.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the fighting began, but video footage taken by the City University Students\u2019 Union Editorial Board showed a number of protesters beating and stabbing a police officer, who was on the ground. Another officer tried to help him but was stopped by two rod-wielding protesters. The officer pulled out his service revolver and pointed it at them, issuing a verbal warning. One struck his right arm with a rod and the officer opened fire at about 4:15 p.m.\n\nThe masked protester, who was later confirmed to be a secondary student, fell to the ground and other protesters ran from the scene. One tried to help his injured friend, who remained conscious immediately after he was shot, but was subdued by a police officer.\n\nVideo clips of the shooting quickly circulated on social media, and rumors soon started to spread about shootings in other places but none of them could be verified.\n\nHong Kong Human Rights Monitor director Law Yuk-kai, after seeing the video clip, concluded that what the officer did was \u201cnot appropriate\u201d and said he had made a \u201cwrong judgment\u201d.\n\nLaw said the shooting could have been prevented. \u201cThe officer should have de-escalated the tension instead of raising the danger level,\u201d he said.\n\nA police spokeswoman confirmed that an 18-year-old protester had been hit by a live round, injuring the area near his left shoulder, and had been taken to Princess Margaret Hospital.\n\n\u201c[Protesters] continued with their attack after officers warned them to stop. As an officer felt his life was under serious threat, he fired a round at the assailant to save his own life and his colleagues\u2019 lives,\u201d the spokeswoman said in a recorded video posted to the force\u2019s Facebook page.\n\n\u201cThe police force really did not want to see anyone being injured, so we feel very sad about this. We warn rioters to stop breaking the law immediately, as we will strictly enforce the law,\u201d she added.\n\nSafeguard Hong Kong Alliance, a pro-government group, said the incident was regrettable but defended the police officer. \u201cHe did so under a violent attack that put him and his colleague in danger ... The student was misled by others to use violence against the police. Those agitators should be held accountable for this,\u201d an alliance spokesman said.\n\nThe fighting continued well into the night, leaving a trail of destruction across Hong Kong, Kowloon and the New Territories. In total, 66 people were injured and more than 180 arrested.\n\nThe MTR Corporation continued to be targeted by protesters, who accuse the railway operator of colluding with police. Protesters lit fires at the entrances to several closed stations, including Wan Chai, Sham Shui Po and Causeway Bay.\n\nGovernment offices, shops owned by Beijing-friendly businesses and at least three offices of pro-establishment lawmakers were also vandalized and defaced.\n\nAlthough the rampage in Hong Kong\u2019s streets made international headlines, coverage was conspicuously absent from the mainland\u2019s heavily censored media.\n\nWhile the rest of the country celebrated its resurgence after \u201ca century of humiliation,\u201d its financial center and special administrative region was cloaked in fire and smoke. And as an extravagant fireworks show lit up the night sky of Beijing, exhausted Hong Kong police and protesters faced off against each other on tear gas-filled streets, with no end in sight.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/1b/3e/b94a39714b7ebca0047b089bfe10/20191001-hong-kong-protests-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
