But I think we're well prepared to keep going if Brexit does happen, sooner rather than later, and there is no deal.\"\n\nTeam staff are also likely to face uncertainty.\n\nMcLaren's German team boss Andreas Seidl said he had already been given a guarantee he can stay in Britain.\n\n\"As a team, we simply did our homework and prepared for every possible scenario. I'm sure that whatever happens in the next weeks and months there will be solutions in place and we will keep going racing.\"", "description": "The chief of British-based Formula 1 outfit Mercedes Toto Wolff said on Saturday the United Kingdom crashing out of the European Union without a deal would harm his business.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3688/0239e1cb120145fe84078e7e92c516fe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
