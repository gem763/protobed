For many older women, no matter what life throws at you, you carry on and never show weakness.\n\nToday\u2019s younger generation - like Harry and Megan \u2013 are so different. These \u2018sensitive souls\u2019 seem to get easily upset, they need time every day for meditation and mindfulness.\n\nThey stress out over what\u2019s for dinner in case the ingredients have harmed a plant or an animal or were brought to the store in a gas guzzling lorry.\n\nIsn\u2019t this getting out of hand? Most people care about protecting the environment, eradicating poverty, harming animals and empowering women, but is it possible to keep these issues in perspective while we get on with everyday living?\n\nHarry\u2019s recent confessions make me wonder - are younger people just too thin skinned?\n\nCher is pictured above performing at the O2 in London earlier this week\n\nLuckily, there\u2019s some oldies around like Cher to keep our spirits up. This week, the Queen of ageing disgracefully has been wowing fans at London\u2019s O2 Arena - telling her audience of 20,000 \u2018I\u2019m 73 years old. What is your grandma doing tonight?\u2019 Fighting talk!\n\nCher married Sonny Bono at 16, and never looked back. After three miscarriages, she gave birth to a baby girl who in 2008 underwent gender reassignment - Chastity became Chaz, now an actor.\n\nAfter divorcing Sonny, she married musician Greg Allman, a serial substance abuser. Their child Elijah, has had a difficult relationship with his mother, who was furious when he eloped to get married.\n\nBut Cher doesn\u2019t dwell on the past, her complex family life and her failed relationships - she\u2019s an entertainer.\n\nOn tour, she has a dozen costume changes in 90 minutes, wears a huge blue wig, tiny corsets and fishnet tights and ruthlessly mocks herself.\n\nCher is living proof that ageing is a state of mind. She totally lacks self-pity, even though she\u2019s been endlessly parodied. Cher is fearless and thoroughly modern.\n\nAnother modern pensioner has become a best selling author at the age of 87 - Lady Anne Glenconner. She\u2019s spent her life in the company of royalty and her memoir, Lady in Waiting is a total hoot - I can\u2019t put it down.\n\nLady in Waiting combines top name-dropping with a feast of indiscreet revelations.\n\nLady Anne Glenconner (pictured above) has become a best selling author at the age of 87\n\nFar from being a po-faced guide to Upstairs rather than Downstairs in Britain\u2019s poshest families, it\u2019s the story of her marriage to a bonkers toff who threw embarrassing tantrums and stripped off to reveal his nasty paper underpants on planes.\n\nHer childhood was spent in a grand house with dozens of rooms and a distant dad, who was furious she wasn\u2019t a boy.\n\nAnne became best pals with the most difficult member of the British royal family - Princess Margaret. Now, she\u2019s being consulted by Helena Bonham Carter, playing PM in series 2 of the Crown. Anne thinks that Margaret mark one - as portrayed by Vanessa Kirby \u2018wasn\u2019t quite right\u2019 - but is sure that Helena will have more luck.\n\nLady Glenconner seems totally without regrets, in spite of marriage to a man who took her to a brothel on the second night of their honeymoon, and who had affairs with both men and women.\n\nShe\u2019s lost two of her five children, one to Hepatitis C (following heroin addiction) and another to HIV, and nearly lost a third (Christopher) in a serious crash- luckily he eventually recovered.\n\nShe is someone who doesn\u2019t complain, a can-do positive person thrilled with whatever each day brings. There\u2019s no self-obsession, no sense of entitlement, or snobbery, no \u2018woke\u2019 hand-wringing about the parlous state of the world.\n\nShe\u2019s equally happy talking to a cleaner as duke - and on all those trips as Princess Margaret\u2019s Lady in Waiting she must have indispensable.\n\nAnne left school at 16 as her father (the Earl of Leicester) thought it wasn\u2019t worth educating girls, and after a couple of courses at finishing school, went out on the road as a travelling saleswoman flogging her mother\u2019s pottery, driving herself around the country and staying in cheap hotels.\n\nChosen as a Maid of Honour at Elizabeth\u2019s Coronation, she slept on the floor of a relative\u2019s flat the night before and nearly fainted during the service, reviving herself with a swig of booze from the Archbishop\u2019s secret flask.\n\nShe bears no resentments, in spite of being tied to her bed every night by a governess, and being dumped by her first boyfriend, who went on to father Princess Diana.\n\nAnne tells us that Princess Margaret had a difficult marriage to Anthony Armstrong Jones, who used to leave nasty notes among her underwear.\n\nOne said \u201cYou look like a Jewish manicurist and I hate you\u201d.\n\nAnne never complains about her own husband\u2019s bizarre business ventures, including buying the island of Mustique without ever setting foot on it.\n\nIn the end, Colin Tennant went to live on St Lucia, where I met him. Colin owned a pet elephant which deposited a giant pile of poo next to the table where we were having dinner with Bryan Ferry and his wife Lucy.\n\nTo say Colin was eccentric would be a vast understatement - he was wearing silk pyjamas at the time.\n\nI wonder what Cher and Anne Glenconner would make of Harry and Meghan\u2019s troubled relationship with the world at large. I am sure their advice would be the same. Just grit your teeth and get on with it, darlings.", "description": "JANET STREET PORTER: Today's younger generation - like Harry and Megan are sensitive souls.
