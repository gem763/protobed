His movement is really good.\n\nHasselbaink says Chelsea\u2019s young guns can \u2018dominate\u2019 the Premier League (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018I think when he plays in a dominant team he will score lots of goals because of his movement and he gets himself on the end of things. That is a good habit to have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He holds the ball up [well], gets the ball past [the defender] and gets his shots away. Those are really good attributes that a striker needs to have.\n\n\u2018He scores ugly goals. So for me he should be able to get 20 plus goals.\u2019\n\nAbraham was one of four Chelsea players included in Gareth Southgate\u2019s England squad this week.\n\nThe Blues are currently seventh in the Premier League but Hasselbaink has been impressed by Lampard\u2019s young side and says they can \u2018dominate\u2019 the Premier League in \u2018two or three years\u2019.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s magnificent to see,\u2019 he said, referring to Chelsea\u2019s youth being handed international call-ups.\n\n\u2018For Chelsea, especially, their identity has not been like that in the past but if they can keep this group together and they have got Callum [Hudson-Odoi] as well, Ruben [Loftus-Cheek], Reece James.\n\n\u2018If they can keep those boys together I think in two or three years Chelsea can really dominate the Premier League, obviously with additions to the squad.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018It is nice to see, also for the Chelsea fans. I do think that the Chelsea fans should be patient because if you want to see young players you are not going to win trophies or compete for the Premier League [straight away].\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018If Chelsea can still keep themselves in Europe, hopefully in the Champions League, with these players and let them get the experience then the future is going to be very bright for Chelsea.\u2019\n\nLampard\u2019s Chelsea travel to St Mary\u2019s on Sunday to face Southampton, who are currently 14th in the Premier League.\n\nMORE: Michael Owen explains why Arsenal will secure Premier League top-four finish under Unai Emery", "description": "Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has challenged Tammy Abraham to score at least 20 goals for Chelsea this season and backed Frank Lampard's young guns to 'dominate' the Premier League.
