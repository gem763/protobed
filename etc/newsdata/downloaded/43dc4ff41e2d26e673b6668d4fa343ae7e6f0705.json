(Markus Schreiber;Jabin Botsford;Dimitrios Kambouris/AP;The Washington Post;Getty Images for Playboy)\n\nHouse Democrats plan to make President Trump\u2019s alleged involvement in a 2016 scheme to silence two women who claimed they had affairs with him a major investigative focus this fall, picking up where federal prosecutors left off in a case legal experts say could have led to additional indictments.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee is preparing to hold hearings and call witnesses involved in hush-money payments to ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult-film star Stormy Daniels as soon as October, according to people familiar with the plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions.\n\nDemocrats say they believe there is already enough evidence to name Trump as a co-conspirator in the episode that resulted in his former attorney, Michael Cohen, pleading guilty to two campaign-finance charges.\n\nCohen, who is serving a three-year prison sentence for those counts and other crimes, testified under oath that Trump directed the payments that helped land him behind bars. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan also described Trump\u2019s alleged role in the scheme, referring to him in court papers as \u201cIndividual-1.\u201d But they concluded their investigation this summer without bringing any additional charges.\n\nThe hush-money inquiry will open a new chapter in the House\u2019s months-long consideration of whether to draft articles of impeachment against the president.\n\nMore than 130 House Democrats have called for an official impeachment inquiry to begin, although House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has cautioned that trying to remove Trump would be divisive and politically risky without public support.\n\nThe new congressional inquiry will reopen questions about the extent of Trump\u2019s involvement in the episode \u2014 and whether he would have been charged if not for Justice Department opinions that a sitting president cannot be indicted.\n\n\u201cThe fingerprints are all over this one \u2014 it\u2019s not like a big mystery,\u201d said Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), a member of the Judiciary panel. \u201cAs with the evidence of presidential obstruction of justice, the conclusion seems inescapable: that [Trump] would have been tried had he been anybody else. And now it\u2019s left to Congress again to figure out what to do with the lawbreaking and apparent impunity of the president.\u201d\n\nTrump, his aides and attorneys have made contradictory statements about the president\u2019s knowledge of the payments. But his lawyers have repeatedly denied that Trump committed wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cNo campaign violations were engaged in by the president,\u201d said Jay Sekulow, Trump\u2019s personal attorney.\n\nAs part of the probe, Democrats plan to explore whether the investigation was stymied or obstructed. The Judiciary Committee is also considering as a potential witness David Pecker, the chairman and CEO of American Media Inc., the parent company of the National Enquirer, which admitted making the payment to McDougal.\n\n\n\nMichael Cohen, President Trump's former lawyer, leaves federal court after his sentencing in New York. (Craig Ruttle/AP)\n\nAMI complied with a document request Democrats made earlier this year, giving the committee all communications it previously turned over to law enforcement, according to the people familiar with the inquiry.\n\nA lawyer for Pecker, Elkan Abramowitz, declined to comment. AMI declined to comment.\n\n[Publisher of the National Enquirer admits to hush-money payments made on Trump\u2019s behalf]\n\nThe conclusion of the campaign-finance investigation this summer surprised some former federal prosecutors and legal experts, who noted that other participants in the alleged scheme were granted immunity or non-prosecution agreements, which often signal that the case is focused on additional targets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable Michael Cohen acted alone . . . what happened?\u201d said Duncan Levin, a former prosecutor for the Justice Department and Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office. \u201cWhen you have one of the most important, sensitive investigations into the president and his family and his company, and then when you unexpectedly drop it, it is going to raise a lot of questions.\u201d\n\nA Justice Department spokesman in Washington referred questions to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office of the Southern District of New York, which declined to comment.\n\n[A majority of House Democrats want to open an impeachment inquiry into Trump]\n\nIt remains to be seen how far congressional Democrats will be able to get in their inquiry. So far, Trump and his administration have succeeded in blocking many of the House oversight investigations refusing to provide information and challenging subpoenas in court.\n\nWhen the House returns to session next week, the Judiciary panel plans to continue focusing on five episodes of potential obstruction of justice by the president outlined in special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s lengthy report this spring. Democrats have argued that Trump would have been charged with obstruction in those five instances were he not president.\n\nThe hush-money payments represent a sixth instance of potentially impeachable presidential misbehavior, they say.\n\nThe scheme began in the final months of the 2016 campaign, when Cohen has said there was building fear in Trump\u2019s inner circle that McDougal and Daniels would go public with allegations that they had sexual encounters with Trump years earlier.\n\nCohen told prosecutors that \u201cin coordination with and at the direction\u201d of Trump, he worked with Pecker to pay $150,000 to McDougal as part of a \u201ccatch and kill\u201d operation. He also said he worked \u201cin coordination\u201d with the then-GOP presidential candidate to arrange a $130,000 payment to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford.\n\n[Michael Cohen says he worked to silence two women \u2018in coordination\u2019 with Trump to influence 2016 election]\n\nTrump and his aides initially denied knowing about the payments \u2014 and then offered shifting explanations for their purpose.\n\n\u201cWe have no knowledge of any of this,\u201d spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in November 2016, after the Wall Street Journal reported on the payment to McDougal.\n\nAfter the Journal reported on the existence of the Daniels payment early last year, a reporter on Air Force One asked the president: \u201cDid you know about the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Trump responded.\n\n\u201cThen why did Michael Cohen make [the payment], if there was no truth to her allegations?\u201d a reporter asked.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask Michael Cohen,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe following month, however, Trump attorney Rudolph Giuliani said that the president reimbursed Cohen for the $130,000 paid to Daniels, adding that Trump \u201cdidn\u2019t know about the specifics of it, as far as I know.\u201d\n\n[Fact Checker: Not just misleading. Not merely false. A lie.]\n\nBut Cohen said in federal court and before Congress that Trump directed the payments.\n\nIn testimony before the House Oversight Committee in February, Cohen said Trump had assured him in an Oval Office meeting that he would take care of Cohen\u2019s debt related to Daniels, which Cohen had financed through a line of credit.\n\nCohen displayed what he said were reimbursement checks for the $130,000 payment to Daniels \u2014 one dated Aug. 1, 2017, which he said was signed by the president; the other from March 17, 2017, which he said was signed by Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s son, and Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization\u2019s chief financial officer\n\n\u201cI am going to jail in part because of my decision to help Mr. Trump hide that payment from the American people before they voted a few days later,\u201d he said.\n\nFederal prosecutors also implicated Trump in the hush-money scheme, noting in court filings before Cohen\u2019s sentencing that the former Trump lawyer \u201cadmitted, with respect to both payments, he acted in coordination with and at the direction of Individual-1,\u201d a reference to the president.\n\n[Court filings directly implicate Trump in efforts to buy women\u2019s silence, reveal new contact between inner circle and Russian]\n\nThe payments essentially functioned as in-kind donations to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, prosecutors said. The money paid to McDougal by National Enquirer parent company AMI violated a ban on corporate contributions, while the money that Cohen directed to Daniels constituted an excessive campaign contribution, they alleged.\n\nProsecutors also released a non-prosecution agreement struck with AMI, in which the company said it knowingly acted \u201cin concert\u201d with Trump\u2019s campaign to silence the women and did not notify the Federal Election Commission of the election-related payments.\n\nProsecutors said AMI officials knew \u201cexpenditures by corporations, made for purposes of influencing an election and in coordination with or at the request of a candidate or campaign, are unlawful,\u201d the agreement said.\n\nThe document acknowledged that AMI\u2019s main purpose was \u201cto suppress the model\u2019s story so as to prevent it from influencing the election,\u201d the agreement said.\n\nAs part of the deal, AMI agreed to cooperate with any law enforcement agency pursuing the matter and to train executives and editorial employees on election laws and their application to media operations.\n\nIn addition, federal prosecutors secured the cooperation of Weisselberg, who testified before a grand jury. But no further charges were filed.\n\nIn July, the federal judge supervising the case, William H. Pauley III, said \u201cthe government has effectively concluded its investigations\u201d of who besides Cohen was involved.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney picked up an aspect of the case, issuing subpoenas in August to the Trump Organization about the money paid to Daniels as part of an inquiry into whether the Trump Organization falsified business records.\n\nA lawyer for the Trump Organization, Alan Futerfas, declined to comment.\n\n[Manhattan district attorney seeks documents related to Stormy Daniels hush money payment]\n\nIt remains unknown whether federal prosecutors would have sought to charge Trump if not for Justice Department legal opinions concluding that indicting a sitting president could interfere with the office\u2019s unique constitutional responsibilities. In part because of those opinions, Mueller decided that he could not even consider whether to charge Trump in his obstruction-of-justice inquiry.\n\nNew York University law professor Stephen Gillers called it \u201ctroublesome\u201d that the campaign-finance case ended without providing more answers, arguing that \u201cit would disserve the public interest if the Justice Department did not eventually disclose who else was party to Michael Cohen\u2019s crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is clear evidence that one or more people participated in Cohen's crime,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just don't know who they are and whether they are subject to investigation and could still be prosecuted.\u201d\n\nKarl Sandstrom, a former member of the Federal Election Commission, said that based on his review of the matter, prosecutors in Manhattan had an \u201cexceedingly strong case.\u201d He questioned why they did not pursue others involved.\n\n\u201cThey saw fit to put Michael Cohen in jail,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t the people who authorized and paid for this culpable?\u201d\n\nIn announcing the conclusion of investigation, Pauley immediately released documents that were previously under seal, saying every citizen should have \u201can opportunity to scrutinize the materials\u201d in a case of \u201cnational importance.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats saw his comments as an indication that they should pick up the investigation, according to aides familiar with their investigative plans.\n\nThe Judiciary panel is now eyeing Pecker and AMI as potential sources of new information. The committee this summer authorized subpoenas for Pecker, a close Trump confidant for years, and National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard, who also cooperated with federal prosecutors.\n\nDocuments released by Pauley show that after The Washington Post published a recording in October 2016 in which Trump bragged about groping women, Cohen exchanged \u201ca series\u201d of messages and calls with Pecker, Howard, Trump and Daniels\u2019s attorney, among others.\n\nThe documents included notes of an FBI agent that stated, \u201cbased on the timing of these calls, and the content of the text messages and emails, I believe that at least some of these communications concerned the need to prevent Clifford from going public.\u201d\n\n[Trump spoke repeatedly with Cohen, aides amid scramble to pay Stormy Daniels, court documents show]\n\nAs part of the probe, Democrats are expected to put a spotlight on Trump\u2019s evolving explanations about what he knew of the scheme, according to the people familiar with the strategy. They also hope to review a Justice Department decision to end the hush-money query by pressing Barr about it directly in a future hearing.", "description": "The House Judiciary Committee is preparing to hold hearings on payments made in 2016 to two women who claimed they had affairs with Trump years earlier.", "authors": ["Rachael Bade", "Congressional Reporter", "Tom Hamburger", "Investigative Reporter Focused On The Intersection Of Money", "Politics In Washington", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/eTpOfNqMZo1JF2IRZB2Z7rr1iBo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2JMSVVGNZMI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg"}
