They added that they're \"updating what it means for channels to be \u201cVerified\u201d w/ new eligibility criteria & a new look.\"\n\nIn a document detailing the new changes, YouTube explained, \"Our new criteria prioritizes verifying prominent channels that have a clear need for proof of authenticity.\" They added that they'll be looking at \"authenticity\" and \"prominence\" when deciding who gets verified.\n\nAlmost immediately, YouTubers flooded the replies of the original tweet and expressed their many, many concerns, including how this new change \"penalizes the upcoming YouTubers.\" One said, \"If I lose verification, which the email implies I will, my channel with 1.7 million subs will be ripe for impersonation. How does this make things clearer for either the audience or creators?\" Another Twitter user added, \"Youtube. Not everyone in your God Forsaken website has to be a fucking celebrity...Everytime you do this; you drive away more and more people away with nowhere else to go.\"\n\nIt should be easy to know when you\u2019ve found the official YouTube channel of a creator, artist, brand, or public figure.\n\n\n\nSo in late October, we\u2019re updating what it means for channels to be \u201cVerified\u201d w/ new eligibility criteria & a new look.\n\n\n\nDetails \u2192 https://t.co/Gz1cD71IA6 pic.twitter.com/JXOvMbkbns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 TeamYouTube (@TeamYouTube) September 19, 2019\n\nJames also spoke up about the new changes and said:\n\n\"I\u2019m really sorry to the creators who are being unverified on @YouTube today. This decision is really pointless and it\u2019s yet another change not a single person asked for. PLEASE know that you are still valid as a creator and I hope that a stupid checkmark doesn\u2019t discourage you! If a user gets unverified as a result of these new changes, YouTube said they can appeal.\"\n\nBut after everyone freaked out and said the platform was unverifying people, YouTube put out another statement that said they haven't actually implemented the new changes just yet and that if someone wants to appeal their new status, they can.\n\nAdditional clarification:\n\n\u2714\ufe0fNo one lost a verification badge today\u2013If you received an email that your channel will no longer be verified, this was just an advanced notice & you can appeal\n\n\u2714\ufe0fThe checkmark has never appeared on YouTube mobile channel pages (this will be added soon) https://t.co/vv64ClfuBx\n\n\n\n\u2014 YouTube Creators (@YTCreators) September 19, 2019\n\nThe comments under that last tweet were just as furious though, so it looks like YouTube still has a ~situation~ on their hands.
