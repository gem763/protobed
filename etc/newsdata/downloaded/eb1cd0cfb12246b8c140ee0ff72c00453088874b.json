You can transfer existing credit card debt to a balance transfer card that offers no interest for up to 21 months and benefit from paying off your debt faster and at a lower cost. (See our round-up of the best balance transfer cards.) Completing a balance transfer is relatively easy and can save you hundreds of dollars on interest \u2014 as long as you prioritize paying off this debt in a timely manner. Before you jump on a balance transfer offer, it's important to consider the terms associated with the promotion and how it will work into your budget. Below, CNBC Select explains how to complete a balance transfer, some best practices to follow and common terms you should familiarize yourself with prior to transferring debt.\n\nHow balance transfers work\n\nWhen you make a balance transfer, you move debt from one credit card to a new card that offers a low or 0% introductory interest rate period, which usually lasts six to 21 months. During this period, you won't incur interest charges and can benefit from your payments going entirely toward your principal balance. The average balance Americans carry on their credit cards in 2019 is $6,028, according to Experian. To find out how much the average American can save with a balance transfer, we used a Bankrate calculator to tally the interest rates and fees you could incur if you transferred debt to an intro 0% APR card. We assumed a $6,028 credit card balance and $200 monthly payments. With a typical credit card, the average consumer would spend $1,911 in additional interest, assuming the average 17.7% APR. And it would take 40 months \u2014 more than three years \u2014 to pay off that debt. But if you take full advantage of a credit card's intro APR period for balance transfers and pay $200 per month, you'd pay less than $450 in interest and cut your repayment time in half to 20 months. For example, our No. 1 balance transfer card is the Amex EveryDay\u00ae Credit Card, which offers 0% for the first 15 months on balance transfers made within 60 days from account opening (14.74% to 25.74% variable APR after that) and no balance transfer fee. (See rates and fees.) If you completed a balance transfer with this card, you'd pay only $419 in total estimated fees and interest on debt repayment. That's $1,492 less than a typical credit card.\n\nHow do payments work when you make new purchases on a balance transfer card\n\nWhile a balance transfer card can be a great asset, things can get a bit complicated when you use the card for new purchases and the intro 0% APR offer only applies to balance transfers. Some balance transfer cards only offer introductory 0% APRs on transferred debt, meaning new purchases will incur the standard purchase APR. If you only make the minimum payment on your balance transfer credit card, the money will go toward the balance with the lowest interest rate \u2014 i.e. the balance you transferred to the card. Any payment above the minimum will then go toward the balance with the highest APR \u2014 new purchases. Let's take an example where you transferred debt to a new card with an intro 0% APR on balance transfers only and a $25 minimum payment. If you spend $400 on new purchases and make a payment, the first $25 goes toward the balance you transferred, not the balance you just incurred from making new purchases. If you want to pay off what you borrowed that month in full and avoid interest altogether, you'd need to pay off the amount you spent plus the minimum payment, so $425. Any additional payment would then go toward the balance with no interest that you transferred. So if you paid $500, $400 would go toward the balance from new purchases and the remaining $100 would go toward transferred debt.\n\nHow to complete a balance transfer\n\nBalance transfers can be completed in a few simple steps. The process varies a bit by card issuer, but is generally the same. The simplest way to complete a balance transfer is online. You can also complete a transfer over the phone by calling the number on the back of your card. Here's how to complete a balance transfer online: Log into your account and select your balance transfer offer. Review the terms of your offer (length of the intro APR period, regular purchase APR and any balance transfer fees). Fill out the form with the details of your transfer: credit card account number for the card with debt and the amount you want to transfer. Verify the information you entered is correct, then submit the transfer.\n\nBalance transfer best practices\n\nCheck your credit score before applying. Most balance transfer cards are reserved for people with good or excellent credit (though we found one card that may accept fair credit). You should check your credit score to see if you may qualify for a balance transfer card before you begin the application process.\n\nMost balance transfer cards are reserved for people with good or excellent credit (though we found one card that may accept fair credit).

For example, you can't transfer debt from one Citi card to another Citi card. Request a balance transfer as soon as possible. Many cards set time limits on when you can complete a transfer, often within 60 days from the date your account is opened. If you miss this window, you may miss out on the intro APR period. Also, the intro APR period begins when you open the card, not when you make the transfer, so it's best to make the transfer as soon as possible so you can maximize the intro period.\n\nMany cards set time limits on when you can complete a transfer, often within 60 days from the date your account is opened.

Review the balance transfer limits. Card issuers often limit the amount of debt you can transfer to a percentage of your credit limit or a specific dollar amount. For example, terms for the Chase Slate\u00ae Credit Card state: \"The total amount of your request(s) including fees and interest charges cannot exceed your available credit or $15,000, whichever is lower.\" If you have a $10,000 credit limit, the max you can transfer is $10,000.\n\nCard issuers often limit the amount of debt you can transfer to a percentage of your credit limit or a specific dollar amount.

Do the math to see if a balance transfer fee is worthwhile. Balance transfer cards often come with a balance transfer fee. The fee can be worth the amount you save on interest, but you should do the math to make sure. There are many free calculators, such as this one from Bankrate, available to tell you how much you can save with a given card.\n\nBalance transfer cards often come with a balance transfer fee.

While you're benefiting from an introductory 0% APR period, you're still required to make minimum monthly payments toward your balance. If you miss a payment, you may risk losing out on the intro offer.\n\nCommon balance transfer terms\n\nThere can be a lot of jargon to consider when navigating a balance transfer. Here are a few terms to know. Balance transfer fee : Most balance transfer cards charge a fee, ranging from 3% to 5%, when you transfer a balance. The fee is often outweighed by the benefits of completing a balance transfer, though there are cards that don't charge balance transfer fees and allow you to maximize savings.\n\n: Most balance transfer cards charge a fee, ranging from 3% to 5%, when you transfer a balance.

Intro APR period : The special financing period that provides a low or 0% interest rate for a predetermined amount of time. During this period, you can benefit from carrying a balance with no or minimal interest charges. The intro APR period may only apply to balance transfers or to both balance transfers and new purchases.

Deferred interest: Some balance transfer cards have fine print that states there are no interest charges if you pay your balance in full before the end of the intro period. But if you carry a balance after the intro period, you may be responsible for all the interest accrued during the intro period. This can be an unexpected surprise if you weren't aware of the terms. Deferred interest is rare among major card issuers, but it s something you should check for before choosing a balance transfer card.
