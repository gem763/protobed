The long term is that he\u2019s come here and he\u2019s just turned 21 and he's played like he did today. You can see his balance and awareness and you can see how he can play.\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot more to come. It\u2019s not the end of the story. There\u2019s improvement to come as with all the young players, but I'm delighted for him because he will feel good about that.\n\n\"And he should do, because he was a big part of us winning that game.\u201d", "description": "MATT BARLOW AT STAMFORD BRIDGE: Christian Pulisic delivered a stylish cameo from the bench to earn praise from Frank Lampard and offer Chelsea fans a glimpse of his quality.", "authors": ["Matt Barlow For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/19/19933458-0-image-a-55_1571509878330.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
