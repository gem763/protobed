Foster + Partners / Press Materials\n\nThe firm also proposed that an airport shuttle system would connect the two terminals.\n\nThe terminal itself would have a translucent structure, allowing sunlight to reach the inside of the building.\n\nIn addition, it would also incorporate a wooden finish and provide space to plant trees.\n\nGrimshaw's vision features an urban marketplace\n\nGrimshaw architects put forward the idea of an airport featuring a more of a \"hub\" feel.\n\nThe concept by Grimshaw. Press Materials\n\nTheir vision includes a reasonably proportioned airport that veers away from the excessive size of some more recently built connecting airports, with a view to reducing the time transfers take, and to shorten the walking distance for travelers.\n\nRead more: Beijing's new Daxing Airport will be the biggest in the world when it opens later this year. Here's what it looks like inside the impressive $12 billion construction project.\n\nAmong other factors, the use of natural light, the reduction of the airport's length, and the \"stacking\" of the terminals were at the core of Grimshaw's design.\n\nThough the design idea behind the terminal was focused on minimizing the stress associated with transfers, the architects also put forward the idea of incorporating a space for performances and events somewhere in the airport.\n\nChapman Taylor envisioned the CPK beneath a transparent dome\n\nThe aspect that stands out most in Chapman Taylor's design proposal is the transparent dome.\n\nIn this concept, the main part of the terminal located between the two runways would be covered with a glass construction, to symbolize \"infinite unity\".\n\nChapman Taylor's design proposal includes a transparent dome. Press Materials\n\nConsisting of six levels, the terminal would be comprised of railway platforms, a stopover area for train passengers, arrivals, departures, business lounges, and a mall area with shops and restaurants.\n\nRead more: The world's best airport just unveiled a $1.25 billion glass dome mall with a rainforest, waterfalls, and bejeweled clouds\n\nEach of them will be inspired by a different element of the country's landscape \u2014 the coast, the lakes, the lowlands, the highlands, the valleys, and the mountains.\n\nThe designers admitted they'd been somewhat inspired by the Jewel Changi Airport in Singapore, which incorporated a lot of natural greenery into its interior.\n\nIn each of Zaha Hadid Architects' three concepts of the CPK, the focus is on incorporating rail transport into the airport.\n\nZaha Hadid Architects proposed three similar visions for the new Polish airport.\n\nAs well as carefully thought out interior lighting, all three concepts would also include lush greenery.\n\nThe first concept features a railway line directly below the airport, theoretically allowing passengers on the upper floors to observe arriving and departing trains.\n\nZaha Hadid Architects' first concept. Press Materials\n\nThe firm's second vision features a station that would, instead, sit above platforms, which would connect other parts of the airport.\n\nZaha Hadid Architects' second concept. Press Materials\n\nThe third concept entails trains arriving directly at separate points across the terminals, which will be located on platforms at different heights.\n\nZaha Hadid Architects' third concept. Press Materials\n\nThe CPK would be bigger than Manhattan, based on Benoy's concept\n\nArchitects from Benoy explained that once built, the CPK would cover an area larger than the entirety of Manhattan.\n\nEssentially, the firm is not only putting forward a concept for the development of an airport; it's also proposing plans that will transform the surrounding area.\n\nThese outlying areas would eventually become various parts of the \"Airport City\" \u2014 from hotels and conference rooms to logistics centers and offices.\n\nBenoy said that, once built, their vision of the CPK would cover an area larger than the entirety of Manhattan. Benoy / Press Materials\n\nBenoy has suggested that, regarding the interior of the terminal, the boundaries between each zone should be as smooth, seamless, and invisible as possible.\n\nThe airport's official master plan, which will define its direction for its first 25 years, is to be drawn up and finalized by 2020.\n\nKPF studio's architectural concept for the CPK. CPK\n\nThe architects who came up with the idea for the triangle-shaped terminal have also worked on airports in Abu Dhabi, Amsterdam, and Seoul.\n\nThe shape is meant to ensure that the distances between the furthest points of the airport won't be too far, a common gripe of airport travellers these days.\n\nKPF studio's architectural concept for the CPK. CPK\n\n\"The triangular shape of the terminal is optimal from an architectural point of view and offers a lot of benefits. It offers convenient movement and reduces the time it takes for flight transfers,\" said architect Jens Hardvendel from KPF.\n\n\"The triangle is also a really nice shape, reminiscent of clasped hands \u2014 it's associated with solidarity, which will resonate a lot with many Polish people.\"\n\nAs well as the roof of the triangular hall being transparent, creating as much natural light as possible, there will also be skylights.", "description": "One architect proposing design concepts for the airport says the transport hub \"would cover an area larger than the entirety of Manhattan.\"", "authors": ["Ruqayyah Moynihan", "Marcin Walk\u00f3w", "Business Insider Polska"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d249d1aa17d6c041d719813-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
