History was immediately being rewritten when it came to this man who had just made the mistake of having an unnecessary referendum. Poor chap. Sorry, but this is just not the case. Cameron\u2019s self-belief deluded others into thinking that he stood for something other than himself.\n\nHe was ruthless, and his shininess hid the reality of what his ministers were doing: what his chancellor George Osborne, for instance, unleashed on ordinary people. The decimation of the public sector, the deliberate impoverishment of the already poor was a national disaster. It still is.\n\nBut not according to one George Osborne, who reviewed his mate Cameron\u2019s book in a newspaper he now edits. Osborne described the pair helplessly witnessing the referendum result \u2013 \u201can event that destroys our careers, wrecks our political project and (much more importantly) ends an era of political stability and rationality\u201d.\n\nTheir careers were not destroyed; they failed upwards. The national disaster had already happened and, in fact, fed into Brexit \u2013 the poisonous discourse whereby the poor are blamed for the sins of the rich was an ideological choice. Cameron and Osborne were finishing the Thatcherite policy of shrinking the state. Even the International Monetary Fund at the time warned about the repercussions of such austerity.\n\nThis rewriting of the recent past \u2013 the pretence that everything was going fine until the Tories gave in to their headbangers \u2013 is wrong. Cameron\u2019s one modernising move, equal marriage, cost nothing. That was the whole point.\n\nOsborne asks us to feel sorry for Cameron, who suffers for his innocent mistake. David is \u201cdistraught by what happened to the Britain he cared about\u201d. So am I, but it\u2019s the Britain in which we step over bodies in sleeping bags, the one that he is partly responsible for, that I care about.", "description": "George Osborne wants to rewrite history and pretend everything was fine until the vote.
