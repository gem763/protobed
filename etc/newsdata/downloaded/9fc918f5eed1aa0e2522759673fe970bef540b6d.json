Is he acting in our national interest? I would say the evidence is no.\u201d\n\nRice\u2019s book follows her journey from Washington, DC, where she was raised as one of the few African-American students in Washington\u2019s most elite and expensive schools, to her time as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford. After earning her Ph.D., she joined the Clinton administration and worked at the State Department as a 30-something \u201cwith a baby on my hip.\u201d A Brookings scholar during the Bush years, she joined President Barack Obama\u2019s administration at the outset, first as UN Ambassador, then as national security adviser.\n\nIt was during those years with Obama that Rice attended the 2015 White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner, where she first met the man who would succeed Obama in the Oval Office.\n\nDuring a break in the evening\u2019s program, as other guests milled about, Rice says she remained seated at her table. \u201cFrom behind me comes this hulking man, and [he] literally kind of lifts me up out of the chair. And I turn around and I recognized him \u2014 obviously, it\u2019s Donald Trump \u2014 and he grabs me and hugs me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to hasten to say, it wasn\u2019t a gross hug. But it was kind of creepy and strange because I didn\u2019t know him,\u201d said Rice. \u201cBut while he was hugging me, he whispered this into my ear: \u2018I want you to know you were treated very unfairly over Benghazi,\u2019 a phrase we\u2019ve heard him say \u2014 \u2018very unfairly.\u2019 He says it a lot; usually about himself, but in this case, it was about me, and that I was doing a good job for the country. And I thanked him, and it was a very pleasant exchange.\u201d\n\nA month later, in June 2015, Trump announced his presidential candidacy, \u201cand all of a sudden everybody and anybody who works for President Obama \u2014 and President Obama himself \u2014 were the devil incarnate,\u201d said Rice.\n\nRice says that during the 2016 presidential campaign, she considered publicly divulging Trump\u2019s comment to her. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to get in the middle of the politics of the campaign, so I kept it to myself,\u201d Rice said. \u201cI actually admit to regretting that some days now.\u201d\n\nTo hear more from Ambassador Susan Rice, listen to the full podcast here.
