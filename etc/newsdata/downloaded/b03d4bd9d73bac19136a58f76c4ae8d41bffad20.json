With its own true wireless Pixel Buds not due for release until next year, Google just offered every other headphone manufacturer a nice opportunity to capitalize on any new Pixel 4 owners who might not already own wireless headphones.\n\nEvery previous Pixel phone offered a wired headphone option in the box, whether via a traditional 3.5mm headphone jack, a bundled pair of USB-C headphones, or a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter. (The original Pixel and Pixel 3A had the built-in jack; the Pixel 3 came with both accessories.) This will be the first time Google has shipped a phone without any of those options.\n\nThe true wireless Pixel Buds aren\u2019t coming until next year\n\nThe lack of an adapter isn\u2019t going to be a problem for anyone who does plan to buy a pair of Google\u2019s true wireless Pixel Buds in 2020, though. They\u2019ll connect wirelessly to your phone, no adapter required.\n\nThe omission of even a 3.5mm adapter is sure to annoy some people. However, after an event where Google spent a significant amount of time talking about reducing the environmental impact of its products, it\u2019s not surprising that it would want to cut down on the amount of extra plastic it includes in the box with its phone. That said, Google says it\u2019s offering a $100 Google Store credit to buyers of the Pixel 4, which should be enough to pick yourself up a pair of USB-C earbuds or a 3.5mm adapter if you need one.", "description": "Google\u2019s latest phone, the Google Pixel 4, is breaking tradition with zero support for wired headphones in the box. And because Google\u2019s truly wireless Pixel Buds aren\u2019t due till 2020, it\u2019s leaving the door open for buyers to pick a competitor\u2019s wireless earbuds instead.", "authors": ["Jon Porter", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oCsjL-mDu4RQl3G2dUx5bGNSWls=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9685857/akrales_171114_2125_0248.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
