But, if the Liberal Democrat conference is anything to go by, it appears to Mr S that it might be those on the Remainer side of the political spectrum who have an unhealthy interest in empires across the world.\n\nGuy Verhofstadt, the Belgian MEP and Europhile certainly gave that impression yesterday, when he gave a speech at the Lib Dem conference in Bournemouth. In his speech, the MEP launched into an unprecedented rant about the state of the world, which he argued was dominated by \u2019empires\u2019. And, that Britain could only be protected from these scary \u2018empires\u2019, if it banded together with the European Union:\n\n\u2018The world of tomorrow is not a world order based on nation states or countries. It is a world order that is based on empires. China, is not a nation, it\u2019s a civilisation. India\u2026 is not a nation\u2026 The US is also an empire, more than a nation\u2026 And then finally the Russian federation. The world of tomorrow is a world of empires in which we Europeans, and you British, can only defend your interests, your way of life, by doing it together, in a European framework and in the European Union.\u2019\n\nEven more bizarrely, the Liberal Democrat members in the audience then decided to applaud this somewhat ahistorical rant.\n\nWatch here:", "description": "Watch: Guy Verhofstadt on the world\u2019s \u2018empires\u2019 on Coffee House | Supporters of Brexit are often accused by their political opponents of having an unhealthy\u2026", "authors": ["Douglas Murray", "Isabel Hardman", "Rod Liddle", "Richard Dawkins", "James Kirkup", "James Forsyth", "Charles Moore", "Nigel Villalard", "Colin Wheeler", "A J Singleton"], "top_image": "https://spectatorblogs.imgix.net/files/2019/09/Screenshot-2019-09-15-at-17.14.52.png?auto=compress,enhance,format&crop=faces,entropy,edges&fit=crop&w=2036&h=1346", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
