After all, the NRA has been the biggest bogeyman for anti-gun groups for years now, and anti-gun activists on social media have routinely called the NRA a terrorist organization for awhile now. It\u2019s sad, but not exactly shocking, to see that mentality adopted by many on the Left.\n\nBreaking down the poll results by age reveals that younger Americans are the least likely age group to consider the NRA a terrorist organization. 19% of those 18-24 completely agree with that label, compared to 24% of those 44-55 and 23% of those over the age of 55.\n\nGeographically, 30% of respondents in the northeast wholeheartedly agreed with the designation, while just 18% of those in the midwest concurred.\n\nInterestingly, according to YouGov, 25% of men agreed completely that the NRA is a terrorist organization, while just 21% of women felt the same.\n\nIt also appears wealth has an impact on how you feel about the NRA. According to the YouGov poll, 32% of those who earn more than $80k a year are on board with calling the NRA a terrorist organization, while just 20% of those making less than $40k agree.\n\nOf course the NRA isn\u2019t a terrorist organization, and its millions of members aren\u2019t terrorists. In fact, the NRA has a message to the San Francisco supervisors and those who agree with them.\n\nHere\u2019s a hint to help anti-gun Democrats determine the difference between a terrorist organization and a civil rights organization like the NRA. If major American cities welcome an organization with open arms and invite them back after 80,000 of its members descend on the community for a weekend, it\u2019s not a terrorist organization. If crime drops when members show up en mass, it\u2019s not a terrorist organization. When a group injects tens of millions of dollars into a community, instead of causing tens of millions of dollars in damage, it\u2019s not a terrorist organization.\n\nI suspect that most folks who are fine with calling the NRA a domestic terror organization are just using that as lazy shorthand for \u201cI really don\u2019t like this group\u201d, which is asinine. But if they really do believe that there are 5-million domestic terrorists running around, I\u2019d like to see some follow up polling to see how many Americans think NRA members should\n\nBe placed on a terror watch list\n\nBe surveilled by law enforcement\n\nBe banned from social media\n\nLose custody of their firearms\n\nLose custody of their children\n\nAfter all, if the NRA and its members are a bunch of terrorists, we can\u2019t have them running around all willy-nilly exercising their constitutional rights, can we?\n\nIt\u2019s both sad and scary that the moral panic over gun ownership has gotten to the point where a substantial number of Democrats are willing to declare millions of law-abiding Americans as \u201cterrorists\u201d simply because they disagree with them on the fundamental importance of the right to keep and bear arms. The truth is the moms and dads, veterans, law enforcement and first responders, teachers, pastors, accountants, firearms instructors, truck drivers, and more who make up the NRA\u2019s membership are the kind of folks who help their fellow Americans when terrorists attack their communities, be it a small town in Texas or the metropolis of New York City. The fact that so many anti-gun advocates can\u2019t tell or refuse to acknowledge the difference says a lot more about them than it says about the average NRA member.", "description": "In other news, nearly 1/2 of Americans have no idea what a terrorist organization actually looks like.", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/116/2a188fd0-9576-40a7-b322-80d995569476.png", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
