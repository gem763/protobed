REUTERS/Benoit Tessier\n\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney was speaking after hopes of a resolution to the tortuous three-year Brexit process were raised in recent days. Sterling shot up to a 2-month high on Thursday when European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said a deal was possible.\n\nCoveney repeated Juncker\u2019s sentiment but cautioned that the gap was still wide and he underscored the risks of a disorderly Brexit - civil unrest on the island of Ireland and a dislocation of trade.\n\n\u201cI think the mood music has improved,\u201d Coveney told BBC radio. \u201cWe all want a deal, we all know that a no-deal will be a lose, lose, lose for everybody, but particularly for Ireland and Britain.\n\n\u201cBut I think we need to be honest with people and say that we\u2019re not close to that deal right now. But there is an intent I think by all sides to try and find a landing zone that everybody can live with here.\u201d\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly said he wants to strike an amended deal at an EU summit on Oct. 17-18 but that if that is not possible then he will lead the United Kingdom out without a deal.\n\nCoveney said Johnson was serious about seeking a deal but that Dublin was still waiting for \u201cserious proposals\u201d. But he cautioned against political spin.\n\n\u201cEverybody needs a dose of reality here, there is still quite a wide gap between what the British government have been talking about in terms of the solutions that they are proposing, and I think what Ireland and the EU will be able to support.\u201d\n\nBritain said on Thursday it had shared documents with Brussels setting out ideas for a Brexit deal, but an EU diplomat described them as a \u201csmokescreen\u201d that would not prevent a disorderly exit on the Oct. 31 departure date.\n\n\u201cBIG GAP\u201d\n\nIreland is crucial to any Brexit solution. The 500 km (300 mile) land border between Ireland and the United Kingdom\u2019s province of Northern Ireland has always been the biggest stumbling block for an orderly Brexit.\n\nThe Withdrawal Agreement that former Prime Minister Theresa May struck in November with the EU says the United Kingdom will remain in a customs union \u201cunless and until\u201d alternative arrangements are found to avoid a hard border.\n\nBut many British lawmakers oppose the prospect of being bound to EU rules and customs duties that would prevent Britain doing its own trade deals and leave it overseen by EU judges. Johnson says the backstop is undemocratic and must be removed.\n\nCoveney, Ireland\u2019s second most powerful politician, said a no-deal could lead to civil unrest and undermine the fragile peace secured by a 1998 U.S.-brokered agreement to end deacdes of sectarian and political conflict in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u201cTrade across 300 road crossings that has created a normality and a peace that is settled on the island of Ireland for the last 20 years, that now faces significant disruption,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is what we\u2019re fighting for here.\n\n\u201cIreland is in no doubt as to what a no deal means for us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is very damaging, very difficult and it poses huge questions for politics and potentially for the management of civic unrest in the context of Northern Ireland, around the border question.\u201d\n\nJohnson also faces challenges on the home front. After three days of hearings which ended on Thursday, Britain\u2019s Supreme Court is due to rule early next week on whether he acted unlawfully when he suspended parliament for five weeks in the run-up to the departure date.\n\nIf the ruling goes against him, Johnson could be compelled to recall parliament ahead of schedule, giving the legislature additional time to challenge his plan to lead Britain out of the European Union on Oct. 31 with or without a divorce deal.", "description": "Britain and the European Union are not yet close to a Brexit deal that could resolve the Irish border riddle and London needs to come up with serious proposals, Ireland said on Friday.", "authors": ["Guy Faulconbridge", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431975245&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J0HZ", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
