There will be time for Parliament to consider the legislation and any amendments.\"\n\nAway from Westminster, Scotland's highest court will also consider the matter on Monday. It was asked earlier this month to sign a letter fulfilling the terms of the Benn Act on the prime minister's behalf if he failed to do so, but judges delayed giving a ruling to allow the political debate to play out.\n\nWhat does the opposition say?\n\nLabour, the SNP, Lib Dems and others roundly criticised Mr Johnson's decision to send two letters to the EU, calling it \"childlike\" and \"petulant\". They also suggested he may have broken the law - or at least tried to \"frustrate\" it.\n\nOn the deal itself, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC's Andrew Marr that Labour would seek to make changes to it, in particular backing an amendment requiring it to be put to another referendum - up against Remain.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Labour's Keir Starmer says Boris Johnson has been \"childlike\" with his unsigned letter\n\nHe said he believed that would most likely be tabled by a backbencher, but insisted: \"It's got to go back to the public.\"\n\nLabour had planned to vote against Boris Johnson's deal, arguing it would be bad for the economy, jobs, workers' rights and other areas such as the environment.\n\nSir Keir said the party would push for other changes when the bill was brought to Parliament, for example by demanding a UK-wide customs union with the EU and single market alignment, and ensuring there could not be a no-deal \"trapdoor\" at the end of the transition period if no free-trade agreement was reached with the EU.\n\nAnalysis: The Speaker's choice\n\nBy Jessica Parker, BBC political correspondent\n\nNot for the first time, it's all eyes on John Bercow. It'll be up to the Speaker whether or not to allow the government to introduce its meaningful vote.\n\nBut ministers also want to get the ball rolling on the legislation that's required to actually implement the deal. They say they have the numbers to get it done by 31 October, but many MPs, armed with a heady mix of ambitions and amendments, don't care nearly so much for such deadlines.\n\nThat is unless Brussels turns around and says it won't grant an extension after all (unlikely though that seems). Downing Street will hope EU leaders stay as tight-lipped as possible on that subject, for as long as possible, so there's greater pressure on MPs to back Mr Johnson's deal.\n\nWhat is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill?\n\nThe UK needs to pass a law to implement the withdrawal agreement - the part of the PM's Brexit deal that will take the country out of the EU - in UK law.\n\nIt has to secure the backing of a majority of MPs - and then of peers in the House of Lords. And a vote for the Brexit deal itself is no guarantee of a vote for the legislation required to implement it.\n\nThe bill gives legal affect to any agreed transition period and fulfils requirements on the rights of EU citizens in the UK after Brexit. It will also allow ministers to make \"divorce payments\" to the EU foreseen under the current deal.\n\nMPs will be able to vote on amendments - changes or add-ons - to the bill.\n\nIf the government cannot get the bill through Parliament the default legal position is that the UK cannot ratify the deal, and so would leave on 31 October without a deal. However, that is dependent on no extension beyond that date having been already agreed with the EU.", "description": "Boris Johnson wants \"a straight up-and-down vote\" as the Commons returns to action two days after its rare Saturday session.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/162AF/production/_109299709_78b2f9d1-afe6-4f75-b5cc-139df23cd4ed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
