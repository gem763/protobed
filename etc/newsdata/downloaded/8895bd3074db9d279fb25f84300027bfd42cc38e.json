(Noah K. Murray-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 New York Mets closer Edwin Diaz is really good at giving up home runs \u2014 and he\u2019s made it into the record books as a result.\n\nOn Friday night, Diaz tied a major-league record by surrendering his 14th homer in the ninth inning this season.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nFormer big-leaguer Francisco Rodriguez also allowed 14 ninth-inning homers in 2014 with the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nEdwin Diaz has now allowed 14 9th inning HR this season, tying Francisco Rodriguez (2014 with Brewers) for the most such HR allowed in a season in MLB history.\n\n\n\nThe Mets have now allowed 31 9th inning HR this season, the most such HR allowed by a team in MLB history. pic.twitter.com/wGCXij0guy \u2014 ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) September 7, 2019\n\nThe Mets were ahead 4-2 with one on and one out in the ninth before Diaz hung a slider that Philadelphia Phillies catcher J.T. Realmuto belted into the left-field seats for a game-tying two-run shot.\n\nDiaz, who threw his arms up as the ball sailed out of the ballpark, was booed off the mound after recording the final out of the inning.\n\nNew York ultimately defeated Philadelphia 5-4 on a walk-off walk by Mets first baseman Pete Alonso, making a winner out of the former All-Star Diaz \u2014 who is better known on social media these days as \u201cEdlose.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s been a lot of bad luck,\u201d Diaz claimed through an interpreter. \u201cSometimes I leave bad pitches over the plate and they just pop out and I get outs, but it\u2019s just been a little bit of bad luck. But I go out there every time and I just try to get outs because I know my stuff is pretty good.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nHmm\u2026\n\nBad luck.\n\nPretty good stuff.\n\nAnd yet, horrendous results.\n\nIn his first season with the Mets, Diaz has a 5.88 ERA, seven losses and seven blown saves in 52 innings. The 25-year-old lost his closer role, but was needed in the ninth on Friday with primary fireman Seth Lugo resting. Lugo had pitched in the previous two games and needed a day off. The Mets had also used lefty Justin Wilson, another option, in the eighth.\n\nSo in came Diaz.\n\nAnd \u2014 like so many other times in 2019 \u2014 the Mets\u2019 lead disappeared as a result.\n\n\u201cI just stay positive all the time,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cToday I thought I actually did a pretty good job, but it was just the one mistake that I made. I\u2019m just going to keep going out there and keep working.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019d think the results would dictate otherwise, yet Mets manager Mickey Callaway plans to keep using Diaz, who also briefly lost his closer role with the Seattle Mariners in 2017, in high-leverage situations.\n\nSo keep bracing for impact, Mets fans.\n\n\u201cDiaz has to be good for us to get to where we want to go,\u201d Callaway said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll continue to run him out there in those situations when Lugo\u2019s not available or Wilson\u2019s not available. And if he doesn\u2019t get the job done, then we won\u2019t get the job done.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to put your finger on (the homer issue). We\u2019re gonna continue to have faith in him and put him in situations because we have to to get where we want to go.\u201d\n\nDiaz was the signature offseason acquisition of first-year GM Brodie Van Wagenen. It cost the team top prospect Jarred Kelenic.\n\nCombined with the subpar performance of setup man Jeurys Familia (6.43 ERA) \u2014 signed to a three-year, $30 million deal \u2014 it has been an absolute disaster.\n\nDiaz was supposed to be the piece to get the Mets over the top in their question to make the playoffs. But he may end up being the piece that prevents them from reaching the postseason.\n\nHis fastball command has been poor. His slider has been ineffective. He has shown an inability to read swings.\n\nAnd sources have maintained that the pressure of playing in New York \u2014 and all the booing he\u2019s heard as a result of his implosions \u2014 has gotten to him.\n\nNevertheless, the Mets were able to make a winner out of Edwin Diaz on Friday night, celebrating their walk-off victory, of course, by ripping off Alonso\u2019s jersey.\n\nSomeway.
