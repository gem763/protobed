Herring (D) tweeted Friday. \u201cDisgusting, dangerous rhetoric from anyone, even worse from an elected official.\u201d\n\nOn the Senate floor with a gun on her hip, Republican says packing heat can deter violence\n\nChase said her campaign never approved that language, something the digital media firm that placed the ad disputes. She said she spent the weekend talking with officials from the Prosper Group, asking them to issue an apology and claim responsibility for the message.\n\nShe recorded at least one of those conversations. In it, a senior Prosper Group employee concedes that the campaign never signed off on the final version of the ad. Chase warned the firm that she would release the recording if the apology was not issued by noon Monday.\n\nThe firm rebuffed her request, and Chase provided the six-minute recording to The Washington Post.\n\nR. Scott Kline, a senior strategist with the Prosper Group, says in the call that the firm violated \u201cnormal protocol\u201d when it failed to provide the campaign with a final version of the ad before posting it on Facebook last week.\n\n\u201cThe ad did not go to you,\u201d Kline says in the recording. \u201cThat\u2019s just clear as day here. . . . You approved the original ad. . . . We thought you were approving the revised ad, which you obviously did not get. I would absolutely agree with you that the ball was dropped on that. I\u2019m not trying to sugarcoat that. I\u2019m not trying to make ex\u00adcuses for it. That happened.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the Prosper Group said the campaign had signed off on \u201cshoot down\u201d language for the \u201cwebsite landing page\u201d that accompanies the ad, where supporters can sign a petition. The firm said Kline did not know all the facts when he spoke to Chase.\n\n\u201cThe Prosper Group terminated its relationship with Virginia State Senator Amanda Chase (R-11) as of Sunday, September 22nd,\u201d the company said in an email. \u201cUnfortunately, State Senator Chase is misrepresenting the facts and refused to take ownership for language she approved, and by recording our staff without their knowledge, acted in bad faith.\u201d\n\nMoney flowing to Virginia legislative races from both sides of gun control issue\n\nChase\u2019s campaign manager, Philip Search, said the termination was mutual. He and Chase said they never saw or approved the \u201cshoot gun groups\u201d wording. They said they saw an earlier version reading: \u201cProtect your guns. I\u2019m not afraid to shoot down any attack from the anti-gun lobby because gun rights are women\u2019s rights.\u201d\n\nSearch said he asked for minor tweaks to that wording, including changing \u201canti-gun lobby\u201d to \u00ad\u201canti-gun groups.\u201d\n\nThe firm released an email that showed Chase approving something \u2014 \u201cApproved! Looks good\u201d \u2014 two hours before the ad went up Thursday evening, but it is not clear from the email what she was authorizing. Search said Chase was approving a landing page that did not include the problematic language \u2014 not the Facebook ad.\n\nChase said the episode has damaged her chances for reelection in November, when all 140 seats in the state legislature will be on the ballot. Republicans are defending razor-thin majorities in the Senate (20 to 19) and the House (51 to 48), with one vacancy in each chamber.\n\nChase is facing a challenge from political newcomer Amanda Pohl, a Democrat. Her district \u2014 suburban-rural territory south of Richmond \u2014 favors Republicans, but Democrats see an opening given the surge of Democratic activism triggered by President Trump\u2019s election. A string of controversies have dogged Chase\u2019s campaign, including a well-publicized argument with a police officer over parking at the Capitol.\n\nVirginia\u2019s \u2018off-off-year\u2019 elections were once sleepy. And then came Trump.\n\nThe ad went online early Thursday evening, while Chase was hosting a fundraiser. She said she did not see it until the next morning. As it happened, former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) was kicking off a three-day swing through the state to campaign for gun control.\n\nOutside NRA headquarters, Virginia Democrats focus on gun violence\n\nGiffords, who founded a gun-control group after surviving a 2011 assassination attempt, was stumping for Democrats along with former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe (D).\n\n\u201cThis past session, Senator Chase proudly talked about open carrying to intimidate supporters of the Equal Rights Amendment,\u201d said Joanna Belanger, the political director for Giffords. \u201cPassing the blame and tweaking her advertisements doesn\u2019t change the fact that Senator Chase is a state leader inciting hate and violence. This shameful behavior is the opposite of leadership and has no place in Virginia or anywhere else in the country.\u201d\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Sen.
