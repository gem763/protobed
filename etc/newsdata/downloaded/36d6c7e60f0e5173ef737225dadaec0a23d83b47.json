Perhaps a lot. Maybe nothing. I don\u2019t know, but during a recent tech conference, Musk addressed a few questions about the future of mankind, space travel and \u201cdem aliens\u201d that left people in the audience scratching their heads. First of all, is the U.S. Government hiding information about extraterrestrial species from the public? Nope. He also dissed Area 51, but I\u2019m pretty sure that part was just a joke. (Express.co.uk)\n\nThe tech mogul dismissed speculation about the US Government being in contact with aliens and covering up their existence from the public. He said: \u201cThere are people out there who think we have found aliens. Trust me, I would know: We have not. \u201cPeople ask me if I have been to Area 51. Ok, please. SpaceX actually has area 59 and it\u2019s eight better than area 51.\u201d Mr Musk also spoke out about the importance of future exploratory missions to Mars, particularly if something were to happen to the Earth.\n\nWhat exactly is going on here? I\u2019m really hoping this wasn\u2019t another example of him, er\u2026 \u201cindulging\u201d himself as he did on Joe Rogan\u2019s show before taking the stage. But let\u2019s give him the benefit of the doubt and say that he\u2019s not.\n\nIf Musk can state definitively that our government doesn\u2019t have any additional information about possible extraterrestrials visiting the Earth, how would he have come by this information? Granted, he\u2019s done a lot of work with NASA over the past decade and I\u2019m fairly sure he\u2019s even launched a few payloads for our military. But that doesn\u2019t mean that they would spill the beans on absolutely everything to him.\n\nThis is particularly true when you look at his late-night Twitter habits. He probably wouldn\u2019t be considered a very good security risk to handle beyond top-secret material, given his stream of consciousness social media rants. (Of course, I\u2019ve said the same thing about President Trump for the same reason. If Defense knows anything about aliens, I doubt they\u2019ve told him either.) Suffice to say that I\u2019m not ready to concede that Musk is the final authority on this question, whether he asks me to trust him or not.\n\nAs for the Area 51 thing\u2026 come on, man. That was just a joke. Area 59 is eight better than Area 51. (Okay\u2026 I didn\u2019t say it was a good joke.)\n\nThe last topic he touched on was an important one that we should all be considering, however, and I don\u2019t disagree with him. Musk is hardly the first person to suggest that we only have a limited window of technological supremacy, and if we\u2019re ever going to get off this rock and improve mankind\u2019s chances of lasting for the long run, this window may not be open for long. Whether it\u2019s a comet smashing into our planet or some catastrophe of our own making, we\u2019re not going to be at this point forever, assuming any of us even survive.\n\nGoing to Mars is a fun project and could produce a lot of good science, but we\u2019re never going to terraform that planet even if we had an interest in trying. Or at least we won\u2019t be able to do it in a useful amount of time. Getting viable populations of human beings to other Earth-like worlds is going to be a herculean task, but it\u2019s one we need to be investing in right now unless we want to throw in the towel and admit that human beings will eventually just be a footnote in cosmic history.\n\nYes, Musk can get a bit wacky at times, but he\u2019s no dummy. And he\u2019s right about the need to expand beyond the bounds of Earth if it\u2019s at all possible. I hope he keeps cooking up ideas and advancing aerospace technology. And maybe put down the bong for a while.", "description": "Does he have a point?", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MuskPoints.jpg"}
