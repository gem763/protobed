As he has controlled her with manipulative and gaslighting behaviour, she has become more reliant on her \u2013 and moves such as staging a burglary and hiding secret cameras have shown just how far he is prepared to go to eradicate Yasmeen\u2019s independence.\n\nAnd Alya Nazir (Sair Khan), who has had concerns about Geoff before, is about to infuritate him as it becomes clear that he has his eye on Speed Daal too. As Yameen and Geoff are run off their feet during a busy shift, he suggests they buy into the business, arguing that they do all the hard work anyway.\n\nYasmeen puts the suggestion to Alya \u2013 but is forced to relay to a fuming Geoff that she is happy for Yasmeen to invest but not for him. As he storms off, Yasmeen feels stuck in the middle but Geoff has another plan and contacts Zeedan about selling his share of the business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA smug Geoff tells an annoyed Alya that Zeedan is selling to him and as Alya asks Yasmeen if she really wants Geoff to be so invested in every part of her life, her gran replies that she is happy for Geoff to be on board. But does she mean it?\n\nGeoff already has his eye on making changes to the business and immediately suggests that they scrap the no alcohol policy to bring in more cash, leaving Alya furious. But as Geoff and Alya look set to go to war over the running of the business, it will be Yasmeen who suffers as Geoff inevitably takes his annoyances out on her.\n\nWill he seek to drive a permanent wedge between Yasmeen and her granddaughter? And will Alya figure out his game?\n\nOne to watch: Friday 18th October at 7:30pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Alya is worried about his sinister behaviour in Corrie.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/18_10_coro_yasmeen_alya_geoff_2nd_ep_02-9887_1569846354.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
