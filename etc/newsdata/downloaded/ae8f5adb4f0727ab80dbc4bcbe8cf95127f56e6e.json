"Falling another 20% behind the market finally toppled Woodford", "language": "en", "text": "In the end it was Neil Woodford\u2019s poor performance after his fund was frozen at the start of June that finally toppled him.\n\nEven with the protection of being able to operate behind closed doors, with savers unable to pull their cash, the fund manager woefully underperformed the stock market.\n\nThe only way of avoiding a renewed rush for the exit would have been if the fund had begun to do well while investors were stuck in it\n\nNo point continuing: The only way that Woodford investors would not have renewed their rush for the exit when the fund reopened was if it had outperformed - instead it slumped further\n\nYet from 31st May, the last day that investors \u2013 including yours truly - could withdraw money from Woodford\u2019s flagship Equity Income Fund, to when he was given the boot on Tuesday he lost them 17 per cent.\n\nOver the same period the FTSE All Share index rose 1.7 per cent.\n\nThe rot had set in long before this and Woodford was trying to salvage his operation rather than test his stock-picking skills, but losing investors almost 20 per cent compared to the stock market over four months was not a good look.\n\nThat poor performance meant that investors were still itching to get their money out of Woodford\u2019s fund as soon as it reopened.\n\nBarring some form of minor miracle, the situation was not going to be turned around by December and so the administrator, Link, kicked Woodford off the fund that bore his own name and appointed others to sell off its shareholdings and gradually return money to investors.\n\nIt shows how far the former star fund manager had fallen that the news had an air of inevitability about it.\n\nWhen Woodford\u2019s fund was frozen I wrote that, \u2018if investors are fortunate, the fund\u2019s investments will start going back up in value and being blocked from selling out will be good news.\u2019\n\nBack in early June, it was possible to envisage a scenario where the market turned in Woodford\u2019s favour while the shutters were pulled down.\n\nWere we now in a position where Woodford Equity Income was up 17 per cent and the stock market was down 2 per cent, they could have taken the risk of reopening the doors.\n\nI know from the emails that readers have sent me and the comments they have left that many were so furious with Woodford they still would have left on principle, but a pronounced bout of outperformance might have been enough to give a lot of others short memories.\n\nThat has manifestly failed to happen and while Woodford\u2019s defence has been to rely on the traditional value investor\u2019s appeal for patience, another old investing adage could be twisted to fit his situation: \u2018The market can remain irrational longer than your investors can remain patient\u2019.\n\nI stuck with Woodford in the period running up to the fund freeze, because I thought he would turn it around and I thought his investing experience would shine through and his judgement would be proved right.\n\nThe fund being frozen and what has happened since proved that was the wrong move.\n\nFrom the day that the shutters came down to the last price before it was announced it would be wound down, Woodford Equity Income lost investors another 17%\n\nI had only a small amount of my overall portfolio invested with Woodford and am down about \u00a3900 in total as things stand, with a 34 per cent fall in my Equity Income Fund holding and a 66 per cent decline in the Patient Capital trust shares I also hold.\n\nThe latter may bounce back under new management, but with the fund I expect to have lost more by the time it is fully wound up.\n\nI am fortunate and can stomach that, but the real victims of Woodford\u2019s sorry mess are those who trusted him with their money in the Equity Income Fund and cannot afford the losses his drift has delivered.\n\nThese are investors and pensioners who have lost thousands or tens of thousands of pounds.\n\nSome will argue that people should have been better diversified, put less faith in the likes of a commercial operation such as Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s best buy fund lists, or paid more attention to where their money was going.\n\nThose are all fair points, and Woodford made no secret of his more risky holdings, publishing a full list on his site.\n\nBut it is difficult for ordinary investors to properly investigate the kind of investments that became Woodford\u2019s hobby horse and he has been around long enough to know that all those billions of pounds did not flow in because savers fancied chasing biotech firms and university spin-outs.\n\nHis reputation as a big gun income fund manager, who made the right calls, was what tempted investors, not because they wanted to back a fund drifting off into venture capital territory.\n\nWoodford has let investors down very badly, particularly since the fund was frozen.\n\nOver the past four years, Woodford is estimated to have taken \u00a363million in dividends and profits from his firm and his business partner Craig Newman has taken \u00a337million.\n\nYet, despite that, Woodford Investment Management has raked in \u00a38.8million in fees from the Equity Income Fund since it was frozen and he has refused all calls to cut the charges.\n\nThose figures speak of hubris and greed.\n\nThey should also make us question some of the other megastar funds raking in big fees that we invest in: the last financial crisis gave rise to the mantra of \u2018too big to fail\u2019, with these huge funds the problem might be that they are too big to succeed.", "description": "In the end it was Neil Woodford's poor performance after his fund was frozen at the
