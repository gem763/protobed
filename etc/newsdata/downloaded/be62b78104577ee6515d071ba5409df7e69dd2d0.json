Marieke Vervoort of Belgium celebrates winning the bronze medal in the event. REUTERS/Jason Cairnduff/File Photo\n\nVervoort, who won Paralympic gold in the 100 metres wheelchair race in the London Games in 2012, had signed euthanasia papers in 2008 in Belgium, where it is legal, and died in accordance with her wishes late on Tuesday.\n\nVervoort, who also won silver medals in London and at Rio in 2016, was diagnosed with the painful condition as a teenager and retired from competition after the Rio Games. She advocated dialogue on assisted dying in countries around the world.\n\nSpeaking in Rio in 2016, she said \u201cThis is my last Paralympic Games. I have a progressive disease and I signed my euthanasia papers already, in 2008, because it\u2019s really, really hard to handle, and to suffer with this disease.\u201d\n\nHaving the papers that would permit her to choose euthanasia gave her peace of mind, she said, adding: \u201cI hope euthanasia is also something for every country that it means - not murder - that it means giving a feeling of rest to people.\u201d\n\nVervoort told reporters at the Rio Paralympics that, without the papers she would probably have already committed suicide because \u201cit\u2019s very hard to live with so much pain and suffering and this unsureness.\u201d\n\nShe spoke candidly of the loss of her physical abilities and the ability to draw and the reduction of her eyesight. \u201cWhat is the next thing coming? I am really scared. But those papers give me a lot of rest in my mind because I know when it\u2019s enough for me, I have those papers.\u201d\n\nBut she added, \u201cI am still alive and still going to enjoy every little, little moment of my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarieke \u2018Wielemie\u2019 Vervoort was an athlete of iron strength and a great lady. Her death affects us deeply,\u201d Belgium\u2019s royal family said on Twitter, using her nickname \u2018Wielemie\u2019, a reference to the wheels of her wheelchair.\n\nThe town of Diest in northern Belgium, where Vervoort was born, set up a book of condolence and carried a long message on its website.\n\n\u201cDespite her physical limitations she had a impressive sporting career,\u201d the town said. \u201cMarieke chose euthanasia a few years ago and followed through on her choice on Tuesday evening.\u201d\n\nLocal poet Kristien Nys also penned some lines to the \u201csilver-plated, gold-plated\u201d Vervoort with an iron will and \u201cangelic patience\u201d. Vervoort\u2019s smile would no longer be seen.\n\n\u201cBut your pain is also gone, you have done your last lap, you have waited long enough, your big battle has been fought.\u201d", "description": "Belgian Paralympian Marieke Vervoort died by euthanasia on Tuesday aged 40 after a battle with an incurable and degenerative spinal condition which she described after winning her medals as becoming harder and harder to bear.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444077150&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0V9", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
