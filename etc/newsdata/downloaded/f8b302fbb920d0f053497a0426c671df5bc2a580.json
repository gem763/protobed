In the Free State that proportion was 27.7%, and in the Northern Cape it was 27.5%.\n\nThat was even after average rentals grew by 6.58% year on year in the Free State in the second quarter, after increasing by 8.4% in the first quarter, the biggest jump in any province this year.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "According to the PayProp index average rental prices in Limpopo and the Northern Cape are still dropping, while the cheapest rents in South Africa, in the North West, are climbing well above inflation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7678/a95f9f67e94f4fc98a4a8bba64f99f2a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-19"}
