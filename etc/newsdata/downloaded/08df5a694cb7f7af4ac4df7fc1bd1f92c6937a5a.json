He wants to take private property from millions of law-abiding Americans. Bob is anti-gun. And he proudly said \u201chell yes\u201d to confiscating so-called assault weapons. He\u2019s the liberal who thinks the AR-15 is a scary gun. Americans own millions of these rifles. There is no way compliance for confiscation will be honored. It\u2019s illegal. It\u2019s unconstitutional. And if Democrats want to follow the playbooks of never winning another presidential race for the foreseeable future, follow this guy\u2019s lead. Liberals have short memories. Gun control already cost them the 2000 election, with Gore losing West Virginia, Tennessee, and Arkansas over his stance on gun control. Those states, even with Bush winning Florida, would have been enough to push Gore past 270 and succeed Bill Clinton in January of 2001.\n\nSo, whom does Bob (aka Beto) think should be trusted to own firearms in America? You guessed it; only the police, military, and other agents of the state should be allowed to own guns. And did I mention that he made this pitch at Kent State University, where the National Guard shot and killed four students in 1970 during a Vietnam War protest (via Reason):\n\nOf all the places to argue that only the government should be trusted with guns, Beto O'Rourke picked\u2026Kent State University. [\u2026] Invoking armed agents of the state gunning down unarmed civilians is an interesting way to argue that Americans would be better off if the government forcefully disarmed private citizens. But hey, I guess that's why we keep being told Beto's an \"unconventional\" candidate. [\u2026] As J.D. Tuccille pointed out last month, there's scant evidence to suggest that such a policy could be implemented effectively, and it's pretty unclear how O'Rourke would get gun owners to comply with the law. When New Jersey implemented a similar policy in the early 1990s, the state obtained a mere 18 guns of the estimated 100,000 to 300,000 firearms owned by Garden State residents\u2014and only four were turned over voluntarily. [\u2026] O'Rourke's plan to take guns out of private citizens' hands would not have prevented the Kent State massacre. But it would create lots of new opportunities for agents of the state to point guns at Americans who aren't a threat to anyone.\n\nBut that\u2019s exactly the point, right? The Democratic Party is a far-left cuckoo\u2019s nest, where they think they can spend trillions of Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, and free college without destroying the economy. This is a Marxist goodie bag\u2014and death is the end result. Yet, the details of the Green New Deal and the Left\u2019s overall environmental ethos aren\u2019t different from their socio-economic agenda. It\u2019s grounded in authoritarianism. In fact, the Left as of now is that party. You will be made to care. You will be made to turn over your guns, pay extreme taxes for shoddy health care, and cannibalize the economic future of your family to save the Earth. You will do this. It\u2019s mandatory. The Left\u2019s policies are so great\u2026that you must have a gun held to your head to ensure total compliance because D.C. and urban-based elite knows what\u2019s best for you, so why even bother with other views.\n\nAll institutions must be broken to the will of the state. The U.S. Constitution has to be shredded for this to be achieved, by the way\u2014and you bet liberal American would just love to toss a document, which they think is racist, in the trash It does get in the way of the Left\u2019s progressive paradise where the oppressive weight of the state is on everyone and the only thing that\u2019s equal in this society is the suffering that\u2019s inflicted on everyone. The Democrats think only agents of the state can be trusted with guns because these are the folks that will enforce their will. It\u2019s not hard.\n\nThis is at the core of American leftism. It's utter rot\n\nOnly government being trusted with firearms is the hallmark every other authoritarian regime that\u2019s ever existed. And yet, the odd thing is that these same people who think that only the police/military should only be the ones with guns, also think that law enforcement is racist and maybe they should be disarmed in a shamefully transparent ploy to gin up minority voter support. Pick a narrative, liberals. You cannot have it both ways. And certainly, the site of a national trauma where the brutality of the state was showcased isn\u2019t the best idea to pitch such a proposal unless you have no shot at winning and are past the point of \u201cscrew it\u201d regarding your campaign\u2019s life. Bob might be at that point, though he did get some more oxygen with this radical proposal as people are still talking about him for now.", "description": ".09/28/2019 6:11:44AM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/266/01c44d5e-eb6d-4d92-9297-0e1c7ae1cd4c.png", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
