Check out the trailer above, then catch the rest when Silicon Valley returns for one final round on Sunday, October 27, at 10 p.m.", "description": "HBO released a teaser trailer today for the sixth and final season of comedy series \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d which returns in October.", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/16/16-silicon-valey.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
