Mr. Elgort plays the adult Theodore Decker, who as a young boy loses his mother in a terrorist bombing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, \u201crescues\u201d the priceless painting of the title, and grows up to be a dealer in counterfeit antiques. Mr. O\u2019Hare, one of New York\u2019s acting treasures, is \u201ca prize Upper East Side swish named Lucius Reeve\u201d\u2014as described in Donna Tartt \u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel\u2014to whom Theo has sold an alleged Thomas Affleck Chippendale-style chest-on-chest.\n\nIt isn\u2019t an earth-shaking scene, or one that propels the narrative in any particularly urgent way. But as you watch two solid actors spar across a table at the Harvard Club, you realize\u2014if you\u2019ve been awake\u2014that electricity is possible. And how badly it\u2019s been missing from this movie.\n\n\u201cThe Goldfinch\u201d is directed by John Crowley, who has made three gems\u2014\u201cBrooklyn,\u201d \u201cBoy A\u201d and \u201cIntermission.\u201d Here, he\u2019s working from a script by Peter Straughan that strays wildly from the things that prompted some very kind critics to dub Ms. Tartt\u2019s book \u201cDickensian\u201d\u2014namely, a relentlessly linear structure, and a first-person account of an Upper East Side schoolboy\u2019s tragic-cum-checkered history.\n\nElsewhere, Mr. Straughan remains faithful to the book when he should be committing adultery. Chunks of original dialogue land like bricks. While there was never a storyline as much as a collection of vignettes, they all seem to be here, albeit distilled, reduced and chronologically rearranged in a way that precludes any narrative momentum. Or one\u2019s arrival in an emotionally satisfying place.\n\nAnsel Elgort Photo: Warner Bros. Entertainment\n\nWhat\u2019s terrific about \u201cThe Goldfinch\u201d is the casting. From the time the book was published 2013, readers were probably imagining Nicole Kidman in the role of Samantha Barbour, the Park Avenue art collector, socialite and mother of four who has Theo ( Oakes Fegley ) thrust upon her and her household after the boy has scrambled out of the blasted Met and gone home to wait for his mother, Audrey ( Hailey Wist ), who never arrives. Ms. Kidman is just as brittle, and as reservedly warm, as her character was on the page. Jeffrey Wright, too, is perfect as James \u201cHobie\u201d Hobart, the restorer of antiques with whom Theo will live (and from whom he receives, without quite absorbing, a sense of moral rightness). Likewise, Finn Wolfhard, the young \u201cStranger Things\u201d actor who plays Theo\u2019s friend Boris, the real engine of the chaos to come involving that eponymous 1654 masterpiece by Carel Fabritius (which in reality is safe and sound in the Mauritshuis in The Hague).\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say whether some credit is actually due to Mr. Crowley for some of the jarringly insincere aspects/performances in the film, though one could argue they reflect either the geography or the nature of the characters themselves. \u201cThe Goldfinch,\u201d after all, is a story, and a movie, in love with New York: The time Theo spends with the collected Barbours (including Boyd Gaines \u2019s gleefully mad Chance Barbour ) is not long, but it\u2019s paradisiacal\u2014the fondest, sweetest memory of his life, outside of his mother. When his shifty, abusive, alcoholic father, Larry ( Luke Wilson ), and dad\u2019s trashy girlfriend, Xandra ( Sarah Paulson ), finally arrive to take him off to Vegas, Theo\u2019s farewell to the collected Barbours on an Upper Manhattan street is the most poignant moment in the film. Mr. Crowley\u2019s Vegas, on the other hand, consists of a nightmarishly ugly housing development being reclaimed by the desert.\n\nNicole Kidman and Oakes Fegley Photo: Warner Bros. Entertainment\n\nWhile there\u2019s not exactly a lot of plot in \u201cThe Goldfinch\u201d there is a lot of stuff, too much for even a 2 1/2 -hour movie. (Would a Netflix/Hulu/Amazon multichapter adaptation have solved the compression problem? Maybe.) But so it goes with book adaptations. If a novel sells enough copies, it invariably becomes a movie, whether or not it\u2019s well-suited to film. And the screenwriter is obliged to include as much of the original content as possible\u2014because who, after all, is being catered to? The people who already bought the book and read it, who didn\u2019t read the book but meant to, or who bought the book and never got through it. There are many who\u2019ve done that. May they have better luck with the movie.\n\n\u2014Mr. Anderson is a Journal TV critic.
