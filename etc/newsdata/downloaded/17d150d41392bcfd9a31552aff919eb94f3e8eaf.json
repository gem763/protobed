I think there are great opportunities for us going forward to strengthen ties between big and small business.\"\n\nProductivity not fiscal stimulus\n\nPicked from among the BCA's board which includes Qantas CEO Alan Joyce, Coca-Cola Amatil CEO Alison Watkins and Woodside Petroleum CEO Peter Coleman, Mr Reed rejected the need for any wholesale shake-up at the BCA.\n\nHe said most of the BCA's policy positions would continue to evolve, including their view the government needed to focus on lifting productivity, regulation and skills ahead of unleashing a major fiscal stimulus package.\n\n\"The government needs to be taking a medium term approach to making sure the policy settings are right to lift investment,\" Mr Reed said.\n\n\"The government has fought hard to get a surplus, they went to the election campaigning on the fact they would deliver a surplus,\" he said.\n\nInsiders said Mr Reed became the obvious choice after standing down at MYOB after 16 years as CEO this year, previously holding senior roles in sales, marketing, product and business development at a range of tech companies.\n\nMr Frydenberg lauded outgoing president Mr King for his \"significant contribution\" including his focus on regional communities.\n\nMr Reed is expected to be formally elected as the 18th BCA president at the BCA's AGM on November 20, which is followed by the group's annual dinner where Mr Morrison is expected to speak.", "description": "The next president of the Business Council of Australia has a shaved head, doesn't wear ties and will be the first boss of the chief executives' lobby group aged under 50.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3393%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_281%2C$y_158/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/85b83e3af1e874a50ef5fa09d45bfc73007bb747", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
