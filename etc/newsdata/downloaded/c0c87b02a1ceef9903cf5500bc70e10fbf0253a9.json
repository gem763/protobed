An outspoken young woman who doesn\u2019t quite fit in with polite English society, Alice jumps at the chance to leave her native England when a handsome American proposes. Imagining a different sort of life altogether, she ends up with Bennett Van Cleve and his overbearing father in a rural town in Depression-era Kentucky. She\u2019s friendless, miserable and trapped.\n\nUntil, that is, the Pack Horse Library initiative comes to her town, offering her an escape from the lonely monotony of her days. Saddling up to bring books to remote families hungry for reading material, Alice and a cluster of local women join the initiative.\n\nAccording to an article in Smithsonian magazine - which inspired Moyes to set her historical novel in eastern Kentucky - the Pack Horse Librarians were the bookmobiles of the Great Depression. Overcoming danger and discomfort, they traversed seasons, mountains and miles to bring books to homes and schools that would otherwise go without.\n\nWhile her novel is set in the midst of the Great Depression, Moyes crafts a tale that\u2019s remarkably contemporary. One timely theme that runs throughout the book is the importance of facts. The librarians represent knowledge - knowledge they wish to share not just to open people to new worlds and ideas but also to arm them with the facts they need to counter the disinformation campaigns promoted by the wealthy and powerful.\n\n\u201cKnowledge is so important, don\u2019t you think? We all say at the library, without facts we really do have nothing,\u201d Alice says. And when her father-in-law attacks Alice for reading a \u201cfilthy book,\u201d he smugly informs her that the book has been banned. Her response? \u201cYes, and I know that a federal judge overturned that same ban. I know just as much as you do, Mr. Van Cleve. I read the facts.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental degradation is another recurring theme. And while Moyes never labels her character Margery O\u2019Hare as an environmentalist, her love and respect for the mountains that she calls home fuels her efforts to protect it from the degradation inflicted by the coal mines. \u201cA certain kind of man looked at God\u2019s own land,\u201d Margery thinks as she discovers newly desecrated forest, \u201cand instead of beauty and wonder, all he saw was dollar signs.\u201d\n\nThe fiercely independent Margery, \u201cwho would be owned by nobody, and told by nobody,\u201d is the ringleader of the librarians and in many ways is Alice\u2019s savior. \u201cYou\u2019re like a prisoner sprung from jail most mornings,\u201d she says to Alice, and allows her to see that she isn\u2019t as trapped as she thinks she is.\n\nInspired by the history of the actual Pack Horse Librarians, Moyes depicts the courage and resourcefulness of these women in loving detail. \u201cThe Giver of Stars\u201d is a tribute not just to the brave women who brought the light of knowledge in dark times, but also to the rejuvenating bond of women\u2019s friendship.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttps://www.jojomoyes.com/\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "\"The Giver of Stars: a Novel\" (Pamela Dorman Books), by Jojo Moyes", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Genine Babakian"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/07/book_review_-_the_giver_of_stars_81707_c0-852-1838-1923_s1770x1032.jpg?04cabd3547bba2fd63d33867cbe4a9706a2cd8aa", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
