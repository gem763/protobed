He repeated the sentence at least six times. At first, people laughed, then some asked him to shut up,\u201d a witness said.\n\nThere, he got up from his chair and shouted, \u2018Allah hu Akbar.\u2019 People then got up in a panic, ran to the exits, but the doors were blocked. Some were crying. A mother was looking for her daughter,\u201d the witness added.\n\nThe man yelling \u201cAllah hu Akbar\u201d managed to escape the cinema after other moviegoers tried to detain him. Police later arrested him in the nearby tenth arrondissement. He was detained in custody on suspicion of \u201capologising for terrorism\u201d.\n\nBy Monday evening, his detention had been lifted \u201cfollowing a review of behaviour\u201d a judicial source told Le Parisien.

And there were only a few dozen spectators who panicked. Besides, the others stayed to see the film to the end,\u201d Grand Rex management said.\n\nThe cinema\u2019s management went on to praise \u201cthe reactiveness of spectators who, with vigil, tried to surround the individual while waiting for the police\u201d.\n\nPolice say that they were still hunting for the other suspect and noted that some thieves used the panic to try and steal belongings from bags during the incident.\n\nThe incident is just the latest in a long line of events in which \u201cAllah hu Akbar\u201d has been yelled, including terrorist attacks and other acts of violence.\n\nIn January, a 43-year-old Moroccan migrant armed with a firearm yelled the phrase in Montpellier before being disarmed by a waitress at a local restaurant.\n\nIn July, in the department of Eure, the phrase was used by a group of up to 15 youths who proceeded to attack a local police station with various projectiles.\n\nStrasbourg Terror Suspect Yelled \u2018Allahu Akbar\u2019 During Attack, Has 27 Prior Criminal Convictions https://t.co/A1hPTIzO4e \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 12, 2018", "description": "Police arrested a man yelling \"Allah hu Akbar\" in a Paris cinema during the screening of\u00a0Joker\u00a0after his actions caused panic.", "authors": ["Chris Tomlinson"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/joker-joaquin-phoenix-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
