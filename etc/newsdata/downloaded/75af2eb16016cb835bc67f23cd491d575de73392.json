Though the actress gave an exclusive statement to PEOPLE at the time saying she was \u201cglad\u201d people thought she looked different, she has since admitted the toll the speculation took on her.\n\nOn particularly \u201cpainful\u201d moment came when she was on the London subway and a man sitting next to her started talking to the two women he was with.\n\n\u201cThey were talking about Hollywood and how Hollywood ladies are so silly, especially that Ren\u00e9e Zellweger,\u201d Zellweger, now 50, told SiriusXM\u2019s Jess Cagle during a Town Hall session.\n\nRELATED: Ren\u00e9e Zellweger Says \u2018Humiliation\u2019 Over Plastic Surgery Speculation Was the \u2018Hardest Kick\u2019 to Her Ego\n\n\u201cHow could she do that? Why would she go and have surgery on her face like we wouldn\u2019t know? She doesn\u2019t look like herself, and you can\u2019t just do that where you go and don\u2019t look like yourself, \u2018cause we expect you to look like yourself,\u201d Zellweger recalled the man saying.\n\n\u201cAnd I thought, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s interesting. Anyway, here\u2019s my stop,\u2019 \u201d Zellweger continued. \u201cSo I get up and I stand next to the door waiting for it to open and the man is still talking about how stupid I am. And he looked up and he said, \u2018Oh God, you\u2019re not \u2014 you are! Oh my God, but you look just like yourself!\u2019 And I said, \u2018Yeah, it\u2019s funny how that works, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u201c\n\nZellweger said the moment stung, but she was able to move past it without letting it affect her daily life.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only momentarily where you go, \u2018Jeez, wow, that\u2019s pretty painful.\u2019 But I don\u2019t live in that,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt just visits my life here and there and I\ufffd\ufffdm not really privy on that stuff until someone sends it to me. I don\u2019t seek it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m busy! You know, I have dogs and they have to have shots and they need pills twice a day. There\u2019s a lot, you know. I have other things to do,\u201d the actress joked.\n\nEarlier this month, Zellweger, who has been garnering Oscar buzz for her turn as Judy Garland in the upcoming biopic Judy, told New York Magazine in that the experience actually helped free her.\n\n\u201cNothing like international humiliation to set your perspective right!\u201d she said. \u201cIt clarifies what\u2019s important to you. And it shakes off any sort of clingy superficiality \u2026 that you didn\u2019t have time for anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the fears that maybe, as artists, we all share \u2014 because we have this public experience of being criticized not just for our work but as human beings \u2014 is when it gets to be too much, when you learn that your skin is not quite as thick as you need it to be, what is that gonna feel like? Well, now I know,\u201d Zellweger added. \u201cI got the hardest kick. And it ain\u2019t the end.\u201d\n\nJudy hits theaters Sept. 27.", "description": "Renee Zellweger on 'Painful' Moment Stranger Insulted Her Appearance", "authors": ["Ale Russian"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rUPT58by1V3HpCljsXqbUw--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/0bdf73c62ffad58c11bcbd9b691ab131", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
