There\u2019s no question we have a lot more conveniences at our disposal. The big question is: Are companies abusing the market power that they have gained,\u201d Delrahim said.\n\nDelrahim reportedly summed up his operating philosophy a few moments later, saying: \u201cBig is not bad. Big behaving badly is bad.\u201d\n\nNotably, Delrahim said it was not his job to be worried about whether breaking up America's biggest tech firms would help China to gain market shares.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt have all made that nationalist appeal in defense of Silicon Valley.\n\n\"Consideration of national champions is inappropriate,\" Delrahim said.", "description": "The country's top prosecutor probing Big Tech left the door open to breaking up the biggest names in Silicon Valley.", "authors": ["Christopher Carbone"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/William-Barr-amazon.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
