His presence will always loom over Nantes and the darkest period of the French club's history is still ongoing.\n\nBut on the pitch, the players are giving everyone connected to the club something to smile about.\n\nThey are second in the Ligue 1 standings, two points behind PSG after reeling off six wins in their first nine games and are flourishing under the guidance of Christian Gourcuff - father of ex-France midfielder Yoann - who took over the Brittany club as they began their first full season without Sala.\n\nChristian Gourcuff, father of ex-France midfielder Yoann, took over the Brittany club in August\n\nIn simple footballing terms, Sala's departure to Cardiff was always going to lead to a restructuring on the pitch.\n\nThe Argentine striker top-scored for Nantes three seasons in a row and had 13 in the campaign he played before his move to Cardiff and the tragedy that followed.\n\nOff the pitch, Nantes are embroiled in a dispute with Cardiff over the payment of the first instalment, worth \u00a35.3m, of Sala's transfer.\n\nFIFA ruled in September that the Welsh side must pay it but Cardiff responded by saying they were not liable for any of the fee because Sala was not officially their player.\n\nNantes will have to wait for closure but it is in times such as this where football can provide a welcome escape.\n\nEmiliano Sala died when a plane transporting him to Cardiff went down in the English Channel\n\nPeople were quick to leave tributes to Sala outside Nantes' stadium in the aftermath of the tragedy and his shadow will hang over the club for a long time\n\nThe 64-year-old Gourcuff has tightened the defence with a 4-4-2 formation and the difference is remarkable - in their first nine games of last season, under Vahid Halilhodzic, Nantes shipped 14 goals, picking up just nine points.\n\nThey scored 12 in those games - including four from Sala - but a leaky defence left them adrift of the league leaders early on. Things are different now - they have only conceded five times so far in the league.\n\nThat has been due in no small part to the imperious form of Nicolas Pallois in central defence with Andrei Girotto.\n\nThe form of Pallois has attracted talk, albeit jokingly, of a France call up at the ripe old age of 32.\n\nAt the other end though, Nantes have only scored nine times and five of their six wins have been by a 1-0 scoreline.\n\nTen teams have scored more goals than Nantes but only PSG and surprise package Reims have conceded fewer with four apiece.\n\nGourcuff has deployed a 4-4-2 formation that has seen his side surge to second in Ligue 1\n\nNantes' success is due in part to the imperious form of Nicolas Pallois (right) in central defence\n\nAfter Didier Deschamps announced his squad to face Iceland and Turkey for their important Euro 2020 qualifiers, Pallois announced his tongue-in-cheek international retirement on Twitter, having never made an appearance for France.\n\nDeschamps was questioned about the 'decision' to leave out Pallois and answered in the same tone: 'It is a blow for him. I take that with a smile.\n\n'He is very successful with his club,' he added more seriously before wishing Nantes further success this season.\n\nPallois has developed a strong partnership with midfielder-cum-defender Andrei Girotto (R)\n\nA partnership with Girotto was formed after Pallois got off to a rocky start against Lille on the opening day of the season, swiping at a cross that allowed Victor Osimhen - who's now the league's top goalscorer - to smash home a second goal in the game that ended 2-1 in Christophe Galtier's side's favour.\n\nPallois was joined by Molla Wague in central defence but wily Gourcuff opted to drop Girotto, who's normally a defensive midfielder, back into defence for Marseille away - after he started in the centre of the park at Lille.\n\nIt worked. Nantes managed a 0-0 draw and the partnership has held firm since, shipping just three goals in seven games.\n\nWhile Pallois and Girotto have been rocks at the back, it has been the work as a unit that has carved out results for Nantes.\n\nNantes' Nigerian forward Moses Simon (2nd R) celebrates after scoring against OGC Nice\n\nHe also came off the bench at Amien with less than 20 minutes left, scoring immediately\n\nLast week they needed him again against Nice, and he notched with four minutes to spare\n\n'We leave very few possibilities of counter-attacks for the opponent. Pallois and Girotto are very complementary players. When we are solid collectively, in the recovery of the ball, individually we are also powerful then,' mused Gourcuff in a recent post match press conference.\n\nHe also lauded the defence from the front, praising 'the harassment of the two attackers that prevent the first stimulus of opponents.'\n\nAnother success story is young goalkeeper Alban Lafont. Since arriving on loan from Fiorentina, the 20-year-old has been excellent, albeit after a shaky start where he conceded twice against Strasbourg.\n\nSince that game last month he has kept three clean sheets in a row.\n\nAnother success story is young goalkeeper Alban Lafont, who has kept six clean sheets\n\nNANTES IN LIGUE 1 THIS SEASON Played: 9 Won: 6 Drawn: 1 Lost: 2 For: 9 Against: 5 Points: 19 (two behind PSG)\n\nAgainst Patrick Viera's Nice last time out, Lafont only faced two shots on target, paving the way for forward Moses Simon to head home in the dying embers of the game after good wing play from Kader Bamba. It finished 1-0 to Nantes.\n\nAgainst Lyon, on the rare occasion that Pallois at centre back was found wanting, Memphis Depay broke in behind the Nantes rearguard but Lafont managed to stop the Dutchman's shot with his feet, something he did again against a Bertrand Traore effort later on.\n\nHe saved all seven shots on target that he faced.\n\nLyon left back Fernando Marcal was unlucky with a double deflection that looped over his own keeper as the Brazilian tried to tackle Samuel Moutoussamy in the box on 58 minutes. Nantes again won the game 1-0.\n\nSamuel Moutoussamy (pictured) created the goal against Lyon with a mazy run into the box\n\nThe Lyon bout was testament to the resolve of Nantes, given that Depay and Moussa Dembele have 10 goals in nine games between them this season, despite Lyon struggling.\n\nNantes have won three matches on the trot 1-0 now, against Rennes, Lyon then Nice, and have also overcome Montpellier and Reims by a solitary goal.\n\nAll bar one of their nine Ligue 1 goals have come after half-time, four in the final 20 minutes of the game. Their season has been an exercise in playing every minute of the game with total concentration.\n\nThe only time they did score in the first half of a game was away to Strasbourg, but Thierry Laurey's side went on to win the match with an 89th-minute penalty after levelling on 66 minutes.\n\nAbdoulaye Toure (R) and Malian forward Kalifa Coulibaly celebrate after beating Rennes\n\nThe late goals of Nigerian striker Moses Simon have also been pivotal for the Brittany side grabbing points.\n\nHe came off the bench at Amien in late August with less than 20 minutes left, scoring almost immediately to give his side the three points in a rare game where they scored more than once.\n\nLast week they needed him again against Nice, and he notched with four minutes to spare. Combined with the efforts of top scorer Kalifa Coulibaly, who has three, the pair have been silently formidable.\n\nAlgerian midfielder Mehdi Abeid and Coulibaly during the game against Rennes in September\n\nGourcuff is seen as a shrewd tactician in France, proved throughout his time at Lorient over three spells and two stints with Rennes.\n\nHe has never managed a team to the Ligue 1 title so his greatest success is arguably his third spell with Nantes' fellow Bretons Lorient - whom he managed for 11 seasons from 2003.\n\nWithin three seasons Gourcuff took the side out of Ligue 2 and led them to a string of excellent finishes, including 7th in the 2009-10 season, with the likes of Laurent Koscielny, Morgan Amalfitano and Kevin Gameiro at his disposal.\n\nLaurent Koscielny, a pupil of Gourcuff's at Lorient, battles with Lyon's Lisandro Lopez in 2010\n\nGourcuff managed this on a meagre budget, something that led his star pupil, Gameiro - who scored 43 goals in two seasons for the club - to the exit door.\n\nBut rebuilding a squad after bigger sides come knocking is a task that faces all managers at some point in their tenures. There is, sadly, a unique mood at Nantes that only time can lift, despite Gourcuff's impressive beginning.\n\nNantes play bottom-placed Metz at home on Saturday October 19.", "description": "It is nine months since the death of Emiliano Sala.
