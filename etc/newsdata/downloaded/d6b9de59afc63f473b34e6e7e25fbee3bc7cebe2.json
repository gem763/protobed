Cheers.\n\nSteve McManaman - Liverpool to Real Madrid, 1999\n\n(Image: Reuters)\n\nOne of the first major Bosman transfers after its introduction in 1995, McManaman had a series of contract wrangles before finally seeking pastures new.\n\nAfter almost signing for Barcelona, the flying winger signed a pre-contract agreement with their Spanish rivals Real Madrid five months before eventually departing Anfield.\n\nLiverpool couldn't compete with the financial muscle from abroad as McManaman signed up for his bumper pay-day, and was jeered by the club's fans for being 'greedy'.\n\nAdded to that was problems at Madrid which caused striker Raul to state: \"If McManaman thinks he is coming to one of the world's top clubs then he has made a big mistake.\"\n\nBut his move was vindicated, as he scored a scissor kick in the Champions League final to help Madrid win the competition in his first season, becoming the first Englishman ever to win it with a foreign club.\n\nHe added another Champions League title two years later, as well as two domestic titles, to become the most successful English football export overseas and win the hearts of Madrid fans.\n\nRobert Lewandowski - Borussia Dortmund to Bayern Munich, 2014\n\n(Image: Bongarts/Getty Images)\n\nBorussia Dortmund must be sick of Bayern Munich by now.\n\nBVB have become less rivals and more like an inadvertent feeder club in recent seasons, with Mario Gotze, Mats Hummels, and Lewandowski jumping ship.\n\nThe departure of the Polish striker is perhaps the one that's most hit home, after he had played such a bug success in the club's successive Bundesliga title wins and taken them to a Champions League final - which they lost to Bayern.\n\nLewandowski,31, has since trumped his time at Signal Iduna Park with five back-to-back championships.\n\nHe has also finished top Bundesliga goalscorer three times for Bayern, as well as player of the year once.\n\nAnd his latest season has been breaking records, after scoring eight goals in his first eight games of the campaign.\n\nProlific.\n\nHenrik Larsson - Celtic to Barcelona, 2004\n\n(Image: Reuters)\n\nGoal machine and hero at Celtic, Henrik Larsson's move to Barcelona in the summer of 2004 came a little out of the blue.\n\nMore so for Celtic fans when he scored against them not long after switching to the Nou Camp.\n\nLarsson spent just two seasons with the Spanish giants, with the first of those ravaged by injury, and it wouldn't be unfair to say his best years were behind him.\n\nYet his contribution to the club will forever be remembered for a pivotal display in the Champions League final of 2006.\n\nWith his team a goal down, Larsson came off the bench to set up two goals, making Barcelona European champions, and breaking the hearts of Arsenal - and Sol Campbell - in the process.\n\nEsteban Cambiasso - Real Madrid to Inter Milan, 2004\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nWith Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, and Luis Figo in the midfield, it's probably not unfair to say few from Real Madrid would have missed Cambiasso when he left.\n\nHe only played two seasons at the Bernabeu, but was mostly on the fringes of the first team.\n\nMadrid were happy to let him leave, and Inter quickly acquired his services on a free.\n\nThe Argentine midfielder then spent a decade at the San Siro, which included five back-to-back Serie A wins, eight domestic cups and a Champions League title.\n\nOne of each came in the historic treble-winning season under the tutelage of Jose Mourinho.\n\nAnd he then followed in the footsteps of all of the footballing greats... and joined Leicester .\n\nJames Milner - Man City to Liverpool, 2015\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nMr Versatile himself.\n\nMore than a few people scoffed when Man City drummed up \u00a326 million to prise 'Boring James Milner' from Aston Villa in 2010.\n\nAnd just five years later he was heading up the A62 to Liverpool for nothing, with the Yorkshireman not fitting in with City's blueprint for the future, despite helping them to two Premier League title wins during his stay.\n\nBut their loss was Liverpool's gain, as they snapped up an experienced England international at the age of 28.\n\nMilner has since played in almost every position, from his favoured centre-midfielder to left-back.\n\nThe Reds vice-captain topped his time at Anfield so far with a Champions League trophy in June, and has since been hailed as 'unique and exceptional' by boss Jurgen Klopp.\n\nTreat yourself to a Ribena, James.
