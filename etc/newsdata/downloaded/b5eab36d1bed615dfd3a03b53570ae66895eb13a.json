Museum.\n\nIt's the first time the species has been found in B.C., he said. It's been preserved as part of the museum's collection.\n\n\"I knew it was a new arrival and a real shock for British Columbia,\" Hanke said.\n\nThe fish was found on a beach near Jordan River, a community about 70 kilometres west of Victoria, with evidence of birds having picked over it.\n\n\"[That] kind of troubles me, considering it's a toxic animal,\" he said.\n\nGavin Hanke of the Royal B.C. Museum says this is the first time the species has been found in the province. (Liz McArthur/CBC)\n\nA sample will be sent for DNA analysis to identify which population it came from, but it might be difficult to determine exactly how it ended up on a Vancouver Island beach.\n\nHanke speculates it could be a pet trade animal, a pet on a fishing boat thrown overboard or \u2014 his strongest guess \u2014 that it swam up from California.\n\nAny time you see a strange animal or plant, it's best to contact the museum and ask someone what it is, Hanke said.\n\n\"I get phone calls every week with people dropping off a bird or a mouse or a shrew or something I've got,\" he added.\n\nThe fish is the latest anomaly found in B.C. in recent months, following a nest of invasive Asian giant hornets in Nanaimo, a piranha in Westwood Lake (also in Nanaimo) and a tropical olive ridley sea turtle found near Port Alberni.", "description": "A rare poisonous fish, usually found in tropical waters,\u00a0was found earlier this month washed up on shore near a Vancouver Island community.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5338501.1572291401!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/porcupine-fish.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
