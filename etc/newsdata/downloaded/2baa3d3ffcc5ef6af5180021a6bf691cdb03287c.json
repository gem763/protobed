A battering ram is rarely equal partner at the negotiations,\" Peter Krek\u00f3,said.\n\nPutin can also count on friendly relations with politicians within Italy's and Austrias far-right governments, as well as within Poland's political elite.", "description": "Vladimir Putin who considers the European Union as a strategic rival, seeks partners who could weaken the common policies of the EU.", "authors": ["Daniel Bellamy"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/32/16/50/1000x563_cmsv2_13623ca9-7107-5c0f-9528-61b64620485f-3321650.jpg", "published_at": "2018-09-17"}
