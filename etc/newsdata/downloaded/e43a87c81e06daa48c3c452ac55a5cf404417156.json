Schwarzman, the CEO of The Blackstone Group (BX), has known President Donald Trump for years.\n\nAns Schwarzman contends the main thing people get wrong about Trump is paying too much attention to his tweets.\n\nWhile it takes a \"long time\" to answer a question about what people get wrong about the president, the one thing is that \"all of these Tweets are not worth listening to,\" Schwarzman added. \"And for some reason, everybody is focused on them all. I never have been,\" the 72-year-old investor this week at Yahoo Finance\u2019s All Markets Summit.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s easier said than done when the president uses the platform to inveigh against the Federal Reserve, make personnel and policy announcements, and attack his opponents. Wall Street has even found a link between Trump\u2019s tweets and market volatility \u2014 such as JPMorgan Chase, who recently created a \u201cCovfefe Index\u201d for that purpose.\n\n\"Some of [Trump\u2019s tweets] are just indicative of a general area of concern and aren't meant to be taken literally. And with today's news media \u2014 it doesn't matter whether it's left or right \u2014 people just hang on every word,\u201d he said. \u201cI've always thought that would drive them nuts. And that's where they've ended up as a society.\"\n\nA local resident attends the opening of the \"Donald J.

They had listened to him during the campaign and were nervous about what he might do.\"\n\nSchwarzman, who is no stranger to engaging with political leaders, met with people both foreign and domestic to hear their concerns.\n\n\u201cA lot of people knew Donald Trump, and nobody knew what he would be like in a presidential position. And so they were basically without any knowledge and had a lot of concerns about it,\u201d Schwarzman told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\u201cAnd so I would meet with them, and see what was on their mind, and see if I could solve some of the issues,\u201d he added.\n\nWatch the full Schwarzman interview here >>\n\nJulia La Roche is a finance reporter at Yahoo Finance.
