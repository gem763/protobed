There were plenty of painful moments, including when Joe Biden started rambling on about \u201cround-the-clock sex at gay bathhouses in San Francisco.\u201d But in the midst of all that, CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper got some of the candidates to weigh in on an actual policy issue that is somehow being considered by Democrats.\n\nShould the intentional withholding of a persons HIV positive status from a prospective sexual partner be decriminalized? Shockingly, several of the candidates agreed with that idea. This, as Brad Palumbo at the Washington Examiner explains, isn\u2019t just bad policy. It\u2019s insanity.\n\nShould it be a crime to knowingly expose someone to HIV without disclosing it? Most sane people would say yes. But a widely panned Vox article published this week said that state laws making it a crime to not disclose your HIV status \u201chave only increased stigma and abuse.\u201d And apparently, many 2020 Democrats agree with this ludicrous, insane point of view. This was a common theme at Thursday night\u2019s CNN town hall focused on gay and transgender issues, sponsored by the Human Rights Campaign. Host Anderson Cooper, for example, called laws criminalizing HIV nondisclosure \u201cantiquated\u201d and based on \u201cold science.\u201d Presidential contender Pete Buttigieg agreed, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not fair and it needs to change.\u201d And both on the CNN stage and in her new LGBT issues platform, Sen. Elizabeth Warren has endorsed decriminalizing HIV transmission as well.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Buttigieg and Warren saying this. Cory Booker jumped on the bandwagon as well, saying such laws are \u201carchaic\u201d and claiming they have \u201cno scientific basis.\u201d Um, weren\u2019t the Democrats supposed to be the \u201cparty of science\u201d at one point? Clearly not medical science.\n\nThe party has already almost entirely abandoned any foothold in reality when it comes to transgender issues, each one rushing to dive headlong to the far left faster than the next. But this is an \u201cissue\u201d that shouldn\u2019t even be on the table. Thankfully some great progress has been made in recent years for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the disease isn\u2019t still a deadly threat.\n\nIf someone is unaware that they are HIV positive and they accidentally transmit it to someone else, we shouldn\u2019t be tossing them in jail. But if you test positive and don\u2019t inform a prospective partner about it you are knowingly endangering their life. Brad Palumbo calls it a form of sexual assault. I think it\u2019s closer to attempted murder, or at least manslaughter, and should be handled accordingly.\n\nSadly, the Democrats are in the midst of a rush to decriminalize nearly anything and everything. And if it\u2019s an issue that can be tied to the LGBTQ community and their powerful political lobby, you can bet that the 2020 hopefuls will be jumping through hoops to prove how woke they are on the subject. Of course, decriminalization has rapidly proven to not be such a hot idea in most cases. Remember that California decriminalized theft of goods worth less than a thousand dollars a while back. How did that work out for them? Retail theft and the practice of mass smash and grabs shot through the roof.\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting that decriminalizing intentional HIV non-disclosure is going to create a spate of people doing it. (Or good Lord, I certainly hope it wouldn\u2019t.) But it\u2019s still a very serious matter and people should know that they will be held accountable if they fail to take the proper precautions.", "description": "Why don't we just skip straight to The Purge now", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IVfluid.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
