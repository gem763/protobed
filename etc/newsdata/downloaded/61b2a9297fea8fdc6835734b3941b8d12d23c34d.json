The only issue was that the photo they posted was of a different Asian comedian, Joel Kim Booster.\n\nIn the since-deleted tweet, the magazine invited people to \u201cget to know SNL\u2019s newest cast member\u201d and tagged Yang, who is an \u201cSNL\u201d writer and the son of Chinese immigrants. But the picture beneath it showed Booster, who is a comedian starring in NBC\u2019s new show \u201cSunnyside\u201d and who was born in South Korea and raised in the U.S.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter later posted a new tweet with a correct photo of Yang. (The article, which was published June 20, included photos of both Yang and Booster from a joint interview.) The magazine then apologized, saying the previous tweet was a \u201cmistake\u201d and \u201ccontained an incorrect image due to a photo error.\u201d\n\nBut people on Twitter were quick to catch the mistake and call it out:\n\nGod DAMN IT. That\u2019s @ihatejoelkim not @bowenyang. This is worse than the Shane thing. https://t.co/NPoGxUdpRH \u2014 Ronny Chieng (@ronnychieng) September 14, 2019\n\nJesus CHRIST what the hell is going on this week??????? pic.twitter.com/5wClUSD1Ri \u2014 Megh Wright (@megh_wright) September 13, 2019\n\nIt got deleted, but screenshot.@BOWENYANG DID NOT MAKE AWARD WORTHY LIP SYNC VIDEOS FOR THIS TREATMENT.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s @ihatejoelkim, FYI.

A resurfaced video from 2018 showed Gillis, who is white, making anti-Asian jokes and using a slur.\n\nLate Thursday, Gillis issued a weak apology \u201cto anyone who\u2019s actually offended by anything I\u2019ve said.\u201d\n\n\u201cSNL,\u201d which has been around for 45 seasons and has repeatedly struggled with issues of diversity and inclusion, has yet to comment on Gillis\u2019 racist video.", "description": "The publication tweeted an article about \"Saturday Night Live's\" casting of Bowen Yang \u2015 the first Chinese-American cast member -- but with a picture of ...", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7c43243b0000039fd2c446.jpeg?cache=xwjymazuhv&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
