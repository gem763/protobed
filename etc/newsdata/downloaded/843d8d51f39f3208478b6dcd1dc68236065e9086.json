If you want a phone with a huge, near perfect screen, top-end performance, and great build quality, those were your choices. Sure, the Pixel XL line is pretty good and Huawei makes great big phones, but the former hasn\u2019t sold well and the latter isn\u2019t sold in the US.\n\nNow, OnePlus is throwing its hat into the ring with a phone that purports to be just as good and high-quality as a Galaxy S10 Plus or iPhone XS Max, but it costs hundreds less. That\u2019s the pitch for the OnePlus 7 Pro, which is launching on T-Mobile for $699 and will also be available unlocked in three different configurations ranging from $669 to $749. If you\u2019re familiar with OnePlus, you might know it as a company that portrays itself as a scrappy underdog that makes midrange phones that punch above their weight class.\n\nWith the 7 Pro, OnePlus is declaring that it\u2019s no longer just a middle-weight boxer. It wants to challenge Apple and Samsung in the heavyweight class. It has created a phone that \u2014 on paper, at least \u2014 has certainly earned a chance to take on the champions.\n\nLet\u2019s get ready to rumble.\n\nOur review of OnePlus 7 Pro Verge Score 8.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Amazing screen\n\nGreat battery life\n\nNice Android customizations Bad Stuff Camera is good, but not stellar\n\nHeavy, may be too big for some\n\nNo wireless charging or IP rating for water resistance Buy for $699.99 from T-Mobile Buy for $699.99 from OnePlus\n\nOne of the things that distinguishes the top-flight, expensive phones from regular phones is overall build quality. The phone has to feel like it deserves to cost as much as it does. The 7 Pro does, though perhaps because it borrows much of its basic design from Samsung\u2019s Galaxy phones. The glass on the front and back curves in toward a metal rail that runs all around the frame. Where OnePlus (barely) differentiates itself is the back of the phone. It has a matte finish and iridescent colors, plus a vertical array of cameras.\n\nThe screen is the star of the show\n\nThe OnePlus 7 Pro is also a large phone; it\u2019s just a little bigger and heavier than Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 9. It has a screen that\u2019s about 6.5 inches diagonally (depending on how you count the curved edges) in a fairly tall 19.5:9 aspect ratio. If you\u2019re used to big phones, none of this will put you off. If you\u2019re not used to big phones, you might be tempted to give this one a try anyway because the screen is so nice.\n\nThe thing that you\u2019ll likely show off to your friends is the motorized pop-up selfie camera. It\u2019s a neat trick and a relative rarity in the US, but the whole point of it is to allow OnePlus to stretch the display edge to edge without any notches or camera cutouts. The bezels are tiny all the way around, and on the left and right edges, the screen curves into the body just like on a Samsung Galaxy phone.\n\nI hate to use the word \u201cimmersive\u201d because it\u2019s been over-marketed into meaninglessness, but that\u2019s the word for the screen. It is so large and so expansive you hardly notice there\u2019s a phone behind it when you look at it. (Though you will feel it, as the OnePlus 7 Pro is heavy.)\n\nStill, big screens are nothing special anymore. What really matters at this tier of phones is the quality of the screen. OnePlus nailed it on several important fronts.\n\nFirst, the screen hits the basics: It\u2019s high resolution, gets really bright, and has vibrant colors. It\u2019s an OLED screen, of course, just like you should expect on a high-end phone. OnePlus offers a few different color calibration presets, or there are sliders to customize color profiles like sRGB or P3 even further. If you want a more neutral look for better color accuracy, you can do that, but I left it at the default \u201cVivid\u201d setting most of the time and was quite pleased with it.\n\nOnePlus has gone a little further than that, though, by giving this screen a higher refresh rate: 90Hz instead of 60Hz. It makes everything from scrolling to animations look much smoother. As on the iPad Pro, a faster refresh rate is the sort of thing you don\u2019t really think you\u2019ll care about until you use it and somehow everything else feels a little stuttery. It means you can read as you scroll, and touch responses feel much more in tune with your finger\u2019s placement.\n\nThe 7 Pro will dynamically change either the refresh rate or the resolution on the fly, depending on whether the app you\u2019re using might be better off with something slower or lower resolution (e.g. watching a 1080p video). It\u2019s not the first phone to offer a high refresh rate screen, but the others so far have been esoteric gaming phones with other significant compromises.\n\nThe screen has one more trick \u2014 well, technically it\u2019s what\u2019s under the screen: a fingerprint sensor. An in-screen fingerprint sensor is also nothing new anymore, even for OnePlus, but the 7 Pro has a better performing scanner than anything I\u2019ve tried, including last year\u2019s OnePlus 6T or this year\u2019s Galaxy S10 line.\n\nIt has the fastest in-screen fingerprint sensor I\u2019ve tried\n\nOnePlus went with an optical sensor as opposed to Samsung\u2019s ultrasonic one. That means that the screen has to light up a bright green circle to read your thumb and it might not work well if your fingers are wet or dirty. But those potential drawbacks are minor compared to the upsides. The 7 Pro has a larger sensor so you don\u2019t have to be especially careful about where you set your thumb. It\u2019s also super fast, nearly as fast as a more traditional fingerprint sensor on the back of other Android phones.\n\nWithin a day, I was blindly and unthinkingly slapping my thumb down on the right spot to unlock the 7 Pro. I am still working on hitting the right spot on my Galaxy S10, months after I bought it. I think the fingerprint scanner is good enough that you can just use it without trying to find another solution, but if you do really want to unlock the 7 Pro with your face, you can. The front camera will pop up and read your image in less than a second before unlocking the phone and hiding away again. But just know that like the Galaxy S10\u2019s face unlock feature, this method is far less secure and can be easily spoofed.\n\nIf there\u2019s one place where I would argue that OnePlus cut corners on the hardware, it would be water resistance. Specifically, I have no idea how water resistant it is because the company opted not to get an IP rating for it. Perhaps it\u2019s because the motorized selfie camera is a danger? OnePlus dropped the phone in a water bucket as a publicity stunt, claiming that IP ratings are a waste of money. They\u2019re not: IP ratings provide consumers useful guidance on how durable their phones are.\n\nTop-tier build quality and screen? Check and gigantic check. But potential flagship (and even midrange) phones always break up on the same shoals: camera quality. It was the main downfall of the OnePlus 6T, and despite the company\u2019s lofty claims that the 7 Pro is much better, I started with a healthy dose of skepticism.\n\nThat skepticism was multiplied when I saw that OnePlus was lading on lots of cameras here. In addition to the main sensor, there\u2019s that pop-up selfie cam, a wide-angle camera, and a 3x telephoto camera, which has slightly more reach than the 2x telephotos that are on the iPhone or Samsung devices.\n\nSurprise! I\u2019ve been mostly pleased with the shots I\u2019m getting out of the 7 Pro. The main 48-megapixel sensor outputs 12-megapixel images by default and those images are quite good \u2014 often good enough to hang with the Galaxy S10, iPhone XS, and even occasionally the Pixel 3.\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnePlus 7 Pro camera specs Main Camera Sony IMX586\n\n48 megapixels (normally outputs 12-megapixel images)\n\n1.6 \u03bcm (4 in 1) pixels, OIS, EIS, f/1.6 Telephoto 8 megapixels\n\n1.0 \u03bcm pixels, OIS, f/2.4\n\n3x optical zoom Wide Angle 16 megapixels\n\nf/2.2\n\n117-degree field of view Selfie camera Sony IMX471\n\n16 megapixels\n\n1.0 \u03bcm pixels, EIS, f/2.0\n\nVideo: 1080p at 30 fps Video capability 4K at 30 / 60 fps, 1080p at 30 / 60 fps\n\nSuper Slow Motion: 1080p at 240 fps, 720p at 480 fps\n\nTime-lapse Other features Multi Autofocus (PDAF+LAF+CAF)\n\nModes: portrait, UltraShot, night mode, pro mode, AI Scene Detection, panorama, HDR, Studio Lighting, RAW Image\n\nLike every phone manufacturer, OnePlus has to make aesthetic decisions in addition to the technical ones. The 7 Pro\u2019s images tend to be a little less contrasty and a lot warmer than what you\u2019ll get on the Pixel 3. It\u2019s closer to what the Galaxy S10 or the iPhone XS do in that regard, but I prefer the Pixel\u2019s more photographic images.\n\nThe 7 Pro does struggle a little more in tricky situations \u2014 like when your subject is heavily backlit. And when you really get in and pixel peep, you\u2019ll find something to complain about on a technical level, but that\u2019s true of any smartphone. Zoom back out and overall the 7 Pro\u2019s images all look like they could belong in the top tier of smartphone cameras.\n\nThat\u2019s the story with the main camera: it\u2019s respectable in a way previous OnePlus cameras haven\u2019t been. Unfortunately, I\u2019m less impressed with all of the other cameras. When they have plenty of light to work with, both the telephoto and wide-angle cameras produce nice images. But indoors, they tend to look washed out and foggy. I still have a blast using them, but I found myself falling back to the main sensor more often than not.\n\nAs for video, the 7 Pro certainly has all the resolution, frame rates, and slo-mo options you could want. I\u2019ve only done a little testing, but so far I\u2019d say it bests the Pixel 3 \u2014 but it\u2019s not quite as dependable as Samsung or the iPhone. It doesn\u2019t push the envelope, but I haven\u2019t seen anything significant to complain about.\n\nThat pop-up selfie camera isn\u2019t as good as on other phones at this level, but it\u2019s passable. You just have to remember to change the default away from mirrored selfies so you\u2019re not looking at your evil twin all the time.\n\nIt\u2019s also reasonable to be worried about the motor. Moving parts can break. OnePlus says it\u2019s rated for 300,000 uses, so I guess we\u2019ll see. It does auto-retract if it detects sudden movement like a drop, and a pop-up warning chastises you if you try to push it in manually. I can\u2019t promise you that it won\u2019t break, but it seems fine to me. It also extends and retracts fairly quickly, which was something I didn\u2019t expect.\n\nLastly, OnePlus offers the usual suite of camera features. There\u2019s a pro mode with lots of manual controls, a time-lapse mode, and a slow-motion video mode. The auto HDR purports to be faster than the Pixel because it takes advantage of the 48-megapixel sensor to combine images all at once (I didn\u2019t really notice a big difference in processing time). There\u2019s a \u201cNightscape\u201d mode that makes people look like wraiths, but does work well for landscapes (the name was probably a hint). But even then, it isn\u2019t nearly as impressive as what you get on a Huawei P30 Pro or a Pixel 3. OnePlus also has portrait modes for both front and back, but the cutouts are really obvious if you zoom in even a little.\n\nTo fight in the heavyweight flagship ring, OnePlus needed to step up its camera performance. It has. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s better than other top-end phones, but, to me, the bottom line is that the camera should not keep you from buying the OnePlus 7 Pro unless having the absolute best camera is at the very top of your priority list.\n\nThe OnePlus 7 Pro is very, very fast. It should be: it has top-tier specs for an Android phone. There\u2019s the requisite Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor, but it\u2019s paired with both fast RAM and capacious storage. You have a choice of 6, 8, or 12GB of RAM and either 128 or 256GB of storage, depending on your model. The RAM is LPDDR4X and the storage is UFS 3.0 \u2014 both the top of the line for what you can get in a phone at this point.\n\nOnePlus 7 Pro specs 6.67-inch screen, 6.46 usable area\n\n3120 x 1440 pixels, 516 ppi, 19.5:9 aspect ratio\n\n\u201cFluid AMOLED\u201d 90Hz refresh rate\n\nSnapdragon 855\n\n6GB, 8GB, or 12GB RAM\n\n128GB or 256GB UFS 3.0 storage\n\n4,000mAh battery\n\n\u201dWarp Charge\u201d fast charging; no wireless charging\n\nNo IP rating for water or dust resistance\n\nIn-display optical fingerprint sensor\n\n2 x 2 MIMO Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0\n\n162.6 x 75.9 x 8.8 mm\n\n206 grams\n\nAndroid 9 Pie with OxygenOS\n\nIf all those numbers are gibberish to you, don\u2019t worry about it: just know it\u2019s equal to or better than any other Android phone I\u2019ve tested for speed and responsiveness, the latter of which is likely enhanced by the 7 Pro\u2019s unique high-refresh display. I am reviewing the $749 12GB / 256GB model here and it flies. More importantly, all that RAM means that apps can stay active in memory for longer. I suspect OnePlus has optimized the software some \u2014 if only by trimming down the length of common animations.\n\nI\u2019m also really pleased with the 4,000mAh battery \u2014 or, more specifically, with the battery life I\u2019m getting on the 7 Pro. I\u2019m running beyond a full day and well into the second with moderate use and easily pulling a full day even with heavy usage. Standby time is also better than I\u2019ve grown used to on Android phones, probably because OnePlus\u2019 software is more aggressive at shutting radios and processes down when the phone sits idle.\n\nUnfortunately, OnePlus continues to insist on using its own custom charging technology over USB-C instead of going with the more standard Power Delivery system or offering wireless charging. The company isn\u2019t wrong when it says its adapter can charge up the phone super fast and keep it cool while doing so, but I\u2019d rather it just work better with all the power accessories and cables I already have. Every other phone at the premium level offers wireless charging, OnePlus really should have included it here.\n\nOn the audio side, it\u2019s mostly good news. There\u2019s no headphone jack (were you really expecting one?) and no adapter in the box, but I haven\u2019t had any problems with Bluetooth performance. The stereo speakers sound fine at normal volumes. They also get quite loud \u2014 but you\u2019ll quickly learn that turning the volume to the max is a terrible idea because the sound gets super chippy.\n\nPerformance is great, as are the OnePlus software customizations\n\nI love that OnePlus is hanging on to its signature physical ringer switch, which has three stages: ring, vibrate, and silent. You can customize all of those settings, but the defaults worked really well for me. (The switch is also really satisfying to fiddle with.)\n\nI also really like OnePlus\u2019 custom version of Android, OxygenOS. It\u2019s based on Android 9 Pie, and it\u2019s filled with nice little touches without being overbearing and gives you a ton of customization options. OnePlus also has a good history of updating its devices quickly after Google releases new Android versions, something that can\u2019t be said for many of its Android competitors.\n\nYou can set up gestures to get around (you swipe up to go home, swipe up on either side to go back). You can turn on a \u201cZen mode\u201d that locks you out of your phone for 20 minutes so you can look at a damn tree or something. There are simple theming options. There\u2019s a game mode that\u2019s less annoying than Samsung\u2019s. I also used Reading Mode more than I thought I would; it automatically turns the screen monochrome in apps that you select to mimic an e-reader. There\u2019s also a screen recorder, something that Google itself seems incapable of building directly into Android.\n\nThere\u2019s another thing I just wish everybody would do: the \u201cminus one\u201d screen to the left of the home screen lets you put Android widgets in a vertically scrolling list, just like the iPhone does with its widgets. It\u2019s so much more useful than the Google or Bixby feed of news that other Android phones foist on you.\n\nThe 7 Pro is a spec monster. And with Android phones, I usually get a little nervous when I see spec monsters. It\u2019s often a sign that the fit and finish are going to be an afterthought. But in a week or so of using the 7 Pro, I didn\u2019t feel like any corners were really cut. The screen is incredible, the cameras are respectable, and the software is clean and fast.\n\nI started this review with a heavyweight boxing metaphor because it\u2019s fun, but the reality is that every phone comes with trade-offs, even the gigantic ones. Whatever OnePlus\u2019 marketing department may tell you, there\u2019s no such thing as a no-compromise phone, even when you are spending more than a thousand dollars.\n\nOnePlus made compromises, just like everybody else, but they\u2019re the right ones\n\nOnePlus is an interesting phone maker because it makes different choices for those compromises. With the OnePlus 7 Pro, it compromised on something it hadn\u2019t before: price \u2014 $699 is more than its phones used to cost, but it means it has a more legitimate claim to compete with the likes of the Galaxy S10 Plus, Pixel 3 XL, and even the iPhone XS Max.\n\nIt might be more than previous OnePlus phones, but it\u2019s still a lot less than comparable big-screened phones: a Galaxy S10 Plus is $300 more and comes with half the storage, for example. If the OnePlus 7 Pro has a haymaker in this fight, it is the price.\n\nSome of those competitors will have must-have features for many customers \u2014 the Pixel\u2019s camera and iOS on the iPhone come to mind. But if you don\u2019t have a compelling need for a feature on one of those other big phones, I can\u2019t think of a compelling reason to not buy this one.", "description": "The OnePlus 7 Pro is a big-screened phone that purports to be just as good and high-quality as a Galaxy S10 Plus or iPhone XS Max, but it costs hundreds less.
