(\u201cPan Orient\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (POE \u2013 TSXV) is pleased to announce that the L53-DD6ST1 exploration well encountered approximately five meters of interpreted net oil pay within the CC sandstone. This interpretation is based on open hole wire line logs, oil and gas shows observed while drilling, pressure data and analog to the offsetting L53-DD oilfield wells. The CC sandstone reservoir was encountered at a true vertical depth of 1,031 meters, approximately 529 meters northwest of the earlier announced L53-DD5ST1 (\"AA South\" prospect) oil discovery and 1,035 meters due west of the L53-DD oilfield well pad. The interpreted net oil pay is within a distinctly separate structural closure relative to all wells drilled to date and is located at the extreme down dip eastern limit of the \"AA\" prospect (as defined in the Company's July 4, 2019 corporate presentation). This was the only portion of the prospect that could be confidently reached from the L53-DD oilfield surface drill pad. Further drilling at the AA prospect is anticipated as part of the mid-late 2019 Thailand multi-well exploration drilling program, at a surface location from which the structural crest of the AA prospect can be reached, in addition to another prospect (\"AA North\") located to the northwest.\n\nThe L53-DD6ST1 exploration well was preceded by the L53-DD6 exploration well which was unsuccessful, targeting various sandstones within the L53-DD6 (\"AA east\") prospect.\n\nA 90 day production test application for the CC sand has been submitted to the Government of Thailand for approval. It is anticipated that testing of both L53-DD6ST1 (\"AA\u201d prospect) and L53-DD5ST1 (\"AA South\u201d prospect) will commence shortly after the drilling rig has moved to commence drilling of the L53-B1 appraisal well.\n\nINDONESIA\n\nEast Jabung PSC (Pan Orient 49% & Non Operator)\n\nDrilling of the Anggun-1X exploration well at the East Jabung Production Sharing Contract (\u201cPSC\u201d) is anticipated to commence prior to the end of October and an announcement will be made when this takes place.\n\nPan Orient is a Calgary, Alberta based oil and gas exploration and production company with operations currently located onshore Thailand, Indonesia and in Western Canada.\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking information.
