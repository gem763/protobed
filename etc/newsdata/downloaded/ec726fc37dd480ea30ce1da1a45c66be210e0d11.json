The Rays played later against the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nA\u2019s rookie left-hander Jesus Luzardo allowed one run over the final three innings for his first save.\n\nThe Rangers dropped all three games of the series after returning to .500 on Thursday.\n\nManaea (2-0) made his third start since being activated for the first time this season on Sept. 1 following shoulder surgery last September. He has given up one run and six hits in 18 innings, striking out 21.\n\nOakland scored its first four runs in the third inning on Semien\u2019s two-run homer off Jonathan Hern\u00e1ndez (1-1) and Seth Brown\u2019s two-run double.\n\nMatt Chapman homered in the ninth to give Oakland a franchise-record 244 this season. Chapman and Matt Olson have hit 34 each. The A\u2019s have three batters with at least 30 home runs for the first time since 2001.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez made his sixth major league appearance and second start, both to open bullpen games. He pitched 2 2/3 innings, matching his career high, and allowed three runs, two hits and two walks before being followed by five relievers.\n\nBrown also doubled in the second inning. The rookie is 20 for 52 with 12 RBIs and five multihit efforts in 16 games after being recalled from Triple-A Las Vegas on Aug. 26.\n\nLuzardo allowed two hits, two walks and a wild pitch with four strikeouts in his second appearance since being called up from Las Vegas on Sept. 9. The run scored on a passed ball by Sean Murphy.\n\nShin-Soo Choo went 3 for 3 and was hit by a pitch for the 17th time this season, giving him the AL lead.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nA\u2019s RHP Mike Fiers (arm nerve irritation) will be checked by a team doctor Monday in Oakland. If all checks out, he\u2019ll throw his scheduled bullpen that day. \u2026 Rangers C Jeff Mathis (low back strain) will miss at least four or five days. \u2026 Home plate umpire Tripp Gibson was attended to briefly by Texas\u2019 training staff in the second inning after being struck on the left arm by a 96 mph pitch from Hern\u00e1ndez.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nA\u2019s RHP Tanner Roark (4-1, 3.40) will face Royals RHP Glenn Sparkman (4-11, 5.94) Monday in Oakland to open a three-game series. Acquired July 31 from Cincinnati, Roark has allowed two earned runs or fewer in five of his seven A\u2019s starts.\n\nTexas will play two at Houston beginning Tuesday with RHP Lance Lynn (14-10, 3.72) facing Astros RHP Justin Verlander (18-6, 2.58). Lynn is 0-4 in his last seven starts with a 3.76 ERA, and the Rangers are 0-7 at Minute Maid Park this season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Sean Manaea limited Texas to three singles over six scoreless innings, Marcus Semien became the third Oakland slugger with 30 homers and the Athletics beat the Rangers 6-1 Sunday for their sixth straight win.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/athletics_rangers_baseball_93694_c0-143-1788-1185_s1770x1032.jpg?6ed354fd30469467d5b1abd4d1b5a52e7ebaa487", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
