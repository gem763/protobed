The 79-year-old's fortune stems from such diverse sources as oil, railroads, telecom, real estate, and entertainment. He's the chairman of Anschutz Entertainment Group, which owns the wildly popular Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.\n\nAnschutz at a Los Angeles Galaxy's MLS match against Toronto FC at the StubHub Center on September 16, 2017 in Carson, California.

Hunt.\n\nWhile Hunt was ranked 10th on Forbes' richest Americans list in 1982, he almost could have been ranked higher.\n\nBy January 1980, Hunt and his brothers, Nelson Bunker Hunt and Lamar Hunt, controlled one-third to half of the world's silver market. Their stakes were worth about $7 billion at the time, according to The New York Times. But just two months later, the brothers lost more than $1 billion and ended up going bankrupt when the silver market collapsed.\n\nWilliam Herbert Hunt in Washington, DC in 1989. AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite\n\nHunt and his brother, Nelson, at one point owned a Greek and Roman coin collection that they reportedly sold for $20 million in 1990.\n\nToday, Hunt lives in Texas and owns Dallas-based oil and gas company Petro-Hunt, where three of his sons have leadership roles. He also owns a refinery in Louisiana, according to Forbes.\n\nThe richest American in 1982 wouldn't even make the Forbes 400 list today\n\nThe level of wealth measured on the Forbes 400 list in 1982 is nothing compared to the vast wealth seen on the list today.\n\n\"When Forbes published our first list of the 400 richest Americans back in 1982, the poorest person to make the rarefied club was worth $91 million, while the richest, Daniel Keith Ludwig, topped out at $2 billion,\" Catherine Perloff wrote for Forbes. \"That wouldn't even get Ludwig a spot at the bottom of the list today.\"\n\nIn 2019, no mere millionaires are found on the list at all. Individuals had to have a minimum net worth of $2.1 billion to make the list. The 13 people tied for last place on this year's Forbes 400 list are worth an estimated $2.1 billion each.\n\nEven considering inflation, Ludwig's 1982 net worth of $2 billion would only be worth about $3.03 billion today, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' inflation calculator.\n\nBy contrast, the richest American today, Jeff Bezos, is worth a staggering $114 billion.", "description": "Forbes confirmed to Business Insider that only two men, Philip Anschutz and William Herbert Hunt, have been on the list every year since 1982.", "authors": ["Katie Warren"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da0d01a4af90909de7c3405?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
