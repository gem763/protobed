There was a scramble to find a photographer when the couple\u2019s plans were shifted, but a photographer friend reached out to Nil Patel of Patel Creative who was able to capture the couple\u2019s special moments.\n\nDYING BOY'S CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS ALLEGEDLY VANDALIZED\n\n\u201cI dropped everything, ran upstairs, took a shower, changed and grabbed my gear,\u201d Patel wrote on Love What Matters. \u201cI bolted out the door to St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital. The ceremony was originally going to take place in the small chapel within the hospital, but unfortunately Nina was too frail to walk down the aisle. So, we had to set up the ceremony location directly in her room inside the Pediatric Intense Care Unit.\u201d\n\nPatel shared that the couple had met as young children while attending the same camp together, and that their love had grown through the years. According to their Facebook page, \u201cThe Chronic Travelers,\u201d Marino had been diagnosed with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.\n\nIn a post dedicated to his wife, Williams \u2013 who suffers from chronic heart issues \u2013 detailed the many adventures the couple had embarked on together, included multiple trips to Disney, trips to visit friends, picnics on a runway, days at the beach, and of course their wedding.\n\n\u201cAll of these memories that I will never forget and that make me so happy,\u201d he wrote on Sept. 6. \u201cBut perhaps the most amazing memory of all is when we finally got to fulfill our dream of getting married. It may not have been what we had seen in our heads when we thought about our wedding, but it was perfect. You looked so beautiful in your dress, and the way your eyes lit up when I put the ring on your finger will stay with me forever.\u201d\n\nPatel wrote that although Marino was unable to speak her vows, it took a simple look from her for Williams to understand her love.\n\n4 LITTLE GIRLS WHO BEAT CANCER REUNITE AT HOSPITAL FOR TOUCHING PHOTO\n\nPrevious posts had announced the couple\u2019s engagement on Aug. 13, followed by another in early September that told followers Marino had been admitted to the hospital again.\n\nPatel said in her post on Love What Matters that her family and friends gathered on Sept. 3 to help decorate Marino\u2019s room with photos of the couple, and to help her dress in her gown. The couple wed in the presence of their parents and Marino\u2019s care team. An update on Patel\u2019s post announced that Marino had died on Sept. 6.\n\nIn his dedication post, Williams said his wife taught him about what love means, and how to love himself.\n\n\u201cI promise that I will never forget you and I will never stop love you,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI promise that I will finish the thing you wanted to do that you didn\u2019t have the chance to do, I am going to cross every last thing off of that list that you made. I promise that I will continue what you started and advocate for chronic-complex young adults. I promise to love your family and friends because they have really shown how much they love you. I promise that one day I will have a tiny house and it will be perfect and just like we would always talk about, and even though you won\u2019t be there to help like we had planned, I\u2019ll still paint part of it teal.\u201d\n\nWilliams wrote that \u201cthe past 450 days of dating you have been some of the best days of my life, and the 2 days 15 hours and 23 minutes I had with you here as your husband were magical.\u201d", "description": "A Florida woman\u2019s wish to marry her childhood best friend came true hours before her tragic death earlier this month, and now her husband is on a mission to complete the rest of the items that she had on her bucket list.", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/09/20/694940094001_5837712559001_5837700100001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2018-09-20"}
