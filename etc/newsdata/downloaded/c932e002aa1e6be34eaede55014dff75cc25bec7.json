Our reporter Jason Rezaian was arrested and held inside Tehran\u2019s notorious Evin Prison for 544 days , even though he had committed no crime.\n\nAD\n\nFor the past seven years, Austin Tice, a freelance journalist whose work has been published in The Post, has been held captive in Syria. We will not rest until he is released and returned safely to the United States.\n\nAD\n\nOn Oct. 2, there was a memorial service in Istanbul for Jamal Khashoggi , the Post contributing columnist who was brutally murdered one year ago by an attack squad dispatched by the crown prince of Saudi Arabia.\n\nAuthoritarians in the Middle East are not the only threat to independent journalism. As we are now witnessing, technology presents another. Digital innovations have opened up incredible opportunities for journalists. But, they are also being used to undermine public trust in legitimate news by sowing confusion about what is real and what is not.\n\nAD\n\nThe speed at which information now races across the Internet enables \u201cfake news\u201d to be \u201cweaponized\u201d \u2014 strategically targeted to achieve a desired effect \u2014 be it to move financial markets, damage reputations, inflame regional tensions or influence political campaigns.\n\nAD\n\nAn MIT study found that fictitious stories spread faster and more widely on Twitter than the truth.\n\nSome have suggested that we have now moved into a world devoid of facts, or where there are \u201calternative facts.\u201d But we must be insistent: Facts matter. The truth matters.\n\nHistorically, those dedicated to factual, independent journalism \u2014 those committed to telling the truth, no matter where it leads \u2014 could count on support from the government of the United States. America has always set the standard for press freedom around the world. Sadly, that is no longer the case.\n\nAD\n\nToday we are witnessing purposeful, calculated attacks meant to discredit the very integrity of journalism. The attacks are conducted by people who would prefer to wield power free from accountability and out of the public eye.\n\nAD\n\nThreats to take away reporters\u2019 credentials, or intentionally spreading misinformation, are part of a deliberate effort to undermine an independent press and other institutions essential to our democracy.\n\nAnd fair and honest reporting by respected news organizations that contradicts a leader\u2019s narrative and pokes holes in his claims gets dismissed as \u201cfake news.\u201d The goal is to challenge the veracity of true but unfavorable reporting so that the public will ignore it and tune out.\n\nAD\n\nThat truth might not always be what a leader wants to hear. But there is an enormous difference between \u201cunfavorable news\u201d and \u201cfake news.\u201d It is wrong to conflate them. Doing so is an attack on the truth \u2014 and it is corrosive to our democracy.\n\nAs long as there have been presidents and reporters covering them, there have been institutional and, at times, personal tensions between them.\n\nAD\n\nThroughout our history, though, these tensions have been a healthy and important part of our democracy.\n\nBut today\u2019s environment is entirely different \u2014 in ways that should concern all of us, regardless of our political views. When the president of the United States publicly attacks the press as \u201cenemies of the people,\u201d it crosses a line.\n\nAD\n\nAfter all, \u201cenemy\u201d is a word to describe those we use force against. For vulnerable and misguided individuals, these are more than just words \u2014 they can be a call to violence.\n\nWhen the president uses these words, it is dangerous and reckless. He should stop labeling his fellow citizens as \u201cenemies\u201d immediately \u2014 before it leads to physical harm to innocent Americans.\n\nHe, and leaders across the globe, must understand that journalists are not \u201cenemies of the people.\u201d They are servants of the people \u2014 and of the democratic principles that empower the people.\n\nAD\n\nThese challenges, and the many others faced by journalists around the world, are daunting. The work journalists do has, perhaps, never been more difficult. But it has also never been more necessary.\n\nAD\n\nEvery day, journalists are courageously putting their lives at risk because of the conflict zones they cover, the powerful people they challenge or the wrongdoing they reveal. They are refusing to be intimidated into silence. They are still asking that next question, digging into corruption, and demanding responsibility for crimes and abuses of power.\n\nIt is our duty to stand up for these men and women. Their safety must be protected. Their questions to the powerful must be answered. They must be supported and defended as they go about the work that safeguards our freedoms.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Our duty is to stand up for these courageous men and women.", "authors": ["Fred Ryan"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/DMk31eYEsHW6t3T2CkBeoDv5mEE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/L34D7NXMJYI6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
