It is thought the decision to axe the transactions will save Barclays just \u00a37million a year\n\nIt is more than two weeks since Barclays announced a ban on customers withdrawing their savings at the Post Office.\n\nMany customers have threatened to quit the bank unless bosses reverse the decision but the bank, which claims none of its customers will be left without access to cash, has refused to change policy.\n\nYesterday it emerged that Barclays had lost 80,000 current accounts in the year to June, with only Halifax shedding more. Mr Glen, replying to a written Commons question from Lib Dem MP Jane Dodds, said: \u2018If Barclays customers value withdrawing cash over the counter using the Post Office, they may wish to consider switching to an alternative bank.\n\nHe added: \u2018Customers are more able than ever to hold their banks to account by voting with their feet, and that banks are incentivised to work hard to retain their existing customers and attract new ones.\u2019\n\nHis comments follow private interventions from the Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom and Post Office minister Kelly Tolhurst with Barclays executives.\n\nLord Duncan, a minister in the business department, said earlier this week the bank had been told in \u2018words of only one syllable\u2019 that its behaviour was unacceptable.\n\nMore than 120 MPs accused it of abandoning vulnerable customers and adding to the cash crisis.\n\nBusiness secretary Andrea Leadsom, pictured, is one of four ministers to have criticised Barclays bank after the firm announced it was no longer going to allow customers to withdraw cash from the Post Office\n\nThis newspaper has also received scores of emails and letters of protest, and close to 19,000 customers have signed an online petition demanding a Barclays U-turn.\n\nLast night more customers said they plan to desert the bank. Kathy Wilkinson, from Gloucester, said: \u2018Post offices are crucial to the social fabric of small communities and villages. I will be closing my account which I have held with Barclays for some 30 years if this goes ahead.\u2019 Tomorrow Barclays is expected to report three-month profits of \u00a317million a day. Last year the chief executive Jes Staley\u2019s \u00a33.4million pay packet was boosted by cutting costs.\n\nThe bank has closed around 490 branches over five years. More than 15million cash withdrawals were carried out by the bank\u2019s customers at post offices in 2018.\n\nBarclays will set up 300 \u2018pop-up banking pods\u2019 and cashback arrangements with 200 local businesses to curb the impact of its decision.\n\nn Have you or a relative have been affected?
