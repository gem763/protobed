(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nIn President Trump\u2019s renegade orbit, there are unspoken rules he expects his advisers to follow. He tolerates a modicum of dissent, so long as it remains private; expects advisers to fall in line and defend his decisions; and demands absolute fealty at all times.\n\nThese rules and more were broken by John Bolton, the national security adviser who left the White House suddenly Tuesday on acrimonious terms.\n\nThe rupture between Trump and Bolton, as chronicled in public and in private accounts of administration officials, is a case study of the president\u2019s sometimes Kafkaesque management style \u2014 an unusual set of demands and expectations he sets for those in his direct employ.\n\nThe episode also illustrates the varied forces that propel advisers into the president\u2019s inner circle \u2014 and often churn them out with similar velocity.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re there more as an annoyance to him because he has to fill some of these jobs, but you\u2019re not there to do anything other than be backlighting,\u201d said Anthony Scaramucci, a former White House communications director who is now critical of Trump. \u201cHe wants, like, a catatonic loyalty, and he wants you to be behind the backlights. There\u2019s one spotlight on the stage, it\u2019s shining on Trump, and you\u2019re a prop in the back with dim lights.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s desires for his advisers range from the trivial \u2014 someone who looks the part \u2014 to the traditional \u2014 someone willing to vigorously support him and defend his policies in media appearances. But these demands can be grating and at times terminal for members of his staff \u2014 especially for those who, like the national security adviser, may find themselves at odds with the president on critical issues.\n\n\u201cThere is no person that is part of the daily Trump decision-making process that can survive long term,\u201d said a former senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment. \u201cThe president doesn\u2019t like people to get good press. He doesn\u2019t like people to get bad press. Yet he expects everyone to be relevant and important and supportive at all times. Even if a person could do all those things, the president would grow tired of anyone in his immediate orbit.\u201d\n\n\n\nPresident Trump in the Oval Office on Sept. 11. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nLeon Panetta, who served as a defense secretary, CIA director and White House chief of staff in past Democratic administrations, said Trump\u2019s eclectic management style can be dangerous.\n\n\u201cThe presidency is an isolated position to begin with, and it is incredibly important to have people around you who will tell you when they think you\u2019re wrong,\u201d Panetta said. \u201cPresidents need to appreciate that information and not then take it out on that individual.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis president,\u201d Panetta added of Trump, \u201chas a real blind spot in that he does not want anybody around him who is critical.\u201d\n\n[John Bolton\u2019s turbulent tenure comes to a Trumpian end]\n\nCurrent and former White House officials stress that Trump brokers and even encourages disagreement, but only to a point and only on his terms. The president enjoys gladiator fights \u2014 pitting his aides against one another like so many ancient Romans \u2014 but only if he can play emperor, presiding over the melee and crowning the victor.\n\n\u201cHe has become more convinced than ever that he is the \u2018chosen one,\u2019 \u201d said Tony Schwartz, who co-wrote Trump\u2019s 1987 bestseller, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d but has since become critical of the president. \u201cThe blend of the megalomania and the insecurity make him ultimately dismissive of anybody\u2019s opinion that doesn\u2019t match his own.\u201d\n\nOne of Bolton\u2019s fatal sins was believing he could outmaneuver the president and promote the hawkish worldview he has advocated for decades, according to Republicans familiar with the dynamic.\n\n\u201cAnybody who thinks they\u2019re smart enough to manipulate Trump, they\u2019re very foolish, and that\u2019s what happens in this city,\u201d said Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker and Trump ally. \u201cPeople mistake a willingness to eat cheeseburgers and drink Coke with being a buffoon, and he\u2019s not a buffoon.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom left, then-national security adviser John Bolton, then-Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats, FBI Director Christopher A.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nTrump\u2019s advisers can be arranged into several categories, as one former senior White House official explained. In bucket one, this person said, are those aides whose demise \u2014 often via tweet \u2014 is all but foregone, the result of the president\u2019s coming to suspect that an adviser thinks he or she is smarter than he is or is trying to undermine him in some way. Rex Tillerson, Trump\u2019s first secretary of state, is a cautionary tale of this category.\n\nIn bucket two sits the adviser who simply doesn\u2019t gel with the president, ultimately failing to build the personal rapport necessary to survive, this person said. Trump may think this official is a good person who genuinely wants to help implement his policies \u2014 but for whatever reason, the adviser just irritates the president. H.R. McMaster, who preceded Bolton as national security adviser, is an example.\n\nThere is the politically expedient adviser, who brings Trump utility in the short term. Stephen K. Bannon, a former White House chief strategist, was useful early in the administration in helping to channel the hard-right base that lifted Trump to victory.\n\nA final category is the shiny new toy \u2014 an adviser Trump has recently hired and is excited about, whether because of a tough nickname (James \u201cMad Dog\u201d Mattis, Trump\u2019s first secretary of defense) or because he or she has vigorously defended Trump on television.\n\nBolton moved through all the buckets before being unceremoniously dismissed.\n\n\n\nWhite House aides Ivanka Trump, left, Derek Lyons, Bill Shine, Jared Kushner, right, and John F. Kelly, seated, watch President Trump and senior congressional Democrats in the Oval Office in December 2018. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nIn some ways, Trump has an ecumenical approach, viewing top advisers less as a vaunted Cabinet and more as just one of many sources from which he can seek advice and glean information. He is, for instance, nearly as likely to heed a Fox News host as to heed a senior administration official.\n\nThis attitude was prevalent during the 2016 presidential campaign, when Trump paid far closer attention to what he consumed in media reports and tips he received in phone calls from friends than from formal presentations by his official policy advisers, most of whom had virtually no face time with the candidate.\n\n\u201cHe really doesn\u2019t believe in advisers,\u201d said a Republican in close touch with Trump, speaking on the condition of anonymity to share private conversations. \u201cHe really just has people around him he asks questions of. John [Bolton] saw his role as advisory, but Trump thinks he\u2019s his own adviser, and I don\u2019t think people fully appreciate this.\u201d\n\nSome officials no longer in the administration have offered some glimpses into the challenges of trying to manage and advise Trump.\n\nTillerson, speaking to CBS News\u2019s Bob Schieffer in December, described the president as \u201cpretty undisciplined\u201d and someone who \u201cdoesn\u2019t like to read.\u201d Tillerson also described an imperious president who would sometimes suggest ideas that were illegal.\n\n\u201cSo often, the president would say, \u2018Here\u2019s what I want to do and here\u2019s how I want to do it,\u2019 and I would have to say to him, \u2018Mr. President, I understand what you want to do, but you can\u2019t do it that way. It violates the law,\u2019 \u201d Tillerson said.\n\nAfter leaving the administration, John F. Kelly said serving as Trump\u2019s second chief of staff was \u201cthe least enjoyable job I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d Asked during an appearance at Duke University what advice he had given to his successor, Mick Mulvaney, Kelly joked, \u201cRun for it.\u201d\n\nPeople who have known the president over the years stress that, for Trump, everyone is eventually expendable.\n\n\u201cWhen you use people like Kleenex, eventually the Kleenex is filled with snot, and you throw it out,\u201d said \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d co-author Schwartz. \u201cThat\u2019s the way Trump treats everyone.\u201d", "description": "The rupture with John Bolton is a case study in the president\u2019s management style and his unusual demands and expectations of those who report directly to him.", "authors": ["Ashley Parker", "White House Reporter", "Philip Rucker", "White House Bureau Chief", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/CDzkk3TLpqx6Tmrz0-tMgMKK59M=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Y7DJRKDVWEI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
