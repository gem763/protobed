But a report last year by the group ranked it among the worst.\n\nA Nando\u2019s spokesperson said: \u201cWe take animal welfare very seriously, knowing it\u2019s as important to our customers as it is to us.\n\n\u201cWe are extremely shocked by this footage and have started a full investigation with the supplier to find out what happened and to ensure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nThe Independent has also asked Nando\u2019s to comment on claims it refused to discuss the footage.\n\nA Red Tractor spokesperson said: \u201cProtecting animal health and welfare is one of our top priorities, and we take any allegations of breaches to our standards very seriously.\n\n\u201cAs soon as we were made aware of the footage, we launched an immediate investigation to identify the farms and review the behaviours seen. Corrective action will be taken where necessary.\u201d", "description": "Chickens bred for Nando\u2019s restaurants were swung by the neck and found paralysed by deformities during an undercover investigation. \u00a0 Others were filmed still apparently displaying signs of life but being dumped in a wheelbarrow alongside carcasses of dead birds.
