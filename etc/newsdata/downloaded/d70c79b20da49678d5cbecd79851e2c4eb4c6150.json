The State Department reportedly objected to the request and refused to grant the visa, which led Giuliani to seek help from the White House. It's unclear what the response was there, but Shokin never did receive a visa.

Giuliani has previously said he wanted to interview Shokin because he promised to reveal information about Democrats' actions in Ukraine.
