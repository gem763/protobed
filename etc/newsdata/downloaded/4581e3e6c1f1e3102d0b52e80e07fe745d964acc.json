And parents could finally speak with their children studying outside the valley.\n\nImran Tariq said he had not spoken to his fiancee since the day the clampdown began, which also saw the closing of schools, the detention of scores of regional politicians and the deployment of thousands of troops to guard neighbourhoods and highways.\n\nMr Tariq, a student, waited for hours in the park so that he could talk freely in this largely conservative society, where couples still avoid talking to their partners in front of family members before marriage. When the signal appeared, he quickly dialled.\n\n\u201cAre we still together?\u201d he asked his girlfriend, who lives outside the valley. \u201cI thought you might have married someone else.\u201d\n\nHis girlfriend broke down sobbing on the phone.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Sporadic protests still erupt between Kashmiris and Indian security forces.\n\nMany people making their first calls wanted to know how the world was responding to the situation in Kashmir.\n\n\u201cDoes the world know we have been dying a slow death?\u201d Firdous Ahmad, a Srinagar resident, asked a friend on the phone inside the park.\n\nHis friend told him there had been protests in New York and in London, but that in the southern Indian city of Bangalore where he lived, no one cared about what was going on in Kashmir.\n\nDoctors said the resumption of mobile phone connections would help save the lives of people in need of ambulances and other urgent medical care.\n\n\u201cPeople won\u2019t die now because they can\u2019t call an ambulance,\u201d said Irfan Hussain, a cardiologist who works at a large hospital in Kashmir. \u201cA working phone will help people living in far-flung areas.\u201d\n\nEven after Monday\u2019s partial restoration of service, many Kashmiris remain cut off, as service was restored only for those with billing plans with phone companies, not for those using prepaid phones.\n\nThe Kashmir Valley has more than 6 million mobile subscribers, out of which more than 60 per cent rely on prepaid phones, which still do not work.\n\nSo as others celebrated, Haider Nazir said he was disappointed because he uses a prepaid phone.\n\n\u201cThey are hoping we would resume our normal life, but that won\u2019t happen anytime soon,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd there was no word Monday when internet service would be restored.\n\nFarooq Khan, a government adviser, said the partial restoration of mobile service was a sign the region was \u201cslowly moving towards normalcy\u201d.\n\nBut business leaders said the economy would continue to suffer as long as the internet remained shut.\n\n\u201cBusiness is reliant on the internet for everything,\u201d said Nasir Hamid Khan, an official at the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry, a trade body, adding that the crackdown has cost businesses billions of dollars, as shopkeepers have protested by refusing to restart trade.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "When the mobile phone started to ring, after 71 days of silence, the crowd erupted into a loud cheer.
