Trump has insisted that Ukraine open a new investigation.\n\nUkrainian officials said previously that the probe was focused on the years 2010 to 2012, before the younger Biden joined the board. They also have said that there is no evidence of any wrongdoing on his part.\n\nProsecutor General Ruslan Ryaboshapka reiterated at a news conference Friday that he knows of no evidence of criminal activity by Biden.\n\nHe said that he is aware of at least 15 investigations that may have touched on Burisma, its owner Nikolai Zlochevsky, an associate named Serhiy Zerchenko, and Biden, and that all will be reviewed. He said no foreign or Ukrainian official has been in touch with him to request this audit.\n\nThe audit does not mark a reopening of the investigation, but it could buy Ukraine some time in dealing with the White House, analysts said.\n\nThe main case against Burisma was launched by Viktor Shokin, then Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor, following the overthrow of President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014. But it soon went dormant. Joe Biden and other Western officials pushed for Shokin\u2019s dismissal from the office because they argued he was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases.\n\nA former deputy to Shokin, David Sakvarelidze, told The Washington Post that the Burisma case was shut down by Shokin\u2019s successor, Yuri Lutsenko, after a deal was reached in which the company agreed to sell natural gas at a good price to companies controlled by then-President Petro Poroshenko. That version is supported by clandestine recordings made by a businessman now in exile, Oleksandr Onyshchenko.\n\nAt the news conference, Ryaboshapka was asked about correspondence that was turned over to the U.S. House of Representatives Thursday by Kurt Volker, the former special U.S. envoy for Ukraine. Text messages show that Volker was helping to arrange a meeting between Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump\u2019s attorney, and Andriy Yermak, foreign affairs adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\u201cThese questions,\u201d Ryaboshapka said, \u201cshould be addressed to the authors of this correspondence.\u201d\n\nHe said that his office \u201cis independent of the office of the president and of political influence by that office.\u201d\n\nRyaboshapka came to the prosecutor\u2019s position last month with a reputation as an honest corruption fighter.\n\nRead more:\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The prosecutor said he wants to find out why a probe of a Ukrainian gas company was shut down in 2016.", "authors": ["Will Englund", "Assignment Editor On The Washington Post'S Foreign Desk", "A Veteran Moscow Correspondent", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/flD2eHH-BxK9jpeqicB_EHZfj4M=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/52APJLXGSMI6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
