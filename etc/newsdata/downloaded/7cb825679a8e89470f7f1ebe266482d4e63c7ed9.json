It was held by Stephen Biegun, the U.S. special representative on North Korea, and the chief North Korean negotiator, Kim Myong Gil.\n\nEven before Saturday, the two sides were far apart on the pace and scope of efforts to strip North Korea of its nuclear arsenal and long-range missiles, despite two summit meetings over the past two years.\n\nOne issue that divided the two sides at the Hanoi summit concerned initial steps Pyongyang should take to constrain its nuclear program and what it should receive in return.\n\nAt the Hanoi summit, the North signaled its willingness to shut its Yongbyon nuclear complex, the centerpiece of its nuclear program since the 1960s, in return for major sanctions relief. But U.S. officials said then that initial steps by the North should also include an across-the-board freeze of other nuclear-related activities.\n\nThe U.S. also has insisted publicly that any agreement shouldn\u2019t merely freeze the North\u2019s nuclear efforts but should include a commitment by Pyongyang to eliminate its nuclear weapons and programs. Major sanctions relief shouldn\u2019t begin, the U.S. has said, until the dismantlement of those nuclear programs is under way.\n\nNo discernible progress occurred following Hanoi until Messrs. Trump and Kim met on June 30 in the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea and the two sides agreed to resume working-level talks.\n\nEven so, breaking the negotiating logjam wasn\u2019t expected to be easy. Mr. Trump raised expectations by declaring in September he was considering a new method for pursuing denuclearization. The departure of John Bolton, a noted hawk on North Korea, as Mr. Trump\u2019s national-security adviser also spurred speculation of a change in administration posture.\n\nBut Saturday\u2019s talks ended in acrimony when North Korea accused the U.S. of lacking political will to reach an agreement and said Washington was misleading the public by calling the talks productive and for suggesting the two sides could meet again this month.\n\nPyongyang reiterated a warning to Washington to adopt a new negotiating stance by year\u2019s end, state-media reported on Sunday, a demand first issued by Mr. Kim in April, or else relations between the two countries \u201cmay immediately come to an end,\u201d according to a statement attributed to an unnamed foreign-ministry spokesperson.\n\n\u201cWe have no intention to hold such sickening negotiations as what happened this time before the U.S. takes a substantial step,\u201d the spokesperson was quoted as saying.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nAfter the talks ended, the State Department said it was ready to continue working. \u201cThese are weighty issues, and they require a strong commitment by both countries,\u201d the State Department said.\n\nNorth Korea often makes exaggerated claims in state media, particularly in reaction to U.S. policies and to senior Washington officials. However, the North often reverses its positions, sometimes within days, close Pyongyang watchers say.\n\nGary Samore, a former nonproliferation official now a Brandeis University professor, said Saturday\u2019s rupture was predictable because the U.S. and North Korea are far apart on substance of a deal and because \u201cKim Jong Un prefers to deal with Trump directly.\u201d Mr. Samore added that the North Koreans \u201clike big drama of breaking off talks.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly insisted he is in no rush for a deal, that sanctions on North Korea will remain in place if there isn\u2019t one, and that the U.S. is benefiting from Pyongyang\u2019s moratorium on nuclear-weapons tests and long-range missile launches.\n\nBut some former officials said the State Department statement may be seen by North Korea as a sign that the U.S. is overzealous for a deal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s effectively signaled Washington\u2019s hand-wringing anxiety to prolong this tug of war with the North Koreans,\u201d said Soo Kim, a North Korean expert at policy think tank Rand Corp. and a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst. \u201cThere\u2019s effectively no clever or proportionate deal in the current negotiating construct.\u201d\n\nFor more than a decade, North Korea repeatedly stomped away from talks, hoping to gain tactical advantages by creating a crisis, playing hard-to-get, close Pyongyang watchers say, and aiming to extract concessions, said Lee Sung-yoon, a Korea expert at Tufts University\u2019s Fletcher School.\n\n\u201cWhile Americans are overly eager to \u2018get a deal done,\u2019 North Koreans take their time and keep raising the stakes,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cNorth Korea has the upper hand at this time.\u201d\n\nThe breakdown in Stockholm could also serve as justification for an angry Kim regime to conduct even more weapon tests, North Korean experts said. Pyongyang has conducted a dozen weapons tests this year.\n\nThe most recent launch was on Wednesday, when North Korea test-fired a sea-based ballistic missile\u2014a move that was widely seen as an attempt to build up its negotiating leverage.\n\n\u2014Eun-Young Jeong in Seoul contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Michael R.
