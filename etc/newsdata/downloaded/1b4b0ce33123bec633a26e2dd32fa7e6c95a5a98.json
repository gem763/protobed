Days before the phone call, Trump ordered a hold on the aid for Ukraine, which has been fending off Russian-backed separatists in the country\u2019s east.\n\nTrump has denied the suggestion that he linked the disbursement of U.S. military aid to Ukraine\u2019s willingness to investigate Biden\u2019s son, saying Tuesday that he withheld the aid over his concern that European countries were not contributing enough to help support Ukraine.\n\n\u201cMy complaint has always been, and I\u2019d withhold again and I\u2019ll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine because they\u2019re not doing it,\u201d Trump told reporters.\n\nZelensky is just one of a dozen leaders Trump is meeting in New York on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, but the t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate became a focal point of the global gathering after a whistleblower from the U.S. intelligence community raised allegations about Trump\u2019s behavior.\n\nThe Trump administration has blocked Congress from seeing the complaint. But Trump authorized the release of a transcript of the call, which is expected to be made public hours before his meeting with Zelensky.\n\n\u201cFor the Ukrainians, this is a nightmare,\u201d said Sam Charap, a Russia expert at the Rand Corporation. \u201cThey are in damage-control mode: trying to minimize the controversy and not openly embracing one or another U.S. partisan position. They want Trump\u2019s support in his capacity as president of the United States but do not want to be seen as partisan.\u201d\n\nJohn Herbst, a Ukraine expert at the Atlantic Council, said the two leaders have an incentive to conduct a \u201ccalm and peaceful meeting,\u201d but anything is possible.\n\n\u201cBoth sides have an interest in stressing that they have a good formal relationship: Zelensky because he needs a relationship with the United States, and President Trump because the events of the past several days have cast a cloud over him and he needs to demonstrate that he and Zelensky get along.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes President Trump is impulsive, so we can\u2019t be certain of what happens,\u201d he added.\n\nWhatever apprehensions the Ukrainians may have, they do not appear to be shared by Trump. In recent days, the president has expressed confidence to his aides that the transcript would eventually be released, and would embarrass his critics and political opponents, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nInstead, the furor intensified and now there are concerns in the administration that the transcript may be received publicly as confirmation of the darkest interpretation of what happened.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incredible miscalculation,\u201d one of the people said. While Trump did not feel a sense of urgency about releasing the transcript, some of his advisers have been pressing him harder to do so, particularly as talk of impeachment gained momentum among House Democrats.\n\nOn Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry of the president, dramatically raising the stakes and setting up a constitutional clash between Congress and the executive branch.\n\n\u201cThe actions of the Trump presidency have revealed the dishonorable fact of the president\u2019s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,\u201d Pelosi said in brief remarks.\n\nTrump has admitted that he asked Zelensky to probe Biden\u2019s son, who has connections to a business that was under investigation, but he denied exerting any pressure on him.\n\nHunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine\u2019s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment. Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.\n\nDevlin Barrett and Ashley Parker in Washington contributed to this report.", "description": "A transcript of the two leaders\u2019 call this summer could be released hours before their meeting.", "authors": ["John Hudson", "National Security Reporter Focusing On The State Department", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/gHedXUH5ZDrZ-D3N1C2MwdPelyM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WUWBTXG7AMI6TMMZ6Y4L6LBUB4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
