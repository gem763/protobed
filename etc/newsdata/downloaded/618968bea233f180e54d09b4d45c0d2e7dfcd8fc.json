The photoshoots were done in 2015.\n\nIn the video, shared on Allkpop, she said: \u2018I\u2019m a victim of a sex crime.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said she signed up for five photoshoots and claimed that the director of the photo studio told her it would just be a normal photoshoot.\n\nYang Ye Won said she was forced to pose in nude and that men touched her breasts and vagina.\n\n\u2018I thought to myself that I might be raped and dead if I don\u2019t follow along. So I just continued, trying to get out of here alive. I opened my legs wide, stuck my tongue out, held my breasts, and pulled down my underwear when they told me to,\u2019 she added.\n\nHer revelation ignited a national petition that was posted on the website of the President of South Korea. Popular singers and actresses also helped her by signing the petition.\n\nHowever, her statements are now being ridiculed after her past conversations with the person in-charge of the photo studio through the Korean instant messaging app KakaoTalk were revealed.\n\nThe chats showed that she had 13 photoshoots and not five, and that she agreed to the photoshoots and even asked for more bookings.\n\n\u2018How about Saturday night? I need to submit my classes fee by Sunday so I need to do it one more time before then. If there\u2019s a conflict in schedule, can we do it next week with me receiving the payment in advance\u2026I wanted to ask. If that doesn\u2019t work, can you schedule me in difficultly. Obviously, I can\u2019t do much otherwise,\u2019 her messages to the person read, posted on news.nate.com.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe person said: \u2018The schedules were set most of the time because she contacted me as she needed money. I gave her 100,000-150,000 KRW ($93 \u2013 $140) hourly. We filmed up to 13 times. The filming took place with her agreement and I even asked her if she could follow through with the concept ahead of time during the interview.\u2019\n\nIn response, Yang Ye Won told SBS News: \u2018Do you think I would be crazy to give them permission, to touch my body? I never told them to lay a hand on my body. I also never agreed to wear such an attire.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018At the time, it was very difficult financially. I gave up on myself because I had already been filmed/photographed shamefully. My life was ruined already, it was over, I gave up. Everything will be revealed in court.\u2019\n\nNetizens are now giving her online abuse on her YouTube channel, branding her story a scam.\n\n\u2018As a fellow woman, I supported her petition and cried with her while watching her YouTube video\u2026 so she fooled the entire country? After her nudes were released, she filmed the video acting like she was a victim and lied all along?,\u2019 one Korean commented, according to Netizen Buzz.\n\nAnother said: \u2018She\u2019s going to go down in history as the bitch who forced other actual victims of #metoo and sexual harassment to not come forward with their stories. Please throw this bitch in jail.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018She scammed the entire country,\u2019 wrote a netizen while another posted. \u2018She\u2019s a scam. Now because of her, actual victims won\u2019t be able to come forward.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, the studio accused of sexual harassment denied all the accusations, and told Yonhap News: \u2018The photo shoot took place with Ye Won\u2019s agreement. We did not force it.\n\n\u2018At the time, we obtained the signature from the photographers, promising not to leak the photos. Things are flowing in an odd direction when what we actually have to do is find the person who leaked the photos. I\u2019m also going to be suing her back for false allegations.\u2019\n\nMORE: BTS become first K-Pop band to ever reach number one on Bilboard 200\n\nMORE: BTS\u2019 V treats ARMYs to a special inside look from the Billboard Music Awards", "description": "Yang Ye Won and her boyfriend run the YouTube channel Beagle Couple, which has 228,000 subscribers to date.", "authors": ["Jonah Hicap"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/yang1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2018-05-28"}
