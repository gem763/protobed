Technical advances mean daily supplements are now available in a wide variety of forms \u2014 oral sprays, skin patches and even bath salts.\n\nJust last week, a study at Sheffield University found an oral spray of vitamin D was as effective as pills. We asked Dr Lindsy Kass, a sports scientist and senior lecturer from the University of Hertfordshire, who has conducted studies on how well we absorb nutrients through the skin, for her opinion on some of the latest products. We then rated them.\n\nTechnical advances mean daily supplements are now available in a wide variety of forms \u2014 oral sprays, skin patches and even bath salts (stock image)\n\nMultivitamin patches\n\nVie, 30 patches, \u00a316.95, amazon.co.uk\n\nContaining a blend of vitamins C, D, E, several B vitamins and resveratrol, this skin patch promises to deliver the ingredients directly into the bloodstream\n\nCLAIM: Containing a blend of vitamins C, D, E, several B vitamins and resveratrol (an antioxidant thought to fight cell damage), this skin patch promises to deliver the ingredients directly into the bloodstream. Apply one patch to clean, hairless skin such as the upper arm daily.\n\nEXPERT VERDICT: The main challenge when delivering vitamins via the skin is its low permeability; put simply, the skin doesn\u2019t allow many substances to pass through it. In order to be absorbed through the skin, a product must be fat-soluble (because it\u2019s much easier for a fatty substance to penetrate the waxy outside layer of the skin) and contain nanoparticles which are tiny enough to pass through it.\n\nWhen ingested, nutrients are broken down by the digestive system, reducing the amount absorbed by the body. By delivering them through the skin, the theory is this allows more to be absorbed. Blood levels of some vitamins have been shown to increase with a \u2018transdermal\u2019 (skin) application \u2014 but research is inconclusive. These patches contain a good range of nutrients but there is no scientific evidence to back them up. The same vitamins in tablet form would cost under \u00a35 a month so, unless you have a condition which affects absorption of food, such as coeliac disease, there is no additional benefit in using a patch.\n\n4/10\n\nMagnesium oil spray\n\nMagnesium oil spray is said to ease sore muscles and help improve sleep\n\nBetteryou, 100ml, \u00a312.20, revital.co.uk\n\nCLAIM: Sprayed directly on to skin, this is said to ease sore muscles and help improve sleep. Ten sprays deliver 200mg of magnesium, 57 per cent of the recommended daily intake.\n\nEXPERT VERDICT: Magnesium is essential for many body functions \u2014 it helps lower blood pressure, reduces muscle cramps, aids sleep quality and improves the absorption of calcium. Several studies have shown it can be absorbed via the skin including a study I led in 2017 which found applying a magnesium cream to the skin daily for two weeks improved blood levels of the mineral by more than 22 per cent \u2014more than double what you would receive from a magnesium tablet. So the claim that one squirt gives you 57 per cent of your RDA seems fair here.\n\nAlthough it is possible to increase magnesium levels by eating more green vegetables, nuts or by taking a tablet, a spray is a convenient \u2014 and perhaps more effective \u2014 way to boost your intake, and has the added benefit of moisturising skin at the same time thanks to its oil-based formula.\n\n8/10\n\nMagnesium bath flakes\n\nOSI, 1kg, \u00a39.99, planetorganic.com\n\nThese magnesium bath flakes are not as magnesium-rich as others on the market, and if you have two to three baths a week, it would cost nearly \u00a340 a month\n\nCLAIM: The maker says these \u2018highly soluble\u2019 bath salts are an effective way to increase your magnesium levels. Add 250-300g (two cups) into a warm bath and relax for 20 minutes or more. Take two to three baths per week.\n\nEXPERT VERDICT: There is some evidence that magnesium can be absorbed through the skin during a bath, but the science isn\u2019t strong. Magnesium bath flakes have been around for hundreds of years in the form of Epsom salts which contain magnesium sulphate. Many of the newer forms consist of magnesium chloride, a more highly concentrated type, meaning you should absorb more magnesium from them.\n\nThese flakes are a combination of the two, as well as containing other salts which appear to have no known benefits. For the price, they are not as magnesium-rich as others on the market, and if you have two to three baths a week, it would cost nearly \u00a340 a month!\n\n3/10\n\nOmega-3 plus patches\n\nPatchMD, 30 patches, \u00a316.95, amazon.co.uk\n\nEach omega-3 plus patch contains 1,250mg omega 3 fats \u2018to maintain normal brain function and support eye sight, joints and the immune system\u2019\n\nCLAIM: Each patch contains 1,250mg omega 3 fats \u2018to maintain normal brain function and support eye sight, joints and the immune system\u2019. Apply one patch daily and wear for 8 hours.\n\nEXPERT VERDICT: Omega 3 plays a vital role in the functioning of the nervous system and may help keep the heart healthy. Yet many don\u2019t get enough, largely because we eat too little oily fish, which is the main source of this essential fatty acid (\u2018Essential\u2019 because our body needs them but can\u2019t make them so has to consume them.)\n\nPeople often don\u2019t stick to taking omega 3 capsules because they\u2019re generally very large and tricky to swallow \u2014 and some find they leave a fishy aftertaste. There is no published research into delivering omega 3 via a skin patch; even if particles were able to cross the skin barrier, there is no evidence yet that it could be used by the body in the same way as omega 3 taken orally. But if you can\u2019t bear to eat more fish or take capsules, it could be worth giving patches a try.\n\n6/10\n\nVitamin D3 spray\n\nHolland & Barrett 50ml, \u00a39.99\n\nThis vitamin D3 spray should be sprayed once daily into the mouth\n\nCLAIM: A peppermint-flavoured spray which the maker says may be beneficial if you eat no oily fish, are largely housebound or tend to cover your skin when outdoors. Spray once daily into the mouth.\n\nEXPERT VERDICT: Vitamin D helps keep bones and teeth healthy. The body creates vitamin D from sunlight on the skin, so we tend to get enough from late March to late September. Public Health England recommends a daily supplement of 10 mcg in autumn and winter.\n\nOral sprays deliver nutrient-containing droplets which are absorbed directly into the bloodstream via the cheeks, teeth, gums and under the tongue \u2014 in theory, increasing the amount absorbed. Vitamin D tablets start at around \u00a35.50 for a three-month supply, so the price is nearly double for the same dose. But it\u2019s probably worth it, because it should be better absorbed.\n\n7/10\n\nUbiquinol oral spray\n\n13.5ml, \u00a321.00, yourhealthsolutions.co.uk\n\nUbiquinol is a form of the nutrient Coenzyme Q10\n\nCLAIM: Ubiquinol is a form of the nutrient Coenzyme Q10, which the maker says can protect cells from damage caused by \u2018free radicals\u2019, rogue molecules linked to ageing and disease. It recommends eight sprays a day to provide a 40mg dose.\n\nEXPERT VERDICT: There isn\u2019t much evidence to support supplementation of CoQ10 or ubiquinol in healthy adults. While it does have important functions in the body, creating energy and fighting cell damage, and we produce less as we age, there\u2019s little evidence that older people are actually deficient in CoQ10 or that they need more to remain healthy.\n\nIt\u2019s also found in foods such as cabbage, chicken, beef and broccoli. The absorption route for ubiquinol is not well understood, and there\u2019s no evidence that it\u2019s better absorbed from a spray. This product also only provides 40mg of ubiquinol \u2014 less than half that in most common branded tablets, but at double the price. The one group which may benefit from ubiquinol supplements in any form are those on statins to treat high cholesterol, as it is thought these drugs can also block the body\u2019s production of CoQ10.\n\n3/10\n\nB12 oral spray\n\nHealthspan, 15ml, \u00a38.95, healthspan.co.uk\n\nThis B12 oral spray is a blackcurrant-flavoured spray containing vitamin B12 \u2018to support the immune health and energy levels\u2019\n\nCLAIM: A blackcurrant-flavoured spray containing vitamin B12 \u2018to support the immune health and energy levels.\u2019 Up to four sprays daily under the tongue.\n\nEXPERT VERDICT: B12 is a water-soluble vitamin needed for healthy function of nerve cells and making red blood cells. As it\u2019s found only in meat, fish, dairy, eggs and fortified breakfast cereals, vegans are at risk of not getting enough. The recommended daily amount in the UK is 1.5 micrograms per day.\n\nThis spray gives a dose of 250mcg and suggests a maximum four doses daily. Although much higher than the daily recommended amount, there\u2019s no evidence of harmful effects from large doses. Because B12 tablets can be bulky to swallow, this spray would be easier to take. And for \u00a38.95 for roughly a month\u2019s supply, seems comparable in price to tablets.\n\n7/10", "description": "Daily supplements are now available in a variety of forms, including oral sprays, skin patches and even bath salts.
