A smile flashes across his face. Harbor licks his lips and jokes about his dream, in which his team crushes their upcoming competition. Fans cheer with excitement. He throws up the \u201clove\u201d sign, walks off stage and gets an approving pat from his coach.\n\nWhile casting the 1999 teen flick \u201cVarsity Blues,\u201d director Brian Robbins looked long and hard for an up-and-coming actor who could encompass all aspects of Harbor, a star athlete who suffers a heartbreaking injury mid-season.\n\nSoon enough, Paul Walker strolled into his audition room \u2014 and he was perfect.\n\n\u201cIt was really about finding an actor who could make that character come to life,\u201d Robbins, now the president of Nickelodeon, told HuffPost. \u201cAnd I can flat out tell you, when Paul Walker came into the casting session, the casting directors all died. He was just so handsome and charismatic that every one in the building sort of fell apart. He just embodied that character the minute he walked through the door.\u201d\n\nSeveral people who worked with Walker told HuffPost that the actor, who died at the age of 40 in a tragic 2013 car crash, was also down to earth, friendly and kind \u2015 a California boy who would rather shark dive than be at any hifalutin Los Angeles party. Fame was not something he ever chased, but his talent and good looks led him to eventually become the face of a billion-dollar film franchise.\n\nJim Smeal via Getty Images Paul Walker at the premiere of \"Pleasantville\" in Los Angeles, California, in October 1998.\n\n\u201cPaul was just so next-level hot that he was sort of intimidating in his own way,\u201d his \u201cShe\u2019s All That\u201d co-star Rachael Leigh Cook told HuffPost. That might explain why he was frequently cast as the pretty boy jock in the late 1990s. Within the span of three months, the then 25-year-old single dad (of a young daughter, Meadow) appeared in a trio of teen-focused films that put him on the map: \u201cPleasantville,\u201d \u201cVarsity Blues\u201d and \u201cShe\u2019s All That.\u201d Walker had that thing, Robbins said, and fully leaned into his laidback West Coast vibe to make his mark as one of several actors on the long list of on-screen \u201cgolden boys.\u201d\n\nIn 1999, dozens of iterations of the jock hit the big screen. There was Seann William Scott\u2019s over-sexed, foul-mouthed Steve Stifler of \u201cAmerican Pie,\u201d Andrew Keegan\u2019s vain aspiring model Joey Donner in \u201c10 Things I Hate About You\u201d and David Arquette\u2019s problematic man-child Rob Geller in \u201cNever Been Kissed.\u201d But Walker stood out in this sea of dudes, mainly because his iterations played with the audience\u2019s expectations of the stereotype. Each of his characters represented a different level of \u201cthe jock\u201d and subverted the idea of what it means to be handsome and popular in high school. He portrayed a courteous hunk, an inspired quarterback and a horny prick, using his own style to give them depth and appeal.\n\nWalker was raised by his parents, model Cheryl and sewer contractor and boxer Paul Walker III, in Sunland-Tujunga in the San Fernando Valley alongside his three younger siblings. As a cute, personable kid, he booked a few commercials and eventually went on to appear in TV shows in the \u201980s and \u201990s, including \u201cHighway To Heaven\u201d and \u201cWho\u2019s the Boss?,\u201d as well as the soap opera \u201cThe Young and the Restless.\u201d\n\nIn his early 20s, Walker started getting incessant calls from bill collectors and decided that a return to acting was a good way to earn some cash, according to the Paramount documentary \u201cI Am Paul Walker.\u201d He signed with a manager, Matt Luber, tested for a few films and almost immediately booked the role of high school basketball star Skip Martin in Gary Ross\u2019 \u201cPleasantville.\u201d It was a good get for a somewhat newbie, but casting director Debra Zane said hiring Walker was a no-brainer.\n\n\u201cHe was absolutely adorable,\u201d she told HuffPost. \u201cVery open, nothing to hide, a tremendous amount of confidence, but equal amounts kindness. He waited in the waiting room alongside Keri Russell and when Keri left, Paul told my assistant he thought Keri was beautiful and that he was in love! He was quite dreamy himself.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cdreamy\u201d look was perfect for the role in 1998\u2019s \u201cPleasantville,\u201d which follows polar opposite siblings, loner David (Tobey Maguire) and popular Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) after they get magically zapped into their \u201990s television set and placed into a black-and-white \u201950s sitcom. The inhabitants of \u201cPleasantville\u201d are peppy, simple-minded folk; one of them being perfect gentleman Skip, who eventually falls for Jennifer and her rebellious ways as the fictional town experiences a sexual and intellectual awakening.\n\nAs Skip, Walker\u2019s aura was immediately apparent. In an early scene, he\u2019s dressed in a crisp white button-down shirt and letterman sweater as he confidently struts into a diner and stares into Jennifer\u2019s eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I ever said this to you before,\u201d he tells her, \u201cbut, well, I think you\u2019re just about the keenest girl in the whole school!\u201d He then orders a cheeseburger and a cherry Coke, his smile glistening.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to play a \u201990s teen jock in a \u201990s teen movie, but tackling this role, especially as a foray into big budget Hollywood, was surely a challenge for Walker. He played a character who is a caricature \u2014 going from an unaware, sweet-natured guy to a typical sex-hungry doofus in 90 minutes. It was an opportunity for Walker to assert himself in the industry and show what he could do with a small supporting role.\n\nHis hard work paid off. Robbins took notice and cast Walker as Lance Harbor in 1999\u2019s \u201cVarsity Blues.\u201d Lance, the town\u2019s treasured quarterback, sustains a career-ending knee injury and is knocked out of the Texas high school football season ahead of championships, providing benchwarmer Jonathan Moxon (James Van Der Beek) the chance of a lifetime.\n\nRobbins needed someone with the potential to rise to the level of Van Der Beek, who was the most well-known young actor at the time due to the success of The WB\u2019s \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek.\u201d And Walker proved he could be the perfect foil to a big-name celebrity.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t about finding movie stars. It was really about finding actors who would make those characters come to life,\u201d Robbins said, mentioning cast members Scott Caan, Amy Smart and Ali Larter. \u201cWe were just trying to put together an ensemble of unknowns, and it was a big break for them.\u201d\n\nFor Walker, it was a chance to play around with the emotions of a jock driven to the ground by his cruel and relentless coach, Bud Kilmer (Jon Voight). Lance, forced to sit on the sidelines and watch someone else bask in his former glory, realizes he could protect his teammates from Kilmer\u2019s unethical practices, which include using drugs to alleviate injuries. By the end of the film, Lance is looking out for those still able to play the game versus feeling sorry for himself.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s swirled up with a lot of sex and underage drinking, Walker\u2019s performance is refreshingly nuanced as his character agonizingly takes the cards he\u2019s dealt and moves forward. Walker portrays Lance as not just a party boy who\u2019s good at football, but gives the supporting player dimension, something that\u2019s hard to come by in \u201990s teen fare.\n\nBut if Lance Harbor painted Walker as a good guy, the role of Dean Sampson in \u201cShe\u2019s All That\u201d tossed his whole schtick out the window. Sure, Walker played another high school jock \u2014 a soccer player, nonetheless \u2014 but this time he was nowhere near the hero golden boy. He had turned heel.\n\nIn the movie, which was released shortly after \u201cVarsity Blues\u201d in January 1999, Dean gives his buddy Zack (Freddie Prinze Jr.) six weeks to date the most unattractive girl at school, Laney (Rachael Leigh Cook) \u2015 who is not unattractive at all, mind you\ufeff \u2015 and make her prom queen. But once Laney undergoes a drastic makeover, Dean turns on Zack, reveals their bet and asks the former \u201csuper geek\u201d to the prom himself in hopes of sleeping with her. Basically, he\u2019s the aforementioned Stifler, Joey and Rob combined into one gross fuckboy.\n\nHalfway through the movie, we find a shirtless Dean in the locker room, teasing Zack about his non-existent sex life with Laney. His smug smile says it all. \u201cOh hey man, I\u2019m not baggin\u2019,\u201d he boasts. \u201cI mean, if you\u2019re not gonna partake, do you mind if I do? Because I\u2019m thinking she might be a great little jam.\u201d\n\nIn the menagerie of Walker\u2019s jocks, Dean Sampson is the one who would hit closest to home with viewers\u2019 real life experiences of the athletic, obnoxious, offensive jerk. Director Robert Iscove told HuffPost he cast Walker in the role because he could, once again, be a believable companion to a leading man, in this case Mr. Freddie Prinze Jr.\n\n\u201cZack and Dean were the two jocks on campus and best friends growing up,\u201d Iscove said. \u201cSo Paul being able to give Freddie a run for his money with the female fans worked in his favor.\u201d\n\nWalker\u2019s ability to stand his ground next to the likes of Van Der Beek and Prinze Jr. in successful teen movies led him to work alongside another well-known young actor: \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek\u2019s\u201d Joshua Jackson. In 2000\u2019s thriller \u201cThe Skulls,\u201d about an Ivy League secret society, Walker impressed director Rob Cohen with his ability to stand out and fully embrace the role of \u201ca scion of a wealthy east coast family,\u201d despite being as California as they come.\n\n\u201cI knew he could make a wonderful leading man and, down the road, an action hero,\u201d Cohen told HuffPost. That\u2019s why he asked Walker to headline his next movie, \u201cThe Fast and the Furious,\u201d in which he would play Brian O\u2019Conner, an undercover police officer searching the illegal street racing world for a crew of hijackers. Brian\u2019s a mashup between a jock and a cop \u2014 a handsome thrill seeker who becomes enamored with race cars while on duty.\n\nLittle did Walker know \u201cThe Fast and the Furious\u201d would make him a household name and spawn a film franchise worth $5 billion, a series that\u2019s still going strong 20 years later with the latest installment, \u201cHobbs and Shaw.\u201d With that blockbuster success, he solidified his on-screen evolution from a memorable sidekick to a bona fide headliner.\n\n\u201cWhen Paul Walker walked in the room, you thought, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s a movie star,\u2019\u201d Robbins said. \u201cPaul had it.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor The Love of 1999\u201d is a weeklong series offering some totally bangin\u2019 essays and analysis of some hot \u2014 or not \u2014 TV, music, movies and celebrities of 1999.
