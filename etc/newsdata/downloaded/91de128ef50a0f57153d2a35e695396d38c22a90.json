But their DNA was the same. Their study was published Tuesday on World Octopus Day in the Bulletin of Marine Science journal.\n\nA warty octopus\n\n\"If I had only two of these animals that looked very different, I would say, 'Well, they're different species, for sure.' But variation inside animal species can sometimes fool you,\" says Janet Voight, lead study author and associate curator of zoology at the Field Museum in Chicago. \"That's why we need to look at multiple specimens of species to see, does that first reaction based on two specimens make sense?\"\n\nWhile studying the octopuses, the scientists counted the suckers they had on each arm as well as the number of warts, if they had any. They tracked this information alongside where they found the octopuses.\n\nThe deeper in the ocean the octopuses lived, the wartier they were. The octopuses living at shallow depths had smooth skin. But that wasn't the only difference. The octopuses living on the ocean floor were also smaller and didn't have as many suckers on their arms. Scientists determined that the environment influences the appearance of the octopus.\n\nRead More", "description": "Scientists have discovered that a pink warty octopus on the ocean floor is the exact species as a smooth-skinned octopus that lived in shallower depths, proving that animals can look different and still belong to the same species.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191008113205-01-warty-ocotpuses-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
