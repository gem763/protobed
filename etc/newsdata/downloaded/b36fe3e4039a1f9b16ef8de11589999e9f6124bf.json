Bell was telling his employer he would need a few months off to row the Atlantic, as you do, when the boss said \u201cwell, we were about to offer you a promotion in Singapore\u201d.\n\nBell, who was based in Hong Kong at the time, did not think twice: \u201cI would rather look back and say I've rowed an ocean than say I've worked this job in Singapore.\n\n\u201cIn all honesty, it was instant. I said \u2018I've committed to this and this is what I want to do\u2019 on the phone call, I didn't even have to think about it,\u201d he said.\n\nHe packed his bags, and left his life in Hong Kong behind, convinced it would be easier to organise the adventure from the UK. Fortunately, his employer, advertising agency dentsu X, understood. They move him internally back home and even sponsored the adventure.\n\nBell is part of a four-man team set on rowing from the Canary Islands to Antigua, 4,828km, unsupported, as part of the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge in team Atlantic Ambition. They will need to row in shifts \u2013 two hours on, two hours off \u2013 all day and night for more than a month. They will make their own water with a desalination machine and prepare dried food packs. In his team of schoolmates \u2013 Ed Wilson, James Protherough and Jon Merotra \u2013 Wilson is the only one who had rowed before.\n\nBut when Bell was on a junk, several rums deep, talking to a friend who was planning on rowing the Atlantic himself, the idea took hold and there was no turning back.\n\n\u201cI just thought it was a really inspiring challenge,\u201d Bell said. \u201cIt will probably be my life-defining thing. Ewan, \u2018the guy who rowed the Atlantic\u2019, rather than Ewan \u2018the bald guy\u2019.\u201d\n\nGetting into shape has not been easy. The four men are 32 and 33, and have felt their age. Bell has pulled his hamstring multiple times since he set his sights on the challenge \u2013 once on a wedding dance floor. Another team member has a rotary injury and the third had a hernia when he started.\n\nBut Bell saw his dream slipping away when his weightlifting sessions seemed to open a hernia he had operated on years ago.\n\n\u201cI was gutted,\u201d Bell said. \u201cI knew it would be an operation and at least six weeks out of training. I was waiting to see a specialist, but eventually it was a huge relief. I\u2019d just torn the mesh that had been put in to protect it.\u201d\n\nEven with the many hours training, weightlifting and trying to gain weight to combat the drastic inevitable weight loss, nothing has compared to the \u201ctruly astonishing amount of admin\u201d.\n\n\u201cEveryone always tells you the hardest part is getting to the start line,\u201d Bell said. \u201cBut we thought, yeah, but we're really well prepared, we'll find the money. But the fundraising takes time.\u201d\n\nNot only were they hunting for sponsors to finance the trip, but they also hope to raise \u00a3200,000 (US$246,000) for two charities \u2013 Surfrider Foundation and the Marine Conservation Society. Both fit well with their mission, given they are heading to sea, and are worthy causes as plastic continues to ravage marine environments.\n\nBell is optimistic about the trip. He thinks it will be fun, and that they will succeed in crossing. Though he said: \u201cAsk me again when it\u2019s raining sideways, in a storm, and I\u2019m in the cabin crying.\u201d\n\n\u201cSleep deprivation can turn you into a bit of a monster,\u201d he added, so they are going to visit a sports physiologist to pre-empt the lows. But either way, just getting to the start has been a journey.\n\n\u201cIt's been a pretty big step out of our comfort zone,\u201d Bell said.\n\nYou can donate to one of Atlantic Ambition\u2019s two charities here.", "description": "Based in Hong Kong with his career extending before him, Ewan Bell does not have to think too long when choosing between adventure and security", "authors": ["Mark Agnew"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/09/780b06f0-e9ab-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4_image_hires_104907.jpeg?itok=JU74hCuA&v=1570589355", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
