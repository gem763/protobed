But we reckon that's about to change.\n\nFor a limited time, it's offering 20GB of data - plus three bonus gigabytes if you go over - for just $18 per month. Crucially, the plan is contract-free so you can cancel at any time. Here are the details!\n\nCircles.Life has thrown down the gauntlet on competitive phone pricing, offering 20GB of data on a SIM-only plan for $18 a month. That's a pretty great deal in its own right, but the absence of a lock-in contract ramps up the value considerably.\n\nAs mentioned above, the plan also comes with three gigabytes of 'bill shock protection' in the event that you go over your monthly allowance.\n\nNote that to get the deal, you need to use the discount code '10FOR12' when signing up. Otherwise you'll be slugged an extra $10.\n\nHere are the inclusions.
