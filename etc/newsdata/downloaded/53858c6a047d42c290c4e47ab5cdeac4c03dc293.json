It was the position of the Chancellor, when he refused to publish his own version of such an analysis saying it was \"self-evidently\" better.\n\nBut we are now in a different situation.\n\nThe Prime Minister's deal is being put to the electorate versus a remain option or a different, far softer form of Brexit.\n\nCrucially, NIESR calculates that the Johnson renegotiation leads to a slightly worse economic outcome than Theresa May's deal which it replaces, as the Bank of England Governor hinted to me earlier this month.\n\nWhat is driving these results? The new deal creates more distance from the European Union economy, with more regulatory barriers to trade. Unlike May's deal, there could be checks on the origin of parts in the car industry, for example.\n\nThe overall impact of these extra barriers outweighs the benefit from extra certainty of \"getting Brexit done\". Individual businesses may well disagree. But the Treasury itself has chosen not to issue its own version of analysis such as this, even though it has the capacity to do so.\n\nIf the terms of trade with the EU remained unchanged, but \"chronic uncertainty\" persisted, GDP would be 2% lower.\n\n\"The economic outlook is clouded by significant economic and political uncertainty and depends critically on the United Kingdom's trading relationships after Brexit,\" NIESR said.\n\n\"Domestic economic weakness is further amplified by slowing global demand.\"\n\nAccording to NIESR, the effects of Brexit on the UK economy are already being felt.\n\n\"The economy is estimated to be 2.5% smaller now than it would otherwise have been as a result of the 2016 Brexit vote,\" it said.", "description": "The UK economy will be 3.5% smaller than if it had stayed in the EU, claims a new study.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/15A95/production/_109452788_brexitflags2_afp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
