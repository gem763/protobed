Organizers eventually asked the protesters to let Mr. McAleenan speak, but chants erupted again and Mr. McAleenan thanked the crowd and left.\n\n\u201cI gave them eight minutes and when it was clear the Georgetown Law Center was not going to change the direction of that dialogue, then it was time to go,\u201d he told Fox.\n\n\u201cI was going to challenge them on how we could talk and start a dialogue about how to fix it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut apparently I didn\u2019t get that opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe Law Center has since responded to the incident with a statement, saying, \u201cGeorgetown is deeply committed to freedom of speech and expression,\u201d Fox News reported.\n\nThe DHS released also a statement saying the activists \u201crobbed\u201d others of the opportunity to \u201cengage in a robust dialogue\u201d about immigration.\n\nAndrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, said he was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d that Mr. McAleenan didn\u2019t get to deliver his remarks.\n\n\u201cWe need to hear from diverse perspectives in a democratic society, and the audience lost the chance to engage w/him on policy,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
