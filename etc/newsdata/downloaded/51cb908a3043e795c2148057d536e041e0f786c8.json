Trump Tunnel", "language": "en", "text": "Last year when President Trump visited Mount Vernon, the plantation home of the country\u2019s first president, he remarked that the founding father had missed a golden opportunity.\n\n\u201cIf he was smart, he would\u2019ve put his name on it,\u201d Mr. Trump said, according to news reports. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to put your name on stuff or no one remembers you.\u201d\n\nIf the president wants to be remembered for something that would help make the country great again, how about the proposed rail tunnel under the Hudson River, one of the most important and urgently needed transportation infrastructure projects in the country?\n\nThe project includes numerous regional rail upgrades, including the construction of a new tunnel and the refurbishment of the existing tunnel. That tunnel, opened in 1910, carries more than 800,000 passenger trips per day between New Jersey and New York.", "description": "A silly fight over vital infrastructure has gone off the rails.
