(What else you got???) The two-part episode ends on a lovely note with the Dunder Mifflin crew performing a joyous, coordinated dance down the aisle, but according to Entertainment Weekly\u2019s new oral history of the wedding, the original conclusion was much darker in execution: It would\u2019ve involved Dwight (Rainn Wilson) attempting to ride a horse into Niagara Falls, convinced he would survive such a stunt.\n\n\u201cI was really committed to the horse for the longest time,\u201d showrunner Greg Daniels explained. \u201cIt was like Dwight got fascinated with this historical display at the hotel that talked about various animals. It started with a cow had been swept over the falls and survived, and then a couple of people tried to go over the falls in a barrel and were killed, and then some sheep went over the falls and survived. And he came up with this theory that you could survive going over the falls if you were riding a horse, because a horse would have the instinct of how to swim properly.\u201d Dwight keeps elaborating on this theory to deaf ears, and seemingly resigns in wanting to try it out himself, until a familiar face with an equestrian pal attempts to win Pam back:\n\nRoy (Dan Denman) interrupts the wedding trying to do a big, grand romantic gesture that nobody wants and just abandons the horse and drives home. So Dwight gets on and goes into the river above the falls, but panics and jumps off the horse at the last second, while the horse goes over in the background of the wedding. I remember scouting this tank on the Universal lot and talking about how we\u2019re going to shoot this horse being swept over the waterfall. Then we got to the table read and I was the last defender of the horse. The entire staff and actors were yelling at me: \u201cDon\u2019t ruin Jim and Pam\u2019s wedding with a horse!\u201d\n\nPaul Feig, who directed the episode, added that the idea was collectively panned by the other writers and actors, which caused Daniels to craft the dance scene instead. \u201cWe were all like, \u2018This is insane. You can\u2019t send a horse over the falls.\u2019 And Greg was like, \u2018No, it would be really funny,\u2019\u201d Feig added. \u201cAnd there was this whole debate that went on in the writers\u2019 room, people are like, \u2018I don\u2019t know, I think this is kind of dark and weird.\u2019\u201d Not as dark and weird as Kevin\u2019s shoes being burned for their toxicity, but we digress.", "description": "Pam and Jim\u2019s wedding from \u201cThe Office\u201d almost ended with Roy interrupting the ceremony and Dwight flying into Niagara Falls on a horse.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/08/08-dwight-the-office.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
