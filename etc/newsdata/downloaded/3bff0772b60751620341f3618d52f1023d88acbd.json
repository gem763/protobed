Two other casualties have been reported as a result of the blaze.\n\nPacific Gas & Electric Co. restored power in Northern California after workers inspected power lines to make sure it was safe.

They did so as the Saddleridge Fire continued making its way south. Porter Ranch, California, pictured\n\nThe Saddleridge Fire broke out after 9pm on Thursday in Sylmar, California along the 210 Freeway. It is believed to have started at the base of Southern California Edison transmission tower that is located behind a home in Sylmar\n\nThe utility said it found 30 instances of weather-related damage to its equipment during the shutdown.\n\nBy Friday evening, PG&E said it had restored power to 97% of the 738,000 homes and businesses affected by the deliberate blackout that began Wednesday. About 21,000 customers remained without power.\n\nExperts have said there are between two and three people for every electrical customer.\n\nMore than 6,000 ground workers and 44 helicopters were making safety inspections, which could only take place in daylight and were expected to resume at daybreak Saturday, PG&E said.\n\nThe Saddleridge Fire has burned over 7,500 acres and destroyed 31 structures. As of Saturday morning, the blaze has been 13 per cent contained, ABC 7 reports.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, the blaze has been 13 per cent contained. The Friday blaze in Sylmar\n\nSanta Ana winds carrying the fire prompted officials to order the evacuation of 100,000 people from their homes in the foothills of the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles County.\n\nThe fire is now believed to have started from a Southern California Edison transmission tower that is located behind a home in Sylmar, California.\n\nAccording to Robert Delgado, he and his wife first noticed the fire starting around 9.30pm on Thursday night at the base of an electrical transmission-line tower from behind his home.\n\nThe fire quickly grew and forced the family to retreat from their home.\n\n'We immediately ran downstairs, went to the backyard, pulled out the hoses,' Delgado said. 'I was dialing 911. The fire just came down so quickly.'\n\nFiremen came to fight the blaze but were forced to retreat after it continued growing too powerful.\n\nThe Saddleridge Fire has burned over 7,500 acres and destroyed 31 structures\n\nA private collection of 30 classic cars burned in Granada Hills, San Fernando Valley\n\nA police chief and Granada Hills resident wait for firefighters to come fight the blaze at the man's home\n\nHe added: 'While I was hosing everything down there were flames and embers flying over those bushes at the back of our house and over our house. I was overwhelmed at the sight. Just seeing flames and embers flying over our house.'\n\nDelgado said it was a 'miracle' that his home did not burn down.\n\n'We left in tears thinking our house was going to burn down,' he stated. 'By a miracle the house is still here. Somehow those flames didn't touch our house.'\n\nThe El Dorado County Sheriff's office said Friday that an autopsy determined that the death of 67-year-old Robert Mardis minutes after the blackout was due to severe coronary disease, not the loss of electricity. The office said the investigation has closed.\n\nMarie Aldea of Pollock Pines had previously said Mardis, her 67-year-old father, was asleep when the electricity went out around 3:30 a.m. Wednesday and likely couldn't wake up in time to get his back up machine, which ran on battery.\n\nA tanker drops retardant on the Saddleridge Fire burning in Newhall, California, on Friday\n\nWhile most of this home in Porter Ranch was destroyed in the fire, this family was able to salvage a grandfather clock\n\n'We were all asleep, we heard my mom scream. She was crying,' she told KTXL-TV in Sacramento . 'My dad went down in her arms, he was going for this oxygen machine.'\n\nAldea said her father's health was poor, but she doesn't understand why the utility turned off the power.\n\n'No winds at all. And because of that, my father is gone,' she said.\n\nSome people in the largely rural Butte, Plumas and Yuba counties and in Northern California's wine country counties were in their third day without electricity.\n\nButte County is where a fire started by PG&E equipment last year decimated the town of Paradise and killed 85 people. In Napa and Sonoma counties north of San Francisco, the outages began on the two-year anniversary of deadly wildfires that killed 44 and destroyed thousands of homes.\n\nA firefighter rests as crews continue to battle the Saddleridge Fire in Porter Ranch\n\nA man comforts his neighbor after the Granda Hills resident's home burned to the ground as a result of the fire\n\nPG&E faced hostility and second-guessing over the shut-offs, which prompted runs on supplies like coolers and generators and forced institutions to shut down.\n\nRyan Fisher, a partner in consumer goods and retail practice at global consultancy A.T. Kearney estimated $100 million in $200 million in fresh food was likely lost because of the outages along with $30 million a day in consumer spending.\n\nPG&E cast the blackouts as a matter of public safety to prevent the kind of blazes that have killed scores of people over the past couple of years, destroyed thousands of homes, and ran up tens of billions of dollars in claims that drove the company into bankruptcy.\n\nThe utility suggested it was already seeing the wisdom of its decision borne out as gusts topping 77 mph (122 kph) raked some hilltops where wildfire risk was extremely high.\n\nOrange County firefighters work knock down a house fire on Singing Hills Drive as the Saddleridge Fire burns in Porter Ranch\n\nTerrifying footage shows crews battling a California wildfire fueled by winds as homes burned and thousands of people were forced to evacuate.

It's unacceptable that its website crashed, maps were inconsistent and call centers were overloaded, Johnson said.\n\n'We were not adequately prepared,' he said.\n\nOfficials say the Saddleridge Fire fire has quickly grown, scorching more than 7,542 acres by 1pm on Friday with 13 percent containment.\n\nAccording to Los Angeles officials, the fire was spreading an acre every two and a half seconds at during its peak.\n\nSaddleridge Fire Smoke Advisory The Los Angeles Department of Public Health has declared unhealthy air quality in the following places: Northwest Los Angeles County\n\nWest San Fernando Valley\n\nEast San Fernando Valley\n\nSanta Clarita Valley\n\nSan Gabriel Mountains\n\nWest San Gabriel Valley\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, the City of Santa Clarita reported the fire has grown to 7,542 acres and is only 13 percent contained.\n\nThe cause of the fire is still unknown.\n\nHelicopters made repeated water drops as 1,000 firefighters on the ground attacked flames in and around homes, 31 of which have been damaged so far.\n\n13 of those structures have a 100 percent total loss, three have a 50 percent loss, four have a 25 percent loss and eleven have a 10 percent loss.\n\n40 schools were closed because of poor air quality in the area, according to CNN.\n\nIn a news release from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, the declared portions of six California areas have poor air quality.\n\nThe news release said: 'It is difficult to tell where smoke, ash or soot from a fire will go, or how winds will affect the level of these particles in the air, so we ask everyone to remember that smoke and ash can be harmful to health, even for people who are healthy.'\n\nThey warn residents to pay attention to their immediate environment if they see smoke, soot or ash.\n\nAuthorities have ordered mandatory evacuations in the Granada Hills, Porter Ranch and Oakridge Estates neighborhoods affecting about 100,000 people on the northern edge of the city in the San Fernando Valley area.\n\nOn Friday evening, Governor Gavin Newsom announced that California had secured a Fire Management Assistance grant from FEMA to help guarantee available resources to fight the Saddleridge fire burning Los Angeles and Ventura counties.\n\nThe fire, known as the Saddleridge Fire, broke out after 9pm on Thursday in Sylmar, north of Los Angeles.

'If you stay in [mandatory evacuation] areas we cannot guarantee that we will save you.'\n\nPORTER RANCH GAS LEAK The fires blanketing the area come just four years after many in the same community were displaced and sickened by a leak at the Aliso Canyon natural gas facility. The leak was discovered in October of 2015 and officials were not able to plug it up until February 2016. At first, residents were not even informed of the leak, and had to wait days before they were alerted to the potentially fatal situation by Southern California Gas Co, the operator of the 115 wells in the area. A single well, which was 1,850 feet deep, started to leak gas, which blanketed the area with a rotten egg odor from the mercaptan - which acted as a safety measure because of its strong smell, which would alert people to a leak. Crews then got to work trying to seal a 2-7/8 pipe enclosed in a seven-inch well casing that was 500-feet below the surface. Flight paths were revised so that aircraft did not fly directly over the area, two schools were eventually shut down. Greg Hisel, assistant fire captain with the Los Angeles County Fire Department, said at the time there was no real risk of an explosion - but there were concerns that the leak could cause a fire. He said welding equipment, radios and even a cell phone could cause a fire. The leak increased California's methane-gas emissions by an estimated 25 percent in that time as 110,000 pounds of methane were released into the atmosphere hour. It is still unclear what the long-term health problems this might cause for residents, who at the time experienced nose bleeds and headaches.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the latest weather concern for Saturday will be the 'continued fire weather danger' in southern California and have issued 'critical fire weather threats'\n\nOnly 10 percent of 800 acres of the Sandalwood Fire contained as of Friday morning, the Riverside County Fire Department said.\n\nHot, dry winds sweeping into Southern California raised concerns that the region's largest utility could widen power shutoffs on Friday to prevent its equipment from sparking wildfires.\n\nSouthern California Edison turned off electricity to about 20,000 people in Los Angeles, Ventura, San Bernardino and Kern counties, but warned that thousands more could lose service as Santa Ana winds gained strength.\n\nWinds gusted dangerously as forecast before calming in Northern California, where Pacific Gas & Electric faced hostility and second-guessing over its widespread shutoffs.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom criticized PG&E and ordinary customers complained about the inconveniences caused by the unprecedented blackouts that began midweek.\n\nTerrifying aerial footage showed crews battling a California wildfire fueled by winds as home burned and 100,000 people were forced to evacuate in Sylmar on Thursday night and Friday morning\n\nMultiple freeways, including Interstate 5, Interstate 210, and Interstate 405 northbound were shut down, according to the California Highway Patrol.

'If they were energized, they could've ignited.'\n\nBecause of the dangerous weather in the forecast, PG&E cut power Wednesday to an estimated two million people in an area.\n\nAmid the chaos, a man says his 89-year-old mother has been missing since Thursday night after the wind-driven wildfire swept through a Southern California mobile home park, destroying dozens of residences.\n\nLois Arvickson called her son, Don Turner, from her cellphone to say she was evacuating shortly after the blaze was reported in the Calimesa area.\n\n'She said she's getting her purse and she's getting out, and the line went dead,' he said.\n\nArvickson's neighbors saw in her garage as flames approached, according to Turner. A short time later the neighbors saw the garage on fire, but they don't know if she'd managed to escape, he said.\n\nTurner said he's been checking hospitals.\n\nRiverside County fire officials said they're still trying to determine if anybody is unaccounted for after 74 structures were decimated.\n\nPreviously authorities said they responded to 'numerous' medical emergencies at the park. Several residents were transported to hospitals but there were no details on their conditions, county fire Capt Fernando Herrera said.\n\nThe fire broke out along the 210 Freeway near Yarnell Street and jumped the highway.
