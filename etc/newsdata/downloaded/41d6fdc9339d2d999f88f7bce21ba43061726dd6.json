It's always felt like he's the one who they've supported, not me,' she said.\n\nThe mother said that while her attacker had been locked up for the last 15 years he had been educated.\n\nMs McLean also said that she was ignored by the authorities when asking about the security of Al Baiiaty's deportation, and possibility of him returning to Australia to visit his brother.\n\nMs Henderson said she the New Zealand's Accident Compensation Corporation needed to bring 'justice' to Ms McLean.\n\n'I first raised her case in the parliament more than three years ago. I am shocked that New Zealand's Accident Compensation Corporation has still not determined her case. The endless delays and stonewalling are completely unacceptable,' she said.", "description": "Akeel Hassan Abbas Al Baiiaty raped 20-year-old Megs McLean in a hostel in Wellington, New Zealand in 2004.", "authors": ["Eliza Mcphee For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/23/20352236-0-image-a-4_1572391782645.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
