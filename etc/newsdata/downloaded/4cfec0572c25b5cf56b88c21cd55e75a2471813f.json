It wasn't easy but I had no choice.\n\n'My game is totally different now from what I was doing five years ago at City. A total transformation. At that meal, we talked about loads of things.\n\n'We kept postponing it and then when we finally met up, we talked about work for 20 minutes or so. The rest of the meal we spent chatting about other stuff, family, life in general.'", "description": "Argentina manager Lionel Scaloni has revealed Sergio Aguero has not been 100 per cent fit this season.\u00a0 Despite this, the Manchester City striker is joint top scorer in the Premier League.", "authors": ["Jack Kinnersley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/17/19660852-0-image-a-6_1570985442152.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
