It said it would review 1.5 million metric tons of smelting capacity and 4 million metric tons of alumina-refining capacity.\n\nThe company has been hurt by fears that a weaker global economy will cut into demand for its products and crimp prices for metals. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund said it expects growth of 3% this year, lower than its forecast from July and off close to 1 percentage point compared with 2017.\n\nGlobal demand for aluminum in 2019 will be weaker than Alcoa previously expected, the company also said Wednesday. The aluminum manufacturer now believes global aluminum demand will rise no more than 0.4% this year but may fall as much as 0.6%. Earlier, it said it believed demand for the metal would rise between 1.3% and 2.3% this year.\n\n\"The change is driven by weakening macroeconomic conditions, trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and contracting manufacturing activity, especially in the global automotive sector,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nQuarterly revenue at Alcoa declined 24% from a year earlier to $2.57 billion as aluminum prices declined. Its average selling price of $2,138 a metric ton for aluminum in the latest quarter was down 13% compared with the year-ago period.\n\nAlcoa reported a quarterly loss of $221 million, or $1.19 a share, wider than the loss of $6 million, or 3 cents a share, the company recorded in the year-ago period. After adjustments, the company reported a loss of 44 cents a share, worse than what analysts polled by FactSet expected.\n\nWrite to Micah Maidenberg at micah.maidenberg@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 16, 2019 18:01 ET (22:01 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
