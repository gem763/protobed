I have never thought of making money,\" Kagoike said.\n\nThe defendants denied most of the allegations at their hearing in March.\n\nThey were also indicted for unlawfully receiving around 120 million yen in subsidies from the prefecture and the city of Osaka between fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2016 by inflating the number of teachers at their preschool.\n\nThe couple were arrested in July 2017 after it was revealed that Moritomo Gakuen had purchased the land in Toyonaka the previous year for 134 million yen, despite it being valued at 956 million yen.\n\nThe heavily discounted sale sparked cronyism allegations against Abe as his wife Akie, who had been named honorary principal of the elementary school. She stepped down from the post in the wake of the scandal.\n\nAbe has repeatedly told the Diet that neither he nor his wife was involved in the land sale and that he would resign if evidence to the contrary is found.\n\nThe Finance Ministry has punished 20 officials, including Nobuhisa Sagawa who led the ministry's bureau in charge of the land sale, over the falsification and destruction of documents related to the land deal. Prosecutors have not indicted any officials over the incidents.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "Prosecutors on Wednesday sought seven-year prison terms for the former head of a school operator and his wife at the center of a scandal linked to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe over a 170 million yen ($1.6 million) fraud involving public subsidies for their schools.
