Here are five times a refinance can be a terrible idea.\n\n1. You're too focused on the immediate savings\n\nAntonio Guillem / Shutterstock More\n\nRefinancing to score a lower interest rate and lower monthly mortgage payment can be smart, but not if the new home loan won't really save you money.\n\nA refi doesn't make financial sense if you may be moving soon. If you're going to save $100 a month but will have to pay closing costs of $3,000, you'll need to stay in the home for more than 30 months to come out ahead.\n\nA refinance also can be a money loser when it causes you to stretch out your loan term. If you've been paying on your 30-year mortgage loan for 10 years and refi into a new 30-year loan, refinancing will saddle you with 10 extra years of interest charges.\n\n2. You want freedom from credit card debt\n\nMarcos Mesa Sam Wordley / Shutterstock More\n\nPaying off high-interest credit card debt with low-interest mortgage debt isn't the worst idea, but you'd better be absolutely certain you've learned your lesson about using plastic.\n\nTo wipe out your credit card balances, you'll need to do what's called a cash-out refinance: You borrow more than you owe on your home and take out the extra in cash. That money goes to your card issuer.\n\nYou'll be left with a larger mortgage and larger monthly payment. If you wind up in over your head with your credit cards all over again, you could put your house at risk.\n\n3. You're eager to renovate\n\nRomaset / Shutterstock More\n\nStory continues", "description": "A refi isn't always the wisest move.", "authors": ["Doug Whiteman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7T66g_dqXj5pFmwXxk_7wg--~B/aD00MDA7dz03Mjg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/moneywise_327/3c57797552505f45e655d6a7d51f0100", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
