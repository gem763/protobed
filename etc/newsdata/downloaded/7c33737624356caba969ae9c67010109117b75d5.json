(Photo: Amazon) More\n\nTVs are great \u2014 but only when they\u2019re on. Switched off, they\u2019re just big black boxes taking up precious space in the living room. Not anymore. Samsung\u2019s Frame TV doubles as a gorgeous piece of art. Imagine it over a fireplace! Walmart has the TV in a range of sizes on sale for up to $1,202 off, starting with the Samsung 43\" Class 4K UHD (2160P) The Frame QLED Smart TV QN43LS03R for just $798 (originally $1,299).\n\nThe devices work with Alexa and feature \u201cno gap wall mount\u201d for hanging flush to the wall.\n\nThe 4K TV (four times the resolution of full HD) is crisp and bright, thanks to Quantum Dot technology which offers a billion shades of color. One slim cable connects all your tech gear, so no more unsightly wires dangling off your TV.\n\nYou can buy individual pieces of art to display or subscribe to a library of rotating pieces. If you choose motion sensor mode, the TV will detect when you\u2019re in the room and automatically showcase your favorite work. What a way to impress guests!\n\nBoth TVs have free two-day shipping via Walmart. Want to pick it up yourself? Select the \u201cfree pickup\u201d option, and drive over to your nearest Walmart to get your hands on the stunning device.\n\nThis TV can blend in with any decor. (Photo: Walmart) More\n\n\u201cThe quality and value of the frame TV is worth every penny!\u201d a happy reviewer noted. \u201cI'm beyond satisfied with my purchase and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a new tv option for their home. The art feature is one of my favorite especially when I would rather have my wall not look like there is a tv there. This is the best of both worlds \u2014 art and entertainment! Let alone the mount and one connected source all is included with the TV. Get your frame TV today you won't regret it!\u201d\n\n\u201cBought the Samsung 50 inch TV and could not believe the picture quality,\u201d one thrilled reviewer shared. \u201cCould not believe the difference from previous different brand TV. After two weeks of use was so impressed I went out and bought two more 40 inch Samsung TV's one for the bedroom and one for our cabin. I am hooked on Samsung.\u201d\n\nShop it: Samsung 43-inch Class 4K UHD (2160P) The Frame QLED Smart TV QN43LS03R, starting at $798 (originally $1,299).
