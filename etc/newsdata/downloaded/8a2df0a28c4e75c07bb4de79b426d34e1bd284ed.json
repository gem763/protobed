Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\nWhistleblower complaint rattles intelligence community\n\nA whistleblower report filed with the inspector general for the intelligence community has jolted Congress. It concerns a \u201cpromise\u201d made by President Trump to a foreign leader, according to two former U.S. officials familiar with the matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe first found out about the complaint late last Friday evening, when Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, put out a letter that he had written to the director of national intelligence,\u201d says intelligence reporter Shane Harris\n\n\n\n\n\nPost reporters on Thursday broke news of the content of the report, which raises new concerns about the president\u2019s handling of sensitive information and could further strain his relationship with U.S. spy agencies.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia\u2019s fight with Trump over tailpipe emissions\n\nThe Trump administration is revoking California\u2019s power to limit carbon pollution from cars and light trucks. The move is expected to spark a legal battle with the nation\u2019s most populous state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re really doing is upending a system in which California for decades has driven environmental advancements in this area, essentially,\u201d says senior national correspondent Juliet Eilperin\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state has had a special waiver allowing it to set regulations separate from federal standards since the Clean Air Act of 1970. The administration\u2019s latest move to scratch this waiver could have a national impact, as 13 other states and the District of Columbia follow California\u2019s standards for tailpipe emissions.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018It\u2019s going to look like a neighborhood place \u2014 but with weed\u2019\n\nThe country\u2019s first \u201ccannabis cafe\u201d is set to open next week in Los Angeles, with farm-to-table dining and smoking options enabled by a complicated patchwork of regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest obstacles here is that West Hollywood passed an ordinance that would allow these cannabis cafes and lounges to operate,\u201d says food reporter Maura Judkis. \u201cBut there is no such license at the state level. There\u2019s only dispensary licenses.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nJudkis spoke with chef Andrea Drummer of Lowell Farms to learn about the compromises she\u2019s had to make to open her restaurant. One big one: \u201cThey can\u2019t actually infuse the food,\u201d Judkis says.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "Shane Harris on the whistleblower rattling the intelligence community.
