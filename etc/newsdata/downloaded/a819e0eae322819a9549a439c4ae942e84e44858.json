You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nFor many flights, booking on the day of departure means an absurdly high fare. For a half-hour hop this evening from Heathrow to Manchester, British Airways wants \u00a3371 for the 151-mile journey. (Eurostar does much the same: a standard-class seat from London to Paris costs \u00a3191 on the day.)\n\nIn the 1980s, standby travel was the way to go. Whether you wanted a cheap (ish) seat on a BA SuperShuttle from London to Edinburgh, or a Pan Am flight to New York, Miami or San Francisco, turning up at the airport and hanging around at the ticket desk worked more often than not.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

On the 10,000-mile-plus run from the UK to Australia, there is rarely any disadvantage in buying on the day \u2013 and often you will get an amazing deal.\n\nRight now I am looking at a fare of \u00a3705 return from Heathrow to Sydney, on a flight leaving in three hours.\n\nIt isn\u2019t the most direct trip between the biggest cities in the UK and Australia: the airline is United, and the route includes stops outbound in Washington DC and Los Angeles. Coming back, San Francisco and Houston are the cities where you will be a temporary guest.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t want to sign up without a valid Esta to get you into the US. But if you have, then the transpacific sectors are aboard the Boeing 787, which makes going the long way around bearable.\n\nTravelling in the more usual eastbound direction, choose from Philippine Airlines via Manila for \u00a3845 return, or Cathay Pacific via Hong Kong for \u00a3921.\n\nThe first provides the chance to night-stop in the Filipino capital, which I would relish for an evening out in the fabulous Intramuros walled city and a chance to tackle jet lag early. But Cathay offers an almost Concorde-like performance, under 23 hours, thanks to an 85-minute connection and the fact that the shortest possible route from London to Sydney goes straight over the top of Hong Kong.\n\nIt works from other UK starting points to other Australian cities, too. Manchester-Melbourne? Cathay Pacific pops up again, at just \u00a3849 return on the day, of course via Hong Kong. The inbound flight for my putative return date of 10 September requires an annoying extra stop in Paris, but on other days I dare say you can fly home in just two hops.\n\nSeveral times each week, I read heart-rending messages from travellers who have committed many months in advance to expensive trips, only for events to intervene \u2013 of the non-insurable kind, such as work, family or pre-existing illness.\n\nTo reduce risk and avoid disappointment, book late. Very late. Even over Christmas and new year, the peak time for travel between the UK and Australia, very late bookers can be the people on the plane who have paid least.\n\nThere is one really significant potential downside: serious disruption, whether that is caused by a tropical storm or political upheavals, such as Hong Kong has been experiencing. The closure of Cathay Pacific\u2019s base by demonstrators took out thousands of seats on one of the most favourable airlines between the UK and Australia, precipitating a shortage of capacity that lasted for several days.\n\nBut since Australia is accessible via the western hemisphere, that is not an insurmountable problem.\n\nSure, people tend to like a bit more certainty. And if you are wisely building in a stopover along the way, then probably booking a week ahead is a good plan. But if you just need to get to Australia in the next couple of days, make the most of some amazing prices.", "description": "A colleague asked a simple question with a complex answer: \u201cWhen is the best time to book a flight?\u201d The correct reply is:\u00a0\u201cWell, there\u2019s a fearsomely complex interaction of the route and the time of year.\u201d But for flights from the UK to one specific part of the world, my answer is: around 8am on the day you want to travel.", "authors": ["Simon Calder"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/19/12/Sydney-Harbour-nye.jpg"}
