Newsom in August to pardon his convictions.\n\nLawyer Thomas Sanchez says Segovia Benitez should have been charged with misdemeanors instead of felonies for drug and domestic violence cases.\n\nFor example, he pointed to an assault with a deadly weapon charge that stemmed from Segovia Benitez having a screwdriver in his pocket that wasn't used.\n\nAmong his other convictions were corporal injury to a spouse, for which he received an eight-year sentence, false imprisonment, narcotics possession, conspiracy to commit a crime and driving under the influence, ICE said.", "description": "Jose Segovia Benitez, 38, faces deportation to El Salvador, a country he left at three\u00a0years old.
