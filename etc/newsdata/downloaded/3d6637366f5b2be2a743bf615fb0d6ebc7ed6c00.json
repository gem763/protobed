It\u2019s excruciating pain,\u201d Chamberlain, 27, of West Kingston, R.I., told Fox News on Thursday.\n\nHalloween 2018 was one of the happiest times she remembers spending with Sean, who was 8 months old at the time and was in generally good health, all things considered while undergoing treatment at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\nOREGON DOCTOR SUES OVER DONATED SPERM, SAYS CLINIC USED IT FOR 17 KIDS\n\n\u201cIt was so special because it felt like home. Everyone was dressed up, most of them were children [with cancer],\u201d she said. \u201cHis eyes would light up when he saw them [in costumes].\u201d\n\nChamberlain said she and Sean enjoyed trick-or-treating at the many nurses' stations on the floor.\n\n\u201cHe was such a charmer; he was a really happy little guy,\u201d she said. \u201cThe whole month we watched Halloween movies. We ordered decorations and his room was was decked out like if you had walked into a Halloween store.\u201d\n\nWhen Sean was roughly four months old, he came down with what his pediatrician thought was just a chest cold. But when the young boy\u2019s condition continued to deteriorate, Chamberlain knew something more serious was going on.\n\n\u201cIt was a huge red flag when he didn\u2019t want to breastfeed, but they kept telling me he was fine,\u201d she said.\n\nNEW JERSEY BABY BORN WITH \u2018BRAIN OUTSIDE OF SKULL\u2019 BELIEVED TO BE FIRST TO SURVIVE CONDITION\n\nChamberlain\u2019s mother, a nurse with more than 40 years of experience, also could tell something was seriously sickening her grandson. Another trip to a pediatrician revealed Sean had developed small bruises on his body \u2014 what Chamberlain said she and her family soon learned was a sign of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).\n\nFurther testing led to a formal diagnosis, which was devastating for Chamberlain and her husband, Sean Siegel II, 28.\n\n\"They [doctors] didn\u2019t want to tell me his prognosis, but I wanted to know the facts. Eventually, I found out he had a 40 percent chance [of survival],\u201d she said, noting the percentage slowly decreased as Sean\u2019s treatment continued over the following months.\n\nThe baby's health took a turn for the worse following Halloween, another reason why the candy-filled day now serves as such a happy memory for Chamberlain.\n\nAfter Sean passed, Chamberlain turned to a local rock-painting Facebook group, asking members to help her bring a bit of color to her son\u2019s grave. Many sent her rocks painted with characters from Disney movies and the beloved children\u2019s show \"Sesame Street.\"\n\nNow, she hopes to place Halloween-themed rocks on her late son's grave.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare,\u201d Chamberlain said of seeing Sean\u2019s grave. \u201cBut happy memories soothe [the pain]. The color brings warmth and happiness to the grave; the rocks have helped our family heal. Instead of thinking of death, I think of all the happy times.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nBut Chamberlain also sees the rocks as a way to raise awareness about pediatric cancer and the lack of funding it receives. Though cancer is the No. 1 cause of death by disease among children, only 4 percent of federal cancer research funding goes toward pediatric cancer research, according to the National Pediatric Cancer Foundation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unethical,\u201d said Chamberlain, who documented Sean\u2019s cancer journey on the Facebook page \u201cBaby Sean Strong\u201d and has since used the platform to raise awareness about pediatric cancer. In September, she held a blood drive to commemorate Childhood Cancer Awareness Month.\n\n\u201cThis is more than helping a mother heal after her child died of cancer. This is about raising awareness, even subconsciously,\u201d she continued. \u201cI just hope that when people are painting a rock, they\u2019re not just thinking about Sean. I hope they're thinking about [the lack of funding for] pediatric cancer.\u201d", "description": "Halloween represents much more than just the spookiest day of the year for Hannah Chamberlain, who lost her one-year-old son\u00a0Sean\u00a0to cancer in March.", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
