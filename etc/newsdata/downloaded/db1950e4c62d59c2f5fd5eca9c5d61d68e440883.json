But it seems like just making movies aren't enough for him anymore, he also needs to be pushing the boundaries of technology. And the same goes for 'Gemini Man'.\n\nThe newest movie from Lee is also chock-full of technological pioneering. For one, Ang Lee is shooting in a much higher framerate that pretty much all of the rest of Hollywood, for another, it's also effectively cloning a person for the first time.\n\n'Gemini Man' stars Will Smith in a double role, as 51-year-old assassin Henry, as well as a 23-year-old version of himself. The thing is, any other movie might have just had VFX artists de-age Will Smith in post-production, but there was a snag or two here that required ingenuity.\n\nMore frames, more problems\n\nReuters\n\nDon't Miss 5.8 K SHARES 2.6 K SHARES 3.2 K SHARES 2.4 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES\n\nIt was back during the filming of 2003's 'Hulk' that Lee first felt the pull to abandon film and shoot in digital format. But he was slow to make the full crossover over the next decade, even as the rest of Hollywood moved on. That's because Hollywood shoots in digital but still at 24 fps. Lee instead has been wanting to move to the 120 fps high framerate (HFR) platform, with Gemini Man being just his second attempt at it. It's more hyper-realistic, and in some cases offers far more clarity, especially in action scenes. However, it can also be tiring on the eyes. And because filming techniques have not yet been perfected for the format, it can sometimes look a little ugly when effects are involved.\n\nReal life imitates art, imitates real life\n\nAnother issue is that HFR makes digital effects tougher to implement. Take this movie for instance, which sees Will Smith fighting a younger clone of himself. Normally modelling effects on motion-captured footage is much simpler. Peter Jackson did it with Andy Serkis' character Gollum in the 'Lord of the Rings' Trilogy, in partnership with New Zealand-based Weta Digital. It basically involves having an actor wear a head-mounted camera pointing at their face, as well as reference markers on their face and bodysuit (if they involve full-body effects). The same was done for the James Cameron movie 'Avatar', among others.\n\nBen Rothstein\n\nIn this case however, Ang Lee wasn't looking for surreal effects. He wanted the clone to look exactly like his human counterpart, except younger. One problem with that is that shooting in HFR meant what would otherwise look passably human in regular film formats would here land right in the Uncanny Valley. Additionally, as Weta says, Will Smith has aged too well.\n\nThere weren't enough lines on his face, or indeed any other physical changes to implement. So once they'd done three or four passes, it just didn't look like a version of him 25 years younger. Additionally, the younger clone is supposed to be of a heftier build than the original, which means a lot of remodelling. So instead of just putting a digital mask over old Will Smith, Ang Lee and Weta began working on cloning young Smith from scratch.\n\nCreating life from data\n\nAside from motion capture, they had Will Smith do photo shoots with macro lenses filling an 8K frame, so they could capture minute details of his skin animation, and especially his eyes, the hardest part to digitally recreate. They compiled these photos of him emoting in various ways into a database. Then they got to work outfitting the digital version of his body with a digital skeleton and muscle system, so they could buff him up to the size they needed. They called this clone \"Junior\".\n\nWill Smith's character meets his younger self in this new clip from #GeminiMan.

Once they'd used this data to recreate Junior as a young Will Smith, they popped him into a scene from 1995's Bad Boys, animating him manually, just to see how it looked. And it was wobbly then, but they'd made progress.\n\nThey mapped Smith's teeth, his skin creases and pores, the balance of pigments in his skin and much much more. Eventually, after over a year of long, arduous work, Junior was ready to go to work.\n\n\"God knows we're not saving lives here or anything like that,\" Guy Williams, one of the heads of the Junior team at Weta, told Wired. \"But you have to treat it almost like medicine. You have to be clinical and objective about it.\" And as time went on, he said the level of detail they put into recreating Will Smith became almost ludicrous. \"There are times in this job where you have a roomful of mature, middle-aged people sitting around a monitor, looking at a screen, talking about the amount of shine a pimple should have,\" he laughed.\n\nAll to perfectly clone a man in digital life for the first time.", "description": "Ang Lee has over the years made a name for himself for his groundbreaking cinematography.
