Their injuries were not life-threatening, Mr Sakamaki said.\n\nThe rains caused rivers to swell, flipped anchored boats and whipped up sea waters in a dangerous surge along the coast, flooding some residential neighbourhoods and leaving people to wade in ankle-deep waters.\n\nAuthorities also warned of mudslides, common in mountainous Japan.\n\nRugby World Cup matches, concerts and other events have been cancelled. Flights were grounded and train services halted. Authorities acted quickly, with warnings issued earlier this week, including urging people to stay indoors.\n\nThe typhoon that hit the Tokyo region in 1958 left more than 1,200 people dead and a half-million houses flooded.\n\nSome 17,000 police and military troops have been called up, standing ready for rescue operations.\n\nA woman films surging waves as Typhoon Hagibis approaches at a beach in Kumano, Mie prefecture (Toru Hanai/AP)\n\nHagibis, which means \u201cspeed\u201d in Filipino, was advancing north-northwestward with maximum sustained winds of 100 miles per hour, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency.\n\nIt was expected to make landfall near Tokyo later on Saturday, unleashing up to 20 inches of rains and then blow out to sea eastward.\n\nEvacuation advisories have been issued for risk areas, including Shimoda city, west of Tokyo.\n\nDozens of evacuation centres were opening in coastal towns, and people were resting on gymnasium floors, saying they hoped their homes were still there after the storm passed.\n\nThe storm has disrupted this nation\u2019s three-day weekend, which includes Sports Day on Monday.\n\nQualifying for a Formula One auto race in Suzuka was pushed to Sunday. The Defence Ministry cut a three-day annual navy review to a single day on Monday.\n\nAll Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines grounded most domestic and international flights scheduled at the Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya airports.\n\nCentral Japan Railway Co said it will cancel all bullet train service between Tokyo and Osaka except for several early on Saturday trains connecting Nagoya and Osaka.
