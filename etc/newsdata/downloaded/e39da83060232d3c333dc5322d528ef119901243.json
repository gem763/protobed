It is both one-sided and unfair. And it is basically an echo of what the US has claimed,\" the embassy said in a statement on September 26.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It is true that China, through its own efforts, has made remarkable achievements in economic and social development over the past decades and become the world's second largest economy.\n\n\"However, there is still a big gap between China and the developed countries in terms of overall development level. China still has a long way to go to achieve full modernisation.\"\n\nFortescue is bidding for two iron ore leases in Guinea's Simandou mountains.\n\nMs Gaines said the competitive nature of the bidding process limited her from extrapolating on Fortescue's interest in Guinea, where Rio Tinto found controversy over payments allegedly made to a political lobbyist in 2011.\n\n''We know there is high grade iron ore there ... so it makes sense to look at where those high grade iron ore deposits are,'' she said.\n\n\"At some point those deposits will be developed so having an interest in that we think does make strategic sense.''\n\nRio tried to sell its stake in Simandou to Chinalco in October 2016, but that deal fell through, suggesting Fortescue may have other options for entering Simandou if it fails in the current bidding process.", "description": "Fortescue chief Elizabeth Gaines says China is still developing, in a rejection of Scott Morrison's call for China to be considered a newly developed country.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7548%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_451%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/78f6473eb98f3e882dd673d145d5ebf35c79f163", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
