You are born as you are.\n\n\"It has always been my prority to protect the LGBTQ community I am a part of. Happy Monday!\"\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\nIt all started when she was doing an Instagram live story with her new boyfriend Cody Simpson in which she told her female followers \"you don't have to be gay\".\n\nMiley said: \"Don't give up. You don't have to be gay, there are good people with d**ks out there, you just gotta find them.\n\n\"You just gotta find a d**k that's not a d**k, you know what I mean?\"\n\n(Image: Suzy Creamcheese / SplashNews.com)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nWhile Cody laughed in the background, she added: \"I always thought I had to be gay, because I just thought all guys are evil, but that's not true.\"\n\nMiley received hundreds of angry comments, man branding them \"insulting\" and \"invalidating\".\n\nBut even after she clarified what she meant, many weren't so quick to forgive her.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nOne tweeted: \"I understood your intentions but it still came off wrong and made some people feel s****y. Thank you for clarifying of course but please just try to be more aware of what you are saying and how you are saying it in the future.\"\n\nAnother posted: \"So many of us smilers LOVE her and felt like her comments were biphobic. She has a HUGE base in the LGBTQA community and it's important for her to clarify her words.\"\n\nA third said: \"We know you were joking, but it still came out bad.\"", "description": "The Wrecking Ball singer, 26, took to Twitter to say that it's her 'priority to protect the LGBTQ community'", "authors": ["Molly Pike", "Image", "Instagram", "Twitter", "Suzy Creamcheese", "Splashnews.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20664138.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Miley-Cyrus.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
