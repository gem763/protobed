[CHOI GYU-SEOK, NEXT ENTERTAINMENT WORLD]\n\nWriting on a blank sheet of paper can be difficult, even terrifying for some. But not for director and a storyteller Yeon Sang-ho, who believes that anyone can cook up a story.Those with keen eyes may have noticed a new web comic series on Korea\u2019s top portal site Naver that is being published under familiar names: Yeon, the director of the hit film \u201cTrain to Busan,\u201d and the popular cartoonist Choi Gyu-seok, the author of the popular web comics \u201cGimlet.\u201d The duo are collaborating on a new web comic titled \u201cThe Hell.\u201dThe story is set in the present, but in a society where mysterious and horrifying creatures act as grim reapers to take \u201cbad\u201d people to hell, giving them an exact date and time when they will be picked up. The story derives from Yeon\u2019s 2003 short animated series of the same title, in which people live in a society where they are aware that heaven and hell really exist. The angels foretell those who are about to die and announce whether they would be placed in heaven or hell based on their good deeds or crimes while living on earth and what degree of punishment they will be enduring if they end up in the latter.\u201cThese days, I want to try out anything that I find it interesting or entertaining,\u201d said Yeon in the interview with the Korea JoongAng Daily. The press had a chance to sit down with the director and got to hear from horse\u2019s mouth all about his latest works, including his webtoon series \u201cThe Hell,\u201d his sequel to the \u201cTrain to Busan\u201d (2016) as well as his debut as a scriptwriter for the upcoming drama series \u201cThe Cursed\u201d (tentatively titled).The following are edited excerpts from the interview.I\u2019ve been friends with Choi for a long time. We were drinking beer two years ago, and the idea just came up. We\u2019ve never collaborated together and so we thought about creating another story out of my previous animation \u201cThe Hell.\u201d So, I wrote the script, and we met like twice a week to brainstorm and expand the plot. Our aim was to just have a chance to work together and fool around.I\u2019ve always loved comics, and I like Choi\u2019s work as well. Although comics take a lot of time and effort, [I think] it\u2019s the most convenient medium that creators can make because we aren\u2019t working off someone else\u2019s money or investment. It was too good of an opportunity to pass up because I really admire Choi\u2019s works.Since we have both of our names in print, our tastes are more evenly distributed when [it was just me directing]. Before, Choi used to design the characters for me, and based on that character design, I would work with other illustrators to create the rest of my works, like my other animated works \u201cThe King of Pigs\u201d (2011) and \u201cThe Fake\u201d (2013). But this time, Choi was the director and I was the scriptwriter. It was my first time to write for someone else.I hope the comic can become one of those pieces of art that throws a question into the world. We think that we live in a very rational world but in some aspects [of society] we go back to primitive or theocratic states in the blink of an eye. So I wanted to paint a world in which we could return to a society that believes in divinity, [but ironically], we get there through rationality.As the animated film spread on the Internet, people around me became interested in its cinematic universe. They have been suggesting that there could be other stories waiting to be told from within the universe. I also like omnibus novels, dramas and films, and one of the old American TV series that I loved was \u201cThe Twilight Zone.\u201d It\u2019s like today\u2019s \u201cBlack Mirror,\u201d and I thought I could maybe spin a series of stories like that with \u201cThe Hell.\u201dSo it\u2019s not as much as writing the prequel to my previous films, but to really construct a new universe. I think I approached the comics with a fresh eye and mind. It might sound far-fetched, but I wanted to create a series like Star Wars that I could live off from for, let\u2019s say, 20 years from now on. A story where more stories can continue to proliferate, which is also connected to the reason why I chose the medium of comics. I personally like them as well, but in the case of Japanese comics, they can run for 10 years. It\u2019s totally different from movies. Films are released, and they are out in theaters for only a brief period of time, so I thought it was more convenient financially to expand my imagination in the comics.As for \u201cThe Hell,\u201d we just started to publish them serially, so I think it will take about a year to finish the first part and another year to finish the second part.I believe it does. I jot down notes about my views, feelings and experiences, and the stories are created when they meet a proper fable. I think the most important factor in creating a story is when what the creator feels combines with a good fable to create a natural story.When I was younger, I thought that only bad, horrible things existed in the world. And that is how I saw it as well. For instance, when I saw a touching story or something good on television, they felt strange and surreal to me. I believed that they were all lies. But as I got older, I think my perspective changed a bit. I think this generation is transitioning into one where one tries to make a better place for people to live in it rather than just complaining about it.I don\u2019t think it\u2019s important that the world becomes a zombie world or not. That doesn\u2019t decide the happy endings, and it actually connects with the message I want to give in my sequel \u201cThe Peninsula\u201d too. It\u2019s more important to see how people live and their mindsets [rather than the environment]. We may live unhappily in a good world or vice versa. For some people, they may not believe that the film ended on a hopeful note, like I used to when I was young. But I would rather want [the audience] to get a positive message [than negative].If we probe deeper into it, it\u2019s endless to discuss whether or not the ending is positive or negative. There can be so many perspectives about how people view the story, and it\u2019s mostly about which phase I would choose to end the story to generate certain kinds of opinions or thoughts. As all artworks go, I think that what kind of discussions arise from the film is what\u2019s important. The end isn\u2019t really the end. So it\u2019s trivial to me whether or not the film has a bad or happy ending.Actually, I think that anyone can write stories. I don\u2019t think stories can be judged or defined whether or not their narratives are strong or weak. There are stories that don\u2019t really fit into what normal people think are logical. Of course, they won\u2019t be commercially successful, but for me, I like some of those genre\u2019s novels and comics because they are unusual or eccentric. Those kinds of minor works also have a power, like Albert Camus\u2019s novel \u201cThe Stranger.\u201d I admire those stories with strong personal views that may not be understood by the masses. I also wanted to try to write a novel that wouldn\u2019t have been understood by the majority, but I couldn\u2019t. Actually, in January 2018, I published a graphic novel \u201cThe Face,\u201d but not many people know about it.As for how I write my stories, although I chose writing as one of my professions, I don\u2019t write that well or have any particular method or standard [on writing]. I mean, when looking at writing as a form of art, I can\u2019t write like an experienced writer. I lack the linguistic skills and literacy to do that. But anyone can write a story if they know how to type or know words. That\u2019s what makes the writing so appealing to me.My inspirations these days come from what I used to like when I was young. I think about why I used to like \u201cThe Twilight Zone\u201d so much before and what aspects attracted or excited me. I think it\u2019s important that people get to feel the thrill that I\u2019d felt when I came across something that I\u2019d liked so much, so I\u2019m trying to recover those feelings.Before, I was focused on what kind of message I want to share or technical things, but now I\u2019m trying to recreate the excitement that I\u2019d felt when I was a kid. So I\u2019m looking through old films and comic books, like \u201cThe Terminator 2\u201d (1991). That came out when I was in middle school, and I remember feeling so excited to see the film in theaters.It\u2019s an occult series about shamanism. While \u201cThe Hell\u201d is centered more on religion, this is more about local shamanism. When we think of the occult genre, exorcism based on the Catholic Church is really well-organized and depicted. Of course, there are films like \u201cThe Wailing\u201d (2016), but I wanted a more local occult genre series to be produced. In Japan, there are films like the \u201cJu-on\u201d series that spun some really good stuff out of ghost stories, but I don\u2019t think the local occult genre is developed like that. While I thought maybe someone else could develop the genre, a drama production insider suggested that I try writing a drama script. So I did.Although writing out scripts for episodes was definitely longer, I had fun because it was like publishing my own web novel series. [At first] I started writing without any intention to show it to someone. But I showed them around as I wrote out more episodes, and the response [ I got] wasn\u2019t that bad. So I told [the insider] about it, and the company decided to produce it into a drama series.I want to publish a picture book someday - I also preferred books with pictures more than books without them when I was young. The picture books were like a primitive form of entertainment where one could visualize the story and the words together before films were created. Recently in the United States, a picture book titled \u201cThe Electric State\u201d was published last year. For it, the famous illustrator Simon Stalenhag published a collection of his paintings and a story into a picture book. It can be enjoyed by everyone, just like \u201cGundam\u201d or \u201cStar Wars,\u201d so if there is an interesting enough story to turn into a picture book, it would be fun to try it out.BY LEE JAE-LIM [lee.jaelim@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/06200846.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
