This, in theory, would allow goods to move over the Irish border freely and without the need for customs checks.\n\nRead more: Surge in campaign donations from US poultry lobby as Trump pushes for Brexit trade deal with UK\n\nHowever, while the EU is willing to discuss the proposal, officials in Brussels reportedly believe it does not go far enough, relies upon untested technologies, and will take weeks to flesh out.\n\nThe EU has highlighted a handful of problems with Johnson's proposals, according to Tony Connelly, Europe editor at Irish publication RTE.\n\nUnder Johnson's plan, goods that go from Great Britain to Northern Ireland and stay in Northern Ireland will be charged the EU tariff, meaning importers must claim for rebates if the UK tariff \u2014 the correct charge \u2014 is lower.\n\nHowever, the EU believes the rebate system is complex and could take years to design, Connelly reports. The EU is also waiting for the UK to explain how goods will be tracked under these proposed arrangements.\n\nAn EU diplomatic source quoted in The Guardian newspaper said it would now be \"impossible\" for the UK to leave on October 31 with a \"totally new concept\" such as the new proposals put forward by Johnson over the weekend.\n\nThe question marks over the UK proposals mean that even if Johnson and other EU leaders agree a deal at the European Council summit this week, the latter will likely conclude it cannot be delivered by October 31.\n\nJohnson has repeatedly insisted that the UK will leave the EU on October 31 and said he would rather be \"dead in a ditch\" than ask EU leaders to delay Britain's exit again.\n\nHowever, under the terms of the Benn act passed by members of Parliament last month, the prime minister is compelled by law to request another extension to Article 50 if he cannot secure a deal by the end of this week.", "description": "Hopes are beginning to fade that Johnson's government will be able to negotiate and ratify a new deal by the end of October.", "authors": ["Adam Payne"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da423ec4af90902025601b2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
