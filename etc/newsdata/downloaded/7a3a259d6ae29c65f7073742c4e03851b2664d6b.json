The risk, in my view, with Brexit is that there will be differential impact on the one hand on the intelligence relationships, and on the other the law enforcement agencies.\u201c\n\nBritish police face losing access to core databases including the Schengen Information System, which holds details of terrorists and criminals wanted throughout Europe, and the European Arrest Warrant system.\n\nEuropol, a pan-EU policing body, is used to conduct joint operations against international extremist and organised crime groups, and to pool intelligence.\n\nLord Evans said it was \"absolutely vital\" that close links with Europol remain.\n\n\"It's hard to imagine that we will be in quite such a good place after Brexit but we need to do our best to compensate for any deficit,\" he added.\n\nLord Evans also suggested the UK would also suffer from being cut out of EU policy-making on security, saying that for decades Britain has countered a \u201cdisproportionate interest in data protection issues in some part of the EU\u201d.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
