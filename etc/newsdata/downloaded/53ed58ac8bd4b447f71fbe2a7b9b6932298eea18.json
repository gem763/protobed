This production came in addition to the increase in production and export capacity from the KRG, he said.", "description": "OPEC's second-largest crude producer is often labeled the group's 'problem child' for chronically overproducing.", "authors": ["Natasha Turak"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106121637-1568123934591gettyimages-1139270236.jpg?v=1568124187", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
