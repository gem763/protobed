There were 39 people on board the ship at the time of the accident. Twenty-six people remain unaccounted for.\n\n\"I could hear some voices, so I put on a pair of shorts, walked to the door, and I see this boat out there all on fire, totally engulfed,\" said Bob Hansen, who owns The Grape Escape. \"Thirty foot flames, at least -- a 75-foot boat and it was on fire from one end to the other. It looked like it had port holes down below deck and you could see fire through the holes.\"\n\n\"You can only imagine the horror,\" he added.\n\nFour bodies have been recovered, while four others have been located on the sea floor, according to Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown. Two adult men and two adult women were recovered. They do not have identities of those bodies that were recovered and some may take DNA analysis to confirm.\n\nThe instability of the boat, lying upside down on the bottom of the water, is making further recovery difficult, the sheriff said.\n\nVentura County officials \"fear numerous fatalities\" as rescue operations continue, public information officer Bill Nash told ABC News.\n\n(MORE: Coast Guard suspends search for firefighters who went missing off Florida coast)\n\nCrew members said that three groups celebrating birthdays -- including that of a 17-year-old -- were aboard the vessel.\n\nCapt. Monica Rochester, U.S. Coast Guard Los Angeles Long Beach Sector Commander, said the crew members were awake at the time of the fire and jumped off of the boat into the water.\n\n\"One of the fellows had a broken leg; he was in extreme pain,\" Hansen said.\n\nPHOTO: A boat burns off the coast of Santa Cruz Island, Calif., Sept. 2, 2019.

However, the fire happened overnight in pitch black, and the sleeping quarters were below deck. Nash said they \"greatly fear loss of life here.\"\n\nEmergency calls showed the desperation of those on board.\n\n\"I can't breathe,\" one passenger aboard the boat engulfed in flames near Santa Cruz Island said while making a mayday call.\n\nCrews from the Coast Guard, Santa Barbara Fire Department, Ventura County Fire Department and Vessel Assist responded to a mayday call that was heard at about 3:15 a.m.\n\n\"The fire department crews were fighting the fire when the vessel sank 20 yards off shore in 64 feet of water,\" according to a statement from the Coast Guard.\n\nPHOTO: The Ventura County Fire Department at the scene of a boat fire off the coast off Santa Cruz, Calif., Sept. 2, 2019. (Ventura County Fire Department) More\n\n\"The vessel was reported as being on fire,\" the Los Angeles office of the U.S. Coast Guard tweeted earlier Monday. They added that \"a group of crew members has been rescued (one with minor injuries) and efforts continue to evacuate the remaining passengers.\"\n\nRochester said the vessel was in \"full compliance.\"\n\nThe cause of the fire is still under investigation, but said there was no reason to suspect criminality.\n\n(MORE: Hope fades for 21 missing after Budapest boat crash as other ship's captain arrested)\n\n\"We are working deliberately with the vessel owner/operator, who is with us at the time working on a plan to conduct further assistance for his vessel,\" she said.\n\nStory continues", "description": "More than two dozen people remain missing after eight bodies were found in the water near a 75-foot commercial diving boat that caught fire early Monday morning off Santa Cruz Island, California, sending the crew diving overboard and kick-starting a desperate rescue effort, according to authorities.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Thomas", "Alexandra Svokos"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/O0DL.ThXEdYp4XZ8BHLd3A--~B/aD01NTg7dz05OTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/gma/us.abcnews.gma.com/boat-fire-3-gty-er-190902_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
