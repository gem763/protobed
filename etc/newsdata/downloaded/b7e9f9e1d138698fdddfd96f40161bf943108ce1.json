Got a question for Polly? Email askpolly@nymag.com. Photo: Germ\u00e1n Vogel/Getty Images\n\nDear Polly,\n\nRecently I tried to discuss the option of coming out to my grandfather with my sisters. They were supportive at first. They called a day later, together, to tell me that after thinking about it and discussing it, they think it is a bad idea. They told me that they think it will go down a worst-case-scenario route. Our grandpa is a preacher in the South. They have heard him speak disparagingly about the LGBTQ community. My mother, they said, would also pitch a fit. She does not want me to come out to anyone in my extended family or hometown.\n\nThey also let me know that if I did tell my grandpa, they would have to step away, because of the drama it would cause. One of my sisters is pregnant. I understand that she has a right to be selfish right now. They say they have tried to advocate for me to my parents, and that me rocking the boat again by telling Grandpa is too soon, and will be too much for them to handle. They say I need to be patient and let everyone have time.\n\nI know I need to dig deep to understand why I want to continue coming out to folks who I know won\u2019t be receptive, or who aren\u2019t ready. I know it\u2019s possible that I\u2019m motivated in part by the feeling of acceptance I crave, and I\u2019m probably trying to alleviate the pain I feel in knowing I\u2019m only partially accepted. I want to be able to be myself fully. I can\u2019t endure another Christmas where I can only smile and say small white lies or half-truths about my life. Even before I had come out to, well, myself, I was a fierce advocate. As a teenager, I would yell and fight, but as an adult I learned, mostly, how to advocate more gently, so that folks might actually listen. Now, because it is me who needs the advocating, I don\u2019t know how to have a voice. I want to scream, and stomp, and storm \u2014 that they are my family and they promised to love me unconditionally and they broke that promise. I also want to hide, become small, and have them open their arms and tell me that they are sorry and they understand that it\u2019s not my fault. I want to get on my knees and beg forgiveness and say that I know that my coming out hurt them, but it\u2019s not something I can change.\n\nInstead, I listen to them talk about the weather, and ultrasounds, and new cars, or a new task at work, and just play nice. I tell them about the weather or my dog. I try to mention my girlfriend, but the silence the mention is met with is deafening.\n\nMy family thinks that I am selfish. And immoral. And that my gayness is a phase or the result of my depression. I\u2019ve always been \u201ctoo much\u201d for them. A running joke in the family is, \u201cWhat will she cry about this Christmas?\u201d\n\nAm I an insane person to continue to try to make them hear me? I don\u2019t want to cause \u201cdrama,\u201d I just want to be me. I just want to bring my girlfriend down for a visit. I just want to post pictures of me and my girlfriend without blocking half of my tiny hometown to make my mother comfortable.\n\nAnd this is about so much more than me being gay. I have always craved a different kind of relationship than anyone in my nuclear family has been willing to give. They have a right to that, I guess. They have a right to feel that I\u2019m too much. My mother told me she couldn\u2019t handle the \u201croller coaster of my life.\u201d\n\nShould I simply give up trying to make them accept me? Should I be more accepting of them and their limitations? I\u2019ll be an aunt soon and I don\u2019t want to be cut out of their lives, but I don\u2019t want to live as a ghost in theirs either.\n\n\n\nFucking Hopeless and Brokenhearted\n\nDear FHAB,\n\nOuch. I get it, I really do. When you wrote, \u201cI want to scream, and stomp, and storm \u2014 that they are my family and they promised to love me unconditionally and they broke that promise,\u201d I really felt that, and it hurt. I spent so many years wanting to take my family by the shoulders and shake them, to set shit on fire, to rage and cry and make them understand me. But I need for you to listen to me very closely when I tell you this: It won\u2019t work. You need to stop returning to the same empty well, looking for water.\n\nThere is no water here. You can be TOO MUCH in every other part of your life, forever and ever \u2014 commit to it, live out in the open, do what you do unapologetically, scream it to the moon and back \u2014 without spending another hour sobbing by that empty well.\n\nNow if this were JUST about coming out, I would say, \u201cYes, come out. Wait until your sister has her kid, and then do it.\u201d If all you wanted was to come out, announce yourself, make your identity known, and that\u2019s it, I would encourage that. But what you want is much more complicated than that, isn\u2019t it? You want your family to see you clearly for the first time. You want them to hear your words. You want them to treat you the way you deserve to be treated. You want them to accept you for exactly who you are. You want them to meet your girlfriend, and accept her, too. You want to stand up and deliver a moving speech about who you are and what you want from this world, and then you want your Grandpa to stand up and cheer for you, and you want everyone to give you hugs and cry and celebrate this glorious day together.\n\nAnd why wouldn\u2019t you want that? Who wouldn\u2019t want that? The problem is, what you want is a fantasy. Your sisters already know that, which is why they\u2019re trying to warn you ahead of time. Your family didn\u2019t accept you even before they knew you were gay. They\u2019ve always seen you as too much. They\u2019ve always lived in fear of your heavy statements and your tears.\n\nThey\u2019re just people. A lot of people are like that. A lot of people want to talk about the weather and lunch and ultrasounds and new cars and job stuff. A lot of people never, ever, want to talk about the heavy shit you\u2019re going through \u2014 never, ever, ever.\n\nIf you could show up and be too much without feeling ashamed of yourself, then I\u2019d say go ahead, show up and be too much. But you\u2019re still ashamed. You\u2019re still afraid. You still need a lot \u2014 way more than anyone in your family can give you. And you\u2019re still in denial about what they can and can\u2019t give you. It seems like most of your family knows that you\u2019re gay, but you still want to come out to the one person who\u2019s sure to reject you for it. That\u2019s the kind of choice you make when you\u2019re grappling with your own shame and insecurity. I\u2019m not blaming you for that, I\u2019m just telling you that you won\u2019t always feel compelled to take this action. The path to peace doesn\u2019t necessarily lead straight to your Grandpa\u2019s door.\n\nYou need to take a minute. Because even though your sisters are saying, \u201cPlease just let it go, there\u2019s a lot going on, this is bad timing and it won\u2019t go well, we need this as a favor from you at a fragile time,\u201d you\u2019re a little obsessed with telling him, aren\u2019t you? You want them to OPEN THEIR ARMS TO YOU. You\u2019re craving a feeling of being truly, unconditionally loved. I understand that, I really do. And like many emotional people who were never fully supported as children but who\u2019re smart and persuasive verbally, you\u2019re sure that IF YOU JUST EXPLAIN IT ALL REALLY WELL, your nightmare family will transform before your eyes into a fantasy family.\n\nBut that\u2019s not how it works. Your fantasy of being accepted is actually CREATED BY YOUR SHAME. I know that because I was like that, too. I thought I could just coax everyone in my family into behaving differently. I can coax my family gently NOW, a decade later. But you know what it took to get here? Ten goddamn years of reliably talking about the weather, and ultrasounds, and new cars. I had to play nice for ten years, motherfucker. I had to shut up and go with the flow. I had to smile along. I had to stop being way too much and getting mad when no one liked it. I had to stop demanding more. I had to stop returning to the empty well.\n\nAnd I had to address my shame and my fears about myself and my anger at myself. I had to do that in order to be heard and to be seen. I had to be very patient, and I had to give MYSELF the unconditional love that I was craving from them.\n\nI know that\u2019s not what you want to hear. If I were you, hearing that would probably make me angry. I\u2019d probably say, \u201cFuck you, you\u2019re straight, what do you know?\u201d And you should look to the LGBTQ community for more answers if you haven\u2019t already, because there are many, many different perspectives on this. Plenty of people will tell you to do what you feel, and your family can either catch up or go fuck themselves.\n\nPersonally, though, I think the fact that you want to return to the emptiest well of all \u2014 your ideologically rigid Grandpa \u2014 is a real tell. You\u2019ve tricked yourself into believing that all you want is to live your truth, out loud. But really, you want a response. You don\u2019t just want love. A part of you wants rejection. You want to knock down these rotten walls, so you have a solid excuse for just walking away, thereby releasing yourself from the pain of this rejection forever.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think forcing the issue and walking away from your family will improve your life right now. I think patience and refocusing on your relationship with yourself will improve your life. I think once you give yourself the compassion you need, you won\u2019t need as much compassion from your family. You might even be able to give them YOUR unconditional love. I know that sounds a little empty at the moment, but once you land there, it feels really good.\n\nUnfortunately, when you\u2019re emotionally starved, the empty well becomes a big part of your religion. God, how I loved to cry at that empty well! I loved to peer down into it, and sob, and feel terrible for myself. This was true because I was so mean to myself the rest of the time. I was drowning in self-pity in those empty-well moments because the rest of my day was just me punishing and scolding myself for fucking up, over and over again. I was plastered in shame. I needed a way to feel some compassion for myself. The empty well gave me that. And my magical thinking told me that my family could release me from my shame \u2014 by loving me, by accepting me, by hearing me, by seeing me.\n\nThat was a fantasy. My family was not capable of doing that job. Likewise, your relatives are the exact wrong people for this job you keep trying to get them to do. They are saying to you, very directly, \u201cWe are bad at this. We can\u2019t do it.\u201d Are they assholes? Did they grow up in a fucked-up culture? Are they terrible? Should they be excised from your life forever?\n\nI don\u2019t think so. I mean, they might be terrible. They\u2019re certainly infuriating and unfair. But they\u2019re also familiar to me: They\u2019re typical humans. They hate heaviness and they don\u2019t love unconventional choices and they want to be safe from your drama. They fear emotions and emotional confrontation more than you or I could ever understand. It\u2019s not just revulsion, it\u2019s RAW FEAR.\n\nSo even though they\u2019re a little pathetic, show them the mercy that they won\u2019t show you. Forgive them for this in ways that they won\u2019t forgive you for being who you are. Your ability to do that is contingent on your ability to forgive yourself.\n\nForgive yourself for what? For being you. For being different. For not doing the dishes this morning. For running late to work again. For being messy and emotional. For caring too much. For crying a lot. For having so many unpredictable layers and moods. For feeling lost a lot. For not fitting in well. For not shutting up quickly. For needing more. For being too much. For being not enough. For being.\n\nYou blame yourself for everything. You know that, right? It\u2019s not your fault. It started with them, the message that you weren\u2019t enough. But now you\u2019re repeating it to yourself, every day. That\u2019s why you\u2019re seeking absolution from your family. That\u2019s why you\u2019re living inside a fantasy of their forgiveness and love. But you don\u2019t need their love and acceptance to feel free.\n\nOnce I addressed my shame thoroughly and worked hard to accept my family for who they were, I wasn\u2019t triggered by them nearly as often or as dramatically. I stopped looking for sustenance from them. I stopped telling them things they couldn\u2019t handle. I stopped trying to herd them in directions they didn\u2019t want to go. I let them take up space the way they wanted to, and I listened. With my mother in particular, I made a very active choice not to push her anymore. She was getting older and I was terrorizing her, essentially, with my emotional agenda. It wasn\u2019t fair. Whatever her limitations and personal boundaries and slightly withholding tendencies happened to be at the time, she had a right to be who she already was. Why did I insist, so fervently, that I had a right to be me, if I couldn\u2019t extend her the same right?\n\nI made a choice to accept her for who she was. I made a choice to stop hurting myself by returning to that empty well. I refocused my energy on showing up and trying to be of service, to be a friend, to be supportive, without constantly focusing on my own needs. I vowed to stop setting shit on fire.\n\nI know that it\u2019s much harder to accept family members with hateful attitudes about being gay. Why should you, really? You have lots of good reasons for wanting to take your family by the shoulders and shake them, hard. Just keep in mind that sometimes when people are afraid of you and your emotions, they can\u2019t calm down enough to hear you. And once you stop needing them to hear you, that\u2019s when they start listening.\n\nDo an experiment. For the next year, stop pushing them. Just show up and be present. Ask questions about their jobs. Ask your sister about her pregnancy. When your emotions come up, though, serve yourself by getting some distance. Go for shorter visits, and when you do visit, spend time with yourself and treat yourself with care. Respect your limits. Make sure that even though you can\u2019t get what you need from them, you will give yourself what you need, no matter what. Protect yourself more.\n\nRight now, you\u2019re giving too much to them and you\u2019re furious at them all the time. Give yourself more. Give them less. But let go of your anger as much as you can.\n\nIf you do that, I think you\u2019ll be surprised at how much better you feel. And you\u2019ll be amazed at how much more relaxed and kind your family is to you, once they aren\u2019t afraid of you anymore. Stop explaining yourself to them and let them solve these puzzles on their own instead. You might just see them slowly start to give you more \u2014 more attention, more understanding, more respect.\n\nIs that a fantasy? I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019ve seen it happen many times. You give other people your respect, you let them take up space, you ask them questions about their challenges and fears, you enjoy their company \u2014 even when it\u2019s a little trivial-seeming and small-talky \u2014 and suddenly they shift their attitudes toward you.\n\nIt\u2019s not that there aren\u2019t triggers now and then. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re not VERY SAD at times, that you can\u2019t get exactly what you want and need. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s super fucking easy to be around your family without spontaneously combusting. Family is hard, full stop.\n\nBut don\u2019t mix together the inherent trials of family life with the built-in challenges of coming out. Don\u2019t throw in your shame and confusion and anger and self-hatred until you can\u2019t tell what\u2019s what. Separate these things from each other. Seek clarity. And above all, be patient.\n\nBecause your family is never going to bring you emotional salvation, not today and not in the future. You have to find peace without them. Enlist your friends and your girlfriend in this work. Talk to a therapist about these things. Write this stuff down. Write a poem, write a song, write a book! IT IS YOUR JOB TO BE TOO MUCH, right here, right now. Celebrate exactly who you are, without shame. That will make you stronger, and it will matter more than anyone else\u2019s acceptance or approval.\n\nEven if your family does forgive you and love you exactly the way you want to be loved TODAY, it won\u2019t come close to what you\u2019ll gain from simply loving and forgiving yourself. BECAUSE YOU ARE THE ONE WITH THE WATER IN YOUR WELL. Once you discover that, you\u2019ll never go back to begging and weeping and groveling to people who can\u2019t help you.\n\nShould you come out to all of them eventually? Should you reveal yourself to your entire hometown at some point? Maybe. But until you thoroughly accept yourself for who you are, without shame, I think that will be a rough road. My sense is that you need more time.\n\nAs long as the empty well makes you cry, and as long as you return to it compulsively and obsess about it and fantasize about it as THE SOLUTION TO EVERYTHING, you have reason to question your motives. These small-minded people should not be your focus right now. Fixating on them and their limitations is beneath you. Can you feel that?\n\nHave mercy on them instead. Your emotions are creating an illusion that you\u2019re the beggar, you\u2019re the thirsty one, you\u2019re the lost one. But the truth is, they need your help more than you need theirs.\n\nPolly\n\nPolly\u2019s evil twin Molly has a newsletter; sign up here.
