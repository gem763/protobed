Add Interest\n\n\u201cWe are running a limited test where like, reaction and video view counts are made private across Facebook,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement. \"We will gather feedback to understand whether this change will improve people\u2019s experiences.\u201d\n\nThe like counts will be private and only visible to the author of the post. The company hopes the move will help users focus on the quality of the photos of videos they share rather than just focus on how many others like it.\n\nFacebook tested removing the like count Thursday in Australia, and it could soon expand elsewhere depending on how it is received and how people engage with it.\n\nThe move is similar to what Facebook-owned Instagram tested earlier this year as a way to combat cyber bullying.\n\nFacebook\n\nWhile the move was lauded by many as a way to prevent social-media related anxieties, it sent some members of the \"influencer\" community who rely on likes and followers to earn money, reeling.\n\n\u201cMany influencers didn\u2019t actually think that Instagram was going to move forward with completely removing likes from the platform,\" Ronn Torossian, a crisis management expert and the CEO of the 5W Public Relations firm in New York told ABC News in a statement Friday.\n\nTorossian argued that removing likes is not necessarily about reducing pressure users feel on the platform, but more about getting ad revenue.\n\n\"Now that they have made it clear that this initiative is going to continue, some influencers are panicking and looking to new ways to bring in revenue. The reality is, Instagram is removing likes not only to reduce the pressure users feel, but to force users to spend money on ads if they want their posts to be seen,\" he said. \"Organic content is no longer going to cut it \u2013 if these influencers want to continue to grow their audience, paid ads are about to be the best way to do so.\u201d\n\nOne influencer, however, argued that removing likes on the platform could be a positive step -- especially for young women -- even though she acknowledges that she has used the platform to advance her career.\n\nAlexa Galante, known on Instagram as XO Bunny, told \"Good Morning America\" earlier this month that she thinks removing likes is \"a great idea to reduce cyber-bullying.\"\n\n\"Removing Instagram likes would allow users to focus on content and not be concerned with the amount of likes the photo gets,\" Galante added. \"Girls are very competitive in general, so if a girl has more likes than me on a pic with a similar following, I will definitely try and outdo her on the next post.\"", "description": "Some say this will help with social media-related anxiety, others say it will hurt the influencer industry.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/facebook-likes-hidden-ht-ps-190927_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
