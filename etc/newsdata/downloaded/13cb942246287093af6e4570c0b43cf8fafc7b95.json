'My dad still cracks me up telling me about the time he did some teaching in Salt Lake City and told his school students he wanted to see a pen, pencil and a rubber on each of their desks the next day.'\n\nA second joked: 'We call them rubbers in the UK too. I\u2019ve still got my childhood rubber collection \u2014 that\u2019s not a sentence that goes down well in America.'\n\nAnother joked how they'd cause confusion by using the term 'clothes horse' earlier in the week (pictured)\n\nAnd it seems the US word 'suspenders,' gave Brits the wrong impression for many years too - since it means something rather different here.\n\n'In a very amusing conversation an older lady told me in great detail about finding the right suspenders for her grandson for his wedding,' penned one.\n\n'I finally realised that braces were called suspenders in the US. The conversation made much more sense after this revelation.'\n\nAnother joked: 'I grew up thinking that American men were quite kinky because of the suspenders thing!'\n\nMeanwhile, other popular items to initiate confusion include traffic cones and road signs.\n\n'Painted give way triangles are called shark's teeth in The Netherlands,' wrote one, while a second added: 'They're called that on the Faroe Islands too.'\n\nA further penned: 'In Australia we call traffic cones \u201cwitches hats\u201d and I\u2019ve only just realised how insane that is,' while a fourth commented:\n\n'And Americans park on a driveway, and drive on a parkway. Madness.'", "description": "Richard Osman, 48, took to Twitter to explain how he confused an American woman after using the British phrases 'zebra crossings' and 'lollipop ladies' - and joked even he didn't have an explanation.", "authors": ["Chloe Morgan For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/14/20282930-0-image-a-26_1572272398219.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
