The U.S. wants to extradite Meng after accusing her and others at Huawei of conspiring to trick banks into conducting more than $100 million of transactions that may have violated American sanctions. The company has denied it committed any violations.\n\nRead more: Huawei Accuses U.S. of Harassing Workers, Attacking Network (1)\n\nMeng\u2019s team aims to show there was an abuse of process, which if successful, could result in the judge ordering a halt to the extradition proceedings. In a current round of disclosure hearings set to run through Oct. 4, Meng also seeks a court order to force the Canadian government to share more details about the circumstances of her arrest. Huawei spokesman Benjamin Howes declined to comment on Monday\u2019s proceedings as the case is currently ongoing. The company has previously accused American authorities of harassing its employees, without saying how it obtained that information.\n\nMeng showed up to court Monday in a glamorous outfit replete with four-inch sparkly heels that exposed the GPS monitor on her left ankle -- one of the conditions of her C$10 million bail ($7.5 million). She was accompanied by her husband Xiaozong Liu, also known as Carlos, who could be seen occasionally nodding off in the public gallery during the lengthy proceedings.\n\nAmong the arguments Meng\u2019s defense put forth Monday were:\n\nThat Canadian border officials -- working with Canadian police and the FBI -- deliberately delayed Meng\u2019s arrest at the airport for three hours, using the pretext of a customs inspection to obtain access to her electronic devices and interrogate her.That U.S. authorities historically have misused border checks to scrutinize Huawei executives\u2019 electronic devices. The lawyers cited a former company employee whose devices were seized or searched by U.S. airport authorities numerous times between 2013 and 2018. The defense plans to call as a witness a special agent who conducted one of those searches.Her defense questioned how the FBI obtained details from outside its jurisdiction about what Meng was wearing on the flight from Hong Kong before it landed.\n\nRead more: Huawei CFO Awakens Canadians to the Long, Strong Arm of China\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a question of pulling out all the stops,\u201d said Gary Botting, a Vancouver-based lawyer who\u2019s been involved in hundreds of Canadian extradition cases and watched part of Monday\u2019s proceedings.\n\nMeng\u2019s defense is likely trying to show that Canadian authorities collected evidence and statements irrelevant to the extradition proceedings but \u201cwill no doubt be considered gold by the FBI, who will likely use them in an attempt to bolster their case against her in the Eastern District of New York,\u201d Botting said.\n\n(Updates with Huawei\u2019s view from the 4th paragraph.
