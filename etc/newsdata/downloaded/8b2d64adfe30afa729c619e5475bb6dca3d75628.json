As well as ESPN, it is also the parent company of television giant ABC.\n\n\u201cEvery deal that we\u2019re negotiating right now we are looking at how do we acquire rights not just for the linear package but for ESPN+,\u201d ESPN President Jimmy Pitaro told Bloomberg in May.\n\nWarnerMedia is also a sporting heavyweight and has already secured the digital rights to several events, including college basketball, which is massively popular in the United States.\n\nEven if Disney and WarnerMedia offer sports with their online video services they are unlikely to make all of their content available on a streaming platform, analysts say.\n\nThat is because traditional television, despite suffering decline in viewers, is by far still their main source of income owing to cable subscriptions and advertising.\n\n\u201cWhat Disney is doing with ESPN will be the norm for years to come \u2014 a mixture of streaming and traditional distribution,\u201d said John McGuire, a professor of media and sport at Oklahoma State University.\n\n\u2013 League Pass \u2013\n\nThere is also a technical reason for the cautious approach.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of infrastructure and the infrastructure is not there right now. The ability to stream concurrently to a large number of people can only be done by a few services,\u201d Skipper, the ex-ESPN head, told CNBC in November.\n\nTechnical glitches have impacted the screening of some sports. An ESPN live stream of a 2014 football World Cup match between the USA and Germany crashed due to high demand.\n\nDisney, aware that problems occur, spent $2.6 billion in 2017 to take control of BAMTech Media, a company that has expertise in streaming sport.\n\nThese platforms not only face competition for subscribers from each other, but also from the leagues themselves.\n\nMore and more organizations have their own streaming offers, available almost anywhere in the world. The best example is the NBA League Pass which allows users to watch all games, live and on-demand.\n\nWith several broadcasters bidding for rights and with sports fans having to buy a variety of packages to watch their favorite sports, Oklahoma State professor McGuire is certain of one thing.\n\n\u201cIt will continue getting more and more expensive in the coming years,\u201d he told AFP.", "description": "New York (AFP) \u2013 Streaming services have long focused on series and movies, but as online TV competition heats up could live sports \u2014", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/66dd06_sports-stars-lebron-james-pictured-pre-season-in-shanghai-china-attraction-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
