The U.S. Forest Service had initially planned to make more modest changes to nearly 9.5 million acres there where roads are prohibited: Under the administration\u2019s \u201cpreferred alternative,\u201d that entire area would be open for development.\n\nAD\n\nCongress has designated another 5.7 million acres of the forest as wilderness, which must remain off limits to such activities under any circumstances.\n\nTongass, which lies in southeast Alaska, is home to massive old growth stands and provides habitat for a range of wildlife. Roughly 40 percent of wild salmon that swim along the West Coast spawn in the Tongass, generating a fishery that the Forest Service estimates is worth $986 million a year.\n\nAD\n\nThe agency said in a statement that the Tongass \u2014 which ranks as the single largest holding in the federal forest system \u2014 covers 80 percent of the land along the 500-mile Southeast Alaska Panhandle. \u201cIt is rich in natural resources and cultural heritage,\u201d the statement said.\n\nWhile President George W. Bush sought to reverse Clinton\u2019s roadless policy in the Tongass in 2003, a federal judge reinstated it in 2011, and the decision was upheld on appeal.\n\nAD\n\nIn a statement, Forest Service officials said the plan \u2014 which lists five other alternatives, which include greater restrictions on logging \u2014 will be subject to public comment for 60 days. Those comments \u201cwill inform the department\u201d as Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue \u201cmoves toward a final decision,\u201d an official added.\n\nAD\n\nBut Trump, who has spoken with Alaska Gov. Michael J. Dunleavy (R) multiple times on the subject, has asked Perdue to exempt the Tongass from logging limits, according to multiple federal officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.\n\nAlaska\u2019s entire congressional delegation, all of whom are Republican, have also asked Trump to expand development in the Tongass. While the Forest Service has approved at least 55 projects in roadless areas, including 36 for mining and 10 related to the power sector, lawmakers said that permitting had imposed unnecessary delays.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs Alaskans know well, the Roadless Rule hinders our ability to responsibly harvest timber, develop minerals, connect communities, or build energy projects to lower costs \u2014 including renewable energy projects like hydropower, all of which severely impedes the economy of Southeast,\u201d said Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) in a statement.\n\nAD\n\nTimber provides a small portion of southeastern Alaska\u2019s jobs \u2014 just under 1 percent, according to the regional development group, Southeast Conference, compared with seafood processing\u2019s 8 percent and tourism\u2019s 17 percent.\n\nEric Jorgensen, managing attorney in the Juneau office of the environmental law firm Earthjustice, said in a phone interview that his group would challenge the move and was confident it would prevail because previous courts had affirmed the 2001 policy.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is the agency will face a heavy burden to justify this exemption,\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s attack on the Tongass National Forest threatens an irreplaceable national treasure.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJorgensen noted that the administration could not finalize its plan until next year, and that it would \u201cbe difficult\u201d to hold a timber sale in the protected area before the end of Trump\u2019s first term because the Forest Service would have to conduct an environmental analysis of any new auction as well as revamp its existing management plan for the Tongass.\n\nScientists who have worked in the area warn that the road building that would be required to take out more timber could fragment critical habitat, and logging could remove trees that trap sediment and keep waterways cool.\n\n\u201cThey went to the easy places first. Now they\u2019re going to have to build roads to get to the next round of timber,\u201d said Forest Service emeritus scientist Gordon Reeves, who worked as a research scientist in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska for 35 years, in a recent interview. \u201cYou put the roads in, and that tends to change everything.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Move would reverse 2001 roadless rule, opening up more than half of North America\u2019s biggest temperate rainforest to development", "authors": ["Juliet Eilperin", "Reporter Covering Domestic Policy", "National Affairs"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/pkqJQ9Jen6C038Y4oZqAdjkyK_w=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IO3G7EWILII6TFQVR4NDFFROAQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
