The law prescribes a minimum ten-year prison sentence for someone who provides an abortion except in cases where the life of the mother is in jeopardy. Women seeking abortions would not be prosecuted.\n\nExecutive director of the American Civil Liberties Union Randall Marshall commented that the decision to block the law was expected. The ban on abortions would have gone into effect in November.\n\nJudge Thompson\u2019s ruling will stay in effect until the court resolves the case in full.\n\nIn a statement on Twitter, the ACLU lauded the court\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cWith this federal court ruling, it\u2019s official: None of the state abortion bans passed earlier this year are in effect,\u201d the statement read, referring to abortion restrictions put forward in Ohio, Georgia, Missouri, and other states. \u201cAbortion remains legal in all 50 states.\u201d\n\nAlabama Governor Kay Ivey signed the law on May 15 of this year.\n\n\u201cTo the bill\u2019s many supporters, this legislation stands as a powerful testament to Alabamians\u2019 deeply held belief that every life is precious & that every life is a sacred gift from God,\u201d Ivey said at the time.\n\nIvey had also cautioned that the law might be impossible to enforce due to court challenges.\n\n\u201cNo matter one\u2019s personal view on abortion, we can all recognize that, at least for the short term, this bill may similarly be unenforceable,\u201d she said.\n\nOn May 24 abortion provider Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit against the law.", "description": "A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction blocking an Alabama law that bans abortion in almost all cases.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
