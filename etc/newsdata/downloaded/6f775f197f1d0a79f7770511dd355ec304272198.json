Of equal significance, the Army seeks a vehicle \u201csoon,\u201d which can be upgraded effectively.\n\nSome are raising the question as to whether the clarity or focus of this vision could be impaired by the apparent disqualification of the Raytheon-Rheinmetall Lynx vehicle. If, according to reports, the Army disqualified the Lynx for missing the delivery deadline, then only General Dynamics Land Systems remains as the sole bidder. Some are raising the question about having just one vendor initially bidding and submitting early prototypes for the program will compromise its success. This criticism, however valid, merits further exploration given the significance of the program for Army modernization.\n\nInitially, there are several pressing or self-evident elements to this. First, competition for the program will not disappear. The Army plans a full and open production competition for 2023, so no vendors will be discouraged or limited when it comes to evolving, testing and maturing a vehicle. Secondly, the Army asked industry to invest, innovate and engage in dialogue -- something which may have been done to varying degrees. It introduces a pertinent question: should Army or industry progress be stalled or complicated in some way when there might not be full clarity regarding vendor participation may change?\n\nFurthermore, timing on the program, per Army strategy, is very significant; remember, this program was initially envisioned as an effort to deliver vehicles as far away as the early 2030s. However, the speed and danger of emerging threats inspired the Army to move up the timeframe for operational status by as much as a decade. Executing this accelerated vision of course hinges upon leveraging promising new innovations and commercial off-the-shelf available technologies -- in the near term.\n\nThe strategy, as refined by the Army, seeks to both introduce unprecedented combat capability while also bringing many \u201cavailable now\u201d and \u201cready to be produced\u201d technologies. With this in mind, many vendors such as General Dynamics and Raytheon-Rheinmetall have \"dug deep\" to leverage innovations. For instance, General Dynamics innovators, engineers and weapons developers have been spending recent years building prototype Griffin vehicles and other combat subsystems to engage in dialogue with the Army about what they would most like to see. Much of this GD strategy was aimed a soliciting and incorporating the Army\u2019s vision for the new platform. The service has conducted a clear and open competition, and, for their offering, GD developers sought to emphasize the key priorities outlined by the Army, to include 3rd-gen FLIR, Lethality, Optics, Growth Potential, Protection and Transportability.\n\nThere are many merits to an approach of this kind, not the least of which are the efforts to demo, test and refine promising near-term technologies. Secondly, a nearer term, produceable vehicle such as the offering General Dynamics and R&R have evolved makes a lot of sense for several reasons. Essentially, many of the most impactful and yet-to-exist combat vehicle technologies are already here in some respects\u2026. and, of even greater relevance, many of the anticipated future breakthroughs such as new AI-empowered algorithms, advanced sensors, autonomy, EW and cyber weapons developments and other weapons adaptations - \u201ccan\u201d be added quickly as part of an evolving modernization trajectory for vehicle that is built \u201cnow.\u201d\n\nMany of the more immediate technological breakthroughs are expected to come in the form of algorithms, software, networking and sensing - not to mention EW and cyber. This means the best and soonest upgrades may not be hardware intensive, something which enables an existing platform to be brought to paradigm-changing levels of combat capability quickly without huge amounts of \u201cbending\u201d new metal. This bears upon GDs recent experience of prototyping, testing and demonstrating state-of-the-art and emerging combat vehicle weapons technologies. Any vehicle built now, in short, could become almost entirely new in some respects with new weapons and hardened networking creating a combat-web of nodes connecting with drones, helicopters, tanks, dismounted soldiers and even ships and aircraft in multi-domain operations.", "description": "Oh, and they want it like now.", "authors": ["Kris Osborn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/sothLTsCEF8Tx2NoB7F38A--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/7b59fc7e6994a07112eded715c81c51f", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
