Maybe another three maximum. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nHe became unified heavyweight champion in November 2015 with a stunning unanimous decision win over Wladimir Klitschko in Germany.\n\nWhile the Ukrainian finished his career at the age of 41 with 64 wins from 69 fights, Fury is thinking of calling it a day in the not too distant future after 30 bouts, 29 victories and one controversial draw with Wilder last year.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what Klitschko\u2019s motivation was. I think I am coming to the tail end of my boxing career at the ripe old age of 31,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a young man\u2019s game. I\u2019ve had my time in the sun. A few more fights and I will relax on the beach somewhere.\u201d\n\nFor many boxers the desire to hold all the belts is a big motivation, but Fury has already had that privilege after beating Klitschko four years ago and in the process becoming lineal heavyweight champion of the world.\n\nTyson Fury has enjoyed his \"time in the sun\" (Isaac Brekssen/PA)\n\nHe subsequently had to relinquish all the belts and currently Wilder holds the WBC title and Andy Ruiz \u2013 who shocked Anthony Joshua in December \u2013 has the WBA, IBF and WBO titles.\n\nAsked if he wanted to take Wilder\u2019s belt in February, Fury responded: \u201cHis belt doesn\u2019t mean anything to me because alphabetical titles don\u2019t mean anything to me. I am above all that.\n\n\u201cWhen you are the lineal heavyweight champion, you are the best of your era.\n\n\u201cThere have been 44 lineal heavyweight champions and I am number 44, so whatever alphabetical titles exist out there \u2013 and there are a lot of them \u2013 I am not interested in them. I have won every one.\n\nFury drew with Deontay Wilder, also pictured (PA)\n\n\u201cEvery big organisation belt I have won before; including The Ring Magazine and everything else. The belts, I am not interested in. Whoever says Tyson Fury is not interested in winning belts, they are correct.\n\n\u201cI have tonnes of belts at home and plenty that I hang my trousers with. Belts are very useful and the most useful belt is the one I am wearing today to hold my trousers up.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need a belt to be considered the best. I am the lineal heavyweight champion of the world, 44th in history.\u201d\n\nFury simply wants to keep defending his lineal championship after five defences so far against Sefer Seferi, Francesco Pianeta, Wilder, Tom Schwarz and Otto Wallin.\n\nOtto Wallin was the most recent fighter to try, and fail, to beat Fury (Carl Markham/PA)\n\nBefore the 31-year-old Manchester fighter can get back to that, he will be in the wrestling ring on Thursday at WWE\u2019s Crown Jewel event in Saudi Arabia.\n\nFury will be fulfilling a \u201clifelong dream\u201d when he goes to war with Strowman and after he will look to remain at the top of the heavyweight division for three more fights.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe rewards for WWE are pretty good. It\u2019s a risk-reward situation, but I am a hungry lion.\n\n\u201cIt is one of those things where you either want to box or you don\u2019t. I don\u2019t think it is about hunger or whatever, it is about the drive in the individual and how much you want to do something.\n\n\u201cIt is whether you want to elevate to the next level or if you are happy where you are. With me, I want to stay at this level (in boxing) because I can\u2019t go any higher.\n\n\u201cThere is nowhere I can elevate to, but I can maintain where I am and that is what I intend to do.\u201d", "description": "Undefeated heavyweight has `no interest\u00b4 in winning back all of the heavyweight belts and expects to quit boxing after three more fights.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/20/wire-20195588-1572032951-67_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
