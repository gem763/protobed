The duplicitous gene gifted from my parents was hidden somewhere inside me. I could feel it travelling through my blood, under my skin.'\n\nShe says the gene ApoE4 is a mutation of the ApoE gene which everyone has two copies of.\n\nAround 25 per cent of people have one ApoE4, which makes them twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's as those without.\n\nGill said one of her grandparents suffered with Alzheimer's to the point where he wouldn't recognise her when she visited.\n\nGill said she is 15 times more likely to get Alzheimer's, with a 60 per cent chance she will have it by the age of 85\n\nThe journalist says she has found online communities of young people who have also discovered they have a high likelihood of developing Alzheimer's\n\nJames Pickett, head of research at The Alzheimer's Society, said: 'Anyone considering getting a genetic test should do so with their eyes open.\n\n'It's a highly personal decision, but could cause great anxiety without the correct support and understanding. For anyone concerned about dementia, the first port of call should be a GP, not a genetic test.'\n\nDementia and Alzheimer's diseases were the leading cause of death in 2017, accounting for more than one in eight of all deaths.\n\nThe 28-year-old said her father AA Gill, who died in 2016 after a battle of cancer, was an ambassador for The Alzheimer's Society after watching his own father struggle with the disease.\n\nRudd campaigning with her ex-husband, the writer and restaurant critic A. A. Gill, in 2005, who died in 2016\n\nThe journalist said: 'When I saw my gene results, I burst into tears'\n\nShe says: 'Now I have my results, I'm particularly aware of any mention of Alzheimer's, whether a character portrayed on television or a story recalled by a friend \u2014 every tale feels like a glimpse of my potential future.'\n\nThe journalist says she has found online communities of young people who have also discovered they have a high likelihood of developing Alzheimer's, with one person saying it was like a 'death sentence'.\n\nOthers say they have to force themselves to not think about it and are already worrying about forgetting things.", "description": "The journalist, 28, said she took an ancestry test which analysed her DNA and revealed she inherited an 'Alzheimer's gene' from each of her parents, Amber Rudd and critic AA Gill.", "authors": ["Jack Newman For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/16/20248754-0-image-a-26_1572192236975.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
