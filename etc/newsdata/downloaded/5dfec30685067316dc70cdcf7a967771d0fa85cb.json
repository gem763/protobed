A large crater was left in the street.\n\nThe interior ministry spokesman, Nasrat Rahimi, said some 400 foreigners had been rescued in the wake of the attack.\n\nThe Green Village was previously hit by a suicide car bomber in January. That attack also coincided with a development regarding America\u2019s role in the country, as the US envoy was visiting the capital to brief the Afghan government on his negotiations with the Taliban on ending America\u2019s longest war.\n\nHours before Monday\u2019s attack, Zalmay Khalilzad showed a draft deal to the Afghan president after declaring that they are \u201cat the threshold of an agreement\u201d following the end of the ninth round of US-Taliban talks in Qatar.\n\nThe agreement still needs President Donald Trump\u2019s approval.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Can they be trusted!!??\u201d presidential spokesman Sediq Seddiqi tweeted.\n\nThe attack comes at a time when the Taliban appears to be getting what it wants in a deal with the US \u2013 a troop withdrawal. The group wants all of the some 20,000 US and NATO troops out of Afghanistan immediately, while the US seeks a withdrawal in phases that would depend on the Taliban meeting certain conditions such as a reduction in violence.\n\nTaliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said that \u201cwe understand that peace talks are going on ... but they must also understand that we are not weak and if we enter into talks ... we enter from a strong position.\u201d\n\nThe attack was a response to raids by US and Afghan forces on civilians in other parts of the country, Mr Mujahid told AP. While he acknowledged there should be less harm to civilians, he said they shouldn\u2019t be living near such an important foreign compound.\n\nAttacks have surged in recent months, including Taliban assaults on two provincial capitals over the weekend, as the group seeks to strengthen its negotiating position not only with the US but with the Afghan government in the even more challenging intra-Afghan talks that are meant to follow a US-Taliban deal on Afghanistan\u2019s future.\n\nSome analysts have warned that some factions of the Taliban might be expressing displeasure with the US deal, though Taliban political leaders at the talks in Qatar have insisted that their tens of thousands of fighters would respect whatever agreement is reached.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "A major Taliban suicide attack on an affluent area of Kabul has killed at least 16 people and injured more than 100 others.
