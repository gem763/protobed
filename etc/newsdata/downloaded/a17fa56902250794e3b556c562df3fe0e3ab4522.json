But with home advantage on their side the Japan captain, Michael Leitch, is hoping the side can attain their goal of a top-eight finish and then go even further.\n\nThe 30-year-old flanker, who will be appearing in his third World Cup, said: \u201cIn my opinion, the only reason we would ever lose a match would be because we couldn\u2019t execute what we aimed to do. I don\u2019t imagine us losing because the opponent is stronger than us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope to build the team so we can aim for the title. If we focus on preparation, we will be able to play consistently and the results will follow.\u201d\n\nLeitch will lead a side that contains a mix of speed, power and versatility \u2013 the latter the result of both necessity and desire. As their head coach, Jamie Joseph, said: \u201cI am looking for players who under pressure can play different positions.\u201d\n\nA perceived lack of homegrown talent at lock means flankers such as Uwe Helu and Wimpie van der Walt will likely line up alongside veteran Luke Thompson, who was persuaded to come out of international retirement to make a run at a fourth World Cup.\n\n\u201cI love his experience and resilience,\u201d Joseph said of the 38-year-old Thompson, who prior to his recall in July had played only one Test since 2015, when he was called up as emergency cover for the second Test against Ireland in 2017. Joseph added: \u201cIf you look at teams [who] have been successful at World Cups they have a good balance of experience and Thommo gives us that.\u201d\n\nIn the backs, players such as Will Tupou, Rikiya Matsuda and Kotaro Matsushima are all capable of playing a number of positions with Joseph and the attack coach, Tony Brown, aware that Japan will need different gameplans depending on the opposition in the pool stages.\n\nSo what are Japan\u2019s strengths? The back row \u2013 with Joseph able to call upon Leitch, Kazuki Himeno, Amanaki Mafi and Pieter \u201cLappies\u201d Labuschagne \u2013 is a mix of athleticism and power, Kenki Fukuoka and Matsushima have pace and finishing skill out wide, while hooker Shota Horie and scrum-half Fumiaki Tanaka have a wealth of experience.\n\nDefensively, Japan looked much improved during the Pacific Nations Cup. But they will need to improve their discipline, particularly at the scrum. As Joseph said: \u201cThe players are prepared physically. It is about putting all those things into the game and executing under pressure.\u201d\n\n* Rich Freeman is a rugby writer and commentator based in Japan", "description": "Hosts Japan hope home advantage will help them break the glass ceiling to reach the knockout stages for the first time", "authors": ["Bret Harris"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70cf31ec217587b72f8235d59f0f810394315cff/0_0_500_300/master/500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e9becdf9f1265e90413f432595b55851", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
