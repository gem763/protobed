That to me is incredible,\u201d Justice Sotomayor said during an event Wednesday hosted by the Ronald Reagan Institute celebrating retired Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor.\n\nShe also said the media should be doing a better job of explaining to the public how issues impact them \u2014 not making it all about politics.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at the news, I certainly don\u2019t hear a lot of intelligent conversation explaining this issue as a nonpartisan issue, as one that is basic to our survival as a democracy,\u201d Justice Sotomayor added.\n\nLike Justice O\u2019Connor, who was the first woman appointed to the high court, Justice Sotomayor made history becoming the first Hispanic appointed to the Supreme Court in 2009.\n\nHer comments about inserting politics into the judicial process comes as Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, who was confirmed after a remarkably contentious confirmation battle last year, was in the audience at the event on Capitol Hill.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg also joined Justice Sotomayor at the event, speaking about her time on the court with Justice O\u2019Connor.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
