Let\u2019s hope she doesn\u2019t take America with her.\n\nThe speaker\u2019s decision to go all in on impeachment is fraught with danger and could have fateful consequences far beyond Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. With only about a year to go until the 2020 election, Pelosi has thrown her full weight behind the effort to undo the results of 2016.\n\nThis is a historic mistake, one that could tear America apart. Based on the evidence the House has made public, impeaching Trump is a meritless, reckless assault on democracy.\n\nAnyone who believes our country is now a polarized tinderbox ain\u2019t seen nothing yet. Trying to remove the president on the flimsy charges that he illegally pressured Ukraine for investigative help would quicken the national crack-up that\u2019s been building for years.\n\nPelosi\u2019s timing is both cynical and bizarre. A full House vote on an impeachment inquiry, which could come Thursday, probably means she is aiming to consider articles of impeachment this year.\n\nThe rush suggests an acceptance of the reality that there will be nothing in those articles that would sway 20 Senate Republicans needed for conviction and removal, so the aim is to please the radicals in her own party and be done with it as soon as possible. Thus, Pelosi is ready to throw America into chaos simply as a political favor to Democrats\u2019 wing-nuts so they won\u2019t run primaries against her leadership team and committee heads.\n\nPelosi isn\u2019t leading, she\u2019s following.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t she just step aside and let Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar run the party? They would probably start by declaring war on Israel.\n\nPelosi\u2019s pandering to the kooks mocks the gravity of the impeachment provision and makes rank partisanship her sole agenda. Instead of working with the Senate and White House on legislation that might move the nation forward, she chooses to take it backward and risks igniting a violent spasm of tribalism.\n\nIn a \u201cDear Democratic Colleague\u201d letter Monday, she couched her choice as the best way to combat the White House\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the demands for testimony and documents from six different committees. In fact, those committees already are fashioning an impeachment case, much of it in secret, while trying to avoid a formal public vote to protect their vulnerable colleagues in swing districts.\n\nForced by Trump to take the public vote or fight the authority issue in the courts, Pelosi responded by effectively accusing the president of refusing to cooperate with a lynch mob. Her solution is to give the mob a plastic badge to make it legal.\n\nHer real problem is that she doesn\u2019t have the goods to justify impeachment under any process. And she won\u2019t, no matter how many witnesses emerge from the bureaucracy to say they were unhappy with the Ukraine call or didn\u2019t agree with Trump\u2019s choices. Policy disagreements and murky arguments won\u2019t lead to a public consensus for removing an elected president.\n\nIn truth, Pelosi cornered herself in late September. That\u2019s when she unleashed the committee probes and used the I-word, saying Trump was guilty of a \u201cbetrayal of his oath\u201d and \u201cmust be held accountable.\u201d\n\nThe next day, the White House released the transcript of the Ukraine call. While it wasn\u2019t \u201cperfect,\u201d as Trump insists, the call was not even close to a \u201chigh crime and misdemeanor\u201d by any reasonable standard.\n\nsee also House releases resolution formalizing Trump impeachment inquiry The White House and Trump allies in Congress on Tuesday...\n\nStill, until Monday, Pelosi had an off-ramp. She could have let the investigations continue to see if evidence emerged that Trump had committed some other clear and compelling violations of law. If nothing emerged, she could have let the probes quietly die of boredom and inattention.\n\nNow, with a plan for public hearings and fiery cross-examination, she has zero alternative to producing and passing articles of impeachment and sending them to a Senate for trial. As it stands now, the trial will fail by a wide margin \u2014 67 votes are need for conviction \u2014 and Trump will legitimately be able to claim vindication.\n\nIf that weren\u2019t trouble enough for Dems, there is now another X factor \u2014 the Justice Department\u2019s review of the origins of the 2016 spying on the Trump campaign is now a criminal investigation. Any prosecutions against the likes of James Comey, John Brennan and James Clapper would mark a complete comeuppance for Barack Obama\u2019s administration.\n\nImagine the impact of that on the 2020 race. It would be a final nail in the candidacy of former Obama veep Joe Biden and force the eventual nominee to defend the party\u2019s dirty tricks of 2016.\n\nGood luck with that burden.\n\nAs for Pelosi, she is betting the country in a grubby bid to hold on to power. History will not be kind to her.\n\nBlas fails homeless children\n\nFrom Post reporter Selim Algar comes more evidence of the decline of New York and the failure of Mayor de Blasio. Algar writes, \u201cThe number of homeless city schoolkids hovered near staggering record highs in the last academic year, topping 100,000 for the fourth consecutive period, according to a new report.\n\n\u201cCiting data from the state Education Department, Advocates for Children of New York found that 114,085 public and charter students \u2014 or 1 in 10 \u2014 identified as homeless. Of those, 34,000 resided in city shelters and 73,750 were living in temporary housing with relatives, friends or other acquaintances.\u201d\n\nThe head of the agency put it this way: \u201cThe number of students who experienced homelessness last year \u2014 85 percent of whom are black or Hispanic \u2014 could fill the Barclays Center six times.\u201d\n\nAnd de Blasio wanted to be president. Imagine the damage he would do to America.\n\nLeft vs left? All right!\n\nNew York Dems can\u2019t handle success. Less than a year after taking full control of Albany, their simmering civil war is bursting into the open.\n\nThe Working Families Party issued a full-frontal attack on Gov. Cuomo Tuesday, accusing him of wanting to help Republicans at its expense. Now that\u2019s a low blow!\n\nIt seems Cuomo\u2019s handpicked head of the state Democratic Party wants to make it harder for smaller parties to keep their ballot lines. Instead of needing at least 50,000 votes, the number would rise to 250,000.\n\n\u201cWe know Andrew Cuomo\u2019s politics, we knew a sneak attack like this was coming,\u201d the WFP said in a fund-raising pitch. It said Cuomo \u201cprefers divided government, where he can bottle up progressive legislation and be the kingmaker in every deal.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m guessing Cuomo won\u2019t stay silent. This could be fun.\n\nBoulder action!\n\nAfter a one-ton boulder called \u201cWizard Rock\u201d was stolen from an Arizona national forest, a federal official told Fox News that \u201cour hope is that it will be returned to us, and these recent recurring events will become an educational opportunity.\u201d\n\nSuggestion: Hunting down the perps and locking them up would be a far better education.", "description": "The speaker\u2019s decision to go all in on impeachment is fraught with danger and could have fateful consequences far beyond Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.", "authors": ["Michael Goodwin", "October"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/nancy-pelosi-2.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
