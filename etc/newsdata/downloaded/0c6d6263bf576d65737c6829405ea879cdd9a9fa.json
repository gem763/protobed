What it meant in practice was demonstrated in March 2014, when the Russian troops took over the Ukrainian Crimea, which Putin declared a historical heritage site common to the Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians and the place where his namesake, Prince Vladimir (Ukr. Volodymyr) of Kyiv, had been baptized. Russia\u2019s annexation of the Crimea made this allegedly common site an exclusively Russian possession.\n\nThe view of Ukrainians as constituents of the Russian nation goes back to the founding myth of modern Russia as a nation conceived and born in Kyiv (Kiev) in the tenth and eleventh centuries during the times of St. Vladimir. It was first widely disseminated in Russia by the Synopsis of 1674, the first printed \u201ctextbook\u201d of Russian history, compiled by Kyivan monks seeking the protection of the Muscovite tsars.", "description": "To justify his meddling in Ukraine, Vladimir Putin has claimed Ukrainians as Russian people.
