I love how Indian women take care of themselves. Their eyes, in particular, so beautiful. I have really never seen such beautiful eyebrows. I am an Italian woman and I love thick, beautiful eyebrows. After I wrote \u201cBorn This Way\u201d and I started giving interviews, particularly interviews with Indian reporters, I\u2019d speak about rebirth and they\u2019d say that rebirth is a huge part of the Indian culture. So, I began to reflect on how reincarnation was relevant for my own record and how it was about being reborn over and over again in your own lifetime in a way to kill off the evil obstacles that you\u2019ve been through and move to a place of happiness and liberation,\u201d she had told TOI in an interview earlier.", "description": "The Poker Face singer, who recently made headlines for falling off the stage along with a fan during her concert in Las Vegas, recently broke the internet with her tweet.
