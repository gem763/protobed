But Unbelievable concentrates its spotlight entirely on the subject, and its eight episodes can be tough to watch: Marie, played by Kaitlyn Dever (Booksmart), is inscrutable, even maddening, as she struggles to keep the details of her rape straight. The episodes, which toggle between two timelines and multiple cases, are loaded with exposition, law-enforcement terminology, and uncomfortable flashbacks. The most pulse-pounding sequence in the early episodes isn\u2019t the one in which a detective draws her gun to corner a suspect; it\u2019s the one in which she and another Colorado detective call every police department in the state after hours, trying to track down similar cases while at an empty office, at dinner with their families, or out walking the dog, off the clock but desperate to find their next lead.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t read a lot of scripts that talk about [rape] the way we do,\u201d Dever told me, shaking her head, when we spoke in late August. \u201cNot often.\u201d\n\nEven Miller and Armstrong, long before Unbelievable was made, saw the difficulty in potentially adapting a story of rape for the screen, attributing the challenge to the delicate nature of such cases. \u201cMany detectives avoided sex crimes if they could,\u201d they wrote in A False Report. \u201cThey weren\u2019t as high profile as homicides; nobody came looking to do a movie about a rape case. Where homicides were black and white, rape was filled with grays. And rape victims were alive and hurting. Their pain was always in your face\u2014and you could never, ever look away.\u201d\n\nFor the writer and showrunner Susannah Grant (Erin Brockovich), though, that\u2019s exactly why Unbelievable had to be made: The series could take certain truths about rape cases\u2014that there is no \u201cperfect\u201d victim, no \u201cperfect\u201d case, no \u201cperfect\u201d investigation\u2014and present them so that viewers couldn\u2019t look away. \u201cThere was one thing I thought was really important to show,\u201d she told me. \u201c[And that] was, people don\u2019t just have one reaction to a trauma.\u201d\n\nGrant and her fellow producers, including the anchor Katie Couric and Marie herself (credited only as \u201cMarie\u201d), sought a filmmaker who understood how to capture \u201cemotional complexity.\u201d They found her in the director Lisa Cholodenko (The Kids Are Alright), who set the series\u2019 candid tone by overseeing its first three episodes. \u201cI found it to be a compelling yarn, and not much in a true-crime kind of way, but more as a human story about people\u2019s fallibility and projections and missed perceptions,\u201d Cholodenko explained to me over the phone. \u201cOn so many levels, it was just a really compelling story about the human condition.\u201d", "description": "The new series aims to make viewers uncomfortable\u2014but its creators say that\u2019s the key to adapting a real-life rape case for the screen.", "authors": ["Shirley Li"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/Unbelievable/facebook.jpg?1568390921", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
