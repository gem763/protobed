Ostrager is considerably less splashy.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James alleges that Exxon defrauded investors in violation of the state\u2019s Martin Act by keeping two sets of numbers to assess the impact of climate regulations, while Exxon insists there was nothing remarkable about the separate cost metrics.\n\n\u201cThe New York Attorney General\u2019s case is misleading and deliberately misrepresents a process we use to ensure company investments take into account the impact of current and potential climate-related regulations,\u201d said Exxon spokesman Scott J. Silvestri in a statement.\n\nThe trial could see an appearance on the stand by former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson, who served as President Trump\u2019s first secretary of state. Real money is at stake: The state estimated the damages to shareholders at between $476 million and $1.6 billion.\n\n\u201cWe are not telling Exxon how to run its business, it was and always is free to change its business practices. But it has to be honest with investors,\u201d said Kevin Wallace, acting chief of the Investor Protection Bureau, in Tuesday\u2019s opening argument, as reported by the New York Post.\n\nAn accounting dispute isn\u2019t quite what was promised when then-Attorney General Eric Schneiderman \u2014 with former Vice President Al Gore riding shotgun \u2014 announced at a March 2016 press conference that a coalition of liberal attorneys general would pursue fossil-fuel companies and their supporters for downplaying climate-change risks.\n\nSince then, however, only Massachusetts has joined New York in conducting a full-fledged investigation, while most of the 17 attorneys general involved in AGs United for Clean Power have done nothing, or at least nothing publicly.\n\n\u201c#Exxonmobil did nothing wrong\u2026.The allegations in the complaint are bizarre and twisted.\u201d - Ted Wells, counsel for ExxonMobil\n\n\n\nEditorial boards agree: https://t.co/qAaEMW4vgH \u2014 Energy In Depth (@EnergyInDepth) October 22, 2019\n\nThe New York probe appeared to run aground with the May 2018 resignation of Mr. Schneiderman amid physical-abuse allegations, but his replacement, Barbara Underwood, filed the lawsuit in October under pressure from the court either to drop the probe or take action.\n\nWith the case now in court, Democrats, climate-change groups, friendly media outlets, and the Rockefeller Family Fund have jumped in to show support.\n\nHouse Democrats plan to hold a hearing Wednesday on the oil industry\u2019s \u201cefforts to suppress the truth about climate change.\u201d Protesters from 350.org gathered outside the courtroom Tuesday with a \u201cMake Them Pay\u201d banner, chanting \u201cExxon knew!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in this climate mess because we heat our homes or drive cars, which is what fossil fuel companies want us to think,\u201d said Rockefeller CEO Lew Wasserman in a New York Times op-ed. \u201cWe\u2019re victims of a small group of gargantuan companies that ignored their own science on global warming.\u201d\n\nNice banner.\n\n\n\nOf the 8 inches of global sea level rise since 1870, how much was allegedly caused by Exxon, and how much was caused by termite greenhouse gas emissions?\n\n\n\nPlease show your math. https://t.co/CcSRXiFwa1 \u2014 Tom Nelson (@tan123) October 22, 2019\n\nCritics in the industry describe the case as an \u201corchestrated campaign\u201d backed by Rockefeller and other leftist foundations to bring down Exxon by weaponizing sympathetic state prosecutors, using the blueprint provided by the tobacco litigation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been well established that the New York Attorney General\u2019s investigation and resulting civil lawsuit were politically motivated and resulted from a coordinated effort by anti-fossil fuel groups and contingency-fee lawyers involved in other lawsuits against industry,\u201d Mr. Silvestri said.\n\nEnergy in Depth\u2019s Spencer Walrath noted that Mr. Schneiderman emphasized that the case is \u201cnot what the company knew about climate change and when it knew it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo the dismay of the many activist groups who been trying to get a court of law to agree with their manufactured #ExxonKnew narrative since the beginning, neither ExxonMobil\u2019s climate research nor its alleged role in hiding climate science from the public will be on trial,\u201d said Mr. Walrath.\n\nTom Stebbins, executive director of the Lawsuit Reform Alliance of New York, called the case \u201can abuse of the Martin Act,\u201d New York\u2019s tough anti-financial fraud statute.\n\n\u201cThe idea that the attorney general is bringing this on behalf of ExxonMobil investors is laughable,\u201d Mr. Stebbins said. \u201cThat is not the intent of this lawsuit at all. The intent of this lawsuit is to make a political statement about climate change.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
