Secret recordings made by a whistleblower suggest a different agenda", "language": "en", "text": "Bishop Richard Malone, the embattled spiritual leader of the Diocese of Buffalo, is back on the defensive after a second whistleblower came forward on Wednesday, armed with hours of secret recordings that show the bishop navigating what he called \u201ca true crisis situation\u201d for his administration.\n\nThose recordings, made by Malone\u2019s then-secretary and diocesan vice chancellor Fr. Ryszard Biernat and obtained by ABC News, suggest that Malone sought to conceal from public view allegations against a priest he considered \u201csick,\u201d even as he responded to widespread criticism of his handling of sexual misconduct allegations against clergy in the diocese with promises of greater transparency.\n\nBishop Malone's handling of allegations of sexual abuse by clergy was detailed in a special edition of Nightline in July.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Charlie Specht, an investigative reporter for ABC\u2019s Buffalo affiliate WKBW, Biernat said his decision to first record and then betray Malone was driven by a sense of loyalty \u2013 to the people of Buffalo, if not its bishop.\n\n\u201cI am here to serve the people of Western New York the way I can,\u201d said Biernat, who agreed to take a leave of absence from the diocese in August and has until recently lived in the bishop\u2019s official residence. \u201cI feel I have a responsibility to come forward and ask Bishop Malone to please resign. For the love of God and for the sake of your people here, please resign.\u201d\n\nAfter the publication of this report, Rep. Brian Higgins, a Democrat from New York whose district includes Buffalo, reiterated his earlier calls for Bishop Malone\u2019s resignation.\n\n\u201cWestern New York Catholics have been hurt by decades of lies and coverups,\u201d Higgins said in a statement provided to ABC News. \u201cBishop Malone and his public relations team have said again and again that the problems pre-date Bishop Malone\u2019s tenure. These recordings are conclusive evidence that the coverup continues to this day. \u2026 Bishop Malone is clearly not the right person to lead this Diocese forward.\u201d\n\nOn the recordings, which span from March to August, Malone and his advisers can be heard discussing allegations against Fr. Jeffrey Nowak, who until recently served as pastor of Our Lady Help of Christians in the Buffalo suburb of Cheektowaga. Nowak was placed on administrative leave by Bishop Malone in August pending the completion of an investigation of complaints received by the Diocese of Buffalo earlier this year.\n\nIn response to questions from ABC News, the Diocese of Buffalo reiterated that Bishop Malone has no plans to resign and issued a statement defending its handling of the allegations against Nowak.\n\n\u201cThe diocese had never received \u2013 and still has not received \u2013 any allegation that Fr. Nowak ever engaged in sexual contact with anyone, child or adult,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cWhile the diocese did receive allegations of questionable behavior \u2013 behavior which was concerning enough to Bishop Malone that he felt Fr. Nowak needed a professional assessment \u2013 the diocese was and is aware of no behavior that threatened harm to the public.\u201d\n\nABC News\n\nIn a previous interview with ABC News, Malone largely defended his leadership amid the crisis but offered one major mea culpa, telling correspondent David Wright that he had made \u201cmistakes\u201d in his handling of allegations of sexual misconduct against clergy made by adults.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to an accusation of an adult being abused, or some kind of misconduct, or harassment, we've tried to handle those things in a quieter way, bring the priest in, send him for assessment, discipline him, sometimes with the hope that he could be restored to some partial ministry,\u201d Malone told ABC News. \u201cBut I see it's the wrong way to do it. And we have not done that since then.\u201d\n\nBut in Malone\u2019s handling of allegations made against Nowak, which he received prior to his interview with ABC News, Malone appears to have reverted to that same playbook.\n\nIn January, a then-seminarian at Buffalo\u2019s Christ the King Seminary named Matthew Bojanowski wrote a letter to Bishop Malone alleging that Nowak, Bojanowski\u2019s former confessor, had \u201cused information obtained from within the seal of confessional to my detriment\u201d and \u201cwas so bold as to make unwelcomed [sic] advances on me,\u201d including sending a message in which Nowak referred to Bojanowski\u2019s potential as \u201cclerical eye candy.\u201d\n\nAfter Bojanowski rebuffed those advances, he wrote, Nowak retaliated against him, allegedly searching through personal items in Bojanowski\u2019s apartment and circulating a snapshot of a letter between Bojanowski and Biernat, who are close friends, in an apparent attempt to suggest a sexual relationship between them, which both Bojanowski and Biernat deny. When reached by ABC News, Nowak declined to comment.\n\nBut even as the Diocese of Buffalo opened an inquiry into the allegations, Bishop Malone allowed Nowak to remain in ministry, prompting Biernat to start recording.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw how they were dealing with another seminarian coming forward, I thought, 'I need to do something,\u2019\u201d Biernat told WKBW. \u201cSo I started recording those meetings because they say one thing but they do nothing.\u201d\n\nWKBW\n\nIn a pair of secretly recorded meetings with his advisers in March, Malone called the allegations a \u201cserious matter,\u201d one that raised \u201cfrightening concerns\u201d about Nowak\u2019s alleged aptitude for manipulation.\n\n\u201cThe simple version here is we've got victims and we have a perpetrator, and the perpetrator is Jeff Nowak, and he's done things that are clearly wrong,\u201d Malone said in March. \u201cAnd I think he's a sick puppy.\u201d\n\nBy March, the recordings show, Malone had confronted Nowak with the allegations and decided to send him away for \u201cassessment\u201d and possibly treatment at St. Luke Institute in Maryland, which describes itself as \u201can independent, international Catholic education and treatment center dedicated to healthy life and ministry for priests, deacons, and religious\u201d that boasts that \u201c75 percent of [their] residential clients return to ministry.\u201d\n\nBut despite Malone\u2019s acknowledgment that Nowak had \u201cserious issues,\u201d Nowak remained in ministry in Cheektowaga without any notification to parishioners that he was under investigation. It wasn\u2019t until May, after WKBW published documents showing that Nowak was under scrutiny for multiple allegations of sexual harassment, that the Diocese of Buffalo publicly acknowledged that a \u201cpreliminary inquiry\u201d into Nowak\u2019s conduct had been opened.\n\nThe situation intensified in August, when a local media outlet questioned the Diocese of Buffalo about the letter between Bojanowski and Biernat. In Biernat\u2019s final recording, a fearful Malone can be heard making a desperate appeal to Biernat, encouraging him to discuss the letter in a television interview with a reporter but urging him \u2014 over and over again \u2014 to do so without mentioning its connections to Nowak\u2019s alleged misconduct.\n\nIn discussing the potential harm Nowak could cause the church, Malone called Nowak \u201cdangerous,\u201d claimed that \u201cJeff\u2019s out to get us all\u201d and asked Biernat if he would be able to \u201cstay away from the Jeff thing with the media,\u201d referring to the entire sordid tale as \u201ca can of worms,\u201d an \u201catom bomb,\u201d and \u201ca disaster\u201d that had sparked a full-blown existential crisis inside the chancery.\n\n\u201cEveryone in the office is convinced this could be the end for me as bishop,\u201d Malone told Biernat. \u201cIt could force me to resign if in fact they make a story.\u201d\n\nABC News\n\nMalone sought to assure Biernat that whatever leniency had been afforded Nowak would not continue.\n\n\u201cJeff has agreed by the way to go to Southdown, just so you know,\u201d Malone said, an apparent reference to Southdown Institute in Toronto, another church-allied treatment center that offers psychological services to clergy members. \u201cCause I told him it's that or leave of absence. So that's settled. Just so you know. \u2026 I wasn't gonna tolerate it any longer.\u201d\n\nAnd Malone warned Biernat that full public disclosure would result in no small amount of collateral damage.\n\n\u201cIt's not gonna be any good,\u201d Malone said, \u201cfor you, for Matthew, for the church or for me.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Nowak remained in ministry until August, several months after the Diocese of Buffalo received its first complaints about him. According to the diocese, Bishop Malone placed Nowak on administrative leave after he \u201ctwice refused to undergo the behavioral assessment that Bishop Malone had directed him to pursue.\u201d The diocese asserted, in its statement, that they were slow to discipline Nowak because they feared the disclosure of the letter.\n\n\u201cWhile much of the delay can be attributed to the complexity of the allegations and the unwillingness of some involved to cooperate fully,\u201d the statement reads, \u201cthe truth is that Bishop Malone was also hoping to prevent the public scandal that could well arise from publication of the letter written by Fr. Ryszard.\u201d\n\nBut Barry Covert, a Buffalo-based attorney who represents both Biernat and Bojanowski, called that explanation into question.\n\n\u201cThe diocese was told that an active priest was stalking, retaliating against, taking various immoral measures against a seminarian,\u201d Covert told ABC News. \u201cOnce again, they did nothing to protect parishioners from someone who Bishop Malone clearly felt was an abusive priest.\u201d\n\nFor Biernat, the future is unclear. He told WKBW that he is hoping for change. He hopes Malone will step down. He hopes the Vatican will intervene. He hopes the FBI will investigate.\n\nIn the meantime, Biernat said, one major change has already been made: \u201cI can't be quiet anymore,\" he said.\n\nABC News\u2019 Halley Freger contributed to this report.", "description": "Bishop Richard Malone, the embattled spiritual leader of the Diocese of Buffalo, is back on the defensive after a second whistleblower came forward on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/bishop-richard-malone-abc-jef-190725_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
