USA TODAY\n\nThe knock against one of them was that he wasn't tall enough and no one knew for sure just how much he really was committed to football.\n\nThe rub against the other was that he seemed to get injured quite a bit and there were concerns how he'd fit in a diverse NFL locker room because of some questionable decisions he made as a teenager on social media.\n\nHalfway through their rookie seasons, Kyler Murray has gone through his share of growing pains with the Cardinals, Nick Bosa has overcome hamstring and ankle pains with the 49ers, and now the stage is set for the No. 1 and No. 2 picks from the draft to face each other for the first time.\n\nIn what could be a dynamic and dramatic matchup to watch for years to come, it all starts Thursday night when Murray and the Cardinals (3-4-1) meet Bosa and the undefeated 49ers (7-0) at State Farm Stadium.\n\nNFL MIDSEASON WINNERS, LOSERS: Who made most of first eight weeks?\n\nMORE: Back in the NFL, Steelers QB Paxton Lynch hopes to revive career\n\nThe Cardinals could have passed on Murray, held onto Josh Rosen, the 10th overall pick just a year ago, and bolstered their defense by selecting Bosa. They knew the defensive end out of Ohio State was the real deal, even though he missed much of the offseason battling through minor injuries after sitting out most of his junior season because of a major core muscle issue that required surgery.\n\nBosa has been a beast, registering seven sacks, 21 quarterback pressures, 13 quarterback hits, 12 tackles for loss, plus a forced fumble, a fumble recovery and an interception he returned 46 yards during Sunday\u2019s 51-13 rout of the Panthers.\n\nWith three sacks in that game, Bosa became just the third rookie since sacks became an official stat in 1982 to record three and have an interception in the same game.\n\nHis efforts earned him his second NFC Defensive Player of the Week honors and it's catapulted Bosa as the midseason favorite to win Defensive Rookie of the Year.\n\n\"He's everything you could ask for. He's probably one of the best picks in 10 years with just how's played and he\u2019s played like this since Day 1,\" 49ers cornerback Richard Sherman told reporters this week. \"He deserves Player of the Week or Rookie of the Week or Rookie of the Year, everything.\n\n\"\u2026 Right now, he should be in line for Defensive MVP.\"\n\nA rookie hasn\u2019t won Defensive Player of the Year since legendary Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor did it in 1981. But guess who Bosa is getting compared with just seven games into his NFL career?\n\n\"He's a tremendous football player, high effort and high motor,\" Cardinals coach Kliff Kingsbury said. \"Great personality and you can see those guys are excited for him when he makes plays. He's having a heck of a year.\"\n\nHe could have been having it with the Cardinals, who scouted and courted Bosa closely in the weeks and months leading up to last April\u2019s draft. Once Murray officially measured in at 5-foot-10 and 1/8th at the combine and he formally ditched his plans at pursuing a career in Major League Baseball, he became Arizona\u2019s clear-cut No. 1 choice with the first overall pick. But Bosa was an extremely close second.\n\n\"I loved him,\" Kingsbury said. \"We got two dinners with him and he's one of those guys you want on your team, you want in your locker room. He plays his tail off. He's as relentless as they come and a real guy's guy. \u2026 We had him graded very highly and San Francisco made a great pick.\"\n\nNot that the Cardinals aren't thrilled to have Murray, of course.\n\nThe reigning Heisman trophy winner from Oklahoma already has set a franchise rookie record for most 300-yard games (3), became the first player in NFL history with 20 or more completions in each of his first six career games and he\u2019s attempted 148 consecutive passes without an interception.\n\nWith 35 more yards rushing, he will break the single-season franchise record by a rookie quarterback currently held by Bud Schwenk (313 in 1942) and with two touchdown passes against the 49ers, he will have his fourth multiple-touchdown game, which would tie Jake Plummer (1997) and M.C. Reynolds (1958) for the most such performances by a rookie in club history.\n\nAs dynamic has Bosa has been in San Francisco, Murray has been just as electric in the desert.\n\n\"Of course, we did. Of course, we did. But I love Kyler,\" Cardinals defensive coordinator Vance Joseph said when asked if he imagined how good Bosa would have looked in an Arizona uniform next to edge rusher Chandler Jones. \"Obviously, having a franchise quarterback is so key for building your franchise so I think picking Kyler was a no-brainer in my opinion.\n\n\"Obviously, Bosa is a great player and he\u2019s having a great year, but I mean Kyler is going to be a special, special player and you have to have one to win in this league.\"\n\nMurray is on pace to throw for 4,000 yards and possibly challenge Andrew Luck\u2019s NFL single season rookie record of 4,374, set in 2012. Luck's now out of the league after deciding to retire this year upon absorbing so many hits and going through tireless rehabs.\n\nThat's something Murray might have to keep in mind every single time he has to go up against Bosa, whom he'll run into at least twice a year from here on out.\n\n\"He's a freak,\" Murray said. \"He's a good player, for sure. I'll have to keep my head on a swivel on Thursday.\"\n\nMurray or Bosa? Bosa or Murray? According to 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan, \"I think it's working out for both teams.\"\n\nShanahan said Murray has been \"as good as advertised\" and that the rookie \"still looks just as poised as he did in college.\"\n\nAs much as Murray can hurt a defense with his legs and quickness, Shanahan points out that Murray is just as dangerous with his arm, saying, \"He's an extremely pure thrower who's got the arm talent to make any throw.\"\n\nAs for the matchup between Murray and Bosa, Shanahan can't wait to watch it just like the rest of the football world.\n\n\"Hopefully, we win that matchup,\" he said. \"I know it's not basketball, they're not going to play one-on-one, so hopefully our D-line can do well versus their O-line. Hopefully, our guys cover long enough to keep Murray in the pocket and don't let him buy a lot of time like he\u2019s been doing all year. It's going to be a huge challenge because he's as good at that as anyone I\u2019ve seen.\"", "description": "Halfway through their rookie seasons, Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray and 49ers end Nick Bosa still seem at the top of their class.", "authors": ["Bob Mcmanaman", "Published P.M.
