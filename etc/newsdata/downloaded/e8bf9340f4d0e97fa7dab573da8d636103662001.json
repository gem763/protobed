PAUL, Minn. (AP) - Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison says the state is not among those that have reached a tentative settlement with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma over the opioids epidemic.\n\nThe tentative deal between Purdue, thousands of local governments and more than 20 states could be worth up to $12 billion over time. Purdue has been criticized for overselling the benefits of its powerful prescription opioid painkillers and understating the risks.\n\nEllison says he feels there\u2019s uncertainty about the details of the agreement, including the amount of payments, the time period over which the payments would be made and terms for ownership and operation of Purdue and other holdings.\n\nOne of the next steps for Pharma is a bankruptcy filing, which would likely end lawsuits filed against the company. Parities that don\u2019t agreed to settle could raise objections in bankruptcy court.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison says the state is not among those that have reached a tentative settlement with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma over the opioids epidemic.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
