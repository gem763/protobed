Not yet. The horror of it was the knowledge that their minds were not yet perfect. It would be awful to look at it and see something. No, they could not look at it. They must not.\n\nSo they breezed past the reporters asking whether they had read it. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said he had been too busy running around. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said he was left with \u201cmore questions than answers.\"\n\nBen Sasse (R-Neb.) said they should not begin circling the wagons yet, and a horrible pain erupted on his right temple.\n\nHe joined the rush of senators to Lindsey Graham\u2019s (R-S.C.) office, where they clasped their hands and begged, humbly, to be allowed to really see that there was nothing there.\n\n\u201cI want to see a nothingburger,\u201d Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said sorrowfully. \u201cI am trying to see a nothingburger. But I cannot help but think that I am a little bit troubled by that transcript. It seems like, well, a somethingburger.\"\n\nGraham sighed a sigh of infinite patience.\n\n\u201cYou are worth taking time,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why the party is taking time over you. But you are laboring under some expensive delusions that I wish to root out. You still believe it is possible to be troubled by any action the president might take.\"\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Romney said, looking a little puzzled.\n\n\u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t think that,\u201d Sasse started.\n\n\u201cWould you like to be quite happy and content to support the president in all things?\"\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Romney said, \u201cif I could do so in good conscience.\u201d\n\nGraham emitted another heavy sigh. \u201cHave you considered that the problem after all might not lie with the president, but with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI had not considered that,\" Romney said, a little uneasily. \u201cPlease, I look at the transcript of the president\u2019s call to the president of Ukraine, and I am, quite frankly, disappointed and put off. It looks like the kind of thing you would not want your president to be doing. I want to see something different. If you would tell me how to see that, it would be a great weight off my mind. I want to see what you see.\"\n\nGraham looked on, unruffled. \u201cThat is good,\" he said. \u201cTo want that. That is the first step. For all of you. You wish to be like me, and I see no crimes here. There is nothing here to see. Nothing to fear or be uneasy about \u2014 except that you have not controlled your mind. Certainly no reason to leap to something as grave as impeachment.\"\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you impeach President Clinton?\" Sasse inquired.\n\n\u201cPresident Clinton never was elected, because of the emails.\u201d\n\nRomney blinked repeatedly.\n\n\u201cYou are thinking of the past,\u201d Graham said. \u201cDo you think the past exists, Senator Romney?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\nGraham sighed. \u201cThink how much happier you would be if you entertained the possibility that, actually, it did not. Think how happy goldfish are. Would you like to be as happy as a goldfish?\" He stared at the two of them, not blinking. \u201cI am happy.\u201d\n\nGraham gestured to Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), who was gazing happily at the transcript with an expression of calm. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing there,\" Perdue murmured, confidently. Graham pointed to Mike Pence, who was smiling vaguely at nothing in particular.\n\n\u201cWould you like to see what Vice President Pence sees when he looks at the president?\u201d Graham asked. \u201cBelieve me, it is very beautiful, and nothing at all like what you think you see. Think how happy you would be if President Trump were entirely different, senators.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d Sasse started.\n\n\u201cDo you think the vice president goes around thinking your Donald Trump is in the White House? Would he look so happy and so eternally unruffled if he thought that? No, of course not. He sees what is truly there: a good, great, brave man who is governing this country better than it has ever been governed.\u201d\n\nRomney sighed. \u201cI wish to see this. If only it were there.\"\n\n\u201cIf it were there!\u201d Graham\u2019s laugh echoed. \u201cDid you hear the director of national intelligence testify? These things only need to bother us if we let them. What is simpler: to alter the president\u2019s behavior, or to discipline your mind, so that you are never bothered by anything that takes place? Please; I think you already know the answer.\"\n\n\u201cWhat would Senator John McCain have done?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d Graham asked, blinking amiably. \u201cYou must try harder. There is nothing to see here, if you would only let yourself see nothing. It is not so hard when you put your mind to it. Now sit. It will be painful, but then it will be over, and you will be much happier. You will be able to look at the complaint, and really see nothing. Wouldn\u2019t you like to see nothing?\"\n\nRead more from Alexandra Petri:\n\nTrump\u2019s getting impeached? I defy you to convince anyone at this cursed truck stop.\n\nBut was it quid pro quo?
