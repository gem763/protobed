Rather than try to tie the game - or potentially even go ahead by attempting a two-point conversion - Narduzzi sent Alex Kessman on for a 19-yard field goal kick to get Pitt within four. The ball smacked off the left upright.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at it, we did what we wanted to do,\u201d Narduzzi said. \u201cWe wanted to get three there. We wanted to go out and play defense again.\u201d\n\nThough Pitt (1-2) did get the ball back with under 2 minutes to go and drove to the Penn State 26, Kenny Pickett\u2019s heave to the end zone as time expired fell to the ground.\n\nNarduzzi went out of his way to praise the play of Pickett - who threw for a career-high 372 yards - and a defense that kept the Nittany Lions in check for large portions of the afternoon. Asked why not gamble and go for it considering his confidence in both units and the fact his team hadn\u2019t scored a touchdown in the second half in each of its last five games coming in, Narduzzi bristled ever so slightly.\n\n\u201cI explained why not, so I\u2019ll explain again, that\u2019s why not,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we did what we did, and I feel good about it. Again, you can talk about what we did in Week 1 and Week 2. This is Week 3 and we\u2019re moving the football. Thanks for the question.\u201d\n\nNarduzzi did apologize to \u201cPanther Nation\u201d for the loss, adding \u201cthere\u2019s nobody that feels worse about that than the guys in this room.\u201d\n\nGuys who must now find a way to emotionally rebound on Saturday against No. 15 UCF (3-0). The Golden Knights drilled the Panthers 45-14 in Orlando last year, but Pitt appears to be significantly better on defense than it was a year ago. The Panthers held Penn State - which came in averaging 62.5 points through two weeks - to a pair of touchdowns and, except for a couple of explosive plays, never let the Nittany Lions get comfortable.\n\nIt was a positive step forward for the defending ACC Coastal Division champions everywhere but on the scoreboard.\n\n\u201cSometimes if you just look at the wins and losses, you look at nothing else, you kind of lose track of really where you are and what you\u2019ve done,\u201d Narduzzi said. \u201cBut I think I did, at least I told our kids, I really think we made improvements from Week 2 to Week 3. As young as we are, that\u2019s really what we\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Pittsburgh coach Pat Narduzzi knows his decision to attempt a field goal instead of going for it on fourth down at the goal line late in a 17-10 loss to Penn State on Saturday will be talked about for years with the rivalry taking an indefinite break.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Will Graves"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/14/pittsburgh_penn_st_football_02152_c0-125-3000-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?f52fad753beb582a85b1710fc9f6c2ec1ddbd99f", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
