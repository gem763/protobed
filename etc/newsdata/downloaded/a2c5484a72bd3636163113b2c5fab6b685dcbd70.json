It is no wonder that for those who share in the stereotypical millennial traits that when faced with switching to party mode their anxiety takes over and they bail.\n\nPerhaps they believe it may be better to bail than go through with the plans. They run away from attending where they could learn and grow from the experience.\n\nWilliam Hanson (pictured) takes a look at why people bail and - if it must be done- how to do it properly\n\nOther reasons could be they are worried they will miss out on another event if they are already committed (well, such is life) or that their own self-centred life is so important it must come first.\n\nDo we blame Facebook?\n\nThis culture of dropping out may have started with Facebook and its weird \u2018maybe attending\u2019 option the platform invented when it launched its events function.\n\nYou are either going or you are not. There is no maybe about it.\n\nOne champion bailer once admitted to me that they selected \u2018maybe attending\u2019 as they felt this was a nicer option to click - they had no intention to go but didn\u2019t want to hurt the host\u2019s feelings.\n\nOr they were simply waiting for the next best thing and were keeping their options open.\n\nThe fear of something is often worse than something itself will be. It is a shame more people can\u2019t overcome their social anxiety in this regard.\n\nAs with anything, the more practice and exposure the easier it becomes.\n\nHow to bail\n\nIf you must cancel, make sure you aren\u2019t a serial offender. Don\u2019t cry wolf too often.\n\nThe fear of something is often worse than something itself will be\n\nWhen you come to communicate the bad news state the reason but keep it concise. Wordy explanations, backstories and repetition are usually hallmarks of a lie.\n\nIf you think the bailed-on party will have lost out financially then offer to reimburse them. Even if this is politely rejected, offer once again.\n\nAnd if you are going to pull out try to cancel with as much notice as reasonably possible.\n\nLive the lie\n\nIf you have bailed then make sure you aren\u2019t caught out. Social media, as with most things, is where bailers go wrong.\n\nPost nothing on your social media channels for at least 36 hours - and definitely not a photo or story of you out and about elsewhere. It\u2019s amazing how many stories you hear of bailers not quite thinking their self-centred duplicity through.\n\nWhat happens if you bail too much?\n\nThe worry is that it will become too much of a norm.\n\nPeople will get too immune to the consequences and emotional effects on friends, family and colleagues bailing.\n\nIf you do choose to bail then you must ensure you do not post anything on social media for at least 36 hours (stock image)\n\nIf bailing is allowed in the workplace then I worry for people\u2019s careers.\n\nPeople do business with people - it doesn\u2019t matter how good the product is - if the person selling it isn\u2019t nice and respectful of others, it\u2019s less likely the business will be as commercially successful.\n\nSocially, if you are known to be unreliable then you will stop getting invited.
