(AP) - Atlantic City will get a new mayor Friday in the wake of yet another scandal in the seaside gambling resort with a history of political corruption that inspired an award-winning TV series on HBO.\n\nCity Council President Marty Small, a Democrat, will be sworn in as mayor at noon.\n\nIt comes a day after fellow Democrat Frank Gilliam Jr. pleaded guilty to stealing $87,000 from a youth basketball club he founded, and resigned.\n\nGilliam pleaded guilty in federal court in Camden to stealing money that was purportedly for the basketball team and for school supplies for poor children. But prosecutors say he used it on himself _ for trips, fancy clothes and other personal expenses.\n\nGilliam apologized to residents in a letter Thursday afternoon.\n\n\u201cIt is with a heavy heart that I tender my resignation as the Mayor of the City of Atlantic City, effective immediately,\u201d Gilliam wrote in a letter filed with the city clerk. \u201cMy sincere apologies to each constituent that voted for me and had high hopes in my tenure.\u201d\n\nYet his lawyer issued a statement trying to lessen the perceived severity of the crime, noting that Gilliam stole private money, not public funds.\n\nGilliam stepped down shortly after New Jersey\u2019s attorney general filed court papers seeking his ouster under New Jersey\u2019s Forfeiture of Public Office law.\n\nSmall has run several times for mayor, and lost a primary to Gilliam in 2017.\n\nSmall himself has been charged twice _ and acquitted twice _ of election-related fraud in cases he maintains were politically motivated.\n\nThe city has a long, colorful history of corruption among its elected officials dating back to the turn of the century, whose malfeasance was chronicled in the HBO series \u201cBoardwalk Empire.\u201d\n\nGilliam could face 20 years in prison when he is sentenced Jan. 7.\n\n___\n\nFollow Wayne Parry at http://twitter.com/WayneParryAC\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Atlantic City will get a new mayor Friday in the wake of yet another scandal in the seaside gambling resort with a history of political corruption that inspired an award-winning TV series on HBO.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Wayne Parry"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/03/acmayor04-a_52444_c0-188-2400-1587_s1770x1032.jpg?cebf18c1f9647451ca27c25c13eff06b90074ed7", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
