I thought it was very heartfelt performance.\u2019\n\nViewers at home were quick to pick up on his remark once again and swiftly took to Twitter to share their thoughts.\n\nReally? Fans were quick to take to social media to call out the judge, 67, over his comments about the 51-year-old chat show Queen, with many honing in on their 16 year age difference\n\n'Louis Walsh saying he grew up watching Ricki Lake. He was 41 when it was first on. Explains a lot,' commented on one viewer.\n\nWhile another asked: 'Why does Louis keep saying he grew up watching Ricki Lake? I\u2019m sure he was retired when the Ricki Lake show started.'\n\n'How can Louis Walsh say he grew up watching Ricki Lake when she\u2019s 16 years younger than him???' questioned a third watcher.\n\n'Louis Walsh is 67. Ricki Lake is 51. He was sixteen when she was born. On what plane of existence did he 'grow up' watching her?' said a fourth.\n\nBig fan: 'Well Ricki, I love you and I did grow up watching you on TV. I thought it was very heartfelt performance'\n\nA fifth fan joked: '\u201cI grew up watching you\u201d 86 year old Louis Walsh to 52 year old Ricki Lake.'\n\nWith another adding: 'So Louis would've been 41 when The Ricki Lake show started . Does that mean I can stop adulting until I'm 40?'\n\nDespite the Irish manager's praise, Ricki was the first person to be eliminated from the competition after receiving the lowest amount of votes.\n\nThe TV star landed in the bottom three with Martin Bashir and Olivia Olson, with Ricki immediately leaving following the vote.\n\nThe judges then had to pick between the two, with Nicole Scherzinger chose to save her own act Martin, while Louis opted to keep his act Olivia.\n\nQuestionable: Viewers at home were quick to pick up on his remark once again and swiftly took to Twitter to share their thoughts\n\nSimon Cowell then made the final decision between Martin and Olivia, with the music mogul sending the Love Actually star home, stating who he wanted to save the person that he thought the viewers would want to see progress in the competition.\n\nHowever, this move didn't go down well with viewers at home, who declared they were 'disgusted' with his decision as he appeared to vote for popularity over actual talent.\n\nAfter learning her fate, Olivia broke down in tears, stating: 'I'm not okay' after host Dermot O'Leary asked how she felt.\n\nHowever, viewers at home were left fuming over Simon's decision as he appeared to vote for popularity over actual talent.\n\nAll over: Despite the Irish manager's praise, Ricki was the first person to be eliminated from the competition after receiving the lowest amount of votes\n\nBad decision? The deciding vote was down to Simon, who declared that he wanted to save the person that he thought the viewers would want to see progress in the competition\n\nTaking to Twitter to air their views, one person wrote: 'This is why people turn off X Factor, total joke that Olivia should be sent home.'\n\nWhile another declared: 'Someone should remind Simon Cowell that the X Factoris a singing competition. He\u2019s been handing out fashion advice and putting through people who can\u2019t sing. The man has actually lost his marbles. No wonder Little Mix left Syco.'\n\nA third said: 'I thought this was meant to be a singing contest @SimonCowell ??? I won\u2019t be watching this anymore what a load of bull that decision was.'\n\n'I have just watched the live shows and I am truly disgusted. They sent somebody home that can really sing but who hadn\u2019t chosen a good song over somebody who can\u2019t sing one note in tune. It\u2019s ridiculous that Simon Cowell would bluntly choose popularity over real talent,' ranted a fourth.\n\nWith a fifth person adding: 'Cowell has lost the capacity to make a professional decision. To put someone who cannot sing through, based on popularity and an emotional backstory? I like Martin as a human but come on. Cowell has become TOO SOFT!'\n\nDecision time: Deciding between the two acts, Nicole Scherzinger chose to save her own act Martin, while Louis Walsh opted to keep his act Olivia", "description": "X Factor: Celebrity viewers were left in stitches as they ruthlessly mocked judge Louis Walsh, 67, who declared that he 'grew up' watching Ricki Lake, 51.", "authors": ["Niomi Harris For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/19/20252774-0-image-a-32_1572203846552.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
