Give my purse to charity. First responders.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this week, Edgar said he was ready to fight McGregor, a former UFC lightweight and featherweight champion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll fight Conor at any weight class. We can do 55, 70, he's gonna be bigger than me regardless of what weight we fight at,\u201d Edgar said in quotes reported by MMA Weekly .\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been saying he wants to fight me. I\u2019m hearing he wants to fight me. And he has the control.\n\n\"I don\u2019t know if the UFC is into it, but ultimately I believe Conor has the choice. If he really wants to fight me, we\u2019ll fight.\u201d", "description": "McGregor wants a match-up with Edgar in December and told UFC chief White he'll give his purse to charity", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20069270.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FILE-Conor-McGregor-Retires-From-MMA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
