Trade, Hog Disruptions Mean Slowest Brazil Soy Growth Since 2006\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Explore what\u2019s moving the global economy in the new season of the Stephanomics podcast.

Then again, trade wars don\u2019t last forever and the spread of African swine fever in Asia is undermining feed demand. Weather and currency moves offer further variables.\n\nThe upshot is expected to be a modest 1.8% increase in planted area from the previous season, according to the average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That would be the slowest rate of expansion in 13 years, trailing the 3.5% five-year average and the 5% annual rate of the past 10 seasons.\n\nStill, even modest growth will be enough to see Brazil surpass the U.S. as the world\u2019s largest soybean producer and consolidate it as the top exporter. The nation may harvest 123 million metric tons in the 2019-2020 season, considering estimates based on trend-line yield projections. State forecaster Conab is scheduled to present its first 2019-2020 crop estimate on Oct. 10.\n\n\u201cCosts are high this season, and farmers don\u2019t want to take risks,\u201d said Oswaldo Pasqualotto, a grower in southern Mato Grosso state. \u201cI\u2019d say this is the year with the highest uncertainties of the past 10 or 15 years.\u201d\n\nWhile trading houses have avoided long-term purchases as they wait for China-U.S. talks, farmers are delaying fieldwork because of the weather, Pasqualotto said by telephone. He intends to sow soy in 11,000 hectares (27,200 areas) but hasn\u2019t planted anything yet because it\u2019s too hot and dry.\n\nWhile the trade war has kept demand for Brazilian soy strong this year, the premium for beans shipped from Brazilian ports is less than half of year-ago levels. That\u2019s because swine fever has decimated China\u2019s hog herd and curbed the Asian nation\u2019s demand for the oilseed used as feed. Brazil\u2019s soy exports to China declined 16% through September, government data show.\n\n\u201cPremiums haven\u2019t compensated question marks in different variables,\u201d Luiz Fernando Roque, an analyst at Safras & Mercado consulting firm, said by telephone. \u201cThough the trade war has been positive for Brazilian farmers, it also brings a lot of uncertainties.\u201d\n\nCurrency swings are another variable. While a weaker real against the dollar signals higher prices for farmers and a reason to plant more, it also means higher costs. Roque expects the modest soy expansion to occur as farmers switch from other crops and pastures rather than opening up new areas.\n\nA conservative approach by farmers is also on show in the slow pace of seeding this season, according to Vitor Ikeda, an analyst from Rabobank in Sao Paulo. Producers have been waiting for better moisture conditions before intensifying fieldwork amid a \u201cchallenging outlook\u201d in terms of prices and margins, he said.\n\nOn Sept. 26, soybean seeding was 0.9% complete in the nation, down from the five-year-average of 2.8%, according to figures from the AgRural consultancy. That\u2019s far below the 4.6% in the same period last year, when ample rains allowed early planting.\n\nWhile the slow pace of the soybean seeding isn\u2019t a concern in terms of crop yields so far, it worries farmers who plan to cultivate corn during the winter, just after the oilseed harvest. Significant delays on the soybean crop may shorten the ideal window for winter-corn planting.", "description": "Trade, Hog Disruptions Mean Slowest Brazil Soy Growth Since 2006", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEE96134_L.jpg"}
