In 2016, he openly encouraged Russia to snoop on Hillary Clinton\u2019s email. More recently, he said he would listen to foreigners who came to him with dirt on opponents.\n\nHere are some questions and answers about why the Ukraine matter has now become a full-blown scandal.\n\nHow did the whistleblower complaint happen?\n\nSomeone in the government, under the umbrella of US intelligence, saw or heard something that raised a credible and \u201curgent concern\u201d about how someone else in government did or said something that \u201cinvolves confidential and potentially privileged communications by persons outside the intelligence community\u201d.\n\nThat\u2019s according to Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for intelligence. The contents of the complaint remain a closely held secret. But reporting has revealed that the complaint was based on a series of events, one of which was a 25 July call between Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nWhat has Trump said about the complaint?\n\n\u201cJust another political hack job.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have conversations with many leaders. It\u2019s always appropriate.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I discussed.\u201d\n\nWhat have Democrats said?\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that if reports about the complaint bear out, Trump will face \u201cserious repercussions\u201d and the nation will have \u201cgrave, urgent concerns for our national security\u201d.\n\nPelosi has resisted pressure from members to impeach Trump over his links to Russia. She will find her every word on this matter scrutinized for signs of whether this makes her want to move ahead.\n\nOn Sunday Adam Schiff, the Democratic chair of the House intelligence committee, told CNN \u201cwe may have crossed the Rubicon\u201d regarding impeachment.\n\nWhere does Ukraine come into this?\n\nBiden was vice-president, with some influence over US policy on Ukraine, when his son Hunter was on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian businessman.\n\nTrump has been calling for more scrutiny of that period and attributing corrupt motives to the business and government work of the Biden family, without putting forward evidence of wrongdoing, undeterred by the revelation of the whistleblower complaint.\n\nThe question is whether Trump personally pressed Zelenskiy to investigate the Bidens in their call or other times and, if so, whether seeking or accepting such help from a foreign leader to benefit his re-election constitutes a misuse of presidential power. That question can\u2019t be answered with what\u2019s known so far.\n\nIs this Russia redux?\n\nThere are some similarities with the episode investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller, the aggressive effort by Russia to tilt the 2016 election to Trump. There are also differences, as well as much that remains unknown.\n\nThe Mueller report informed or reminded everyone that it is illegal for a political campaign to accept a \u201cthing of value\u201d from a foreign government. It could be argued that an investigation by a foreign government meant to harm a political opponent would be a thing of value, and pressing for one could be perilous for a US president.\n\nIt could also be argued that it is not. The Trump administration has had longstanding complaints about corruption in Ukraine and asking for corruption to be investigated is, on the surface, different than the potential collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign which Mueller investigated.\n\nOne striking twist is that pressure for a Ukrainian investigation of the Bidens has come most publicly not from the government or the campaign, but from Trump\u2019s personal lawyer. Rudy Giuliani has been working for months to get Ukraine\u2019s leadership to investigate the Bidens.\n\nWhat has Giuliani been doing?\n\nIn May, Giuliani scrapped plans to take his case for a Biden investigation directly to authorities in Kiev, when word got out about the trip. But he\u2019s been talking to Ukrainians about it.\n\nAt the time, he tweeted: \u201cExplain to me why Biden shouldn\u2019t be investigated if his son got millions from a Russian loving crooked Ukrainian oligarch while He was VP and point man for Ukraine.\u201d\n\nTrump tag-teamed him , telling Fox News: \u201cI\u2019m hearing it\u2019s a major scandal, major problem.\u201d\n\nAsked Thursday on CNN if he had pressed Ukrainian leaders to investigate the Bidens, Giuliani said: \u201cOf course I did\u201d seconds after saying, \u201cNo, actually I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWhere\u2019s the whistleblower complaint?\n\nUnder wraps. Only bits and pieces of information about it have emerged because the administration has balked at showing it to Congress, much less to the public.\n\nAtkinson, the inspector general, received the complaint on 12 August, reviewed it and found it credible and urgent, and forwarded it two weeks later to Joseph Maguire, acting director of national intelligence.\n\nMaguire\u2019s office decided the complaint was outside the agency\u2019s jurisdiction and not urgent, and informed Congress on 9 September of the situation without showing it the complaint. Atkinson said that was a break from normal procedure, which is to disclose the contents to lawmakers.\n\nHouse Democrats began to suspect that Trump was the subject of the complaint and quickly followed with a subpoena, yet to be satisfied.\n\nAtkinson appeared before the House intelligence committee behind closed doors on Thursday but declined, under administration orders, to tell lawmakers the substance of the complaint.\n\nMaguire has agreed to give public testimony on 26 September and both are expected to talk to the Senate intelligence committee next week.", "description": "Here\u2019s what you need to know about the whistleblower\u2019s complaint that the White House is refusing to release to Congress", "authors": ["Associated Press In Washington"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c511e7eb806e38092353955b88f8716fe0f7bbe9/0_16_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d0e6b2733c604889fb12b7147f9b0e0c", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
