Dr Cooper said: 'Interestingly, we see no improvement. Even recent collections are biased.'", "description": "A study of five museums found women weren't the only females forced to fight sexism - apparently leopards and lions face it, too, with the famous London collection accused of being prejudiced.", "authors": ["Victoria Allen Science Correspondent For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/00/20060698-0-image-a-18_1571786244195.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
