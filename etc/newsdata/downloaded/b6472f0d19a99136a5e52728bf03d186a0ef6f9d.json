At the time of writing, more than two million people had RSVPd that they're attending the Facebook event, \"Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us.\"\n\nAlthough the Facebook event began as a joke, people still planned on flooding the surrounding area, booking hotel reservations and paying to stay at nearby campsites. Organizers of the Facebook event then announced they would put on a music festival called Alienstock near Area 51 for people coming to the area.\n\nRead more: Millions of people signed up to storm Area 51 in September \u2014 here's a look at what the invaders will find when they hit the small Nevada town\n\nThe festival was planned to take place in the tiny town of Rachel, Nevada, which has a population of just over 50. Last month, local authorities told Buzzfeed News they were concerned about the town's ability to host the thousands of people expected, especially because Rachel reportedly has no gas stations or grocery stores.\n\nIn recent days, the organizers of Alienstock \u2014 Matty Roberts and Frank DiMaggio \u2014 raised concerns to media outlets that the event wouldn't have the proper resources, including water, food, security, and toilets. Citing these concerns, the organizers announced this week they were pulling their support from Alienstock, saying they were concerned the event could become the next Fyre Festival \u2014 referring to the failed music festival in the Bahamas back in 2017.\n\n\"Due to the lack of infrastructure, poor planning, risk management and blatant disregard for the safety of the expected 10,000+ AlienStock attendees, we decided to pull the plug on the festival,\" the Alienstock website says. \"We are not interested in, nor will we tolerate any involvement in a FYREFEST 2.0. We foresee a possible humanitarian disaster in the works, and we can't participate in any capacity at this point.\"\n\nInstead, the Facebook event organizers are throwing Alienstock's support behind a free Area 51 celebration event taking place in downtown Las Vegas on September 19.\n\nNevertheless, a permit for an event was issued to the owner of a motel, called called Little A'le'Inn, in the small town of Rachel. Connie West told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that although Alienstock organizers have pulled their support from a festival in Rachel, she is still planning an event there. Alienstock organizers said West had not been transparent about adequate planning ahead of the festival, but West has said she's secured 20 bands and proper arrangements.\n\n\"So, yeah, it's going forward,\" West told the Review-Journal. \"We're going to throw the best party that we can.\"", "description": "Area 51 has gotten attention this summer after a Facebook event calling on people to storm the mysterious Nevada desert site went viral.", "authors": ["Paige Leskin"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d780b522e22af115f63197e-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
