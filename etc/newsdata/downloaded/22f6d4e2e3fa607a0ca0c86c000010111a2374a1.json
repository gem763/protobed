He faces up to 15 years in prison.\n\nZuberi's defense attorney declined to comment.\n\nZuberi, 49, is accused of soliciting donations from foreign nationals and companies and giving the money to several political campaigns, violating a federal law that forbids foreign contributions. He claimed he could use his influence to change foreign policy and create business opportunities for clients and himself.\n\nProsecutors have not alleged any campaign that received money from Zuberi was aware of his scheme or that any foreign nationals were aware of wrongdoing, and they did not identify the campaigns or foreign nationals in court papers.\n\nIn this Dec. 12, 2016 photo, Los Angeles venture capitalist Imaad Zuberi, far left, arrives at Trump Tower in New York.

(AP Photo/Kathy Willens)\n\nBut The Associated Press reported this week that a Saudi tycoon and his business associate sent hundreds of thousands of dollars through Zuberi to help pay for President Barack Obama's second inaugural celebration.\n\nZuberi signed a plea agreement admitting he received $850,000 from Sheikh Mohammed Al Rahbani but delivered just $97,500 of that money to the Obama inaugural committee, skimming the rest for himself.\n\nRahbani is not named in the plea agreement, but The AP identified him in part by matching the timing and amounts of donations mentioned in the court filing to publicly available campaign finance records.\n\nRahbani initially declined to comment. But his attorney sent a letter to The AP on Wednesday saying that Rahbani and his wife, Kate Rahbani, had been unwitting victims of Zuberi's crimes. The attorney, Martin Auerbach, suggested Rahbani's name had been attached to political contributions without his consent.\n\n\"They have fully cooperated with the government in its investigation of Zuberi and have not been charged with any wrongdoing,\" Auerbach wrote in the letter, referring to Rahbani and his wife.\n\nAuerbach also said Kate Rahbani, an American citizen, made the donations to Obama's inauguration and not her husband.\n\nThat account differed from charges outlined in Zuberi's charging documents, which say the money Zuberi used to pay Obama's inaugural committee was wired to him by Mohammed Al Rahbani and an associate through a company based in Saudi Arabia and another based in Kuwait. Prosecutors also say in the court filings that Zuberi spoke with Mohammed Al Rahbani about donating additional money to the inaugural fund in exchange for appearing in a photograph with Obama at an event.\n\nZuberi also admitted violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act by submitting false statements in which he concealed a multi-million-dollar contract he signed in 2014 with the Sri Lankan government to help improve that country's image in the United States.\n\nProsecutors said he directed millions of dollars from that deal to himself and his wife for personal purposes, shortchanging lobbyists, public relations and law firms, and certain subcontractors who were part of the lobbying effort.\n\nProsecutors also recently charged a former college classmate and business associate of Zuberi's accused of participating in the Sri Lankan scheme. Mark Adam Skarulis was charged in September with one misdemeanor count of failing to file a tax return.\n\nA message was sent to Skarulis' defense attorney seeking comment.\n\nZuberi's donations have also been separately scrutinized by federal prosecutors in New York after he gave $900,000 to Trump's inaugural committee. That donation was not part of his federal criminal case in Los Angeles.\n\n___\n\nMustian reported from New York.
