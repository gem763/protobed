The trustees of all large funds are companies. In the case of non-profit funds, the shareholders in the company are unions and industry groups. The shares are commonly owned 50 per cent by one or more unions and 50 per cent by an employer group.\n\nEach shareholder, or sponsoring organisation, is able to nominate a number of directors. Often the shareholder nominates one of its own executives.\n\nIn the case of a retail fund, the trustee is owned by a bank or financial services company.\n\nThere have been concerns that unions are more preoccupied with patronage than good governance, while the royal commission heard how banks, motivated by profit, tipped super members into their products even if they were poor performing.\n\nThe Coalition has tried, but failed, to enact legislation requiring more independent directors on super fund boards.\n\nIn talks about a merger between Equip Super and Energy Super in 2016, Mr Fairley insisted that all nominees for directorships be assessed by an independent third party to strike the right skills mix.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnergy Super chairman Scott Wilson told the royal commission during a hearing in August the deal turned sour because Mr Fairley was against having union officials on the board \u2013 a claim Mr Fairley denies. \"We are not anti-union, we are pro-skills,\u201c he said at the time.\n\nLast year, the Coalition appointed Mr Fairley to the board of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, which replaced several ombudsman offices.\n\nMr Hayne did not go so far to as to extend the best interests duty to shareholders but, according to Mr Fairley, he may as well have.\n\nThe government has beefed up the law so that trustees who fail to act in the best interests of members face civil penalties.\n\nMr Fairley said he thought Commissioner Hayne\u2019s statement about trustees being required to do \"whatever it takes\" to challenge obstructionist shareholders was highly consequential.\n\n\u201cIn relation to board composition, he stated that in the process of nominating or selecting skilled or efficient directors, the trustee board must give priority to the interests of members over the interests of any other person, including a nominating body of that director who would often be a shareholder of the trustee,\" he said.\n\nEY national superannuation leader and partner Maree Pallisco said many super fund constitutions bestowed on shareholders the ability to appoint directors but the trustee could always push back. \"I know that has happened in some funds,\" she said.\n\n\"But I'm unaware of anybody having tested it in court.\"\n\n\"I also think the new prudential standards around strategic planing and member outcomes place additional pressure on the board to make sure they've got the right people around the table.\"\n\nMs Pallisco said skills were important, but so too was having enough time to dedicate to the role.\n\n\"What's key going forward is that individuals have the commitment to act as a director. It's not just a day a month or a day a quarter. Certainly there is a lot of work for directors and I'm hearing from a number of non-executive directors that there is a lot more work now than there has been in the past.\"", "description": "Kenneth Haye\u2019s missed message is that superannuation fund trustees should take their shareholders to court if they insist on appointing dud directors.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2821%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_213/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/82701412ac7b28893c64f527a7070ccdd2d94092", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
