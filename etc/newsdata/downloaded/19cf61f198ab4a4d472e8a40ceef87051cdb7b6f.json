The mass shooting at the Century 16 Theater multiplex owned by Cinemark USA Inc killed 12 and wounded 70.\n\nThe gunman, James Holmes, is serving multiple life sentences after being convicted of mass murder, despite pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.\n\nThe new film depicts the mental breakdown of the Joker character, the nemesis of Batman in various movie, television and comic book adaptations, that leads to violence.\n\nThe families\u2019 letter also urged Warner Bros. to end political contributions to candidates who take money from the National Rifle Association and to fund gun violence intervention programs.\n\nIn response, Warner Bros. issued a statement of sympathy for the victims and their families, Entertainment Weekly said.\n\n\u201cOur company has a long history of donating to victims of violence, including Aurora, and in recent weeks, our parent company joined other business leaders to call on policymakers to enact bipartisan legislation to address this epidemic,\u201d Warner Bros. said, media reported.\n\nBut the movie does not endorse real-world violence and does not hold up the Batman villian as a hero, it added.\n\nLos Angeles police aim to step up visibility during the film\u2019s opening weekend.\n\n\u201cThe Los Angeles Police Department is aware of public concerns and the historical significance associated with the premiere of the Joker,\u201d it said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix poses at the premiere of \"Joker\" at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada September 9, 2019.
