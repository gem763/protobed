Here Is Why", "language": "en", "text": "Tether has sent out another large portion of USDT towards Binance today. The issuer of the most popular stable coin has sent $300 million worth of USDT to the world\u2019s largest exchange. According to the official page, it\u2019s because they are conducting another chain swap from the Omni protocol to the ERC20 one. This could mean that the Ethereum network will get even more USDT ERC20-based transactions on it, causing further usage and potential challenges for its blockchain.\n\n300M USDT Sent To Binance\n\nTether, the issuer of the most popular stable coin USDT, has transferred 300 million USDT to the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency exchange, Binance. The transaction was caught by the Twitter bot Whale Alert.\n\nAlmost immediately after that, Tether fired a statement with an explanation for the large amount of USDT being transferred.\n\nIn few hours Tether will coordinate with a 3rd party to perform a chain swap (conversion from Omni to ERC20 protocol) for 300M USDt. Tether total supply will not change during this process. \u2014 Tether (@Tether_to) September 12, 2019\n\nApparently, they are doing yet another chain swap, converting Omni-based USDT into ERC20-based ones. This means that the amount is going to be transacted on the network of Ethereum.\n\nEthereum Facing Further Challenges?\n\nAs reported by CryptoPotato earlier, USDT ERC-20 transactions hit their all-time high recently. Even though according to Etherscan.io their number has decreased a bit since September 6th, they still make up a significant portion of all the transactions carried out on Ethereum\u2019s network.\n\nAt the time of this writing, Ethereum\u2019s network is working at 93% capacity, meaning that there\u2019s only 7% left before it reaches the maximum. This suggests that there is little to no room left for new projects to use the blockchain.\n\nThis is a growing concern because Tether has become one of the main projects to use the network and other developers of decentralized apps are steadily getting left behind.\n\nWhile there are some solutions in the making, including Sharding and Plasma, it appears that the scalability issue is becoming a major concern for Ethereum and something that has to be handled as quickly as possible.\n\nIn the words of Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, the increasing utilization could cause the transaction costs to spike up as well. This could make potential corporate users hesitate to use the network.\n\nBe the first to know about our price analysis, crypto news and trading tips: Follow us on Telegram or subscribe to our weekly newsletter.\n\n", "description": "Tether has sent out another large portion of USDT towards Binance today.
