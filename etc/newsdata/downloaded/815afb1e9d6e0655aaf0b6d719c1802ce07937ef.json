So, from remaining positive to dealing with the office, we have 7 sure-fire ways to live well through this important stage of life...\n\nRemaining positive, eating well and exercising, taking specialist supplements and having a load of helpful hacks up your sleeve is the easiest way to live well during the menopause\n\n1) Focus on fitness\n\nExercise is a wonderful way to get you through a time of change. Whether you focus on taking yoga or Pilates classes to help quieten the mind, start getting back to nature with hikes or wild swimming groups or simply go for it on the treadmill at the gym, working out is a simple way to boost your mood and make you feel better overall - so pull on those trainers and get that heart rate up.\n\nFitness is a mega mood-lifter - so find your exercise lane and stick to it\n\n2) Take natural supplements\n\nOestrogen has a positive effect on the production of collagen, a substance that forms part of the bone matrix and skin structure.\n\nAfter the menopause, oestrogen levels and hence collagen production decline, which can cause a series of changes to the body including our skin. Support your nutritional needs through a healthy, balanced diet and consider taking Menopace Original, the UK's number one menopause supplement.\n\nMenopace from Vitabiotics is specially formulated to help you during the menopause, and is an award-winner at the Boots Vitamin Awards\n\nAn effective one-a-day supplement of 22 nutrients scientifically formulated for during and after this period of change - and it's a hit with customers, winning top honours at the Boots Vitamin Awards 2017.\n\nMenopace includes vitamin C which helps with collagen formation for the normal function of skin, cartilage, teeth, bones and blood vessels. It also includes thiamin (vitamin B1) which contributes to the normal heart function alongside vitamin B6 which contributes to the regulation of hormonal activity. The formula also contains moderate dietary levels of Soya Isoflavone extract, to provide Daidzein, Glycitein and Genistein Isoflavones, which are naturally occurring plant compounds.\n\nVitamin B12, biotin and minerals copper and iron contribute to normal energy release, plus vitamin D contributes to normal function of the immune system.\n\n3) Don't skip meals!\n\nRegular, healthy meals filled with protein and ideally some natural plant phytoestrogens is a must during the menopause\n\nWhile it can be common to put on weight during menopause, it's important not to skip meals.\n\nIn fact, eating regular meals is important, and cutting way back on food in a bid to lose a few pounds could actually have the opposite effect.\n\nFocus your meals around protein rich foods, whole foods such as pulses and grains, fresh fruit and vegetables and foods naturally high in phytoestrogens. These natural plant compounds that have been linked to mimicking the effects of oestrogen, and include soy products, such as tempeh (made from fermented soy beans) and tofu, sesame seeds and linseeds.\n\n4) Keep socialising\n\nEven if you're feeling fatigued and want to stay in, it's important you have a network of other women going through the same experience - or simply sympathetic pals and colleagues.\n\nThat's why you need to keep socialising; not only is it great to share your concerns with others, nothing keeps the mind in a positive place than laughter with friends - even if you are being self-deprecating about your experiences!\n\nLaughter really is the best medicine - and while it can be easy to cut yourself off if you're not feeling your best, it's so important to keep socialising\n\n5) Keep cool at bedtime\n\nFatigue can be one of the hardest parts of the menopause, especially if your sleep pattern is affected. If you're waking up regularly, a few tweaks to your routine can make a big difference:\n\n* Wear light clothing made from natural fibres, such as cotton\n\n* Have a cool shower before bed\n\n* Prevent spiking your body's stress levels by avoiding triggers, such as spicy food, alcohol or caffeine\n\n* Use a fan or cooling gel pillow to combat overheating\n\nAlso, make sure you keep phones out of the bedroom to prevent them waking you up or keeping your brain active too late by our overuse of scrolling through different apps.\n\n6) Remain the business at work\n\nOne of the trickier things to deal with during this stage is the office - but there are a few things you can do that will make the everyday easier.\n\nFirstly, check if you work has a menopause policy. If not, talk to your boss about possible flexible working patterns to help combat foggy mornings after a bad night's sleep.\n\nSome public sector jobs have counsellors on hand to help with menopause-related issues, so make use of what is available to you. Organisations such as Henpicked, one of UK\u2019s largest, fastest growing websites for women, offers guidance, support and tips and even menopause in the workplace training.\n\nBut even the simplest of tweaks make a big difference; a desk fan being an obvious one.\n\n7) Stay in the moment!\n\nThe most important message to get across to yourself when dealing with the menopause is that you are not ill! You are simply going through a time in your life when your body is changing.\n\nAnd seeing as your body is changing, it's the perfect time for change overall - so think about your life in a positive way and take this as a chance to make it better.\n\nMindfulness is a great way to do this, as is meditation - taking just a few minutes out the day, not only for yourself, but for your thoughts, which can have a great calming effect on the mind.", "description": "It's a natural part of ageing for every woman - and should be treated as such", "authors": ["Mailonline Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/15/19112408-0-image-a-2_1571322319073.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
