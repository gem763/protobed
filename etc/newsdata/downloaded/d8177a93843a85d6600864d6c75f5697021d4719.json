If this is the \u2018launching point\u2019 for House Democrats\u2019 impeachment process, they\u2019ve already overplayed their hand. It\u2019s clear there is no quid pro quo that the Democrats were desperately praying for,\u201d McConnell said in a statement for this story.\n\nThose comments come on the heels of McConnell allowing a nonbinding sense of the Senate resolution to pass on Tuesday that directed the Trump administration to share a whistleblower complaint about Trump\u2019s interactions with foreign leaders with congressional intelligence committees.\n\nMcConnell confidant s said allowing the resolution through was harmless while blocking it could have attracted unwanted attention; the whistleblower complaint arrived on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3888/1155968404_6089163104001_6089162887001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nReading the tea leaves, Democrats say the move was evidence McConnell is feeling the heat on the president\u2019s conduct. But Republicans aren\u2019t so sure.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got ice in his veins. I\u2019ve never seen anybody like it,\u201d said Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), who\u2019s only served along McConnell in the Senate for nine months. \u201cHe\u2019s seen it all, so he doesn\u2019t panic.\u201d\n\nTrump and McConnell have developed a real partnership over the past two years that has proven durable despite Trump occasionally dinging McConnell for not repealing Obamacare or eliminating the filibuster. McConnell and Trump speak with some frequency about legislation, nominations and Senate races, and Trump often counts McConnell as a close political adviser.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether McConnell and Trump have discussed the Ukraine controversy, but McConnell has put at least some daylight between them on the issue. On the Senate floor this week, the Kentucky Republican said he personally urged the Defense secretary and the secretary of State to release military aid to Ukraine, which had been reportedly withheld at Trump\u2019s behest.\n\nBut what does McConnell think about the very real possibility that his chamber will have to hold an impeachment trial in the coming months? Long-serving senators say they\u2019ve given up trying to divine his next move.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s concerned about it, nobody should ever know,\u201d said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) \u201cAnd if he\u2019s not concerned about it, you\u2019re not going to know.\u201d\n\nPlus, McConnell knows whatever he tells his members at party meetings may go public, so he\u2019s keeping even many in his own party on their toes.\n\nThat leaves everyone guessing about what McConnell will do next as he surveys his own reelection campaign, a defense of his Senate majority and a coming clash with House Democrats who appear increasingly likely to impeach the president.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/92/57/22be714845deaf4fee508833483a/artboard-3.png\"\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never rattled,\u201d said Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), one of McConnell\u2019s closest friends in the Senate for more than a decade. \u201cI don\u2019t expect Sen. McConnell to be rattled. I don\u2019t think he is.\u201d\n\nMcConnell\u2019s decision to allow the whistleblower resolution through \u201cis a pretty good signal that there is concern among Republicans,\u201d argued Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). \u201cMost of us [were] expecting him to oppose it. As he has done every effort to seek transparency.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday morning, McConnell declined to answer a question about whether the Senate will hold an impeachment trial, a gray area in the Senate\u2019s impeachment rules. Most Republicans think the Senate would respond in some way if the House impeaches the president rather than try to ignore it.\n\nBut there\u2019s been no real discussion about that among Senate Republicans with McConnell. In fact, other than guidance from Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) there\u2019s been little real discussion among Senate Republicans about the slog that\u2019s before them.\n\nMcConnell doesn\u2019t want to get out in front of a rapidly changing storyline. In just the past week, the whistleblower story fully emerged, Trump confirmed reports that he mentioned former Vice President Joe Biden in his discussions with President Volodymyr Zelensky and then released a White House summary of that very conversation. On Thursday , the Senate Intelligence Committee will hear from the acting director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire.\n\n\u201cEverybody, including the leader, should be trying to get as many facts about this one issue collected as quickly as we can and not reaching very many conclusions on it until we get them,\u201d said one Republican senator. And \u201cMitch is instinctively careful anyway.\u201d\n\nSen. Thom Tillis. | Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nBut rank-and-file senators have been reacting on the fly, with a span of comments ranging from Mitt Romney (R-Utah) saying he is \u201ctroubled in the extreme\u201d by Trump bringing up Biden to Zelensky to Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) decrying \u201canother pathetic attempt by Democrats to destroy President Trump with falsehoods.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould it have been better that he not brought up Biden\u2019s name? Yes. But the rush to judgment by the other body I think is totally unwarranted,\u201d said Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who had questioned Trump personally about why aid to Ukraine was held up. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about changing the results of an election of the United States. Pretty serious.\"\n\nTrump is intensely interested in the mood on the Hill, calling at least two Senate Republicans directly on Tuesday evening ahead of the transcript\u2019s release, according to people familiar with the conversations, and dialing into a White House meeting with congressional Republicans on Wednesday morning. It became clear at a party lunch that, Romney aside, the party for now has the president\u2019s back.\n\n\u201cThe feeling in the room was relief. We all were told that this is some kind of shakedown by Trump,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about changing the results of an election of the United States. Pretty serious.\" - Sen. Rob Portman\n\nMcConnell\u2019s autobiography is called the \u201cLong Game,\u201d and it might as well describe how he\u2019s going to handle the road to a potential impeachment trial. Foremost on the majority leader\u2019s mind this week is funding the government past Sept. 30, no easy task given the failure of the House and Senate to agree on spending bills.\n\nInstead the GOP leader has to rally support for an unpopular continuing resolution.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a lay-up by any stretch. Hell, we\u2019ve got 20 people that don\u2019t vote for appropriations,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cI do think his personal attention and energy are probably more focused on getting through the week, getting things done that we need.\u201d\n\nFew would say that funding the government is not a priority. But Democrats say that McConnell\u2019s shrug at Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelensky as the House moves toward impeachment underscores their devil\u2019s bargain with the president.\n\n\u201cI know what a lot of them think personally of him, that he\u2019s an embarrassment and he\u2019s bad for the country,\" Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) said of Republicans. \"But they get their tax cuts and their young right-wing extremist judges.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Sen.
