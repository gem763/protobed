They can\u2019t take our baseball away from us, can they?\n\nThe Appalachian League might be a thing of the past if a proposal made by Major League Baseball passes. MLB wants to reorganize the minor leagues and the plan reportedly includes eliminating the two Advanced Rookie leagues, the Appalachian League and the Pioneer League.\n\nIn Johnson City, the Cardinals games have become a summer-long form of entertainment for entire families. TVA Credit Union Ballpark has turned into a virtual amusement park, which is one reason the franchise continues to flourish.\n\nThe team has won the league\u2019s promotional award several times, thanks in no small part to an exciting atmosphere created by the current administration put in place by Boyd Sports.\n\nWhat\u2019s better on a warm summer night than having a hot dog and a cold beer while watching a baseball game? And in the rookie leagues, it\u2019s all done on an affordable basis.\n\nWith $5 tickets, $1 sodas and beers on many nights and food promotional discounts, it doesn\u2019t cost an arm and a leg to attend a Cardinals game. That\u2019s one reason more than 80,000 fans went through the gates this year. It was the fourth year in a row that the franchise attendance record was broken.\n\nIf MLB has its way, it will all be taken away after the 2020 season.\n\nIn all, the MLB proposal, originally reported by Baseball America, calls for the elimination of as many as 42 teams. Eighteen towns would be without Rookie League baseball. Many of these municipalities have had baseball for decades and have poured their souls - and resources - into supporting the home team.\n\nThat\u2019s where it might get dicey for MLB. Hopefully the towns don\u2019t go down without a fight.\n\nJohnson City taxpayers footed the bill for the new lights at TVA Credit Union Ballpark. It\u2019s true that Science Hill also plays its home games there, but the city wouldn\u2019t have coughed up more than half a million dollars for lights just for the high school team.\n\nThe city of Elizabethton was basically forced to come up with $1.5 million to renovate the clubhouse at Joe O\u2019Brien Field under the threat of the Twins moving elsewhere.\n\nNow that taxpayers have ponied up the cash, the possibility of the league disbanding has to be harrowing.\n\nIf the proposal passes as it stands, MLB is likely to be subject to numerous lawsuits from cities that were told to spend taxpayers\u2019 money for ballpark improvements only to have the teams vanish into thin air.\n\nFor now, the proposal is just that - a proposal. Further negotiations will take place with offers and counteroffers being made before anything is decided.\n\nThe next negotiations between MLB and Minor League Baseball are scheduled for November. Hopefully whatever agreement is reached doesn\u2019t ultimately include taking cities like Johnson City and Elizabethton out of the ballgame.\n\nSave for a stretch in the \u201860s and early \u201870s when the Phillies and Yankees were here, Johnson City has been affiliated with the St. Louis Cardinals since 1939. An attack on the Appalachian League is an attack on our history and our way of life.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to express your displeasure with MLB\u2019s proposal, write to Commissioner Rob Manfred at The Office of the Commissioner of Baseball, 245 Park Avenue, 31st Floor, New York, NY 10167 or call 212-931-7800.\n\nOnline: https://www.johnsoncitypress.com\n\n___\n\nOct. 21\n\nThe Crossville Chronicle on Alzheimer\u2019s disease:\n\nAn estimated 5.8 million Americans are living with Alzheimer\u2019s dementia - a number expected to rise by almost 14 million by 2050.\n\nWhile this horrible disease robs individuals of their memories, it is also the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and a leading cause of disability and poor health.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease attacks the nerve cells and brain tissue. Over time, the brain shrinks, disrupting all its functions. Before current tests can even detect the disease, it is forming plaque and tangles in areas of the brain that govern learning, memory, thinking and planning. Individuals may have trouble organizing their thoughts, expressing themselves or handling money. It can also impact personality and behavior.\n\nEveryone experiences a memory lapse here and there, but when should you become concerned? One of the most common signs of this disease is forgetting new information or important dates or events. Some patients find themselves relying more and more on memory aids and asking the same questions over and over.\n\nPeople may also have changes in their ability to take on tasks they once did well, like following an old family recipe or losing track of monthly bills. They may have trouble driving to a familiar location, they may become confused or forget where they are or how they got there.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s can also impact balance, judging distance or determining color. They may struggle with their vocabulary - calling familiar objects by the wrong name.\n\nWhile Alzheimer\u2019s disease is a progressive disease, new tests and treatments are being developed. Early detection and treatment can slow the progression of the disease. Drugs can help treat cognitive symptoms.\n\nNew treatments are slow to emerge, though researchers are studying new drug therapies to target the way the disease works, inhibiting the development of plaques and preventing tangles from attacking brain cell transport systems. There are clinical trials underway to test the effectiveness and safety of these new therapies.\n\nBut these new treatments can be a far away for patients and families waiting on new treatment options. To help speed the process, drug makers, government advisers and nonprofit foundations have formed the Coalition Against Major Diseases to share data from clinical trials that will help speed up development of new treatment.\n\nRecently, Crossville hosted the annual Alzheimer\u2019s Tennessee Plateau Walk and the Scarecrow Festival to raise funds to help Tennesseans living with Alzheimer\u2019s and other dementia diseases. This organization offers a helpline where people can call for information, support and referrals.

What comes out of Boone Lake alone each year is a disgrace.\n\nAnd our economy suffers for it.\n\nThat was never more evident than in the letter a frequent visitor recently sent to Carter County officials about the conditions in the Watauga River she found on a fishing trip.\n\n\u201cThe Watauga Dam Campground is by far one of our most favorite places in America as we love to fly fish for trout,\u201d Florida resident Cindy McClure wrote to Carter County Mayor Rusty Barnett. \u201cWe have been coming to your area for about four years now and really really love ending the summer there. Your river is so spectacular, so clear, so loaded with trout and unfortunately so loaded with trash.\u201d\n\nMcClure\u2019s letter got the attention of Ed Jordan, founder and chairman of Keep Carter County Beautiful, an organization dedicated to protecting the county\u2019s environment. Jordan agreed with McClure\u2019s assessment that enforcement of Tennessee\u2019s litter laws is lacking in the area. In a response he penned to McClure, Jordan called enforcement the region\u2019s \u201cweakest link.\u201d\n\nWhile stricter enforcement is in order, particularly as a deterrent, we would argue that our local law enforcement agencies are up against a societal deficiency. They would find themselves becoming solely the trash police given the level of the problem.\n\nWe are our own worst enemy when it comes to our image. If the region is ever to dump its backwater image, we have to stop treating our home like one massive landfill.\n\nIf a regular visitor who loves to fish here is concerned enough to write the mayor about the old tires and other refuse dumped in the river, imagine the impression the junk must make on a first-time guest. Imagine the impression it would make on a family considering relocation. Worse, think of how it might look to an executive considering a business or industrial development here.\n\nIt\u2019s another hurdle in the recent initiative to better market this region to tourists, potential residents and employers. If our outdoor recreational opportunities are a linchpin in that equation, the beauty must be less sullied.\n\nYes, getting tougher on offenders will be key, but fixing the problem will mean a grassroots cultural shift.\n\nOnline: https://www.johnsoncitypress.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Recent editorials from Tennessee newspapers:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
