SenseTime racked up a valuation of $4.5 billion (R68 billion) last year, making it the world's highest-valued AI startup, TechCrunch reported at the time. Megvii raised $750 million (R11 billion) in May of this year, and filed for an IPO in Hong Kong in August. Yitu Technologies was most recently valued at just under $2.4 billion (R36 billion) and was reported to be in the process of gearing up for an IPO as recently as last month.\n\nThe ban will cut the named companies off from potentially crucial American suppliers - Bloomberg notes that Nvidia supplies both SenseTime and Megvii, for example - and marks a fresh escalation in the ongoing geopolitical spat even as officials prepare to sit down to resume talks next week.\n\nSenseTime, Megvii, and Yitu are well-known for their work in facial recognition software. A New York Times investigation in April found the Chinese government was using a huge network of facial recognition software to track Uighur people, and named all three companies as participants in the programme.\n\nAlso on the DoC list was iFlytek Co, a voice-recognition company which The Financial Times reported in June was looking to raise between $300 million (R4.5 billion) and $350 million (R5.3 billion) to pour into AI.\n\nNot all the tech companies listed are so AI-focused. Dahua Technology and Hikvision are prominent video surveillance companies. \"Punishing Hikvision, despite these engagements, will deter global companies from communicating with the US government, hurt Hikvision's US businesses partners and negatively impact the US economy,\" a Hikvision spokesman told Reuters.\n\nThe last two named tech companies on the list are Meiya Pico - a digital forensics and cybersecurity company - and Yixin Science and Technology, which Bloomberg reports provides big data analytics to China's police force.\n\nThis isn't the first time the Trump administration has slapped a major Chinese company with a ban. Smartphone giant Huawei was placed on the entity list in May of this year, with the US alleging that the company serves as a conduit to the Chinese government for spying. The ban has yet to come into full effect however, as the company was granted two 90-day reprieves.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The US placed 28 Chinese companies on a trade blacklist on Monday, including three AI startups valued at over $1 billion.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9445/3890205b4127410fbe0ef681ce1f8160.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
