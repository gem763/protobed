I have suffered in silence because i was too embarrassed to go my own doctor or hospital and say I have been abroad to have a breast enlargement and I\u2019ve been left in agony.\"\n\n(Image: Birmingham Mail)\n\n(Image: BPM Media)\n\n'Octomum' Marie also hit the headlines when she was forced to have her womb removed following a cancer scare, but vowed to turn to adoption to bring the number of kids in her family to a \"nice round number\".\n\nAnd now the ex-lapdancer and one of Birmingham's best-known mums claims to have been left with more scarring than she expected by the boob job in Turkey.\n\nMarie, from Selly Oak, raised the money for the surgery through car boot sales and part-time jobs as a care assistant and mechanic.\n\nBut, despite working less than 16 hours a week, the former lap dancer is still eligible for her benefits and was criticised for her decision to have the procedure.\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\n(Image: BPM Media)\n\nMarie previously defended her decision to enhance her assets and said: \"I know the trolls will start having a go at me, but I'm doing this for me and me alone so that I feel more confident.\n\n\"I do not drink or smoke. I don't go out clubbing.\n\n\"I have been saving for two-and-a-half years from my jobs and boot fairs to raise the money.\n\n\"None of it is being paid for out of my benefits. By going abroad, I have halved the cost.\"\n\n(Image: BPM Media)\n\n(Image: BPM Media)\n\nMarie and her kids live in a four-bedroom housing association property and she recently took her first job in 16 years, working one day a week as a mechanic in a garage to beat the \u00a326,000 benefits cap.\n\nShe was also criticised in 2017 for stumping up \u00a3200 per month for a horse called Bobby.\n\nBut Marie was forced to sell the horse, who was being kept at stables in Wythall, after having a hysterectomy following an abnormal smear test result.\n\nNo stranger to controversy, she also provoked outrage when she appeared on This Morning saying life was better on benefits and she would spend her wages on a boob job.\n\nShe previously claimed she was being turned down for a job as a garage mechanic - which she said was her dream - because of sexism.\n\nShe said she had applied for dozens of positions after gaining a Level 2 diploma in mechanics.\n\nBack in 2015 Marie worked for several months as a dancer at a Birmingham club.\n\nShe worked at the club in 2004 following the birth of her second daughter.\n\nAt the time she said: \u201cI thought it would be good money and lots of people were saying I should go for it. But I wasn\u2019t there for long. The money wasn\u2019t great as you had to pay up before entering the club.\n\n\u201cThere was also a lot of girls working there, so there was a lot of competition.\n\n\u201cIt was something I wanted to try and I\u2019m glad I did it, but there is always the negative part when doing something like that.\"\n\nMarie has now enrolled on a Health and Social Care course as she hopes to pick up her work again as a carer.", "description": "Headline-grabbing 'Octomum' Marie Buchan, who caused controversy when she announced her plan on This Morning, is feeling deflated by her \u00a32,500 boob job carried out in Turkey", "authors": ["Andy Richardson", "Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "Birmingham Mail", "Bpm Media", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex Shutterstock"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20464048.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_JS124433884.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
