Abby seemed tired and started to feel progressively worse, her mother told USA TODAY.\n\nAbby no longer wanted to go to Paris. Instead, she wanted to have more of a relaxing weekend, her mother said, maybe see some fall foliage and just hang out instead of adventuring around a city.\n\nPk, who works as a flight recovery agent for United, was able to get a new flight to Halifax, Nova Scotia, a SkyWest flight operating as United Express. They would postpone the Paris trip and go to Canada instead.\n\nBut as they boarded, Abby's condition began to worsen. Eventually, it got scary.\n\nAfter a trip to the bathroom, Abby came back and was lying on her mother's lap. She asked for a doctor. Her skin was cold to the touch.\n\n\"I realized Abby's really sick; this is not OK,\" Pk said. \"I'm thinking, 'I'm the worst mom ever for putting my daughter on a flight.'\"\n\nShe was borderline incoherent by that point, Pk said, but she had a pulse and was awake.\n\nPk let the flight attendants know something was seriously wrong.\n\n\"SkyWest crews sprang into action, requesting assistance from medical professionals onboard and providing oxygen and support as the child was attended to,\" Marissa Snow, spokesperson for SkyWest, told USA TODAY in an email.\n\nA nurse from Colorado was close by and overheard Pk telling the crew her daughter was sick.\n\n\"I just keyed in because I was sitting right behind her,\" Nick Wasserman told USA TODAY. \"I said, 'I'm a nurse. Can I take her pulse?' I put my hand on her radial pulse. It was really faint, but really fast.\"\n\nA doctor, Peter Laureijs, and his wife, Beth, a nurse, from Iowa, were on the flight, too. The couple jumped in to help after the flight crew asked for medical professionals.\n\nWasserman said they all \"clicked into professional mode.\" No one knew what was wrong, just that Abby was really sick. Her blood pressure was crashing and she was not responding.\n\nEventually, by using an IV drip and administering oxygen, they were able to get Abby stabilized. EMTs met Abby and Pk on the plane and took them to a local hospital.\n\nAfter a couple of days in the hospital, Abby recovered. At the hospital, doctors diagnosed Abby with Type 1 Diabetes DKA. She had been experiencing symptoms that fit, including lack of appetite, exhaustion, smelly breath, rapid breathing, stumbling, blurred vision and \"ice cold skin.\"\n\nAnd when things settled down, Pk shared the story on Facebook looking to reconnect with her daughter's saviors. Through her post and some digging, she was able to connect with Wasserman and the Laureijs.\n\nTo close that loop, was incredible, Wasserman said.\n\nHe hadn't known whether Abby even lived through the weekend. Reconnecting provided a huge sense of relief.\n\n\"We applaud our crewmembers\u2019 service, compassion and professionalism in helping take care of this small passenger and are happy to learn that she has experienced a full recovery,\" said Snow.\n\nFollow Morgan Hines on Twitter: @MorganEmHines.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2019/10/30/united-skywest-flight-has-medical-emergency-travelers-step-up/4096487002/", "description": "\"I\u00a0realized Abby's really sick; this is not OK,\" Pk\u00a0Hrezo told USA TODAY.
