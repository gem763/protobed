Raja Krishnamoorthi, Illinois Democrat, wrote in a letter to Ms. Chao.\n\nThe letter also asks Ms. Chao for documents related to her proposal to ax more than $80 million from the Maritime Security Program, which subsidizes American cargo ships to move supplies into war zones. Cuts to that program would affect America\u2019s support for the cargo industry while Foremost was being boosted by the Chinese government, the committee alleged.\n\nA Department of Transportation spokesman confirmed receipt of the letter in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to responding to the Committee\u2019s request. Media attacks targeting the Secretary\u2019s family are stale and only attempt to undermine her long career of public service,\u201d the statement said.\n\nDemocrats also want documents about Ms. Chao\u2019s 2018 failure to sell off her stock in Vulcan Materials Company, a manufacturer of road construction materials. Ms. Chao promised in 2017 she would divest that stock as part of an ethics pledge, the committee said.\n\nThe committee made 18 different requests for documents and materials, including copies of communications Ms. Chao made with her father or sister, Angela Chao, who now runs the company.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
