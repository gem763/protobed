They\u2019re sick.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person, who\u2019s the person who gave the whistle-blower the information? Because that\u2019s close to a spy,\u201d he added. An audio recording of some of the comments was posted online earlier by the Los Angeles Times.\n\nHe added what appeared to be a thinly veiled threat: \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nHe called the whistle-blower \u201chighly partisan.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s address to the U.S. mission to the UN wandered freely from Biden to the 2016 election, from coal miners to the size of Democratic Representative Adam Schiff\u2019s neck: \u201cHe\u2019s got a neck about this big,\u201d the president said as he pressed his index finger to his thumb. \u201cHe\u2019s got shirts that are too big because you can\u2019t buy shirts that are that small. He was never a coal miner, lets put it that way.\u201d\n\nThe White House had set up the guest list for the meet and greet, one person familiar said.\n\nAt one point, Trump said his only predecessor to appear more presidential than he was Abraham Lincoln.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the most presidential except for possibly Abe Lincoln when he wore the hat. That was tough to beat,\u201d Trump said. But he added: \u201cI have better hair than him.\u201d\n\nTrump repeated his claims that Joe Biden helped his son, Hunter Biden, improperly win millions in dollars in business from Ukraine and China. Those claims have been at the center of the controversy over the president\u2019s call with Zelenskiy in which he implores the Ukrainian leader to investigate the Bidens. He referred to the former vice president as \u201cSleepy Joe Biden who\u2019s dumb as a rock.\u201d\n\nTrump said he keeps alive the rumors among Democrats and the media that he would disregard presidential term limits because it drives them \u201ccrazy.\u201d He also disparaged the media coverage of his meeting in New York on Wednesday with Zelenskiy, and assailed a familiar target, CNN.\n\n\u201cYou know these animals in the press. They\u2019re animals. Some of the worst human being you\u2019ll ever meet,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re scum. Many of them are scum.\u201d\n\n\u201cBasically, that person never saw the report, never saw the call, he never saw the call, heard something and decided that he or she, or whoever the hell they saw -- they\u2019re almost a spy,\u201d Trump said of the whistle-blower.\n\nThe president also spoke of his \u201clove\u201d of coal miners and that \u201cwe gave them back their jobs.\u201d He joked about how they didn\u2019t want to be retrained for other jobs and weren\u2019t interested in his Manhattan lifestyle.\n\nTrump said he had asked miners whether they wanted to work in technology and \u201cthey almost threw up all over the place.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you imagine miners with massive arms, shoulders -- who love what they\u2019re doing -- in a line with little tiny widgets?\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019re putting little tiny computer parts together. These big strong guys? They don\u2019t want to be doing that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I said, \u2018I\u2019m going to give you an apartment on Fifth Avenue, you\u2019re going to come with me, you\u2019re going to have a great time in New York, they would say, \u2018No, no thank you.\u2019 That\u2019s just the way it is. That\u2019s their life, that\u2019s what they want.\u201d\n\nTrump also took credit for what he suggested was an improvement in the UN\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always said about the United Nations it has more potential than any institution that I\u2019ve ever dealt with,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t lived up to its potential. It\u2019s starting to more. I think one of the reasons is because I feel that way. I will use the United Nations to our benefit as a country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United Nations is going to finally live up to its potential,\u201d he said.\n\nHe told Kelly Craft, the new American ambassador to the U.N., that \u201cYou\u2019re going to be a star.\u201d Then he added: \u201cYou got to make good deals otherwise it\u2019s over.\u201d\n\n(Updates with additional comments, starting in 17th paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Nick Wadhams in Washington at nwadhams@bloomberg.net;Jennifer Jacobs in Washington at jjacobs68@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alex Wayne at awayne3@bloomberg.net, Joshua Gallu, John Harney\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump used a closed-door gathering with U.S. diplomats in New York to attack Democratic rival Joe Biden and disparage a whistle-blower complaint over his controversial phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy now at the heart of an impeachment inquiry.UkraineTranscript", "authors": ["Nick Wadhams", "Jennifer Jacobs"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GCur93576vF5P1Mr7Ktidw--~B/aD0yMzM0O3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/bfd73ad5789b6e3e4479eb742ab0a9c6", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
