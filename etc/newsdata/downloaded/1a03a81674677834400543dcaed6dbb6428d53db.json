Shares of Apache Corp <APA.N>, Helmerich and Payne <HP.N> and Cimarex Energy <XEC.N> jumped between 12% and 17% and led gainers on the S&P 500.\n\nThe Saudi-led military coalition battling Yemen's Houthi movement said the attacks were carried out with Iranian weapons, raising the prospect of a global conflict involving the United States and Iran.\n\n\"The U.S. investor is waiting with bated breath about what the U.S. and its allies might do,\" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nAnticipation of higher fuel costs drove down shares of airlines and cruise line operators with the S&P 1500 airlines index <.SPCOMALI> shedding 2.1%, while Carnival Corp <CCL.N> fell 3.2%.\n\nThe S&P 500 retailing index <.SPXRT> lost 1.4%, with retailers, which would be hurt by higher fuel prices, among the biggest drags on the S&P 500.\n\n\"The drone strike in Saudi has had an impact on how investors are looking at the security and stability of the global energy supply chain and is fueling a degree of risk reassessment,\" said Peter Kenny, founder of Kenny's Commentary LLC and Strategic Board Solutions LLC in New York.\n\nShares of defense companies Raytheon Co <RTN.N>, Lockheed Martin Corp <LMT.N> and Northrop Grumman Corp <NOC.N> rose more than 2%.

A recent easing in trade tensions has brought the benchmark S&P 500 <.SPX> about 1% below its record high.\n\nAmong other movers, General Motors Co <GM.N> fell 4.2% after the United Auto Workers went on strike on Sunday, the first nationwide strike at GM in 12 years.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.12-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.11-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted six new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 53 new highs and 28 new lows.\n\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 7.6 billion shares, compared with the 6.8 billion-share average over the last 20 trading days.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Additional reporting by Medha Singh and Ambar Warrick in Bengaluru; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Tom Brown)", "description": "Anticipation of higher fuel costs drove down shares of airlines and cruise line operators with the S&P 1500 airlines index  shedding 2.1%, while Carnival Corp  fell 3.2%.  \"The drone strike in Saudi has had an impact on how investors are looking at the security and stability of the global energy", "authors": ["Noel Randewich"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/G3FdUlWDonYDOkoSZtuNlA--~B/aD0zMjE7dz00NDk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters-finance.com/56952f4262128b71ce42d56882477a94", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
