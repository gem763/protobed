After a few days of frustration, I reached out via a different method of communication. Did they randomly change their email address or what?\n\n\u201cSorry!!! I just had to delete a bunch of emails,\u201d they replied. \u201cI ran out of storage.\u201d\n\nSpeaking as someone with 3,204 unread emails in their personal Gmail alone who hasn\u2019t yet experienced this, I was surprised and a little bit dubious, tbh. But a recent Bloomberg report suggested this is all part of Google\u2019s master plan: lure us in with free email storage, and then make us pay.\n\nAccording to the report, Google has been rolling back its free storage offerings in recent months, and pushing people onto its paid cloud subscription service Google One instead. The cost for consumers is minimal \u2013 in Australia, 100 GB of storage is $2.49 per month, or a discounted $24.99 per year \u2013 but given the sheer size of Google, it could generate billions for the company.\n\n\u201cGoogle has become a monster \u2026 on the other hand I haven\u2019t paid for email in 15 years,\u201d one person tweeted.\n\n\u201cI feel unreasonably sad about using almost all of my free Google storage,\u201d another person said. \u201cFelt intimate. Please don\u2019t make me pay!\u201d\n\nThe report calculated that even if just 10% of Gmail\u2019s more than one billion users signed up for Google One, it would generate almost US $2.4 billion per year for the company. That\u2019s a lot of money to be paid on people\u2019s reluctance to be managing their inbox.\n\nUsers still receive 15 GB of storage for free \u2013 that didn\u2019t change when Google One replaced Drive earlier this year. But if you\u2019ve spent the past decade not deleting your emails, as well as picking up content to be stored like digital balls of lint, then it might be time for a clean.\n\n@gmail my gmail is not showing me any new emails \u2013 last emails from yesterday evening. my other/linked account is working just fine. Tried updating app, accessing from desktop, etc. Same problem everywhere. Help! \u2014 Emily (@emilyyyyy) October 21, 2019\n\nGoogle has some handy tips on deleting masses amounts of emails, or else finding and deleting the randomly huge emails taking up way too much of your space. Everyone\u2019s favourite declutter queen Marie Kondo also advises not getting lost in too many folders \u2014 just use \u201cunprocessed\u201d (for anything that needs a reply or has yet to be read) and \u201csave\u201d (for anything you need to hold on to).\n\nFailing all of that, you can just go nuclear and delete your entire inbox, and hope anything that important or urgent will receive a follow up from the sender. I can\u2019t promise this will work, but I did once delete 15,000 emails in one go using this strategy, and nobody (as far as I\u2019m aware) has died yet.\n\nThe only thing you absolutely shouldn\u2019t do is sign up for extra storage, and then forget about those monthly payments for the rest of your life. It\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re hoping you\u2019ll do.", "description": "", "authors": ["Alex Bruce-Smith"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/new-gmail-lead.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
