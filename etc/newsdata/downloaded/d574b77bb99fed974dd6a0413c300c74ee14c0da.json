Monday was the Supreme Court's first day of arguments after its summer break.\n\nThe order to not hear the case keeps in place a January ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled that Domino\u2019s and other retailers must make its online services accessible. It also means the case is expected to go to trial.\n\n\"Although Domino\u2019s is disappointed that the Supreme Court will not review this case, we look forward to presenting our case at the trial court,\" Domino's said in a statement posted on its website Monday. \"We also remain steadfast in our belief in the need for federal standards for everyone to follow in making their websites and mobile apps accessible.\"\n\nVideo games are a 'great equalizer': How accessibility a winning strategy for gaming industry, players\n\nPizza Hut's mashup: The new Stuffed Cheez-It Pizza is available for a limited time\n\nGuillermo Robles, who is blind, claimed in U.S. District Court in California that the pizza maker violated the federal disability requirements because he couldn't order a pizza on his iPhone: The website didn't work with his screen-reader software.\n\n\"In today's tech-savvy world, blind and visually-impaired people have the ability to access websites and mobile applications using keyboards in conjunction with screen access software that vocalizes the visual information found on a computer screen or displays the content on a refreshable Braille display,\" the lawsuit argued.\n\nIn January, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Domino\u2019s and other retailers must make its online services accessible.\n\nRobles\u2019 attorney, Joe Manning, said in a statement to CNBC Monday that the Supreme Court's decision was \u201cthe right call on every level.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe blind and visually impaired must have access to websites and apps to fully and equally participate in modern society \u2013 something nobody disputes,\u201d he said. \u201cThis outcome furthers that critical objective for them and is a credit to our society.\u201d\n\nDomino's along with the National Retail Federation and Retail Litigation Center urged the Supreme Court to hear the case because the appeal court's ruling \"stretched the definition too far by deciding that websites and mobile applications must be judged as public accommodations rather than just considered as one of many ways in which a consumer might access a retailer\u2019s offerings.\"\n\nAccording to the pizza company, a customized pizza can be ordered in-store, by phone, text, social media and voice-activated devices like Alexa and Google Home. Domino's says it is developing a proprietary voice-ordering digital assistant, Dom.\n\n\u201cWith a growing number of website accessibility cases being filed and conflicting rulings from circuit courts across the country, this is an issue that needs the clarity of a Supreme Court ruling,\u201d said Stephanie Martz, the retail federation's senior vice president and general counsel, in a statement. \u201cWithout guidance on what rules should apply, litigation will continue to divert resources from actually making websites accessible.\u201d\n\nDomino's said in its statement that a nationwide standard would \"eliminate the tsunami of website accessibility litigation that has been filed by plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers exploiting the absence of a standard for their own benefit.\"\n\nContributing: Associated Press; Frank Witsil, Detroit Free Press\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kelly Tyko on Twitter: @KellyTyko\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Domino's Pizza website accessibility: Supreme Court won't hear case", "description": "The Supreme Court's decision to not hear Domino's case on whether its website is accessible to the disabled\u00a0is seen as a win for\u00a0disability advocates.", "authors": ["Kelly Tyko", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1N48491QCeEt30lHRCvlPg--~B/aD0zNjA7dz0zNjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://d.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/1009217/390b11cf-e5e8-440e-8710-a44163b1c697/be16c99f-0027-51f7-9497-ac1a97fe8181/data_3_0.jpg?s=bb67712680851aa23184ba79444e29e5&c=4b95be5ce243b7f5c55f3cac63c80d3d&a=tripleplay4us&mr=0", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
