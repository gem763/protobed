Johnson also failed in his bid to call a general election before the UK's planned exit date from the EU of October 31.\n\nThere were shouts of \"shame on you\" from the opposition benches as Conservative MPs left the chamber to take part in the \"proroguing\" ceremony in the neighbouring House of Lords to coincide with the closure of parliament.\n\nSome Labour MPs sought to prevent the Speaker John Bercow, from joining the ceremony. Bercow, who announced his plan to resign on Monday, told MPs he would attend but understood why others would not. \"This isn't a normal or standard prorogation,\" Bercow told MPs.\n\n\"This represents an act of executive fiat and I quite understand why very large numbers of members are much more comfortable staying where they are.\"\n\nWatch MPs protest against Johnson suspending parliament\n\nSome MPs held up placards labeled \"silenced\" as the ceremony continued, before later breaking out into a chorus of Scottish, Welsh and English anthems.\n\nBecause the Chamber is shaped like a church choir, & also because opposition parties waiting for the speaker to come back from the Lords - we're having a nationalist sing-song.
