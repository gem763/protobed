As companies are simplifying consumer transactions, will cash reach an expiration date? We explain. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nFacebook's bid to launch an alternative digital currency, called Libra, has gotten much tougher.\n\nBig partners announced by Facebook have just dropped out. That includes credit card giants Visa and MasterCard, e-commerce giant eBay, payments startup Stripe and Latin America payment app Mercado Pago. PayPal had previously switched course on Libra.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big setback for them but it\u2019s not the end,\u201d Gartner analyst Avivah Litan told the Associated Press.\n\nMonday, the Geneva based Libra Association that Facebook formed, is scheduled to convene its first official meeting, and lost the key players before the gavel went down.\n\n\"It\u2019s not the end for Libra, but the project faces a hard path moving forward \u2013 and it\u2019s only getting harder,\" notes TheVerge.\n\nCalibra, Facebook's digital wallet for its Libra cryptocurrency.

Elizabeth Warren has made it a hallmark of her presidential campaign to do just that, and has gotten into a war of words with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nZuckerberg responded that if Warren was elected and looked to break up Facebook, that would \"suck\" and he would fight her in court.\n\n\"What would really \u2018suck\u2019 is if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anti-competitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy,\" Warren tweeted in response.\n\nWhat would really \u201csuck\u201d is if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy. https://t.co/rI0v55KKAi \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 1, 2019\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Facebook wants to launch a new currency that people could use to buy things on the social network and elsewhere, a so-called cryptocurrency.\n\nLitan told AP that Facebook can still easily launch Libra in countries that would welcome it, and challenged the notion that Facebook needed partners like Visa and MasterCard to run Libra.\n\n\u201cThe only reason they want the companies is because it looks good,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was never a democratic blockchain. It was always run by Facebook and a couple of financial companies that were going along for the ride.\u201d\n\nStill, when Facebook announced Libra in June, the company said it looked to grow membership from the 27 announced companies to more than 100 in 2020, the planned year for the Libra launch. Instead, notes ArsTechnica, the association's membership has now fallen to 22 companies.\n\nNetherlands-based payment company PayU is still in the consortium.\n\n\u201cWe are focused on moving forward and continuing to build a strong association of some of the world\u2019s leading enterprises, social impact organizations and other stakeholders,\u201d Facebook said, in a statement to Reuters.\n\n\u201cAlthough the makeup of the Association members may grow and change over time, the design principle of Libra\u2019s governance and technology, along with the open nature of this project ensures the Libra payment network will remain resilient.\u201d\n\nContributing: Associated Press\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham (@jeffersongraham) on Twitter\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/10/13/visa-mastercard-ebay-and-others-drop-out-facebooks-libra-project/3968804002/", "description": "The alternative currency plan proposed by Facebook could still launch, but the road to get there has just gotten way harder, according to analysts.", "authors": ["Jefferson Graham", "Published P.M.
