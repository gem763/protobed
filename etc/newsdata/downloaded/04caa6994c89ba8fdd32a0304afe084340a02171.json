Photo: Thom Browne\n\nFashion designer Thom Browne is launching a collection of six gender-neutral fragrances next month, all of which are vetiver based. I can die now.\n\nEarthy, grassy, crisp vetiver is hardly the most popular fragrance note. Traditionally, it has been used mostly in men\u2019s scents, but it has a timeless elegance that\u2019s much like one of Browne\u2019s iconic gray flannel suits \u2014 made to be worn by everyone. The designer seems to agree. He told WWD that he chose vetiver (which he spells vetyver. Maybe it\u2019s how the Brits spell it?) \u201cbecause it is an iconic scent which served as a good base for my fragrance collection. I do appreciate fragrances that confidently and unabashedly stand on their own, fragrances that provoke a true emotion.\u201d\n\nEach scent, which he created with fragrance house Givaudan, contains an accord of not one, but three vetiver extracts. And, while five are paired with another note (as in Vetyver and Cucumber or Vetyver and Rose), Vetyver Absolute stands alone and serves as the base for the others. (It is also Browne\u2019s personal favorite.)\n\nThe fragrances are all named after his date of birth. Photo: Thom Browne\n\nThe collection is so close to Browne\u2019s heart that he named all six of them after his date of birth \u2014 09.27.65 \u2014 each differentiated only by a number, 01 through 06. They range from $200 to $250 and will be sold in his boutiques, on thombrowne.com, and at Dover Street Market.", "description": "Fashion designer Thom Browne is launching a collection of six gender-neutral fragrances next month.
