But he has been growing increasingly concerned about the impact that low rates are having on the commercial property sector, and these worries have been exacerbated by the business models of WeWork and others like it.\n\nRecession fears\n\nRosengren\u2019s worry is two-fold.\n\nFirstly, co-working companies enter into long-term leases with property owners and then re-lease space on a short-term basis to firms that are typically smaller and less mature.\n\nIn a recession, it is these smaller firms that will hit the skids fastest. \u201cThus, in a downturn the co-working company would be exposed to the loss of tenant income, which puts both them and the property owner at risk if they cannot make lease payments to the owner of the building,\u201d Rosengren said.\n\n(This echoes concerns expressed locally last week by Michael Cook, group executive for property at Investa, who said there were inherent risks for landlords leasing out large chunks of space to co-working groups that had never been tested by a recession.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecondly, some of the co-working companies are using special purpose entities for leases; these can allow the WeWorks of the world to walk away from unprofitable properties in a downturn.\n\nRosengren brings all this directly back to low rates and what he describes as the \u201creach for yield\u201d.\n\nIn a low interest rate environment, a property owner is hungry for higher rents, and so is more willing to take on the added risk of leasing space to a co-working space with lots of SME tenants, and even do so through one of these special purpose entities.\n\nBut as Rosengren points out, the potential costs of such a move \u201care apparent only when a downturn occurs\u201d.\n\nBoston Federal Reserve president Eric Rosengren is worried about how commercial property fares in the next US recession. Bloomberg\n\n\u201cSimply put, I am concerned that commercial real estate losses will be larger in the next downturn because of this growing feature of the real estate market, which could ultimately make runs and vacancies more likely due to this new leasing model.\u201d\n\nIt seems Rosengren's point on the risks created by reaching for yield in a low rate environment extend to other parts of the WeWork story.\n\nHow is it that investors are willing to put a $US47 billion valuation on a real estate company that is trying to match long-term and short-term leases, and masquerading as a tech company?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy it is that such huge chunks of money are flowing into alternatives managed by the likes of SoftBank?\n\nInvestors are always prepared to take risks to back the next big thing. And in the start-up world, recent history says the pay-offs can be huge. But in a world of persistently low rates, a greater number of investors do seem willing to take on even bigger risks.\n\nRosengren\u2019s specific and general warnings are timely. WeWork\u2019s IPO might have been shelved, but the co-working boom is far from over and the reach for yield is only just getting started.", "description": "The story of WeWork's rise and fall is a parable about low interest rates and what one central banker calls the \"reach for yield\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2648%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d1ca77a31a268714a3390f01e260440744f8d68c", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
