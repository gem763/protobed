Makani hopes to create electricity to power communities across the world.\n\nDespite a growing number of wind farms in the United States and the potential of this energy source, only 6% of the world's electricity comes from wind due to the the difficulty of setting up and maintaining turbines, according to the World Wind Energy Association.\n\nMakani's energy kite launches from a floating platform in the North Sea off the coast of Norway.\n\nWhen the company's co-founders, who were fond of kiteboarding, realized deep-sea winds were largely untapped, they sought to make that energy more accessible. So they built an autonomous kite, which looks like an airplane tethered to a base, to install on a floating platform in water. Tests are currently underway off the coast of Norway.\n\n\"There are many areas around the world that really don't have a good resource for renewable power but do have offshore wind resources,\" Makani CEO Fort Felker told Rachel Crane, CNN's innovation correspondent. \"Our lightweight kites create the possibility that we could tap that resource very economically and bring renewable power to hundreds of millions of people.\"\n\nRead More", "description": "", "authors": ["Ahiza Garcia", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190925131356-01-makani-wind-energy-kites-electricity-mission-ahead-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
