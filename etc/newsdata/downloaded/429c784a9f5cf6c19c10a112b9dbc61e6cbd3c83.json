After splitting with her husband, Liam Hemsworth, the singer was linked to Kaitlynn Carter, who was going through her own breakup with husband, Brody Jenner. After a couple months where Cyrus and Carter seemed nearly inseparable, the two have called it quits, determining that they\u2019re better off as friends.\n\n\u201cMiley and Kaitlynn are no longer together romantically. They have been there for each other through tough times recently but decided it's best to be friends,\u201d a source told ET.\n\nCyrus and Carter were first seen together on a vacation to Italy last month, where they were photographed cuddling and kissing. Those photos reportedly caused Hemsworth to go ahead and file for divorce.\n\n\u201cHe thought they could work it out, but all those pictures of her and Kaitlynn ended that,\u201d a source told Us Weekly last month. \u201cLiam comes from a very conservative family and his family was freaked out by it.\u201d\n\nCyrus had reportedly been hoping to take some time from Hemsworth, but had not completely ruled out a reconciliation.\n\n\u201cMiley was asking for a break and wanted to soul search and came to the realization she was unhappy,\u201d a source told ET after their split was announced. \u201cMiley's parents have been supportive. They just want her to be happy.\u201d\n\nCyrus went on to perform at the iHeartRadio Music Festival in Las Vegas on Saturday night after the news of her breakup with Carter was announced. The split doesn\u2019t necessarily mean there will be no more photos of them together, though, as the two decided to remain friends.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been friends forever and were there for each other when they were both getting separated,\u201d a source told People. \u201cBut they\u2019re just not in a romantic relationship anymore.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "It\u2019s been a tough summer for Miley Cyrus.", "authors": ["Erika Harwood"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mlcVHZWBvMbnzNsfY.PucA--~B/aD0xMjc3O3c9MjU0NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_570/2c8982e2b32e4be2d121bb73a755f9b5", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
