If you know where they are or have any information about their whereabouts I need you to call my team.\u201d\n\nRonan Hughes also goes by the name Rowan, Essex police said.\n\nHooper said support from the community would be vital to help bring those responsible to justice and urged people to contact police with \u201ceven the smallest detail\u201d.\n\nThe lorry driver Maurice Robinson, 25, known as Mo, appeared in Chelmsford magistrates court by video link on Monday morning accused of the manslaughter of the eight women and 31 men. Their bodies were found in the trailer attached to Robinson\u2019s Scania cab in an industrial park in Grays in the early hours of 23 October.\n\nHe was also charged with one count of conspiracy to facilitate human trafficking, one count of conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration between 1 December 2018 and 24 October this year, and two counts of money laundering. He was not asked to indicate a plea.\n\nThree other people \u2013 a 38 year-old man, a 38 year-old woman, and a 46 year-old man \u2013 were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people, and were all bailed on Sunday.\n\nWork to identify the victims is continuing. There has been no confirmation of their nationality but many families in Vietnam fear their loved ones may be among the dead.", "description": "Ronan and Christopher Hughes wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking", "authors": ["Haroon Siddique"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd0b8088ab1fad530b27267aafcd16d792b3f0e1/0_30_1147_688/master/1147.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5021bb40fbd34a9d0de87a3f0be3ccde", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
