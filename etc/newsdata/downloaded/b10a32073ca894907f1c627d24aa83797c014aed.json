We\u2019ve been warning everyone for years about the advent of Artificial Intelligence, killer robots and they dystopian future that awaits us once our technology wakes up and takes control. As it turns out, BoJo thinks about these things all the time too.\n\nIf\u2019 you\u2019ve never gotten the chance to listen to Johnson Give a speech, don\u2019t miss the supercut from The Guardian below. They\u2019ve culled out two minutes of the best bits, where the PM warns the world about the internet of things, Alexa running your lives, nanorobots living in your bodies and, yes\u2026 terrifying limbless chickens. All of this awaits us if we don\u2019t keep an eye on what companies like Google and Amazon are up to. (Associated Press)\n\nThings the beleaguered British prime minister said in his astonishing speech to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday night: \u201cPink-eyed Terminators from the future.\u201d \u2033Terrifying limbless chickens.\u201d \u2033Your fridge will beep for more cheese.\u201d \u2026 Many didn\u2019t know what to expect Tuesday after the court ruling came down hours before Johnson\u2019s inaugural U.N. General Assembly speech as prime minister. But it\u2019s safe to say few anticipated what he dramatically and energetically delivered: a caffeinated screed about the damage that technology can do if misused \u2014 and the glories it can hand humanity if it is delivered properly.\n\nHere\u2019s the video. It\u2019s really worth the click, trust me.\n\nJohnson is always an entertaining speaker. If you Google Boris Johnson greatest quotes you\u2019ll find a goldmine of memorable one liners. But even knowing how eccentric he can be at the podium, I didn\u2019t see the \u201cterrifying limbless chickens\u201d line coming.\n\nStill, BoJo may be on to something here. We don\u2019t have to go so far as the terrifying killer robots of Boston Dynamics to find areas for concern. Google\u2019s algorithms are getting smarter all the time and worming their way into all aspects of society. For just one example, it was only this week that McDonalds announced that you can now use either the Google Assistant or Amazon\u2019s Alexa to apply for a job at the fast food chain. Just tell your phone or home-based device, \u201cHelp me find a job at McDonalds\u201d and it will launch you into a process of landing an interview. After each question you answer it plays the \u201cI\u2019m loving it\u201d jingle.\n\nBut what else will your digital servants be telling your prospective employer? Will it send along a greatest hits compliation of your dodgy tweets and Facebook posts? Perhaps it will forward a list of what porn sites you\u2019ve been visiting or how often you go to the doctor. Imagine the possibilities.\n\nThe future is here, folks. And it\u2019s inspiring and terrifying all at the same time. Boris Johnson knows this and he\u2019s trying to warn the world. So don\u2019t blame him when your refrigerator produces a limbless chicken for your dinner.", "description": "The robots are coming for you", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BoJoUN.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
