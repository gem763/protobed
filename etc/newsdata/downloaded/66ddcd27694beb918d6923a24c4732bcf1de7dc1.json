They jumped up to smash overhead surveillance cameras, used hammers to knock ticket sensors off gates and spray-painted and broke the screens of ticket machines, using umbrellas to shield their identities.\n\nRiot police arrived following the attack and guarded the station after it was closed, with a metal grille pulled down to block entry.\n\nProtesters then built a barricade across a street near the mall, piled what appeared to be brown palm fronds on top and set them on fire.\n\nRiot police fire teargas at Hong Kong protesters as unrest escalates Read more\n\nPolice fired teargas as they tried to advance on the protesters, who had retreated before taking a position behind a wall of umbrellas held by those in the front.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protests, now in their fourth month, have often descended into violence late in the day and at night. A hard core of protesters say extreme actions are needed to get the government\u2019s attention. On Saturday night, police used teargas and rubber rounds against protesters, who threw petrol bombs towards them and set fires in the streets.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A child arranges origami cranes in the pro-democracy rally at a Sha Tin shopping mall on Sunday.

Many lined the balustrades of the three higher floors overlooking the crowd gathered in the wide space below.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, has agreed to withdraw the extradition bill that sparked the protests in June. But the anti-government protesters are pressing other demands, including fully democratic elections in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory and an independent investigation of complaints about police violence during earlier demonstrations.\n\nProtesters say Beijing and Lam\u2019s government are eroding the \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d and western-style civil liberties promised to the former British colony when it was returned to China in 1997.\n\nThe unending protests are an embarrassment for China\u2019s Communist party ahead of the 1 October celebrations of its 70th year in power. Hong Kong\u2019s government has cancelled a firework display that day, citing concern for public safety.\n\nTransit authorities closed two stations on the airport express train to guard against possible disruptions, but none had materialised by late Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe Hong Kong International Airport Authority said the train would operate between the airport and the terminus station in the city centre without making its usual stops in between. Some airport bus routes were also suspended.\n\nPassengers were advised to leave sufficient time to reach the airport and people on the train were told via onboard announcements that it would make fewer stops than usual, with no mention of the protests. Orange tape blocked the turnstiles at the empty Kowloon station and police clutching riot helmets greeted arriving passengers at the Hong Kong terminus.", "description": "Police fire teargas at protesters after they deface a Chinese flag, set fires and vandalise a station", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6121330a468e79248ee630e05296021d59d64164/16_121_3461_2077/master/3461.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c5362fc7ffdb139563d6f6eac52a2e92", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
