Government officials who believe that \u201care extremely out of touch,\u201d he added. The protests have dramatically expanded in scope and ferocity since they began in the spring, with frequent clashes between demonstrators and police. More than 1,400 people have been arrested since June. Lam\u2019s decision, which also included beefing up the city\u2019s police oversight board, was met with hostility. The slogan \u201cfive demands, not one less\u201d lit up the messaging apps and forums where rallies are organized. Demonstrations have continued unabated since Lam\u2019s concessions with even more planned as October 1, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, draws near.\n\n\u201cStudents are very angry,\u201d Siu told me, as we sat in a coffee shop earlier this month. \u201cEverybody in Hong Kong is very angry.\u201d We met a day before a mass rally to mark the start of a two-week class boycott across universities in Hong Kong. She spoke with sustained intensity for nearly an hour, her phone untouched, a notable achievement as a protest at Hong Kong\u2019s airport was growing and updates on demonstrations ping across messaging apps almost constantly. Dressed entirely in black, the uniform of this summer\u2019s protests, the 20-year-old had pinned a violet-colored ribbon to her T-shirt in a show of solidarity with a female protester who alleged that she was put through a humiliating strip search by police after being arrested at a demonstration. Police, the focus of much of the protesters\u2019 ire in recent weeks, have denied any wrongdoing in the incident and have rejected accusations of inappropriate use of force.\n\nSiu first took part in Hong Kong\u2019s protests in 2014, when the Umbrella Movement called for comprehensive universal suffrage here. She watched as the government refused to budge, then set about exacting a measure of revenge\u2014relentlessly pursuing protest leaders through the courts and disqualifying those who stood in elections. Her beliefs, she explained, shifted in the years that followed from more moderate positions to advocating for Hong Kong\u2019s independence from China. As her political views evolved, so did her thoughts on protest methods. \u201cI realized that peaceful demonstrations and protests might not be the way out,\u201d she said.\n\nWhereas the Umbrella Movement was characterized by a largely peaceful occupation of thoroughfares in Hong Kong, these latest rallies have been more aggressive, on the part of both police and protesters, including students. Siu and the City University students\u2019 union help connect arrested students with lawyers, and the night before our meeting had been particularly busy. Scores of people were arrested when police stormed a subway station before charging into a train car, beating commuters and protesters seemingly at random. Among those grabbed by police was the president of another university\u2019s student union.", "description": "Students are once again at the heart of the city\u2019s protests.
