Ron Wyden, D-Oregon.\n\nDrawing on contemporaneous emails and private interviews, an 18-month probe by the Senate Finance Committee's Democratic staff found that the NRA underwrote political access for Russian nationals Maria Butina and Alexander Torshin more than previously known \u2014 even though the two had declared their ties to the Kremlin.\n\nThe report, available here, also describes how closely the gun rights group was involved with organizing a 2015 visit by some of its leaders to Moscow.\n\nThen-NRA vice president Pete Brownell, who would later become NRA president, was enticed to visit Russia with the promise of personal business opportunities \u2014 and the NRA covered a portion of the trip's costs.\n\nThe conclusions of the Senate investigation could have legal implications for the NRA, Wyden says.\n\nTax-exempt organizations are barred from using funds for the personal benefit of its officials, or for actions significantly outside their stated missions. The revelations in the Senate report raise questions about whether the NRA could face civil penalties or the loss of its tax-exempt status.\n\nAttorneys general in the state of New York and the District of Columbia are also conducting separate probes into alleged wrongdoing at the gun rights organization. These probes have a broader scope than the Senate report, which focuses on Russia.\n\nKremlin links were clear\n\nThe 77-page Senate report centers on Butina \u2014 a convicted Russian agent now in federal prison \u2014 and Torshin, a former Russian government official who is now sanctioned by the United States.\n\nThe report indicates that top NRA officials were aware of Butina and Torshin's links with the Kremlin even as they sought to work more closely together under the banner of gun rights.\n\nIn an email later circulated to two senior NRA staff members, Butina wrote that a purpose of the 2015 Moscow trip was that \"many powerful figures in the Kremlin are counting on Torshin to prove his American connections\" by showing he could bring prominent NRA officials to Russia.\n\nAt another point, Butina suggested to participants on the 2015 NRA trip to Russia that she might be able to set up a meeting between them and President Vladimir Putin, referring to him as \"Russia's highest leader.\"\n\nNRA facilitated political access\n\nDespite these declarations about their ties to the Russian government, NRA officials paid for and facilitated Torshin and Butina's introduction into American political organizations.\n\nButina and Torshin received access to Republican party officials at NRA events.\n\nIt was a explicit interest expressed by Butina: in one 2015 email to an NRA employee, Butina wrote, \"is there a list of U.S. governors or members of Congress that might be present at some time during the [NRA] annual meeting?\"\n\nThe employee responded with a list.\n\nThe NRA also helped them forge connections with other groups such as the Council for National Policy, the National Prayer Breakfast, the National Sporting Goods Wholesalers Association and Safari Club International.\n\n\"NRA resources appear to have been used to pay for membership and registration fees to third party events for [Torshin and Butina] as well as to arrange for transit to and lodging for many of those events throughout 2015 and 2016,\" the report states.\n\nReport contradicts NRA denials\n\nThe Senate report notes that in 2018, then-NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch repeatedly denied that the group leaders' 2015 trip to Moscow was sanctioned by the gun rights group.\n\nBut in a letter obtained by the committee, then-NRA President Alan Cors wrote to Torshin on NRA letterhead after consulting with NRA staff and former NRA President David Keene.\n\nCors designated two NRA figures to lead the trip: \"Dave Keene and [top NRA donor] Joe Gregory will represent the NRA and our five million members better than anyone else,\" he wrote.\n\nDuring the course of the investigation, Brownell's lawyer also told the committee that Brownell believed the trip to be an official NRA event.\n\nThis view is further strengthened by the committee's evidence that NRA staff prepared itineraries, gathered briefing materials, applied for tourist visas, paid for some of the travel expenses, and provided the delegation with NRA gifts to give to Russian officials.\n\nThe Senate investigation also found evidence that the NRA tried to hide various payments related to the trip.\n\nBrownell covered approximately $21,000 in expenses related to the trip; in June 2016, the NRA reimbursed Brownell just over $21,000.\n\nAfter questions were raised about the trip in 2018, Brownell paid the NRA $17,000 \u2014 a transaction that Brownell's lawyer told the committee was requested by the NRA as a way of \"getting the trip off the NRA's books.\"\n\nNRA leaders sought business opportunities\n\nThe Senate investigation concludes that a number of NRA figures on the 2015 trip traveled to Russia \"primarily or solely for the purpose of advancing personal business interests, rather than advancing the NRA's tax-exempt purpose.\"\n\nBrownell, then a vice president of the NRA, is the CEO of a major firearms supplier bearing his last name.\n\nIn an email to a staffer at his business, Brownell described his trip as \"an opportunity to be hosted in Russia to broaden our business opportunities ... to introduce our company to the governing individuals throughout Russia.\"\n\n\"The NRA directly facilitated Brownell's effort to travel to Moscow early to explore business opportunities with Russian weapons manufacturers,\" the report concludes.\n\nAnother member of the trip, NRA donor and then-Outdoor Channel CEO Jim Liberatore, told the Senate committee through his lawyer that his participation in the 2015 Moscow trip was \"purely commercial.\"\n\nWyden seeks IRS probe\n\nWyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said at the conclusion of his investigation that his staff had revealed information that shows that the National Rifle Association may have abused its tax-exempt status.\n\nThe next step, he says, is for the IRS to launch its own inquiry.\n\n\"The totality of evidence uncovered during my investigation, as well as the mounting evidence of rampant self-dealing, indicate the NRA may have violated tax laws,\" Wyden said. \"The IRS needs to examine these findings and investigate other publicly reported incidents of potential lawbreaking.\"", "description": "Emails and interviews detail the extent to which the National Rifle Association helped two of Moscow's agents ahead of the election, Senate Finance Committee Democrats say.", "authors": ["Tim Mak"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/27/ap_19117549787994_wide-1fa04f33316ecaf5aa87441051006daf617a0f38.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
