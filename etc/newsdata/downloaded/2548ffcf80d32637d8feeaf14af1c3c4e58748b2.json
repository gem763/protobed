Everyone loved her boundless energy and positivity so much that I invited her back every year. So, our friendship grew,\u201d says Stan.\n\nHe says Poppie has become very close to the cycling family, and himself, and he wanted to help her get a lifetime opportunity of not just boarding a flight or visiting a foreign country for the first time, but to document her story and make it an inspiration for others. Stan\u2019s girlfriend, Donnet Dumas (32) will be filming the documentary throughout Poppie\u2019s journey.\n\n\u201cPoppie has never left the Western Cape and this once-in-a-lifetime trip will change her life forever. It will alter her world-view. Perhaps this opportunity will inspire her peers and those around her small community to better their own lives too. It\u2019s heart-breaking to travel through these Karoo towns and see people living with no hope, no prospects,\u201d Stan says.\n\n\u201cPoppie\u2019s life story is fascinating \u2013 filled with humour and often sadness. And with this opportunity to go to Italy it has become clear that her story is begging to be told.\u201d\n\nHe says Poppie will receive half of all profits from the documentary and he will help her use the money wisely.\n\nAfter rallying together the public, Poppie has begun her journey and will be sharing the wonder of the beloved SA snack with the land of the Tuscan sun.\n\nThis video was shared of her on BackaBuddy\u2019s Facebook page of Poppie thanking everyone who has helped her raise the funds needed for this exciting opportunity:\n\nPoppie is on her way to Italy! With over R102 000 raised and many hearts captured, Tannie Poppie is finally making her way to Italy where she will prepare her famous 'roosterkoek' to new adoring fans! \ud83c\uddff\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9Well done, Tannie Poppie! Bon Voyage! \u2708\ufe0fhttps://www.backabuddy.co.za/poppie-van-as Posted by BackaBuddy on Wednesday, September 25, 2019\n\nHe says half of the funds raised is targeted to cover her visa application, travelling and getting her some basics for the trip.\n\nThe remainder of the money raised will go towards the documentary.\n\nPoppie\u2019s journey has already kicked off on a positive note as her seat on her first flight ever got bumped up to Business class.\n\nYou can follow Poppie\u2019s journey on her Instagram as she shared these snaps of her adventure thus far:\n\nSource: News24", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://heritage.24.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/heritage-logo-100x100.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
