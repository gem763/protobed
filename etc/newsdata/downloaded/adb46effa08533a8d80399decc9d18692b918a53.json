Janelle Bynum (D), left, stands with her daughter, Christine. Both say they have been the targets of racial profiling near Portland, Ore.\n\nWhen a mall security guard tapped on her car window, 17-year-old Christine Bynum didn\u2019t know what she and her two friends had done wrong. The Oregon teenagers had trekked back to Christine\u2019s silver 2004 Buick Century to brainstorm new Friday night plans after being turned away from an R-rated movie because one friend had forgotten her ID.\n\n\u201cWe were sitting in the car for no more than 20 minutes, when a very authoritative mall cop circled around the car,\u201d Christine told The Washington Post in a text message late Sunday evening. The girls, who are black, were drinking chocolate milk, eating Kit Kat bars and looking at homecoming dresses on Pinterest, she said.\n\nThe security guard told the girls the mall had \u201cvery strict policies for loitering,\u201d said Christine, an honor-roll student with a big smile and glasses. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even know what the word meant,\u201d Christine told her mother, Oregon state Rep. Janelle Bynum (D).\n\nThe girls knew the guard was asking them to leave, so they drove four miles to a local park to look up \u201cloitering\u201d on their phones.\n\n\u201cWe were confused and didn\u2019t feel that sitting in the car laughing and eating candy qualified as \u2018strictly prohibited\u2019 activity,\u201d she said. Christine said the girls saw other people waiting in their cars in the parking lot, and she was unsure why they were singled out.\n\nBy the time she got home and told her parents what had happened, Christine thought she knew why the teens had been kicked out of the mall in a suburb outside of Portland, Ore.\n\n\u201cShe believes she was racially profiled by a mall cop,\u201d her mom said on Facebook.\n\nOn Sunday, the state legislator took to social media to encourage people in her district to show up at the Clackamas Town Center mall for a \u201cloiter-in\u201d over the next week, suggesting that people should wait in the food court, sit on benches in the mall and scroll through their social media accounts in the parking lot.\n\n\u201cGo see how long it takes to be asked to leave the mall by mall security,\u201d Bynum wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s figure out if there\u2019s a difference between loitering or being the wrong color.\u201d\n\n\n\nChristine Bynum, 17, was hanging out with two friends at an Oregon mall when a security guard abruptly ordered the girls to leave. (Craig Mitchelldyer/Craig Mitchelldyer)\n\nThe general manager for the Clackamas Town Center did not immediately return a request for comment late Sunday evening. Bynum said the general manager had emailed her Saturday requesting to speak with her and Christine about the incident, but they have not yet met.\n\nThe alleged incident of racial profiling comes more than a year after Bynum, while campaigning door-to-door for reelection, had a woman call the local sheriff\u2019s office to report her as \u201csuspicious.\u201d The incident made national headlines as part of a pattern of white people calling police on black neighbors doing everyday tasks, from cutting grass and selling bottled water to napping in a dorm lounge and sitting in a Starbucks. The calls inspired the viral hashtag #LivingWhileBlack.\n\nAfter the Clackamas County Sheriff\u2019s Office interrupted her campaigning, Bynum, who is the only black person serving in the state House of Representatives, introduced a bill that allows the targets of racially-motivated 911 calls to sue in small claims court for $250. The bill passed in June and will go into effect in Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cI still have flashbacks to the campaigning event,\u201d Bynum told The Post in a statement. \u201cBehind my smile was a sense of just having to muscle through the pain so I could keep talking to neighbors that day. But the truth is, it is deeply insulting and emotionally draining to be accused of being a common criminal when I\u2019ve been a public servant, business owner, and am well-educated.\u201d\n\nIn court records, officers recently called the Clackamas Town Center parking lot a \u201ccommon spot for interstate drug deals,\u201d the Oregonian reported. But the drug busts at the mall have involved adults carrying massive loads of heroin and methamphetamine.\n\nA black woman who said she works at the mall as a hair stylist wrote on Facebook that she\u2019d had a similar experience to Christine while eating lunch in her car, as she often does during the workday.\n\n\u201cA security guard I\u2019d never seen before pulls up along side my car,\u201d Arjorie Arberry-Baribeault said. The guard rolled down his window and asked her if she was an employee, then drove away. \u201cI was taken a bit back because of how \u2018tough\u2019 he was coming off towards me,\u201d she added.\n\nRacial discrimination has been a perennial problem in Portland, Ore., which has been described as the whitest major city in the U.S. Despite that history, Christine said she was still shocked at her treatment by the security guard.\n\n\u201cNever in my life did I think I would be singled out by someone in my own community,\u201d Christine told The Post. \u201cI grew up at this mall, many could even call it my second home. Yet with an experience like this, knowing that we\u2019ve been called out because we looked different, it feels unsettling.\u201d", "description": "A black Oregon lawmaker's daughter was kicked out of a local mall for \"loitering.\" It's not the first time the family says it's faced racial profiling in the whitest major city in America.", "authors": ["Katie Shepherd", "Morning Mix Reporter", "September At Am", "Katie Shepherd Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
