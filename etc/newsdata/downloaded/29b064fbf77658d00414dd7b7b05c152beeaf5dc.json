The first was the Boston Red Sox with NESN in 2006, a trend continued when the Los Angeles Dodgers put all of their games on Time Warner (now Spectrum) SportsNet, and later when the Baltimore Orioles put theirs on MASN in 2018 after having been on WJZ for 64 years.\n\nWhen the Cubs announced that the team would create the Marquee Sports Network -- named after the classic red sign that has greeted fans at Wrigley Field, with a logo that mimics it as well -- they emphasized that it will be airing all of the team\u2019s games.\n\nThat means fans will no longer to be able to see games on free over-the-air channels WGN \u2013 which has had the Cubs for the past 72 years \u2013 and ABC 7, where they have aired since 2015.\n\n\u201cThe Cubs are just incredibly popular,\u201d said media consultant Brad Adgate. \u201cThey\u2019re like the Yankees in New York and the Dodgers in LA. The Cubs have a loyal following, even though they\u2019ve had a lot of lean years up until five years ago. It\u2019s really a very interesting question\u201d what the fan impact will be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Cubs and Sinclair Broadcasting Group will be asking $4 per month for Marquee, which will bring up what Chicago-area cable subscribers pay for regional sports networks to $13 a month.\n\n\u201cFour dollars (a month) is really kind of below the market price for a lot of regional sports networks,\u201d said Adgate. \u201cYou look at New York and LA, it seems to be kind of in line; it doesn\u2019t seem to be totally outrageous. It\u2019s outrageous for a cable network, per se, but for a regional sports network, that\u2019s pretty much in step with what they\u2019re charging in other markets.\"\n\nSinclair\u2019s partnering with the Cubs on Marquee is consistent with its recent activity in sports broadcasting. The company finalized its $9.6 billion purchase of 21 Regional Sports Networks from the Walt Disney Company on Friday, August, 23.\n\nThat marked the completion of a months-long transfer of the properties that were once owned by Fox and were part of Disney\u2019s $71.3 billion purchase of film and television properties from 21st Century Fox. Antitrust regulators required Disney to divest itself from the sports networks due to its ownership of sports media giant ESPN. Sinclair also recently closed on a separate deal with Amazon and the New York Yankees to purchase the YES Network from Disney.\n\n\u201cI would think they would sell a national package of Marquee with the other regional sports networks to national advertisers,\u201d Adgate says of Sinclair\u2019s role. \u201cBeing that Sinclair has other regional sports networks and they have huge over-the-air stations that are also getting retransmission fees, they do have some leverage.\"\n\nThe ability to reach a large audience \"is very important to compete and get good pricing that you want,\" he added. \"Having a big media company behind you is going to be very helpful, and that\u2019s what I think is going to help Marquee be pretty successful financially coming out of the launch\u201d in February 2020.\n\nTwo teams that have bucked the trend are New York\u2019s teams -- the Mets and Yankees -- which both have over 20 games on PIX 11.\n\n\"Our partnership with PIX11 provides SNY [SportsNet New York] and the Mets continuity with a long-term broadcast partner which does a great job promoting and distributing our games,\" said SNY President Steve Raab. \"25 games is meaningful to PIX11\u2019s schedule, while also allowing SNY to maintain its dominant position with Mets fans.\"\n\n\"You\u2019re going to get people who are angry that they have to pay to see the Cubs after seeing them on WGN for decades.\" Brad Adgate, Media Consultant\n\nThe Cubs\u2019 move to create its own sports network is essentially an effort to recoup the equity stake the team had when both it and WGN were owned by Tribune. That changed in 2011 when the Cubs were sold to a group led by Tom Ricketts, which still owns the team today and has made its mark on the franchise by renovating Wrigley Field and breaking a 108-year curse with a championship in 2016.\n\nAdgate wonders \u201cwhat took them so long\u201d to break away from WGN. \u201cIt was borrowed time on this. They have to be the only team that was actually available as widespread for the last 50 years. I think when you see all the ownership changes \u2013 when Tribune sold the Cubs and now they sold the station, it\u2019s now part of NexStar \u2013 the handwriting was on the wall.\"\n\nWGN broadcast Cubs games nationally until 2014, and its radio station\u2019s deal with the Cubs ended the season before.\n\n\u201cObviously, you\u2019re going to get people who are angry that they have to pay to see the Cubs after seeing them on WGN for decades and just may say, you know, 'I\u2019m not going to pay for this,' and they\u2019ll find some other way to spend their downtime,\" Adgate said. \"If you\u2019re a Cubs fan, and they\u2019re putting out a good product, I\u2019m sure you probably look at the four bucks and just cough it over.\u201d\n\nCLICK TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Teams have increasingly demanded games on their own networks and not on free over-the-air television.
