The best of the rest aimed below the belt\n\nSaturday Night Live kicks off its 45th season in the Oval Office. Facing impeachment and \u201cthe greatest presidential harassment of all time,\u201d Donald Trump (Alec Baldwin, putting to bed rumors he was done playing the role) sits up late and commiserates over the phone with his inner circle \u2013 blabbermouth Rudy Giuliani (Kate McKinnon), recalcitrant attorney general William Barr (Aidy Bryant), perfect fall guy Mike Pence (Beck Bennett), and his doofus sons (Mikey Day and Alex Moffat).\n\nLess Trump, more weirdness: how Saturday Night Live can fix itself Read more\n\nGrowing more desperate, he reaches out to various outlier allies, including Kim Jong-un (new featured player Bowen Yang), Fox News mouthpiece Jeanine Pirro (Cecily Strong) and his \u201curbans\u201d, Kanye West (Chris Redd) and Don King (Keenan Thompson), who, on behalf of the \u201cblack wackadoo\u201d contingent, have decided to drop their support. The sketch peters out after Trump calls Liev Schreiber, confusing him for the underworld fixer he plays on Showtime\u2019s Ray Donovan.\n\nSNL couldn\u2019t have picked a better week to come back, given the magnitude of the impeachment scandal and the bungles in the administration\u2019s response. Alas, they manage only a rote, rushed and utterly pointless cold open, as free of big laughs as it is of insight. When it comes to Trump, it appears we\u2019re in for a long season.\n\nSaturday Night Live - SNL (@nbcsnl) Got a problem that needs fixing?\n\nCall Ray Donovan. \u260e\ufe0f#SNLPremiere pic.twitter.com/YIB9ReNd3p\n\nZombieland star and self-described \u201cfashionista\u201d Woody Harrelson hosts for the fourth time. After stripping off his tuxedo to reveal silk pajamas, he delivers a rambling monologue overflowing with groaners such as \u201cI\u2019m Asian \u2026 Caucasian!\u201d I think the joke is supposed to be that he\u2019s high, but the whole thing is too muddled to tell.\n\nA CNN Impeachment Town Hall brings together the Democratic candidates to discuss this week\u2019s bombshell story \u201cthe only way they know how \u2013 with a muddled, 10-person debate.\u201d The hopeless candidates \u2013 Beto O\u2019Rourke, Andrew Yang, Corey Booker, Pete Buttigieg, an astral projecting Marianne Williamson \u2013 are summarily excused.\n\nThe moderator then pivots to \u201cthe actual candidates\u201d: energetic reformer Elizabeth Warren, cranky revolutionary Bernie Sanders (Larry David), familiar but out-of-touch Joe Biden (Harrelson, really looking the part), and America\u2019s \u201cfun aunt\u201d (or \u201cfunt\u201d) Kamala Harris (Maya Rudolph).\n\nAs is the case any time David shows up to play Sanders, he steals the show with his loveable curmudgeonry. But Harrelson and Rudolph match him, especially when sparring over Biden\u2019s ridiculous Corn Pop anecdote.\n\nWhile the satire isn\u2019t particularly cutting the laughs all land, thanks in large part to the cameoing guests. This should have been the cold open.\n\nSun\u2019s Out Nevada sees a local correspondent cover the grand opening of the World\u2019s Biggest Cheeto museum, only for the centerpiece to fall into a fan and blow up in a puff of orange dust. It\u2019s a long set-up for a merely decent payoff.\n\nTeen musical sensation Billie Eilish sings Bad Guy while dancing along the walls of a rotating set. It\u2019s an ambitious performance, reminiscent of the sci-fi mindbender Inception.\n\nSaturday Night Live - SNL (@nbcsnl) Lot of updates this weekend. #SNLPremiere pic.twitter.com/OyeKVZ0zjT\n\nWeekend Update returns, opening with the slow march to impeachment. Colin Jost is exasperated by Trump\u2019s reaction: \u201cIt\u2019s like if the cops asked you if you killed someone and instead of saying, \u2018No, I didn\u2019t,\u2019 you\u2019d said, \u2018Who told you that \u2013 Ron?\u201d Michael Che is annoyed by the length of the process: \u201cBeing president is only a four-year job but it feels like it\u2019s taking them five years to just fire his ass.\u201d\n\nThey welcome their first and oddly only guest, Big Papi, former Red Sox star David Ortiz (Thompson), who is recovering from a shooting in the Dominican Republic. He\u2019s staying positive, saying: \u201cWhatever doesn\u2019t kill you \u2026 makes you want to kill the person who tried to kill you\u201d. He then pitches his latest array of ridiculous sponsors, including HairBnB (\u201cYou need a wig for the weekend, use HairBnB\u201d) and Possible Burger (\u201cDid you buy a bunch of ground meat from the back of a pickup truck? It might not be real meat \u2026 but it\u2019s possible.\u201d).\n\nThere\u2019s a short second round of news stories, touching on a sexually tinged animal attack, white supremacist hand signals and Juul\u2019s recent troubles. If you were hoping the hosts (and co-head writers) might address or acknowledge the Shane Gillis controversy, you\u2019re out of luck though likely not surprised.\n\nA callback to a memorable sketch from Harrelson\u2019s last hosting gig, in 2014, Football Halftime Speech sees him playing a coach attempting to pep up his team, only to be interrupted by his new and much younger wife (Heidi Gardner), who asks if his \u201cthing\u201d is OK. After assuring her it\u2019s fine, he attempts to get back to his speech, but of course all the players want to know more about his gruesome penile issues which include a Daffy Duck sound and a vein that keeps popping out. The writers tends to over-rely on this format \u2013 a normal setting derailed by some absurd or disgusting line \u2013 but they remain a reliable vehicle for good gross-out humor.\n\nSNL drops Shane Gillis from cast over racist comments Read more\n\nInside the Beltway attempts to poke fun at the way media elites fool themselves into thinking the latest Trump scandal will be the one that brings him down, but the whole thing falls apart after a couple of snags during costume changes. That said, if you\u2019re a fan of cast members breaking, you\u2019ll get a kick out of it: Bryant utterly fails to keep cool.\n\nEilish returns and performs the acoustic ballad I Love You.\n\nThe show winds down with Dad, a precise parody of 90s rap videos, before closing out with an informercial for Chickhan\u2019s Apple Farm, a funny two-hander that makes good use of McKinnon and Bryant\u2019s chemistry. Harrelson throws out a shout out to climate activist Greta Thurnberg (whose face is plastered on his t-shirt) during an awkwardly long curtain call, closing a scattered premiere episode on a scattered note.", "description": "The 45th season began with a poor cold open and a rambling Woody Harrelson.
