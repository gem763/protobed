Firefighters said they made progress overnight in tackling the Kincade fire, which had burned 86 homes and charred an area more than twice the size of San Francisco.\n\nElectricity remained cut off to roughly half a million homes and businesses in northern and central California as a precaution by the state\u2019s largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E). Southern California Edison, which had previously made safety shutoffs and then restored power, cut power to 38,000 customers in the south of the state and warned that it could black out more than 300,000 customers, or about 600,000 people.\n\nFrustration mounts\n\nMore than 130,000 people remained under evacuation orders in northern California as firefighters continued to battle the Kincade fire.\n\nFrustration and anger mounted across the region as PG&E began the third round of sweeping blackouts in a week aimed at preventing its electrical equipment from being fouled by wind-whipped branches or toppling and sparking wildfires.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Firefighters tend to a structure lost during the Kincade fire east of Healdsburg, California, on 29 October.

The utility said on Wednesday it wouldn\u2019t proceed with some of the blackouts in the Bay Area. However, hundreds of thousands of people who had lost power over the weekend remained in the dark.\n\nPeople who weren\u2019t facing another day as fire refugees were worried about charging cellphones and electric vehicles, finding gasoline and cash, staying warm and keeping their food from spoiling.\n\nSome ended up at centers set up by PG&E where people could go to power their electronics and get free water, snacks, flashlights and solar lanterns.\n\nIn Placer county, Angel Smith relied on baby wipes and blankets to keep her 13-month-old son Liam warm and clean. The family has been without power since Saturday night and cannot draw well water without electricity.\n\nShe ran a cord from her neighbors\u2019 generator to keep her phone and tablet charged so the two could watch movies. Temperatures were expected to drop below freezing overnight in parts of northern California.\n\n\u201cThe hardest part about this for me has been making sure I keep my son warm as it gets cold here,\u201d Smith said.\n\nExtreme red flag warning\n\nOn Tuesday, the National Weather Service (NWS) had issued an \u201cextreme red flag warning\u201d for much of Los Angeles and Ventura counties, starting late Tuesday and into Thursday evening.\n\nCoupled with tinder-dry brush and low humidity, they could blow smoldering fires back to life and spread embers to start new blazes, authorities warned.\n\nOn Monday, thousands of people had been forced to evacuate because of a fire near the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. About 9,000 people, including Arnold Schwarzenegger and LeBron James, were remained under evacuation orders on Wednesday.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A destroyed home in Calistoga, California, on 28 October.

PG&E had shut off power to the area as part of planned shutoff, but the transmission lines remained energized.\n\nHas the climate crisis made California too dangerous to live in? | Bill McKibben Read more\n\nNo deaths were reported from the current fires but the wind gusts over the weekend may have claimed three lives. A 55-year-old homeless woman was crushed by a falling tree during high winds Sunday at a Santa Cruz campsite and a couple was killed the same day in a remote area of Madera county when a tree fell on their Jeep, which then crashed.\n\nPG&E criticized\n\nPG&E, which is in bankruptcy after its equipment was blamed for a string of disastrous fires over the past three years, including a blaze that all but destroyed the town of Paradise and killed 85 people, has said its foremost concern is public safety.\n\nBut California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, and top utility regulators have accused the company of mismanaging its power system and failing for decades to make the investments needed to ensure it\u2019s more durable. He and others have also complained that the utility has botched the outages by not keeping the public adequately informed.\n\nPG&E\u2019s president, Bill Johnson, said the utility has agreed to provide a \u201cone-time bill credit\u201d for people impacted by an 9 October power cutoff that affected about 2 million people. But he didn\u2019t confirm a figure, saying the mechanics had yet to be worked out.", "description": "Gusts topped 50mph in some areas before dawn as a new brushfire in Simi Valley prompted fresh evacuations", "authors": ["Guardian Staff", "Bill Mckibben"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a981dc240a2f28e026720301b8c93a8c68bac7d/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5fbec319b622c673e41b975310eb31e6", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
