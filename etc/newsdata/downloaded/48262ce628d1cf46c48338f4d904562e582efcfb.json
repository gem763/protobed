And as is his MO, the media-obsessed president has been fixated on not just the identity of the whistleblower behind the internal complaint that brought this scandal to the fore, but also on who, exactly, has been namelessly feeding intel to the press.\n\nIn the course of casual conversations with advisers and friends, President Trump has privately raised suspicions that a spiteful John Bolton, his notoriously hawkish former national security adviser, could be one of the sources behind the flood of leaks against him, three people familiar with the comments said. At one point, one of those sources recalled, Trump guessed that Bolton was behind one of the anonymous accounts that listed the former national security adviser as one of the top officials most disturbed by the Ukraine-related efforts of Trump and Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney who remains at the center of activities that spurred the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201c[Trump] was clearly implying [it, saying] something to the effect of, \u2018Oh, gee, I wonder who the source on that could be,\u2019\u201d this source said, referring to the president\u2019s speculation. Bolton, for his part, told The Daily Beast last month that allegations that he was a leaker in Trump\u2019s midst are \u201cflatly incorrect.\u201d\n\nThe former national security adviser\u2014who departed the administration last month on awful, mutually bitter terms\u2014is working on a book about his time serving Trump, and has \u201ca lot to dish,\u201d one knowledgeable source noted.\n\nNeither Bolton nor White House spokespeople provided comment for this story. Matt Schlapp, an influential conservative activist with close ties to the White House, said his assumption was that the leaks were coming from \u201ccareer folks inside who hate Trump\u201d and that the president and his campaign had \u201c14 months of this\u201d to come. As for Bolton, Schlapp said, \u201cHe\u2019s smarter than that, although he does aggressively defend himself.\u201d\n\nTrump has felt under siege from within before, including at various flashpoints of his presidency. For instance, near the end of the Mueller probe, the president became so distrustful and resentful toward Don McGahn, his own White House counsel at the time, he started asking those close to him, \u201cIs [Don] wearing a wire?\u201d\n\nBut the current sense that he has been undermined by people whom he brought into his orbit has come at a critical juncture and colored some of the decisions he has made since the whistleblower complaint became public. The president has openly declared that the whistleblower committed an act of treason. He has attempted to stop prominent advisers\u2014including his ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, a man who donated $1 million to his inauguration\u2014from testifying to Congress, only to apparently fail. On Monday, Fiona Hill, Trump\u2019s former top adviser on Russia and Europe, was on Capitol Hill, where she reportedly told lawmakers that Sondland and Giuliani circumvented the standard national security process on high-profile Ukraine matters. The president has struggled to add to his current legal team, and appeared to begin putting some distance between himself and Giuliani last week.\n\nAnd when outside allies began to talk about constructing a war room to help with impeachment, Trump shot down the concept, in part out of a sense that he couldn\u2019t rely on them to get the message out right. One top White House aide subsequently labeled the idea an exercise by \u201coutside peeps trying to self-aggrandize.\u201d\n\nThe impression left on Republicans is one of a president increasingly driven by paranoia and a desire for insularity\u2014and not, necessarily, to his own benefit.\n\n\u201cThere is a certain level of frustration that all the sudden the president says something, then Rudy does, and it is not always consistent. There is a frustration that not everybody knows what they should be doing. It is not that they can\u2019t defend the president it is a frustration that they don\u2019t know exactly how they are supposed to defend the president,\u201d said John Brabender, a longtime GOP consultant. \u201cFrom the president\u2019s perspective, this whole thing is a witch hunt and is outrageous and, therefore, it shouldn\u2019t even need explanation\u2026But with that said, you can\u2019t just be angry. You need a unified communications team.\u201d", "description": "Photo Illustration by Lyne Lucien/The Daily Beast/GettyAt a critical juncture in his presidency, facing a rapidly unfolding impeachment inquiry by House Democrats, Donald Trump is feeling besieged by snitches.In recent weeks, numerous leaks have appeared in the pages of The Washington Post, The New York", "authors": ["Asawin Suebsaeng", "Sam Stein"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dl8Gp3u4_a.GX_1dE.z70A--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/e9744621e3b390f8e83dcd79b0e6fff4", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
