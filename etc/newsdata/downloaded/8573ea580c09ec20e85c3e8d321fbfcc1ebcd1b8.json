A new film follows several women as they take to the road \u2013 with surprising and moving results\n\nAbout halfway through Saudi Women\u2019s Driving School, airing on HBO this week, the film looks as though it could be heading into a commercial break. Scenes in the sprawling, dust-cloaked capital of Riyadh give way to a magnificent desert ringed by sandstone plateaus. A single black Hyundai streaks through, trailing sand like a comet. In a scene worthy of a car ad, a woman, Shahad al-Humaizi, drives through the desert, sunglasses coolly in place.\n\nMaking Waves: behind a fascinating documentary about movie sound Read more\n\nNatural grandeur, woman at the wheel \u2013 it\u2019s not an image often associated with Saudi Arabia and one only state-sanctioned since June 2018, when the country\u2019s King Salman formally lifted a decades-long ban on female drivers. But Saudi Women\u2019s Driving School seeks to uncover stories like al-Humaizi\u2019s, which don\u2019t fit neatly into quick news hits, as more and more women take to the road.\n\nOn a state level, the removal of the female driving ban seems like a rare progressive fluke for a country whose brazen flexes of state control have drawn international outrage; five weeks before the ban\u2019s end, the film notes, at least 10 female activists who publicly called for the change were arrested and branded as traitors in the state press. Just months after the ban lifted, the brutal murder of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in a consulate in Istanbul, which a UN report blames on the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, drew widespread condemnation, as has the country\u2019s blockade on neighboring Yemen, spawning one of the worst humanitarian crises of the decade.\n\nStill, as Saudi Women\u2019s Driving School demonstrates, on a micro level, the end of the driving ban is no small event for numerous women in the country, offering new opportunities for employment, mobility and passion. \u201cI felt that having only known about Saudi Arabia through a lot of western media reports,\u201d director Erica Gornall told the Guardian, \u201cI wanted to go there on the ground and meet these women we\u2019d seen on the news.\u201d\n\nGornall, who has contributed to and directed several documentary projects for BBC2, joined the team behind Saudi Women\u2019s Driving School relatively late in the process, just weeks before they were due to depart for Riyadh. Producers Nick London and Fiona Stourton had secured a rare filming visa based on the narrow focus of their project, a process begun in the weeks after King Salman announced the ban\u2019s end in fall 2017.\n\nThe crew arrived in Saudi Arabia in mid-October 2018, and filmed on and off for three months. The team was, for the most part, surprisingly left to their own devices, said Gornall, although \u201cat the same time, there were other things that reminded you that film-making was very new, and a thing you have to be careful about.\u201d For example, she accidentally caused a scene by filming alone outside a crowded cafe. \u201cBut overall, it was a lot easier to film in Saudi Arabia than I thought it would be.\u201d\n\nThe central hub of filming was the titular Saudi Women\u2019s Driving School in Riyadh, a looping maze of new drivers and instructors in white cars, and the gateway to certification for aspiring female drivers. Gornall and her crew followed several women at different levels of driving ability. For some, like Sarah Saleh, who works on an auto showroom floor but was not able to drive, a license offered freedom of mobility and the chance to actually drive a product she sells. For women like race-car driver Amjad Alamri and Uber driver al-Humaizi, the ban\u2019s end translated into career opportunities.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sarah Saleh, the auto saleswoman who was unable to drive. Photograph: HBO\n\nAlamri, introduced to Gornall through a Saudi member of her film crew, began learning to drive long before the ban\u2019s end; now, she\u2019s a striking presence on the racetrack, inspecting her car, willing herself not to get too distracted on the turns. \u201cThe ambition after having so many barriers for years and years and being told no this isn\u2019t for you \u2013 she is one of those feminists who really is taking the bull by the horns,\u201d said Gornall.\n\nMeeting women such as Alamri and al-Humaizi was \u201cquite surprising\u201d, said Gornall. \u201cThere was quite a rebellious streak to some of the women we met.\u201d\n\nBut that rebelliousness bumps into opposition beyond the high walls of the state. Keeping to the film\u2019s small-scale focus, Saudi Women\u2019s Driving School visits the issue of driving, and women\u2019s rights at large, in individual conversations and family discussions. In one of the most striking scenes of the film, al-Humaizi picks up a random male passenger in her Uber who has never ridden with a female driver before. She broaches the topic of women\u2019s rights casually but firmly, with a smile. Does he support the changes? she asks. He answers confidently yes, to a point; he\u2019s not opposed to equality but afraid of what might happen beyond that since \u201cwomen by nature are emotional\u201d.\n\nAl-Humaizi stares straight ahead, then drops him off at his destination. God bless, he says. \u201cI really enjoyed your driving, which I\u2019d been scared of.\u201d\n\nThe man was one of several anonymous participants Gornall and her crew picked up on street corners to ride in al-Humaizi\u2019s Uber or to discuss their thoughts on the driving ban \u2013 footage that was \u201cthe most frustrating bunch of interviews I\u2019ve ever had to do in my career to date\u201d, Gornall said.\n\n\u201cAs a film-maker, you try not to personalize it because it\u2019s not about me,\u201d Gornall said of the Uber scenes in particular. \u201cBut it\u2019s incredibly challenging not to because I\u2019m still a woman.\u201d The casual misogyny, stated confidently as simply a matter of course, \u201cmade me upset\u201d, said Gornall, \u201cnot for me, but for the women like Shahad, like Amjad, who were probably the strongest women I\u2019ve ever met in terms of their determination against everything that\u2019s happened in the past\u201d. To have people underestimate them, she said, was \u201creally frustrating\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Race car driver Amjad Alamri.

Guardianship was lifted in July 2019, though women must still seek permission for marriage.\n\nGornall said she was careful, however, not to underestimate the mettle of Saudi women. \u201cThe idea that they weren\u2019t driving [before the ban] \u2013 they were,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I found that quite amusing, but also quite refreshing.\u201d\n\nHowever, Gornall acknowledged, the reality is that breaking the rules in the autocratic country still often results in severe punishments. Loujain al-Hathloul, who drove before the ban\u2019s end and is shown in the film calling for greater rights for women, is still in prison. The film posits that Saleh\u2019s license, al-Humaizi\u2019s conversations as an Uber driver and Alamri\u2019s fearless presence on the track are all small steps of progress \u2013 achievements worth celebrating and perhaps indicative of a more liberated future for Saudi women. \u201cI want to be optimistic for the future of the women I filmed in Saudi,\u201d said Gornall. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s hard to see how those seeds will blossom further without bigger changes.\u201d", "description": "Last year, Saudi Arabia lifted its ban on female drivers.
