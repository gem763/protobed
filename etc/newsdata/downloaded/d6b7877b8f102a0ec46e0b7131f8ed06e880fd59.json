From its debut on Tuesday through National Coffee Day on Sunday, Sept. 29, Starbucks will equally distribute 15 cents from every purchase to the International Women\u2019s Coffee Alliance and Days for Girls, two organizations supporting women active in coffee origin communities within the company\u2019s supply chain.\n\n\u201cEvery aspect of this coffee\u2019s journey was touched by women \u2014 from sourcing, roasting and blending to the design on the bag. Siren\u2019s Blend tells a story of the impact women have at Starbucks and in the coffee industry at large,\u201d the company said in a blog post on its website.\n\nSiren\u2019s Blend will be available year-round at Starbucks stores in whole-bean, 16-ounce bags.
