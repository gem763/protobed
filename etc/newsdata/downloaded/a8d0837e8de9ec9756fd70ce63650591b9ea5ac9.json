Biden is taking incoming fire from the left after his campaign suggested he would drop his opposition to accepting outside financial help from a super PAC in his 2020 bid for the White House.\n\nSen. Bernard Sanders on Thursday said he doesn\u2019t need that kind of support for his own bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need a super PAC. I am not going to be controlled by a handful of wealthy people. I will be controlled by the working people of this country,\u201d the Vermont independent said at an event in Iowa.\n\nOn Thursday, the Biden campaign suggested that President Trump\u2019s financial prowess necessitates a shift from their previous position that they didn\u2019t want outside financial help from super PACs, which can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to support or oppose candidates.\n\n\u201cIn this time of crisis in our politics, it is not surprising that those who are dedicated to defeating Donald Trump are organizing in every way permitted by current law to bring an end to this disastrous presidency,\u201d said Kate Bedingfield, Mr. Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager and communications director. \u201cNothing changes unless we defeat Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, Mr. Biden had said he urged Mr. Sanders not to accept outside help from super PACs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the guy that told him, you shouldn\u2019t accept any money from a super PAC, because people can\u2019t possibly trust you,\u201d Mr. Biden said in an interview with PBS.\n\nBut on Thursday, Mr. Sanders said he didn\u2019t need convincing.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden didn\u2019t have to convince me not to start a super PAC,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren also denounced the use of super PACs on Thursday. She specifically referred to their use in the Democratic presidential primary contest and not necessarily a general election campaign.\n\n\u201cEvery Democratic candidate should agree: Super PACs have no place in our primary,\u201d Ms. Warren, Massachusetts Democrat, said on Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that any Democratic candidate would reverse course and endorse the use of unlimited contributions from the wealthy to run against fellow Democrats.\u201d\n\nThe Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a liberal group that has endorsed Ms. Warren in the race, also criticized Mr. Biden for the shift.\n\n\u201cIf Biden cares about defeating Trump, he should not open the door to billionaires and corporations flooding the primary and should make clear he does not want his supporters to use big money to attack other Democrats,\u201d said PCCC co-founder Adam Green.\n\nMr. Biden started October with less than $9 million on hand with just months to go until the Iowa caucuses in early February.\n\nMr. Sanders paced the 2020 Democratic presidential field with his $33.7 million war chest as of Oct. 1.\n\nMs. Warren was next with $25.7 million on hand, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, at $23.3 million and Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California at $10.5 million.\n\nBut Mr. Biden said he\u2019s not concerned about the money game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on a course to do extremely well. I\u2019m not worried about being able to fund this campaign. I really am not, truly,\u201d he said in an interview set to air Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
