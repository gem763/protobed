Nor would I try, she's absolutely gorgeous,\" he said.\n\n\"I thought I would look for love so I went on a dating website.\n\n(Image: Richard Swingler/Media Wales)\n\n\"We were chatting and one day I said I would come around for a cup of tea. Tea turned to a drink and another drink and I found myself pushing Rachel on the swings in the park at 3am!\n\n\"I took Rachel to Billericay a few years ago. She had never really left Barry before and the first thing Rachel experienced was Paddington station. We went to London and as soon as we got off at Paddington there was a bomb scare.\n\n\"It was the Friday before Christmas and Rachel has been to Cardiff on a rugby day so I thought I would take her to Oxford Street at 6pm. You couldn't see the pavement for people.\"\n\n(Image: Richard Swingler/Media Wales)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nIt was Rachel's first trip to London.\n\nShe said: \"I was born and bred in my beloved Barry and I don't want to live anywhere else.\n\n\"We fell in love straight away. We pretty much knew what we were looking for in eachother.\"\n\n(Image: Richard Swingler/Media Wales)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nBut Michael, a father-of-eight and grandfather-of-four, found himself homeless at 16.\n\nHe added: \"I was spending my first couple of months living in a Ford Capris on the estate and I found myself wondering the width and breath of the UK.\n\n\"It was the most difficult time but it taught me to survive. By the time I got here after all that drifting, I was seasoned around people. Some people go to prison to get that experience but I got it on the streets.\n\n\"I randomly drifted into Barry - I had been wandering around the UK for two years and thought there might be work on the holiday camp - and what I found was the people. They accepted me very very quickly. I fell in love with this town, the people were outstanding and I stayed. I grew roots.\n\n\"As a town it's got everything here, it's got a lovely seaside. You have the city of Cardiff with everything and you have the breathtaking countryside - and the people are lovely.\n\n(Image: Richard Swingler/Media Wales)\n\n\"I'm trying to encourage people to come to Barry. Half of my friends are from Billericay so when I post pictures of Barry maybe people can see and come visit.\"\n\nOn the subject of Gavin and Stacey, Michael admits he might have to give it a watch - but only after finishing his other series first.\n\nHe joked: \"We lived opposite the pub where they filmed the wedding. I saw a lot of buses go past with the Gavin and Stacey tour on the side and that's how I know about it. I kept asking 'who the hell was Gavin and Stacey?'\"\n\nRachel added: \"Sometimes he acts a little bit like Gavin, sometimes he acts a bit like Smithy.\"\n\nAnd who does Michael support in the rugby now?\n\n\"I've been in Barry longer than I was in Billericay. I've got this hybrid accent but I can go all Essex if I want,\" Michael admits.\n\n\"My heart is 100% Welsh but when it comes to rugby I keep my head down and my mouth shut. I don't say a word!\"\n\nThe sitcom returns for one-off special this Christmas.", "description": "Just like the title characters in BBC sitcom Gavin and Stacey, Michael came from Billericay, Essex, and Rachel grew up in Barry, south Wales", "authors": ["Robert Dalling", "Anna Lewis", "Image", "Richard Swingler Media Wales", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20719542.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MEDIA-WALES-Real-Life-Gavin-and-Stacey-01.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
