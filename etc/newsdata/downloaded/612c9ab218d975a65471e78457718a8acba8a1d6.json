USA TODAY\n\nHow will this year's World Series play out? Using the Dynasty League Baseball online simulation, USA TODAY Sports' Steve Gardner and DLB designer Mike Cieslinski will pre-play each game to provide some insight into the key matchups and strategy fans can expect to see in the Fall Classic.\n\nGame 5: Houston Astros at Washington Nationals\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Down to their final three outs against the unstoppable Gerrit Cole, things didn't look great for the Washington Nationals. But the one person in a Nats uniform who wasn't intimidated by Cole and his triple-digit fastball just so happened to be at the plate when it meant the most.\n\nJuan Soto slugged his second home run of the game off the Astros ace \u2014 a no-doubt 440-foot rocket to right field \u2014 to tie the game in the bottom of the ninth. And Adam Eaton came through with a game-winning RBI single in the 10th to give the Nationals an exhilarating 4-3 victory over the Houston Astros in Game 5 of USA TODAY's annual Simulated World Series.\n\nASTROS HAVE TAKEN CONTROL: 'We got our swagger back'\n\nBOX SCORE:Nationals 4, Astros 3 (10 innings)\n\nNationals left fielder Juan Soto (22) prepares to bat during the eighth inning against the Astros in Game 4.

But the Nationals got a first-inning home run from Anthony Rendon, a solo shot by Soto in the sixth and Soto's dramatic blast in the ninth to force extra innings.\n\nThe Astros only threatened once against Scherzer -- in the sixth -- when Carlos Correa doubled, Josh Reddick tripled and Martin Maldonado singled to give them a 2-1 lead. (Scherzer had to leave in the sixth with back spasms.)\n\nAfter Soto tied the game in the sixth, Houston took a 3-2 lead in the eighth on Michael Brantley's solo homer off Nats closer Daniel Hudson. But when the Astros chose to stick with Cole to start the ninth with Soto due up, the Nationals' young slugger made them pay.\n\nThe Nats began their winning rally in the 10th against hard-throwing righty Josh James when Cabrera drew a one-out walk and Trea Turner reached on a fielding error by first baseman Yuli Gurriel.\n\nEaton jumped on a first-pitch fastball and ripped it up the middle. Center fielder George Springer charged the ball and fired to the plate, but the throw was just a fraction of a second too late.\n\nPrevious Sim Series results\n\nGAME 1: Astros 4, Nationals 0\n\nGAME 2: Astros 10, Nationals 2\n\nGAME 3: Nationals 4, Astros 1\n\nGAME 4:Astros 5, Nationals 3\n\nWhat to watch in (the actual) Game 5\n\n\u2014 Leaning on everlasting arms: The biggest question for both managers with their best starting pitchers on the mound was how long to stick with their aces before going to the bullpen. Both pitchers tossed complete games when they faced each other in Game 1 of the Sim Series.\n\nBut that was when both teams were fully rested. Playing for the third time in as many days, both bullpens were taxed and the starters needed to go deep into the game.\n\nIn Houston's case, Cole was still throwing well into the ninth inning, retiring eight consecutive hitters after Soto's homer in the sixth. The Nationals' decision was essentially made for them when Scherzer's back flared up with two outs in the sixth inning.\n\n\u2014 Soto owns Cole? Armchair managers will no doubt take issue with Cole remaining in the game to face Soto a fourth time after he'd already singled, walked and homered against him in three previous plate appearances.\n\nRemember, Soto sent a Cole fastball onto the railroad tracks at Minute Maid Park in Game 1 of the actual World Series. That's almost exactly what happened in the bottom of the sixth inning of Sim Series Game 5 as Soto delivered a monstrous blast into the left-field seats.\n\nThe game-tying homer off Cole in the ninth was more reminiscent of Soto's blast off Clayton Kershaw in the NL Division Series, going 440 feet into the seats in deep right field.\n\nIn two Sim Series games vs. Cole, Soto went 5-for-6 with a walk, double and three homers. Everyone else on the Nationals vs. Cole: 5-for-54 (.093).\n\n\u2014 Fall-like conditions: The typical weather for late October in Washington calls for temperatures in the 50s, with some wind and rain thrown in. The simulation takes weather into consideration, and in Game 5, it did play a factor. The 17 mph wind blowing from left to right cut down on the distance of several fly balls that ended up dying near the warning track.\n\nNationals catcher Kurt Suzuki, in particular, had a deep blast to left fall short in the fourth inning. On a typical night with no wind and a temperature slightly higher than the 57 degrees at game time, Suzuki would have hit the Nationals' fourth homer of the game off Cole. The Astros' Carlos Correa had the same thing happen to him on a fly to deep center in the top of the sixth.\n\nThe chilly (and windy) weather could be yet another factor to favor a pitcher's duel between Cole and Scherzer.\n\nSimulate your own World Series.
