The country has the most overall number of billion-dollar private companies, however, taking the title from the U.S. for the first time. (The Logic)\n\nTalking point: China\u2019s sharp drop in unicorn generation coincides with a dip in venture capital spending in the country and record-low economic growth. The number of VC deals in the country in the third quarter of 2019 fell by about half to 702, the lowest since 2014, while growth slowed to its lowest rate since 1992. Economists have cited the U.S.-China trade war and Chinese companies\u2019 poor performances on the public markets as reasons for the drop in VC investment. The unicorn slowdown also comes as U.S. companies leave China.", "description": "", "authors": ["Catherine Mcintyre"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
