Under the proposed plan, House committees would continue to pursue probes of those issues.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi offered the suggestion during a leadership meeting on Wednesday morning, according to two people who attended the meeting, adding that national security should be a key focus.\n\n\u201cThis has clarity and understanding in the eyes of the American people,\u201d Pelosi told her leadership team, according to a source with knowledge of the meeting. \u201cIf we do articles, then we can include other things.\u201d\n\nAlthough there is no explicit deadline to act and no decisions have been made, some Democrats said they were hopeful articles of impeachment could be considered by the end of the year or even sooner.\n\nNew Window INTERACTIVE: See where House lawmakers stand on impeachment\n\n\u201cI think focusing on this Ukrainian scandal singularly is important,\u201d said Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) \u201cI think we have to act quickly. But not with haste.\u201d\n\nRep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) said the caucus has unified around the latest set of allegations because they are \u201cfundamentally different.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously, we are more able to speak with one voice on that subject than on some of the others,\u201d Kildee said of the House\u2019s slew of ongoing investigations. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the others go away, but I think this is clearly going to be the issue that\u2019s going to drive the bus.\u201d\n\nDemocratic leaders are continuing to discuss how to factor in the numerous other Trump-focused investigations that the House has launched, or set them aside in favor of more forcefully condemning Trump\u2019s July phone call with Zelensky.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer also privately discussed the possibility of focusing exclusively on Trump\u2019s interactions with Zelensky. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) echoed this strategy.\n\nThe intensifying impeachment fervor exploded Wednesday after the White House released a summary of Trump\u2019s July 25 call with the Ukrainian president that showed he explicitly sought a \u201cfavor\u201d: an investigation of Biden. By Wednesday afternoon, a majority of the House \u2014 217 Democrats plus independent Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan \u2014 was on record in support of formal impeachment proceedings.\n\nThe memo confirmed Democrats\u2019 strongest suspicions \u2014 that Trump pushed top Ukrainian officials to investigate his political rival while hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid was being held up. Trump also offered Zelensky Justice Department help in that investigation and emphasized his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani was acting as his emissary on the matter.\n\n\u201cThe release of the notes of the call by the White House confirms that the president engaged in behavior that undermines the integrity of our elections, the dignity of the office he holds and our national security,\" Pelosi said in a statement. \"The president has tried to make lawlessness a virtue in America and now is exporting it abroad.\"\n\nThere remains no firm timeline for the process of whether to recommend articles of impeachment to the full House. But top Democrats are already sounding off about Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelensky, dubbing Wednesday\u2019s revelation a smoking gun.\n\nNew Window How to read Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president: A line-by-line analysis of the conversation that launched an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cWhat those notes reflect is a classic mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader,\u201d House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said, accusing Trump of threatening to withhold military aid to Ukraine for political purposes. \u201cThis is how a mafia boss talks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not concerned whether it is a quid pro quo or not,\u201d Schiff added. \u201cUkraine understood what this president wanted. He made it abundantly clear. He made it redundantly clear. He had his emissaries making it clear. And Ukraine knew what it needed to do if it wanted to get military assistance: and that is, help the president of the United States violate his oath of office.\u201d\n\nDemocratic leaders emerged from closed-door meetings declaring that their impeachment inquiry was urgent. But multiple lawmakers, including Hoyer, confirmed that there was still no specific timeline, and that the House would not cut short its scheduled two-week recess.\n\n\u201cThe reality is, we want to move expeditiously, but there\u2019s no timeline. There\u2019s no, \u2018We gotta do something by X date,\u2019\u201d Hoyer told POLITICO. \u201cWe want to do it right. We want to do it expeditiously and right.\u201d\n\nTrump's call with Zelensky is just one piece of a whistleblower\u2019s complaint that the Trump administration has been withholding from Congress \u2014 a move that prompted Pelosi and dozens of House Democrats to call for formal impeachment proceedings on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe release of the memo is devastating for the president\u2019s defenders,\" said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a longtime impeachment advocate who sits on the Judiciary Committee.\n\nWhat the White House provided was not a verbatim transcript of Trump\u2019s call, though Democrats \u2014 and, in private, some Republicans \u2014 saw it as damaging enough.\n\n\u201cThis should shock the conscience of every American \u2014 and we still don\u2019t have the full story,\u201d said Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.), a member of the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees. \u201cThe administration continues to illegally withhold the full whistleblower complaint.\u201d\n\nBut the Trump administration finally relented on Wednesday, turning over the complaint to the House and Senate intelligence committees.\n\n\u201cI found the allegations deeply disturbing. I also found them very credible,\u201d Schiff told reporters after reading the whistleblower complaint, which remains classified. \u201cIt is an urgent matter. And there was simply no basis to keep this from the committee. The idea that DOJ would have intervened to prevent it from getting to Congress throws the leadership of that department further into ill-repute.\u201d\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3888/1155968404_6089163104001_6089162887001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nIn a statement, the Justice Department revealed that the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general cited a potential campaign finance violation related to the whistleblower complaint about the call. But the Justice Department ultimately concluded that no criminal activity occurred, according to Kerri Kupec, a department spokeswoman.\n\nNadler said Attorney General William Barr \u2014 based on his role in evaluating the Trump transcript \u2014 must recuse himself from any oversight of the matter.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s GOP allies were already jumping to his defense, with Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, saying: \u201cThere was no quid pro quo and nothing to justify the clamor House Democrats caused\u201d when they launched a formal impeachment inquiry. Collins' comments echoed a set of talking points the White House sent to congressional Republicans earlier in the day.\n\nEven without the complete substance of Trump\u2019s call, more than 200 members of the Democratic caucus \u2014 nearly enough to form a majority of the House \u2014 had embraced impeachment proceedings as of late Tuesday, citing Trump\u2019s refusal to provide the whistleblower complaint related to the phone call.\n\nLater Wednesday, the House took its first formal legislative action related to the Ukraine controversy when it voted on a non-binding resolution to disapprove the Trump administration\u2019s initial refusal to turn over the whistleblower complaint to the congressional intelligence committees. Republicans supported the resolution since they wanted the complaint turned over.\n\nDemocrats largely view that vote as a placeholder for its impeachment push ahead of a planned two-week House recess that starts Friday. The Senate passed a related measure on Tuesday demanding the whistleblower complaint be provided to Congress.\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

Andrew Bakaj, the whistleblower\u2019s attorney, has requested guidance from the DNI\u2019s general counsel regarding what his client can tell the committee.\n\nDemocrats held a full caucus meeting Wednesday morning as their leaders continued to hash out an impeachment strategy. Rank-and-file lawmakers were vexed at the lack of details about how to carry out Pelosi\u2019s call to action.\n\nRep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), a longtime impeachment supporter who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, said her panel would not be doing anything differently when it comes to its investigations, which center on potential financial crimes.\n\nPelosi\u2019s initial reluctance to provide a timetable for the completion of its inquiry led some lawmakers to question whether the new phase would be any different than the already-ongoing investigation being led by the House Judiciary Committee and supported by other congressional panels.\n\nThe White House\u2019s role in blocking the complaint \u2014 which was characterized as \u201curgent\u201d by an intelligence community watchdog \u2014 from reaching Congress motivated even Democrats in swing districts to come off the sidelines in favor of impeachment proceedings, citing urgent national security concerns.\n\nSarah Ferris, Heather Caygle, John Bresnahan and Zachary Warmbrodt contributed to this report", "description": "Lawmakers were outraged after seeing a White House readout of Trump's call, in which he urged the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Kyle Cheney", "Andrew Desiderio", "Heather Caygle"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c4/be/fd48f4d842a798d63056ef489608/20190925-pelosi-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
