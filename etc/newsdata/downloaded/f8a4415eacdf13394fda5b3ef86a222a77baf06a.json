Here's what's happening at the mega mall opening", "language": "en", "text": "Finally. It's open.\n\nFirst unveiled as a concept in 1991, reimagined, stalled and renamed numerous times over the three decades since, American Dream, the mega mall and entertainment complex that rises out of the Meadowlands marshes, opens its doors to the first customer Friday morning at 10 a.m.\n\nOnly a small portion of the complex actually opens today in East Rutherford, New Jersey. That would be the Nickelodeon Universe amusement park rides and a professional-sized ice rink.\n\nBut guests will have to wait until late November to check out the indoor water park; early December for the snow park; and March 2020 to shop and dine. Officials have described a string of opening celebrations as \"chapters.\"\n\nDriving to American Dream\n\nOn Friday, driving to the white-paneled behemoth was an exercise in confusion, with cars converging into a maze of unmarked roads and driveways.\n\nAs of 8:30 a.m., if you followed signs to the mall, you'd be met with cones blocking one of the entrances. Continuing on, you'd have to drive blind, as there are no visible signs that say how to enter the mall.\n\nHIGHWAY\u2019S JAMMED WITH BROKEN HEROES ON A..... wait, nope, nope, not even close,\n\nRoute 3 westbound 9:10 a.m. #AmericanDreampic.twitter.com/U2C1ALD50P \u2014 Scott Fallon (@NewsFallon) October 25, 2019\n\nThere is no fee to park on opening weekend, Friday Oct. 25 to Sunday, Oct. 27. But parking is a guessing game, with no signs indicating which lots or decks to use. There are no toll booths. There are no toll booth workers.\n\nNews vans arriving to cover the opening were directed to the wrong parking area due to incorrect signage. Patrol officers had to escort the vans to the correct parking.\n\nWith few visible signs telling visitors where to go, several cars were circling the American Dream's expansive property.\n\nPolice patrol cars and officers on bicycles were seen patrolling the property a little more than an hour ahead of the 10 a.m. scheduled opening.\n\nOne of the first visitors to the complex was Deborah Smith, 56, of Toms River, who had a little trouble finding her way in.\n\n\"I drove around five times to get in here,\" she said. \"This place ain\u2019t done with construction. It\u2019s odd that it\u2019s not done. Don\u2019t want building to fall on my head. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s tickets for the ice rink but we\u2019re gonna find out. Will this building fall on my head? That\u2019s an exaggeration but look at all this construction.\u201d\n\nMore: American Dream Nickelodeon Universe giant indoor theme park sells out for first weekend\n\nAmerican Dream: Under construction\n\nEven with less than an hour before doors were scheduled to swing open, the mega mall was an active construction site, littered with debris and equipment and full of construction workers continuing apace.\n\nWorkers in hard hats and neon vests were walking around the property as visitors started to trickle in. Unabated, the workers were directing people arriving at the mall, some who were there for continued construction work.\n\nOne of the bridges that visitors walk through to enter American Dream.

The panels appear to be so new that the smell still pervades the tunnel.\n\nAmong the first customers Friday morning were pals Zachary Santi, 24, and Justin Paleologos, 25, both from neighboring Lyndhurst who knew their way around the sports complex.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come here a number of times for sporting events and concerts at what used to be the IZOD stadium, so it wasn\u2019t that difficult to figure out where to park,\u201d said Paleologos, 25.\n\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe it\u2019s done,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember when I was just a kid and this whole thing was being started and thinking when is it going to get done, and now here we are.\u201d\n\nSanti said for as long as he can remember, he\u2019s seen the multi-colored structure while driving down Route 3.\n\n\u201cBefore it was a mish mosh of LEGO blocks\u2014 it was like a monument to Jersey\u2019s lack of building,\u201d Santi said. \u201cI woke up today like, wow, this is it, it\u2019s really happening.\u201d\n\nWhat's opening later this year\n\nSome retail experts say the mega center, developed by Canada\u2019s Triple Five, could serve as a North Star for the retail industry. Once fully operational, it will be a test case for experiential retail, and whether the concept can be successful in one of the country\u2019s most competitive markets.\n\nDreamWorks Water Park is slated to open the day before Thanksgiving. The indoor water park will feature more than 40 slides and 15 attractions. It will have the world's largest wave pool, the world's tallest indoor body slide, and an estimated 31 luxury cabanas designed by New Jersey native Jonathan Adler.\n\nJust one week after the water park debuts, on Dec. 5, American Dream's long-anticipated indoor snow park, called Big SNOW, is slated to open.\n\nThe 160-foot indoor ski slope, which has 5,500 tons of snow, is topped with a 26-degree incline, roughly equivalent to an intermediate ski run. It will feature banked turns on one side to mellow the initial grade for less experienced riders, and have a small terrain park.\n\nAmerican Dream will include Instagram-friendly settings where visitors can shoot selfies, including museum-scale interiors, a 60-foot fashion fountain and a sprawling garden with bird-filled aviaries and rabbit fields.\n\nThere will be miniature golf at American Dream. But not your run-of-the-mill course. The mega center will have Angry Birds Mini Golf \u2014 equipped with 3D renderings.\n\nThe New Jersey Hall of Fame, which never had a permanent home, will also move into American Dream.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/america/theme-parks/2019/10/25/american-dream-mega-mall-nickelodeon-amusement-park-open/2453966001/", "description": "The American Dream mega mall and entertainment complex in East Rutherford, first conceived in 1991, opened its doors Friday to the first customers.", "authors": ["Melanie Anzidei", "Published A.M.
