Absent such an explanation, it\u2019s too risky to bet that future Septembers will be like past ones.\n\nTo be sure, September\u2019s historical status as the worst U.S. stock market month is certainly secure. Not only is its average return the worst of any since the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.08% was created in the late 1800s (minus 1.0%, versus an average gain of 0.8% for all other months), its poor performance has been quite consistent. In all decades but one over the last century, September\u2019s performance rank was in the bottom half of the distribution.\n\nTo their credit, most financial advisers and other investment professionals recognize that a statistical pattern, even one as strong as September\u2019s, is an insufficient reason to bet on it. They know you should only bet on statistically strong patterns that have a compelling story.\n\nWhere investors go wrong is in thinking that September in fact has such a compelling story. Their search for justification has taken them on a wild goose chase. Reviewing their inane rationales provides a cautionary tale about how our critical faculties can easily be ignored when we\u2019ve already reached a conclusion.\n\nHere are just some of the explanations advisers have advanced for why September would be the worst month of the calendar for the stock market.\n\n1. Anxiety about third-quarter earnings\n\nThe rationale: The theory is that investors are more likely to sell stocks in September because they are nervous about third-quarter earnings, which will start coming out in October.\n\nThe flaw: : I thought this was a joke the first time I saw it; yet it has been suggested in all seriousness. What doesn\u2019t occur to those advancing this theory is that the same logic would apply to nervousness about first-, second- or fourth-quarter earnings. Yet March, June, and December returns are quite good, on average.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the quarter since 1988 with the worst EPS change over the prior quarter is the fourth. By the logic of this rationale, December should be the worst month of the calendar. In fact, over the three decades since 1988 it\u2019s been an above-average performer.\n\n2. \u2018Sell in May and go away\u2019\n\nThe rationale: Because of this six-month unfavorable pattern that lasts from May 1st to Halloween, an above-average number of stocks will be disappointing performers at the end of August. Yet traders who have been on summer vacation will have been oblivious of this, so when they return to work after Labor Day, they will sell stocks due to this surprising realization.\n\nThe flaw:: As I\u2019ve written elsewhere, the \u201cSell in May and go away\u201d pattern is based on just the third year of the U.S. presidential term. In the other three years of the presidential cycle, there is no statistically significant difference between the average May-through-October returns and those of the November-through-April periods. So if this rationale held water, Septembers in the third years of the presidential term should be worse performers than in the other three years. They\u2019re not.\n\n3. Pent-up selling pressure from the summer\n\nThe rationale: Because of summer vacations, traders haven\u2019t been selling the shares they otherwise have wanted to get rid of. But after Labor Day, all that pent-up selling pressure descends upon the market.\n\nThe flaw: I also thought this was a joke when I first saw it. Those advancing this rationale fail to see that the same logic could be used to justify September being the best month of the year \u2014 by arguing that traders over the summer will have postponed buying stocks they wanted to own, and this pent-up buying pressure hits the market right after Labor Day.\n\n4. Mutual-fund tax-loss selling\n\nThe rationale: Because most equity mutual funds have fiscal years that end Sep. 30, they\u2019ll engage in tax-loss selling in September to reduce or offset capital gains that they may have realized over the preceding year.\n\nThe flaw: This rationale\u2019s premise is false. More than three times as many stock funds have Dec. 31 fiscal-year ends as funds with fiscal years ending in September, according to data from fund researcher Lipper. If this rationale held any water, then December should perform worse than September. It doesn\u2019t, needless to say.\n\n5. Behavioral bias\n\nThe rationale: Investors have a behavioral bias that leads them to sell stocks at the end of the summer.\n\nThe flaw: This is not a rationale at all. To attribute September\u2019s poor record to a behavioral bias is to concede that you don\u2019t know why the month should be so bad for investors. In fact, this rationale is no more than a tautology: The rationale boils down to saying that investors disproportionately sell in September because investors are predisposed to sell in September.\n\nThe bottom line? In a roundabout way, September\u2019s terrible record can help us all become better investors. This won\u2019t happen by selling stocks at the end of August, or even going short, but by reminding us that we are prone to come up with explanations that may seem plausible but have no validity.\n\nMark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch.
