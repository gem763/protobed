Amazon\u2019s very expensive Lord of the Rings series has achieved a casting milestone by adding English actor Joseph Mawle, who officially became the first ex\u2013Game of Thrones star to join the adaptation. Per Deadline, Mawle (who played Benjen Stark in that other fantasy drama) is rumored to portray the show\u2019s lead villain, Oren, opposite previously confirmed stars Will Poulter and Markella Kavenagh. (Who are, respectively, also rumored to be playing Beldor and Tyra.) And \u2026 that\u2019s about all we know.
