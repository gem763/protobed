Here are a few things to consider before you make the switch.\n\nDecide whether to go with a plug-in hybrid or full EV\n\nWhile a conventional hybrid (HEV) relies on its gasoline engine and a small battery to work in tandem, a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) can operate on its battery alone \u2014 and burn no fuel \u2014 for a limited number of miles before the engine starts up to help.\n\nIf you never plug your PHEV in, it\u2019ll act just like a regular hybrid with the engine and battery trading off. So while you can charge your plug-in hybrid to get the benefits of battery-only driving over a short distance, you don\u2019t have to.\n\nA full EV, on the other hand, relies solely on its battery for power \u2014 which means it has to be charged regularly.\n\nCalculate your costs\n\nThere are a few elements to comparing the cost of an EV versus a conventional car. One is the cost to drive your vehicle off the lot. EVs are still more expensive up front: $81,833 compared to an industry median of $53,869. The median cost of a PHEV is somewhere in the middle (around $67,704).\n\nIf you install Level 2 home charging equipment, that\u2019ll add to your upfront cost (more on that in a minute).\n\nBut the real difference is in long-term costs, which vary widely based on factors like the car make and model; gas and electricity prices where you live; when and where you charge your EV; maintenance costs; and how much you drive.\n\nFor example, it\u2019s likely that your energy costs will be lower with an EV (electricity) versus a conventional car (gas) and somewhere in the middle with a PHEV. Use a calculator (like the FuelEconomy.gov\u2019s Plug-in Hybrid tool and eGallon comparison) to get a ballpark figure.\n\nInstall a charger at home\n\nMany electric car owners say that it\u2019s much easier and more convenient to install a charger at your home if you\u2019re able. Your vehicle is likely to spend the largest chunks of idle time parked in your garage or driveway, so if you can charge there you\u2019ll save yourself the hassle of waiting at a station.\n\nEditor's Note: In Australia, the lack of available chargers in public places will mean that this is essential.\n\nIf you live in an apartment or have to park on the street or in a public lot, you may be out of luck on this (unless you can convince your landlord or property manager to install charging equipment).\n\nSetting up home charging is pretty straightforward. You can plug a Level 1 charger right into a standard 120V outlet, though this will juice up your vehicle very slowly (3\u20138km per hour, according to Energy Department estimates).\n\nA Level 2 charger uses 240V, costs anywhere from a few hundred dollars to $1,500 or more to install, and works much faster \u2014 adding anywhere from about 16 to 30 or more kilometres of range per hour of charging. You can install this type of charger yourself or hire an electrician. Make sure you get the right parts for your vehicle. Tesla, for example, has a specific hardware and installation guide for its cars.\n\nPlan your driving routes ahead of time\n\nYour vehicle\u2019s range may be one of the biggest limitations to consider before you buy. EVs have a range of fewer than 480km, which makes longer trips difficult unless you can find charging stations along the way. PHEVs have very short driving ranges per charge \u2014 generally enough for commuting or running errands \u2014 but will switch to gas when needed.\n\nSince there are far more gas stations than charging stations, driving a full EV over longer distances requires some planning. Google Maps shows you nearby stations and what kind of equipment is available if you search \u201cEV Charging\u201d or \u201cEV Charging Stations.\u201d Apps like ChargeHub and PlugShare offer similar mapping features.\n\nEditor's Note: Travelling on Australian roads will mean even further planning, due to the previously mentioned lack of support for electric vehicles in the country.\n\nDepending on where and how much you drive, an EV\u2019s range may be plenty. But if you travel a lot, you may end up frustrated with charging stops and route planning if an EV is your only option. If charging stations are few and far between, if there\u2019s a line of cars already waiting, or if you simply don\u2019t want to stop for longer than a lunch break, this could get really old, really fast.\n\nA possible workaround: if you road trip less frequently, rent a car as needed for distances beyond your EV\u2019s range. Or go with a PHEV, which can switch to gas for longer journeys.\n\nUse the right charging equipment\n\nIf you have to charge your car away from home, make sure you use the right combination of charger and plug. Most vehicles have a standard J1772 port that connects with a Level 1 or Level 2 charging unit. Some cars can also connect to faster Level 3 charging equipment using one of a few different connectors (called CHAdeMO and SAE Combo).\n\nTeslas can hook up to proprietary Supercharger stations, though Tesla also sellsJ1772 and CHAdeMO adapters for stations outside of its network.\n\nYour car\u2019s specs should outline which connectors and charging systems your EV can use (or it\u2019s something you\u2019ll learn on day one of ownership). It is possible that not every charging station you encounter will have fast charging options, but you should be able to connect to any Level 2 charger with or without a J1772 adaptor.\n\nMaintain your vehicle\n\nEVs don\u2019t require regular oil changes like gas-powered cars. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can simply charge and go. You still have to attend to other standard-issue car maintenance tasks and regularly inflate and rotate your tires, change your wiper blades and keep an eye on brake pads. Some EV drivers report that underinflated tires can significantly affect your car\u2019s range. Basically, maintenance matters.\n\nBut most EVs come with much less frequent maintenance checks than conventional cars (case in point: the Chevy Bolt has no scheduled maintenance outside of tire rotations every 12,000km, air filter changes every 36,000km, and coolant flushes every 240,00km). There may be some minimal maintenance required on batteries and electronics, and of course, things can unexpectedly go haywire.\n\nBy contrast, PHEVs will be on similar schedules to conventional cars because they still have gas engines and associated fluids.\n\nDepending on your specific service needs, your neighbourhood mechanic may not be equipped for the job (if specialty tools are required, for example). In that case, you may need to seek out a dealer who works on your EV model.\n\nPrepare for extreme temperatures\n\nEVs have some quirks in cold weather. All cars are slightly less efficient in the winter, but EVs lose some of their range (25 per cent or more) because batteries are very sensitive to temperature. Plus, it takes energy to power climate control \u2014 whether you\u2019re running the heat or the air conditioning.\n\nOne way around this is to precondition your EV while it\u2019s plugged into your charger \u2014 this warms the car and the battery so stored energy goes toward powering your actual drive. It\u2019s similar to turning on your gas-powered car\u2019s heat before you actually need to get in and drive away, but with most EVs, you can turn on or schedule this function with a connected app. Heating both your battery and your EV\u2019s cabin ahead of time means you\u2019ll be warmer and your car will be more efficient despite the cold weather. You can also set preconditioning to work in the summer so your car is nice and cool for your commute.\n\nWith a PHEV, heat relies on the gas engine. If you want to stay on battery power, turn on your just heated seats until you can\u2019t handle the cold and need to blast the heat.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to turn your car off\n\nEVs are generally a lot quieter than regular vehicles \u2014 which means it\u2019s easy to get out, shut the door, and forget that the car is running. Remember to turn it off before you walk away. While it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll come close to draining your battery before you return, you probably shouldn\u2019t get in the habit of leaving it on. You may have the option to enable an alarm that goes off when you\u2019ve left your car running \u2014 and some EVs automatically shut off after a set amount of time.", "description": "Electric vehicles (EVs) are getting cheaper \u2014 so whether you\u2019re looking for a way to save on the hassle and cost of gas, shrink your carbon footprint, or simply zip around in a new Tesla, there are lots of reasons to consider a hybrid or electric car....", "authors": ["Tooran Alizadeh", "Edward Helderop", "Tony Grubesic", "Lisa Rowan"], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/l/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-20-at-8.28.15-am.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
