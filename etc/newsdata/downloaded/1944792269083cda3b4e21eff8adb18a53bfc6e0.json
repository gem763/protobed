But it\u2019s the damage they will incur getting there that has the president and his team worried.\n\nThat\u2019s where, they believe, his top allies should come in to run interference. In particular, there is growing frustration that Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, has not yet called hearings into the issues that sparked Trump\u2019s interest in Ukraine: Joe Biden\u2019s alleged and unfounded attempts to aid a business whose board his son sat on as well as a conspiracy theory that links Ukraine with 2016 election meddling.\n\n\"Senate Republicans don't have to defend Trump on everything, they just have to do their jobs,\u201d said one senior Trump operative. \u201cPart of that is holding hearings, calling witnesses, and forcing testimony on the misdeeds we already know about\u2014Ukraine\u2019s interference in the 2016 election against Trump, the Clinton campaign paying foreign sources to fabricate a dossier against Trump, the politically driven Kavanaugh smear campaign, the son of the former vice president influence-trading overseas, Adam Schiff trying to obtain dirt on Trump from the Ukrainian embassy, and more. What good is controlling half of Congress if Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff get to run the whole show anyway?\"\n\nThe complaints have come from the top down. One source who spoke to Trump in the past two weeks said that the president wondered aloud why Republican lawmakers couldn\u2019t be more like people such as Tom Fitton\u2014the Judicial Watch president who Trump regularly watches on Fox and often excitedly tweets about\u2014when defending him against the impeachment inquiry. And in public, Trump has increasingly let his dissatisfaction with Republican Senate leadership and others be known.\n\n\u201cRepublicans have to get tougher and fight,\u201d the president said at a cabinet meeting at the White House on Monday. \u201cWe have some that are great fighters, but they have to get tougher and fight because the Democrats are trying to hurt the Republican Party for the election.\u201d\n\nFor all the grumbling, however, the White House has appeared to have done very little to chart out a hearing process of their own. Graham has floated the idea of calling Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to testify. But those plans appear far off\u2014if not dead entirely\u2014as Giuliani has receded from the spotlight.\n\nGraham did not return a request for comment. But one senior Senate aide said that there has been little that the White House has offered that has given members there either direction or confidence.\n\n\u201cAs far as I know, there are no emissaries on the Hill telling us what to say on this,\u201d said the senior Senate GOP aide. \u201cI'm not going to rule out any work on our side in terms of looking into other things that are sort of adjacent to the investigations going on. But there is just not a lot of appetite among Senate Republicans. They are not very enthusiastic about defending the indefensible on this stuff.\u201d\n\nEvidence of the divide between the White House and Senate GOPers has emerged in recent days, with allies of the former\u2014including the president\u2019s son Don Jr.\u2014taking to Twitter to berate Republican lawmakers for not doing more, and members of the latter gently distancing themselves from the president on a range of fronts.\n\nOn Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said he did not \u201crecall any conversation with the president,\u201d in which he told Trump that his phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky was, in fact, \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\nThe Zelensky call is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry launched to determine if Trump threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine unless that government investigated Biden. And Trump has repeatedly said that McConnell privately told him that nothing wrong was uttered.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s remarks were noticed among other Hill Republicans, who have watched warily over the last few weeks as the White House has struggled to mount a defense to the damaging allegations emerging from the House proceedings. And they were widely interpreted as a message to the president that\u2014for all his demands that the Senate get more aggressive in rallying to his side\u2014he had to come up with a plan to defend himself first.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that people are attacking Senate Rs,\u201d texted one top Senate GOP aide. \u201cThe White House has literally no pushback to what the House is doing. No war room, nothing.\u201d\n\nWith little counterprogramming being planned currently by Senate Republicans, much of the White House\u2019s focus has drifted to other investigations that could shift the focus away from Trump. In particular, there is hope that a Department of Justice probe into the origins of the 2016 investigation into Trump and Russian electoral interference could turn up findings problematic for several prominent Democrats, chief among them Obama\u2019s former CIA Director John Brennan.\n\n\u201cIt seems [prosecutor John] Durham is working on this, and I suppose following his report, further action could be taken as warranted,\u201d said one senior White House official.\n\nBut not everyone in Trump\u2019s orbit is willing to wait patiently for Durham\u2019s findings. Indeed, some of Trump\u2019s favorite media sycophants have begun letting it be known that they expect more from the president\u2019s reliable fellow travelers on the Hill.\n\n\u201cThink about this, nothing is happening in the U.S. Senate\u2026 nothing!\u201d Lou Dobbs, a Fox Business host and top informal Trump adviser, said on his show Monday evening. As it were, Dobbs was talking to Fitton at the time. \u201cFor nine months, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee [Lindsey Graham] has not lifted a finger to help this president. He blathers little soundbites one side or another for or against the president every week, it seems, but has done nothing for the American people or truth, justice, and the American way.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is an embarrassment to the government of this country and its traditions,\u201d Dobbs added for good measure.\n\nTucker Carlson, another pro-Trump Fox personality who has privately advised the president on foreign policy, also took aim at Graham on Monday night. Speaking with Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), Carlson grumbled that Graham wasn\u2019t upholding his promise to get to the bottom of whether or not \u201ctop DOJ officials plotted a bureaucratic coup to overthrow the elected president.\u201d\n\nPaul, one of the president\u2019s most vocal defenders on Capitol Hill these days, suggested that Graham and other Republican senators were more loyal to the so-called Deep State than to Trump, adding that the South Carolina senator may want the Deep State to \u201cmaintain their power and maintain the intelligence community\u2019s enormous grip.\u201d", "description": "The president and his advisers want Republicans in the Senate to stage their own hearings to counteract what\u2019s happening in the House.", "authors": ["Sam Stein", "Asawin Suebsaeng", "Justin Baragona", "Politics Editor", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571793357/191022-swin-trump-impeachent-tease-2_bibxkq", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
