Getty\n\nThen there\u2019s Barwell, May\u2019s former chief of staff, one of a succession of ministers accused of failing to act to review building regulations for tower blocks when he was housing minister. That review could have helped to prevent tragedies like the Grenfell Tower fire. A deserving candidate for a knighthood indeed.\n\nMay\u2019s former communications chief Robbie Gibb is now Sir Robbie Gibb, an outcome described by Robert Peston as the \u201cfunniest thing ever\u201d.\n\n\u201cNo one in his role has ever been as hard to get hold of, or at least not in the 30 years I have been reporting this stuff,\u201d ITV\u2019s political editor said. Is this May\u2019s idea of \u201creally contributing\u201d?\n\nAnd when we look beyond her inner circle, of course, there\u2019s Geoffrey Boycott, the ex-England cricketer, offered a knighthood in spite of being convicted of assaulting his then partner, in his own words, \u201c25 years ago, love\u201d. It is something Boycott has always denied.\n\nAnd so we have an honours list marked by abhorrent, indefensible mistakes, by what some might call professional incompetence and by political players who propped up a wildly dysfunctional and increasingly undemocratic government. But that was ages ago right?. A couple of months, 25 years, what\u2019s the big deal?\n\nWell, in my view the honours system itself is an unnecessary relic of a colonial legacy that in this day and age should carry a lot less weight. In the space where there could be a celebration of nobility and fairness, there is an underbelly of nepotism and personal favour. And May has form in maintaining its rotten reputation.\n\nLast year, in a desperate bid to win over politicians to her Brexit deal, May\u2019s patronage fell on MPs like Brexiteer John Redwood and former Tory minister Gary Streeter. It was a cynical, transparent move then. It feels like a slap in the face now.\n\nAt the heart of my personal view about the honours system is the ridiculous reality that these people are placed on equal pegging, or above, those who really have dedicated their lives to others, whether through activism or individual acts of heroism.\n\nI know people who have spent years and years toiling in this country, who have quite literally supported hundreds, possibly thousands of people over the years, and who have led long, hard campaigns to improve people\u2019s lives before they even got close to such recognition. My late godfather, Isola Akay MBE, who founded the All Stars Boxing Gym in north west London, was one of them.\n\nThe powerful and valuable legacies of this country\u2019s real heroes have been cheapened by the audacious recognition of so many of these people \u2013 from Olly Robbins, architect of May\u2019s three-times rejected withdrawal deal, to Brandon Lewis, who famously reneged on a promise not to abstain on Brexit legislation when an opposition MP was pregnant. Why must we tolerate business as usual?.\n\nLike her predecessor David Cameron, who faced similar criticism for his final honours list, including from May herself, she doesn\u2019t care. Few prime ministers before her have. If anything, like a societal blacklight exposing our ugliest stains, this list is as true a reflection of how politics works in the UK as anything.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re still not convinced, if you think there is some practical use for this disreputable tradition, and in case you think the wheels of Westminster need greasing somehow, then just pause a second to imagine the parade of deadbeats and charlatans Boris Johnson will put forward from his own rogue government.", "description": "Do we live in a functioning meritocracy?
