The global economy is now in a synchronized slowdown,\u201d Georgieva said in a speech ahead of IMF-World Bank autumn meetings next week.\n\n\u201cThis widespread deceleration means that growth this year will fall to its lowest rate since the beginning of the decade.\u201d\n\nShe said the IMF is cutting its forecasts for growth this year and next. Previously, the world economy had been projected to expand by 3.2 percent in 2019 and 3.5 percent in 2020.\n\nThe fund is due to release details in its updated World Economic Outlook on October 15.\n\nWhile trade tensions had been talked about as a danger to the economy, \u201cnow, we see that they are actually taking a toll,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cGlobal trade growth has come to a near standstill.\u201d\n\nFor the global economy, the cumulative effect of trade conflicts could mean a loss of around $700 billion by 2020, or about 0.8 percent of GDP, she said, which is far higher than the fund previously forecast as its worst case scenario.\n\nThat is an amount \u201capproximately the size of Switzerland\u2019s entire economy,\u201d she said.\n\nIMF research shows the secondary effects of the trade war \u2014 such as the loss of confidence and financial market reactions \u2014 are far greater than the direct economic impact of the tariffs.\n\n\u201cIt is the indirect impacts that really bite,\u201d Georgieva said of the trade war during a forum following her speech.\n\nShe warned that \u201conce undermined, confidence is hard to rebuild.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are already shooting ourselves in the foot.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Spend more \u2013\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China involves steep tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in two-way commerce but there are conflicts with other trading partners as well.\n\nAnd even if growth resurges next year, some of the \u201crifts\u201d already caused by the trade conflicts could cause \u201cchanges that last a generation,\u201d such as shifting supply chains, she said.\n\n\u201cThe results are clear. Everyone loses in a trade war,\u201d Georgieva said.\n\nTo protect against a sharp global slowdown, she called on countries with funds available to deploy their \u201cfiscal firepower.\u201d\n\nWhile some governments are burdened by high debt levels, \u201cin places such as Germany, the Netherlands, and South Korea, an increase in spending \u2014 especially in infrastructure and R&D \u2014 will help boost demand and growth potential,\u201d Georgieva said.\n\nMany economies have been relying on central banks and low interest rates to support economic expansion but she warned that keeping rates low for too long can cause investors to engage in risky behavior.\n\nThe IMF estimates that if there were a major economic downturn, \u201ccorporate debt at risk of default would rise to $19 trillion, or nearly 40 percent of the total debt in eight major economies,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis is above the levels seen during the financial crisis.\u201d\n\nGeorgieva, who this month took over leadership at the IMF from Christine Lagarde amid rising concerns about the world economy, called on global leaders \u201cto work together, now, and find a lasting solution on trade.\u201d\n\nThat includes resolving legitimate concerns over protection of proprietary technology, an issue at the center of Washington\u2019s dispute with Beijing.\n\nBut she also said policymakers for too long have ignored the people harmed by globalization, which tends to be good for \u201cthe educated, urban, younger people.\u201d\n\nThe key, she said, is to recognize that \u201cinequalities are a drag on multilateralism and drag on growth.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Raising carbon taxes \u2013\n\nMeanwhile, Georgieva said addressing the climate change crisis will require a change in national tax systems that includes a big ramp-up in levies on carbon emissions.\n\n\u201cIt is a crisis where no one is immune and everyone has a responsibility to act,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cLimiting global warming to a safe level requires a significantly higher carbon price,\u201d she said.\n\nBut she added that \u201cthe key here is to change tax systems, not simply add a new tax.\u201d\n\nAt the current average carbon price of $2 a ton, there is little incentive to make a transition to new forms of energy.\n\nThese new tax revenues could be used to mitigate damage and \u201calso support investments in the clean energy infrastructure that will help the planet heal,\u201d she said.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Grinding trade disputes are undermining the global economy, which is set to see its slowest growth in nearly a decade, the new", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/199011_newly-installed-international-monetary-fund-imf-managing-kristalina-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
