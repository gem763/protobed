Joni Ernst (R-IA) slammed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) Thursday, saying that Iowans are tired of her \u201cplaying\u201d impeachment \u201cgames.\u201d\n\nSen. Ernst criticized House Speaker Pelosi for suggesting she was unwilling to answer a CNN reporter who questioned if it is acceptable for President Donald Trump to pressure foreign countries to interfere in an American election.\n\nDuring the interview, Sen. Ernst said, \u201cWe have a picture that\u2019s painted by media,\u201d and the Senate Intelligence Committee and other committees \u201cwill sort it out without media interdiction.\u201d\n\nCiting Sen. Ernst\u2019s interview with CNN, Pelosi said that \u201cRepublicans are refusing to answer the simplest question.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerican elections should be decided by Americans, not by \u2018favors\u2019 from foreign governments,\u201d Pelosi said, referring to President Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky:\n\nActually, American elections should be decided by ELECTIONS. Not politicians. I know you\u2019re still upset about the results from 2016, but people here in Iowa would sure appreciate it if you spent less time playing political games and actually brought #USMCAnow up for a vote. https://t.co/YM07a1MXbl \u2014 Joni Ernst (@joniernst) October 10, 2019\n\nSen. Ernst responded, saying Iowans want Pelosi to stop \u201cplaying\u201d impeachment \u201cpolitical games\u201d and pass useful legislation, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).\n\n\u201cActually, American elections should be decided by ELECTIONS.
