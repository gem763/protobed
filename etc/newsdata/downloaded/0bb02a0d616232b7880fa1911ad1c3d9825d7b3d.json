The organization says children who start playing tackle football at the age of 5 have 10 times the risk of developing the degenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy compared to those who wait until they are 14.\n\n\u201cTackle football is really a man\u2019s game, and it\u2019s incredibly dangerous to the developing brain,\u201d CLF co-founder Chris Nowinski says in a video accompanying the ad .\n\n\u201cWe now have the data that show that playing youth tackle football and developing CTE is correlated in a very similar way to smoking, and developing lung cancer,\u201d Nowinski said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to help parents visualize that those two things are equally bad: Letting your kid smoke and letting your kid play tackle football are both bad ideas.\u201d\n\nSome states, including California, New York and Illinois, have discussed banning tackle football for children under 12. Until then, the PSA hopes to let parents know about the risks.\n\nAccording to the foundation, the ad released Thursday cost $126,095 to produce. Many of the services were donated by those who have been affected by CTE, the degenerative brain disease that has been connected to repetitive blows to the head in contact sports like football and boxing.\n\nThe spot\u2019s creator is Angela Campigotto-Harrison, whose father, Joe Campigotto, played college football and developed stage 4 CTE even though he was never diagnosed with a concussion. Director Rebecca Carpenter, whose father played 10 years in the NFL and spent three more decades as a coach , worked for scale; Lew Carpenter was also diagnosed with advanced CTE.\n\nLook closely, and you may notice that the referee in the PSA is former San Francisco 49ers linebacker Chris Borland, who retired from the NFL at the age of 24 after one season - and two diagnosed concussions.\n\n\u201cWaiting to play until later is better for the health of young athletes and obviously better for their brains,\u201d Borland said in a separate video . \u201cWe don\u2019t need to use young kids as guinea pigs. We can retool the game where they can still glean the benefits, enjoy themselves, get exercise and delay tackle football until junior high or high school.\u201d\n\nThe PSA, which will be released for TV, digital and social media, carries a note that the smoking shown on screen is simulated.\n\nThe behind the scenes video notes that the football was also safe.\n\n\u201cDuring filming, no players were allowed to tackle,\u201d the disclaimer says. \u201cA stunt coordinator oversaw the production as two certified teenage stunt actors simulated tackling.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Everybody seems to be having fun when the kids in a new public service announcement are just playing football, until one boy is thrown to the ground and the background music turns ominous.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jimmy Golen"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
