They have been talking about it since before he even became the Republican nominee \u2014 as early as April 2016.\n\nIn late September, as Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) decided to push for an impeachment inquiry, the conservative media monitoring website NewsBusters noted that the nation was approaching its \u201c36th straight month of media-driven impeachment talk.\u201d It published a video showing television talking heads discussing impeachment since November 2016.\n\nBut the media obsession with impeachment is even older.\n\nIn an article published April 17, 2016, titled, \u201cCould Trump Be Impeached Shortly After He Takes Office?\u201c, Politico\u2018s Darren Samuelson wrote that a Trump presidency could be so disruptive that he \u201chas critics on the right and the left discussing the most extreme of countermeasures at an unusually early point in the race.\u201d\n\nHe wrote:\n\n\u201cImpeachment\u201d is already on the lips of pundits, newspaper editorials, constitutional scholars, and even a few members of Congress. \u2026 It\u2019s not unusual for controversial presidents to be shadowed by talkof impeachment, once they\u2019ve been in office long enough to make people mad. But before he\u2019s elected? Before he\u2019s a nominee? Constitutional experts of all political stripes say it\u2019s surprising for impeachment talk to bubble up this early\u2014but then Trump has been throwing around some surprising ideas for a leading candidate \u2026 And doubtless many of Trump\u2019s foes would like to see him impeached just on principle\u2014the quickest way to broom out a leader who horrifies the inclusive sensibilities of Democrats, and has blown apart the Republican Party he\u2019s nominally part of.\n\nSo impeachment was a first resort for Democrats, NeverTrump Republicans, and journalists from the moment it became clear that candidate Trump had a path to win the GOP nomination \u2014 even when few of them believed he could actually defeat likely Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton and win the presidency in November 2016.\n\nNewsBusters\u2019 video covers TV journalists, so it is not inaccurate. But the Beltway media\u2019s obsession with impeachment goes back much further than that.\n\nJoel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.
