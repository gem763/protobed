Telecom carriers are excited about the potential 5G holds and consumers can't wait to have faster download and streaming speeds. But some are more worried about the possible dangers of the technology.\n\nWhat's all the commotion about?\n\nYou see, 5G uses high-frequency millimeter wavelengths to propagate, which many believe can have adverse effects of public health. It's not necessarily a new fear, that's been the case many times over the past couple of decades. Before this, people were worried about cellphones in general causing health problems, and before that was microwaves.\n\nThe general fear is that radio waves cause everything from brain cancer, to infertility, to migraines, and more. Most of these were completely unsubstantiated too, but mass panic tends to take hold regardless of that.\n\nDon't Miss 210 SHARES 377 SHARES 517 SHARES\n\nAnd that was just with the few cell towers we had then. Since 5G uses waves with a slightly smaller wavelength than previous cell technology, and has a shorter range, we'll need more towers to be set up, many of which will be in the middle of urban centres. So of course, that's reigniting old fears.\n\nSo is 5G bad?\n\nSo far, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the US both still maintain that there's nothing to worry about. They insist most studies have found no link between radio waves and illnesses. There have been some however, and that's enough to give pause. Additionally, the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2011 said cellphones might be linked to some kinds of brain cancer, so there's at least some element of uncertainty.\n\nThat's why certain groups at least are proceeding cautiously. In April this year, Brussels halted 5G tests it was carrying out, citing potentially harmful radiation. Parliament Members in Netherlands are asking for a stay on planned 5G tests as well, at least until the government looks into any safety issues with the technology. Similarly, Switzerland is also monitoring trials in the country very closely, and New Hampshire in the US is considering establishing a special commission to study the health effects of the technology.\n\nWhat does radio wave science say?\n\nBased on how radio waves are classified, we should ideally be able to clearly differentiate between radiation that is harmful and what's not. See, technically radiation is when energy is emitted from a source. So when your body gives off heat that's also radiation. Of course, you're not likely giving people around you cancer unless you took a swim in a nuclear reactor or you're Dr Manhattan.\n\nSome forms of radiation can make you sick, and those are classified as ionizing radiation. This includes ultraviolet and gamma radiation, as well as X-rays, basically those with higher frequencies and smaller wavelengths. These have the capability to rip atoms apart and split DNA, causing cancer and more. That's why you're advised against getting too many X-rays in a year.\n\nNon-ionizing radiation meanwhile has lower frequencies and bigger wavelengths, and doesn't cause damage to the cells. This kind of radiation includes radio frequency (RF), television signals, and traditional 3G and 4G signals. Microwave radiation also falls in the non-ionizing block of the spectrum. And more importantly, so do millimetre waves, which are somewhere between 4G signals and microwaves. Ideally, that should mean it's perfectly safe.\n\nThere's a \"but\" coming isn't there?\n\nYou see, the main problem critics have is that it's all well and good to say 5G falls in the safe portion of the radiation spectrum. However, no one's yet completed any conclusive tests regarding the technology and its effects on health. They want more information before governments decide to just pop these up over cities across the world.\n\nThe FCC for instance, which says 5G is fine, hasn't actually updated its cellphone safety standards since 1996. Which means their standards could be completely inaccurate, seeing as they don't apply to current day wireless technology. On the other hand, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) has reviewed this, and they say that the safety levels of wireless technology remain largely unchanged from 1996. So who do you believe?\n\nHas no one really thought to test this?\n\nWell that's the thing, there have been some studies carried out on cellphone radiation in general before. The American Cancer Society for instance lists a few studies on cellphone radiation, pointing out that none of them found a direct link between mobile signals and cancer. However, most of them have so many variables and inconsistencies in results, despite care taken, that it's impossible to apply them to humans. So essentially, they can't truthfully say 5G is harmless\n\nAnd in addition to that, another study from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in 2010 suggested that there are other ways for cellphone radiation to disrupt the human body, aside from ionization. It talked about something called oxidative stress in cells, caused by an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants. This can lead to inflammation and has been linked to the onset of cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular, neurological and pulmonary diseases. And there's never been a study to explore that topic further.\n\nAnd all of that was research on 2G, 3G, and 4G signals, no one's even gotten to testing the 5G frequencies we'll use yet. They're still in the non-ionizing band, meaning they're just incapable of generating enough energy to directly break apart DNA. But the truth is we just don't know what else they could do.\n\nThe oxidative stress theory is just one, there could be countless other ways 5G sparks off cascading changes that ruin living cells. We won't know what they are until we find them, and that could be an issue when we'll need five times denser infrastructure than for 4G.\n\nAnd without active investigation, we not know anytime soon. As experts point out, it took 20 to 25 years after we began mass producing cigarettes before anyone realised they had a direct link to cancer. We've only been using mobile phones for about that much time now, and there's absolutely no mass-usage of 5G yet, to get a large enough dataset to analyse.\n\nSo essentially, we're flying blind. We don't know if 5G is safe at all. We're just hoping it is as we barrell forward with pushing it out to every industry imaginable.", "description": "With 5G technology incoming, we\u2019re being promised faster speeds and lower latency connections, not to mention the ability to improve things like self-driving cars, mobile AR experiences, and more.
