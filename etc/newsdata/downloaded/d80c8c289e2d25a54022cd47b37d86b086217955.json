No one is more surprised than me!", "language": "en", "text": "Claudia Winkleman is not very big on ablutions. \u2018I think the last time I washed my face was in the 1980s!\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve never used a facial cleanser and I never, ever take my make-up off before I go to bed. I think we can all agree if you\u2019re leaning over a sink with some toner on a ball of cotton wool at the end of the evening, then life has gone badly wrong.\u2019\n\nOn she chats.\n\n\u2018So if I\u2019m in the bath with my eight-year-old, I might go mad and splash some water on. But I generally get into bed fully made-up \u2014 I have better dreams that way.\u2019\n\nThen the next day, she says, she\u2019ll drop the kids off while wearing yesterday\u2019s make-up \u2014 \u2018I let it crisp up on the school run\u2019 \u2014 and finally wash it off in the shower the following day.\n\n\u2018Life is just too short for complicated beauty regimes,\u2019 she says.\n\nStrictly host, Claudia Winkleman, 47, (pictured) who is one of the BBC's top earning women, reflected on her career success\n\nWhich is perhaps why, close up, she is a bit disconcerting-looking. Vast eyes inked in thick, gothic Alice Cooper\u2013style liner; skier-white lipstick; a thick, dark extremely angular helmet of hair; and, of course, orange, orange, orange! Every inch of skin on display \u2014 slim ankles, a knee through a ripped jean, slender hands poking out of her navy polo-neck\u2019s sleeves and, most of all, her face \u2014 is distinctly Jaffa.\n\n\u2018Next week I\u2019m going to \u2018double dip\u2019!\u2019 she says. \u2018I\u2019m going to go really dark. As I say to my kids: if you\u2019re doing to do something, really do it!\u2019\n\nWhile, of course, a deep fake tan is mandatory for a Strictly Come Dancing host, the rest of her distinctive \u2018look\u2019 is very much not.\n\nParticularly the dense, choppy fringe that covers half her face \u2014 \u2018I\u2019m going to keep growing it until it covers my whole face like a curtain.\u2019\n\nClaudia insists it is part uniform, part protective armour and mostly lazy shortcut to doing the absolute minimum necessary to look presentable.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a cheat. If you\u2019ve got a fringe, your look is sort of done and you never, ever have to change it, which suits me as I am fantastically lazy. I am the most lazy person you\u2019ll ever meet,\u2019 says one of the highest-paid women on television.\n\nThanks to Strictly and her weekly Radio 2 show on Sunday, Claudia, 47, has risen to become one of the BBC\u2019s two top-earning on-air women (along with Zoe Ball), commanding a salary of between \u00a3370,000 and \u00a3374,999 a year according to the BBC\u2019s annual report released this summer.\n\nShe also earns an undisclosed amount as brand ambassador for the shampoo Head & Shoulders, which she says she\u2019s been using for decades. (\u2018I actually bloody love it! My dad used it, my stepdad used it, my kids use it, my husband loves it. It has the consistency of yoghurt, it lathers like a dream.\u2019)\n\nClaudia (pictured with Claudia with her Strictly co-host Tess Daly) earns an undisclosed amount as brand ambassador for Head & Shoulders, fans have sent her many questions about her hair\n\nWhile we might not all want to replicate every aspect of Claudia\u2019s very distinctive look, her fans are obsessed with her hair.\n\n\u2018I had a fantasy that when I went on Strictly, I\u2019d get letters from fishermen who painted on Sundays and could make a good stew and would ask me out to dinner,\u2019 she says. \u2018But every single message is about my hair and only about my hair. Why is it so shiny? What products do I use? And have I ever thought of not having a fringe? Over and over.\u2019\n\nNot that she\u2019ll ever change what she calls \u2018Fringeworld\u2019. \u2018I can\u2019t,\u2019 she says,\u2019 because a) my forehead is a disgrace. I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s up there. There could be squirrels living up there, possibly a toucan. And with a fringe, I don\u2019t need Botox. I don\u2019t need to do anything at all.\u2019\n\n(I ask several times to see if her forehead is wrinkly, but she won\u2019t even show me her eyebrows. I can just see them lurking as she bounces about.)\n\nAnd b)?\n\n\u2018I think genuinely it\u2019s the only reason I get employed. They might not know my name, so they just say: \u201cYou know, the fringe one.\u201d \u2019\n\nClaudia\u2019s rise has certainly been stratospheric \u2014 from reporter on BBC\u2019s Holiday, to hostess of a series of minor quiz shows to appearances on This Morning, to presenting Strictly Come Dancing\u2019s week-night spin-off It Takes Two from 2004. She has been presenting the main Strictly show, alongside Tess Daly, since 2014.\n\nClaudia (pictured) revealed she loves the adrenaline that comes with working for live TV, in the same way that she used to love exams\n\nEven her mum, Fleet Street doyenne Eve Pollard (who, one might assume, has been at Claudia\u2019s side, advising and negotiating) admitted it all sort of crept up and took them unawares. \u2018Nobody\u2019s more surprised than me,\u2019 says Claudia. \u2018I don\u2019t know how to explain it. I feel incredibly bonkers lucky [here she starts clambering up the sofa in search of wood to touch], and I assume it will end any minute now. And that\u2019s also fine. It can end, and I am incredibly grateful for what I\u2019ve had.\u2019\n\nAs to the question, why her, she insists she\u2019s as bewildered as the rest of us.\n\n\u2018I think I was in the right place at the right time, you know \u2014 \u201cOh, yes, you can have a go if you want.\u201d And when I\u2019m there, I work hard. Although I might not look it with my fringe and eyeliner, I am also very obedient. I am always on time and very friendly and helpful.\u2019\n\nShe describes her job as \u2018reading aloud\u2019. \u2018I think it\u2019s a lot easier than you think,\u2019 she adds. \u2018I think most people are good at it.\u2019\n\nAnti-ageing? Are you mad? I want to look 47. . . With a fringe I don\u2019t need Botox \u2014 I haven\u2019t seen my forehead for years\n\nPerhaps her passion for live TV helps. While many presenters loathe it, she adores the buzz. When, in 2010, and to some people\u2019s consternation, she succeeded Jonathan Ross to present BBC\u2019s film review show for six years, Claudia insisted on doing it live. She\u2019s good at it, too \u2014 natural, funny, a bit kooky, immensely likeable and fantastically relaxed.\n\n\u2018Imagine if a camera came in now,\u2019 she cries. \u2018We\u2019d be outstanding! We\u2019d sit differently. Our chat would be better.\n\n\u2018I love the adrenaline, knowing it could all go skew-whiff. I used to love exams \u2014 how you get one shot. I\u2019m always trying to explain to my eldest that if you\u2019re doing GCSEs, then really do them. I am the opposite of a perfectionist; I just like to get things done.\u2019\n\nClaudia (pictured with Tess Daly) recalls growing up in a household where her feminist mother insisted on not focusing on appearance\n\nClaudia adds that when she and her brother did work experience as teens, Eve and stepfather Sir Nicholas Lloyd, former editor of the Daily Express, drummed it into them to \u2018be the first there, the last to leave, be helpful and make tea and coffee\u2019.\n\nEve had a few other useful life lessons, too. For starters, the entire house was mirror-free, and the whole family fostered a very relaxed attitude to nudity, wandering around naked as they got ready to go out or putting the kids to bed.\n\n\u2018Mum was a staunch feminist and would say: \u201cLife\u2019s too short to worry about your shell \u2014 what you look like is the least interesting thing about you.\u201d \u2019 Claudia insists that, as a result, she isn\u2019t remotely vain. \u2018We weren\u2019t allowed to be. I don\u2019t think I even knew what I looked like until university!\u2019\n\nAlso banned were Barbie Dolls, ballet lessons, trying to be cool and television.\n\n\u2018I think that\u2019s why I went into television, because it felt so intoxicating to me,\u2019 she says.\n\n(Now she and husband, Danish producer Kris Thykier, have their own children, Jake, 15, Matilda, 13, and eight-year-old Arthur, Claudia has followed suit with just one mirror in their Westminster home \u2014 reserved for tooth-brushing. She is extremely body-unselfconscious and open, and has never locked a loo door in her life.)\n\nShe can\u2019t get her head round her career success.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s lots of us girls \u2014 all adorable and good at it \u2014 Davina, Holly, Tess, Fern, Emma Willis. We\u2019re having a laugh and we\u2019re grateful. Unbelievably grateful. Because ten or 15 years ago at 47 . . . exactly!\u2019 she cries, referring to the fading shadow of ageism in the world of TV.\n\nClaudia (pictured with husband, Kris Thykier) says that she doesn't do much exercise, focusing instead on healthy eating\n\nNot that she seems remotely bothered about getting older and insists she has no truck with specialist products.\n\n\u2018Anti-ageing? Are you mad?\u2019 she shrieks. \u2018I have clean hair and I sleep. That train has left the station, so what are you going to do? So bring it, bring it! I want to look 47, and next year I will look 48.\u2019\n\nShe also says she does almost no exercise. \u2018I once went to a spinning class six times,\u2019 she recalls. \u2018It was so fun; I felt like I\u2019d been to a nightclub. I felt absolutely amazing because I\u2019m almost agoraphobic and I never go out.\u2019 But then she got costochondritis (a painful inflammation of the chest muscles), which she blames on her poor posture (\u2018I\u2019m like a tortoise!\u2019) and had to stop.\n\nSo she tried yoga. \u2018I went once, but they told me to breathe, and I was like: \u201cI am!\u201d\n\nInstead, she tries to eat healthily and avoid sugar, but usually caves in at 4pm when she picks up Arthur, whom she calls Bear, from school, and tucks into his snacks.\n\nThen she took up bridge.\n\n\u2018Bridge is my sport! I am obsessed with bridge. It is the greatest thing, and you get to sit down. You\u2019ve got to do it. It will change your life. That and a Gravity blanket! I sound like a 98-year-old woman.\u2019\n\nShe goes on to stress, several more times, that she\u2019s the most boring and lazy person I will ever meet, while sounding anything but.\n\n\u2018I eat the same food, in the same restaurants. I am not experimental. I am never going to wake up and say: \u201cToday I\u2019m going to wear pink gingham and put my hair in bunches,\u201d \u2019 she says.\n\nThough she did recently have what she calls \u2018a midlife crisis\u2019 and have the ends of her hair dyed blonde. \u2018I couldn\u2019t help myself! And I got this [she waves her teeny thumb at me]: a 40-quid thumb ring.\u2019\n\nClaudia's daughter Matilda (pictured in 2014 with Kris) suffered terrible injuries when her Halloween costume caught fire in 2014\n\nNext, she wants a tattoo.\n\n\u2018I would love one,\u2019 she enthuses. \u2018Not hidden. If I\u2019m having a tattoo, I want it out there. So maybe the names of all my children, possibly my address. My mum\u2019s phone number. The kids\u2019 favourite things to snack on . . .\u2019\n\nWhile she is very funny, good company, incredibly chatty and clearly extremely clever \u2014 privately educated at City of London School for Girls, she went on to get a good degree in art history from Cambridge \u2014 Claudia is relentlessly trivial. She adores a detail, any detail: about a favourite blanket; her love for brandy butter; how she leaves her boots on in bed for her morning nap; loves rain; hates summer; and how bright white she is underneath the fake tan.\n\nShe uses trivia to deflect anything more significant \u2014 her vast salary, current affairs (other than admitting to sitting \u2018mouth agape\u2019 in shock while watching the Ten O\u2019Clock News), or the terrible injuries her then eight-year-old daughter Matilda suffered in 2014 when her Halloween costume caught fire.\n\n\u2018I heard her shout and she was on fire,\u2019 she said at the time. \u2018It was like those horrific birthday candles that you blow out and they come back. It was really fast.\u2019\n\nToday, nearing the fifth anniversary, she won\u2019t be drawn on that \u2018life-changing\u2019 night, but says she counts her blessings constantly.\n\nShe is also obsessively self-deprecatory about everything from career success to how slim she is.\n\n\u2018I am so not!\u2019 she cries, immediately grabbing and squeezing a teeny thigh.\n\nShe shrieks \u2018Disgusting! Disgusting!\u2019 when the photos pop up on the screen of her looking, frankly, gorgeous at the photoshoot.\n\nAnd she refuses to accept she is remotely famous.\n\nClaudia (pictured with Kris) once founder herself in tears because of work commitments, she now works hard for the last few months of the year and protects the rest\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t even say that!\u2019 she squeals. \u2018I\u2019m definitely not famous. I\u2019m on the Tube four times a day \u2014 which idiot sends their kids to different schools? \u2014 and I\u2019m never, ever recognised.\u2019\n\nBut she glows when she talks of her family. Her 73-year-old mum, who was \u2018so embarrassing\u2019 when she was a child, but to whom Claudia now talks three times a day and is \u2018brilliant\u2019 at advice; how she would choose her teenage son over anyone to have dinner with (\u2018He\u2019s magnificent and very funny\u2019); babying Arthur (\u2018I still cut up his sausages!\u2019); and teaching her children her mantra: \u2018Be nothing else but funny and kind.\u2019\n\nSpending enough time with the kids is her biggest priority.\n\nA few years ago, when she was juggling the BBC film show with a magazine column and Strictly, she found herself weeping and overwhelmed in John Lewis on Christmas Eve at all the time she\u2019d missed with her kids.\n\nSo she turned down Film 2016 and, earlier this year, gave up the magazine column. While she used to get drawn into other BBC presenting gigs including The Great British Sewing Bee and last year Britain\u2019s Best Home Cook with Mary Berry, this year she hasn\u2019t done anything since the live final of Icons: The Greatest Person Of The 20th Century back in February.\n\n\u2018Now I work hard for the last few months of the year and fiercely protect the rest,\u2019 she says.\n\nGiven she\u2019s now the Beeb\u2019s favourite female megastar, she could probably choose any show. But when I ask what she fancies next, she looks shocked.\n\n\u2018Nothing! Nothing at all. I\u2019ve far, far exceeded my own expectations. I just want to say thank you very much indeed.\u2019\n\nClaudia Winkleman is an ambassador for Head & Shoulders (headandshoulders.co.uk).", "description": "Claudia Winkleman, 47, who is one of the BBC's top earning women, revealed the secret to her success.
