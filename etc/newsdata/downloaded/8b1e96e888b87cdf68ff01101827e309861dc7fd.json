The bank slashed this year\u2019s economic growth forecast to 2.2% in July, but that is still far above projections by private-sector organizations, which are as low as 1.4%.\n\nThe BOK is widely expected to lower rates at its next meeting on Oct. 16, after holding fire at its last meeting in August. The central bank surprised markets with a cut in July, the first reduction in three years.\n\nS&P Global Ratings chief economist Shaun Roache told Reuters on Wednesday that deflation pressure was the biggest domestic risk facing South Korea's economy, adding that he expected two more rate cuts by early next year.\n\nThe Reuters poll also expects industrial output in August to have contracted by a seasonally adjusted 0.5% from a month earlier.\n\nAugust industrial output data will be released at 8 a.m. on Monday local time (2300 GMT Sunday).\n\nSeptember trade data is due to be published at 9 a.m. on Tuesday (0000 GMT) while inflation figures are expected an hour earlier (2300 GMT Monday).", "description": "South Korea exports seen falling for 10th month on trade, chip sector woes: poll", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8Q07B_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
