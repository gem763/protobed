More than 11,000 men and women of the SDF gave their lives fighting Isis before the group was defeated in March this year.\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s attitude will create a negative impact on the whole region, and what has been built up here, the peace and the stability in this region \u2013 this American decision will destroy all the advances, particularly with regards to security,\u201d said Amjed Osman, a spokesperson for the Syrian Democratic Council.\n\n\u201cWe have always said that Erdo\u011fan\u2019s threats are serious. There is no serious international will to bring an end to the Syrian crisis. The Turkish threats mean that the situation in this region will return to point zero. There will be chaos once again,\u201d he added.\n\nThere is much speculation that the impending attack has been prompted by Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s domestic troubles: in important local elections this year the Turkish president lost control of four of Turkey\u2019s major cities, including the capital, Ankara, and economic centre Istanbul. The rejection of his Justice and Development party (AKP) by voters all over the country \u2013 including crucial Kurdish blocs \u2013 was widely viewed as a recrimination for the government\u2019s handling of Turkey\u2019s economic crisis.\n\nThe last time Erdo\u011fan\u2019s grip on power slipped, in 2015\u2019s general election, the president restarted the war with the Kurdistan Workers party (PKK). The attempts at a new Turkish incursion into Rojava are seen by many as a fresh attempt to shore up support by rallying Turks around a nationalistic cause.\n\n\u201cThe [Turkish] government is in the middle of a deep crisis and they are gradually falling from power. Thus, Erdo\u011fan is seeking every opportunity to fulfil his Ottoman fantasies,\u201d said Bahoz Erdal, a member of the PKK executive committee, on an affiliated radio station.\n\n\u201cErdo\u011fan has nothing but the war on the Kurds to maintain his power. It was proved in the latest elections that the [party] the Kurds back would come to power.\u201d\n\nThe US withdrawal from northern Syria creates the perfect conditions for war crimes | Simon Tisdall Read more\n\nThe idea of a US exit was first floated in December last year. Since then, across hundreds of kilometres of border, the SDF has been digging defensive ditches and tunnels to slow any incoming Turkish vehicles.\n\nSmall Turkish incursions in 2016 and 2018 incurred large territorial losses for the SDF: a new Turkish assault, a Nato ally with a powerful air force, is a bigger threat in the minds of many than that posed by Isis.\n\n\u201cResistance is life\u201d is the Syrian Kurdish mantra\u2013 one that Osman echoed on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe are here on the ground, in our own land. We have a military force, we have a political will, we have a people who support our military and political forces.\n\n\u201cWe will not just wait here for the Turks to come \u2013 our military forces will resist.\u201d", "description": "Kurdish-held territories of north-eastern Syria prepare for assault by Turkish forces \u2013 and insist they will resist", "authors": ["Mohammed Rasool In Irbil"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7d72ef7d9085ab580e6e323a32dd05b0289af07/0_299_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=163525c46ed090416d694cac6a8ee427", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
