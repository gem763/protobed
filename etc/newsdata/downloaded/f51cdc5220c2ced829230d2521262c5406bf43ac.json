EDGARD GARRIDO/REUTERS\n\nSANTIAGO, Chile - Chilean President Sebastian Pinera announced measures on Tuesday aimed at stemming days of protests over economic inequality that have swept the country and claimed 15 lives.\n\nApologizing to the nation for failing to anticipate the outbreak of social unrest, Pinera said his government had \"received with humility and clarity the message Chileans have given us\".\n\nHe vowed to increase the universal basic pension by 20 percent, cancel a recent 9.2 percent increase in electricity bills and proposed a law that would see the state cover the costs of expensive medical treatment.\n\n\"I recognize this lack of vision and I apologize to my compatriots,\" Pinera said in an address from the presidential palace in Santiago.\n\nPinera also pledged a state subsidy to increase the minimum wage to 350,000 pesos ($482) a month and said the government would introduce health insurance for medications, which are among the most expensive in the region.\n\nEarlier in the day, the president met with the leaders of some of Chile's opposition parties as he sought a way to stem the country's worst violence in decades, initially triggered by an increase in metro fares.\n\nThe protests, which began on Friday, mushroomed into a broader outcry against social and economic woes, including a yawning gap between rich and poor in a country normally considered one of the most stable in Latin America.\n\nPinera quickly suspended the metro fare hike, but also declared that Chile was \"at war against a powerful, implacable enemy\", and imposed a state of emergency in Santiago and most of Chile's 16 regions.\n\nAdopting a more conciliatory tone, he later called for Tuesday's meeting, which was boycotted by three of the largest opposition groups, including the powerful Socialist Party.\n\nThe day's protests were mostly peaceful, particularly in the capital, although looting continued in other towns.\n\nRiot police used tear gas and water cannons on Tuesday to break up marches by rock-throwing demonstrators in several parts of Santiago, while soldiers and police guarded other Chileans who formed long lines at supermarkets.\n\n\"I've walked several kilometers searching for milk, but the supermarkets remain closed and neighborhood stores have run out,\" said Carmen Fuentealba, a retiree.", "description": "Chilean President Sebastian Pinera announced measures on Tuesday aimed at stemming days of protests over economic inequality that have swept the country and claimed 15 lives.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/24/5db0fdfaa310cf3e97a2af26.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
