They studied the lungs from 52 individuals, including 15 who did not have asthma, 21 who had asthma but died of other causes and 16 who died of asthma.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

This unique phenomenon makes them a reliable, useful tool in many areas of research. In particular, materials science and 'packing' - how things fit together. Bubble walls drain under gravity, thin at the top, thick at the bottom and interferes with travelling lightwaves to create bands of colour.

Their diet is sea plankton and their coloration comes from the uptake of algae in the water. Some jellyfish species have been documented eating plastics in the ocean. One theory suggests that algae grows on the plastic. As it breaks down, the algae creates the odor of dimethyl sulfide that attracts hungry animals. - Mary Anne Chilton Mary Anne Chilton/RPS 3/9 Tribolium confusum. Confused flour beetle.

The pin ionizes the air around it. When the electrons fall back on an atom, the excess energy is emitted as a photon, which generate the corona glow around the pin. The fuzziness of the pin is because the camera did not actually capture light reflected on the pin but rather the light emitted by the ionized light around it. - Richard Germain Richard Germain/RPS 6/9 Calmness of Eternity Himalayas mountains, Nepal.

The observation points at true airway changes that are associated with obesity.\n\n\u201cWe need to investigate this finding in more detail and particularly whether this phenomenon can be reversed with weight loss.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, we should support asthma patients to help them achieve or maintain a healthy weight.\u201d", "description": "Fat can accumulate in people\u2019s lungs and is particularly common in individuals who are overweight or obese, scientists have discovered for the first time.\u00a0 Fatty tissue in the walls of airways alters their normal structure\u00a0leading to inflammation\u00a0which could cause wheezing and asthma, the study suggests.", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/17/12/lungs-european-respiratory-journal.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
