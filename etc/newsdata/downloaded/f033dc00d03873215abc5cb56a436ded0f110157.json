He\u2019s got a big heart.\u201d\n\nFor de Klerk, the fact that he and slightly smaller winger Cheslin Kolbe (1.71m) have become integral parts of the South Africa team is a matter of great pride and, he hopes, an inspiration to youngsters.\n\n\u201cCheslin has been amazing for us ... it\u2019s great to see and it gives confidence to a lot of kids who might shy away because of their size,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf you have heart and you are willing to work hard you can reach your dreams. That\u2019s sometimes what I play for, to inspire people, especially young kids.\u201d\n\nOne aspect of de Klerk\u2019s game that was more problematic for Springbok fans desperate to see their backline unleashed was the frequency with which he went to the box kick in last weekend\u2019s quarter-final victory over Japan.\n\nDe Klerk conceded that South Africa do kick a lot but he did not see that changing much in Yokohama on Sunday against a Welsh side similarly fond of putting boot to ball.\n\n\u201cWe did kick a lot in the air and Japan managed to contain our aerial battle but we managed to get so much yardage,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think it was a very positive outcome on that. We gave them possession but they rarely managed to do anything with it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about seeing the space. I feel our wings have come so far these last two years and are competing so well in the air.\n\n\u201cThey have got some good wingers (too) so I think it\u2019s going to be a massive battle in the air.\u201d\n\nDe Klerk is becoming a bit of a cult hero in Japan and further afield with his ability to spin the ball on his finger in particular attracting plenty of new fans.\n\nHis dedication to kicking from hand has also inspired plenty of less adulatory comment online but one play on the Afrikaans word for kick (skop) and spider (spinnekop) particularly caught his fancy.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a nice funny picture where it says I can spin a ball and kick so is that a spinnekop?\u201d he said.", "description": "Faf de Klerk would make an unlikely Spiderman with his distinctive mane of blonde hair but the South Africa scrumhalf does share one trait with the fictional superhero as a small man who packs a big punch.", "authors": ["Nick Mulvenney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444043946&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0LI-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
