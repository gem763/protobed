We might be able to do infrared astronomy with the naked eye, or have night vision without bulky equipment.\"\n\nAccording to Popular Science, human vision usually operates within wavelengths between 380 to 700 nanometers. But in February, a paper authored Gang and fellow researchers at the University of Science and Technology of China described how they injected special \"ocular injectable photoreceptor-binding upconversion\" nanoparticles that absorb infrared light and produce visible (and therefore perceivable) light into the retinas of lab rats.\n\nThe result? The nanoparticles basically created \"thousands of tiny infrared goggles inside the rodents' eyes,\" as The Atlantic artfully explained at the time. \"With their technologically augmented retinas, the mice could respond to infrared light that would otherwise have been invisible to them.\"\n\nThis is obviously has fascinating applications beyond combat: As one expert told Stars and Stripes, the temporary nature of the treatment presents less of a risk to the average warfighter than permanent augmentations, and various nanoparticle designs could enable customs officials to detect \"smuggled radioactive materials\" by eyeball alone.\n\nBut despite these applications, it's still a f---ing needle to the eye. Am I the only person who actually learned anything from one of the greatest naval minds of the 24th century and his never-ending struggle against his bionic white whale?\n\nNo f---ing THANK you.\n\nLook, the Army's new Enhanced Night Vision Goggles (ENVG-III) are finally rolling out to soldiers after years in the works, and they only weigh 2 pounds tops. Call me a traditionalist, but I would much prefer an external headset to getting bunch of s--- jammed in my eye \u2014 or at least some badass contact lenses.", "description": "A group of researchers plan to present a method to inject nanoparticles into the eye to give a subject the ability to see near-infrared light.", "authors": ["Jared Keller", "Task"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/59808e48b50ab100028b5127?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
