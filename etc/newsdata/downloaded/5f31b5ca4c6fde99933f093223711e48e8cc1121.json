Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court after a heated set of hearings during which Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers. The Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly were two of the journalists who covered the hearings for the paper, and they have now written a book, \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh,\u201d which tells the story starting back in the 1980s.\n\nImage\n\nPogrebin and Kelly discuss the book on this week\u2019s podcast. Kelly says that the \u201cfoundational mission\u201d of the book was not just to learn more about the allegations against Kavanaugh but to get \u201ca much better context for who he was as a person and what his educational years and career were like, and who is the man who has been portrayed in these two starkly polarized ways.\u201d\n\nThe Australian novelist Tim Winton also appears on the podcast to discuss his most recent book, \u201cThe Shepherd\u2019s Hut.\u201d The interview was taped last month at the Edinburgh International Book Festival. In it, Winton talks about the novel and more generally about how he came to love and write about the natural world. \u201cI was very conscious, being a child, of having a preference for the outdoors over the indoors, because in the outdoors, you had agency,\u201d Winton says. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re a kid you don\u2019t have that much power \u2014 not in my childhood \u2014 and once you were outside, you could write the script, in a way.\u201d", "description": "Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly discuss their new book, and Tim Winton talks about his most recent novel, \u201cThe Shepherd\u2019s Hut.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/15/books/review/20podcast1/20podcast1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
