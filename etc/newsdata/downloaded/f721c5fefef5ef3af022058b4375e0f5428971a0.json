While we can\u2019t get to everything \u2014 like Lamar Jackson\u2019s continued development and Tom Brady\u2019s controversial Netflix cameo \u2014 here are five of the top storylines to emerge from the football week that was, and whether we\u2019re buying or selling on \u2019em.\n\nBuy: Jacoby Brissett was Tom Brady\u2019s best backup\n\nDuring Sunday\u2019s huge division win over his team\u2019s AFC South rival, Indianapolis Colts quarterback Jacoby Brissett completed 26-of-39 passes for 326 yards and four touchdowns.\n\nBrissett, who became the starter for the Colts by default when Andrew Luck shocked the world and retired on the eve of the 2019-2020 season, is playing the best ball of his career through the first six weeks of the season and bears little resemblance to the guy who went 4-11 as a starter while filling in for an injured Luck in 2017.\n\nPrior to the season, the Colts inked the 26-year-old QB to a two-year contract worth $30 million, and he\u2019s earned every penny of it thus far while leading Indy to a 4-2 record.\n\nA former backup to Tom Brady in New England, Brissett was never viewed in the same light as another Brady backup, Jimmy Garoppolo. But with both players now starting in the NFL (and Garoppolo being paid quite handsomely to do so), Brissett appears to have a little bit of an edge when you compare their stats.\n\n\n\nIn six games this season, Brissett has doubled up Jimmy G in touchdown passes (14 to 7) while throwing half as many interceptions (3 to 6).\n\nGaroppolo does have the edge in the most important statistic \u2014 wins \u2014 with the San Francisco 49ers sitting at 6-0. But Brissett has been the better of Brady\u2019s two backup-turned-starters so far this season.\n\nSell: The Bengals are better than the Miami Dolphins\n\nBy falling to the Jacksonville Jaguars 27-17 at home on Sunday, the Cincinnati Bengals became the first team in the NFL to lose seven games this season.\n\nThe Bengals, to their credit, have been competitive in a number of their games, but have struggled on both sides of the ball and currently have one of the worst point-differential marks in the league.\n\nIn Sunday\u2019s loss, quarterback Andy Dalton was downright awful and threw three picks in the span of five plays.\n\n\n\nGiven Dalton\u2019s declining performance and where Cincinnati sits in the standings, it\u2019s hard to make a case that the Bengals, despite their best efforts, are any better than the tanking Miami Dolphins and may ultimately find themselves in almost the same spot.\n\nThe Bengals do play five of their remaining nine games against teams with losing records (Browns, Dolphins, Steelers, Jets) but it\u2019s nearly impossible to imagine the team winning more than one of those games, two at the most.\n\nThat means Cincinnati will likely finish the season at 1-15 or 2-14, a record which would likely net them the top pick in next year\u2019s draft if the Dolphins weren\u2019t as bad as they are.\n\nAt 0-7, it may be time for the Bengals to take a look at rookie quarterback Ryan Finley and find out a way to trade Pro Bowl wide receiver A.J. Green, who has yet to play this season, for some assets they can use in the future.\n\nThe Bengals need to put themselves in play to have the opportunity to draft Tua Tagovailoa the same way the Dolphins are doing, because whether it\u2019s intentional or not, Cincinnati is in the same spot as Miami.\n\nBuy: The Chargers need to hit the reset button\n\nLosers of three in a row and five out of their last six, the Los Angeles Chargers are now 2-5 on the season and occupy the basement of the AFC West.\n\nAs they have for years, the Chargers keep finding new ways to lose at the end of games. On Sunday, it was star running back Melvin Gordon fumbling into the end zone with L.A. trailing by three points and needing a TD to take the lead.\n\nMelvin Gordon fumbles it on the goal line with 7 seconds left in the game.\n\n\n\nTitans win 23-20 and cover the -2.5.\n\npic.twitter.com/hn1tFRYSRY \u2014 Barstool Bets (@barstoolbets) October 20, 2019\n\nIncluding Gordon\u2019s game-ending fumble, the Chargers have turned the ball over five times in goal-to-go situations this season, tied for the most goal-to-go turnovers by a team in the past 15 seasons, per ESPN Stats & Info.\n\nThe fumble is emblematic of a Charger offense that has somehow lost its way in the red zone under longtime quarterback Philip Rivers.\n\nLast year, receiver Mike Williams totaled 11 touchdowns. He has yet to find the end zone in 2019. Williams is far from the only Charger who\u2019s struggling to find paydirt, with the Chargers somehow tied for 23rd in the NFL in scoring (20 points per game) while ranking third in the league in passing yardage (at nearly 300 yards per game).\n\nThe team\u2019s trouble with scoring touchdowns is just one big issue the Chargers, who haven\u2019t advanced past the divisional round of the playoffs in more than a decade, have traditionally had with sealing the deal.\n\nWith the trade deadline just two weeks away, it may be time for the Chargers to give some serious thought to altering the nucleus of their team by dealing away Gordon or another core player.\n\nWhether it\u2019s dealing Gordon or another piece, the Chargers, who went 12-4 last year, clearly need to do something, because their current path seems to be leading nowhere. Unfortunately for LA, that\u2019s familiar territory.\n\nBuy: The Falcons never recovered from losing the Super Bowl\n\nSince losing Super Bowl LI in historic fashion to the New England Patriots, the Atlanta Falcons have a combined record of 18-21. Now 1-6 this season following a 37-10 shellacking at the hands of a reeling Los Angeles Rams team that had lost three straight, the Falcons are all but done in the NFC South.\n\nA squad that made the Super Bowl just three seasons ago will now likely miss the playoffs for the second straight year: only one team in the Super Bowl era, the 1970 Cincinnati Bengals, started 1-6 and make the playoffs.\n\nIt\u2019s quite a fall from grace for a team that largely comprises the same players who were on the roster when Atlanta waltzed through the NFC and led New England 28\u20133 midway through the third quarter of the Super Bowl in 2017.\n\nOf course, the Patriots came back to win that game in overtime and, based on what has befallen the Falcons since then, it\u2019s fair to wonder if New England crushed the franchise\u2019s football soul in the process. This season, no team in the NFL has surrendered more points than the Falcons (223), and that\u2019s in a league that includes the 0-6 Dolphins, 0-7 Bengals and 1-6 Redskins.\n\nDefense is all about effort, and the Falcons, who\u2019ve given up more than 30 points in three straight games, have clearly stopped giving any under head coach Dan Quinn. The roots of that can be traced back to what happened beginning in the third quarter at NRG Stadium in Houston on February 5, 2017.\n\nBuy: Sam Darnold is fine, but not ready for prime time\n\nLast Sunday against the Dallas Cowboys, Sam Darnold completed 23-of-32 passes for 338 yards, two touchdowns and one pick in the Jets\u2019 upset win over the Cowboys.\n\nIn the win, Darnold looked good and seemed to revive offensive players who had gone dormant in his absence like Robby Anderson and Jamison Crowder.\n\nExpectations for what the 22-year-old would be able to do against New England\u2019s shutdown defense on Monday Night Football last night were tempered, but there was some optimism he\u2019d find success against the Patriots, since the Jets usually play their AFC East rivals tough at home.\n\nUnfortunately for Darnold, the home game turned into a house of horrors for him and the entire New York offense as they managed only 166 yards of offense while he threw four interceptions, fumbled, was forced to take a safety and finished with a dismal 3.6 quarterback rating.\n\n#Patriots get immediate pressure on Sam Darnold, Sam Darnold underthrows the pass and Stephon Gilmore picks it off! BEST CORNER IN THE GAME! pic.twitter.com/8Elmbk1CaH \u2014 PatriotsNation\u2122 (@PatsNationTM) October 22, 2019\n\nTerrence Brooks picks off Sam Darnold!!! Darnold's 4th INT of the game!!!!pic.twitter.com/lUT1zE2BAw \u2014 PatriotsNation\u2122 (@PatsNationTM) October 22, 2019\n\n\n\nTo make matters worse, Darnold was caught on camera saying he was \u201cseeing ghosts\u201d due to all the pressure the Patriots were putting on him.\n\nOh no Sam Darnold do not admit to \"seeing ghosts\" when you're mic'd up in prime time. pic.twitter.com/E0pukwhL4s \u2014 Will Brinson (@WillBrinson) October 22, 2019\n\n\n\nIn some ways, the ghosts comment should be even scarier for Jets fans than the awful turnover numbers, because it came in the first half and Darnold continued to play poorly after making it. That means Darnold and New York\u2019s coaching staff were unable to figure out a way to solve what he revealed to a national audience as an obvious problem.\n\nFor the No. 3 overall pick in last year\u2019s draft, it\u2019s not a promising development. Maybe Darnold will get there, but it\u2019s clear he isn\u2019t ready to lead the Jets into relevancy quite yet.", "description": "Here are five of the top storylines to emerge following the football week that was, and whether we\u2019re buying or selling on \u2019em.", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1182324139-e1571683228378.jpg?fit=872%2C581", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
