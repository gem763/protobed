It\u2019s the natural evolution of a baffling trend\n\nLove wearing a fleece but hate the thought of being five minutes away from a Starbucks? Prefer to observe your scenic views from the comfort of your computer? Then you will be into Snow Peak - the hipster Japanese outdoors shop that is coming to the UK. However, the clothes it sells are styled less for a leisurely ramble over a muddy munro and more for wearing in an ironically captioned selfie, looking a bit weather-worn.\n\n\u201cI wanted to create clothes that are functional, practical but also stylish,\u201d designer Lisa Yamai told Vogue. \u201cI wanted to make outdoor clothes that you wouldn\u2019t just wear at the weekend; clothes you could wear seven days a week, that will make the outdoors feel more familiar.\u201d\n\nEssentially, it is a very different look to the one you would pick up at your local branch of Blacks. Snow Peak is the natural destination for the urbanite who likes to wear a look that suggests they will be asking their nearest and dearest to sponsor a Himalayan hike very, very soon (but almost certainly not doing one).\n\nIt sells elevated, high-fashion fishing vests, \u201coutdoor kimonos\u201d and, yes, lots of fleeces. Its aesthetic is very much where utility-wear is now \u2013 where luxury meets usefulness and functionality is the new decoration.\n\nAs well as being big business (the UK\u2019s outdoor clothing market is valued at \u00a3604m and has increased by 22% between 2013 and 2017), luxe shops such as Snow Peak are the bricks-and-mortar endpoint of \u201cgorpcore\u201d, the trend of wearing lots of Patagonia and North Face, alongside your normal jeans and New Balance.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Great outdoors \u2026 shoppers at Snow Peak.\n\nAlthough the term was coined by the Cut in 2017, it still feels significant in the era of Generation Greta. It is a style that semaphores a healthy and clear objective. \u201cClothing that fits a purpose and does what it says will always be relevant to men,\u201d Nick Paget, the senior menswear editor at trend-forecasting agency WGSN, said at the time.\n\nBut like the power gilet in Succession, the look is also a humble power brag, a sartorial, ever-so-slightly judgey bit of virtue signalling: about being your most Bear Grylls-ish self.\n\nThink of the Jesus Is King -era Kanye West posing in the wilds of his Wyoming farm or Richard Madden on the cover of Interview magazine looking like he is just having a tea break after a spot of drywalling.\n\nA recent New York Times headline about warcore, the gorier sequel to gorpcore, squealed: \u201cIf you can get killed doing it, fashion wants it\u201d.
