While you enjoy the festivities with your family and friends, you should also keep in mind certain points regarding how you should keep yourselves safe this Diwali. Especially, when you are lighting firecrackers. Follow these basic dos and don\u2019ts:\n\nEmergency numbers\n\nIf you fall sick or if any member of your family or friend sustains burn injuries while lighting firecrackers, you need to visit the nearest hospital as soon as possible - any delay can be fatal. Keep emergency hospital, ambulance and police numbers ready. Keeping such information handy will help you act faster.\n\nWash with water\n\nMake sure that you are closer to water sources in your house or residential complex while lighting firecrackers. If a splinter or anything hot gets into your eyes, immediately clean with lots of water. Remember you should only use clean water for your eyes. You can use ice for cold compress as well.\n\nClothes matter\n\nPlease wear cotton clothes while lighting firecrackers. Do not wear loose clothes that can hover over the crackers. Make sure that everyone who\u2019s lighting crackers with you wear cotton clothes.\n\nKeep kids safe\n\nIdeally, you shouldn\u2019t let children burst crackers. If they need to do that, adults should be present in the area. Give kids safe firecrackers, nothing complicated.\n\nSpecs over lenses\n\nDon\u2019t wear lenses, stick to plain spectacles. Experts say that contact lenses may cause irritation to the eyes if exposed to high heat for a significant stretch of time. Also, while lighting firecrackers, do not bend too much over them. Maintain a safe distance between your face and the crackers.\n\nHave a pet-friendly Diwali\n\nIf you have pets in your house, you should be extra cautious. If they are scared of firecrackers, keep them in a safe area where the noise can\u2019t reach them. Keep your pets away from toxic fumes. Do not have them around while lighting firecrackers.
