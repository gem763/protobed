Death Stranding, the long-awaited first game from Hideo Kojima after his split from Konami, is on its way. And with each new trailer, we see that Stranding will include the same crazy bullshit we\u2019ve come to expect from a Kojima production: a script heavy with exposition, on-the-nose names and titles ripped straight from a twelve-year-old\u2019s first sci-fi story, and a heavy dose of the supernatural. If nothing else, it looks to be a typical Hideo Kojima game. But these trailers also provide a timely reminder that Death Stranding will face heavy scrutiny upon its release. Included in the release date reveal trailer is a scene in which a presumed antagonist licks L\u00e9a Seydoux\u2019s face. Compared to what Kojima usually puts his women through, this is somewhat tame. However, it is a reminder of his long history of uncomfortable depictions of women in his narratives \u2014 his reliance on tired sexist tropes and an unapologetic implementation of women as visual rewards for his perceived male player base. And given Death Stranding\u2019s stark resemblance to The Phantom Pain, there is a justified concern that it will be more of the same. Gender disparity in context The gaming landscape has always skewed male. In recent years, the number of women and men playing games has leveled out, but it is still the case that the development side of gaming is overwhelmingly male \u2014 the most recent investigation into gender in gaming revealed that 88 percent of game developers are men. Female-led games still suffer from being undermined and under-marketed, while women in the industry will tell you that Gamergate did not happen in a vacuum and was rather the most visible example of the systematic abuse that women are subjected to in the industry. In Quiet, Kojima has created what he likely wanted to all along: a silent mannequin for men\u2019s enjoyment \u2014 you can even paint her if you want. The range of rewards offered in the first Metroid game. Image source: Game Planet. In the late 1980s, the damsel-in-distress adventure was the typical gaming formula. The two most popular games of the time, Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda relied heavily on the trope \u2014 and continue to do so \u2014 and the majority of releases throughout the life-cycles of the NES and SNES depended on a male hero with a woman at the end of his journey. So the revelation that Samus Aran, the protagonist of Metroid, was a woman had the potential to be groundbreaking. That one of the coolest characters in gaming \u2014 and what child of the \u201880s, fresh off Star Wars, thought space bounty hunters weren\u2019t cool? \u2014 was female represented an incredible marketing tool to open up an industry almost exclusively marketed at boys to girls and women. Yet, Samus was never supposed to be female. All the marketing and even the instruction booklet refer to Samus as he and him, and the reveal that Samus is a woman wasn\u2019t made with representation and demographics in mind. Rather, it was conceived as a reward for its male players. While completing the game in five hours sees Samus remove her helmet and thus reveals her identity, this powerful moment is undermined by anyone who finishes in three hours which sees her don a skin-tight leotard like something out of GLOW. Finishing the game in one hour reveals the same image, except Samus is now decked in a bikini. This use of Samus in revealing costume as a reward for finishing the game continued in Metroid II and Super Metroid, all the way up to Super Smash Bros. for the Wii U, which had director Masahiro Sakurai declaring, \u201cAnd here\u2019s Samus in shorts!\u201d The almost exclusive representation of women as sexual trophies has become foundational in gaming. Kojima\u2019s ever-intensifying treatment of women as sexual objects and prizes, be it Meryl, Eva, or Quiet, is a continuation of the tired and restrictive tropes present in those early days of the games industry. And while Japan has been slower than most to move away from traditional gender biases (in 2019, represents an embarrassingly feudal attitude to the roles of men and women in society), this does not excuse creators \u2014 whether they\u2019re Japanese or not \u2014 for maintaining these tropes, whether it\u2019s Kojima decking a character in a bikini or Shigeru Miyamoto hijacking an entire game to convert it into a furry damsel-in-distress nightmare. Japanese companies may not face the same backlash for sexist tropes that western companies now do, but that does not make their reliance on exploitative tropes less unsettling, and sets a worrying precedent for the treatment of women in a context where they face continued harassment and violence both within and outside the gaming industry. Tentative steps forward Jill Valentine, the protagonist of Capcom\u2019s Resident Evil, is arguably one of the first meaningful female player-characters in gaming. Easily on par with her male colleagues, she is not defined by her clothing but rather by her skillset. The recent Resident Evil 2 remake has continued this trend with Claire Redfield, who is narratively better-equipped (both physically and mentally) to deal with the infestation of Raccoon City than her male counterpart. It is a major fillip in such a long-running series that so many of its female characters are demarcated by what they do and not what they wear.\n\nImage source: Wallpaper Abyss.\n\nThat being said, Resident Evil is no stranger to using its female characters as a rewards system. Though \u2014 for the most part \u2014 appropriately dressed in their base games, completion bonuses always deck Resident Evil\u2019s women in sexually suggestive attire designed for male titillation. This goes a long way to undermining the representation of women in Resident Evil\u2019s games. In fact, for a time Capcom seemed to regress, with Resident Evil 4 relying on an old-school damsel-in-distress storyline and Resident Evil 5 leaning into negative (and sexual) stereotypes. Even Resident Evil 2, which has made a point of being more grounded in reality, puts Leon in a wealth of ordinary clothing while Claire\u2019s bonus costumes focus on a more bedraggled and revealing theme. Women as rewards This concept of using women as a reward is not confined to video games. Throughout media, a dangerous precedent is maintained which sees women depicted as attainable objects rather than genuine characters. Masamitsu Hidaka, show-runner of the Pok\u00e9mon anime, had this to say on the high turnaround of female characters in the series: \u201cIt gives boys some new eye-candy every once in a while\u2026 girls are more customizable and you can change their outfits, like when they are in bathing suits.\u201d This in itself is a troubling sentiment, but when you consider that he is referring to characters whose ages range between ten and thirteen it becomes downright creepy. And while the intent may be for ten to thirteen-year-olds to watch the series, it is important to remember that the creators behind these sexually-driven characters, controlling their behavior and clothing, are adult men.

Every single example of women being used as a rewards system for male players \u2014 whether it\u2019s Mario receiving a kiss on the cheek or sex in return for rescue in The Witcher 2 \u2014 communicates the idea that women are fundamentally there for male amusement. And as more women populate the roles of player, developer, and journalist these games perpetuate the attitudes that make the industry a consistently dangerous place for women to be. Kojima\u2019s women Hideo Kojima has played a prominent role in this broader story. His continuing and, frankly, intensifying use of women as objects has colored the Metal Gear Solid series as a hub of sexist tropes; permeated with women in prominent roles being designed with male titillation in mind, culminating in the blatant and unapologetic sexualization of Quiet in Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. As early as Metal Gear Solid, and its GameCube remake Twin Snakes, the principal female character is used for little more than male players\u2019 enjoyment. Early in the game, Snake can snoop from a ceiling vent at Meryl Silverberg exercising in her underwear. Later, while Snake is looking for a disguised Meryl among the faceless guards littering the game, the clue to her identity is the exaggerated way she wiggles her hips as she walks. And once you find her, she\u2019ll run to the bathroom, where enterprising creeps can catch her in the middle of changing if they\u2019re fast enough. Much like the characters of Resident Evil, Meryl is capable and, for the most part, appropriately dressed. But these moments of forced nudity, meant only as a reward for creepy players, completely undermine that identity. It would be easy to dismiss this as a product of the times \u2014 the original Metal Gear Solid was released in 1998 \u2014 but to do so would be irresponsible. As Anita Sarkeesian related in her Women as Reward video, these aren\u2019t \u201caccidents or glitches, they\u2019re intentionally put into the game by the designers and, as a result, indicate the value that the designers, themselves, place on these female characters.\u201d Kojima\u2019s defenders might rely on the argument that his games hark back to \u201880s action movies and these tropes are simply a part of that, but that fails to lay accountability where it belongs and empowers developers like Kojima to do it all again. Which he did in Metal Gear Solid 3, in which Eva \u2014 in a demonstration of Kojima\u2019s often incomprehensible writing \u2014 is a triple agent who has infiltrated antagonist Volgin\u2019s organization (ostensibly by sleeping with him) but is also in contact with you and the Chinese, all while doing flips on a motorbike and \u2014 you know what? It\u2019s best not to try and understand what\u2019s going on in Metal Gear Solid 3. All of this is achieved while wearing a flight suit unzipped to her waist, showing off her cleavage \u2014 a view the game encourages you to take in with its R1 zoom feature. This is later compounded when guiding an injured Eva out of the game\u2019s signature jungle. Do so unscathed and you\u2019re rewarded with Eva in her underwear. In Metal Gear Solid 4, Kojima continues his use of interactive cutscenes which allow you to tactically zoom in on cleavage, jiggle a character\u2019s breasts by shaking your controller, and look up a character\u2019s skirt when she picks up a cigarette Snake dropped totally by accident. Move on to Peace Walker and the same mechanic provides a view up sixteen-year-old Paz\u2019s skirt. Then, in a game that does not utilize fully-rendered cutscenes, Paz gets the only one and she just happens to be in her underwear throughout. Which all leads to 2015\u2019s Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. There\u2019s no nudity as reward here; you don\u2019t have to do anything for it \u2014 you don\u2019t have to complete the game, or a series of challenges, or anything. Quiet is just there in a bikini, for no reason.\n\nImage source: The Verge.", "description": "", "authors": ["Super Jump Magazine"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FWhat-time-is-it_-6.png&signature=5bb3e81b99eeb4e518c332bcc895de6d", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
