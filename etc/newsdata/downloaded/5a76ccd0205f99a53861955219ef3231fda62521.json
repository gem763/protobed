We've opted for crusty over crustie but it's really up to you.\n\nThe term became popular in the nineties to refer to a particular group of people who dressed and behaved in a certain way.\n\nSo popular in fact the Oxford English Dictionary included it in its 1997 edition.\n\nThe full definition was: \"A group of homeless or vagrant young people, generally living by begging in cities, and characterized by rough clothes, matted, often dreadlocked hair, and an unkempt appearance. Also the name given to the sub-culture as a whole.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Crusties loved a free party in the nineties until they all got shut down.\n\nYes, there was definitely a look that defined the crusty.\n\nBen Osborne wrote the book The A-Z of Club Culture in 1999 - \"Crusty\" is in there - under C of course.\n\n\"The typical crusty was probably dreadlocked,\" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.\n\n\"The big clich\u00e9 was that they would have a dog on a string somewhere, and there was an association with the traveller scene.\"\n\nLook no further than the band the Levellers for some nineties crusty inspiration.\n\nEnvironmentalists\n\nBut it wasn't just about how many holes you had in your jumper, being a crusty was a way of life.\n\nFiona McPherson, senior editor with the Oxford English Dictionary, says the term originated from the Crust Rock music scene of the 1980s.\n\n\"They talked about political issues and animal rights and environmental issues.\"\n\nAnd writer Ben Osborne agrees the definition of a crusty was so much more than a look.\n\n\"It was somebody who rejected the overall lifestyle of society and started to live an alternative lifestyle,\" he says.\n\n\"The term came about because the idea was these people living this hippyish traveller lifestyle weren't getting access to having a bath.\"\n\nInstead of bathing many were campaigning and protesting.\n\nThere was one man in particular who became the poster boy for crusty culture and his name was Swampy.\n\nHe chained himself to trees and lived in underground tunnels in a bid to stop new roads being built, all while sporting dreadlocks and a holey jumper of course.\n\nImage copyright PA Media Image caption Swampy loved two things: Planet Earth and jumpers with holes in.\n\nCrusty comeback?\n\nSo fast forward to twenty or so years later - could Boris Johnson's comments mean the term crusty could make a comeback?\n\nFiona McPherson from the Oxford English Dictionary thinks so.\n\n\"It is perfectly possible. It's about recognition,\" she says. \"If you hear a word you haven't heard before whose to say that might make people start using it again.\"\n\nAmong the Extinction Rebellion protestors, it seems unlikely. For every set of baggy clothes and dreadlocks you're likely to find a corresponding retired geography teacher, vicar or young hairdresser in her gym wear.\n\nBen Osborne certainly thinks this latest movement spreads much wider than the crusties of the nineties.\n\n\"If you look at the people involved in Extinction Rebellion. It's got so many different people and such wide appeal. To identify them all as one kind of person is a bit strange.\"\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.", "description": "What the prime minister meant when he called climate change protestors 'uncooperative crusties'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/DCEA/production/_109145565_crusties90s.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
