He told 9News that this was the first time he\u2019d seen something of this calibre in his time on Airbnb.\n\n\u201cWe have [had] a few bad guests, but nothing like that.\u201d\n\nThe 21-year-old culprit rented the property under a fake name, claiming he was coming to Melbourne for a wedding with his girlfriend. But in reality, he rented out the property, then charged guests to attend the party.\n\n\u201cHow could someone give the wrong picture, wrong name and get into your property for a few hundred dollars \u2026 and then charge $10 to his own guests for a party?\u201d Gilbert said.\n\nAirbnb have come out saying they have a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy for bad behaviour and have permanently removed the account from the platform. But unfortunately it looks like somehow a dodgy user has slipped through the cracks of the policy.\n\n\u201cWe have absolutely zero tolerance for bad behaviour and enforce strict policies to protect our hosts, guests and the wider community,\u201d a spokesperson told WA Today. \u201cWe have removed the bad actors from our platform and stand ready to assist WA Police to ensure they are held to account.\n\nThankfully, Airbnb has also said that the host is fully covered under their Host Guarantee program that protects users from these sorts of incidents.\n\n\u201cWe will also fully support our host through our Host Guarantee.\u201d\n\nLuckily, the renter has apologised for throwing the party at Gilbert\u2019s property and has promised to pay for all of the costs associated with clean-up.\n\nIf you\u2019re renting an Airbnb or any type of holiday home, maybe don\u2019t trash the place by throwing a party for 200 people.\n\nNo charges have been laid at this point, but under Western Australian law, throwing an out of control party can cost you up to $12,000 in fines and possibly a year in jail.", "description": "An Airbnb host has been left with a trashed property after a dodgy guest hired the property under a false name to host a party for 200 people.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-956747406-1024x683.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
