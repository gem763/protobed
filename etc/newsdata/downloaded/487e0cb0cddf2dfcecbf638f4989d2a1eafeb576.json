His fortunes could rise after a smart, strong performance.\n\nThe Indiana native went on the offensive, attacking Warren on health care, O'Rourke for seeking to seize private citizens' guns, and fellow veteran Tulsi Gabbard for supporting Trump's Syria troop withdrawal.\n\nThroughout he appeared eager to prevent Democrats from shifting too far leftward in support of policies that may not play well in middle America, such as the Warren-backed universal health care proposal known as Medicare for All.\n\nKlobuchar delivered a solid performance as another Midwest pragmatist who, while still progressive on social issues, suggested a \"reality check\" against Warren liberalism.\n\n\"I want to win those states that we lost last time, and I have bold ideas to get us there.\"\n\n- Bernie bouncing back? -\n\nThe grumpy darling of the far left suffered a mild heart attack this month, understandably raising questions about his health.\n\nBut he appeared energized onstage, joking with moderators and pronouncing himself healthy. \"I'm feeling great,\" he said, insisting he will be mounting a \"vigorous campaign\" over the coming months.\n\nPolling numbers for Sanders have slumped and he trails Warren and Biden, but he remains a formidable force in the race, having outraised all rivals in the third quarter.\n\nDuring the debate US media reported Sanders won the endorsement of popular congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and fellow liberals Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib.\n\nSanders announced he is returning to the campaign trail with a major rally this weekend in New York.", "description": "An ascendant Elizabeth Warren seized the spotlight and faced repeated attacks in Tuesday's Democratic debate as Joe Biden often faded into the background, highlighting a shakeup in the 2020 nomination race.
