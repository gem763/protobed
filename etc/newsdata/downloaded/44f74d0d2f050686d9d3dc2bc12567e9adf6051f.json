(Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nBy many measures, George Washington University looks healthy. The largest school in the nation\u2019s capital boasts growing enrollment, solid finances, expanding research prowess and robust demand for programs such as politics and international affairs.\n\nYet GWU is taking a surprising and radical step that has prompted deep faculty anxiety: It is choosing to shrink \u2014 a lot.\n\nOver the next five years, the private university just west of the White House aims to slash the undergraduate population of its D.C. campuses 20 percent. That would mean 2,100 fewer students, less tuition revenue and tough choices on whether to reduce faculty and financial aid or find other ways to balance the budget.\n\nMany colleges have scrambled in recent times to cope with falling enrollment amiddemographic upheaval. GWU provides the rare case of a school announcing in advance, as a public strategy, that it wants to get smaller.\n\nGWU President Thomas J. LeBlanc, in his third year, said he wants to improve the academic, residential and social experience for students who too often encounter obstacles in university services. He also wants to expand programs in science, technology, engineering and math. The board of trustees has endorsed the enrollment shift, LeBlanc said. Now is the time, he said, for a pivot.\n\n\u201cWe are poised to take proactive and bold action,\u201d he said in a campus speech Thursday.\n\n\n\nThomas J. LeBlanc, 17th president of George Washington University. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nLeBlanc declined to rule out faculty layoffs or other significant steps to reduce expenditures. He said those issues will be hashed out in consultation with faculty, trustees and others in the development of a strategic plan.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I should be ruling out anything in the planning process,\u201d he told The Washington Post in a recent interview.\n\nSkepticism is building among faculty who fear changes will curtail access to a university that has sought mightily in recent years to ditch a reputation it had acquired as a high-priced destination catering to the wealthy. Some wonder how and why LeBlanc chose a 20 percent enrollment cut instead of a smaller target.\n\n\u201cHow do we make up for the lost revenue?\u201d asked Harald W. Griesshammer, an associate professor of physics. Rising tuition, coupled with rollbacks in financial aid, would make the university less racially and economically diverse, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the image GW has been fighting.\u201d\n\nTuition, fees, room and board this year total more than $71,000. Starting next year, the university is abandoning a long-standing policy of guaranteeing incoming students a fixed tuition rate until they graduate.\n\nThe GW Hatchet student news outlet wrote in an editorial this month that the university must explain how the new tuition policy will affect prospective students.\n\n\u201cFor many students considering where to attend college, price is the biggest determinant,\u201d the editorial said. \u201cFor middle-class families that might not be eligible for much financial aid, the prospect of steadily rising tuition across four years could be daunting.\u201d\n\nWhat GWU called a plan to \u201cright-size,\u201d disclosed on July 9, startled many in higher education. Experts say it is not unheard of for a major university to choose to shrink, but the scope of GWU\u2019s move was highly unusual.\n\nAmong about 60 private universities with high research activity, most were stable or grew from 2013 to 2018. Only a few shed as much as a tenth of their undergraduates in that time, federal data show. Among them were Emory, Catholic and Howard universities.\n\nSchools throughout the country are grappling with a volatile market. Public Virginia Tech, with a surprise overflow of more than 1,000 freshmen, turned hotels into makeshift dormitories this summer to squeeze them in. But private Bucknell University in Pennsylvania, Ithaca College in New York and numerous others fell short of targets.\n\nBucknell President John Bravman said his school was caught off guard when the usual stream of enrollment commitments dried up a few days before the May 1 deadline. \u201cThe spigot just turned off,\u201d he said this month at a meeting of college presidents in Washington.\n\nStudent shortages often pose an existential threat. \u201cThe vast majority of colleges don\u2019t worry about selectivity,\u201d Brian C. Rosenberg, president of Macalester College in Minnesota, said at the gathering. \u201cThey worry about filling their classes.\u201d\n\nAmid that uncertainty, analysts say GWU could be positioning itself to weather ups and downs in the market.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re making a strategic choice from a position of strength, answering the question, \u2018What size do we want to be?\u2019 \u201d said Dennis M. Gephardt, an analyst with the bond credit rating business Moody\u2019s Investors Service. \u201cThey\u2019re not doing it suddenly. They\u2019re doing it gradually.\u201d\n\nFounded in 1821, GWU has rising ambition as it nears its bicentennial.\n\nWith about 28,000 students \u2014 counting graduate, undergraduate, online and professional programs \u2014 GWU is nearly 50 percent larger than Georgetown University. The Jesuit neighbor, a little more than a mile away, has 19,000 students.\n\nGWU ranks 70th on the U.S. News & World Report list of national universities, tied with Clemson and Texas A&M universities and the University of Minnesota. Its Foggy Bottom campus, a bustling academic hub near the State Department and World Bank, makes GWU a magnet for scholars in public policy and social sciences. In that respect, it resembles in some ways the profile of higher-ranked Georgetown.\n\nBut in recent years GWU has enlarged its footprint in science and engineering to compete with private urban research centers such as Boston University, the University of Southern California and the University of Miami \u2014 where LeBlanc, a computer scientist, worked until GWU hired him in 2017.\n\nAt the same time, GWU has sought to draw more students of color and from low- to moderate-income families. In 2015, the university dropped a requirement for ACT or SAT scores, becoming one of the most prominent universities to go test-optional. Officials depicted the shift as a way to broaden outreach to underrepresented groups.\n\n[A shake-up in admissions: U-Chicago drops SAT/ACT testing requirement]\n\nThe share of undergraduates at GWU who are Hispanic rose to 10 percent in fall 2018, federal data show, up from 7 percent five years earlier. There were also modest gains among Asian American, multiracial and international students. The African American share remained unchanged at 7 percent.\n\nThe share with enough financial need to qualify for federal Pell grants was about 14 percent in 2017-2018 \u2014 little changed from recent past years.\n\nThe new enrollment strategy arose, LeBlanc said, through conversations about how students are served.\n\nLeBlanc said he has heard repeatedly from students and alumni about courses that fill up, housing that needs renovation \u2014 especially 1,100-bed, nine-story Thurston Hall \u2014 and basic services that are uneven.\n\n\n\nGWU\u2019s Thurston Hall dormitory is scheduled to be renovated. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cWe want to be preeminent,\u201d he said, \u201cand we want to be preeminent in not only the faculty experience here, but the student experience here, the alumni experience, the parent experience. We\u2019re going to work on all those things. So when I see something that isn\u2019t up to the preeminent standard, I think we ought to fix it.\u201d\n\nThe fix, he said, must include a lower undergraduate head count. He cited a famously exclusive university to underscore the point. \u201cHarvard\u2019s in the quality business,\u201d LeBlanc said. \u201cThey\u2019re not in the quantity business. GW should be in the quality business, too.\u201d\n\nSarah Roach, editor in chief of the GW Hatchet, said she has heard occasional student complaints about service delays at the student health center or financial aid office. Last year, she recalled, a larger-than-expected freshman class forced a housing scramble. But Roach, 20, a junior from Massachusetts, said she has not observed a major revolt over university services. Many students seem more animated, she said, about whether the university should change its athletic nickname \u2014 the Colonials \u2014 than whether it should get smaller. \u201cI\u2019ve heard no conversations about the reduction in enrollment,\u201d she said.\n\nFederal data show the university had about 12,500 undergraduates last fall, 21 percent more than five years earlier. But those figures include online students and those at a science and technology campus in Ashburn, Va., home to a school of nursing.\n\nFor the enrollment cut, LeBlanc is focusing on the Foggy Bottom and Mount Vernon campuses that serve about 10,500 undergraduates in the District. He said he wants to bring the total to 8,400.\n\nIn the past five years, LeBlanc said, the university added about 1,000 undergraduates through a merger with a local art college, improved student retention and a push for revenue to offset a temporary decline in graduate enrollment. Now, he wants to roll back twice that number, while also expanding the share who major in science, technology, engineering and math fields. About 19 percent major in those fields (often as a double major); LeBlanc\u2019s goal is 30 percent.\n\nSylvia Marotta-Walters, a counseling psychologist who chairs the Faculty Senate\u2019s executive committee, said it is \u201ca smart move to create the community that you want purposefully rather than to just allow it to grow with no purpose in mind.\u201d\n\nOthers worry the changes will reshape a school reliant on tuition revenue.\n\n\u201cA lot of us are nervous, especially those of us in the humanities,\u201d said Katrin Schultheiss, who chairs the history department. She said faculty are sympathetic to trimming enrollment, if that means smaller classes and better student service. But she said the plan for a 20 percent cut could take a deep bite out of revenue. Reducing financial aid in a significant way, she said, \u201cwould have a terrible effect on the student body.\u201d\n\nSteven Knapp, LeBlanc\u2019s predecessor, who remains on the faculty, sought during his decade as president to make GWU more accessible to a wider range of students.\n\n\u201cMy successor is in the best position to say how his administration plans to pay for a reduction in undergraduate enrollment,\u201d Knapp said, \u201cbut I trust that it continues to share the commitment to diversity, affordability and student success that guided our efforts during the years of my administration.\u201d\n\nAbout half of GWU students receive aid to address financial need. Others receive merit scholarships that are not tied to family wealth or income. On average, these grants and scholarships provide a discount of about 42 percent from the sticker price for undergraduate tuition and fees. LeBlanc indicated he is considering a reduction of that discount rate. \u201cOne of the variables we should look into,\u201d he said.\n\nLeBlanc dismissed a suggestion that his motive is to engineer a climb in national rankings.\n\n\u201cWe are in a position where we have the luxury of time to think carefully about what kind of university we want to be,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not responding to an external crisis where overnight all the applications nationally collapsed. We\u2019re not responding to anything other than our desire to be better and to provide a better experience to our students.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe president of George Washington University wants to reduce undergraduate enrollment from the current 10,500 to 8,400.
