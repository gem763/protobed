When we compare Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, we hardly think of Neymar in the same vein. But truth be told, maybe the man does not always get the credit he deserves.\n\nAFP\n\nYes, his antics on and off the pitch are not exactly popular with everyone but one cannot deny him due credit and even the stats back him up. So where does he have an edge over Ronaldo and Messi?\n\nAFP\n\nWell he has recently completed 100 international caps. The man has scored 61 goals, not to mention 41 assists. In other words he has been involved in 102 goals.
