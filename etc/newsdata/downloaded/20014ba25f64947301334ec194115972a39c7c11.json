But having the limitations and the pain is not allowing me to enjoy competing or training,\u201d he said, later revealing that even walking his dog had become a gruelling ordeal.\n\nTributes flowed for the well-liked Scot, with Billie Jean King called him \u201ca champion on and off court\u201d.\n\nPlayers also farewelled him in an emotional video screened on centre court after he lost an epic five-setter to Roberto Bautista Agut, with most believing his Grand Slam career was over.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very sad that you have to take that position, but sometimes life is not perfect,\u201d Rafael Nadal said. \u201cI just want to say thanks for the things that you gave to our sport.\u201d\n\nBut the match against Bautista Agut rekindled Murray\u2019s competitive spark and he opted to fight on and undergo hip resurfacing surgery.\n\nAmerican doubles legend Bob Bryan had endured the procedure \u2014 which involves inserting an artificial hip implant with a rod that goes right down to the femur \u2014 and warned Murray there would be no easy road back.\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s ever come back with this surgery on the singles court,\u201d he said at the time, adding that if anyone could do it a renowned fighter like Murray was prime candidate.\n\nMurray said after his win over Londero that his movement on the court felt like it was steadily improving.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning I didn\u2019t necessarily feel good, but last couple of weeks have been I think much improved,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 2013, Murray became the first British man to win Wimbledon for 77 years, ending the nation\u2019s obsession with finding a champion to follow in the footsteps of Fred Perry.\n\nHe repeated the feat in 2016, adding to a glittering career that also includes the 2012 US Open, two Olympic gold medals and 45 ATP crowns.\n\nAustralian Open organisers hope there will be another blast from the past if Belgium\u2019s Kim Clijsters can meet her goal of taking to the court again in January after an absence of more than seven years.\n\nA crowd favourite in Melbourne, the 36-year-old retired to have a family but made a surprise announcement last month that she was making a comeback in 2020.\n\nClijsters has won four Grand Slams, including the 2011 Australian Open.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Andy Murray will make his Grand Slam return at the Australian Open in January, a year after career-saving hip surgery, tournament organisers announced Tuesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ANDYMURRAY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
