Al Baghdadi changed his places of residence very often. He was about to move to a new place in Jerablus [on the border with Turkey].\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cOur own source, who had been able to reach Al Baghdadi, brought Al Baghdadi\u2019s underwear to conduct a DNA test and make sure (100%) that the person in question was Al Baghdadi himself.\u201d\n\nVisual guide to the raid that killed Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Read more\n\nTrump has claimed credit for masterminding the operation that led to Baghdadi\u2019s death, but according to the SDF version, his withdrawal of US forces led to a postponement of the operation.\n\n\u201cMore than a month ago, the decision was made to eliminate Al Baghdadi. However, the US withdrawal and the Turkish invasion prompted us to stop our special operations, including the pursuit of Al Baghdadi. The Turkish invasion caused a delay in the operation,\u201d Can said.\n\n\u201cOur intelligence source was involved in sending coordinates, directing the airdrop, participating in and making the operation a success until the last minute.\u201d\n\nThe SDF commander, General Mazloum Kobani, also referred to a SDF-run spy in Baghdadi\u2019s entourage in interviews with US media on Monday.\n\nAsked about the SDF role in the operation in Idlib province late on Saturday night, the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, General Mark Milley, gave a carefully-worded reply, saying he was \u201cnot going to comment on what may or may not have happened with the SDF\u201d but stressing that the air operation and the soldiers sent into the compound were exclusively US special forces.\n\nMazloum told NBC that the SDF agent was at the Baghdadi compound when the assault took place, that he had served as a security adviser to the Isis leader and that his betrayal was motivated by revenge.\n\nThe husband of Baghdadi\u2019s sister-in-law has emerged as another key figures earlier on in the hunt for the Isis leader. According to Iraqi intelligence officials, Muhammad Ali Sajid al-Zobaie led them to a desert tunnel on the Iraqi Syrian border, where items linked to the Isis leader were found. The Iraqis say they found a weapon, medical bags, religious books and a small handbag containing maps and hand-drawn locations inside the cache.\n\n'He died as he lived \u2013 a coward': Isis victims' relatives on Baghdadi's death Read more\n\nFrom that starting point, the smuggler who proved central to the hunt was located, as was one of Baghdadi\u2019s wives and a nephew. All three were co-opted, and they led Iraqis and Syrian Kurds who had then been enlisted by the CIA to northern Idlib province, near an area called Jebel al-Druze in the beginning of September.\n\nBaghdadi is thought to have not long been in the province and was regularly moving between a series of simple houses.\n\nIn a Pentagon briefing Milley gave few new details about the Saturday raid on a compound near the Syrian-Turkish border which led to Baghdadi\u2019s death when he detonated a suicide vest in a tunnel.\n\n\u201cBaghdadi\u2019s remains were then transported to a secure facility to confirm his identity with forensic DNA testing, and the disposal of his remains has been done, and is complete, and was handled appropriately,\u201d Milley said. Another Pentagon official confirmed that Baghdadi\u2019s body was buried at sea at an unnamed location, similar to the 2011 sea burial of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden after he was killed in a US special forces raid in Pakistan.\n\nHe said that two men had been captured alive at the compound and were in US custody in an unspecified location.\n\nMilley said he could not confirm Trump\u2019s claim that Baghdadi had been \u201cwhimpering and crying\u201d as he fled US forces in a tunnel at the compound.\n\n\u201cThe president had planned a talk down to the unit and unit members,\u201d the general said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the source of that was, but I assume it was talking directly to unit.\u201d", "description": "Syrian Democratic Forces also claim they played a key role in tracking down Baghdadi to a compound in northern Syria", "authors": ["Julian Borger", "Martin Chulov"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/080acb96a49883a874b62a562f1bbfb7eaf67dce/0_331_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d5a3e676a73904254e429786ed9d6afb", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
