The pair crashed hard onto the floor.\n\nFrom videos shot by fans in the crowd, it appears that Gaga hit the floor, and the fan ended up crashing down on top of her as the shocked audience gasped and screamed.\n\nwhy did the spotlight follow them i'm crying \ud83d\ude2d pic.twitter.com/4cuxovvkHr \u2014 Lady Gaga Facts (@LGMonsterFacts) October 18, 2019\n\nThe shocking accident was caught from multiple angles, the man appears to have simply tripped and stumbled, not realizing how close to the edge of the stage he actually was.\n\nIt's also seems that the fall would have almost certainly hurt either Gaga, the fan, or both.\n\nLady Gaga had an unfortunate fall off the stage tonight at Enigma after a fan picked her up and tripped.\n\n\n\nGaga crashed down first with the fan falling on top of her. She got right back up and continued the show.
