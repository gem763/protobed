Many boomers are opting to refinance their mortgages, lowering their monthly payments, and ultimately saving money over the longer term. With interest rates dropping, it\u2019s fair to say that the mortgage industry is itself experiencing a \u201crefi boom.\u201d\n\nYet the millennial generation is notably absent from taking advantage of this opportunity. According to loan consultants at the mortgage specialty firm that I lead, many millennials don\u2019t have the funds to cover the costs of refinancing their mortgages. Therefore, they can\u2019t benefit from the lower rates \u2014 which is unfortunate because young Americans are most in need of debt relief.\n\nFirst, the data. Most millennials don\u2019t earn as much as older Americans do. We examined the demographics of our customers and found that millennials represent a greater percentage of our customers who are in the lower income segment: 42.7% are millennials making $50,000 to $75,000 per year, while 38% are millennials earning $75,000 to $100,000 and up. These customers don\u2019t have as much money to refinance a mortgage, which can often cost thousands of dollars.\n\nMany millennials already had to rely on the \u201cBank of Mom and Dad\u201d to provide funds to cover a down payment or ongoing payments on a house. These young Americans have more pressing needs \u2014 like paying off student debt. Despite being the largest generation in American history, millennials are not as likely to be homeowners as those in older generations.\n\nRead: Millennials are the new face of the retirement crisis\n\nOf course, not all millennials are alike. The group also makes up 25% of our customers who earn more than $200,000 per year. These higher-earning individuals are aggressively seeking to refinance their mortgages, on par with the boomers who are taking advantage of lower rates. Indeed, these higher paid millennials want to save money when rates are low \u2014 it\u2019s just that many young Americans are not earning enough to have that choice.\n\nIn fact, 78% of our millennial and boomer customers who refinanced opted for cash-outs in 2018, and 58% did so far this year. Among our direct-to-consumer segment (as in, non-branch or in-person service), about half of our customers are using the cash for home improvements, university fees, wedding costs, etc. The other half is choosing to pay off other debt obligations that carry higher interest rates. In other words, refinancing helps our customers bring their overall debt costs down. \u201cThis puts after tax dollars into the pockets of Americans, which helps to drive the economy,\u201d said Chad Smith, an executive vice president at our firm. It\u2019s a virtuous circle.\n\nBoomers and millennials both have something else in common. Our millennial customers who refinance prefer to do so in our retail branches. This may be of course because of the composition of our sales channel, as we have thousands of loan consultants across the U.S.. But since refinancing can be a significant (and sometimes complex) financial event, millennials like to meet with our loan consultants in person to go over the details.\n\nHow mortgage companies can meet millennials\u2019 needs\n\nHow can mortgage companies better serve millennials? Some solutions:\n\n\u2022 Lower fees: By reducing refinancing fees, mortgage providers can make it more attractive for young Americans to take advantage of falling rates.\n\n\u2022 Higher debt-to-income (DTI): By permitting millennials to have higher DTI ratios, buyers will be able to put less money down for a house and so will have more funds available should rates improve.\n\n\u2022 Financial literacy: Loan consultants can make it clearer to their millennial customers that lower rates will be beneficial over the long term. Because millennials prefer face-to-face meetings, our loan consultants are taking the opportunity to explain the virtuous circle of re-financing.\n\nAs the parent of a millennial, I know firsthand that the one thing young Americans may like less than refi fees is FOMO: Fear of Missing Out. More young Americans should be offered ways to take advantage of lower rates so they won\u2019t miss out on improving their longer-term financial security.\n\nSanjiv Das is CEO of Caliber Home Loans , one of the largest housing specialty firms in the U.S. He was CEO of CitiMortgage from 2008 to 2013.\n\nMore: Here\u2019s what millennial home buyers really care about when getting a mortgage", "description": "Younger Americans desperately need debt relief but can\u2019t afford to refinance.", "authors": ["Sanjiv Das"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HE764_neighb_ZG_20190228085810.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
