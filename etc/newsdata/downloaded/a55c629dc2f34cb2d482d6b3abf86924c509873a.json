The North also warned that relatives of offenders will be banished.\n\nThe warning accuses bootleggers of being \"anti-party and anti-North Korean,\" and warned that offenders' money and equipment will be confiscated. It called on supervisory agencies to \"ruthlessly stamp out\" such illegal practices.\n\nOne source said authorities issued the warning because problems associated with bootleg liquor and drugs are taking on epidemic proportions.", "description": "Bootleg Liquor, Fake Drugs Punishable by Death in N.Korea", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/07/04/2019070401142_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-04"}
