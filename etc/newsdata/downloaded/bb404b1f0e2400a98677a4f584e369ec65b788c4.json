Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP/Shutterstock\n\nAmerican ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland is a key figure in the Ukraine scandal. The Republican megadonor helped push diplomats to orient American policy toward Ukraine around President Trump\u2019s goal of extorting the country to investigate his domestic rivals. Sondland was scheduled to be deposed by House lawyers today, but the White House has ordered him not to testify, the New York Times reports.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t the White house want him to testify? Trump clearly doesn\u2019t want anybody to testify, and is seeking to delegitimize the entire impeachment inquiry, in keeping with his absurd claim that Congress literally has no right to impeach him. (That right is in the Constitution.) But Sondland is a particularly dangerous witness for Trump, and his testimony could well prove especially damning.\n\nTexts between diplomats showed they clearly grasped that American policy was a quid pro quo, trading a presidential visit and ultimately military aid in return for the Ukrainian government\u2019s investigations into Joe Biden\u2019s son\u2019s Hunter\u2019s dealings there. Sondland played the role of Trump loyalist, pushing back against the qualms of the professional diplomats who were disgusted by the policy they were being asked to implement,\n\nThe most incriminating text exchange came when Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, recorded his objections to the policy: \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d Sondland waiting five hours to respond. The Wall Street Journal reports today that he\u2019d spoken with Trump in the interim. After getting his talking points from the president, Sondland denied that there was a quid pro quo and very suspiciously asked to move the discussion from texts to over the phone.\n\nTrump has been intermittently transparent about his aims \u2014 he thinks he has an absolute right to demand that any country investigate any American, and that he did nothing wrong with Ukraine. But while he has confessed to demanding the investigations \u2014 and, indeed, demanded even more of them \u2014 he has been cagey about the quid pro quo aspect.\n\nSondland\u2019s testimony could show Trump\u2019s directing a cover-up. The White House has been attacking the whistle-blower complaint as \u201csecondhand\u201d information, implying that a full accounting of the facts would exonerate Trump. Its refusal to allow testimony from a witness key to implementing the administration\u2019s Ukraine policy shows that transparency is the last thing Trump wants. We\u2019ve already seen proof of the crime. Now the White House is undertaking the cover-up.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff tells reporters that Sondland has more evidence stored on a personal device. The State Department is withholding that evidence from the committee.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is emphasizing that Sonland affirmed his no-quid-pro-quo talking point after they spoke, as if this indicates his innocence:\n\n....to see. Importantly, Ambassador Sondland\u2019s tweet, which few report, stated, \u201cI believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions. The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.\u201d That says it ALL! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2019\n\nRight, nothing says \u201cinnocent\u201d like an underlying being so concerned about being conscripted into an unethical scheme he memorializes it in writing, only for his supervisor to check in with the boss offline, repeat the party line, and then instruct everybody to communicate in a way that can\u2019t be used as evidence.\n\nThis post has been updated.", "description": "American ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland was scheduled to be deposed by House lawyers today, but the White House has ordered him not to testify.
