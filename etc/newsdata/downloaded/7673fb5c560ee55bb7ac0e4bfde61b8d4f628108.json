Another strong quarter is expected", "language": "en", "text": "It sounds like a broken record, but Facebook Inc.\u2019s results continue to do just that: break records.\n\nExpect more of the same Wednesday, when the social-networking giant announces third-quarter results.\n\nKeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Andy Hargreaves certainly does. \u201cWe expect Facebook to report solid top-line growth with potential for upside to our and consensus revenue estimates,\u201d he said in an Oct. 21 note that maintained an Overweight rating on Facebook shares with a price target of $240 -- 28% above its closing price on Friday.\n\nThe more Facebook FB, +0.80% is eviscerated by politicians, regulators, privacy advocates, and consumers, the less its stock or bottom line seem to be impacted. Facebook\u2019s stock is up 43% this year, and it is projected to haul in $17.4 billion in third-quarter sales and earnings of $1.90 a share, according to analysts polled by FactSet.\n\nAd sales, which accounted for nearly all of Facebook\u2019s $55.8 billion in 2018 revenue, are projected to reach $70.3 billion this year, an increase of 26%. Monthly active users should reach 2.45 billion in the third quarter, up 8% year-over-year -- no small feat.

Digital advertising, meanwhile, is unlikely to maintain its torrid pace as large and small businesses more closely scrutinize their ad budgets, GroupM analyst Brian Wieser told MarketWatch in a phone interview.\n\nThere is one other stark number that should give Facebook pause.\n\nAmericans are spending 26% less time on Facebook than they did two years ago, and they\u2019re increasingly using more social networks as an alternative.\n\nFacebook users spent on average 12:52 hours a month on the platform in 2017; today, that figure is down to 9:28 hours, according to a study by market researcher Active Inc. At the same time, social media users in the U.S. belong to 5.8 different social media networks; by 2023, it should be 10.", "description": "The more Facebook Inc. is eviscerated by politicians, regulators, privacy advocates, and consumers, the less its stock or bottom line seem to be impacted.", "authors": ["Jon Swartz", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU061_Facebo_ZG_20191025172424.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
