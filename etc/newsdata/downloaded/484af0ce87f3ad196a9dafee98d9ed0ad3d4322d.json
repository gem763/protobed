Can a novel made of words (and not fitted with built-in speakers or Bluetooth) explore the wordless mysteries of music, and music\u2019s impact on people and the world? How?\u201d Mitchell asked. \u201cIs it possible to dance about architecture after all? Utopia Avenue is my rather hefty stab at an answer.\u201d\n\nUtopia Avenue will tell the \u201cunexpurgated story\u201d of a British band of the same name, who emerged from London\u2019s psychedelic scene in 1967 and was \u201cfronted by folk singer Elf Holloway, guitar demigod Jasper de Zoet and blues bassist Dean Moss\u201d, said publisher Sceptre.\n\n\u201cUtopia Avenue released only two LPs during its brief and blazing journey from the clubs of Soho and draughty ballrooms, to Top of the Pops and the cusp of chart success, to glory in Amsterdam, prison in Rome and a fateful American fortnight in the autumn of 1968,\u201d said the publisher, adding that the book would tell of \u201criots in the streets and revolutions in the head; of drugs, thugs, madness, love, sex, death, art; of the families we choose and the ones we don\u2019t; of fame\u2019s Faustian pact and stardom\u2019s wobbly ladder\u201d.\n\nThe publicity asks: \u201cCan we change the world in turbulent times, or does the world change us? Utopia means \u2018nowhere\u2019 but could a shinier world be within grasp, if only we had a map?\u201d\n\nUtopia Avenue follows Slade House (2015) and The Bone Clocks (2014), which was longlisted for the Booker prize. His previous novels include Cloud Atlas \u2013 No 9 in the Guardian\u2019s top 100 books of the 21st century \u2013 and number9dream, which were both shortlisted for the Booker prize.", "description": "Due out next summer, the novel will explore the power of music, following the career of the eponymous psychedelic band", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30c2d64dbf80825e034bad91ed6c6ec2c87b85b5/0_282_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=01509830541030a9601e1cb4f7d6e574", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
