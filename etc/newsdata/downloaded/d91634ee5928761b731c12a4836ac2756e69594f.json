Some experts remain unconvinced.\n\nThe bitcoin market isn\u2019t yet mature enough to support an exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nSo said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last week when it rejected Bitwise\u2019s bitcoin ETF proposal in a mammoth 112-page order that included more than 500 footnotes.\n\nLegal experts said the decision suggests that a bitcoin ETF may still be years away. But Matt Hougan, Bitwise\u2019s global head of research, sees positives in the decision. The SEC has at least shown it\u2019s willing to raise addressable concerns, rather than rejecting a product out-of-hand with little explanation.\n\n\u201cA bad outcome would have been a cursory [filing],\u201d Hougan told CoinDesk, adding:\n\n\u201cAfter digesting it a little bit, we\u2019re pleased with the detail the staff provided and the clarity of what we have to do.\u201d\n\nZachary Fallon, a principal at Blakemore Fallon, said that while Bitwise\u2019s effort may not have been successful, the process was revealing \u2013 and will almost certainly help when launching a bitcoin ETF at some point in the future.\n\nMarket manipulation\n\nThe SEC worries about the bitcoin market because of the potential for manipulation, said Lindsay Danas-Cohen, general counsel and chief operating officer at crypto exchange and brokerage Velocity Markets.\n\nBitwise pointed to its research showing that 95 percent of crypto trading is fake as proof that it understands the market. Perhaps understandably, this didn\u2019t help the company\u2019s case.\n\n\u201cBitwise tried to get out in front of these arguments by asserting they\u2019re very aware that only 5 percent of the bitcoin spot markets are \u2018real\u2019 and I commend that effort,\u201d Danas-Cohen told CoinDesk.\n\nBut Fallon, a former SEC senior counsel, said Bitwise did not explain how the exchanges with \u201creal\u201d volume were insulated from the prices found on other platforms.\n\nHe added:\n\n\u201cBitwise did not address the concern that the price quoted on legitimate digital asset trading platforms is itself influenced by the weight of the other 95 percent and the prices quoted there. So it\u2019s like the tail wagging the dog, or the dog wagging the tail, and the SEC said, \u2018You need to address that risk.\u2019\u201d\n\nSurveillance sharing\n\nThe solution to this issue, according to the SEC, may be surveillance-sharing agreements between national exchanges sponsoring ETFs (such as NYSE Arca, which filed the actual ETF proposal for Bitwise) and regulated markets.\n\n\u201cUntil an ETF sponsor can satisfy the SEC\u2019s demand for surveillance-sharing agreements \u2013 or until the SEC changes its view on the Exchange Act (which almost certainly means waiting for a new Chairman) \u2013 there will be no bitcoin ETF,\u201d Jake Chervinsky, general counsel at Compound Finance, told CoinDesk in a Twitter DM.\n\nChervinsky does not see this happening anytime soon:\n\n\u201cThe SEC once again strongly rejected the idea that a bitcoin ETF sponsor can satisfy Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5) without entering surveillance-sharing agreements with regulated markets of significant size, and given bitcoin\u2019s current market structure, it\u2019s very unlikely that any sponsor will be able to enter such agreements within the next couple years.\u201d\n\n(The SEC previously defined a \u201csignificant market\u201d as one that where an individual trying to manipulate an exchange-traded product would have to trade on the same market, meaning a surveillance-sharing agreement would help in identifying any would-be manipulators.)\n\nNotably, Danas-Cohen said the fresh emphasis on a surveillance-sharing agreement differs from previous disapprovals.\n\nShe speculated that, should the SEC greenlight an ETF in the future, it would want to point to such an agreement as evidence that it did everything in its power to protect against market manipulation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just something tangible that the SEC can point to and review explicitly and say, \u2018Hey, broader world, this is exactly what we\u2019re relying on and this is why we think that fraud and manipulation are rightfully off the table as significant concerns in the space,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nPhilip Liu, chief legal officer and co-founder of investment firm Arca, noted that the SEC\u2019s new order scarcely raised concerns about digital asset custody \u2013 a break from previous rejections that have focused on this issue.\n\n\u201cI assume that the custody issues are pretty much moot at this point,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are a number of reputable \u201ccustodians\u201d in the space now, including Coinbase Custody and Paxos Trust Company, and increased transparency between these entities and the regulators could help the SEC become more comfortable with the issue, Danas-Cohen said.\n\nMoonshot\n\nIt seems unlikely that the SEC will approve an ETF for launch in the near future. Arca\u2019s Liu told CoinDesk that the SEC took a thorough look at the question and \u201cpretty much put the kibosh\u201d on the concept.\n\nFor his part, Chervinsky does not expect an ETF before the latter half of 2020.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to assume that Jay Clayton\u2019s SEC will never approve a bitcoin ETF,\u201d he added on Twitter.\n\nClayton\u2019s term is set to end in June 2021, but under SEC rules he could remain in office until 2023 if not replaced. The SEC chairman has long been an outspoken skeptic of the bitcoin market, saying as recently as last month that sponsors and companies applying for an ETF have work to do addressing issues such as market manipulation.\n\nDanas-Cohen said she would be surprised if an ETF was approved over the next year:\n\n\u201cUnder the current regime, I think it\u2019s going to be difficult for an applicant to get all its ducks in a row in a manner that would give the SEC comfort. I think it would take a bit longer for the SEC to wrap their arms around the space.\u201d\n\nChervinsky says the SEC\u2019s current perspective on the Exchange Act comes directly from Chairman Clayton.\n\n\u201cIt was the crux of the Commissioners\u2019 denial of the Winklevoss ETF appeal in July 2017,\u201d he said.\n\nThe SEC did not write the latest rejection. Instead, it delegated the task to the Division of Trading and Markets, Fallon noted. He said this could be because the commissioners do not have much to add on top of what they wrote in the Winklevoss rejection.\n\nNext steps\n\nThe rejection won\u2019t stop Bitwise. Hougan said the SEC has provided enough detail for his company to file again at a future date, though Bitwise has not yet decided when it will re-file.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anything [the SEC] said [that was] fundamental to the bitcoin market was impossible to meet,\u201d he said, adding:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of answering their questions and providing them with yet more extensive data.\u201d\n\nBitwise intends to explore surveillance-sharing agreements and it isn\u2019t alone. VanEck and SolidX, which withdrew their ETF proposal with Cboe BZX in September, are also likely to re-file their rule change proposal at some future date.\n\nAsked if he expects an ETF to one day be approved, Hougan said:\n\n\u201cI think if we can satisfy their requests, yeah, absolutely. I don\u2019t think the commissioners or the Commission is inherently anti-bitcoin or crypto, I just think they\u2019re appropriately cautious.\u201d\n\nOthers remain less certain.\n\nBitwise did \u201cmove the baton further down the line,\u201d but that\u2019s no guarantee the company will get an ETF approved, Fallon said.\n\nHe likened the approval process for the ETF to convincing his parents to let him drive a car. There was an initial struggle, but, after a certain point, his parents gave in.\n\nAssuming Bitwise \u2013 or another company \u2013 can answer the market manipulation issues, there is no reason why an ETF won\u2019t be approved eventually, he said.\n\nDanas-Cohen said identifying what a \u201csignificant market\u201d consists of is another step that Bitwise needs to take if it wants to establish a surveillance-sharing agreement.\n\nBut for other observers, doubts remain.\n\nSaid Arca\u2019s Liu:\n\n\u201cThe takeaway is, I just don\u2019t see how it can be approved at this stage \u2013 for anybody that comes in.\u201d\n\nSEC Chairman Jay Clayton image via CoinDesk archives", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/jay-clayton-coindesk.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
