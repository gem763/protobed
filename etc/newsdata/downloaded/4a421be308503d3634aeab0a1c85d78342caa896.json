Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan said the odds of a recession in the next 12 months are relatively low, another reason for investors to shift more money into equities.\n\nMeanwhile, political worries eased as investors largely shrugging off the Democrats' decision to begin an impeachment inquiry into Trump. That came even as a summary of a telephone call showed the U.S. president asked Ukraine's president to investigate a political rival. doubts over the likelihood of an impeachment is the majority held by Trump's Republicans in the Senate, which can be used to quash any attempt to remove the president from office.\n\nU.S. crude ticked up 0.07% to $56.53 a barrel in a sign some investors anticipate higher demand for energy and fuel in the future due to stronger economic activity.\n\nTreasury yields gave up some of their gains in Asia after rising in overnight trade.\n\nThe yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell slightly to 1.7025%.
