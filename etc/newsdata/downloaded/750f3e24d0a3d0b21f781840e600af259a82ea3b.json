Binotto said they had not expected the four times world champion to gain as much time (3.9 seconds) on his fresher tyres as he had.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, when we stopped Sebastian, we thought that Charles stopping the lap after, he would have remained ahead of Sebastian,\u201d said the Italian.\n\nAsked if Ferrari had considered swapping their drivers around given the unintended consequence of the pit strategy, Binotto said they had but ultimately decided against it.\n\n\u201cWe are still discussing with our two drivers whether that was the right choice or not, something which internally we may still have a different opinion (on),\u201d he said.\n\nLeclerc said he had understood the situation a lot better than in the heat of the moment behind the wheel.\n\n\u201cObviously I wished I was one step higher today but it\u2019s part of life,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes it goes that way and I\u2019ll bounce back stronger in (the next race) Russia.\u201d", "description": "Ferrari defended their Singapore Grand Prix pitstop strategy on Sunday after it set up Sebastian Vettel to beat team mate Charles Leclerc, who had led from pole position, in a one-two finish.", "authors": ["Abhishek Takle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432835897&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M09V", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
