Mic in hand, Larkin asked Biden how the American people could expect him to find solutions for man-induced climate change when Biden\u2019s itinerary has him attending a fundraiser sponsored in part by Andrew Goldman, a co-founder of natural gas company Western LNG. (Goldman was an adviser for Biden when he was in the Senate.) Co-host Anderson Cooper, to his credit, pressed Biden when he dodged the question; Biden who responded to many of the questions in a fashion suggesting annoyance that he had to participate in the event at all, responded, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize he does that.\u201d\n\nI feel like Biden always just sounds like he's offended he's even being asked the question. \u2014 Emily Atkin (@emorwee) September 5, 2019\n\nBiden\u2019s portion, on the whole, was a 40-minute long slip on a banana peel, featuring rhetorical inquiries such as, \u201cWhat\u2019s Darfur all about?\u201d along with a determined (and a little unnerving) power walk toward CNN chief climate correspondent Bill Weir. Biden refused to commit to a ban on fracking, offering a state\u2019s rights defense and reminding the audience that, \u201ceverything is incremental\u201d\u2014a blanket statement if ever there was one. Cooper noted at the end of the segment that Goldman \u201cdoesn\u2019t currently have day-to-day responsibilities\u201d at Western LNG, providing Biden the thinnest of life vests about a half-hour too late.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s not to heap too much praise on the network hosts, though. There were a series of repeat questions from the CNN moderators to keep the show consistent, though most of them were shallow inquiries compared to what a vigorous debate would require. This included one about whether Americans would \u201chave\u201d to drive electric cars, a question focused on individual consumption in a way unlikely to advance the cause of broader (and much more important) policy shifts. Another focused on Trump\u2019s recent decision to revert lightbulb restrictions, to which Warren had the best answer, taking a step back from moderator Chris Cuomo\u2019s original question and examining how fossil fuel corporations want citizens concerned with individual actions and not the massive industrial contributions to carbon emissions. (Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s exasperated \u201cDuhhh,\u201d when asked whether he would reinstate the restrictions, scores as a very-close second.)\n\nRefreshingly, directly after the dreaded lightbulb question, Warren faced a proposal from Robert Wood, a writer and organizer with the Brooklyn chapter of climate activist group 350, that pressed her to criticize capitalism\u2019s role in climate change, asking about the prospect of nationalizing, or at least public oversight of, utility companies.\n\n\u201cGosh, I don\u2019t know if that gets you to the solution,\u201d Warren said. \u201cIf somebody wants to make a profit from building better solar panels and generating better battery storage, I\u2019m not opposed to that. What I\u2019m opposed to is when they do that in a way that hurts everybody else.\u201d\n\nGiven that a seven-hour show is a seven-hour show, there was a lot of ground covered, a great deal of which won\u2019t make the ensuing reviews and round-ups. Among the likely soon-to-be forgotten moments, Yang touched on the issue of getting other countries to do their part (let it blared from the rooftops that America has, by far, emitted the most carbon of any developed country in the past two-and-a-half centuries); Cooper snuck in a \u201cbig feet\u201d joke about an audience member; and Senator Cory Booker referenced both a TedTalk and Star Trek.\n\nThat inherent issue of length with this format\u2014a way to skirt DNC restrictions\u2014is precisely why a real debate on climate change is still needed. Wednesday night\u2019s discussion was useful in that it forced all of the candidates to answer basic questions and held their feet to the fire on fossil fuel and fracking issues. But the lack of a timer allowed for all ten of the politicians to do what they do best, which is hit their talking points, then highlight and underline them until they\u2019re cut off. A debate, in theory, excises the repetition of baseline proposals and forces the candidates to deliver performances more approachable than Wednesday\u2019s offering of stump speeches for climate wonks. More importantly, it allows for voters who may not be as engaged on the subject to line up their options and not have to keep a scorecard and ten separate campaign websites running for seven hours. (If you are looking for an intuitive score card for the candidates\u2019s various climate proposals, try this one, from Data For Progress.)\n\nI can\u2019t quite decide how I feel about the whole thing yet. The upbeat side of me believes that the fact that a major cable network was willing to cordon off a seven-hour block just to face the issue of climate change will ultimately prove to be a net positive, one that leads to the DNC overturning its ruling and to a climate change discussion in coming debates that exceeds twenty minutes. The cynical side says that, even after all the back-patting the candidates and CNN provided themselves, the ratings will come in low, because average working Americans don\u2019t have seven hours to dedicate to anything, let alone a Ken Burns-length C-SPAN sort of offering with slightly better lighting and graphics.
