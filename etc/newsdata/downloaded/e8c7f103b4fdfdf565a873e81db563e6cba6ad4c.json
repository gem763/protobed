Indians had the highest awareness of BRI, with 50 percent of respondents knowing about it, followed by Japan (43 percent), Italy (40 percent), and Russia (30 percent), the poll said.\n\nYu said that one in every five foreigners knowing about the BRI meant that the initiative had already won much higher attention than many other global initiatives.\n\n\"The BRI is an operation platform for global cooperation,\" he said. \"And whether it is in countries that are involved in it yet or not, people have more awareness about it.\"\n\nHe also added that connectivity of infrastructure and trade, which could directly be connected to ordinary people's interests and bring tangible benefits to them, are the issues of most concern for respondents.\n\n\"China has helped many countries involved in the BRI build railways, roads, and bridges, which could improve transportation, offer job opportunities and gives impetus to local economic development,\" he said.\n\nMoreover, trade connectivity could drive the flow of goods and people among the countries involved in the initiative, directly boosting economic development and improving people's livelihoods, Yu added.\n\nFigures from China's Ministry of Commerce showed that from January to September this year, Chinese companies had increased investment in 56 countries along the Belt and Road, totaling $10.04 billion.\n\nTom Simpson, China managing director of the China-Britain Business Council, or CBBC, said that in the United Kingdom, people's awareness of the BRI is increasing, though work still needs to be done to increase their level of understanding about this initiative.\n\n\"The UK Treasury has appointed a BRI special envoy, which demonstrates the level of interest in the BRI that the British government has,\" he said, adding that the CBBC had also produced a series of reports on the BRI to help UK companies to better understand the opportunities to participate.\n\n\"We are seeing a growing number of UK accounting firms, law firms, banks and insurers who are working with Chinese companies on BRI projects across the world,\" he said.\n\nAnd he added that the British people and companies are most interested in learning about what kind of business opportunities there are and what kind of projects they could get involved in, so that they could use their expertise and services in these projects.\n\n\"The BRI is a whole new front for the UK and Chinese companies to work together in global markets,\" he said. \" It enlarges the range of ways that UK and Chinese companies can collaborate.\"\n\nHisham AbuBakr Metwally, an economics researcher with the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Trade and Industry, said that in Egypt, China's investment has made more locals familiar with the BRI.\n\nFor example, the Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone in Egypt, which has been connected to the BRI, and has attracted dozens of Chinese companies, has \"great influence in raising the awareness of Egyptians about BRI\", he said.\n\nHe said that there are two important aspects about the BRI that Egyptians are interested in knowing about.\n\n\"The first is whether they will have mega infrastructure projects like those financed and implemented by China in many countries, as these mega projects have had a good impact on boosting economies and contributing to growth,\" he said.\n\nThe second issue is the promotion of trade between China and Egypt and how Egyptians can benefit from China's trade and financial muscle, he said.", "description": "There is an increasing global recognition of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, especially of its contribution to the regional and global economy, analysts said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/28/5db63dd1a310cf3e97a3258c.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
