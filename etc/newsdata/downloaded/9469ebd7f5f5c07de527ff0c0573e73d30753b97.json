The revolution that led to his downfall inspired uprisings in neighbouring countries that came to be viewed as the Arab Spring. But while Tunisia managed a steady transition to democracy, with free elections held last Sunday, economically many people are no better off.\n\nBen Ali became president in November 1987 after Habib Bourguiba, the founder of modern Tunisia and president-for-life, was deemed to be too senile to rule. Bourguiba had appointed Ben Ali prime minister the previous month, and a popular, bloodless palace coup \u2013 \u201cThe Change\u201d \u2013 followed.\n\nThe new leader of north Africa\u2019s smallest country, situated between Algeria and Libya, and with a population of now more than 11 million people, was strongly pro-western. He developed ties with the European Union, Tunisia\u2019s main trading partner. Foreign investment, manufacturing and tourism all increased, but unemployment remained high. Despite Ben Ali\u2019s relatively liberal social and economic outlook, progress towards effective multiparty democracy was slow, and human rights abuses were reported, particularly towards Islamic activists.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ben Ali with the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 1999.

In 1986, Libya had expelled 30,000 Tunisian workers, and the following year Ben Ali, as interior minister, was believed to have been behind the veto that prevented Libya from joining Tunisia\u2019s friendship treaty with Algeria and Mauritania. However, turning a blind eye to sanctions-busting led to an improvement in Tunisia\u2019s relations with its south-eastern neighbour. Business double standards ran right through Ben Ali\u2019s approach to government, and ultimately led to his downfall.\n\nHe was born into a modest family in Hammam Sousse, a coastal town in the north-east, when Tunisia was still a French protectorate. At the Sousse secondary school, he joined the anti-French resistance, working for the regional Neo Destour party. This earned him expulsion and a short prison term.\n\nHe then moved to France, where he graduated from the military academy at St Cyr, near Paris, then the artillery school at Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne, before continuing his military education in the US. On his return to Tunisia, he joined military intelligence. He served as Tunisia\u2019s military attache in Morocco for three years from 1974, and was then appointed a full general, the highest rank in Tunisia\u2019s 25,000-strong army.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ben Ali, right, with Nicolas Sarkozy at the EU-Mediterranean summit in Paris in 2008.

That year he was credited with crushing the riots over price increases backed by the general union of Tunisian workers. Scores of people were killed. In 1986 he became interior minister.\n\nAs president, Ben Ali promised a gradual move towards democracy, and began to usher in a new era of human rights and democratic principles. Tunisians welcomed the change, and the legal reforms of 1987-89 included the release of political prisoners and an end to restrictions on political parties.\n\nThe economy was growing at about 5% a year, and health and education reforms were introduced. Ben Ali boosted women\u2019s rights, a process continued later by his second wife, Le\u00efla Trabelsi, a former hairdresser, whom he married in 1992.\n\nHowever, the president, fluent in French, Arabic and English, betrayed his feelings when he told a French newspaper: \u201cOnly order permits the full development of democratic institutions.\u201d By the 1990s, wary of the opposition, in particular Rachid Ghannouchi\u2019s Islamist Ennahda (Awakening) party, which was banned in 1989, he began to suspend political rights, muzzling the media and cracking down on human rights activists. Opponents found themselves in prison.\n\nIn the first multicandidate presidential elections, in 1999, Ben Ali won an official majority of 99.44% of the votes. In May 2002 he held a referendum to change the constitution so that he could serve a fourth term. He was re-elected in October 2004, officially taking 94.48% of the vote and his party, the Democratic Constitutional Rally, won 152 seats in the 189-seat parliament.\n\nIn November 2009 he was elected to a fifth five-year term, with a vote that dropped just below 90%. He criticised claims that the elections were fraudulent as coming from people \u201cwho have forgotten their moral duty of good behaviour and reserve against those who try to harm the motherland ... We shall take the measures provided by the law against such behaviour.\u201d\n\nThe unrest gathered momentum in December 2010, after police confiscated the cart from which Muhammad Bouazizi sold fruit and vegetables without a permit, and the despairing graduate set himself on fire and died. This took place within the context of rising prices and a severe economic downturn, and in the subsequent demonstrations around 300 people were killed.\n\nA June 2008 cable from the US embassy in Tunis, published by WikiLeaks, quoted from a report by the anti-corruption group Transparency International: \u201cWhether it is cash, services, land, property ... President Ben Ali\u2019s family is rumoured to covet it and reportedly gets what he wants.\u201d The cables called Ben Ali\u2019s extended family a \u201cquasi-mafia\u201d and said it is considered \u201cthe nexus of Tunisian corruption\u201d. They added that \u201cseemingly half of the Tunisian business community\u201d can claim connection with Ben Ali through marriage.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters demonstrating in Tunis against Ben Ali in 2011.

On 28 December 2010 he called the protesters \u201cextremists and mercenaries\u201d and warned of \u201cfirm\u201d punishment, but then tried to appease them by reshuffling his cabinet and promising to create 300,000 extra jobs. Only days before leaving Tunisia, he said that he would not change the constitution, which implied that he planned to remain president until 2014. Then, on 26 January, he fled, first to Malta under Libyan protection and then to Jeddah.\n\nThere was a certain irony for a man who had fought against the hijab in Tunisia being given asylum in the world\u2019s most conservative Islamic state. France forbade him from landing on French soil. An Air Tunis pilot who refused to take off from Tunis with five other members of Ben Ali\u2019s family became a national hero. Ben Ali was replaced by Fouad Mebezaa as acting president, and he called Beji Caid Essebsi out of retirement to act as prime minister until elections at the end of the year.\n\nThe Swiss government pledged to freeze assets belonging to Ben Ali and his family. Forbes magazine had estimated Ben Ali\u2019s fortune at about $5bn in 2008. After he fled, he was convicted in absentia on various counts of theft and incitement to violence and murder.\n\nIn 2014 Essebsi became Tunisia\u2019s first freely elected president. He died in July this year and Mohamed Ennaceur took over as interim president. In the recent election, a supporter of Ben Ali won 4% of the vote.\n\nBen Ali remained in Saudi Arabia, where he was being treated for prostate cancer. He is survived by his wife, their two daughters and son, and by three daughters from his first marriage.\n\n\u2022 Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, politician, born 3 September 1936; died 19 September 2019", "description": "Former president of Tunisia who fled to Saudi Arabia after the 2011 uprising", "authors": ["Trevor Mostyn"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a864a6b24e06e0fd74a6d21d0fb4f7bcca28c2bb/0_788_2024_1213/master/2024.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6278d2c8d5ff2abfea3cb7bf8c63f398", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
