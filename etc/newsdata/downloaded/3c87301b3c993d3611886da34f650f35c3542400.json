Prince William and Kate Middleton's royal wedding - memorable moments 1/8 First look at the wedding dress As the Duchess of Cambridge stepped out of her car at the entrance of Westminster Abbey, the public were given their first full look at the bride's beautiful wedding dress. The duchess wore a gown created by London-based designer Sarah Burton at Alexander McQueen. The dress was made of satin and featured an overlaid lace bodice and appliqued skirt. The bride's sister, maid of honour Pippa Middleton, also wore a dress by Burton, and made headlines on the day as she carried her sister's wedding dress train. 'It's a bit startling to achieve global recognition before the age of 30, on account of your sister, brother-in-law and your bottom,\" Middleton wrote in her 2012 book Celebrate, in reference to the attention her figure received in the media. Getty Images 2/8 Eccentric wedding guest attire In addition to the bride's wedding gown, one of the most memorable sartorial moments from the 2011 royal wedding was Princess Beatrice's choice of headwear. The royal's pale pink headpiece by London-based milliner Philip Treacy received a strong reaction in the media, with some comparing it to a 'pretzel'. Soon after the wedding, Princess Beatrice auctioned the fascinator off for charity. The headpiece was sold on eBay for more than \u00a381,000, the proceeds of which was donated to charities Unicef and Children in Crisis. Treacy said he feared his head would be 'on a spike outside the Tower of London' following the intense reaction to the headpiece. 'But it was a very modern hat and modernity is always unusual thing,' he added. Getty Images 3/8 A sentimental brotherly exchange As the Duchess of Cambridge walked down the aisle in Westminster Abbey, eagle-eyed viewers watching the royal wedding on television spotted Prince Harry glance at his sister-in-law-to-be, before whispering something to the groom, Prince William. While it's unknown what Prince Harry said to his brother, some believe he may have made a joke to help with the groom's nerves.

It's widely believed that he said: 'You look beautiful.' Getty Images 5/8 A brief moment of panic For the estimated 26 million people in the UK who watched the royal wedding live on television on 29 April 2011, collective panic momentarily spread across the nation when Prince William appeared to struggle putting the wedding ring on the finger of his bride. Luckily, after a few seconds, the duke managed to slide the ring down his newlywed's finger much to the relief of onlookers. AFP/Getty Images 6/8 Sealing their union with a kiss The moment the public had been waiting for. Following their nuptials in Westminster Abbey, the royal couple travelled to Buckingham Palace, where they stepped out onto the palace's famous balcony. The duke and duchess then shared their first couple of kisses as a married couple, prompting cheers from the thousands of people below. The moment was reminiscent of the kiss shared between Prince Williams father and mother, Prince Charles and the late Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1981. Getty Images 7/8 The disgruntled flower girl While the crowds expressed their delight in the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge kissing on the Buckingham Palace balcony, one individual in particular was not enjoying the occasion. One of the flower girls on the balcony made headlines when she was pictured covering her ears, a disgruntled expression on her face. The child in question was Grace Van Cutsem, Prince William's goddaughter. Getty Images 8/8 Newlyweds on the road Following all the pomp of the royal wedding, the duke and duchess drove away from Buckingham Palace in a vintage car, with Prince William at the wheel. The car was adorned with a number plate which read \"JU5T WED\", and had several balloons attached at the back.
