However, his erratic behaviour would ultimately come back to bite him as \u2014 unable to take Lee\u2019s smug and arrogant demeanor any longer \u2014 he picked up a shovel and hit the rapist on the back of the head.\n\nVictoria agreed to lie to the police to save her brother as she was under the pretence that Robert had simply acted in self-defence. However, upon learning that his attack on Lee was rage-driven and deliberate, Vic was understandably upset. Nonetheless, she agreed to stick by him, but Robert ended up pleading guilty to save his sister having to lie in court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, he\u2019s enjoyed spending what free time he\u2019s got left with husband Aaron (Danny Miller), but the coming episodes will see the young man dealt another devastating blow. After learning the earth-shattering news that her rapist has died, Victoria arrives at Robert and Aaron\u2019s cottage to inform her brother.\n\nLee\u2019s death will undoubtedly mean that Robert will be charged with murder \u2014 which means that, despite his guilty plea, he\u2019s looking at having to serve a much longer sentence in prison.\n\nRyan Hawley said: \u2018It\u2019s shocking, it comes out of nowhere. Victoria comes and says Lee has died and they very quickly start to process what the implications will mean for Robert\u2019s sentencing. He\u2019s pled guilty already to GBH with intent, section 18, which will inevitably mean he will now be guilty or he thinks he will be found guilty fo the murder of Lee Posner.\u2019\n\nHow will Robert react to this news?\n\nWhat\u2019s more, what will it mean for his future with Aaron?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Robert's world comes crashing down \u2014 but what does this mean for his future?", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/robertsugdenemmerdale-b324_1570486620.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
