He was later charged in Westmoreland County, which is located east of Pittsburgh, with felony counts of statutory sexual assault, unlawful contact with a minor and corruption of minors and a misdemeanor count of indecent assault of a person under 16 years old.\n\n\u201cIt was a definitely a weird situation throughout the day,\u201d losing pitcher Mitch Keller said. \u201cBut once the game comes then everyone is focused on the game, what\u2019s going on there and trying to compete.\u201d\n\nGonzales (16-11) struck out four, walked none and doubled and scored in the fifth inning. The left-hander has set career high in wins, starts (32) and innings pitched (189).\n\nGonzales has two starts remaining and is hopeful of reaching 200 innings.\n\n\u201cThe one main goal was to make all my starts this year and to be a reliable guy for this team and just help us win ballgames,\u201d Gonzales said. \u201cWe have a couple more to go. But I\u2019m happy I stuck to that process. It\u2019s been very relieving to have to commit to that and hopefully sustain that throughout my career.\u201d\n\nSam Tuivailala and Reggie McClain each pitched one inning to complete the eight-hitter.\n\nNarvaez and Nola each had three hits, and their consecutive home runs in the sixth inning off Michael Feliz extended the Mariners\u2018 lead to 4-0. Shed Long led off the seventh with a homer off Williams Jerez as Seattle won its third straight game.\n\nNola, a 29-year-old rookie, has seven hits in his last two games following a 1-for-18 skid.\n\n\u201cYou know how baseball goes,\u201d Nola said. \u201cIt\u2019s back-and-forth. You try to stay even and get some walks and work an at-bat and have a competitive at-bat. I think that\u2019s what it comes down to.\u201d\n\nKeller (1-5) gave up two runs in five innings and the rookie fell to 0-4 in his last six starts. The Pirates\u2018 Jose Osuna and Erik Gonzalez each had two hits.\n\nDee Gordon opened the scoring with a second-inning sacrifice fly and Gonzales scored on J.P. Crawford\u2019s single to make it 2-0. Narvaez drove in the last run with a single in the seventh.\n\nWorkers removed a banner depicting V\u00e1zquez from outside PNC Park prior to the Pirates losing their fourth game in a row. Team president Frank Coonelly, general manager Neal Huntington and manager Clint Hurdle addressed the players in a pregame meeting and there was a somber mood in the clubhouse afterward.\n\nBy the time the game ended, V\u00e1zquez\u2019s locker had not only been cleaned out but given to infielder Corban Joseph, who joined the team after being claimed off waivers from San Francisco on Monday.\n\nV\u00e1zquez\u2019s arrest came eight days after he and fellow reliever Kyle Crick got into a clubhouse fistfight at San Francisco and were fined. Crick needed season-ending surgery to repair a torn extension tendon in his right index finger.\n\nIn July, reliever Keone Kela and bullpen coach Euclides Rojas were each suspended two games by the Pirates for their involvement in separate incidents.\n\n\u201cWe talked about a lot of different emotions,\u201d Hurdle said of the pregame meeting. \u201cHow do we connect and see our way through those emotions? How do we continue to find ways to improve and hold ourselves to a high standard, on and off the field, and what can we do from an organizational standpoint to help?\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nMariners: OF/DH Domingo Santana (strained right elbow) was activated from the injured list and grounded into a double play as a pinch hitter in the eighth inning.\n\nPirates: 1B Josh Bell (strained left groin), CF Starling Marte (sprained right wrist) and C Jacob Stallings (back spasms) could miss the rest of the season, Hurdle said. \u2026 RHP Chris Stratton (right side inflammation) was reinstated from the IL.\n\nPIRATES\u2018 MOVES\n\nThe Pirates called up INF Jake Elmore from Triple-A Indianapolis to add depth to their injury-depleted roster. A spot on the 40-man roster opened for Elmore when V\u00e1zquez was placed on the restricted list.\n\nKela is expected to replace V\u00e1zquez as closer.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMariners RHP Justin Dunn (0-0, 27.00 ERA) will face RHP Dario Agrazal (4-4, 4.91) on Wednesday night in a matchup of rookies. Dunn made his major league debut Sept. 12 against Cincinnati and allowed two hits and five walks in two-thirds of an inning. Agrazal gave up three runs in four innings in his last start, a no-decision Sept. 11 at San Francisco.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Pittsburgh Pirates' season has been going downhill since the All-Star break and it got even worse Tuesday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Perrotto"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/17/mariners_pirates_baseball_82929_c0-160-3810-2381_s1770x1032.jpg?8fbee9011445d66b0f53fb4b038089367b7231b5", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
