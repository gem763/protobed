He told The Associated Press he had not been able to reach him since last week, when he told his father he would join a group in Paris that was trying to reach England.\n\n\"He often called home but I haven\"t been able to reach him since the last time we talked last week,\" Nguyen Dinh Gia said. \"I told him that he could go to anywhere he wants as long as it's safe. He shouldn't be worry about money, I'll take care of it.\"\n\nHe said his son left home in central Ha Tinh province to work in Russia in 2017, then on to Ukraine.
