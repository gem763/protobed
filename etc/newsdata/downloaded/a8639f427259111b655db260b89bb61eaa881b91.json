Happily, this five-years-later follow-up, \"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,\" flies a bit higher, building on the central relationship while adding Michelle Pfeiffer's regal presence as a killer queen.\n\nThe first \"Maleficent\" actually felt somewhat out of step with Disney's live-action movie strategy, offering a revisionist take -- unlike mostly dutiful remakes like \"The Lion King\" or \"Aladdin\" -- that transformed the dark fairy into the good gal, one who grew to love Aurora, a.k.a. Sleeping Beauty.\n\nDespite that ambition, it was a pretty lifeless affair, beyond the kick of seeing Angelina Jolie vamp it up in the title role, and the appealing notion (which also found a home in \"Frozen\") that \"true love\" -- the kind that can break a spell -- isn't merely the province of winsome maidens and handsome princes.\n\nOpening six decades after the animated \"Sleeping Beauty,\" \"Mistress of Evil\" picks up several years later, and begins with a very decent proposal -- namely, Prince Philip (Harris Dickinson) asking Aurora (Elle Fanning) to live happily ever after with him. When he suggests they tell their parents, however, Aurora swallows hard at the thought.\n\nMaleficent loves \"Beastie,\" as she still calls her, but isn't so thrilled about her marrying a, well, human. Philip's mom, Queen Ingrith (Pfeiffer), is equally unenthused, producing one of those uncomfortable meet-the-in-laws dinners, bringing some welcome humor into the movie.\n\nRead More", "description": "'Maleficent: Mistress of Evil' flies higher, as Angelina Jolie squares off with Michelle Pfeiffer in the Disney sequel", "authors": ["Brian Lowry"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191014173614-maleficent-mistress-of-evil-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
