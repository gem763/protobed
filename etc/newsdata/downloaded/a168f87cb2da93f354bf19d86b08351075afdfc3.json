In May 2017, her lectures were shut down after the speakers\u2019 bureau received a complaint about her \u201clack of balance,\u201d which \u201cI believe poisoned support I might have expected from colleagues in the department,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe speakers\u2019 bureau incident made it clear the administration had no intention of protecting my academic freedom against complaints from outside the university,\u201d said Ms. Crockford in an email to The Washington Times.\n\nUVic associate vice president Michele Parkin responded with a letter challenging the assertion that Ms. Crockford was let go for \u201ctelling school kids politically incorrect facts about polar bears,\u201d referring to a recent headline in the National Post of Toronto.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence to suggest that Dr. Crockford\u2019s adjunct appointment was not renewed for \u2018telling school kids politically incorrect facts about polar bears,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Parkin. \u201cThe University of Victoria, in both word and deed, supports academic freedom and free debate on academic issues.\u201d\n\nThe statement fell short of denying that Ms. Crockford\u2019s dismissal was linked to her polar-bear scholarship, which almost singlehandedly blew up the climate movement\u2019s promotion of the bears as iconic victims of anthropogenic global warming [AGW].\n\nHer books include \u201cThe Polar Bear Catastrophe That Never Happened,\u201d published in February, in which she said the bears are not \u201cthreatened,\u201d noting that the 2015 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species puts their numbers at between 22,000-31,000, despite a widespread belief that the population has dropped to a few thousand.\n\n\u2018Cancel culture\u2019 and academic freedom\n\nMarc Morano, author of \u201cThe Politically Incorrect Guide to Climate Change,\u201d said that situations like Ms. Crockford\u2019s have become \u201call too common in the climate debate,\u201d citing examples of prominent scientists who only \u201ccame out\u201d as skeptics after retiring.\n\n\u201cProfessor after professor has been hounded, silenced, censured or fired for speaking out against the approved man-made climate crisis narrative,\u201d Mr. Morano said. \u201cThe message to any climate dissenters in academia is once again reinforced: Stay silent with your skepticism or risk endangering your career.\u201d\n\nUniversity of Victoria economics professor Cornelis van Kooten warned of the threat to free speech on campus, saying, \u201cI think the climate change movement has done extreme harm to academic freedom,\u201d and that the movement isn\u2019t alone.\n\n\u201cPut it this way: religion, race, evolution, gender, indigenous peoples, nuclear power, polar bears, deforestation \u2026 Any views on these topics that don\u2019t fall in line with the \u2018consensus\u2019 are taboo,\u201d Mr. van Kooten said in an email. \u201cThink the extent to which free speech has been banned from campuses across much of the West in the name of political correctness.\u201d\n\nIn her letter, UVic\u2019s Ms. Parkin noted that adjunct professors are unpaid, meaning that, \u201cDr. Susan Crockford\u2019s work can carry on without this appointment,\u201d but Ms. Crockford said losing the university position will harm her ability to secure grant funding.\n\n\u201cNo one suggested funds were involved,\u201d she said. \u201cThe point is that I will not be able to apply for research grants and in most cases will be unable to collaborate with colleagues on their research projects without a university affiliation.\u201d\n\nCertainly Ms. Crockford has drawn the ire of environmental activists and scientists with whose views she disagrees, based in part on her associations with climate-skeptical organizations like the Heartland Institute and the Global Warming Policy Foundation.\n\nHer Polar Bear Science blog came under fire in a 2017 study in BioScience by 14 academics, including Penn State climatologist Michael E. Mann, decrying the influence of \u201cdenier blogs,\u201d which Georgia Tech professor emeritus Judith Curry blasted as \u201cabsolutely the stupidest paper I have ever seen published.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
