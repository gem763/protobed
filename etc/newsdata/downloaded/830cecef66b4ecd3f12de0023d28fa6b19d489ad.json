You know what's wrong with Chicago? Weak, ineffective politicians. Democrats.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Lightfoot\u2019s predecessor, former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, blamed Trump for the controversy surrounding actor Jussie Smollett, who was accused of falsely claiming to be the victim of a violent attack.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear about something,\u201d Emanuel said at the time. \u201cThe only reason Jussie Smollett thought he could take advantage of a hoax about a hate crime is because of the environment, the toxic environment that Donald Trump created.\n\n\u201cThis is a president who drew a moral equivalency between people who are trying to perpetuate bigotry and those who are trying to fight bigotry.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, Trump had criticized Emanuel as being an ineffective leader.\n\n\u201cBetter tell that mayor to get tough,\u201d Trump said of Emanuel at a rally, \u201cbecause it\u2019s not working, what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nSome may recall it was in Chicago in June that a restaurant employee allegedly spat on the president\u2019s son Eric Trump, prompting Lightfoot to condemn the \u201crepugnant\u201d behavior and issue a statement reminding city residents that \u201ccivility matters.\u201d\n\nWhat Trump plans to say to his police audience Monday remains unknown. But in previous comments, the president has called law enforcement to use the controversial \u201cstop and frisk\u201d method as a way of reducing crime, and threatened to \u201csend in the feds\u201d if officials didn\u2019t successfully address the \u201ccarnage\u201d happening on the city\u2019s streets.\n\nWhile the president is in town, he\u2019ll also be attending a Trump 2020 campaign fundraiser, with prices ranging from $2,800 for lunch to $35,000 for a photo with the president, to $100,000 for a seat at a roundtable meeting with trump. In addition, the Trump campaign will extend an \u201cVIP\u201d invitation to a lucky grassroots-level donor whose name is selected in a drawing, the Chicago Tribune reported.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump\u2019s last visit to Chicago came just days before his 2016 election victory over Hillary Clinton, according to the newspaper.\n\nTrump has visited other parts of Illinois as president, including Granite City near St. Louis and Murphysboro, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.", "description": "When President Trump speaks at a police gathering in Chicago next week, the city\u2019s police superintendent reportedly plans to be elsewhere.", "authors": ["Dom Calicchio"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/AP-Eddie-Johnson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
