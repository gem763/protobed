Thousands of IS prisoners are held in Kurdish-run camps in the region.\n\nEurope has taken an increasingly tough line with Turkey and several countries, including Britain, France and Germany, have imposed arms embargoes on Ankara over the operation.\n\n\u2013 Jihadist fears \u2013\n\nThe UN Security Council warned in a unanimously adopted statement of a risk of \u201cdispersion\u201d of jihadist prisoners, but stopped short of calling for an end to Turkey\u2019s offensive.\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said Wednesday they were \u201cfreezing\u201d operations against IS.\n\nThe force\u2019s head Mazloum Abdi told Kurdish television channel Ronahi it would make do with \u201cdefensive\u201d operations against the group, which maintains sleeper cells and a presence in Syria\u2019s vast desert despite its territorial defeat.\n\nSince launching their assault on October 9, Turkey and its Syrian proxies have secured more than 100 kilometres (60 miles) of the border, but Ras al-Ain has held out.\n\nErdogan wants to create a buffer zone stretching 30 kilometres from the border into Syrian territory.\n\nHe wants to destroy Kurdish hopes of an autonomous enclave that Turkey fears could serve as a launchpad for attacks on its soil, and to resettle some of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees Ankara is hosting.\n\nburs/raz/ach", "description": "Ankara (AFP) \u2013 US Vice President Mike Pence arrived in Turkey Thursday to push President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for a ceasefire in Syria after Ankara", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/47046d_turkish-forces-fired-missile-syrian-town-ras-al-ain-turkish-border-us-demands-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
