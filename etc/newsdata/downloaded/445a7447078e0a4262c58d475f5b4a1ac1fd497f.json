In reporting on a series of social media posts from Department of Labor official Leif Olson, we failed to meet our editorial standards for fairness and accuracy,\" the retraction said. \"We regret that lapse and apologize to our readers and to Mr. Olson.\"\n\nCritics spoke out last month after Olson resigned following a Bloomberg Law reporter asking about old Facebook posts that he labeled anti-Semitic. Others contended that the postings were \"obviously sarcastic.\"\n\nCONTROVERSY RAGES OVER RESIGNATION OF TRUMP LABOR DEPT. STAFFER AFTER REPORT ON OLD FACEBOOK POSTS\n\nReporter Ben Penn published a piece headlined, \u201cTrump Labor Aide Quits After Anti-Semitic Facebook Posts Surface,\u201d detailing Olson\u2019s sudden resignation, which occurred days before the story's publication.\n\nOlson resigned from his position after the reporter asked the DOL for comment on Facebook posts from 2016 when Paul Nehlen lost to Paul Ryan in the Wisconsin Republican congressional primary.\n\n\u201cOlson, an unsuccessful GOP candidate in 2012 for a Texas district court judgeship, fired off a series of late-night posts on his personal Facebook page three years ago that started as a sarcastic quip about former House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s blowout primary victory. They then devolved into an exchange referencing two anti-Semitic tropes: that Jews control the media and that they look out for members of their own faith,\u201d Penn wrote.\n\nOlson was a Ryan supporter in 2016 when his primary opponent was Nehlen, a self-described \u201cpro-White\u201d candidate with a history of defending white supremacist messages on social media. Olson took to Facebook after Ryan's victory and appeared to mock a Nehlen supporter with a series of messages.\n\nDES MOINES REGISTER REPORTER OUT FOR OLD RACIST TWEETS AFTER DIGGING UP TWEETS OF IOWAN PHILANTHROPIST\n\nOlson told Penn that the remarks were simply \u201csarcastic criticism of the alt-right\u2019s conspiracy theories and anti-Semitic positions\u201d and declined to comment on why he resigned from his job as a senior policy adviser.\n\nPenn noted that \u201ca review of a decade of Olson\u2019s Facebook posts shows that he usually promotes his Christian faith and conservative views\u201d and the \u201cRyan exchange appears to be the only appeal to Jewish stereotypes.\u201d\n\nMedia members on both sides of the political spectrum scolded Penn over the report at the time.\n\n\u201cThis article is a joke. The comments in question are so obviously sarcastic it would take willful blindness to miss it,\u201d conservative commentator Ben Shapiro wrote.\n\nNew York magazine writer Jonathan Chait called the situation \u201cterribly unfair\u201d and laid out his reasoning in a series of tweets.\n\n\u201cTrump Labor official Leif Olson has resigned due to a putatively anti-Semitic Facebook post. But if you read the post, it appears to be mocking anti-Semitic conspiracy theories,\u201d Chait wrote. \u201cLet's walk through it. The context for the post is a primary challenge to Paul Ryan by anti-Semitic right-winger Paul Nehlen. \u2026 In the post that got him fired, Olson was mocking Nehlen and the logic of his supporters.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThe next day, Olson was reinstated at the Department of Labor.\n\n\"Following a thorough reexamination of the available information and upon reflection, the Department has concluded that Mr. Olson has satisfactorily explained the tone of the content of his sarcastic social media posts and will return to his position in the Wage and Hour Division,\" the Department of Labor (DOL) announced in a statement.\n\nFox News' Brian Flood and Gregg Re contributed to this report.", "description": "It has been over a month since Bloomberg Law faced backlash over a report about a Labor Department official's social media posts, but the news outlet officially retracted the story on Friday and offered an apology.", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
