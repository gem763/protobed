More\n\n\u201cI think I was just staring at the situation,\u201d she recalled.\n\nMs Engler thinks she may have seen the same python about a week before it showed up feasting on an early morning meal in her dunny.\n\n\u201cWe were over at a neighbour\u2019s house and the dogs were going nuts in the garden and then we went outside and we saw it slithering over to my house and up a tree next to myself.\u201d\n\nMs Engler\u2019s six-year-old son had to be up early as he too was going to the markets. Although her son, TJ, isn\u2019t too keen on touching snakes, he is \u201cinterested\u201d in them. So Ms Engler took full advantage of the moment and quickly got the youngster out of bed to bear witness to the situation.\n\nMs Engler shut the door and trapped the snake in the bathroom before returning a few hours later with a snake catcher.\n\n\u201cI would not have opened the door again,\u201d Ms Engler admits. \u201cI don\u2019t know where it would have been.\u201d\n\nBut all that remained in the toilet bowl was a single dead rat.\n\n\u201cWhen he [the snake catcher] came, he went in there and he thought it might be under the rim, like where the water comes out,\u201d Ms Engler recalled. \u201cSo he was heating up the toilet with a hair dryer and looking for it, but it had disappeared.\u201d\n\nWhen Jana Engler returned home, the snake was nowhere to be found. Source: Supplied, Jana Engler. More\n\nMs Engler explained that the only way the snake could have got out was by going down the drain, which is probably how it got in the toilet in the first place.\n\n\u201cWe had a look at the plumbing and how it goes under the house from the toilet. There\u2019s this little air pipe that goes up on to the top of the roof.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really dry in Cairns, so the rats might have gone into the pipe to drink. And the snake might have picked them up and gone after them down that air pipe and they had nowhere else to go other than into the water and then up into the toilet bowl where they couldn\u2019t get out.\u201d\n\nDo you have a story tip?
