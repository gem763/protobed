However, the rule was poorly written \u2014 and the temporary reprieve was accidentally made permanent on some wells.\n\nAs a result, some of the biggest oil companies in the world, including Chevron, Shell, BP, Exxon Mobil and others, have avoided paying at least $18 billion in royalties on oil and gas drill ed since 1996 , according to a new report from the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan agency that works for Congress . The companies, which hold government leases to drill in the Gulf, continue to extract oil and gas from those wells while not being required to pay royaltie s, a right the industry has gone to court to defend.\n\nA spokesman for the industry group the American Petroleum Institute, which represents many of the companies affected, said courts had \u201cruled there was nothing ambiguous about the 1995 act.\u201d The companies \u201ctook Congress at its word,\u201d said the spokesman, Ben Marter, and any attempts to revisit the issue would be \u201cengaging in a dangerous game of bait-and-switch.\u201d", "description": "A 1990s effort to encourage drilling in the Gulf of Mexico has cost the government $18 billion in lost revenue from oil royalties, according to a new report.", "authors": ["Hiroko Tabuchi"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/24/climate/24CLI-OIL/24CLI-OIL-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
