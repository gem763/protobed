Four years later, coroner Frances Kirkham made several recommendations to then-communities secretary Eric Pickles. These included \u201cencouraging\u201d housing providers to retrofit sprinklers in tower blocks, and a government review of fire safety guidance.\n\nCladding added to the Grenfell block in a refurbishment overseen by the council was later blamed for spreading the flames so quickly there was no time to get them under control. The intended improvements had in fact turned the tower block into a \u201cdeath trap\u201d, the inquiry has heard. Hundreds of buildings in the UK are still clad in similar material, and are likely to remain so for at least another 10 years.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Any decision to call a witness will be based on the evidence they may be able to provide as relevant to the issues being investigated by the inquiry in phase two.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere have been no criminal charges relating to Grenfell so far and, according to a statement from the Metropolitan Police in March this year, none are expected until 2021.\n\nThe first phase of the probe, which took place over 123 days between May and December 2018, focused on finding out exactly what happened on 14 June. It heard 140 witness testimonies and received 500,000 documents relevant to both the first and upcoming second phase.\n\nBut bereaved families and survivors, who were expecting to hear the conclusions of what happened by spring this year, were outraged when it was announced the first report was to be pushed back to October.\n\nThis has caused a delay to the second phase of the inquiry, which will not now begin until January 2020 when it will focus on how Grenfell Tower was allowed to become such a risk to its inhabitants.\n\nMr Mason said the new North Kensington People\u2019s Convention would work towards devolving powers to residents in the area and is a \u201cresponse to RBKC\u2019s failure to listen to the Grenfell bereaved families and survivors and the population of North Kensington\u201d.\n\nHe added the plan to launch the convention was decided after 13 North Kensington Labour councillors voted to boycott RBKC\u2019s new \u201cGrenfell Community Assembly\u201d, which the authority set up after scrapping a committee tasked with scrutinising its response to the fire.\n\nMr Mason said the replacement scrutiny system \u201cis not fit for purpose, won\u2019t properly hold the council leadership to account, and will not, as promised, put more power into local people\u2019s hands\u201d.\n\nIn a statement, RBKC council leader Elizabeth Campbell told The Independent: \u201cAfter months of consultation and discussion, scrutiny of the council is being strengthened.\n\n\u201cSeparate to our scrutiny committees, the new Grenfell Community Assembly will meet for the first time on 24 September and gives the opportunity for the community to ask questions and get answers they need directly from all the agencies involved in the Grenfell recovery.\u201d\n\nBut Mr Mason said the Grenfell and wider North Kensington community did not ask for this change and did not want it. He said the Labour opposition has a \u201cduty to scrutinise council decisions\u201d.\n\nThe people\u2019s convention, he said, would now \u201cplan how we are going to force RBKC to listen to the voices of Grenfell and North Kensington\u201d.\n\nHe said it would begin by asking residents what kind of devolution and council services they wanted, and would \u201cchallenge government to radically reform fire safety and building regulations, and campaign on soil contamination and social housing issues\u201d.\n\nThe group will have its first meeting at the Maxilla Club in Ladbroke Grove on 9 October with speakers including Kensington MP Emma Dent Coad, Labour councillor Mohammed Bakhtiar, former Grenfell Recovery Scrutiny Committee chair Marwan Elnaghi, and former chair of the Housing and Property Scrutiny Committee Kasim Ali.", "description": "Theresa May and David Cameron should be called before the inquiry into the Grenfell disaster to account for missed opportunities to prevent it, councillors are demanding.
