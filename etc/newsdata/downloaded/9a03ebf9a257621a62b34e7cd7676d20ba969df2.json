To the broader community, who rallied in such passionate support for our daughter, we apologize for betraying your trust.\"\n\nAmid the firestorm of the impeachment inquiry, Keilar's show devoted almost two minutes to the story. In the on-air segment, Keilar made note that Second Lady Karen Pence taught at the school part-time. While CNN published a story on Monday about the family's statement, Keilar herself did not provide an update to the story on Monday or Tuesday.\n\nAn on-air correction came later in the day at the top of the 3:00 hour on Monday from anchor Brooke Baldwin.\n\nIn a statement to Townhall, CNN said, \"Brianna first reported the story in the 2 p.m. hour on Friday, as she was anchoring special programming. The story update then aired in the same hour - 2 p.m. yesterday.\"\n\nFor clarification, it appears the update came at the top of the 3:00 hour.\n\nOthers who pounced on the story and have yet to issue an update or correction include Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who sent a tweet on September 28, but has not sent another tweet about the incident.\n\nYou are beautiful, Amari Allen. You are courageous & strong. You are loved.\n\n\n\nYou see, Amari, you may not feel it now, but you have a power that threatens their core. I can't wait to watch you use it and thrive.\n\n\n\nStay strong. https://t.co/57rtAYby3h \u2014 Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) September 28, 2019\n\nEditor's Note: This post has been updated with comment and clarification from CNN.", "description": ".10/01/2019 20:34:30PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/274/c60185aa-01da-4de7-afc5-409626618361.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
