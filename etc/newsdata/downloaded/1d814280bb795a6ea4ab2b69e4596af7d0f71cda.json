It is funded by the state government.\n\nThe Shi\u2019ite ideology \u201censnares its victims\u201d through educational institutions, children\u2019s books, novels, comics, among others, the department said in the sermon said.\n\n\u201cThe Muslim ummah must become the eyes and the ears for the religious authorities when stumbling upon activities that are suspicious, disguising under the pretext of Islam,\u201d it said.\n\nThe department described Shi\u2019ite practices as \u201cextremist\u201d and \u201cnauseating\u201d.\n\nReuters could not establish if the sermon criticising Shi\u2019ites was delivered at all mosques in the state. But religious experts said mosques typically follow the sermon issued by the state religious authority.\n\nIsham Pawan Ahmad, an associate professor at the International Islamic University near Kuala Lumpur, said the sermon delivered at a mosque he went to in Selangor on Friday was similar to the one issued by JAIS.\n\n\u201cThis is the most vehement comment on Shi\u2019ites in Malaysia. It makes them a target,\u201d Isham said.\n\nShi\u2019ites are a minority is Malaysia, with some estimating their numbers in only the tens of thousands.\n\nShi\u2019ite community leaders were not immediately available for comment.\n\nIn 1996, a Malaysian Islamic body issued a fatwa, an Islamic ruling, recognising Sunni Islam as the faith of Malaysian Muslims.\n\nMalaysian Shi\u2019ite Muslims have complained about their inability to worship freely, and that they may face obstacles in carrying out rituals which are both cultural and religious, the U.N. special rapporteur in the field of cultural rights said in a preliminary report in 2017.", "description": "Religious authorities in a Malaysian state denounced Shi'ite Islam on Friday and asked mosques to call in sermons on their congregations to be vigilant over the spread of the \"deviant teachings\" of the Shi'ite sect.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
