USA TODAY\n\nIt wasn't always pretty, but No. 3 LSU ground out a 23-20 defeat of No. 10 Auburn in the annual \"Tiger Bowl\" on Saturday at Louisiana State's Tiger Stadium.\n\nLSU put up a season low in points, thanks in part to a strong performance from Auburn's defense, but quarterback Joe Burrow and running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire provided enough offense in the second half to secure the victory.\n\nThe victory sets up a massive showdown with No. 1 Alabama at Bryant-Denny Stadium in two weeks that will likely determine the winner of the SEC West. The Crimson Tide play Arkansas later Saturday.\n\nLSU Tigers quarterback Joe Burrow (9) celebrates with running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire after a touchdown run against the Auburn Tigers during the third quarter at Tiger Stadium.

He nearly scored but stepped out of bounds at the LSU 9-yard line, and LSU was able to hold Auburn to the field goal.\n\nLSU then drove down the field but turned the ball over on downs when Auburn stopped wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase on fourth down.\n\nTOO GOOD: Big-time players have Ohio State looking like the No. 1 team\n\nSILVER LINING: The one good thing for Oklahoma in loss to Kansas State\n\nAuburn proceeded to go three-and-out, and though it picked off Burrow on LSU's subsequent possession it went three-and-out again.\n\nLSU finally jumped into the lead again, 16-13, at 4:58 of the third quarter on Edwards-Helaire's touchdown run. After yet another Auburn three-and-out, LSU pushed its lead to 23-13 on Burrow's 7-yard touchdown run.\n\nOn LSU's side, Burrow, a favorite for the Heisman Trophy, had another strong game going 32-for-42 for 321 yards with a passing and running touchdown. Edwards-Helaire managed 137 yards on 25 carries to go with his one touchdown.\n\nFreshman QB Bo Nix had a brutal game for Auburn. He finished just 15-for-35 for 157 yards with an interception and a late touchdown pass that cut the deficit to three.\n\nOverall, LSU outgained Auburn 508-287.", "description": "LSU set a season low for scoring but it still beat Auburn 23-20 in a battle of Tigers that sets up a massive showdown with No. 1 Alabama in two weeks.", "authors": ["Jace Evans", "Published P.M.
