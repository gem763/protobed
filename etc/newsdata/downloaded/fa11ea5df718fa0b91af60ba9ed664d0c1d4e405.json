Here are the financial figures that the candidates, including President Trump, have reported to the Federal Election Commission, so far. The president's totals include money that other committees, such as the Republican National Committee and the Trump Victory Committee, have transferred to him.\n\nThese numbers reflect the total amount raised through the third quarter of 2019.
