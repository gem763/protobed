Mr. Biden spent the first two debates facing intense criticism from his opponents, a reflection in part of his current standing atop the polls, and his campaign is bracing for more broadsides from all across the stage.\n\nAllies noted that Mr. Biden has survived rough debate performances before, with little lasting impact on his national poll numbers. That, they argue, is evidence of the deep-seated good will that Mr. Biden, President Barack Obama\u2019s vice president, continues to enjoy from the Democratic base.\n\n[Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.]\n\nThey also see several opportunities for him to draw contrasts that could work to his benefit. That list includes emphasizing his foreign policy credentials \u2014 as a former vice president and a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \u2014 amid several prominent foreign policy-related controversies involving the Trump administration. His team is convinced that the Democratic electorate is far more moderate than some activists suggest, and welcomes a debate over issues like health care \u2014 Mr. Biden supports a public option but opposes eliminating private insurance, something Ms. Warren supports under \u201cMedicare for all\u201d \u2014 and which social programs should be offered for free. And allies are eager to deepen an argument Mr. Biden has been previewing: that it is not enough to have ambitious plans if those proposals cannot survive the political realities of Washington.\n\n\u201cLots of other candidates have great plans, they have good policy papers, many of them have, you know, talked about them on college campuses or in the Senate,\u201d said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware. \u201cThe difference, I think, is that Joe has decades of actual experience getting things enacted in a bitterly divided and partisan Washington, and I think he can and should point to that.\u201d\n\nMs. Warren did not face significant scrutiny from other leading contenders in the first two debates. Mr. Biden\u2019s allies are privately hopeful that she will be pressed on the details and practicalities of her proposals by several of the candidates onstage, as her formidable standing in the race now makes her a bigger target for attacks.\n\nMs. Warren pitches herself in a very different way than Mr. Biden does \u2014 her entire candidacy revolves around the idea of championing sweeping change.\n\n\u201cWe start with a plan, and then we get out there and fight for it,\u201d she told reporters in Austin, Tex., on Tuesday, when she was asked about Mr. Biden\u2019s focus on what progressive proposals are achievable. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s what being president is all about. It\u2019s about laying those plans out and showing the direction for this country, and then getting in the fight, leading the fight and bringing people along.\u201d", "description": "Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden arrive at Thursday\u2019s forum with contrasting styles and policies \u2014 tensions that will be laid bare as they appear onstage together for the first time.", "authors": ["Thomas Kaplan", "Katie Glueck"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/11/us/politics/11biden-warren/11biden-warren-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
