When she was just 14, her family was deported to Colombia, leaving her alone in the United States to figure out her future at a young age.\n\n\u201cI experienced a very full childhood, so when it was taken away, it was like the wind had been knocked out of me,\u201d Guerrero told HuffPost in an interview. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait to learn how to drive. I couldn\u2019t wait to go to prom. I couldn\u2019t wait to sing in my senior recital and have my parents see that, and, unfortunately, that time never came.\u201d\n\nNow, seeing news headlines that mirror her own story of deportation and family separation, the 33-year-old actor uses her platform to demand political reform, shift the narrative on immigration and stand up for her community.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen so many attacks on our community, from the 700 people who were detained in Mississippi, most of them parents, to the attacks in El Paso and the children in cages that\u2019s been happening for two years,\u201d Guerrero said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible that people still are not able to see how this is wrong and how we need to change the system.\u201d\n\nDecades later, the \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d star is still reeling from the trauma of her family\u2019s deportation. Since she was a young child, her parents had been candid with her about their undocumented status. Guerrero, who has birthright citizenship, lived in fear that one day she would return home to find her family gone \u2014 a fear that eventually materialized.\n\n\u201cThe first thing that a child feels regardless of the facts is that it is their fault,\u201d Guerrero said. \u201cIn any circumstances, whether the child stays behind or the child has to go back, it\u2019s that \u2014 they internalize it.\u201d\n\nShe says her path to stardom has been \u201cpure luck\u201d and suggests there could have been many different outcomes to her journey following the trauma of her childhood. She says the sound of the phone ringing or of sirens outside made her uneasy from a young age. The constant anxiety about her family\u2019s fate haunted her.\n\n\u201cI internalized it and said, \u2018What did I do? What did I do to make this happen?\u2019\u201d Guerrero said. \u201cAnd so you live your life sort of walking on eggshells, fearing that your life is just going to implode at any minute or that you\u2019ll ... ruin somebody else\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nPaul Morigi via Getty Images WASHINGTON, DC - JUNE 30: Actor Diane Guerrero speaks at Families Belong Together Rally In Washington DC Sponsored By MoveOn, National Domestic Workers Alliance, And Hundreds Of Allies.\n\nGuerrero uses this trauma in her work to advocate for immigrant communities, to promote awareness about the flaws in the immigration system and tell the stories of families like her own who simply wanted a better life for themselves.\n\n\u201cDo you really think my fight is about open borders?\u201d Guerrero said. \u201cAbsolutely not. It\u2019s about comprehensive immigration reform. It\u2019s about starting a new system that is going to work because the system that is in place at the moment \u2014 it is set up to fail.\u201d\n\nGuerrero got her start as an actor by taking classes and auditioning for people\u2019s music videos in their backyards. She submitted herself for \u201canything and everything,\u201d eager to see just how far she could go.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s times where you\u2019re not where you want to be. It\u2019s hard when you start seeing people that are \u2018making it,\u2019 whatever that means to you, but it\u2019s a process,\u201d said Guerrero, who penned a memoir, \u201cIn the Country We Love,\u201d in 2016. \u201cAnd if you respect the work and you respect yourself, then you\u2019ll take your time.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, she landed the role of Maritza Ramos in the hit Netflix series \u201cOrange Is the New Black.\u201d Maritza is an inmate at Litchfield Penitentiary who finds herself in a privately run Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility by Season 7, which was released on the streaming service in late July.\n\nMaritza\u2019s story, along with those of several other inmates, depicts the heartbreaking reality for immigrants in detention facilities, and it\u2019s not far off from Guerrero\u2019s own story.\n\nCourtesy of NETFLIX Diane Guerrero in a scene from the final season of \u201cOrange is the New Black.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was inspired by Jenji Kohan and the creators of the show and also my incredible castmates who are also so outspoken about issues they\u2019re passionate about,\u201d Guerrero said. \u201cI was very motivated to speak about my life and be a source of change in my own way.\u201d\n\nMost recently, she played a misfit superhero named Crazy Jane in the first season of \u201cDoom Patrol,\u201d a DC Universe comic show. Her character has 64 personalities and 64 superpowers to match, which has allowed her to explore the many facets of the human psyche and the importance of mental health.\n\nGuerrero is also known for playing Lina on \u201cJane the Virgin,\u201d a heartwarming, comedic telenovela about a Venezuelan-American author who is accidentally artificially inseminated and becomes pregnant.\n\nFor a long time, this country has had a problem imagining anyone other than white people have everyday normal experiences, to fantastical to the most traumatic. Diane Guerrero, actor and immigration advocate\n\nFor Guerrero, playing these wildly different roles means that she gets to break stereotypes and reflect what the world and what her community in particular actually look like.\n\n\u201cI played an inmate at a jail because that is a real story,\u201d Guerrero said. \u201cOn the other hand, another real story is a young woman who wants to be a writer, who can experience artificial insemination in the weirdest way. For a long time, this country has had a problem imagining anyone other than white people have everyday normal experiences, to fantastical to the most traumatic.\u201d\n\nThe millions of viewers who watch Guerrero take on these different roles learn about the issues that affect immigrants, whether that\u2019s traditional Hispanic cultural values or the prison system. Guerrero said she has received feedback from friends and family who have been educated through her roles on popular television shows.\n\nWithout a strong community and a support system of family and friends who took care of her, Guerrero said, she wouldn\u2019t be where she is today. She also credits her mother, father and brother for teaching her powerful values from their Colombian heritage.\n\nTina Turnbow\n\n\u201cThey showed me a world of possibilities, and that really stuck with me,\u201d Guerrero said. \u201cMy dad would always show me to hold my head up high when I\u2019m dancing because that is to show security and to show power and elegance.\u201d\n\nGuerrero said she hopes her work reaches out to children and people with similar experiences as her own and lets them know they have an entire community behind them that understands their pain.\n\n\u201cMy community is represented in me and everything that I do,\u201d Guerrero said. \u201cSo that\u2019s what I love the most out of being the actor. I know little girls can look at me and see me and say, \u2018Oh, I recognize that love.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd hopefully her acting, storytelling and advocacy will motivate others to stand up for themselves and seek help when they need it.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing you can do for yourself is give yourself a chance,\u201d Guerrero said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I did. \u2026 You don\u2019t have to start out knowing all of these things or being the best. You have a place in this world.\u201d\n\nNuestras Voces Unidas (Our Voices United) is a HuffPost series created to honor Hispanic Heritage Month and amplify the diverse voices within the community.
