The approval came last Friday, UPS disclosed.\n\nUPS says it immediately launched the first drone delivery flight by any company under what is known as the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s Part 135 Standard at WakeMed\u2019s hospital campus in Raleigh, N.C. The flight was flown under a government exemption allowing for \u201cbeyond visual line of sight\u201d operation.\n\n\u201cThis is history in the making, and we aren\u2019t done yet,\u201d said UPS CEO David Abney in a statement. \u201cOur technology is opening doors for UPS and solving problems in unique ways for our customers. We will soon announce other steps to build out our infrastructure, expand services for healthcare customers and put drones to new uses in the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really substantial pivot,\u201d UPS chief strategy and transformation officer Scott Price tells Yahoo Finance.\n\nUPS also plans to expand its drone delivery service to those outside of the healthcare industry. A UPS spokesperson tells Yahoo Finance those other services initially could be drone service between other UPS sites and corporate campuses.\n\nPartnerships between UPS and major airlines are also being considered, according to UPS.\n\nReading between the lines, UPS looks poised to take the leadership role in drone delivery for big business and eventually consumers. It\u2019s unlikely UPS will be delivering packages to home residences at least until 2021 as the FAA continues to study safety protocol.\n\nOther companies like Alphabet (GOOGL) subsidiary Wing Aviation have been flying drone delivery test programs with similar restrictions. But Wing Aviation received Part 135 certification from the FAA in April and it plans to expand into commercial home delivery in Southwest Virginia with what it calls, \u201ca delivery trial\u201d later this year.\n\nYahoo Finance anchor Adam Shapiro contributed to this story.\n\nA drone demonstrates delivery capabilities from the top of a UPS truck during testing in Lithia, Florida, U.S. February 20, 2017.
