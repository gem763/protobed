(Marco Ugarte, File/Associated Press)\n\nMEXICO CITY \u2014 Expressionist painter Francisco Toledo, who was well-known and respected in Mexico both for his art and his activism, has died, the country\u2019s president announced late Thursday.\n\nPresident Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador wrote in his Twitter account that \u201cart is mourning.\u201d He called the 79-year-old Toledo \u201can authentic defender of nature, customs and traditions of our people.\u201d\n\nThe artist\u2019s family later confirmed his death on his Facebook page. They said a traditional offering to the dead was being up at one of the arts centers founded by Toledo in his native Oaxaca state.\n\nThe cause of death was not immediately disclosed.\n\nToledo\u2019s enigmatic paintings and sculptures were marked by the animals, colors and traditions of Oaxaca. Insects, cats, and other animals were presented in almost mythological contexts in Toledo\u2019s work, whose colors also evoked the brilliant palette of Oaxaca.\n\nHis activism was also centered in Oaxaca, particularly for saving its historic buildings and green spaces and defending against cultural encroachment.\n\nWild-haired and bearded, Toledo led movements to save old convents and other colonial-era buildings from developers and helped turn them into centers for the arts and gardens. He also led a fight in the early 2000s against the opening of a fast-food chain in downtown Oaxaca city, the state capital.\n\nCulture Secretary Alejandra Frausto wrote of the artist \u201csomething flowered at every step Toledo took.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
