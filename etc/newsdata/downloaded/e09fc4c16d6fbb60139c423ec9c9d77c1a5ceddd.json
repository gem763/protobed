Atletico Madrid midfielder Saul Niguez has also been monitored.\n\nIn the short-term, manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has asked his players to be more positive on the ball in a bid to rise up the table.\n\nManchester United will splash \u00a3300million on big name signings in the next transfer window\n\nUnited have been heavily linked with a big money move for Leicester star James Maddison\n\n\u2018The coaching here is excellent and we are just waiting for that to flourish,\u2019 said Solskjaer.\n\n'You can see loads of it, the defensive part, which is giving us a platform to play from. That last bit is going to come because we have players with that flair.\n\n\u2018Maybe young players want to play safe but you have to take risks at this club, you can\u2019t play safe. One of my big philosophies is you attack quickly. You want to win the ball in great positions to attack from, but teams are so quickly back into shape these days you lose that moment of transition in one or two less positive passes.\u2019\n\nSunday's game pits together England\u2019s most expensive defenders, \u00a380m Harry Maguire and Virgil van Dijk (\u00a375m). Solskjaer has backed Maguire despite an indifferent start, saying: \u2018Harry is a leader. It\u2019s just there are different types of leaders.\u2019", "description": "United have been heavily linked with Lyon striker Moussa Dembele and Leicester City playmaker James Maddison but are prepared to wait until the summer if neither is available at the right price.", "authors": ["Joe Bernstein For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/21/19935958-0-image-a-88_1571515858612.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
