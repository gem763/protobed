He has been minister of state for energy affairs since 2017. The two brothers are not known to be close.\n\nIt is the first time a member of the ruling Al Saud family has held the energy minister post in the world\u2019s top oil exporter.\n\nThe move, announced on Sunday, comes as Brent crude oil trades below $60 a barrel, well below the $80 to $85 a barrel that analysts say is needed to balance the Saudi budget.\n\nPrince Abdulaziz replaces Khalid al-Falih, who was removed just days ago as board chairman of the state-owned oil giant Aramco, a company that he once ran as CEO.\n\nAl-Falih, who was named energy minister in 2016, also had seen his cabinet portfolio diminished in a royal decree last week creating a new ministry of mining and industry, removing that sector from the purview of the energy ministry.\n\nThe changes come as Saudi Arabia renews its push to sell shares in Aramco as part of a wider plan by the crown prince to overhaul the economy and prepare the country for a future less dependent on oil.\n\nAramco\u2019s new board chairman, announced last week, is the finance-minded Yasir al-Rumayyan, who heads the Public Investment Fund, the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. Al-Rumayyan is also a close adviser to the crown prince.\n\nAustralia's arms deals unaacceptable on moral grounds, former defence official says Read more\n\nThe kingdom\u2019s new energy minister, Abdulaziz, was named deputy oil minister in 1995, a position he held for nearly a decade. He then served as assistant oil minister until 2017, when he was named minister of state for energy affairs, and has been a longstanding member of the country\u2019s delegation to Opec.\n\nSome industry insiders say the prince\u2019s lengthy experience has overcome what has been seen as the impossibility of appointing a royal to the post of energy minister. Saudi Arabia has had five oil ministers since 1960 and none of them has been a royal.\n\nConventional thinking has been that the ruling Al Saud family has viewed the oil portfolio as so important that giving it to a prince might upset the dynasty\u2019s delicate balance of power and risk making oil policy hostage to princely politicking, Saudi sources and diplomats say.\n\nThe king also issued a royal decree removing the current deputy minister of energy, Abdulaziz al-Abdulkarim. He did not name a new deputy energy minister.\n\nThe king did, however, name Osama bin Abdulaziz Al-Zamil as deputy minister for the new ministry of industry and mining. The decrees, issued early Sunday, were published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency.", "description": "Abdulaziz bin Salman becomes first Saudi royal to head energy ministry, one of the country\u2019s most vital roles", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11b349326562f5143386949f90a93a757be12a0a/0_0_2969_1781/master/2969.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0566d77b57ae8adb4a390d3de3fa507b", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
