Six people at the compound were arrested.\n\nImages taken from the Transformed Life Ministry, which were provided to Reuters by police, showed handcuffs hanging from beds and windowless cells more akin to dog kennels at a pound. The ministry was founded 19 years ago by a pastor, Glen Awong.\n\nPolice spokesman Wayne Mystar said all the people at the centre were nationals of Trinidad and Tobago. Police Commissioner Gary Griffith said the situation amounted to \u201chuman trafficking\u201d and added that the people who were rescued stated that some of them had been imprisoned for years and been tortured.\n\nThe rescued men and women, some as young as 20 and others 60 or older, were taken to health facilities for medical treatment, the police said.\n\nAccording to its website, Awong, while serving a seven-year term in prison, \u201canswered the call from God and started his ministry within the prison walls.\u201d\n\nAwong and the centre did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\u201cTransformed Life Ministry\u2019s mission is to serve male ex-prisoners and deportees, by providing safe transitional housing, developmental and rehabilitation programmes, to promote healthy reintegration into society,\u201d the centre says on the website.\n\nBut one person familiar with the centre strongly disagreed with that description, saying a family member who had stayed there was mistreated.\n\n\u201cI am familiar with the place because my son was there for a few months. I felt like my son was treated as a prisoner and not a patient,\u201d said Andrea De Silva, a photographer who has freelanced for Reuters on occasion.\n\nShe said that after her son tried to hang himself while at the centre she was never contacted about the attempted suicide or even allowed to see him.\n\n\u201cWe saw that Mickell was deteriorating and I decided to take him out,\u201d De Silva said.", "description": "Dozens of people were found on Wednesday in squalid conditions, chained and in cages in a Trinidad and Tobago rehabilitation centre run by a religious group for ex-prisoners and drug users, where some were tortured and held for years, police said.", "authors": ["Linda Hutchinson-Jafar", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
