Cuccinelli, pictured right, has said that he has been doing a good job of pursuing the president's agenda\n\nThe number of undocumented migrants is difficult to quantify, as individuals generally avoid situations where they could be counted. Yet, typical estimates range from between 11 and 14 million.\n\nCuccinelli, however, said it would be wise to work around the larger number.\n\n'That\u2019s the one I know. I just use it as a reference point. Because from an operational standpoint, it doesn\u2019t matter too much,' he said during a Christian Science Monitor event in Washington.\n\n'We deal with what\u2019s in front of us. So that\u2019s the perspective that I bring to it. It\u2019s useful to know. It\u2019s an important thing at a 100,000-foot level.'\n\nHe also spoke about demands of Democratic House members who would like to give amnesty to 800,000 young illegal immigrants.\n\n'They are here illegally,' Cucinelli said.\n\n'They are in the same pool, if MIT is correct, with the 22 million people who are here illegally.'\n\nCucinelli is widely seen as Trump's top pick for the new Director of Homeland Security.\n\nActing director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Ken Cuccinelli talks during a walk through of the Migration Protection Protocols Immigration Hearing Facility. Cuccinelli is emerging as the public face of the president's hard-line immigration policies.\n\nHe and the president appear to agree on an ever-tightening immigration policy.\n\n'In terms of pursuing the president\u2019s agenda, we\u2019ve been doing a good job at USCIS [US Citizenship and Immigration Services],' Cuccinelli said.\n\n'That\u2019s what I would ask those folks to be judging me on.'\n\nThe president stands adamant on his restrictive immigration policy and still calls for a wall to prevent immigrants from Mexico breaching the border.\n\nAccording to the immigration page on the White House website:\n\n'The United States must adopt an immigration system that serves the national interest.\n\n'To restore the rule of law and secure our border, President Trump is committed to constructing a border wall and ensuring the swift removal of unlawful entrants.\n\n'To protect American workers, the President supports ending chain migration, eliminating the Visa Lottery, and moving the country to a merit-based entry system.\n\n'These reforms will advance the safety and prosperity of all Americans while helping new citizens assimilate and flourish.\n\nDuring the event Cuccinelli went on to further align himself with Trump's immigration values:\n\nPeople protest against planned Trump administration cuts to the U.S. refugee resettlement program, in front of the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, U.S., October 15, 2019\n\n'The president has made no secret of the fact that he believes the American immigration system, first and foremost, is set up to work for America.\n\n'That means economically and for the people here, and to do that, we put out invitations and offerings to people from around the world, along the lines that Congress puts in the law.\n\n'There is a lot of pressure in various sectors to utilize more immigrant labor for employment, whether it\u2019s high tech or low tech \u2013 various parts of the economy....\n\n'I would say that really the long-term solution for that isn\u2019t on the horizon until the immigration reform that the president has talked about passes, and we restructure our immigration system to prioritize ... the employment side of immigration.'", "description": "US President Donald Trump's top immigration spokesman (Ken Cuccinelli, left) suggested the amount of illegal immigrants in the country could be double the most cited previous estimates.", "authors": ["Ryan Fahey For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/13/19836632-0-image-a-109_1571316755040.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
