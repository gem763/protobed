Now Sokomani has tattoos of his favourites - the Coral Tree, Speckboom and Acacia - twining across his shoulder.\n\nThe Speckboom is a favourite at Sokomani's Shoots and Roots nursery. Spekboom can grow almost anywhere and absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere faster than most other trees in dry conditions, the United Nations says.\n\nLast year Sokomani went back to his school to plant 67 trees on Mandela Day, symbolising the 67 years that Mandela spent in public service. He co-founded Township Farmers in 2017 to teach children about agriculture and plant trees in schools.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2018, South Africa lost 1.34 million hectares of tree cover, equivalent to a 22% decrease since 2000, according to Global Forest Watch, a monitoring organization run the Washington-based thinktank World Resource Institute.
