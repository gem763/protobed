(Image: Rama)\n\nRapid progress in research involving miniature human brains grown in a dish has led to a host of ethical concerns, particularly when these human brain cells are transplanted into nonhuman animals. A new paper evaluates the potential risks of creating \u201chumanised\u201d animals, while providing a pathway for scientists to move forward in this important area.\n\nNeuroscientist Isaac Chen from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, along with his colleagues, has written a timely Perspective paper published today in the science journal Cell Stem Cell.\n\nThe paper was prompted by recent breakthroughs involving the transplantation of human brain organoids into rodents \u2014 a practice that\u2019s led to concerns about the \u201chumanisation\u201d of lab animals.\n\nIn their paper, the authors evaluate the current limits of this biotechnology and the potential risks involved, while also looking ahead to the future. Chen and his colleagues don\u2019t believe anything needs to be done right now to limit these sorts of experiments, but that could change once scientists start to enhance certain types of brain functions in chimeric animals, that is, animals endowed with human attributes, in this case human brain cells.\n\nIn the future, the authors said, scientists will need to be wary of inducing robust levels of consciousness in chimeric animals and even stand-alone brain organoids, similar to the sci-fi image of a conscious brain in a vat.\n\nCross-section of a brain organoid. (Image: Trujillo et al., 2019, Cell Stem Cell)\n\nHuman brain organoids are proving to be remarkably useful. Made from human stem cells, brain organoids are tiny clumps of neural cells which scientists can use in their research.\n\nTo be clear, pea-sized organoids are far too basic to induce traits like consciousness, feelings, or any semblance of awareness, but because they consist of living human brain cells, scientists can use them to study brain development, cognitive disorders, and the way certain diseases affect the brain, among other things. And in fact, during the opening stages of the Zika outbreak, brain organoids were used to study how the virus infiltrates brain cells.\n\nThe use of brain organoids in this way is largely uncontroversial, but recent research involving the transplantation of human brain cells into rodent brains is leading to some serious ethical concerns, specifically the claim that scientists are creating part-human animals.\n\nAnders Sandberg, a researcher at the University of Oxford\u2019s Future of Humanity Institute, said scientists are not yet able to generate full-sized brains due to the lack of blood vessels, supporting structure, and other elements required to build a fully functioning brain. But that\u2019s where lab animals can come in handy.\n\n\u201cMaking organoids of human brain cells is obviously interesting both for regenerating brain damage and for research,\u201d explained Sandberg, who\u2019s not affiliated with the new paper. \u201cThey do gain some structure, even though it is not like a full brain or even part of a brain. One way of getting around the problem of the lack of blood vessels in a petri dish is to implant them in an animal,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s at this point when people start to get a bit nervous.\u201d\n\nThe concern, of course, is that the human neural cells, when transplanted into a nonhuman animal, say a mouse or rat, will somehow endow the creature with human-like traits, such as greater intelligence, more complex emotions, and so on. The question emerges as to whether such an animal deserves higher moral consideration, and by consequence, a different set of rules in terms of what\u2019s permissible in an experimental setting.\n\nResearch done in 2013, for example, highlighted the potential for human brain cells to affect the behaviour and capacities of nonhuman animals. In experiments, neuroscientists replaced around half of the mice brain with human cells, mostly glia, during development. As my coverage noted at the time, this intervention caused enhancements of the rodent\u2019s cognitive capacities, including \u201caugmentations to memory, learning, and adaptive conditioning.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, this tweak made the mice smarter, but smarter by mouse standards. In terms of their overall intelligence, the mice were still light-years removed from human-levels of intelligence. By the same token, and as the authors wrote in their paper, the \u201clikelihood that current iterations of organoids or animals transplanted with these organoids can develop more complex cognitive abilities is minute.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the authors say it\u2019s not useful to use terms like \u201chumanised\u201d or \u201chumanisation\u201d to describe these animals or the processes involved, as these descriptions aren\u2019t useful from a biological point of view. In this excellently argued excerpt from the new Perspective, the authors make their case:\n\nWhat does it mean for an animal transplanted with a brain organoid to become more \u201chuman\u201d? A common reply is that the chimera has assumed more \u201chuman-like\u201d characteristics, such as self-awareness, advanced cognitive capacities, and complex emotions. However, these traits may not be unique to human beings, a notion that has been discussed with respect to a range of non-human species and artificial intelligence. An alternative approach often taken in the ethical literature on chimeras is to consider whether these entities have attained moral equivalence to human beings. Several theories of moral status have been debated. One argument is that individuals should be accorded respect simply because of their membership in the human race. Extending this reasoning to human tissue, cells, and genes leads to the conclusion that a chimera harbouring any human components would automatically have its moral status elevated. Most scholars have rejected this line of reasoning because it does not hold up to biological scrutiny and is based on species-centric bias with no other logical basis. A more logically consistent argument for moral status is based on the premise that entities that are capable of making rational, conscious choices possess intrinsic moral value. Achieving this ability in a chimeric animal is a very high bar. Making rational, conscious choices may require the use of language to enable meta-cognition (i.e., thinking about thinking) and awareness of one\u2019s own mental states. Moreover, these abilities require years of social and educational nurturing to develop, even in humans. Therefore, discussions of the moral equivalency of \u201cextreme chimeras\u201d, self-aware animals with rational thought, may be less germane to the immediate issue of brain organoid transplantation.\n\nPersonally, I believe Chen and his co-authors are spot-on with this assessment (I also love that they brought up AI in this context, as I\u2019ve argued along similar lines).\n\nIndeed, the claim of \u201chumanisation\u201d smacks of human exceptionalism and speciesism. What would be more helpful, as the authors argue, is the identification of actual biological traits and functions that could potentially raise the moral value of a chimeric nonhuman animal (assuming, of course, that one doesn\u2019t already consider animals to have the highest moral worth and believe that animals shouldn\u2019t be experimented upon in any case).\n\nTo that end, Chen and his co-authors say scientists should be on the look-out for \u201caugmentations of discrete brain functions\u201d in chimeric animals that would raise their moral status. When asked which specific traits would warrant concern, Chen said there\u2019s no answer to this question at the moment.\n\n\u201cIt is something that requires additional thought and discussion in the scientific community working closely with bioethicists and other stakeholders,\u201d Chen wrote to Gizmodo. \u201cAs we discuss in the paper, it is likely the case that cognitive function is in a higher tier requiring more discussion than basic neurological functions like sensation and vision.\u201d\n\nTiers of brain function enhancement in chimeric animals: \u201cWe contend that not all types of brain function have the same import when considering their potential enhancement,\u201d the authors write in the new paper. (Image: H. I. Chen et al., 2019/Cell Stem Cell)\n\nThose \u201chigher tiers\u201d can include aspects associated with many types of cognitive functions, including attention and memory. As the authors explain, however, the enhancement of \u201ccerebral function in brain organoid chimeras is currently not feasible, and the degree to which an animal\u2019s brain can be enhanced, even if it were to be completely replaced with human neurons, has limits.\u201d\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s important to point out that scientists are very far from being able to evoke these higher-tier characteristics in, for example, a rodent brain.\n\nOrly Reiner, a molecular geneticist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, explained it to Gizmodo this way: \u201cthese technologies cannot offer human-cell driven brain activity over-riding host-based activity.\u201d In other words, the presence of human cells in a nonhuman animal\u2019s brain doesn\u2019t just suddenly make it a human brain \u2014 it\u2019s not like scientists have suddenly created a human mind trapped inside an animal\u2019s body.\n\nAt the same time, however, Reiner, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new paper, said a \u201ccrucial time point\u201d will occur once \u201cthese barriers are crossed.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cimportant to embrace new technologies,\u201d she said, but only when done in parallel with the promotion of \u201cpublic and ethical discussions to help in defining risks and adding precautions,\u201d Reiner wrote to Gizmodo.\n\nA concern expressed in the Perspective paper was the potential for an elevated level of consciousness to arise in chimeric animals. Most scientists agree that virtually all animals exhibit signs of being conscious, and the 2012 Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness basically says as much, but Chen said there\u2019s an important clinical distinction to be made between an animal\u2019s level of arousal and the content of its awareness.\n\n\u201cA chimeric animal that developed evidence of self-awareness and rational decision-making...would warrant a pause in the research and a broader discussion across society about the direction of this research.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnimals and humans that are healthy usually have normal levels of arousal, [meaning] how awake they are,\u201d he explained to Gizmodo.\n\n\u201cThe content of consciousness describes an organism\u2019s perception of their internal and external environments and often what most people refer to as \u2018consciousness.\u2019 However, the content of consciousness is not binary [i.e. it\u2019s either present or absent] and [it] covers a range of such perceptions, which are different among different animal species. In our paper, we discuss specifically qualities such as self-awareness and rational decision-making, which are at the high end of the range of the content of consciousness,\u201d wrote Chen.\n\nAccordingly, Chen and his co-authors are concerned that in the future, these biotechnologies might confer a more profound or robust level of self-awareness and sentience in a chimeric animal. The \u201cprospect of enhanced brain chimeras is likely still off in the future,\u201d said Chen, but \u201ca chimeric animal that developed evidence of self-awareness and rational decision-making \u2014 again, very unlikely at this time \u2014 would warrant a pause in the research and a broader discussion across society about the direction of this research.\u201d\n\nTo which he added: \u201cI think brain organoid generation and transplantation have enormous potential as models of brain development and brain diseases and as possible substrates for repairing damaged brain circuitry. I think there are hazards in carrying out any form of this research without thinking about the potential outcomes, developing methods for monitoring for these outcomes, and reviewing the broader ramifications of these outcomes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe potential generation of a \u2018self-aware\u2019 human brain organoid in a vat might create an ethical dilemma. If this is possible, we will need to address the moral status of these organoids.\u201d\n\nBiologist Alysson Muotri from UC San Diego School of Medicine said he doesn\u2019t have a problem with \u201ctranslating\u201d human brain organoids inside the brains of mice. For Muotri, a much more important issue is the speculative prospect of creating a sentient, self-aware human organoid outside the body \u2014 a concern shared by Chen and his colleagues.\n\n\u201cTo me, that\u2019s where the ethical concerns will become more evident and [will] need further discussions,\u201d Muotri, who\u2019s not affiliated with the Perspective paper, told Gizmodo. \u201cThe potential generation of a \u2018self-aware\u2019 human brain organoid in a vat might create an ethical dilemma. If this is possible, we will need to address the moral status of these organoids. Similar to human subjects in clinical trials or animals for research, the moral status will dictate how and when to use human brain organoids in future research,\u201d he said.\n\nArnold Kriegstein, a professor of stem cell and tissue biology at UC San Francisco, also not involved with the Perspective, agrees with the authors that current methods using human brain organoids aren\u2019t resulting in profound cognitive changes.\n\n\u201cBut, the authors wisely raise the possibility that certain chimeras could potentially enhance specific brain functions,\u201d Kriegstein told Gizmodo in an email. \u201cThis concern has already been realised by the creation of mice\u2026[that] perform better than native mice on a battery of learning tests,\u201d in reference to the aforementioned study from 2013.\n\n\u201cThus, the potential of chimeras to manifest enhancement of brain function is a near-term concern, while sentience or self-awareness is a distant future possibility. Nonetheless, as thoughtfully articulated here, the potential behavioural consequences of chimerisation should be a concern of all scientists creating human-animal brain chimeras.\u201d\n\nReiner said now is a good time to advance this conversation, as the technology is developing rapidly. A \u201cdiscussion is needed to set the grounds for future advances that will require setting specific frames for the use of these new technologies so that they will be based on concrete data and not \u2018fake news,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nSandberg thought the arguments posed in the paper were \u201creasonable,\u201d but he\u2019s more concerned with another issue: the potential for suffering.\n\n\u201cCan organoids suffer?\u201d he asked. \u201cThis is a tough question. A random ball of neurons with no senses do not seem likely to have an inner world. Yet we can get pain from nerve damage that causes the wrong cross-connections \u2014 but that may still require a conscious brain to interpret the random signals as pain. So while I think an organoid in a petri dish is less likely to suffer than a non-random nervous system, when implanting it into a brain it might actually make the brain experience bad things.\u201d\n\nSandberg said experimenters need to be aware of this possibility and assess whether their chimeric animals might be in distress. He said \u201codd states\u201d might exist in which the \u201cpotentially exotic wiring of these systems might be harder to notice than regular pain.\u201d Ultimately, \u201csome caution is needed,\u201d according to Sandberg. \u201cIt does not mean we should stop researching, but we may need to look carefully.\u201d\n\nSandberg brought up a quote from the English philosopher Jeremy Bentham, who famously said, \u201cThe question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?\u201d", "description": "Rapid progress in research involving miniature human brains grown in a dish has led to a host of ethical concerns, particularly when these human brain cells are transplanted into nonhuman animals.
