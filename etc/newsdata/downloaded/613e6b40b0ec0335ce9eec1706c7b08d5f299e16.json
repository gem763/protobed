Clarence Smoyer will get his due on Wednesday morning.\n\nIn a surprise ceremony at the World War II Memorial on the National Mall, the Army will make Mr. Smoyer its latest war hero. The 95-year-old native of Allentown, Pennsylvania, will be awarded a Bronze Star for valorous actions that won him the nickname \u201cThe Hero of Cologne.\u201d\n\nThe long-deserved award will be presented as the result of a military review board decision, said Adam Makos, a military historian whose bestselling book \u201cSpearhead\u201d chronicles the closing days of the European theater for Mr. Smoyer and his crew, who were manning the Army\u2019s fleet of tanks.\n\nMr. Smoyer, who thinks he is in Washington solely to partake in some sightseeing and other tourist activities, will be hailed Wednesday as the hero whom many already see.\n\nAn Army spokesman confirmed the ceremony to The Washington Times.\n\nFormer Sen. Bob Dole, a decorated World War II veteran, and Fred Smith, CEO of FedEx, helped found the World War II Memorial. Both are scheduled to attend Mr. Smoyer\u2019s ceremony, which will include a Sherman tank and more than 100 World War II veterans to celebrate with him.\n\nIt will be a fitting event for a former soldier some consider to be the preeminent American tank gunner during the war. With a personal motto of \u201cshoot fast and shoot straight,\u201d he destroyed an unprecedented five Nazi tanks, but his most dramatic exchange occurred beneath the Cologne Cathedral.\n\nOn March 6, 1945, as U.S. forces pushed east into Germany and toward Berlin, Mr. Smoyer operated his tank\u2019s cannon and bested a Panther-class tank, which had seemed an invincible armored artillery vehicle. Earlier that day, the Nazi tank destroyed two U.S. tanks and killed three GIs.\n\n\u201cA bird passing overhead would have seen two armored beasts blindly searching for each other,\u201d Mr. Makos wrote in \u201cSpearhead.\u201d \u201cGoing up one street \u2014 a Pershing with its gun pointed to the right as it prepared to breach the corner. Around that corner \u2014 a stationary Panther with its gun targeting the intersection the Pershing was heading toward.\u201d\n\nU.S. forces needed to secure an important bridge over the Rhine River at Cologne, but the Nazi tank stood in the way.\n\n\u201cClarence\u2019s heart seized as the Panther slid into his sights,\u201d Mr. Makos wrote. \u201cBetween the rubble and the dangling streetcar lines, all he saw was the black hole of its muzzle.\u201d\n\nMr. Smoyer fired three shells into the Panther, sending smoke and flame up toward the spires of the soot-choked Cologne Cathedral. A roguish picture of Mr. Smoyer and his crew was captured atop the Pershing, and Mr. Smoyer was told that he would receive a military honor.\n\nBut days later, U.S. officers spotted Mr. Smoyer speaking with German children in the battle\u2019s aftermath. The children \u2014 traumatized from living in a war zone \u2014 asked for bubble gum and tugged at Mr. Smoyer\u2019s sleeves.\n\nMr. Smoyer bent down to say hello and explained that he had only cigarettes when the military police spotted him violating the Army\u2019s policy against fraternization, according to the account in \u201cSpearhead.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey just wanted bubble gum and I was still searching my pockets when a jeep full of MPs turned the corner,\u201d Mr. Smoyer said in a Q&A released by Mr. Makos\u2019 publisher. \u201cI could have avoided all that if I just had a stick of gum!\u201d\n\nMr. Smoyer\u2019s tank command and an accompanying journalist received Bronze Stars, but the Army did not award the gunner or his crew.\n\nThe Bronze Star is awarded to those serving in the U.S. armed forces who distinguish themselves by heroic or meritorious achievement or service.\n\nAccording to records kept by the U.S. military at Fort Knox, nearly 400,000 Bronze Stars were awarded during World War II and more than 700,000 for Vietnam.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
