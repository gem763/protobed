A sophomore a few towns over was thinking about moving. Apparently his dad had quarterbacked Texas A&M and now trained passers, including the kid, who had been diagnosing defenses and throwing routes since he was 8.\n\nThis sounded great to the folks in Allen. Their Eagles, one of the most prominent high school football teams in Texas and the country, were opening a palatial, $60 million stadium that fall, but they lacked a true signal caller.\n\nThen, during one workout that summer of 2012, Kyler Murray appeared.\n\n\u201cWe were all anticipating him,\u201d said Geno Pierce, a team parent. \u201cHe showed up, and he was a real little guy. We were all like, \u2018This is it?\u2019 \u201d\n\nNo one, not even Kyler or his father, Kevin, could\u2019ve known what the roughly 5-foot-5, 130-pound kid would become. Back then, the 14-year-old couldn\u2019t overhead-press a weighted barbell. He needed the younger kids\u2019 training bar.\n\nSeven summers later, now 22, 5-foot-10 and 207 pounds \u2014 still small by football standards \u2014 Murray stepped onto a practice field in Tempe, Ariz., with pressure mounting. He is one of the NFL\u2019s most improbable quarterbacks ever and perhaps the most anticipated player of the 2019 season. He also embodies a pro football experiment that is testing two extremes \u2014 one physical and the other schematic.\n\n[From Doug Flutie to Kyler Murray: Inside the NFL's newfound embrace of short quarterbacks]\n\nHe gave up millions of dollars in pro baseball money to be here. His team, the Arizona Cardinals, tore down the pillars of its organization \u2014 firing the coach, trading the quarterback \u2014 to embrace the offensive revolution sweeping the league. The Cardinals hired Coach Kliff Kingsbury, a 40-year-old offensive guru whose Air Raid scheme produced just a 35-40 record in six seasons at Texas Tech.\n\nThe NFL has long denigrated the Air Raid, a pass-heavy offense run almost exclusively out of the shotgun with four receivers and one running back. But the Cardinals believed it was feasible with the right quarterback. They had the No. 1 pick, and Murray felt like a fit, both because he ran the offense in college and because the NFL considered him risky. He was slight, outside the league\u2019s Clydesdale ideal.\n\nBut if Murray is feeling the weight of these expectations, he isn\u2019t showing it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m chilling,\u201d Murray told reporters this week. \u201cExcited for Sunday, obviously, knowing it\u2019s a big day for everybody.\u201d\n\n\n\nKyler Murray won the Heisman Trophy during his one season starting for Oklahoma. (Sue Ogrocki/AP)\n\nAfter Murray arrived at Allen, then-coach Tom Westerberg worried he wouldn\u2019t be ready because of his size and age. Murray\u2019s August birthday meant he was always one of the youngest in his grade. But he displayed polished mechanics, smarts and leadership, and after five games he became QB1.\n\nMurray told his coaches he didn\u2019t feel anxious, but during the first few plays of his first game, his body shook uncontrollably. He told reporters this week that it was the last time he felt nervous. It\u2019s unclear how Murray processes pressure, but those closest to him have always marveled at his ability to seemingly isolate himself from what\u2019s around him.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been who he is for a long time,\u201d Westerberg said.\n\nOnce settled, Murray rocketed toward stardom. He became one of the most famous Texas high school football players ever: undefeated in 42 starts, three state championships in the highest classification, highlights watched nationwide.\n\nBig college programs coveted Murray \u2014 including Clemson, Ohio State and Texas \u2014 but Murray signed with Texas A&M, his father\u2019s alma mater. That fall, Murray couldn\u2019t unseat the incumbent, sophomore Kyle Allen, and faced adversity for the first time in his career. He struggled with the diminished role and the coaches\u2019 communication style. Murray sat in his dorm room, miserable, calling his parents and loved ones.\n\nHis pro prospects at their bleakest, Murray announced his intention to transfer in December 2015. Lincoln Riley, then Oklahoma\u2019s offensive coordinator, quickly reached out. Riley had recruited Murray before, but he had been hired by the Sooners too late to become a serious contender. Now, in the afterglow of Murray\u2019s frustration with A&M, the quality Riley believes he and Murray share most \u2014 direct communication \u2014 worked in his favor. He explained his vision for Murray in a big-play offense and felt a connection.\n\n\u201cIt was one of those deals where you felt like it wasn\u2019t the first time you\u2019d talked, even though it really was,\u201d Riley said.\n\n[The Kyler Effect: Heisman winner's success inspires athletes to play two sports in college]\n\nThe revitalization of Murray\u2019s football career didn\u2019t go as planned. He sat out 2016, per transfer rules, then most of 2017 because the Big 12 Conference granted the Sooners\u2019 starter, Baker Mayfield, an unexpected extra year of eligibility. But in the meantime, Murray raked for Oklahoma\u2019s baseball team. In 51 games in 2018, the center fielder hit .296 with 10 home runs, and that summer the Oakland Athletics drafted him ninth overall. He signed with Oakland in June and agreed that, if he could quarterback that fall, he\u2019d forgo his senior season for baseball.\n\n\u201cWhen he signed the deal with the A\u2019s, I know he was fully planning on and expecting to play baseball. That wasn\u2019t some insurance policy or some front,\u201d Riley said. \u201cJust anticipating that: \u2018I\u2019m a 5-10 quarterback. I know I\u2019m good enough, I think I can be good enough, but will somebody else believe that and take that big of a chance on me?\u2019 That was always kind of a question in his mind.\u201d\n\nBefore the season, Riley thought his quarterback could lead Oklahoma into the College Football Playoff. (He did.) He thought Murray could win the Heisman Trophy. (He did.) And despite the fact that Murray clearly had a bright baseball future, Riley had a feeling that Murray would one day play football in the pros. He said he always saw \u201ca little different kind of love and passion for the game and the position\u201d in Murray.\n\nStill, Murray prepared to give up the sport. He told reporters after the Heisman ceremony, \u201cAs of right now, everybody knows I\u2019m playing [baseball].\u201d\n\nThat changed within weeks. The season Murray had \u2014 4,361 passing yards, 1,001 rushing yards, 54 combined touchdowns \u2014 sowed a seed: He might be talented enough, and the NFL might be changing enough, for him to flourish in the pros.\n\nIn early February, Murray tweeted his decision. He had never had trouble convincing himself or those around him that he could make it in football. Now, he needed to persuade the NFL itself.\n\n\n\nMurray will start the Cardinals' season opener Sunday vs. Detroit. (Dustin Bradford/Getty Images)\n\nJim Zorn, the former NFL quarterback and coach, watched his student fill the whiteboard with X\u2019s and O\u2019s. It was mid-February, days after the tweet and about two weeks before the NFL scouting combine \u2014 a critical pre-draft opportunity for Murray to convince NFL teams that a sub-6-foot quarterback was worth a first-round pick.\n\nAs part of his tutoring, Zorn quizzed Murray on all things defense, racing through familiar fronts and coverages and slowing to fill in the gaps. He pushed Murray to analyze deeper, stressing how much teams value combine interviews to form their opinions of quarterbacks. \u201cYou\u2019re always being evaluated,\u201d Zorn said he told Murray.\n\nThe more they spoke, the better Zorn understood what others have learned about Murray over the years: He\u2019s quiet. College recruiters and high school rivals found him difficult to read. One reporter in Oklahoma compared him to Russell Westbrook, the state\u2019s ornery pro basketball star. This week, Kingsbury said it has been \u201clike pulling teeth\u201d getting Murray to tell him which plays he does or doesn\u2019t like.\n\nZorn was used to chatty quarterbacks peppering him with questions and clarifications. Murray was different, wrestling with the concepts in his head.\n\n\u201cHe may be on the same page as you, but you may not know it, because he\u2019s not saying a bunch of comeback words,\u201d Zorn said. \u201cHe just thinks.\u201d\n\n[Aaron Rodgers can do it all. If the Packers got their offseason right, he might not have to.]\n\nWhile a new face schooled Murray\u2019s mind, an old one trained his body.\n\nStephen Baca met Murray seven years earlier, when the trainer visited Allen with Performance Course, a private strength and conditioning program popular with Texas high schools. Baca said Murray \u201cbarely spoke\u201d at first, but in time they began talking every game day. Later, in the first few weeks of his freshman season at A&M, Murray called Baca, which was unusual.\n\nMurray vented, and Baca listened. They talked more and bonded over their shared love of movies. Now they train together every summer, consider each other brothers and FaceTime regularly, sometimes without anything to say.\n\nBaca understood Murray would face herculean defenders and durability questions in the NFL. He wanted to \u201cbulletproof\u201d the quarterback from injury, starting with a warmup that puts extreme rotations on Murray\u2019s joints, from his ankles to his shoulders. The stretches simulate a defender\u2019s crunching hit in hopes that, if his ankle or knee grows more accustomed to the twist, the body will tell the brain this range of motion is okay and not \u201cbad, bad, bad,\u201d Baca said, which increases the likelihood of a tear.\n\nBaca focused on \u201cunilateral\u201d workouts, with one leg or arm, because he believes it better represents game situations. A player\u2019s feet or arms are rarely, if ever, even. Greater time under tension strengthens muscle fiber, so Baca told Murray to worry less about the force he can create and more about what he could absorb.\n\n\u201cEverything we do is for one goal,\u201d Baca said, \u201cwhich is keeping him on the field.\u201d\n\n\n\nMurray walks the red carpet ahead of the first round of the NFL draft in April. (Steve Helber/AP)\n\nFor all the work Murray invested to become an NFL quarterback, the final step included a stroke of good timing. The Cardinals owned the league\u2019s worst record and its top draft choice, and they had just hired Kingsbury as head coach. Years earlier, Kingsbury had scouted Allen and watched, amazed, as the skinny sophomore quarterback dominated. He offered a scholarship thinking that one day the kid could lead his offense.\n\nWhile Murray was winning the Heisman at Oklahoma, his predecessor, Mayfield, helped transform the Cleveland Browns as their No. 1 pick. Patrick Mahomes, a former quarterback of Kingsbury\u2019s at Texas Tech, lit up the league with the Kansas City Chiefs and was named MVP. The NFL seemed ready to take a chance on a gifted but undersized quarterback with a background in the Air Raid.\n\nAfter all, Murray wasn\u2019t that much smaller than Mayfield or 5-11 Seattle Seahawks star Russell Wilson. In Murray, said ESPN analyst and former NFL quarterback Matt Hasselbeck, Arizona saw a chance to get a playmaker like Wilson.\n\n\u201cNot only is [Murray] incredibly marketable and a great leader, he\u2019s also in some ways, even when you call the perfect defense, undefendable,\u201d Hasselbeck said.\n\nIn late April, Murray strode under bright lights in Nashville as the No. 1 pick in a pink pinstripe suit inspired by his favorite movie, \u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d He had devoted his life to pursuing athletic greatness, yet until months earlier this version of it seemed impossible.\n\nIn the months since, skeptics still found fodder. After he finished 3 for 8 for 12 yards in a preseason game against the Oakland Raiders, safety Lamarcus Joyner called the Cardinals\u2019 offense \u201cpretty boy football.\u201d ESPN analyst and former NFL coach Rex Ryan predicted the Cardinals were \u201cgoing to get whipped Week 1.\u201d None of this fazed Kingsbury or Murray, who will have their first opportunity to stifle doubters Sunday at home against the Detroit Lions.\n\n\u201cNobody knows what we\u2019re going to do or what it\u2019s going to look like,\u201d Kingsbury told reporters this week, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to find out.\u201d\n\nA few weeks after the draft, Pierce, the former Allen team parent, walked into one of Murray\u2019s summer workouts with Baca. Pierce had been in Allen that day seven years ago when Murray couldn\u2019t lift the barbell. He looked at the man who had taken the kid\u2019s place. He asked if Murray remembered that day, too.\n\nMurray grinned. He remembered. Pierce watched as Murray got back to work and, while it wasn\u2019t clear whether the quarterback realized it, he was preparing to absorb a weight heavier than any barbell could hold.\n\nMore NFL coverage:\n\nDaniel Snyder dreamed of owning the Redskins.
