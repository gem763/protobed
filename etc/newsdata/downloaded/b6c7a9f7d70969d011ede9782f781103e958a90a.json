It would only take a bus driver, confused about the exemptions, chucking off a diabetic who was opening up a pack of Haribos to deal with low blood sugar \u2013 a hypo for those of us in the trade \u2013 for all hell to break loose.\n\nBy touting such an idea, along with the similarly illiberal call for a calorie cap on what food outlets serve up, she has provided a truck load of ammunition to those on the right who don\u2019t want to see anything done to address the issue.\n\n\u201cHer policy ideas have become synonymous with the silliest extremes of the nanny state,\u201d fulminated Christopher Snowdon, head of lifestyle economics at the Institute of Economic Affairs. \u201cThe suggestion that it be a crime to eat a sandwich on a train brings Dame Sally\u2019s tenure as chief medical officer to a fittingly authoritarian conclusion.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a line that might resonate even with some moderates more usually sympathetic to public health messaging.\n\nI suppose Dame Sally could argue that she has at least succeeded in getting the issue onto a news agenda dominated by Brexit and Donald Trump. It\u2019s being talked about.\n\nShe could also argue that while people might not accept the ban she proposes, or even the calorie cap, she\u2019s maybe opened the door for some of her more practical, but still potentially controversial, ideas.\n\nThese include banning ads for unhealthy foods at major public venues, which could also be painted as authoritarian until you realise that we did it successfully with cigarettes to the public\u2019s great benefit. There\u2019s also a call to ensure healthy meals are provided in schools at a low price. Great idea. Let\u2019s do it.\n\nDame Sally also has proposals for ways unhealthy food could be taxed more. This too has potential. The existing \u201csugar tax\u201d has led to a sharp decline in the sugar content of soft drinks, for example.\n\nThe problem is that the food on public transport idea is so out there it could strike at the credibility of the exercise. She may have served to make it harder for someone like health secretary Matt Hancock, no one\u2019s idea of a cabinet bruiser, to push her more moderate proposals, given the nature of the current administration.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not the only problem with what Dame Sally has done here.\n\nShe was also the subject of media reports today for warning of the potential for deaths resulting from a no-deal Brexit. The government\u2019s own assessment says this could lead to medicine shortages so her point was well made.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t put it past the vandals pushing for that outcome to respond by painting her as the person who wants to ban snacks on Tube trains, and to use that to undermine her hugely important point.\n\nConflating the two is a cheap and cynical tactic. But it\u2019s not beneath some people. And it\u2019s worked in the past.", "description": "The lack of political nous demonstrated by some eminent and highly intelligent public figures never ceases to amaze.\u00a0 Take Dame Sally Davies, the government\u2019s outgoing chief medical officer.", "authors": ["James Moore"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/10/13/istock-1152653394-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
