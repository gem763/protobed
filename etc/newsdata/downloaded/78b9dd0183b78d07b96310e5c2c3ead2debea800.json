It's not important when your boyfriend has cancer.\"\n\nTeaching assistant Jez was diagnosed a synovial sarcoma back in 2016, which was attached to his hand, whilst he was in his second year of university.\n\n(Image: Jessi Harris)\n\n(Image: Jessi Harris)\n\nAfter undergoing five weeks of daily radiotherapy, he had an operation to remove it, and was given the all-clear.\n\nBut Jez, who lives with Jessi in Bromyard, Herts, received the awful news when he went in for a routine scan in September and doctors found a dark shadow on his lung.\n\nFurther tests revealed that the cancer had spread to his lung, spine, sternum and shoulder.\n\nJessi said: \"We have had two years of getting our lives back on track after it being put on hold whilst Jez got better.\n\n\"We are beyond devastated. We have come full circle right back to where we were 3 years ago.\n\n\"Our future has been taken from us yet again and we are left unsure and uncertain of anything.\n\n(Image: Jessi Harris)\n\n\"Our life had been put on pause for so young and with us both being so young, we were just starting out and getting to do what normal couples do.\n\n\"Then to have it all ripped away from you. It's bad enough having that happen once, so to happen twice is just a double blow really.\"\n\nNow the couple will get married on Valentine's Day next year in front of family and friends.\n\nJessi said: \"The decision to bring the big day forward was an easy one to make.\n\n\"You do realise that anything can happen and it's not in your control.\n\n\"You just have to adapt and it was hard to think about but it makes sense.\n\n\"The day we found out I just turned to Jez and just said 'I just wish we could get married right now.\n\n\"If we could have done it then, we would have.\n\n(Image: Jessi Harris)\n\n(Image: Jessi Harris)\n\n\"Because it's a special situation, it's affected all our friends and family.\n\n\"We want it to be a big celebration together.\"\n\nDoctors have told the pair that the cancer is incurable meaning any treatment will simply control and maintain it as it is likely to carry on spreading.\n\nNow the couple are raising money on GoFundMe to try and treat the cancer privately.\n\nAnd they are hoping that an private DNA test through firm Oncologica could identify a treatment suitable for Jez.\n\nJessi said: \"They have said that Jez's cancer is incurable, so if they were to start chemo and radiotherapy too soon, it would exhaust them as options.\n\n\"But I think we need to consider other treatments, why wait until he's ill or the tumours get bigger.\n\n\"And that's we set up the GoFundMe as it feels like otherwise we're sitting back and doing nothing.\n\n\"I can't sit back there and do nothing, especially when you hear the word incurable, it's just a kick to the stomach it really is.\n\n\"You just don't expect to hear those words when your boyfriend is 25, you just don't.\n\n\"You just think 'oh they've put a time limit on Jez's life and I want to do anything within my power.\n\n\"There are treatments out there that could help and we'd rather do something than nothing.\"\n\nYou can donate to Jez's GoFundMe here .", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Bride-to-be Jessi Harris is determined to wed her fiance Jez Roberts as soon as possible after doctors told him that his cancer is incurable", "authors": ["Rosaleen Fenton", "Image", "Jessi Harris"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20679277.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_A-BRAVE-couple-has-had-to-speed-up-their-wedding-plans-after-the-groom-to-be-was-diagnosed-with-term.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
