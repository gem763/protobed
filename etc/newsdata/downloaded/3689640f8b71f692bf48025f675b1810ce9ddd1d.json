The number of such prisoners had reduced but some were held without evidence of the exceptional circumstances required to justify their location.\"\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror-Andy Stenning)\n\nChild killer murdered\n\nHuckle's death was not the first at Full Sutton. In 2011, child killer Colin Hatch was murdered.\n\nHatch was jailed for life in 1994 for killing seven-year-old Sean Williams in a north London tower block.\n\nHe murdered Sean while on parole from a three-year sentence for a choking assault and had a history of abusing young boys.\n\nHatch's killer was Damien Fowkes, a serial armed robber, he was given a life sentence for the murder.\n\nHe had previously attacked Ian Huntley at Durham's Frankland in 2010. Huntley, who was serving a life term for the murders of 10-year-old Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in 2002, had his throat slashed by Fowkes.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror-Andy Stenning)\n\nDr Death\n\nSidney Noble, dubbed 'Dr Death' after being convicted of poisoning more than 50 elderly people in order to steal from them, died after a brutal attack in his cell.\n\nInmate Ian Magowan strangled and jumped on the chest of the 77-year-old in 2005 after tying him up and gagging him.\n\nNoble died two weeks after the attack from brain damage and Magowan was jailed for life, serving a minimum of 16 years in 2006 for the killing.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror-Andy Stenning)\n\nFight clubs\n\nFull Sutton has a history of violent outbursts.\n\nNotoriously, back in 2005 the chief inspector of prisons, Anne Owens, revealed that gangs inside the jail were operating 'fight clubs' to pay off debts.\n\nShe said that the levels of violence and bullying coupled with the lack of CCTV left many wings of the prison unsafe.\n\nMs Owens told the Guardian in 2005: \"Security searches of prisoners' cells revealed evidence that 'fight clubs' were being organised, usually to pay off debts.\n\n\"Some prisoners were being pressurised by other prisoners into fights to clear their debts. Presumably betting goes on as well.\"\n\nHowever, the most recent CQC report (2016) said that \"violence remained rare and incidents were generally low level.\"\n\nNotorious inmates\n\nCurtis Warren\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo)\n\nDrug-dealer Warren amassed such a fortune from his illegal activities that he once appeared on The Sunday Times Rich List. He was jailed for 13 years in 2009 for plotting to smuggle \u00a31m of cannabis into Jersey.\n\nWarren was later handed another ten-year sentence for failing to pay back \u00a3198m he was suspected of making through crime. Once Interpol's most wanted, Warren, now 53, has served part of his sentence at Full Sutton.\n\nCharles Bronson\n\n(Image: Sunday Mirror)\n\nDubbed Britain's toughest prisoner, Bronson, 66, is one of the most notorious inmates in the country. Although his crimes on the outside world were not as grave as others on this list, it is his behaviour inside prison that has made Bronson a household name.\n\nDuring a stint in Hull Prison in the 1970s he held an art teacher hostage for 44 hours.\n\nBronson, who grew up in Ellesmere Port, later spent time in Full Sutton prison, where he reportedly covered himself in butter and attacked prison officers after Arsenal beat Hull City in the 2014 FA Cup final, angering Bronson, a Tottenham fan.\n\nDale Cregan\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nManchester gangster Dale Cregan is serving a whole-life term of imprisonment for the brutal murder of two female police officers in 2012.

Lin, Megan and the dog died while Josie suffered horrific head injuries, although went on to make a good recovery.\n\nStone was arrested a year after the murders and was convicted and jailed for life.

Stone, now 56, served part of his sentence in Full Sutton.\n\nColin Ireland\n\n(Image: Unknown)\n\nIreland, who became known as the Gay Slayer, tortured five homosexual men to death in 1993.

Ireland served part of his sentence in Full Sutton prison before he died in jail in Wakefield in 2012, aged 57.\n\nDennis Nilsen\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nKnown as the Muswell Hill Murderer, Nilsen was one of the most shocking serial killers in British history. He murdered and dismembered at least 12 men during a killing spree between 1978 and 1983 in London.\n\nHis victims were all strangled or drowned. Nilsen would then take part in a disturbing ritual in which he bathed and dressed the bodies before dissecting and disposing of the remains by flushing them down the toilet or burning them on a bonfire.\n\nHe was caught after neighbours complained about the drains being blocked. Inside, human flesh and bones were discovered. He later admitted having sex with some of his victims after they had died.\n\nNilsen was convicted of six counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder in 1983 and jailed for life with a minimum of 25 years. He died in Full Sutton prison in May 2018.\n\nJeremy Bamber\n\nBamber was convicted of murdering his adoptive parents, adoptive sister and her six-year-old twin nephews in 1986. The family were shot dead in Essex in August 1985 in what became known as the White House Farm murders.\n\nBamber, who maintains his innocence, is serving a whole-life term which means he will never be released from prison.
