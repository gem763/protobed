This whopping amount is actually more than the Rs 63,538 crore health allocation in the budget for 2019-2020.\n\nDepositors of crisis hit Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank display placards and photographs of depositors whom they say have lost lives following the crisis during a protest over the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) curbs on the bank, outside a court in Mumbai.

While the budget for health has been abysmally low as public sector hospitals on which most rural households depend get their funds from the government whereas the government is losing more and more money in the form of bank frauds.\n\nThe health allocation for 2018-19 was Rs 54,667 crore while it was at Rs 48,878 crore the year before it. Even as there has been no significant increase in the allocation for the health sector, there is a rising tide of financial and banking scams that has had its toll on India\u2019s economy.\n\nOverall, at least 3,766 incidents of frauds were detected this year, which is a 15 per cent increase from last year.\n\nAs we know, a happy country is a healthy country but to achieve that we need to overcome the grim picture that has been pointed out by the global hunger index. At the same time, we should be aware that the vast majority of the Indian population are still poor and cannot even afford daily meals.\n\nBCCL/ FILE\n\nThe infants not only require special care but also proper nourishment. In many rural households these are more than a distant dream, which is why UN bodies such as the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) is running campaigns in several parts of the country to provide healthy food to mothers and their newborn.\n\nSeveral state governments are also running these programmes and have been helpful to many families. However, budgetary allocations and insufficient funds prevent them from achieving their full potential.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi-led NDA government had promised to put the priorities of the Indian people above all and had sought to punish financial scamsters. Of course, in several cases such as the ongoing PMC Bank turmoil in Mumbai, the depositors who are unable to withdraw their hard-earned money from the bank require immediate help and support but in the long run, what better way to recover these huge amounts of money and utilise them to feed our infants.\n\nTime to think, perhaps!", "description": "These were shocking statistics put out by Global Hunger Index last week that painted a complete opposite picture of a \u2018New India\u2019 in the making but the situation could very well be reversed if all the money that has been plundered over the last couple of months in the form of financial scams could be recovered and used in the direction.", "authors": ["Saket Suman"], "top_image": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2019/Oct/scams_in_india_1571553719_800x420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
