Photo: Craig Barritt/Getty Images for TIME\n\nOne of President Trump\u2019s most absurd personnel moves was appointing his real-estate lawyer Jason Greenblatt as special envoy to the Middle East. Greenblatt had no serious foreign policy experience, a fairly serious drawback when the task involves resolving one of the most famously intractable foreign policy challenges in the world.\n\nGreenblatt has reportedly drawn up his plan. But before it\u2019s unveiled, he is leaving the White House, a sequence of timing that should probably not increase one\u2019s confidence in the plan\u2019s prospects of success. Axios reports most of Greenblatt\u2019s responsibilities will be transferred to Avi Berkowitz. Who is Avi Berkowitz? He\u2019s a 29-year-old Jared Kushner friend who graduated from law school in 2016:\n\nFrom there he joined the Trump campaign as \u201cassistant director of data analytics,\u201d where he was tasked with producing the campaign\u2019s \u201cpre- and post-presidential-debate talk show that became a nightly Facebook Live discussion in the weeks leading up to the election,\u201d according to a 2017 Business Insider profile. The story describes Berkowitz as \u201cKushner\u2019s 28-year-old prot\u00e9g\u00e9,\u201d which is one of the funnier thumbnail r\u00e9sum\u00e9 descriptions you\u2019ll ever see. He is the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to a young political dilettante who married into the family of a reality-television star who was elected president despite knowing almost nothing about public policy.\n\nFrom there, Berkowitz settled in under Kushner:\n\nHis role was \u201cprimarily administrative and involves assisting Kushner in daily logistics.\u201d And now he is reportedly in charge of diplomacy between Israel and the Palestinians! Former Middle East envoy Martin Indyk is aghast:\n\nIf Avi Berkowitz is \u2066@jdgreenblatt45\u2069 \u2018s replacement it\u2019s a considerable downgrade in the position. He\u2019s Kushner\u2019s 29-year-old assistant. Nice guy but does not have the weight or experience of Trump\u2019s former real estate lawyer. https://t.co/LYMcNzuncd \u2014 Martin Indyk (@Martin_Indyk) September 5, 2019\n\nObviously, Trump believes being Jewish is not only a necessary qualification to serve as his Middle East adviser, but also a sufficient one.
