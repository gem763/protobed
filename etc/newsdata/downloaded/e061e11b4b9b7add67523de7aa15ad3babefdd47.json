Protesters held signs, sang and chanted \u201cthe oceans are rising, no more compromising\u201d as trams were brought to a halt by their occupancy.\n\nThe entire CBD was disrupted by the protest that organisers were calling \u201ca flashmob with a cause\u201d, Herald Sun reports.\n\n\u201cWe know that the bosses, the rich and the government don\u2019t give a shit about us or our future,\u201d Activist Siobhan McGlynn said.\n\nAlthough protests are really annoying, especially when you\u2019re on your way home in peak hour traffic, but the activists raise a pretty valid point. It\u2019s pretty obvious that we\u2019re not doing enough when it comes to environmental issues.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a fan of the protests, or you were disrupted by them, I think we can all agree that it\u2019s time the government, and society as a whole, starts to prioritise the planet a little bit.\n\n\u201cWe know that all they care about is profit, and not the lives of the people that are living on this planet or the future generations to come,\u201d Ms McGlynn continued. \u201cWe have to stand up, make a fuss, annoy the hell out of them until they change \u2013 until action is made.\u201d\n\nThe protest only lasted at that intersection for about half an hour before relocating to Flinders and Elizabeth Street intersection, one of the other major traffic spots during Friday afternoon peak hour.\n\nAll traffic from cars, buses and trams was halted at 6.30pm on Friday night, but reportedly cleared by about 7pm, with trams running behind schedule following the delay.\n\nOther areas targeted included Melbourne Central Shopping Centre, which was swarmed prior to the rally. Protesters were seen hanging flags and signs over the famous gold clock, while a woman with a megaphone shouted chants from one of the upper levels of the popular shopping centre and train station.\n\n\u201cWe are Extinction Rebellion,\u201d the unnamed woman chanted. \u201cWe are the first and only people taking time out of lives to disrupt business as usual because business as usual is the destruction of our planet.\u201d\n\nPolice presence in the area was higher than usual, with mounted officers and public order response officers surrounding the protests. Authorities expected and braced for up to 10,000 protesters, but only about 300 people actually gathered for the event.\n\nThe protest organisers provided little information to PTV and authorities, so it was difficult for Yarra Trams and other transport services to alert the public of potential delays.\n\nIt looks like only one arrest has been made in relation to the protests, but Victoria Police were unable to confirm this when questioned by 9News. However, a Victoria Police spokesperson released the following statement regarding the protests:\n\n\u201cPolice make every effort to engage with event organisers to facilitate their right to lawful protest whilst discussing expectations around appropriate behaviour. As always, anyone coming to an event in Melbourne looking to disrupt others or create conflict and incite violence can expect a firm response from police.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to get a message across, this is sure as hell a way to do it. Whether you agree with it or not, they definitely brought attention to the issue.", "description": "", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/20190906001417034310-original-1024x683.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
