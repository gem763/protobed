Ford is going to reveal its all-electric Mustang-inspired crossover next month. The name of the electric crossover hasn\u2019t been officially announced yet, though Mach E has been cited frequently.\n\nFord announced that the electric crossover will make its debut on November 17, a day before we walk in to the Los Angeles auto show. The announcement comes with a side-profile silhouette of the crossover. We don't have any other details yet, other than that Ford claims a range of 300 miles.\n\nPhoto credit: Ford More\n\nThe silhouette is our best look at the crossover so far. The headlights take direct styling cues from the 2020 Mustang, and the tri-bar taillights aren't left behind. The roofline looks similar to that of the Mustang we know and love, and it concludes with a sharp roof spoiler.\n\nIt's crucial that this electric crossover be a hit for Ford's sake, which explains why the automaker chose to use the Mustang's heritage to help promote it. Now that Ford's fuel-efficient passenger cars are no longer, the company needs to prove it's still environmentally friendly. Ford announced the launch of the largest EV charging network in the U.S. this month, which was probably a move made to prepare for the arrival of their electric crossover.\n\nThis new model will aim at currently available EVs such as the Chevrolet Bolt EV, Hyundai Kona Electric, and Kia Niro EV, along with the upcoming Tesla Model Y crossover scheduled to go on sale next year. We can expect Ford\u2019s electric crossover start somewhere around $40,000 when it arrives in 2020.\n\nWe'll have all the details of Ford's upcoming all-electric crossover when it debuts on November 17.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Most likely called the Mach E, the electric crossover will have 300 miles of driving range.", "authors": ["Connor Hoffman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/opqJaxIep2nKQflYYOVicQ--~B/aD03MjI7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/car_and_driver_581/dc297a81b405ba6e2ea496e2e427ce61", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
