It\u2019s the first game,\u2019 LeBron told reporters in the locker room after the game, having been just one rebound and two assists away from a triple-double.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Obviously the NBA is back, and everyone is trying to have the narrative of a rivalry game and it was a huge test. I think both teams are not where they want to be.\n\n\u2018We have a lot of room to improve, we\u2019re a new group that\u2019s coming together, we have a new coaching staff, we have a new system. It\u2019s not a rivalry. We\u2019re trying to get better every single day on how we can be as great as we can be.\n\n\u2018We did some good things tonight, we did some not so good things and that happens in game one, especially in a new club. So we look forward to getting in the film room tomorrow and seeing some of the mistakes we made that we could have been better at.\u2019\n\nOn any perceived defensive issues against the Clippers, he added bluntly: \u2018I don\u2019t think they\u2019re issues. You don\u2019t have issues after one game.\u2019\n\nLeBron and Anthony Davis did not enjoy the opening night they were hoping for (Picture: Getty)\n\nJames suffered a groin injury against the Golden State Warriors back in December and says he is only now back at 100% fitness, and was delighted to be back on court despite the defeat.\n\nOn how it feels to be back, he continued: \u2018Ecstatic. I was so excited to get back on the floor. Obviously a little rusty as far as my perimeter shooting and just not being in a game situation in a while.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I haven\u2019t played that many minutes in quite a while. Just to be able to go out there and fly around once again and jump high and be at 100%, it\u2019s something I worked my tail off after the groin injury in December, just trying to get back to who I am, so it was great to get back out there.\u2019", "description": "LeBron James has played down the significance of the Lakers\u2019 opening night defeat to Los Angeles rivals the Clippers and says he was thrilled to be back on the court...", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1177700543_1571813112.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
