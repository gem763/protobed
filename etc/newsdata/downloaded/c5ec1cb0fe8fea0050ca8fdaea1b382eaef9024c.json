Week 1 of the 2019 NFL season is here and college football is already through the first two weeks of the schedule.\n\nAnd there are, unfortunately, some college football teams whose seasons may be over not long before they began. While Week 2 will be more known for the overtime escapes of No. 7 Michigan and Florida State, it also dropped some well-known programs to 0-2 and might have jeopardized their season\u2019s fortunes already.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at those winless teams.\n\nTennessee Volunteers\n\nHoly moly, Tennessee. What in the world is happening in Knoxville? The Vols were ahead for nearly the entire game against BYU until an incredible coverage bust in the final seconds of the fourth quarter led to a game-tying field goal for BYU.\n\nFrom there, things got worse. The two teams traded TDs in the first overtime and Tennessee started the second OT with a field goal. BYU responded with a game-winning touchdown and a 29-26 win.\n\nGiven the dysfunction that was the Tennessee coaching search after the 2017 season it\u2019s not crazy to wonder what losses to Georgia State and BYU do for Jeremy Pruitt\u2019s standing as coach. And it\u2019s also not crazy to wonder how in the world Tennessee makes a bowl game this season.\n\nThe Vols have games against No. 2 Alabama, No. 3 Georgia and No. 11 Florida still on the schedule. If all three of those are losses, then Tennessee has to go 6-1 over the remaining seven games for a bowl game. Do you think that\u2019s happening after seeing Tennessee over the first two weeks of the season? We certainly don\u2019t.\n\nTennessee didn't trail against BYU until Ty'Son Williams' game-winning touchdown in overtime.

We\u2019re already regretting having Miami at No. 15 in our Yahoo Sports preseason top 25.\n\nStory continues\n\nMiami fell to 0-2 Saturday night after losing 28-25 at North Carolina. Yeah, Florida \u2014 the team that beat Miami in Week 0 \u2014 is a borderline top-10 team and the Tar Heels are now 2-0 after beating South Carolina in Week 1. But losing to North Carolina when you have 14 days to prepare is almost inexcusable when you\u2019re Miami.\n\nTrue freshman QB Sam Howell was 16-of-24 passing for 274 yards and two scores against Miami\u2019s defense while running back Javonte Williams averaged 7.6 yards a carry.\n\nThings shouldn\u2019t be nearly as bleak for the Hurricanes as they are for the Volunteers, however. QB Jarren Williams showed promise against the Gators and was 30-of-39 passing for 309 yards and two scores Saturday night. And the ACC is much more manageable than the SEC. Miami still has a legitimate shot at eight wins in 2019. But maybe we\u2019re just saying that to try to not be really wrong about our preseason ranking.\n\nUCLA Bruins\n\nChip Kelly\u2019s rebuild in Los Angeles is going to take some time. A week after losing at Cincinnati in Week 1, the Bruins lost 23-14 at home to San Diego State. The Aztecs beat FCS Weber State 6-0 in Week 1.\n\nTo make things worse it was the first time San Diego State had ever beaten UCLA. The teams had met 22 times before Saturday and UCLA had won every single one.\n\nSan Diego State used its typical ball-control offense to keep UCLA off the field and the Bruins turned the ball over twice while San Diego State didn\u2019t turn it over at all.\n\nWhile UCLA\u2019s roster is young \u2014 over 60 players are listed as freshmen or redshirt freshmen \u2014 the Bruins need to be beating teams like San Diego State at home. And if UCLA can\u2019t do that, then who can it beat? Certainly not Oklahoma. The Sooners travel to UCLA in Week 3 and then the Bruins play at Washington State and at Arizona. An 0-5 start looks very possible.\n\nSouth Florida Bulls\n\nCharlie Strong\u2019s got to be feeling the heat in Tampa. After his team was obliterated 49-0 in Week 1 by No. 17 Wisconsin, the Bulls lost 14-10 at Georgia Tech on Saturday.\n\nLosses to Power Five teams aren\u2019t bad by themselves. But the Georgia Tech loss is the program\u2019s eighth straight dating back to 2018 \u2014 a season where USF started 7-0 and finished 7-6. And an offense that returned nine starters from 2018 has scored just 10 points in two games.\n\nQB Blake Barnett was benched in favor of backup Jordan McCloud in the second half and the offense scored its first touchdown of the season with McCloud at the helm. But USF LB Patrick Macon was called for targeting after the Bulls appeared to force a Georgia Tech punt with two minutes to go and the Yellow Jackets were able to run the clock out.\n\nStrong is in his third season at USF and went 10-2 in 2017. But things have gotten worse from there. A game against FCS South Carolina State next week should be a chance to for the offense to get on track \u2014 either with McCloud or Barnett at QB \u2014 and games against SMU and UConn after that are winnable. But USF is going to have to play considerably better.\n\nHere are the rest of Week 2\u2019s winners and losers.\n\nWinners\n\nArkansas State and Blake Anderson: The head coach surprised his team ahead of Saturday night\u2019s game. Anderson has been on a leave of absence because of the death of his wife Wendy from cancer and missed the team\u2019s first game of the season. What a cool moment to see the team welcome him back.\n\nWelcome back, coach!\n\n\n\nArkansas State Head Coach Blake Anderson has been away from his team following the death of his wife Wendy, today he surprised them \u2764\ufe0f\n\n\n\n(via @AStateFB)pic.twitter.com/O2NQ85oj8c \u2014 Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) September 8, 2019\n\nSMU: The Mustangs avenged a 2018 loss to North Texas with a 49-27 win over the Mean Green on Saturday night. SMU scored 21 unanswered first half points to put UNT away early. Texas transfer Shane Buechele was 21-of-31 passing for 292 yards and three interceptions while running back Xavier Jones had 16 carries for 127 yards and three scores.\n\nOh, the helmets were awesome too.\n\nSMU's helmets \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/tNPKF0Tc1a \u2014 Yahoo Sports College Football (@YahooSportsCFB) September 7, 2019\n\nWisconsin: No one has scored against Wisconsin this season. After beating South Florida 49-0 in Week 1, the No. 17 Badgers followed that game up with a 61-0 win at home over Central Michigan. That\u2019s 110-0 if you don\u2019t want to do the quick math.\n\nRB Jonathan Taylor had a pedestrian day by his lofty standards with 19 carries for 102 yards and three scores. But he added another receiving TD after scoring the first of his career against the Bulls.\n\nSouth Carolina quarterback Ryan Hilinski threw two TDs in his first start. (AP Photo/John Amis)\n\nSouth Carolina QB Ryan Hilinski: The freshman made his first start in place of the injured Jake Bentley and it went really well. Hilinski, the brother of the late Washington State QB Tyler Hilinski, was 24-of-30 passing for 282 yards and two touchdowns and an interception in South Carolina\u2019s 72-10 rout of FCS Charleston Southern.\n\nIowa State: GameDay is heading to Ames for the first time. ESPN announced Saturday that the pregame show was heading to Iowa State for the Iowa game in Week 3. It\u2019s a nice reward for an Iowa State team that was off in Week 2 after sneaking out a win in Week 1 against FCS Northern Iowa.\n\nRice QB Wiley Green: We\u2019re thankful that Green\u2019s injury Friday night wasn\u2019t more serious. Green was released from the hospital on Friday night after he was carted off the field on a backboard following a vicious hit against Wake Forest. Green was on the ground for nearly 10 minutes following a hit to the head while he was trying to score a touchdown. Rice said in a statement Saturday morning that \u201call post-injury testing came back negative\u201d and that Green would be continue to be treated symptomatically by the school\u2019s medical staff.\n\nLosers\n\nKansas: Oh no, Jayhawks. A week after Kansas celebrated a win over FCS Indiana State like crazy in Les Miles\u2019 debut, things came crashing back to Earth in Week 2 with a 12-7 loss to Coastal Carolina. Yes, Coastal Carolina, a team that spent part of the week practicing at Clemson because it was evacuated for Hurricane Dorian. Wasn\u2019t Miles\u2019 arrival in Lawrence supposed to get rid of the status quo?\n\nLes Miles: \u201cThis is a game we should\u2019ve won. It\u2019s just that simple.\u201d #kufball \u2014 Matt Galloway (@themattgalloway) September 8, 2019\n\nFAU: Things aren\u2019t going so great in Boca Raton. Losses to Ohio State and UCF are understandable. But they\u2019ve both been blowouts. After losing 45-21 to the Buckeyes in Week 1, FAU lost 48-14 on Saturday to UCF. And this happened when FAU tried to pooch punt in the first half.\n\nLet\u2019s check in on Lane Kiffin pic.twitter.com/zXCreDEGtk \u2014 Yahoo Sports College Football (@YahooSportsCFB) September 7, 2019\n\nRutgers: The offensive explosion that Rutgers had in its Week 1 win over UMass did not carry over at all to Week 2. Heck, the Scarlet Knights couldn\u2019t even score against Iowa. The Hawkeyes beat Rutgers 30-0 and the box score may be even uglier than that. Rutgers QBs McLane Carter and Artur Sitkowski threw for a combined 41 yards and two interceptions while the team rushed for 84 yards. Brutal.\n\nNebraska: It\u2019s not going to be an instant turnaround for Scott Frost at Nebraska. But man, blowing a 17-0 halftime lead is brutal. The Huskers got outscored 34-14 after the half in a 34-31 overtime loss at Colorado.\n\nThe Big Ten West is looking tougher than we thought before the season too. Wisconsin looks fantastic so far and Iowa hasn\u2019t been a slouch. Nebraska can still contend for the division title, but maybe the 2019 expectations need to be tweaked a bit.\n\nWest Virginia: The rebuilding job that Neal Brown has on his hands in Morgantown looks quite large. The Mountaineers were thoroughly outplayed in every facet in a 38-7 loss at Missouri. Oklahoma transfer QB Austin Kendall threw two picks and Jack Allison threw another while Missouri \u2014 a team that lost to Wyoming in Week 1 \u2014 rolled up 232 yards rushing.\n\nVanderbilt: A bowl is already looking like a distant possibility for the Commodores. After being uncompetitive in a Week 1 loss at home to Georgia, Vanderbilt went on the road to Purdue and lost 42-24 as Purdue star WR Rondale Moore had 13 catches for 220 yards.\n\nVanderbilt\u2019s next opponent? No. 6 LSU. An 0-3 start is staring the Commodores in the face. The good news \u2014 if there is any \u2014 is that the schedule includes just one ranked team over the final nine games.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nNick Bromberg is a writer for Yahoo Sports.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "UCLA also fell to 0-2 after losing to a San Diego State team that beat Weber State 6-0 in Week 1.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/eR1K6BiVI6KHAdqMoUSP_A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTIuMjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/X4geIPAj2SS8wtG4t1uU6g--~B/aD0xOTk3O3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/3ba2a110-d1f4-11e9-bbef-4afb65d6c36d", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
