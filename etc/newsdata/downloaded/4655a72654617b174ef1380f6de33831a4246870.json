While the companies define themselves as \u201caffiliates,\u201d they operate autonomously.\n\nDespite the simplicity of this business model, the financial metrics reported by the company are vastly different from those of a typical Canadian licensed producer or U.S. multistate operator.\n\nTo help better understand how Canopy Rivers accounts for its investments, the company has created a helpful infographic that provides clarity in how it classifies its investments and how they translate in the company\u2019s financials. See it below.\n\n\u201cWhen you layer these 29 different financial instruments on top of 17 investees, the result is a somewhat complex set of financial statements,\u201d said Canopy Rivers CFO Eddie Lucarelli.\n\n\u201cWe strive to reduce that complexity by ensuring a robust level of disclosure in our financial statements and MD&A. Despite the challenges associated with this complexity, we believe that our ability to create multifaceted investment structures differentiates us in the venture capital arena and supports our position as a preferred supplier of capital to the cannabis industry.\"\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
