He also was on the board of a Chinese-backed private equity company. He flew to China with his father aboard Air Force Two in 2013.\n\nHe announced over the weekend he was stepping down from the board position at BHR (Shanghai) Equity Investment Fund Management Company, where he insists he was unpaid while his father was in office.\n\nOver the weekend, Hunter announced he would be stepping down from his position on the board of a Chinese-backed private equity company at the end of this month.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced at the end of September the Democratic-controlled House was opening an impeachment inquiry into the president following revelations he urged his Ukrainian counterpart to dig up dirt on political rival Joe Biden\n\nHunter has denied playing a role in forming the Chinese company or having equity in it while his father was in office and insists the board position was unpaid.\n\nAlthough Biden and his son are facing scrutiny for potential corruption and conflicts of interest, more attention has been focused on the president asking foreign governments to assist in digging up dirt on one of the most likely 2020 Democratic opponents.\n\nTrump has insisted he does not thing he will face Biden in the 2020 general elections and asserts his call with Zelensky was 'perfect.' He also said, as an excuse for asking Ukraine and China for help investigating, that he has a responsibility to stop corruption.\n\nThere has not been a lot of national polling on opinions for the president's imprisonment, but some Democratic lawmakers insist impeachment is not enough and the president should face jail time for his actions.\n\nThe margins of error for this question is plus or minus 3.6 per cent in Iowa, plus or minus 3.7 per cent in New Hampshire and plus or minus 3.7 per cent in South Carolina.\n\nSupport for impeachment has continued to climb ever since Pelosi announced the inquiry.\n\nDemocrats claim there was a quid pro quo set during the president's conversation with Zelensky. The administration froze military aid to Ukraine a few days before their July 25 phone call, and Democrats insists he was holding the millions in aide in exchange for the Ukrainian's help in probing Biden and potentially influencing the 2020 elections.\n\nIowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina are important states in presidential primary elections as they set the stage for the rest of the election.\n\nThe Iowa caucus will be held February 3 of next year, New Hampshire's primary is on February 11 and South Carolinians will hit the voting booths on February 29.", "description": "The majority of Democrats in early voting states want to see Trump in prison.
