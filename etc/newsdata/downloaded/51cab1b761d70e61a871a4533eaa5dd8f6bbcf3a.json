But increasingly, schools and districts are starting to sprinkle ethnic studies across the K-12 spectrum. Seattle is taking a highly unusual approach by weaving the field\u2019s multicultural and political questions not just through all grade levels, but into all subjects.\n\n\u201cSeattle is definitely on the forefront with this,\u201d said Robert Q. Berry III, the president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing follows the line of work we hope we can move forward as we think about the history of math and who contributes to that, and also about deepening students\u2019 connection with identity and agency.\u201d\n\nThe Education Week article includes a sidebar with articles on this left-wing proposal with titles that include:\n\n\u201cSeattle\u2019s framework reflects ideas and practices that NCTM has outlined in publications such as last year\u2019s \u2018Catalyzing Change in High School Mathematics,\u2019\u201d Education Week reported. \u201cThat report argues, among other things, for renewed focus on helping students see how math affects the lives of millions, in social media algorithms, polling data, and world finance.\u201d\n\nEducation Week also reported that this mash up of math and left-wing politics isn\u2019t a good idea:\n\nSeattle\u2019s proposed guidelines caused a furor on social media after Rod Dreher, an editor for The American Conservative, blogged about them on Sept. 30. In a Twitter thread dubbed #WokeMath, critics sneered at the district\u2019s blend of math and oppression, and zeroed in on parts of the framework that ask, \u201cHow important is it to be right?\u201d and \u201cWho gets to say if an answer is right?\u201d Seattle talk-radio host Dori Monson jumped into the fray on his own blog, asking, \u201cDid you realize when you subtracted one number from another that you were disenfranchising people by using Western math?\u201d Liz Wheeler, a host on One America News, tweeted that Seattle \u201cis now teaching kids as young as Kindergarten that math is racist.\u201d\n\nEducation Week interviewed a \u201ctop official\u201d in a math organization who asked to speak anonymously to avoid his name becoming part of the controversy.\n\n\u201cWe all want students of color to be included, believe they can learn math, and see themselves as mathematicians,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for them to learn about great contributions to mathematics from all cultures\u2014Indian and Chinese and Babylonian.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t need to talk about liberation and oppression and how Western mathematics has somehow taken over,\u201d he said. It just turns people off and makes the goal of being inclusive that much tougher.\u201d\n\nTracy Castro-Gill, Seattle\u2019s ethnic studies director, told Education Week that one Seattle elementary school has been trying out some of the ideas from the proposal, \u201cbut she wouldn\u2019t name the school \u2018because of the hate and vitriol\u2019 on social media.\u201d\n\nCastro-Gill defended the proposal.\n\n\u201cOf course there are right answers in math. We\u2019re not saying there aren\u2019t,\u201d Castro-Gill said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is that there are many ways of reaching conclusions, and that process should include dialogue.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf a student got the right answer, we should celebrate that ingenuity and intelligence instead of telling them there is only one way to get to that right answer,\u201d Castro-Gill said.\n\n\u201cSeattle\u2019s new math framework grew out of a 2017 community campaign, led by the NAACP, for more attention to ethnic studies,\u201d Education Week reported.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter.", "description": "Seattle schools are putting into place a K-12 curriculum to teach about how Western culture has \u201cappropriated\" math and used it to oppress minorities.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/teacher-classroom-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
