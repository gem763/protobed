It\u2019s Victoria\u2019s answer to IEM Sydney, and while the calibre of teams might not be equivalent to the premier Counter-Strike tournament held in May, the masses turned out for some thrilling action over two days, braving the late Sunday storm front and providing the industry with a much-needed boost of optimism.\n\nWith over 15 tournaments across the weekend, and plenty of exhibitors, free-play sessions and meet and greet events, MEO had plenty to offer. That\u2019s what makes MEO so special: it\u2019s everything the Australian esports industry needs to reach a wider audience.\n\n\u201cWatching the people come through the door, and it\u2019s very much different to our traditional esports audience,\u201d Ben Green, a commentator over the weekend and head of business development for ESL Australia, said.\n\nCommercially, Melbourne Esports Open is everything IEM Sydney isn\u2019t. You don\u2019t go to IEM Sydney for a family experience into gaming, and you don\u2019t attend the Melbourne Esports Open for world-class competition. But MEO is more palatable for a wider range of Aussies, which makes it great for brands and partners to dip their toe into esports.\n\nMeet Australia's New Esports Champions The Melbourne Esports Open festival was the finale for months of qualifiers and hard work for many of Oceania's best teams, with the event anointing Australian champions in Rainbow Six: Siege, Overwatch and League of Legends. Read more\n\n\u201cOn a commercial level, it makes sense, especially when we have a lot of partners coming to us wanting to get involved into esports and maybe Counter-Strike isn\u2019t their match,\u201d Green said. \u201cThere\u2019s not many events like this across the world where you\u2019ve taken all of these games and put them all together and it\u2019s just esports, so it\u2019s a great opportunity to try things out.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just for the outside looking in though. It\u2019s for the teams looking to engage with their fans. It\u2019s for the friends who live across the country, who might all love different games, but they all love games. It\u2019s for the kid wanting to show their parents what their world is all about, and the industry needs all of those communities to come together.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for all teams to interact with the fans,\u201d Sean Callanan, chief executive of the OPL team Gravitas, said. Gravitas didn\u2019t have the best 2019, but plenty still swarmed their stall for fun matches against the likes of Jackson \u201cPabu\u201d Pavone, Oceania\u2019s All-Star top laner.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been great to lock in some Gravitas fans in real life, and the cast is really diverse. The standard thing is that esports fans are 80% male, but we\u2019ve seen a much more diverse crowd than that,\u201d said Callanan.\n\nImage: Aaron Liew\n\nWith the closure of Gfinity and concerns over the scalability of Australian esports in the last two years \u2014 Channel Seven's plans for their own esports league were cancelled before it even got off the ground \u2014 the MEO turnout can only be a positive. The event caters to the casual audiences through open tournaments and freeplay booths, but draws fans in to the esports spectacle around Australia with the Oceanic Pro League, Six Masters, and the CouchWarriors fighting game community.\n\n\u201cTalking to fans at our booth has been like: Do you play League? Yes. Do you watch the OPL? No. We got a lot of \u201cNo\u2019s,\u201d and I asked why they don\u2019t follow. They often say that they play, but they don\u2019t see something is there. So they come in person, see something live, then follow it in the future,\u201d Callanan said.\n\nThe family-orientated feel of the event also brings esports and gaming into the household more, and from a young age. Ankle-biters were roaming around with their parents, especially on Father\u2019s Day, immersing themselves into the world of gaming in all of its quirky but wonderful ways.\n\n\u201c[MEO] is much more family-orientated. This could be any sporting event you\u2019d go to in Melbourne, and it\u2019s a very different feel. It\u2019s great to be able to showcase this as an event more appealing to the wider community,\u201d Green said.\n\nGeek Girl Academy chief executive Sarah Moran added that it\u2019s not just about seeing esports either. \u201cIt\u2019s been great to see a lot of young girls, women, and families from all across Victoria and inter-state turning up to celebrate esports and also learn about the industry. It\u2019s a new industry, and a broad range of people are now participating in it.\u201d\n\nIt's the foundation Australia needs. Sure, the games were exciting and thrilling, and as a diehard esports fan that was more than I could ask for. But what makes this event worthwhile was seeing the amount of people from all walks of life, descending on Melbourne for one common love: gaming.\n\nAndrew Amos is an Australian esports reporter for Dexerto and Snowball Esports.
