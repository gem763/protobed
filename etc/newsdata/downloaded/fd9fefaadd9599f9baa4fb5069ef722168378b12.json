Many people believe that the term \u201cshotgun house\u201d comes from the idea that a shotgun blast fired from the front door could go through the house and out the back door without hitting a wall.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDistinguished homes for sale in the D.C. region share Share Email this link Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn View Photos View Photos Next Image Capitol Hill shotgun house | The shotgun house is one of only two houses in this style remaining on Capitol Hill. It is listed at $1.3 million. (Tod Connell)\n\nBut the website of the Data Center, a research organization in southeast Louisiana, says the term may be a corruption of the word \u201cshogon.\u201d In West Africa, shogon means \u201cGod\u2019s house.\u201d Shotgun houses are widely recognized as an African American contribution to American architectural styles.\n\nThe house, one of only two shotgun houses remaining on Capitol Hill, was built circa 1850 by John Biegler, who operated a store on the block. Ernst Tungel, a German-born peddler, bought the house in 1853, and his family lived there for 40 years. When Daniel Hartley, a Maryland-born bricklayer, lived in the house, he added a rear outbuilding in 1917 and a brick kitchen in the 1930s.\n\nLarry Quillian bought the house in 1985, with plans to tear it down. But because the house is in a historic district, he ran into resistance from the Capitol Hill Restoration Society. For years, the CHRS opposed his redevelopment plans. The house remained uninhabited and an eyesore for decades, leading to acrimonious divisions within the neighborhood.\n\nBethesda-based architect and developer Sassan Gharai acquired the property three years ago. Gharai, who has a passion for unusual and historic houses, worked with the neighbors and the preservationists to devise a solution. They agreed that he would document, dismantle and reconstruct the house three feet west of its original foundation. This allowed him to build a second house next to the shotgun house, connecting both to the houses on either side. Because of the way the two houses are interconnected, they are technically considered condos.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDemolishing the shotgun [house] . . . is obviously not an ideal preservation outcome,\u201d wrote Steve Callcott in the Historic Preservation Review Board\u2019s staff report. \u201cHowever, after 30+ years of abandonment, neglect and deterioration, and after several failed attempts at redeveloping the site, the proposal may be the best and last possibility for retaining any aspect of this rare structure.\u201d\n\nAfter the house was dismantled, Gharai allowed a team of archaeologists to excavate the site. Their findings included a cellar with a number of intact bottles and items related to Germany.\n\nGharai added two levels to the original house, creating a bedroom and den on the second floor and a master suite on the top level.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat I love is as you go through it, it reveals itself to you,\u201d Gharai said.\n\nIn addition to the bedroom, the master suite includes a Gharai trademark, a second bedroom that he refers to as the \u201csnoring room.\u201d The suite also has a large walk-in closet and dressing area and an expansive bathroom with a soaking tub and steam shower.\n\nAD\n\nThe 14-foot ceilings make the living room feel spacious. The kitchen has plenty of storage and an island with seating. There\u2019s a deck on the back, and the two condos share three parking spaces.\n\n\u201cBased on the condition of the house by 2016, this is a good outcome,\u201d Purcell said. \u201cEven though it\u2019s a re-creation, people can see what one of these houses looked like. . . . You really need to make sure that you keep your treasures so that people can see them and appreciate them.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe three-bedroom, three-bathroom, 2,400-square-foot condo is listed at $1.3 million. An open house is scheduled for 1 to 4 p.m. Sunday.\n\nListing agent: McWilliams Ballard\n\nPrevious House of the Week\n\nMore Real Estate:\n\nAD", "description": "HOUSE OF THE WEEK | A dilapidated little house, circa 1850, is re-created as part of a two-unit condo project.", "authors": ["Kathy Orton", "Reporter", "Editor Covering The Washington Metropolitan Area Housing Market"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/r8VCa-NpJ_Mf9L2MRzpqlZUI_XU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DZTRS5XQ74I6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
