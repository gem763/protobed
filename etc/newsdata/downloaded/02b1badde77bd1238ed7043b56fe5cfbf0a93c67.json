His company controls nearly 40 percent of all e-commerce in the United States. It owns 42 percent of the paper-book market and a third of the streaming-video market. By one estimate, Amazon Web Services commands almost half of the cloud-computing industry, with institutions as varied as General Electric and the CIA relying on its servers. A new headquarters will soon be erected near Washington, D.C., where Bezos already owns The Washington Post. As Franklin Foer writes for the cover of The Atlantic\u2019s November issue, \u201cJeff Bezos has won capitalism. The question for democracy is, are we okay with that?\u201d\n\nFor the cover, \u201cJeff Bezos\u2019s Master Plan,\u201d Foer spent months speaking with current and former Amazon executives, as well as the company\u2019s rivals and scholarly observers, to understand Bezos\u2019s beliefs, ambitions, and motivations, as well as the implications of allowing one man to have so much power over so many corners of American life.\n\nAmazon is often included in conversations about breaking up Big Tech, but Foer writes that, unlike Facebook, Bezos\u2019s company remains deeply trusted by the public. \u201cIn contrast to the dysfunction and cynicism that define the times, Amazon is the embodiment of competence, the rare institution that routinely works.\u201d This is by design. When Bezos created Amazon in 1994, he set out to build \u201chis own aristocracy of brains, a place where intelligence would rise to the top.\u201d He molded the organization in his own image, and his attention to detail permeates the entire culture of the organization. \u201cIf you\u2019re going in for a Bezos meeting, you\u2019re preparing as if the world is going to end,\u201d a former executive told Foer. \u201cYou\u2019re like, I\u2019ve been preparing for the last three weeks. I\u2019ve asked every damn person that I know to think of questions that could be asked. Then Bezos will ask the one question you hadn\u2019t considered.\u201d", "description": "In The Atlantic\u2019s November issue, Franklin Foer reports on the global scale of the Amazon CEO\u2019s influence, and his ambitions beyond Earth", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/1119_Cover_PR1_1/facebook.jpg?1570730969", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
