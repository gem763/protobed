The question is whether it\u2019ll even be enough to partially lift natural gas prices from the doldrums of the past four weeks.\n\nOne Big Red Blot For Gas Prices This Year\n\nGas had a roller coaster ride in 2018, with futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange\u2019s Henry Hub reaching a near five-year high of $4.93 by November before closing the year at $2.94. From an annual gain of 60% at one point, the market ended just slightly in the negative.\n\nNatural Gas Daily Chart - Powered by TradingView\n\nAs for this year, it has been one huge red blot for gas futures, with only two months\u2014August and September\u2014in the positive, and even then up no more than 2% each. Year-to-date, the market is down nearly 24%, making natural gas the worst performer among commodities.\n\nAt Wednesday\u2019s settlement, Henry Hub\u2019s , November, settled at $2.234 per million British thermal units. Investing.com\u2019s Daily Technical Outlook has a \u201cStrong Sell\u201d on November, projecting a bottom as low as $2.132 per mmBtu.\n\nWith the official start to winter at least two months away, bets have been oscillating as to when real cold weather will kick in to throw a lifeline to market longs who had been brave enough to buck the trend.\n\nMore Demand Greatly Needed As Storage Levels Surge\n\nThe commodity critically needs a pick up in demand too, as storage additions in the fuel have been in the three digits for the past two weeks, after continued builds since April.\n\nAnalysts tracked by Investing.com have a forecast a of 97 billion cubic feet for last week, in data due from the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Thursday. Some traders, however, think the inventory build will be similar to the previous week\u2019s 112 bcf.\n\nDominick Chirichella, director of risk and trading at the Energy Management Institute in New York, said that storage aside, the coming days will be a test for the market when temperatures fall below the season's normal.\n\nSome Cold Weather Coming, But Will It Be Enough?\n\nSaid Chirichella:\n\n\u201cA major shot of cold weather will impact the West and Central U.S. over the next two to seven days.\"\n\n\u201cBelow normal temperatures should occur across the Northwest, especially the interior, but anomalies won't be significant.\u201d\n\nChirichella also acknowledged that the cold patch will not be hitting the key Northeast region, where the largest burning of gas for heat takes place.\n\nRisk Of More Price Weakness Ahead\n\nDan Myers, analyst at Houston-based gas consultancy Gelber & Associates, said even if Thursday\u2019s storage numbers come in below market expectations, \u201cthere is risk that the market may stumble when it looks to upcoming bearish injections in its wake\u201d.\n\nMyers also cast the ball further ahead, pointing to forecasts for continuously lower gas prices in 2020\u2014despite favorable production by next year forecast by the EIA\u2019s Short-Term Energy Outlook\u2014versus current record highs.\n\nScott Shelton, energy futures broker at ICAP in Durham, North Carolina, who has an upward bias toward gas, admitted to some of these bearish themes in a note issued on Wednesday.\n\nShelton\u2019s point basically was that Commodity Trading Advisors, which included hedge funds bearish on gas, had the market under their control:\n\n\u201cIn terms of flat price, it seems listless here, which is in line with the idea that we know what the end-October level is going to be, but we don\u2019t know what the weather is going to be.\u201d", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Investing.com (Barani Krishnan/Investing.com) covering: Natural Gas Futures.
