This is a commitment that the UK government signed up when led by Theresa May.\n\nThe EU has also been clear that the integrity of the European Single Market must be maintained and that there must be no get-out clauses for the UK a few years down the line.\n\nAll of those red lines are broken by this offer.\n\nAccording to the Telegraph report, Johnson's chief of staff Dominic Cummings told senior aides that \"if they reject our offer, that's it.\"\n\nYet Cummings and Johnson must know that this will be rejected. Indeed it is hard to come to any conclusion other than that rejection is precisely what these proposals are designed to achieve.\n\nAn offer the EU will have to refuse\n\nThe Godfather Getty\n\nJohnson was asked earlier this year by the Daily Mail what his favourite movie scene was and he replied that it was \"the multiple retribution killings at the end of 'The Godfather'.\"\n\nHowever, there was another scene from the film which better explains the situation Johnson has engineered.\n\nEarly in the movie, Michael Corleone explains how his father Vito once persuaded a bandleader to hire his godson by telling him that \"either his brains or his signature would be on the contract.\"\n\nJohnson's offer today appears to have the complete opposite intent. Rather than being an \"offer they can't refuse,\" this is an offer the EU will have no choice but to refuse.\n\nSo what is the UK playing at and where will this end up? There are two distinct possibilities.\n\n1. Bouncing the EU into a no-deal Brexit\n\nBoris Johnson and Jean-Claude Juncker Getty Johnson's government has a majority of minus 43 in the UK parliament. Even if by some miracle, the EU was to agree to these proposals, he has zero chance of getting it passed by members of Parliament.\n\nThat would appear to suggest that the UK is inevitably heading for a no-deal scenario on October 31.\n\nHowever, earlier this month MPs passed a new law which would compel Johnson to request a fresh Brexit delay if no deal has been secured by October 19.\n\nThis would be a nightmare scenario for the prime minister given his repeated insistence that there is \"no circumstances\" under which he would allow Brexit to be delayed.\n\nBut Downing Street understands that while the so-called Benn act will compel them to request a new extension to Article 50, it does not compel EU leaders to accept one.\n\nBy making such an unreasonable offer to the EU, Johnson could be hoping to bounce Brussels into rejecting any further delay. After all, what is the point for the EU of delaying Brexit for a third time when the UK government appears totally unwilling to agree to any of their demands for a deal after another delay?\n\nSo is this what Downing Street is attempting? It may be, but there is another possibility.\n\n2. Setting up the EU to take the blame for a Brexit delay\n\nConservative Party Conference in Manchester Getty Whatever the claims from Johnson that he is determined to leave the EU on October 31 \"do or die,\" his government has not made enough serious preparation for the UK to leave the EU without a deal at the end of October. Anyone who has travelled through Britain's ports in recent weeks will have looked in vain for the massive new infrastructure required to cope with the new checks required for a no-deal scenario. And while many businesses are stockpiling for the possibility of their supplies being held up at ports, as Business Insider revealed earlier this year, there is nowhere near the sort of warehousing space required to seriously prepare for a no-deal exit and no time at all to create it.\n\nRead more: No-deal Brexit stockpiling panic as British businesses warn warehouses are already booked up for Christmas\n\nThat means that a no-deal Brexit would be a disastrous outcome, not just for the UK economy, but for the government which chose to put the country through it. For this reason it remains difficult to believe that this is seriously the outcome that either Johnson, or the EU, will ultimately go for.\n\nWhatever the briefings to the contrary, another Brexit delay therefore remains the most likely outcome at the end of October, which means that the main priority for Downing Street now is to prepare the ground for who will get the blame for it.\n\nIn the past week, Johnson's team has spent a lot of effort seeking to push most of that blame onto the UK parliament, with friendly newspapers briefed with the suggestion that British MPs are engaged in \"foreign collusion\" with the EU in order to frustrate Brexit.\n\nTaken in that context, today's offer appears to have a similar design. By offering something that will be impossible for the EU to accept, the UK can then blame the EU for rejecting it, while avoiding getting dragged into lengthy negotiations which in themselves would require an agreement to delay Brexit.\n\nOf course none of this amounts to a real attempt to, in the words of the Conservative Party's conference slogan this week, \"get Brexit done.\" At best it is yet another attempt to put off the difficult choices that Brexit requires and at worst it is a reckless strategy that risks a disastrous outcome for the UK economy.", "description": "Boris Johnson is acting like Vito Corleone in the Godfather, only this is an offer the EU will have no choice but to refuse.", "authors": ["Adam Bienkov"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d94578d8bd8ec016514cf53?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
