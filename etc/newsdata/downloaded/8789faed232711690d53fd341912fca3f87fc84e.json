The timing of memory recovery remains uncertain,\" ASML President and Chief Executive Peter Wennink said.\n\nASML said it is revising its capital return policy to introduce dividend payments on a semi-annual basis and declared an interim dividend for 2019 of EUR1.05 a share.\n\nThe company said it has repurchased shares worth EUR1.4 billion to date under an existing share buyback program, but that it doesn't anticipate to buy back the full EUR2.5 billion of shares within the 2018-19 timeframe.\n\nWrite to Adria Calatayud at adria.calatayudvaello@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 16, 2019 01:36 ET (05:36 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
