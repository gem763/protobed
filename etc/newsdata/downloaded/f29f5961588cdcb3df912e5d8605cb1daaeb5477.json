The government decides which unfinished bills it wants to keep and reintroduces them in the new parliamentary session. The rest are simply dropped.\n\nThe trade bill, once considered one of the most important pieces of Brexit legislation, is one such bill to have been abandoned.\n\nIt is always unusual for a government to deliberately drop legislation \u2013 why introduce something you don\u2019t intend to pass? \u2013 but the case of the trade bill, in particular, should concern us all. Its death means MPs now won\u2019t get a say on our post-Brexit trade deals. Politicians in both houses of parliament worked to amend the bill over a period of two years. The amendment gave MPs a guaranteed vote on post-Brexit trade agreements, such as any deal with Donald Trump.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBelieve it or not, without the amendment proposed in that bill the UK\u2019s system of trade deal ratification doesn\u2019t give MPs any meaningful or guaranteed say over the country's trade agreements. So as things stand, after Brexit we will revert to a World War I convention called the \"Ponsonby rule\" for ratifying international deals. This convention severely limits the role of MPs; it was created to deal with secret defence treaties, long before trade deals were as globally significant as they are now.\n\nThe amendment would have replaced this outdated system with a meaningful vote for MPs on all trade deals. The concern felt by many MPs and Lords reflected that of many civil society organisations \u2013 including trade unions, faith groups, environmental NGOs and consumer groups \u2013 that, without accountability to parliament, the government would sign deals which are politically expedient and yet bad for the country.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 20 pictures that sum up President Trump's visit Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

AFP/Getty\n\nDemocratic scrutiny of trade deals matters because trade deals themselves matter. Reports about chlorinated chicken are just the tip of the iceberg: post-Brexit trade deals could see an overall shift away from the EU\u2019s regulatory system towards a more US-style system. The US has a more business-first approach to regulation, which allows practices including hormone-fed meat, the routine use of antibiotics in agriculture, GM crops, poor animal welfare protections, the use of pesticides banned in the EU, and more. For many ardent Brexiters, escaping EU regulations is a key benefit to leaving. For civil society organisations, losing these regulations would be a disaster.\n\nTrade deals also affect our public services, and could be used to \"lock-in\" privatisation of the NHS. Trump has made it a priority to tackle what he sees as an unfair drug pricing system, which keeps prices low for patients but disadvantages US pharmaceutical firms, and this is likely to be a key demand in US-UK negotiations.\n\nTrade deals also increasingly include Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) mechanisms which would allow foreign multinationals to sue the UK government for policies which harm their profits. ISDS has been used to challenge important environmental legislation in the past - including measures to control water pollution and ban fracking. It is difficult to see how this is compatible with the UK\u2019s Paris climate change commitments, let alone the legally binding pledge for net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nRegardless of your views on American food standards, privatisation of the NHS or ISDS arrangements, it is essential that our elected representatives get a say on these issues. While parliament\u2019s prorogation has rightly provoked outrage for taking power out of MPs\u2019 hands, our approach to ratifying trade deals is not very different. Our own MPs would struggle to stop a US trade deal even if it were roundly unpopular and believed to be harmful.\n\nThe democratic scrutiny amendment passed through the Lords, defeating the government with the support of Labour, Liberal Democrat, Green and crossbench peers. It was therefore written into the bill that was ready to be returned to MPs in the Commons. This final stage then never happened \u2013 possibly because the government knew it would face defeat and that important amendment would become law.\n\nWhether the next few months see a general election, a new legislative agenda or no-deal Brexit, it is essential that MPs are given a say on any new trade agreements. The Queen\u2019s Speech is an opportunity to reassure MPs that they will have this say; otherwise, Boris Johnson should expect repeated defeats on any future trade legislation.\n\nDavid Lawrence is senior political advisor at the Trade Justice Movement, a network of 60 civil society organisations campaigning for trade rules that work for people and planet.", "description": "Boris Johnson\u2019s controversial decision to prorogue parliament did many things, but at its most basic level the break from ordinary parliamentary business simply means that an old legislative session comes to an end and a new one begins.
