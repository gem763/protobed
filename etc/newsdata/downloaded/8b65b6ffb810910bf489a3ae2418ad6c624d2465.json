She feels compelled to do it. She feels that God put her on the Earth to do it. But she\u2019s hesitant because she realizes the timing is bad.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s got to wait until Biden drops out because he\u2019s obviously next in line for it, and if he goes away, there\u2019s an opening for her\n\nSince losing to Donald Trump in 2016, Hillary has revisited her campaign\u2019s failures, alternately blaming Russia, Benie Sanders, the FBI, WikiLeaks, and misogyny for her loss at the ballot box. Along the way, rumors of a possible rerun of 2016 have simmered away.\n\nMost of these rumors have been just that \u2013 rumors. Though her former adviser Philippe Reines told Politico last year that while Clinton\u2019s chances of actually running in 2020 are \u201csomewhere between highly unlikely and zero,\u201d he appeared on Fox News on Wednesday night again to keep the door open.\n\n\u201cShe ran for president because she thought she would be the best president,\u201d he told host Tucker Carlson. \u201cThere might be a reason that she would be the best person, not only to beat Donald Trump, but to govern after Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Hillary Clinton\u2019s attacks on Tulsi Gabbard sow more Democratic division than Moscow could ever dream of\n\nIndeed, Hillary\u2019s opportunity may come around soon. Joe Biden, the only centrist among the current crop of frontrunners, has had trouble raising funds recently, and has stumbled through a series of embarrassing gaffes on the campaign trail. Meanwhile left-wing candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have pulled ahead.\n\nIf Biden drops out, Morris said \u201call the Democrats are going to say, \u2018Oh my God, are we going to nominate Elizabeth Warren\u2026 We need a moderate to come out.\u2019 And Hillary will dust off her credentials and say, \u2018I\u2019m a moderate. I was that when my husband was president and I\u2019ll be that now.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cMake no mistake. She wants it,\u201d he added. \u201cShe\u2019s planning on it. She\u2019ll do everything she can to achieve it.\u201d\n\nThough he once advised Hillary\u2019s husband, Morris is not hoping for another Clinton presidency himself. Once one of Bill\u2019s closest and most trusted advisers, he has since switched his allegiance to the Republican party, and swore in 2008 that he would leave the US if Hillary Clinton was elected president.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
