It fell 4 points to 77% last month.\n\nLast Friday, the Labor Department said nonfarm payrolls grew by 130,000 in August, fewer than the 148,000 forecast among analysts polled by Reuters. Job growth has slowed since mid-2018.\n\nMeanwhile, the gap between those who say mortgage rates will decline over the next 12 months and those who see them rising shrank to 17% in August, the smallest level seen in the history of the survey.\n\nThe component on mortgage rates was the only one of six that improved from the month before.\n\nFor example, the net share of respondents who said it was a good time to buy a home dipped 1 point to 25%, while the net share who said it was good time to sell a home fell 4 points to 40%, Fannie Mae said.\n\nWhile consumers' mood to buy and sell a home weakened a bit, the housing sector will likely be supported by cheaper borrowing costs, Duncan said.\n\n\"We do expect housing market activity to remain relatively stable, and the favorable rate environment should continue supporting increased refinance activity,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)", "description": "The largest U.S. home finance agency said its index on home purchase sentiment moved up 0.1 percentage point to 93.8 last month, the highest level since this measure began.
