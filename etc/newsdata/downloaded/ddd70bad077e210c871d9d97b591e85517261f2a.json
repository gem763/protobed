Add Interest\n\nSeasonal flu \u201ckills tens of thousands of Americans each year,\u201d Alex Azar, secretary of Health and Human Services, said in a statement. A faster vaccine production process would help keep Americans safe from both types of flu outbreaks, Azar said.\n\nThursday's executive action ordered the creation of a flu vaccine task force, with input from various federal agencies and headed up by Azar and the secretary of defense. For now, the executive order does not allocate any additional funding toward vaccine development or production.\n\nScientists develop each year\u2019s flu vaccine months or even up to a year in advance, but vaccine efficacy can vary widely. In recent years, the flu vaccine has not been well-matched to that year\u2019s virus. In 2018, for example, the flu vaccine was only 30% effective.\n\nRegardless of efficacy in a given year, medical professionals still recommend getting the flu vaccine, which greatly reduces influenza hospitalizations overall.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been struggling for about 10 years now,\u201d Richard Webby, a faculty member in the infectious disease department at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, told ABC News.\n\nFaster methods of producing influenza vaccines will help keep Americans safer both from seasonal influenza, which kills tens of thousands of Americans each year, and from the potential of pandemic influenza, which is the single greatest biodefense threat our country faces. \u2014 Secretary Alex Azar (@SecAzar) September 19, 2019\n\nWhen manufacturers produce each year\u2019s stock of vaccines, they either grow the virus in animal cells or in fertilized chicken eggs. Part of the problem in recent years, the virus has mutated when introduced into the chicken eggs.\n\n\u201cWe pick a strain that we think is going to be well-matched, but when that virus goes into eggs, it changes a bit,\u201d explained Webby. But that doesn\u2019t mean that we should give up on eggs, which have long been the mainstay for flu vaccine production, Webby said, nothing that instead, we should diversify our vaccine portfolio.\n\nSarah Silbiger/Reuters\n\nDr. Peter Hotez, professor and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, told ABC News that while he appreciated the president highlighting \"one of our greatest infectious disease threats,\u201d he didn\u2019t understand why flu vaccine development and innovation had been so sluggish.\n\nIt\u2019s also not clear how Trump\u2019s task force advances the flu vaccine efforts made by previous administrations, experts said. Past presidents had similarly prioritized and allocated funding for vaccines, including $91 million in 2013 to GlaxoSmithKline and the Texas A&M University System, to develop flu vaccine manufacturing facility.\n\nStill, Hotez acknowledged barriers to rapid innovation. \u201cThe profit margin for flu vaccinations is not high,\u201d he said. \u201cIt requires quite a lot of upfront investment to completely re-do an age-old manufacturing process.\u201d\n\nHe also stressed the value in a national push to develop what he called the dream vaccine, a universal flu vaccine Americans could receive once and be protected in future years, instead of returning year after year for immunization against the latest virus.\n\n\"Why are we still tethered to 20th-century technology?\u201d", "description": "President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday aimed at developing better flu vaccines to defend Americans against influenza.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/trump-rt-ps-190917_hpMain_2_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
