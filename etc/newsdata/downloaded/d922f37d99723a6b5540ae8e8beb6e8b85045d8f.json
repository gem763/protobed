Barker drew a comparison between the SpongeBob SquarePants cartoon and real-life events in the Marshall Islands' Bikini Atoll.\n\n'SpongeBob Squarepants and his friends play a role in normalizing the settler colonial takings of indigenous lands while erasing the ancestral Bikinian people from their nonfictional homeland,' Barker wrote, according to Fox 35.\n\nA University of Washington professor wrote an article claiming that the SpongeBob SquarePants series (pictured) 'whitewashes US military rampages' on Pacific Island natives\n\nThe statements are based on the popular fan theory that the series is set in the ocean beneath the Bikini Atoll (left), which the US military used as nuclear testing ground (right) during the Cold War, resulting in high levels of radiation in the area\n\nThe popular animated series revolves around the adventures of a yellow sea sponge that lives in a pineapple under the sea. SpongeBob and his friends - including a starfish, squid and squirrel - all live in a town called Bikini Bottom.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the US military moved natives out of the Bikini Atoll so that they could perform nuclear testing in the area. As a result, the area's is said to be contaminated with so much radiation that natives were unable to return there to live. Those that did, experienced radiation-related issues including genetic abnormalities, stillbirths and miscarriages.\n\nConsequently, one of the Top 10 fan theories, according to Mental Floss, is that SpongeBob and the other talking and walking Bikini Bottom sea creature residents are the result of mutations caused by the radiation on the Bikini Atoll above them.\n\nIn the article, Barker wrote that SpongeBob, an 'American character,' living in an area that natives were forced to leave shows his privilege of 'not caring about the detonation of nuclear bombs.'\n\n'The detonations do not cause concern for the characters, as they did for the Bikinians, nor do they compromise SpongeBob's frequent activities, like visiting hamburger joints or the beach with friends,' Barker wrote, according to Campus Reform.\n\nAnthropology professor Holly M. Barker (pictured) criticized SpongeBob SquarePants because it 'normalizes' colonial settlers taking indigenous lands\n\nBarker noted the series also includes Pacific Island cultural appropriation by having characters wear Hawaiian-style shirts and having them live in pineapple-shaped homes (shown)\n\nThe series also has one character living in an Easter Island head-shaped home. An actual Easter Island head is shown at left, while the series' recreation of it is at right\n\nBy watching the show, Barker argued that children 'become acculturated to an ideology that includes the U.S. character SpongeBob (pictured) residing on another people\u2019s homeland'\n\nBarker also wrote that setting the show in the Bikini Atoll region is 'symbolic violence' and noted that the character's 'presence on Bikini Bottom continues the violent and racist expulsion of Indigenous peoples from their lands (and in this case their cosmos) that enables U.S. hegemonic powers to extend their military and colonial interests in the postwar era.'\n\nBy watching the show, Barker argues, children 'become acculturated to an ideology that includes the U.S. character SpongeBob residing on another people\u2019s homeland.'\n\n'The settling of SpongeBob Squarepants and his friends into Bikini Bottom is connected to broader entanglements of military colonialism in the Marshall Islands that include dispossession from and destruction of the land, exploitation of the people and their resources, and an othering of the Bikinian and Marshallese people,' Barker wrote.\n\nAt the same time, Barker pointed to the fact that the series includes cultural appropriation of Pacific Island culture, including the fact that many characters wear Hawaiian-style shirts, homes are built in the shapes of pineapples and Easter Island heads and the prevalence of steel guitar music on the show's soundtrack.\n\n'Despite being a presented as a nonsensical and harmless cartoon, SpongeBob shapes global perceptions of the actual place called Bikini,' she added.\n\nIn the article, which appeared in the recent issue of The Contemporary Pacific: A Journal of Island Affairs, Barker wrote that while it was likely that the series creators didn't intend 'to infuse a children's show with racist, violent colonial practices,' the series does play a role in the larger issue of an 'insidious practice of disappearing Indigenous communities.'\n\nBarker wrote that the series 'desensitizes viewers to the violence of settler colonialism, normalizes and erases the displacement of the Bikinian people from their ancestral land, and whitewashes US military rampages on the islands in the history and narratives of Bikini.'\n\nBarker also called it 'disturbing' that the series creators did not understand that \u2018Bikini Bottom and Bikini Atoll were not theirs for the taking.'\n\nShe then ended the article by noting that: 'We should be uncomfortable with a hamburger-loving American community\u2019s occupation of Bikini\u2019s lagoon and the ways that it erodes every aspect of sovereignty.'\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants celebrated its 20th anniversary on Friday. Series creator Stephen Hillenburg died from heart failure related to ALS in November 2018.", "description": "University of Washington anthropology professor Holly M.
