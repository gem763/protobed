His work range from baseball to the Civil War.\n\nBurns\u2019 latest documentary is an eight-part series on country music, an art form that is uniquely American.\n\nHe says country music is universal, from its multi-ethnic origins to its familiar emotional messages.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nFollowing is a copy of the transcript.\n\nLionel Moise: For more than 40 years, Ken Burns has produced documentaries about life in America.\n\nHe\u2019s covered baseball, the Civil War, jazz and National Parks, and his latest documentary is an eight part series on country music, a uniquely American art form. The series recently premiered on PBS and is currently streaming on PBS.org.\n\nI want to get right into it, what do think country music teaches us about being American?\n\nKen Burns: Well I think it\u2019s one of the great subjects that we\u2019ve ever taken on, that goes with the Civil War, the most important event in American history.\n\nThis is a great story about race. Many people don\u2019t understand the African American component to the founding of country music.\n\nThe banjo comes from Africa, the fiddle from the British Isles.\n\nIt\u2019s never been one sound, it\u2019s always been a mixture. And I think it\u2019s incredibly emotional.\n\nWhen somebody says, \u201cI\u2019m so lonesome, I could cry,\u201d as Hank Williams did, there\u2019s nobody on the planet that hasn\u2019t experienced that.\n\nMoise: And you\u2019re tearing up as you\u2019re saying it and now transferring that emotion here. You know you really do dive into different topics throughout the docu-series and covering the different areas of it.\n\nSomeone who is not familiar with country music and maybe wasn\u2019t a fan before, what do you think is one thing that they would take away from this film?\n\nBurns: Well I think I made it for them.\n\nI mean I know that country fans will come along and they might quibble, \u201cOh you\u2019ve left this person out.\u201d Or, \u201cYou didn\u2019t do my favourite song.\u201d But I really made it for the people who aren\u2019t aware of it.\n\nAnd I think it\u2019s just the emotionalism. If you think that country music is its own separate island nation in which you need a visa or a passport to get to any other form of music, you\u2019re wrong.\n\nWhen Ray Charles was given creative control of an album for the first time in 1962, he surprised everybody in his scene by recording an album called Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music.\n\nAnd the number one hit across the country in the summer of \u201962 was I Can\u2019t Stop Loving You, a Don Gibson country song.\n\nAnd if you listen to it, it\u2019s a country song being sung by a soul singer.\n\nAnd then I don\u2019t really have to say anything about Lil Nas X which is my mic drop moment, it\u2019s not in our film because we\u2019re a history and we stop at the death of Johnny Cash in 2003, but if you\u2019ve got a black, gay rapper who\u2019s got the number one country song of all times, then it tells you that this isn\u2019t just a segregated music.\n\nAnywhere in America, their borders are porous and that\u2019s our strength.\n\nMoise: Certainly bringing us together.\n\nNow you spent more than eight years working on this project, what is something that surprised you the most?\n\nBurns: Every day.\n\nI mean I went in, I was a child of R&B and rock and roll and so almost everything was a surprise to me. But I think it tells you the power of stories.\n\nCharlie Parker, the great jazz great, was feeding jukeboxes on 52nd street in the \u201940s playing country music, playing Hank Williams, playing I\u2019m So Lonesome I Could Cry and the Cats were saying, his fellow band members were saying, \u201cBird what are you doing? Why are you playing that?\u201d\n\nAnd he says, \u201cListen to the stories.\u201d\n\nMoise: We know that music has certainly impacted our country.\n\nBurns: We have a corporate underwriter, Bank of America, that\u2019s been supporting our work for the last 13 years and just signed up for the next 10 years.\n\nAnd they have a tagline that accompanies their credit at the beginning and the end of every episode and it says, \u201cNothing connects the country like country.\u201d\n\nAnd we need that right now. We\u2019re so divided.\n\nEverything is a polarity, everything is, you know, a dialectic, everything\u2019s about pointing out differences. Everything\u2019s binary.\n\nWhen I\u2019ve learned, studying the US and also the lowercase us, that there\u2019s only us, there\u2019s no them.\n\nCountry music it reminds us we\u2019re all in the same boat together.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
