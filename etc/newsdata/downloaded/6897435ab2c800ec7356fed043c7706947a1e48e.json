If anyone wants to resolve it sooner they should say so and challenge for the leadership at the party conference in three weeks.\u201d\n\nHer words were greeted with applause, but there is no mistaking the fact that rivals are circling her.\n\n\u201cThe CDU can no longer ignore the election results from Thuringia or just sit them out,\u201d Friedrich Merz, the man she narrowly beat to the party leadership last year, tweeted in a clear warning shot.\n\nMs Kramp-Karrenbauer has now presided over heavy losses in the European elections and regional elections in three German states.\n\nMike Mohring, the CDU regional regional leader in Thuringia, lost no time in blaming AKK for the debacle Credit: FRIEDEMANN VOGEL/EPA-EFE/REX More\n\nFollowing previous losses, she moved into the cabinet as defence minister in an attempt to shore up her position.\n\nBut she came under fire in the run-up to the Thuringia election for getting involved in a damaging cabinet row over Syria policy with Heiko Maas, the foreign minister.\n\n\u201cThese sort of state election results are not disconnected from what\u2019s happening at a national level,\u201d Reiner Haseloff, a senior CDU figure, told German television.\n\nMike Mohring, the CDU regional leader in Thuringia, lost no time in blaming AKK for the debacle. \u201cBerlin was not helpful in the weeks leading up to the election,\u201d he said.\n\nThe CDU leadership has agreed to Mr Mohring\u2019s demand to be allowed to open coalition talks with the Left Party in Thuringia.\n\nThe CDU has previously always refused to consider any coalition with the AfD or the Left Party.\n\nBut the two parties dominated the Thuringian election results and no coalition is possible without one of them.\n\nThe Left Party, a successor to the former East German Communist Party, came first in the state with 31 per cent.\n\nMr Mohring contends it is the lesser of two evils compared to the AfD, whose lead candidate in the state, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, has been compared to Hitler by German national television.", "description": "Angela Merkel\u2019s chosen successor came under intense pressure on Monday after disastrous regional election results saw her party suffer crushing losses to the nationalist Alternative for Germany party (AfD).
