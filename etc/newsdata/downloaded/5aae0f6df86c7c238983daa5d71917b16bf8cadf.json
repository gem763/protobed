He's been doing the Lord's work.\n\n\n\n2. Paul has his lazy journalism pants on. To say Cam has brought the Panthers organization down clearly means he doesn't watch NFL football since 2011.

It is the end. It's over for Cam Newton,\" Finebaum said. \"I don't know why we're mincing words and trying to find a pretty way to put it. He's a train wreck right now. He can't do what he used to do. And quite frankly, forget the sympathy tour.\n\n\u201cCam Newton has never really cared about anyone other than Cam Newton \u2026 He\u2019s brought this franchise down. It's over for Cam Newton. Nice knowing you, but you\u2019re done.\u201d\n\n[Watch NFL games on your phone for FREE with the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nClark, though, didn\u2019t appreciate the take \u2014 especially after Finebaum has just finished praising Manning.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"This is my only statement to that,\" Clark responded. \"We just spoke \u2014 not we, Paul \u2014 glowingly about Eli Manning, and he has taken a dud for the last four years. You want to talk about bringing a franchise down? Eli has ruined that franchise. So we got to take out how we feel about dudes because he's a Manning, because we love him ... If we look at it right now, Cam has more left than Eli has had for years. We have to take out how we feel about dudes and the way that they act \u2026 that\u2019s not how it works. (Newton) has killed himself for his team.\u201d\n\nNewton has struggled in the Panthers\u2019 first two games of the season, completing just 56 percent of his passes for 572 yards with one interception and one fumble. The 30-year-old has yet to score a touchdown, and Carolina has dropped both games.\n\nWhile Newton\u2019s start has been slow \u2014 which Finebaum and others have taken as a potential end of his career \u2014 Manning has had a rough few seasons with the New York Giants.\n\nManning has won just eight games in New York the past three seasons, and has only recorded one winning record since 2012. He led the Giants to a pair of rough opening games this year \u2014 including a blowout season-opening loss to the Dallas Cowboys. The two-time Super Bowl champion and former Walter Payton Man of the Year award winner simply looks nothing like he once was, causing some to doubt a future spot in the Hall of Fame.\n\nThough one can debate Manning and Newton any number of ways, Clark\u2019s point was simple: Just because Newton is a very different quarterback, and a very different person, than Manning is doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t care.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop treating dudes like because they play a certain way or because they act a certain way that\u2019s not familiar to us, that that\u2019s not leadership, that that\u2019s not caring,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThat\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Ryan Clark and Paul Finebaum got after it on Wednesday in a heated debate about Cam Newton and Eli Manning.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TCITC_WQxblhNf73bSkLrg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MTUuMg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/if.VT63dQxE5ThOEWbXrrg--~B/aD0yNzcyO3c9Mzg3NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/2175cad0-da99-11e9-adff-8e85fa064efd", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
