When the team-sheets were handed out, there was more than a whiff of anticipation in south London. Manchester City could not even muster a regular centre half. They had Joao Cancelo and Benjamin Mendy playing as full backs, not renowned for their dedication to defensive duties. We had a Manchester City team who, having been upset by Norwich, had fallen at home to Wolves in their last outing.\n\nRoy Hodgson is never knowingly overexcited and scoffed prophetically pre match when asked if City\u2019s back four gave him some hope for the afternoon. Of course it was Manchester City, one of the great teams in English football history. But there Wilfried Zaha to exploit that space. There was the unshakeable efficiency of a team coached by Hodgson. And there was a sense that, maybe, just maybe City were vulnerable.\n\nIt is the measure of this team that they generally clear these kind of hurdles comfortably, take them in their stride like an Olympic athlete, barely brushing them as sprint onwards to the next goal. It is true that for 40 minutes, their chances were limited to the kind that look good in the stats, shots that require saves but are unlikely to break the deadlock. Yet Gabriel Jesus eventually found a way through. Then David Silva scored one of the most delightful goals you will see this season. And then they left to fly home, job done, points in the bag.\n\nManchester City strolled past Crystal Palace with ease on Saturday night in their first game since the international break\n\nCity were looking to bounce back from their shock loss to Wolves before the international break and did so emphatically\n\nMATCH FACTS Crystal Palace (4-3-3) : Hennessey; van Aanholt, Tomkins (Dann 83), Cahill, Ward; Milivojevic (Benteke 76), McArthur, Kouyate; Schlupp (Townsend 55), Zaha, Ayew Subs not used: Henderson, McCarthy, Meyer, Riedewald Booked: Milivojevic Goals: Manager: Roy Hodgson Manchester City (3-1-4-2): Ederson; Cancelo, Fernandinho, Mendy; Rodri; D Silva (Stones 79), Gundogan, De Bruyne (Foden 90), B Silva; Jesus, Sterling Subs not used: Aguero, Bravo, Angelino, Garcia, Mahrez Booked: Sterling Goals: Jesus (39), D Silva (40) Manager: Pep Guardiola Referee: Anthony Taylor Stadium: Selhurst Park\n\nIndeed it was only in the final 13 minutes of the game that their make-shift defence was ever properly tested. The clock was on 77 minutes when Christian Benteke rose to meet a corner with a header, his very first touch after coming on. Ederson did brilliantly to touch away on to the bar. On 89 minutes Ederson again scrambled away a Zaha shot athletically. It fell for Jordan Ayew, a few yards out, the path to goal clear. Yet he hurried is volley, launching it far over the cross bar. It was all too little too late.\n\nThis isn\u2019t yet a major recovery for City. They will need Liverpool to drop points at Old Trafford to feel it was a significant weekend. But it was reminder that they are far too good and will accumulate far too many points for Liverpool ever to relax this season.\n\nCrystal Palace seemed well set. Roy Hodgson had them set up 4-5-1. Manchester City had been restricted to innocuous crosses and long-range shots. Of course they were dominating possession. But not with the elan they usually do.\n\nIn the aftermath of their defeat at home to Wolves, they had a back four which included two midfielders. Selhurst Park was anticipating something special. Maybe not quite as special at the 3-2 win at The Etihad last season; but at least an evening in which City\u2019s centre half pairing of Rodri and Fernandinho and those attacking full backs were stretched to the full.\n\nAnd all was going to plan until the 40th minute. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t matter how you break the deadlock, just important that you do. Bernardo Silva swung the cross in and it looked like it might be beyond Gabriel Jesus. Diving at it, unsighted, it rebounded off head and shoulder on to the post and into the net. It wasn\u2019t especially pretty. But it did the trick.\n\nGabriel Jesus' diving header opened the scoring for Manchester City as the champions looked to bounce back on Saturday\n\nThat strike was the Brazilian's 50th goal for Manchester City as the 22-year-old started ahead of star man Sergio Aguero\n\nManchester City players congratulate team-mate Jesus after their long awaited goal in the first half against Crystal Palace\n\nCity's lead was doubled within thirty seconds as Raheem Sterling chipped a delightful pass to City captain David Silva\n\nThe Spaniard made no mistake and wheels away in celebration after putting his side in a commanding position at Selhurst\n\nThe lead taken, City took just 93 seconds to extend it. Palace attacked from the kick off but Kevin de Bruyne won the ball back, sprinted half the pitch on the counter, found Bernardo who worked the ball across to Raheem Sterling via a touch from Benjamin Mendy.\n\nWhat happened next was sublime. With a little flick, Sterling scooped the ball over the Palace defence. David Silva, anticipating that as though it were the most natural thing in the world, had sprinted beyond them, tracked the ball all the time it looped over his shoulder and struck it sweetly, nut-megging Hennessey to make it 2-0. It was an outstanding pass and finish.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t game over, it was certainly now a very different type of team tack Hodgson would have to prepare for half time. Sometimes City get a little lucky, as with the first finish. Yet sometimes they are simply unplayable, as with the second. And that rather scuppers the best laid plans.\n\nCrystal Palace goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey is called into action to deny Manchester City striker Gabriel Jesus in the first half\n\nJeffrey Schlupp was deployed at left wing for Palace but had to put in the hard yards to keep City from creating chances\n\nCrystal Palace's Joel Ward and Manchester City star Raheem Sterling battle it out for possession of the ball in the first half\n\nRaheem Sterling and Crystal Palace's Wilfried Zaha were in constant battle on the right flank throughout the first half\n\nPalace hadn\u2019t bothered too much to go on the offensive. There were huge roars on the two occasions when Wilfired Zaha was played in or when Rodrigo slipped and allowed a run at goal before Sterling, tracking back, robbed him. But it was clearly a tactic to be unleashed later in the game. That, though relied on them getting to half time goal-less, which they couldn\u2019t manage.\n\nCome the re-start, Palace at least demonstrated some fight when Joel Ward took issue with Sterling for a late challenge, the two squaring up aggressively. The England winger earned a booking. And Palace were also registering shots in the direction of goal, a neat one-two saw James McArthur set up Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 on 50 mins, but he shot rather wildly over from the edge of the box.\n\nPep Guardiola instructs his players as City search for the all important opening goal of the game at Selhurst Park\n\nManchester City star Kevin de Bruyne returned to the starting lineup having been sidelined for the Wolves defeat with injury\n\nManchester City had a penalty shout waved away after Kevin de Bruyne was brought down by Wilfried Zaha in the Palace box\n\nOn a day where technology had an effect on almost every Premier League game, VAR did not overturn the referee's decision\n\nChristian Benteke almost made an immediate impact from the bench for Palace only to be denied by City goalkeeper Ederson\n\nSterling was a growing influence, digging out a shot on 53 minutes which rebounded off the post. Yet the introduction of Andros Townsend offered fresh hope. Palace needed at least to challenge City\u2019s make-shift back line. However, they were making little headway.\n\nAnd they were fortunate to escape a VAR review on 63 minutes. Kevin De Bruyne burst into the box, Zaha tracking him. De Bruyne had probably nudged the ball to far ahead but even so the barge into him and the hand on the back were fouls nonetheless. Anthony Taylor judged it minimal contact. The VAR declined to overturn the decision.\n\nCity continued to make all the running Gabriel Jesus exchanging passes, bursting across the box and unleash a shot which Hennessey did well to turn away at full stretch on 68 minutes.", "description": "ROB DRAPER AT SELHURST PARK: Manchester City bounced back from their shock defeat to Wolves with a 2-0 victory over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Saturday night.", "authors": ["Rob Draper For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/19/19932248-0-image-a-150_1571509284064.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
