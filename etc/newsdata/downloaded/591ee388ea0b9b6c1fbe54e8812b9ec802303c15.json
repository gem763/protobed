Maranan said they are preparing murder charges against both suspects.\n\nBolinao Executive Senior Police Officer Alma de la Cruz, who spoke to Coconuts Manila on the phone this afternoon, said the pair had been identified by a witness, though the witness is being left unnamed for the time being.\n\nAccording to Rappler, Remiendo\u2019s bloodied body was found yesterday on the shore of a beach in Patar. Police said that, based on their investigation, Remiendo was drinking with her colleagues and sister on Tuesday night at Valdevia Resort, where she worked.\n\nShe left the group to buy cigarettes, but never returned, and was found dead the next day with stab wounds on her neck and right eye, ABS-CBN reported.\n\nRemiendo\u2019s killing has since been condemned by the Commission of Human Rights (CHR) and various LGBT groups.\n\n\u201cThis incident reminds us all of the need to continue pushing for a more inclusive society that respects the rule of law and the dignity of everyone,\u201d CHR spokeswoman Jacqueline de Guia said in a statement today.\n\n\u201cWith the motive still unknown, we urge our police to ensure that there will be justice for her death,\u201d the CHR statement adds. \u201cNobody deserves to have their lives to be curtailed at a whim, let alone that the victim is part of the LGBTQIA+ community, a vulnerable sector of our society.\u201d\n\nRead: Celebrity hairdresser Ricky Reyes\u2019 anti-LGBTQ remarks get mixed reactions\n\nNoreen Barber, president of the United Pangasinan Association LGBTQ+, said they were shocked by the incident, as the trans community was \u201cwidely accepted\u201d in Pangasinan, where trans couples and their partners can walk safely in public.\n\nBarber, who claims to have known the victim personally from the province\u2019s tight-knit LGBTQ community, described the victim as kind. \u201cShe was family-oriented; I couldn\u2019t imagine it happening,\u201d she told Rappler\n\nThe University of the Philippines Babaylan, one of the biggest LGBTQ college organizations in the country, condemned Remiendo\u2019s killing, which they called a hate crime.\n\n\u201cThis only stresses the need for the immediate passage of the Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE) Equality Bill,\u201d they said. \u201cWe demand that our senators do their duty to protect our constitutionally-recognized rights as human beings, and finally pass into law one of the policies that will protect us from discrimination on the basis of our SOGIESC (sexual orientation, gender identity and expression and sex characteristics).\u201d\n\nThe government meanwhile, is still deliberating on passing the the SOGIE bill, which aims to protect the LGBTQ+ community against hate crimes and discrimination.\n\nThis article, Police identify suspects in brutal killing of trans woman in Pangasinan, originally appeared on Coconuts, Asia's leading alternative media company.
