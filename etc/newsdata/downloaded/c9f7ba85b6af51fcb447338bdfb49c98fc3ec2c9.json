A lot of low time frame volatility shaking people out of their positions. In contrast to that, the high time frames haven\u2019t really been that volatile. Just slowly bleeding out. Bulls need to close the daily above $8200 (black),\u201d he explained in a recent tweet,\n\n$BTC daily update: Still following the plan.\n\nA lot of low time frame volatility shaking people out of their positions.\n\nIn contrast to that, the high time frames haven't really been that volatile.\n\nJust slowly bleeding out.\n\nBulls need to close the daily above $8200 (black). pic.twitter.com/bfHTuzfg03 \u2014 DonAlt (@CryptoDonAlt) October 15, 2019\n\nBTC Technical Indicator Shows the Crypto is Caught in a Downtrend\n\nDonAlt is not alone in his bearish assessment of Bitcoin\u2019s short-term price action, as other analysts believe that the crypto will drop lower in the near-term before it finds meaningful support that allows it to climb higher.\n\nJosh McGruff, another popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, echoed a bearish sentiment in a recent tweet, explaining that he expects BTC to visit lows of $7,400 as multiple technical indicators are flipping bearish.\n\n\u201cWe dropped to 7600, didn\u2019t come as low as 7400 but I think we will still. OBV is in a clear downtrend now, would need to see that break up before I expect us to recover. 200EMA was broken and retested as resistance which rejected $BTC. Guppy is Bearish, Ichi Bearish,\u201d he explained.\n\nWe dropped to 7600, didn't come as low as 7400 but I think we will still.
