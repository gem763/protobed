The president\u2019s standing in the party in any poll is in the high 80s or low 90s. The rule changes reflect the strength of this standing.\u201d\n\nAt the 2016 Republican National Convention, a small but vocal group of Republicans sought to sabotage the proceedings and replace Trump on the ticket.
