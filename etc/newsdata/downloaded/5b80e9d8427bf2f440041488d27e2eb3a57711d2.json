If you spend $3,000 or more on a mattress at McIngvale\u2019s store and the Astros win the World Series, you will get a refund.\n\nAccording to KHOU-TV, McIngvale offered a similar deal when the Astros won the series over the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2017 and was forced to pay out more than $13 million in refunds. This year, insurance companies weren\u2019t giving McIngvale an acceptable rate to cover this year\u2019s promotion.\n\n\u201cAfter the [Zack Greinke trade], the Astros got real popular, so the insurance price went up,\u201d McIngvale told KHOU-TV. \u201cSo, we just hope a lot of customers come in and buy these mattresses because the best thing we can do is give away lots of mattresses to our customers if they win it all.\u201d\n\nHe told ESPN that Gallery Furniture\u2019s liability from the mattress promotion reached more than $15 million this week.\n\nMcIngvale wired the money to the casino on Monday and flew from Houston to Biloxi to place the bet, according to ESPN. The Astros were at +220 odds to win the World Series, which means the wager would pay McIngvale $7.7 million.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest bet in Mississippi history and one of the top few ever in the country. It stands out as unique. If we\u2019re not taking these bets, then who is?\u201d DraftKings co-founder and Chief Revenue Officer Matt Kalish told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. \u201cThat\u2019s what we do. When people are looking to make big bets in sports, we want to make sure we deliver.\u201d\n\nMcIngvale also placed a $200,000 bet on the Astros to win the World Series at South Point in Las Vegas at +250 odds and several other undisclosed bets at Caesars, MGM, Treasure Island and Circa Sports, according to ESPN.\n\nCLICK TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cI'm just amazed how much DraftKings and Scarlet Peal took, and they didn't blink an eye,\u201d McIngvale told ESPN. \u201cThat's pretty rare in the sports betting business in the United States for someone to take three and [a] half million dollars.\u201d\n\nThe Houston Astros had the best record in baseball this season with 107 wins and 55 losses. The team awaits the winner of the American League Wild Card game between the Oakland Athletics and the Tampa Bay Rays.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe Astros\u2019 first American League Division Series will begin Friday.", "description": "A Houston furniture salesman placed an interesting bet on the Houston Astros to win the World Series this month.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/MLB-Michael-Brantley.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
