Biden had earlier joined them and other candidates in swearing off donations during the primary season from corporate PACs or independent committees.\n\nBiden has said that he feels confident that he is raising enough money to run his campaign. His campaign on Thursday did not answer a question from Reuters about whether Biden would now accept super PAC help, instead releasing the statement from Bedingfield.\n\nTiffany Muller, president of the campaign finance reform group End Citizens United, unleashed a volley of criticism at Biden on Twitter, and in a statement sent to reporters.\n\n\"@StopBigMoney is calling on @JoeBiden to reconsider this decision and disavow single-candidate Super PACS supporting his candidacy,\" Muller wrote.\n\n\"Last month, @JoeBiden said he wouldn't embrace a single-candidate Super PAC,\" Muller added. \"Today, he broke that promise.\"\n\nBiden announced his candidacy in April, later than some rivals. The campaign has also abstained from accepting cash from federally registered lobbyists and certain corporate fundraising entities that are allowed raise unlimited sums of money.\n\nTrump, who has not sworn off super PAC donations, and his party jointly raised $125 million for his 2020 reelection bid in the third quarter, the Republican National Committee said.\n\nAfter a whistleblower complaint prompted Democrats to open an impeachment inquiry into whether Trump illegally asked Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter, the Republican has repeatedly criticized Biden.\n\nTrump's reelection campaign has also released ads targeting Biden and his son.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt and Sharon Bernstein, Additional reporting by Amanda Becker; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)", "description": "\"In this time of crisis in our politics, it is not surprising that those who are dedicated to defeating (President) Donald Trump are organizing in every way permitted by current law to bring an end to his disastrous presidency,\" Biden spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield said in an oblique reference", "authors": ["Trevor Hunnicutt", "Sharon Bernstein"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qF55Qg4Hn9L83iXDojqghA--~B/aD01Nzc7dz03OTk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/ef5f9977ef3e107f5abc58ac22bda885", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
