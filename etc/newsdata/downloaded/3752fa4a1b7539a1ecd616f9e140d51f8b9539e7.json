At the same time, sellers are accepting offers that are an average of 3.8%, or \u00a39,800 (US$12,617) lower than the initial asking price.\n\n\n\nUncertainty over Brexit is an issue in many regions of the U.K., but it\u2019s just one factor causing the slowdown.\n\nMore: Tech Wealth Gives Boost to Younger Buyers in Super-Prime London\n\n\u201cRemoving the uncertainty caused by Brexit will do little to address levels of housing affordability, which is limiting market activity across southern England,\u201d Richard Donnell, research and insight director at Zoopla, said in the report.\n\n\n\nStill, \u201conce the political outlook becomes clearer, we would expect a modest bounce-back in demand for a six- to 12-month period,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nIn London, homes are taking even longer to sell, spending an average of 14-and-a-half weeks on the market before finding a buyer. And homes in the capital are selling for an average of 5.7% below asking price, according to the report.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: An LVMH Takeover of Tiffany Could Expand the Global Reach of Little Blue Box\n\nThese figures differ between inner and outer London, the report stated. A home in inner London could take an average of 20 weeks to sell, at a 7.6% or \u00a349,824 discount, while a home on the outer fringes of the city sells in an average of 12.2 weeks for about 4.7% less than the asking price.\n\nHomes in the Midlands, in the center of the country, and the North of England, have fared better. About 75% of cities in these regions see homes sell in between 8.4 and 9.5 weeks, while only dropping asking prices 2% or 3%, the report found.\n\n\n\nThe market in Scotland is also strong. Homes in Glasgow and Edinburgh sell within an average of five to six weeks, the report found. Properties in those cities are also fetching an average of 6% to 7% above the asking price.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["V.L.
