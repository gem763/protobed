The standard answer is that people should be allowed to make bad choices about what they eat and drink. But that\u2019s a slippery defense when the consumers are children and the choices they face are loaded against their wellbeing, as Thursday\u2019s British government report on childhood obesity makes clear.\n\nThe snacks industry \u2014 from Mondelez International Inc. to Coca-Cola Co. and from Nestle SA to the Kraft Heinz Company \u2014 needs to rethink its purpose, and strategy, if its license to operate is to endure.\n\nFormer U.K. chief medical officer Professor Sally Davies, the report\u2019s author, cites multiple causes for a saddening rise in obesity among England\u2019s 10-11-year-olds since 1990. The giant food brands are only part of the problem but that hardly absolves them from leading the solution. As Davies says, cheap unhealthy food tends to be the most readily available. Portion inflation is rampant. Advertising or sponsorship is pervasive. Healthy options are often unaffordable for those on low incomes, while the unhealthy options are cheap.\n\nDavies\u2019s recommendations include some radical ideas. The U.K. public may be banned from eating and drinking on public transport. Industry faces calorie caps on food portions consumed \u201cout-of-home,\u201d tiered VAT on unhealthy food, plain packaging and the end of tax deductibility of marketing costs for unhealthy products. These may just be proposals. But the direction of travel is clear.\n\nThis is what happens when an industry fails to self-regulate to mitigate its worst effects. Governments wake up. The food and drink industry is a big employer and a big taxpayer. Even so, the economics favor intervention. The medical costs of obesity, coupled with lost productivity, are 3% of global GDP, according to McKinsey research from 2014. Today\u2019s unhealthy children are tomorrow\u2019s sick workforce.\n\nThe U.K. Food and Drink Federation, the lobby group, says \u201cpunitive action\u201d might hinder continuing the progress the manufacturers have already made in cutting salt, sugar and calories from their products over the last four years. It says the industry must \u201ctake the consumer with us.\u201d The question is whether it is taking itself and its customers to an early grave.\n\nThe industry needs to see this problem as an opportunity not a threat. First, it should be clear about its role in society. Making treats that people want to eat can be a good reason for a corporation to exist, but not when it adds to a public health crisis. This doesn\u2019t mean PepsiCo Inc. ending production of Doritos. But it does mean defining responsibly what the target market \u2014 and age group \u2014 is for such products. And it requires combining marketing with education.\n\nAt the same time, food manufacturers should redouble their efforts to innovate healthier, cost-effective alternatives to sugar and salt. This is a chance for the food giants to think about the huge market for healthy snacks. Food technology has a vital role here and it\u2019s best mediated by the private sector. R&D has already helped, as with the development of Nestle\u2019s so-called hollow sugar.\n\nThis week the OECD proposed reforms to corporate taxation, which would allow governments to tax digital companies that generate revenues in countries where they have no physical presence. The food industry faces a similar revenue challenge. Its products will be subject to extra taxes in certain markets until they start to use their well-funded research labs to help meet national health objectives.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear that the sector sees obesity as a strategic issue yet. Unilever NV is recycling plastic packaging but still aiming to sell lots more Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream. The debate among investors about what stocks to divest centers on fossil fuels right now. If food companies don\u2019t act, they\u2019ll join tobacco and oil in the sin bin.\n\n--With assistance from Lara Williams.\n\nTo contact the author of this story: Chris Hughes at chughes89@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.net\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nChris Hughes is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals.
