I think now 10 million people have watched the press conference.\n\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the global audience for this fight going to be? I don\u2019t know, in excessive of 50 million?\n\n\u201cIf we can retain 1% to the sport, then that\u2019s massive for the sport, but we\u2019ve got to work hard to do that. It\u2019s not going to be easy, I\u2019d like to retain 10%.\n\n\u201cIf we can showcase why we love the sport, Devin Haney, Billy Joe Saunders and show this new audience how great the sport is, then we\u2019ve got a chance.\u201d\n\nHearn went on to say that Olympic athletes are \u2018no longer role models\u2019 for the up and coming audiences, with YouTubers like KSI and Paul taking over.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t ignore this new world that we live in. Olympic athletes are no longer role models for the younger generation, Youtube stars are. As sad as it may seem, that\u2019s the truth, that\u2019s the world we live in.\n\n\u201cWe just need to face reality, embrace it and try and use that to keep growing boxing.\u201d", "description": "Matchroom\u00a0Boxing USA\u00a0promoter Eddie\u00a0Hearn\u00a0says that\u00a0KSI\u00a0vs Logan Paul II is a \u2018circus\u2019.
