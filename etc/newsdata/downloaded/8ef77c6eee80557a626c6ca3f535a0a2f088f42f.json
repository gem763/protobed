Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who has already proposed a wealth tax to raise funds for a variety of new government programs, on Thursday unveiled a plan to expand Social Security by creating two taxes on wage and investment income for wealthy Americans. \u2026Since the start of the year, much of the debate around taxes among Democrats has been over how much and how best to raise taxes on the rich. \u2026Democratic presidential candidates across the board have proposed ways to increase taxes on the rich. The developments have encouraged liberal groups pressing for higher taxes on the wealthy. \u2026Sanders, the Democratic presidential candidate and Vermont senator, has legislation to expand and extend the solvency of the retirement program that would subject all income above $250,000 to the Social Security payroll tax. Sanders\u2019s bill is co-sponsored in the Senate by two fellow presidential candidates, Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.).\n\nThese ideas would do considerable harm to the economy and reduce American competitiveness.\n\nBut let\u2019s focus on whether the left\u2019s tax agenda is capable of financing their spending wish lists.\n\nBrian Riedl of the Manhattan Institute just released his Book of Charts. There are dozens of sobering visuals, but here\u2019s the one that\u2019s relevant for today.\n\nThe bottom line is that our friends on the left have an enormous list of goodies they want to dispense, yet their proposed tax hikes (even assuming no Laffer Curve) would only pay for a fraction of their agenda.\n\nWhich is why lower-income and middle-class taxpayers need to realize that they\u2019re the ones with bulls-eyes on their back.\n\nJust like we\u2019ve seen on the other side of the Atlantic, there\u2019s no way to finance a European-sized welfare state with pillaging ordinary people. Especially since upper-income taxpayers can change their behavior to avoid most tax hikes.\n\nSo brace yourselves for a value-added tax, a carbon tax, a financial transactions tax, and higher payroll taxes.", "description": "I\u2019ve written many times about the\u00a0perverse and\u00a0destructive economic impact of .09/20/2019 18:37:50PM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
