Violent actions against civilian areas and infrastructure vital to the global economy only deepen conflict and mistrust. The United States Government is monitoring the situation and remains committed to ensuring global oil markets are stable and well supplied,\" White House Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere said in a statement, citing negative impacts on the U.S. and global economy.\n\nThe Department of Energy said in a statement that Sec. Rick Perry \u201cstands ready to deploy resources from the Strategic Petroleum Oil Reserves (SPRO) if necessary to offset any disruptions to oil markets as a result of this act of aggression.\u201d\n\nBin Salman said Saudi Arabia is \u201cwilling and able to confront and deal with this terrorist aggression,\u201d according to a news release from the Saudi Embassy in Washington.\n\nPompeo later Saturday blamed Iran for the attack, saying there was no evidence the drones used in the attack originated in Yemen.\n\n\"Tehran is behind nearly 100 attacks on Saudi Arabia while Rouhani and Zarif pretend to engage in diplomacy. Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply. There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen,\" Pompeo wrote on Twitter.\n\n\"We call on all nations to publicly and unequivocally condemn Iran\u2019s attacks. The United States will work with our partners and allies to ensure that energy markets remain well supplied and Iran is held accountable for its aggression,\" Pompeo continued.\n\nBut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, denounced Pompeo's characterization of the actors involved in the attack.\n\n\"This is such irresponsible simplification and it\u2019s how we get into dumb wars of choice. The Saudis and Houthis are at war. The Saudis attack the Houthis and the Houthis attack back. Iran is backing the Houthis and has been a bad actor, but it\u2019s just not as simple as Houthis=Iran,\" Murphy wrote.\n\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a foreign policy hawk and Trump ally, said the attack is \"another example of how Iran is wreaking havoc in the Middle East,\" and called for retribution against Iran.\n\n\"It is now time for the U.S. to put on the table an attack on Iranian oil refineries if they continue their provocations or increase nuclear enrichment,\" Graham wrote. \"Iran will not stop their misbehavior until the consequences become more real, like attacking their refineries, which will break the regime\u2019s back.\"\n\nState-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco describes its Abqaiq oil processing facility in Buqyaq as \u201cthe largest crude oil stabilization plant in the world,\u201d according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe attack by the Houthis in the ongoing war against a Saudi-led coalition comes after repeated drone assaults on the kingdom\u2019s oil infrastructure, heightening existing tensions between the U.S. and Iran.\n\nThe attacks also come a week after Trump said he was open to meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at the upcoming U.N. General Assembly in New York.", "description": "The attack comes after weeks of similar drone assaults on the kingdom\u2019s oil infrastructure.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eApLINbo70Lr8AtgLe6ERA--~B/aD03NzM7dz0xMTYwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/politico_453/bef7685e277310548c349426413a22cf", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
