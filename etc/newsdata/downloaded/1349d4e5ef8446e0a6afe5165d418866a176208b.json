Fat chance!", "language": "en", "text": "Who Are You Calling Fat?\n\nRating:\n\nThe Mountain\n\nRating:\n\nEveryone is searching frantically for new ways of being offended these days. But a loud-mouthed activist called Victoria took her hurt feelings to a new height of self-indulgence, on the discussion show Who Are You Calling Fat? (BBC2).\n\nSteaming from the ears, she insisted the term \u2018obese\u2019 and \u2018overweight\u2019 should never be printed in full.\n\nThe self-proclaimed \u2018body positive\u2019 therapist labelled them \u2018the O-words\u2019 and declared they were too offensive to be written without asterisks.\n\nA loud-mouthed activist called Victoria took her hurt feelings to a new height of self-indulgence, on the discussion show Who Are You Calling Fat? (BBC2). Steaming from the ears, she insisted the term \u2018obese\u2019 and \u2018overweight\u2019 should never be printed in full\n\nAnything\u2019s offensive if you try hard enough. Pretty soon, if the likes of Victoria get their way, the folk of North Piddle in Worcestershire will have to use a bleeper when they spell out their addresses.\n\nWhen BBC execs sent nine larger-than-average people to live together, some of them morbidly O-word and others just well-covered, they were hoping to churn up lots of confrontations, tearful recriminations, insults and meltdowns. They weren\u2019t disappointed.\n\nThis is television\u2019s new favourite format for addressing controversial topics. Studio debates and audience questions are seen as an outmoded way to stage discussions.\n\nThere was one great gag, though, from stand-up comedian Jed, a big lad himself (above): \u2018I could go to the doctor with a bullet wound, and he\u2019d say: \u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re fat... if you were skinny, they probably would have missed you!\u201d\n\nNow, everyone piles into a house to be filmed as tempers fray. It used to be called Big Brother but these days, as the housemates sneak into the garden for a gossip or blub with self-pity in the kitchen, we\u2019re expected to take their conversations seriously.\n\nIt was hard to give any credence to their arguments when half the household decided to \u2018challenge stereotypes\u2019 by standing in the middle of a shopping precinct in their swimming costumes and inviting passers-by to write inspirational messages on their bodies.\n\nThe show took a grim turn when former nightclub owner Colin dropped in to show off his prosthetic leg.\n\nHe had an amputation after years of Type 2 diabetes: he broke a bone in his foot and gangrene set in.\n\nOnce a big eater, smoker and heavy drinker, Colin was so unhealthy that his surgeon feared he wouldn\u2019t survive a general anaesthetic \u2014 so the limb was removed while he was fully conscious, with just local pain relief.\n\nIt was hard to give any credence to their arguments when half the household decided to \u2018challenge stereotypes\u2019 by standing in the middle of a shopping precinct in their swimming costumes and inviting passers-by to write inspirational messages on their bodies\n\nYou\u2019d think a horror story like that would make anyone look at lettuce in a new light, but three of the housemates dismissed it as scaremongering and \u2018body shaming\u2019. At that point, it was hard to sustain much sympathy.\n\nThere was one great gag, though, from stand-up comedian Jed, a big lad himself: \u2018I could go to the doctor with a bullet wound, and he\u2019d say: \u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re fat... if you were skinny, they probably would have missed you!\u201d\u2019\n\nA brisk walk and some mountain air would be any doctor\u2019s advice for the ov*rwe*ght, and The Mountain (ITV) supplied plenty of that.\n\nThis four-part series offers a look at Snowdon across the four seasons, through the eyes of farmers, mountain rescuers, railway workers and Alwena, the lovely lady who runs the cafe halfway up the mountainside.\n\nSome of the locals found perpetual awe in their surroundings. Poet Viv loved to swim in the clear mountain lakes, where the water was so cold she could feel it in her marrowbone.\n\nOthers, such as sheep farmer Joe, were more blas\u00e9. He\u2019d never been to the summit itself: \u2018What\u2019s the point when you see it every day?\u2019\n\nMore than half a million visitors a year would disagree with him. Mind you, a lot of them probably get no further than Alwena\u2019s cafe.\n\nUnhappy chappy of the night:\n\nVisiting Bergen in Norway on Travel Man (C4), guest Lou Sanders loved the mountain zipwire.\n\n\u2018I feel like a seagull,\u2019 she whooped. Host Richard Ayoade, who is soon to leave the show, descended in grim silence. He\u2019s really not going to miss this job.", "description": "CHRISTOPHER STEVENS: A loud-mouthed activist called Victoria took her hurt feelings to a new height of self-indulgence, on the discussion show Who Are You Calling Fat?
