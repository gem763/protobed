The Bears ended up missing 44 tackles as Manu Samoa, fresh in their first game of the tournament, made 11 breaks and ran free in the second half where they scored five of their six tries.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a physical deterioration, it was mental,\u201d Russia coach Lyn Jones said.\n\nSamoa drew the first points attacking from a lineout. Fullback Tim Nanai-Williams gave an overlap to right wing Alapati Leiua who stepped the cover and was in.\n\nBut Russia came back with penalties by flyhalf Yuri Kushnarev to lead 6-5, and Samoa reacted badly.\n\nIn a two-minute span, center Rey Lee-Lo and hooker Motu Matu\u2019u were sin-binned for shoulder-led hits at the head of Russia fullback and captain Vasily Artemyev. They weren\u2019t red cards from French referee Romain Poite because both times Artemyev ducked down to brace for impacts.\n\nSamoa coach Steve Jackson said the problem wasn\u2019t discipline but tackle technique.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t learn from last weekend with people being cited,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be better in that area.\u201d\n\nRussia couldn\u2019t make the two-man advantage pay, being forced back into its own half. Not until right near halftime, when Samoa had 14 men, did Russia threaten, and only after Nanai-Williams spilled a high ball inside his 22 to put his team under pressure.\n\nFlyhalf Tusi Pisi was charged down by Vladimir Ostroushko and the ball fell in goal about a foot in front of his despairing dive. Pisi then had to make a try-saving tackle on lock Bogdan Fedotko, who spilled the ball within touching distance of the tryline.\n\nRussia, playing a Pacific Island side for the first time, incredibly led into halftime, but the lead evaporated within five minutes of the interval.\n\nA sweeping move full of offloads put Samoa No. 8 Afaesetiti Amosa over the line, but only after he was hooked around the neck by Russia prop Kirill Gotovtseva. Amosa twisted his right knee and had to be carried off without seeing Gotovtseva issued a yellow card.\n\nSamoa had the lead back at 10-6, though it would have been more if Pisi, Samoa\u2019s oldest World Cup player at 37, was more accurate off the tee.\n\nKushnarev showed him how with a cool dropped goal to cut the deficit to one, but Russia was 14 men down and flagging and Samoa was energized by more fresh legs off the bench.\n\nA no-look pass by replacement hooker Ray Niuia put winger Ed Fidow through the defense and around behind the posts to give Pisi an easier shot at goal.\n\nThen just four minutes later, Fidow\u2019s second try - and 10th in nine tests - earned Samoa a bonus thanks to an overlap pass from Leiua.\n\nLee-Lo scored the fifth try from a lineout attack with the final pass from Pisi, and after holding out a sustained 10-minute attack from the Russians, Samoa rubbed it in with a sixth try from a scrum on halfway. Leiua fended off one defender and high-stepped out of another to score his second try, and Pisi landed his second goalkick from seven attempts.\n\nBoth teams travel to Kobe. Samoa plays Scotland on Monday, while Russia has a nine-day break before facing Ireland.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Samoa accounted for Russia 34-9 in an incident-packed Rugby World Cup match that featured three yellow cards that could easily have been red.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Foster Niumata"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/24/aptopix_japan_rugby_wcup_russia_samoa_30481_c0-100-3820-2327_s1770x1032.jpg?5562595db85f06a656f7c70c0c8944be82cce6e1", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
