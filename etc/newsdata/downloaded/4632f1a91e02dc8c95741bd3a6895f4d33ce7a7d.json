The new target represents 15 per cent of all Phd students enrolled at the university.\n\nDeputy vice chancellor, research, Jim McCluskey said the German higher-education system is very strong, underpinned by government spending on R &D of 3 per cent of GDP, compared to 1.9 per cent in Australia.\n\nHe said about 45 per cent of Melbourne University's research is in medicine, so the German PhDs will focus on public health, immunology, bio and clinical medicine as well as engineering, physical sciences and humanities.\n\n\"Germany is without question the heart of Europe. Europe is much bigger than it used to be. It has ties with the middle east and Africa. We see Germany as the front door to Europe,\" professor McCluskey said.\n\n\"Germans are enchanted by Australia, they speak fabulous English and at the level of post graduate science English is the language of business.", "description": "One of Australia's highest ranked universities is rapidly expanding its research connections in Europe.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2522%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_93/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/30a0ccf0ebea0d224924efa944ecae31daf07913", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
