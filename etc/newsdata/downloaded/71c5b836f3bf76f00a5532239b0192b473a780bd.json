You can now download the Coinbase Pro mobile app on iOS \u2014 the Android version is coming soon.\n\nCoinbase Pro is the company\u2019s exchange that lets you set up advanced order types, such as limit orders. Those are fairly standard features for a cryptocurrency exchange. But Coinbase set up a separate \u201cpro\u201d platform so that the main Coinbase.com exchange remains as simple and straightforward as possible.\n\nAnd now, you can also use Coinbase Pro on your phone. I\u2019ve been playing around with the app, and it features everything you\u2019d expect. On the first tab, you can see a list of trading pairs.\n\nIf you tap on a pair, you can see real-time candles, the order book, your active orders as well as trade history for this specific pair. You can also set up an order to buy and sell cryptocurrencies from each trading pair page.\n\nOn the second tab, you can see your portfolio of crypto assets and its value in fiat currencies. You can deposit or withdraw cryptocurrencies from the mobile app. Unfortunately, if you want to deposit or withdraw fiat currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.), the app tells you to head over to the website.\n\nFinally, you can see your past and active orders, check your fees and limits.\n\nCoinbase increased some of its trading fees on Coinbase Pro for low-volume accounts just last week. It is now more expensive to trade on Coinbase Pro if you trade less than the equivalent of $50,000 over 30 days. And if you trade less than $10,000 over 30 days, it now costs 0.50% in maker and taker fees.\n\nKraken charges 0.26% in taker fees if you trade less $50,000 in the past 30 days. Binance charges 0.1% in trading fees. With those new trading fees, it feels like Coinbase is indeed targeting pro users with Coinbase Pro.\n\nDisclosure: I own small amounts of various cryptocurrencies.", "description": "Cryptocurrency exchange company Coinbase is launching a mobile app for its advanced users today.
