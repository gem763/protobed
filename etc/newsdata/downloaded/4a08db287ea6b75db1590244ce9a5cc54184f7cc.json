Previously, the portal only included guides for checking the firmware/OS integrity of various Cisco gear.\n\nThe only major software line for which Cisco did not release an incident response guide is Cisco IOS XR, the software that runs on carrier-grade routers.\n\nThe security guides might come in handy for a lot of folks, especially since Cisco has recently patched a series of critical security flaws impacting IOS XE routers and its popular line of Small Business 220 Series smart switches, both considered easy to exploit and bound to come under attack.\n\nIn similar news, a week before, on August 22, Cisco's Talos security team open-sourced 4CAN, a tool for finding security flaws in on-board car computers.", "description": "Forensic investigation guides available for Cisco ASA, IOS, IOS XE, and FTD gear.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/07/e23f10ff-1894-45a1-b32a-b16b6d951c8a/thumbnail/770x578/ca814d9829abfd51fc208d092e444d78/cisco.png"}
