This morning, I added a new step: spend 15 minutes scrolling through Twitter to see whether anyone had synced that delicious footage of President Trump\u2019s face falling on Sunday \u2014 as the World Series crowd is booing him \u2014 with the R.E.M. song \u201cEverybody Hurts.\u201d\n\nI watched the video over and over, scrutinizing every second of the footage, waiting for the exact moment when Mr. Trump\u2019s smirky grin gives way to stony petulance, the precise instant when he realizes that this sea of red-hatted Americans are not his red-hatted Americans, as the applause for veterans gives way to lusty boos, and the chants of \u201cLock him up!\u201d ripple through the stadium.\n\nIt felt like medicine, like balm for a weary soul. It wasn\u2019t until I\u2019d watched the footage sped up, slowed down and from six angles and heard myself crooning, \u201cLet me taste your tears!\u201d that I started feeling a little sick, as if I\u2019d gorged on Halloween candy.\n\nI realized that I was gloating. It was not a pleasant realization.\n\nThe booing itself wasn\u2019t the problem. The booing was appropriate. The booing was necessary, insofar as his trip to Nationals Park was one of the few times Mr. Trump has crept out of his self-made bubble and encountered something resembling the real world. When he eats out, it\u2019s in a restaurant in a hotel he owns; when he plays golf, it\u2019s at a club he owns; when he\u2019s with a crowd, it\u2019s his crowd.", "description": "When he goes low, Democrats are supposed to go high.
