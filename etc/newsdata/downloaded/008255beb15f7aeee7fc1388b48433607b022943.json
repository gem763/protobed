Until now Greensill specialised in providing small and medium-sized businesses with access to so-called working capital finance to run their day-to-day operations.\n\nSoftBank has taken control of WeWork after it emerged it was running out of cash and unable to float on the stock market\n\nThis means offering early payment to cover invoices due to be paid at a later date by large companies and Government agencies, including Vodafone and the NHS.\n\nThe digital finance house charges the businesses seeking early payment a fee of about 1 per cent of the sum provided. Then Greensill is paid in full by the suppliers\u2019 customers when invoices are settled.With this latest investment, Greensill plans to branch out to offering early payment to employees of companies \u2013 putting it in direct competition with payday lenders.\n\nHowever, Greensill is not planning to offer loans. The company is merely looking at advancing workers\u2019 wages that have already been earned and the employees will not be charged for early payment.\n\nQuickQuid collapsed into administration after being hit by thousands of complaints\n\nThe move comes at a tough time for the payday lending industry, which has come under pressure for its controversial practices.\n\nOn Friday the UK\u2019s largest payday lender, QuickQuid, collapsed into administration after being hit by thousands of complaints.\n\nCustomers complained they had been given loans they could not afford to repay. More than a million customers were left facing uncertainty over whether their claims for compensation would be paid.\n\nIts exit from Britain follows the collapse of Wonga last year. The Money Shop went under in June after facing complaints.\n\nPayday lenders have been hit by a crackdown that forced them to conduct affordability checks and cap charges to stop customers paying back more in fees and interest than the sum they initially borrowed.", "description": "City sources said Greensill is in advanced talks to buy FreeUp, a technology company that should enable the firm to offer ordinary workers early payment of their wages.", "authors": ["Ben Harrington For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
