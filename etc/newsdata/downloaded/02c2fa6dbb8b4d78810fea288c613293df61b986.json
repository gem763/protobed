It says that the president's lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, \"is a central figure in this effort. Attorney General [William] Barr appears to be as well.\"\n\nThe complaint centers on Trump's July 25 call with the president of Ukraine, an account of which was released on Wednesday by the White House.\n\nAfter the call, according to the whistleblower, \"senior White House officials had intervened to lock down all records of the phone call,\" which the whistleblower says \"underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call.\"\n\nThe whistleblower said this \"was not the first time\" that a presidential transcript was placed into a \"codeword-level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive \u2014 rather than national security sensitive \u2014 information.\"\n\nTranslation: White House officials handled materials related to the call differently from the way they usually do, adding additional security to restrict the circle of people who might be able to view them.\n\nThat is likely to raise questions about just what other information might be so protected relating to Trump's other conversations with foreign leaders.\n\nThe whistleblower says during the call, Trump \"sought to pressure the Ukrainian leader to take actions to help the president's 2020 reelection bid.\"\n\nThe White House memorandum of the call shows that Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for \"a favor\" \u2014 to investigate political rival and former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe White House issued a statement on Thursday calling this situation unremarkable.\n\n\"Nothing has changed with the release of this complaint, which is nothing more than a collection of third-hand accounts of events and cobbled-together press clippings \u2014 all of which shows nothing improper,\" the statement said.\n\nAt least one Republican lawmaker disagrees. Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, who is not running for reelection next year, wrote this on Twitter:\n\n\"There is a lot in the whistleblower complaint that is concerning. We need to fully investigate all of the allegations addressed in the letter, and the first step is to talk to the whistleblower.\"\n\nAlthough the House and Senate intelligence committees are negotiating with an attorney for the person, whose identity remains unknown, it isn't clear when Congress may talk with the person.\n\nThe whistleblower says \"multiple officials told me\" that Ukrainian leadership was led to believe that a meeting or phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy would be contingent on whether he \"showed willingness to \"play ball.\"", "description": "The complaint, released by the House intelligence committee, details accounts by White House officials about a phone call they treated differently from others, but perhaps not for the first time.", "authors": ["Brian Naylor"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/26/gettyimages-1171050575_wide-77456fa13c29cceae29f98e5fba1acff36903c74.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
