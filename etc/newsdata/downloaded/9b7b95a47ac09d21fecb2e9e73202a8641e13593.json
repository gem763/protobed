Standefer and Alesch \u2014 who in 2002 founded the New York-based design studio Roman and Williams (perhaps best known for the now much-imitated look it created for Ace Hotel, all antique wingback chairs and industrial brass light fixtures, midcentury end tables and oak-paneled walls) \u2014 bought this property over a decade ago and have since encouraged the grass to run luxuriantly amok. It is neither mowed nor neglected but rather nurtured each fall with an intensive regimen of organic fertilizer. \u201cI want it long,\u201d Standefer says.\n\n[Sign up here for the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors are noticing and coveting now.]\n\nYou can infer from this process much about the couple\u2019s gardening philosophy. Champions of meadowlike borders and picturesque weeds, they hew closely to the 20th-century English poet, novelist and garden designer Vita Sackville-West\u2019s ideal of \u201csweet disorder\u201d that is nevertheless \u201cjudiciously arranged,\u201d as she wrote in 1958. The couple\u2019s knee-high field of white cosmos is trimmed to a clean edge where it meets the swaying grass; empty oyster shells, cast off from summer barbecues, litter a pristine crushed-seashell pebble path. Both in their professional practice and in their own homes, they prioritize the textured and timeworn above the refined or precious. As we walk across the lawn, which bounces pleasantly underfoot, Alesch bends down to pet it.", "description": "At their weekend home on the outer edge of Long Island, the designers behind the firm Roman and Williams let nature lead.", "authors": ["Alice Newell-Hanson"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/16/t-magazine/16tmag-romanandwilliams/16tmag-romanandwilliams-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
