Five questions for the ECB", "language": "en", "text": "LONDON, (Reuters) - Mario Draghi\u2019s last meeting as European Central Bank chief this Thursday may prove a lively gathering given a deep rift among policymakers over renewed asset purchases that threatens the effectiveness of policy.\n\nFILE PHOTO: European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi speaks at the Academy of Athens during his visit in Athens, Greece, October 1, 2019. REUTERS/Costas Baltas\n\nAfter unleashing a wave of stimulus measures in September \u2014 including an interest-rate cut and a decision to restart asset purchases to boost the economy \u2014 no major announcements are anticipated.\n\n\u201cThe biggest part of the meeting will be the farewell to Draghi,\u201d said Pictet Wealth Management strategist Frederik Ducrozet. \u201cThis could be an emotional moment for him.\u201d\n\nAt the same time deep divisions have emerged among policymakers over reviving bond purchases, meaning the ECB chief\u2019s final news conference may prove a heated affair.\n\nHere are five key questions for markets.\n\n1. So, will the ECB do anything this week?\n\nEconomists predict no major changes to the ECB\u2019s post-meeting policy statement given a broad range of stimulus measures unveiled at the Sept. 12 meeting. (Full Story)\n\nThey said technical issues regarding the restart of quantitative easing (QE) and the tiering of interest rates may be on the agenda.\n\nSome expected Thursday\u2019s meeting to be a largely ceremonial one to mark the end of Draghi\u2019s eight-year term, which concludes on Oct. 31.\n\nBut the ECB is also likely to be asked about the impact of its last policy measures given low inflation expectations and concern that the central bank is running out of firepower.\n\nThe latest stimulus package will not significantly help bring inflation back to target, according to a Reuters poll of economists who said the risk of a euro zone recession in the next two years has increased.\n\nGraphic: ECB's Sept meeting measures, here\n\n2. The ECB\u2019s board is deeply divided, what does this mean for policy?\n\nDraghi is likely to be pressed about the rift within the ECB Governing Council although economists say this is now an issue for his successor Christine Lagarde.\n\nAn unprecedented split, which saw more than a third of policymakers including the central bank chiefs of France and Germany oppose the new bond purchases, threatens the effectiveness of ECB monetary policy.\n\nFor markets, the divisions have added to a perception that the ECB\u2019s room for maneuver is limited. But senior officials such as Vice President Luis de Guindos have ruled out a policy U-turn and Draghi is likely to do the same.\n\n\u201cFrom Draghi\u2019s point of view, he will say the discussions are important and there are differences but as long as there is a majority in favor, those policies are carried out,\u201d said Anatoli Annenkov, senior European economist at Societe Generale.\n\n\u201cWhat is more important is the take of the next ECB president on the divisions but we\u2019ll have to wait for her to take office to know that.\u201d\n\nTable below from Pictet Wealth Management.\n\nGraphic: ECB doves vs hawks , here\n\n3. What about QE, could we get more details?\n\nThe ECB will restart QE in November with 20 billion euros of asset purchases a month. It may reiterate on Thursday that the scheme is likely to be broadly in line with the previous round, in which government bonds made up the bulk of purchases.\n\nA question about QE is nevertheless likely to come up at the news conference, given the central bank has pledged open-ended asset purchases but may find this difficult to do without tweaks to its own rules on what it can own.\n\nTwo sources familiar with the process told Reuters the ECB will run out of German bonds to buy in just over a year under the current rules and would have to bend them to keep the scheme running longer, risking fresh internal and legal conflict.\n\nGraphic: ECB's QE programme , here\n\n4. Could the ECB clarify its plans for tiering?\n\nAt its September meeting, the ECB increased its charge on bank deposits to -0.5% to protect the euro zone from a global economic slowdown. But it also granted an exemption from that charge on any deposit exceeding six times a bank\u2019s mandatory reserves through a so-called tiered rate on deposits.\n\nThat has resulted in banks raising the rate at which they lend to each other over several months, anticipating that some cash will be withdrawn from the market and parked at the ECB when the new rate takes effect on Oct. 30.\n\nIf this persists, the ECB may have to reduce the amount of reserves subject to the exemption to prevent a rise in borrowing costs in the economy.\n\nWhile tweaks to the policy are not anticipated prior to the launch, investors are looking for the ECB to perhaps clarify its intentions.\n\nIn bond markets, the tiering policy has been interpreted as inadvertent monetary tightening, dampening expectations for further rate cuts.\n\nWhile many economists expect a December ECB rate reduction, money markets do not price in even a slim chance of 10 basis point cut ECBWATCH before 2020.\n\nGraphic: Euro zone money markets , here\n\n5. What will be the message from Draghi as his term draws to en end?\n\nDraghi, who has steered the ECB through the euro zone debt crisis and the uncharted waters of QE, has ramped up his call on governments to use fiscal policy to boost the bloc\u2019s long-term growth and inflation prospects.\n\nMember states can help the ECB raise interest rates sooner if they loosen their own purse strings to support the economy, he said earlier this month.\n\nThis message may be repeated on Thursday but more likely, say analysts, the ECB chief will want to end his news conference on a positive note.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately Draghi won\u2019t have a track record on inflation, but he does have one on employment growth,\u201d said Societe Generale\u2019s Annenkov. \u201cHis sign-off message is likely to be that things would have been much worse had the ECB done less.\u201d\n\nGraphic: Inflation, unemployment during the Draghi era , here", "description": "Mario Draghi's last meeting as European Central Bank chief this Thursday may prove a lively gathering given a deep rift among policymakers over renewed asset purchases that threatens the effectiveness of policy.", "authors": ["Dhara Ranasinghe", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443242345&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0BW", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
