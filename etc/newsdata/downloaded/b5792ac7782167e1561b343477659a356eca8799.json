Report from centre of Typhoon Hagibis", "language": "en", "text": "As early as 9.30am local time \u2014 12 hours before Typhoon Hagibis was due to strike \u2014 storm clouds from the Pacific Ocean were already ripping past my bedroom windows high up on the 62nd floor.\n\nIn my room of the Royal Park Hotel, where the team of hosts Japan are staying, news bulletins flashed up on the TV showing images of the early devastation across the country.\n\nForecasters were warning to prepare for the biggest storm of its kind this century, with wind speeds on the East Coast reaching 140mph.\n\nSportsmail's Nik Simon reports from the centre of the huge storm that has rocked World Cup\n\nSurging waves generated by typhoon Hagibis hit the seashore in Mihama\n\nA tornado formed during the course of the Typhoon Hagibis hit Chiba Prefecture near Tokyo\n\nJapan's players were forced to wade through a flooded tunnel at Yokohama Stadium\n\nThere was footage of roofs being stripped off houses, cars being flipped over, submerged vehicles, violent floods, trapped residents and reports of the first death 50 miles to the east in Chiba. A reminder that, in the eye of the storm, there was more at risk than the integrity of the World Cup.\n\nOver in Tokyo, just 20 miles away, a friend called to tell me a letter had appeared under the door of their room at their ANA Intercontinental Hotel. It was supposed to reassure guests, but one line stood out: 'Our hotel was designed to move during strong winds so you may notice some related noise,' it read. 'Please do not be alarmed as this is completely normal.'\n\nBefore the worst of the typhoon arrived, the Brave Blossoms, as Japan are known, held their captain's run \u2014 ahead of Sunday's under-threat match against Scotland \u2014 at the Chichibunomiya Stadium in Tokyo. Parts of the ground were already under water and players had to walk through knee-deep flooding just to reach the pitch. The worst of the weather was yet to come.\n\nSandbags were placed at the entrance of buildings around Yokohama Bay to protect them from damage, while local businessmen tied up their shop-front hoardings with ropes to hold them together against the gales.\n\n'Biggest typhoon for 50 years. Fast. Strong. Dangerous. Stay inside,' said the hotel porter, wearing a trench coat and wellington boots, when I ventured down to the lobby to look outside.\n\nCars sit submerged in water in the residential area hit by Typhoon Hagibis, in Ise, central Japan\n\nThe Tama River has swelled during Typhoon Hagibis in Tokyo on Saturday\n\nThere were warnings of flooding, of landslides, of disruption to transport as high waves formed\n\nPedestrians use umbrellas to shield themselves from the rain as they walk along a street\n\nTyphoon Hagibis injured five people in Chiba, according to Chiba's prefectural government\n\nThe tornado also destroyed a house and damaged at least nine others\n\nAll forms of public transport were shut down and the shops, most of which closed up on Friday night, were stripped bare as customers stocked up on food and drink supplies before last orders. On the newsstands, satellite pictures of the typhoon were splashed across the front of the papers.\n\nBack in my room, a strange creaking sound could be heard as I looked out of the windows. It was the building moving. The worst part of the storm was still to arrive.\n\nEmergency evacuation alerts flashed up on my mobile, and on the news I could now see locals taking cover in schools and leisure centres. Across the country, more than one million people were put under an evacuation orders as households were hit by widespread power cuts. Nearby rivers doubled in size and flooding occurred around the confines of the Yokohama Stadium, which is due to host today's match if it passes inspections this morning.\n\nA few miles across town, Scotland were marooned in the Sheraton Hotel. Refusing to give up hope of today's game going ahead, they ran through training drills in the ball room of their luxury base. 'Ryan Wilson has been keeping us entertained with his typhoon knowledge,' said full-back Stuart Hogg. Back in the Royal Park Hotel, Japan's players took refuge in the exposed confines of their team-room on the 70th floor. Their English analyst, Andrew Watts, who I interviewed as the wind picked up outside, explained how the players were used to such conditions.\n\n'Most of the boys will be spending time on computers looking at their opposite Scotland number,' he said. 'They work harder than any other nation. If they want to chill out, they'll chill out.'\n\nRivers are swollen and some have burst the banks, with the worst storm in 60 years closing in\n\nStreets are quiet and residents have been advised against leaving their homes\n\nTyphoon Hagibis is already causing havoc in some areas but the worst is still yet to hit Japan\n\nPublic transport and general infrastructure has been completely thrown by the weather\n\nFlooding in the Tokyo suburb of Hachioji has overwhelmed the drainage system, causing it to gush out onto the street.#Hagibis #Typhoon\n\nClick here for more updates:https://t.co/xZHPRNU5fb \u2026 pic.twitter.com/mHRtKg56TZ \u2014 NHK WORLD News (@NHKWORLD_News) October 12, 2019\n\nA magnitude 5.7 earthquake occurred offshore South Eastern Chiba Prefecture (cross)\n\nOn the way up in the lift, I met one of Japan's players. He'd had a phonecall from his wife, who was staying in a hotel a couple of blocks away, to say they had ran out of food supplies. He filled a bag with pork bao buns and chicken skewers to take over, before returning to watch Ireland versus Samoa.\n\nBut shortly before kick-off, at about 6.30pm, the hotel began to shake across all 70 floors, as an earthquake measuring 5.7 on the Richter Scale struck before the typhoon. Hotel staff assured guests of the building's structural safety \u2014 and rugby fans from rival nations showed bunker spirit as they gathered in the lobby to make plans to watch the night's match together on a laptop.\n\nThe storm eventually arrived, battering the building which swayed and creaked like a cruise liner for almost three hours. Outside there was the sound of rain hammering against the windows and a hurricane-force wind howling across the rooftops.\n\nThe storm was expected to continue until 2am, but it moved on to its next victim three hours ahead of schedule, which can only bode well for today's Test. Japan, they say, is an expert at getting back on its feet and, before long, the first cars braved the roads.\n\nA trail of collateral damage was left in the storm's track \u2014 a blazing fire could be seen from the 62nd floor in a shipyard 15 miles south \u2014 and World Cup organisers were left with a race against time.", "description": "NIK SIMON IN YOKAHAMA: In my room of the Royal Park Hotel, where the team of hosts Japan are staying, news bulletins flashed up on the TV showing images of the early devastation.", "authors": ["Nik Simon For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/21/19636484-0-image-a-9_1570913717111.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
