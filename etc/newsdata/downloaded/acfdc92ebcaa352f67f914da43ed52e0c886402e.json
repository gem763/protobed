It\u2019s made $849 million globally, including $47.8 million internationally over the weekend. (Mel Gibson\u2019s \u201cThe Passion of the Christ\u201d remains the R-rated domestic leader, with $370.8 million.)\n\nDespite mixed reviews, \u201cJoker\u201d \u2014 a \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d-styled spin on a comic-book origin story \u2014 has already amassed a box-office total exceeding that of more mainstream superhero movies such as \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d and \u201cWonder Woman.\u201d\n\nNo new releases mustered any competition with the holdovers. The best-performing newcomer was the STX Entertainment horror thriller \u201cCountdown.\u201d It grossed $9 million. Sony Screen Gems\u2019 \u201cBlack and Blue,\u201d a police thriller starring Naomie Harris, opened with $8.3 million.\n\nHolding especially well was \u201cThe Addams Family,\u201d United Artists and MGM\u2019s Halloween-timed animated reboot of the macabre family. It slid just 28% in its second weekend with $11.7 million, good for third place\n\nMuch of the weekend\u2019s action was in limited or expanding releases for acclaimed Oscar contenders.\n\nRobert Eggers\u2019 \u201cThe Lighthouse,\u201d a black-and-white psychological drama starring Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson as 19th century lighthouse keepers, made $3 million on just 586 screens for A24.\n\nTaika Waititi\u2019s \u201cJojo Rabbit,\u201d about a 10-year-old boy growing up in Nazi Germany, expanded into 55 theaters, earning a strong $1 million. In September, the Fox Searchlight release won the Toronto Film Festival\u2019s highly predictive audience award , setting it up as a potential Academy Awards favorite. Its initial expansion suggests it will be a hit with audiences, too.\n\nLess successful was the Bruce Springsteen concert film \u201cWestern Stars\u201d ($560,000 in 537 theaters).\n\nAlfonso Gomez-Rejon\u2019s \u201cThe Current War\u201d also finally landed in theaters more than two years after it first premiered. Gomez-Rejon recut his film after Harvey Weinstein, shortly before his downfall, pushed out a critically panned version of the Thomas Edison (Benedict Cumberbatch) and George Westinghouse (Michael Shannon) tale. Gomez-Rejon\u2019s \u201cdirector\u2019s cut,\u201d which 101 Studios acquired from the now-defunct Weinstein Co., opened with $2.7 million from about 1,000 theaters.\n\n\u201cTerminator: Dark Fate,\u201d which is expected to lead the box office next weekend, got off to a $12.8 million start in a handful of international markets before its stateside debut.\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.", "description": "\"Joker,\" Todd Phillip\u2019s R-rated comic-book hit, regained the top spot at the weekend box office, besting \u201cMaleficent: Mistress of Evil.\u201d", "authors": ["Breitbart News"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/jokerBO1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
