(Picture: National Centre for Reptile Welfare)\n\nA bearded dragon who is constantly being overlooked by potential new owners due to her \u2018ugly\u2019 appearance is looking for a forever home.\n\nThe National Centre for Reptile Welfare has launched a campaign alongside Support Adoption For Pets, to find new owners to come forward and adopt little Stumpy.\n\nWhen Stumpy was just two years old, her tail was amputated due to an incurable infection, following an injury.\n\nStumpy arrived at the rescue centre 143 days ago, after her previous owner was no longer able to look after her, and since then, has received no interest from any potential owners.\n\nBelieved to be around five years old, Stumpy is often being overlooked by potential owners, who choose to adopt \u2018prettier\u2019 pets instead.\n\nThis has given Stumpy the title of \u2018the ugly ducking\u2019 at the rescue centre.\n\nPoor Stumpy.\n\nShe\u2019s a very happy girl! (Picture: National Centre for Reptile Welfare)\n\nBut the little reptile shouldn\u2019t be overlooked \u2013 because what she lacks in tail she makes up with in personality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe\u2019s a very happy girl, and probably doesn\u2019t even know that her tail is missing.\n\nRescue volunteers say she gets on with her life as normal, and although she doesn\u2019t tend to interact with other animals, she\u2019s always happy to sit and play with visitors.\n\nAnd, Stumpy doesn\u2019t get jealous of other bearded dragons who have full tails \u2013 she\u2019d very tame and happy-go-lucky.\n\nRescue volunteers say her tame persona would make her the perfect addition to a household looking for their first pet.\n\nBearded dragons are one of the most popular pet reptiles in the UK, and can live for up to twenty years, although around 12-15 years is the average. Volunteers at the National Centre for Reptile Welfare believe that it\u2019s their tame, almost \u2018dog-like\u2019, behavioural traits that make them such appealing pets to families.\n\nChris Newman, from the National Centre for Reptile Welfare, said: \u2018Despite her somewhat unusual appearance, Stumpy has a lot of character and would make a great pet. Sadly, people are quick to make judgements before properly getting to know her. She does everything a normal bearded dragon does \u2013 she just does it without a tail!\n\n\u2018We really hope that a family will come forward soon and give her the loving forever home she deserves.\u2019\n\nMORE: Woman reveals what it\u2019s like to have two vaginas, two cervixes and two wombs\n\nMORE: You could earn \u00a3100 to dress as Pennywise and scare your friends this Halloween\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A bearded dragon who had her tail amputated is looking for her forever home because nobody will adopt her.", "authors": ["Hattie Gladwell"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/stumpy-2-c5c2_1571762123.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
