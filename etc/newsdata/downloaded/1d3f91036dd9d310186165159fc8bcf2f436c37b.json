Here, they snack on dead skin cells, multiply by the thousands, and go about their business undisturbed \u2013 potentially, for years.\n\nAccording to Allergy UK, dust mites, or to be precise their toxic waste, are one of the most common causes of respiratory problems. Morning sneezing, itchy eyes, eczema and sinus issues can all be blamed on the microscopic menaces that reside right where we rest our heads.\n\nThe good news though is this: regularly washing pillows on a 60C heat can blast the majority of mites. Better still, you can choose anti-allergy or hypoallergenic pillows that exist to keep these nasty bedfellows at bay.\n\nSo, what to look out for? Most bug-busting pillows are labelled as such. A hypoallergenic pillow is when its material and design is found to be less likely to attract dust mites and trigger allergies or sensitivities. If a pillow is described as anti-allergy, it means it\u2019s been treated and tested to combat mites and protect against their allergens.\n\nFor peace of mind, pick a pillow that\u2019s been given the \u201cseal of approval\u201d from Allergy UK/ British Allergy Foundation. In order to receive this gold standard status, approved pillows have been put through scientific lab tests created by leading allergy experts, to ensure they have reduced allergen content.\n\nWith the matter of the mites in hand, you can focus on the thoroughly pleasurable purpose of your pillow: the safe, comfy spot where you sink your head to have a deep, restful sleep. We\u2019ve done much of the hard graft for you and snooze-tested this healthy selection that left us snuffle and itch free when waking.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

It\u2019s a material that boasts moisture wicking and temperature regulating properties so will keep your head cool in summer and cosy in winter, as well as being naturally hypoallergenic.\n\nWoolroom\u2019s deluxe pillow has clusters of wool balls sourced from British Down breeds of sheep, stuffed inside a 200-thread count organic cotton outer. The pillow has the all-important approval from Allergy UK as it\u2019s naturally resistant to mould, mildew, and the mites that can cause allergies. You can also bung it in the washing machine.\n\nOur pillow arrived looking plump, and was ultra-supportive, yet comfy, when we bedded down. Wool fillings do result in a firmer feel, but if you take the Goldilocks approach to your pillows, \u201ctoo firm\u201d, \u201ctoo flat\u201d, or \u201ctoo soft\u201d can be easily remedied. We loved being able to unzip the pillow and whip out handfuls of wool and disperse the clumps until we hit our comfort sweet spot (store the surplus wool in the natural calico bag that the pillow is delivered in). If you prefer your pillow with even more firmness or loft, there\u2019s a bag of extra wool to buy so you can stuff and adjust until it feels \u201cjust right\u201d.\n\nBuy now\n\nFogarty anti-allergy pillow pair: \u00a310, Dunelm\n\nFogarty is a go-to for quality bedding that won\u2019t break the bank and the brand\u2019s anti-allergy offering didn\u2019t fail to impress us. This pillow is endorsed by the British Allergy Foundation, thanks to its microfibre cover and treated polyester filling that\u2019ll protect against bacteria, fungi and a dust mite invasion.\n\nWe tested the medium set of pillows, which we found to be on the softer end of the support spectrum, but loved its sink-your-head-in comfort and how the shape bounced back to perfectly plump after eight hours of kip. The bonus? It\u2019s a twin pack, so great value for the price.\n\nBuy now\n\nCasper the pillow: \u00a365, Casper\n\nMattress maker Casper has gained somewhat of a cult following for its two-layered pillow-inside-a-pillow that provides great spine alignment and optimum neck support. It\u2019s a thick pillow, so it might not suit if you like to lie on your front, but for back and side sleepers it\u2019s a perfect loft and weighty enough to keep its shape and place throughout the night.\n\nThe pillow\u2019s percale weave cover houses a supportive inner core surrounded by a soft outer shell \u2013 the result is a durable, breathable, hypoallergenic pillow that felt fresh and cooling when we tested it on a warmer than average evening.\n\nBuy now\n\nMarks & Spencer anti-allergy pillow: \u00a315, Marks & Spencer\n\nThis healthy pillow from the high street giant is a squishy, lightweight option that will combat mites thanks to specially blended fibres and a pure cotton cover. And don\u2019t just take our word for it \u2013 its ability to keep your bed allergen-free has been endorsed by the British Allergy Foundation. We tried the medium support pillow and can attest it feels like sleeping on a marshmallow, but for those who prefer more supportive snooze, the firm option may be more suitable.\n\nBuy now\n\nKally adjustable pillow: \u00a339.99, Kally Sleep\n\nEver got a pillow home to find it\u2019s really not the right feel for you? The adjustable pillow from Kally Sleep does what it says on the tin; a versatile design means it meets the demands of different sleepers.\n\nInside the zip-opening quilted cover, you\u2019ll find a stack of four polyester-filled pillow pads. Use just one for a low loft that\u2019s fitting for front snoozers, or load it with all four for a firmer, higher pillow that\u2019s better if you doze on your side. We found using two pads put us in the perfect sleeping position, but the beauty of this pillow is you can try out several feels.\n\nAnd for anyone prone to allergies, the adjustable pillow promotes healthy mite-free sleep and maximum breathability, thanks to a hypoallergenic filling and outer mesh that boasts improved airflow.\n\nBuy now\n\nSainsbury\u2019s Home anti-allergy pillow: \u00a37.33 for two, Sainsbury\u2019s\n\nHere\u2019s an Allergy UK approved pillow that you can pick up along with your weekly shop. Not only is this the cheapest mite-defender on our list, but two pillows come in the bag, making it a no-brainer if you\u2019re busting bugs on a budget. There\u2019s only one choice of support \u2013 medium, so it might not suit all sleepers, but it is packed with active anti-allergy fibres to prevent an allergy flare up. We recommend it as a good \u201csecondary\u201d pillow set on the bed, or perhaps an option for the spare room. Although we can\u2019t vouch for how the pillow stays in shape over time, or after several machine washes, for the price it\u2019s certainly worth a whirl.\n\nBuy now\n\nSilentnight anti-allergy pillow 2-pack: \u00a314, Argos\n\nThis pillow is a favourite among allergy and asthma sufferers. It\u2019s stuffed with a hollowfibre filling that is 100 per cent anti-bacterial as well as earning the thumbs up from Allergy UK, for its ability to prevent pesky mites and the growth of mould. It offer medium support, and we noted how soft and weightless they feel on the bed \u2013 back and side sleepers may need to use two for extra support during the night. Easy to clean, these will survive the 40C washing machine cycle and a bounce around in the tumble drier. The two-pillow pack and reasonable price point gets our nod of approval \u2013 you can buy a few and pile \u2018em high.\n\nBuy now\n\nSealy geltex pillow: \u00a345, Next\n\nIt\u2019s pricey, considering you only get one in the bag, but sink your head into this pillow and you\u2019ll soon understand why the Sealy is the British bedding brand of choice for plenty of posh hotels and cruise ships. This is a geltex pillow, which is an innovative gel-infused foam that\u2019s highly breathable for a better night\u2019s sleep. The growth of fungi is prevented by the pillow\u2019s Purotex micro capsules that release friendly bacteria into the fabric so dust mites can\u2019t survive. The result is an anti-bac pillow that offers the firm-feel support and bounce-back pressure relief of this unique foam / latex combo. We loved it \u2013 feeling fresh and not at all bunged-up when we woke, and Allergy UK loved it, awarding it their full approval for protection against toxic allergens.\n\nBuy now\n\nOtty deluxe pillow: \u00a354.99, Otty\n\nWith a memory foam pillow you don\u2019t get that soft, cloud-like-feel of a polyester-fill, but you do get a supportive pillow that respects your natural sleeping position.

The deluxe pillow mirrors the clever design of the brand\u2019s award winning mattresses with cooling gel infused in its foam and invisible airflow perforations that regulate temperature. The result is a hypoallergenic pillow that will keep you cool in the night, and reduce skin allergies and breathing problems.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Anti-allergy and hypoallergenic pillows\n\nWe were sold on the comfort factor, natural bacteria-busting and dust-mite repelling properties of a wool-filled pillow, so Woolroom\u2019s deluxe pillow wins our best buy accolade.
