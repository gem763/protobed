Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s strange masterpiece, freely adapted by him from Upton Sinclair\u2019s 1927 novel Oil!, is a tragic parable of man\u2019s dependence on this commodity: formerly the lubricant of commercial triumph and technological innovation, and now the dwindling lifeblood of our material prosperity, the unacknowledged driving force of our military conflicts, and even the cause of a coming ecological catastrophe. That dark title threatens a calamity now visible on the horizon: destruction of the Earth itself. And it is all inscribed in the story of the movie\u2019s leading character, a man with the Bunyanesque name of Daniel Plainview.\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis gives perhaps the greatest, certainly the most exotic performance of his career as an oil prospector in the early 20th century, rewarded with colossal wealth that never gives him the smallest pleasure and serves only to amplify the loneliness, paranoia and resentment that were there from the very beginning. Day-Lewis seems to have unlocked this character\u2019s mystery by seizing on a voice: a robust, cantankerous Scots-Irish accent that he has modified from John Huston (a borrowing that itself may have a subtextual reminder of Huston directing The Treasure of the Sierra Madre). As a poor man, Plainview is seen hacking fanatically away in a silver mine, to the accompaniment of an eerie, atonal score by Radiohead\u2019s Jonny Greenwood: he accidentally discovers oil, like the apes at the beginning of Kubrick\u2019s 2001 discovering their opposable thumbs.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Watch the trailer for There Will Be Blood\n\nThe movie perhaps looks even stranger, starker and more unforgiving now than when it was released in 2007. Since then, Day-Lewis has given more emollient and sympathetic performances: as Abraham Lincoln for Spielberg in 2012, and as the fictional English couturier Reynolds Woodcock for Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s Phantom Thread in 2017. Compared with either, Plainview is uncompromising and uningratiating, and it is a grandiloquent performance that could be expected of no one else. Perhaps not Olivier in his screen heyday would have tried something so melodramatically strange \u2013 and yes, the weird \u201cmilkshake\u201d monologue at the end now feels a bit exposed. No one other than Day-Lewis could have carried it off. The film is also intensely, disconcertingly male, a story of male toxicity without any real female dimension.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018A story of male toxicity without any real female dimension\u2019 \u2026 Dillon Freasier and Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood. Photograph: Miramax/Sportsphoto/Allstar\n\nAs a rich man, Plainview is marooned in a huge, dark mausoleum of a house, boasting with black-comic savagery that he will suck up every competitor\u2019s oil like a milkshake. This scene, along with one showing Plainview theatrically driving a stake through a claim map in front of investors, is perhaps there to make us think of Welles\u2019s Charles Kane, the entrepreneur as performative capitalist, bully and showoff. Like Kane, Plainview is a man whose distinction resides in not having something extra but something missing, a gap where his heart should be, a spiritual imbalance generating neurotic, self-destructive energy.\n\nFrom 2016, there has been a raging Plainview in plain sight in the White House: Trump\n\nIt could also be that Anderson was inspired by Nicolas Roeg\u2019s underrated movie Eureka from 1983, based on a true story, with Gene Hackman as the super-rich Arctic prospector Jack McCann, who was eventually to face loneliness and a grisly death.\n\nThere Will Be Blood may itself have been an influence on The Social Network, directed by David Fincher, in which Jesse Eisenberg\u2019s Mark Zuckerman is driven by resentment and rage to create the social media world that now rules our lives. But from 2016, there has been a raging Plainview in plain sight in the White House: Trump, the eccentric property billionaire and spoilt baby whose cranky tweets are as crazy as Plainview\u2019s deranged \u201cmilkshake\u201d pronouncement.\n\nWhat a spectacle Anderson and Day-Lewis create: a portrait of male belligerence and fear, a Tutankhamun of misery, walled up in his own sarcophagus of wealth and prestige.", "description": "Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s tragic parable of society\u2019s addiction to oil, fuelled by a zealous Daniel Day-Lewis, is a burning indictment of male aggression and an apocalyptic warning", "authors": ["Peter Bradshaw"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9139b2ac8621c32ccc78aabf5882a8b3cf599997/151_524_3854_2312/master/3854.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b9568b704417ec261138d4beeb4d7952", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
