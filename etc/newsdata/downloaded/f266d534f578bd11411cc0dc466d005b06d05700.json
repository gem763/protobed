USA TODAY\n\nThe world of Westeros just got a little smaller.\n\nA potential prequel series to HBO's blockbuster \"Game of Thrones\" starring Naomi Watts is not moving forward at the premium cable network, Deadline and The Hollywood Reporter said Tuesday.\n\nThe unnamed series was one of five \"Thrones\" spinoff concepts HBO considered after the ratings juggernaut finished its eighth and final season earlier this year. It was the only one to film a pilot episode over the summer, but the network ultimately passed.\n\nThe nixed series would have been in the world of Westeros, but thousands of years before the events of \"Thrones.\"\n\nPeter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister on \"Game of Thrones.\" (Photo: Helen Sloan/HBO)\n\nBritish screenwriter and producer Jane Goldman (\"Kingsman\" franchise, \"X-Men: First Class\") and George R.R. Martin, the author of the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series on which \"Thrones\" is based, developed the series together. The initial synopsis said it would \"chronicle the world\u2019s descent from the golden Age of Heroes into its darkest hour. And only one thing is for sure: from the horrifying secrets of Westeros\u2019s history to the true origin of the White Walkers, the mysteries of the East to the Starks of legend \u2026 it\u2019s not the story we think we know.\"\n\nSep 22, 2019; Los Angeles, CA, USA; Naomi Watts arrives at the 71st Emmy Awards at the Microsoft Theater.

The network is expected to confirm plans for a second pilot, based on Martin's \"Fire & Blood,\" that details the history of Westeros and the Targaryens, an era of the story much closer to the events of the original series.\n\nMore: A 'Game of Thrones' final season do-over?
