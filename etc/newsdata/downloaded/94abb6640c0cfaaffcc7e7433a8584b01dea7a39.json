Either voters are not privy to the testimony available to congressional investigators, or they do not feel that the topics covered in a phone call between President Donald Trump and the president of Ukraine is an impeachable offense.\n\nWith regard to impeachment, two common threads run through the entire Suffolk poll: 1) \u201cProcess trumps politics\u201d for many voters, and 2) Independent voters will tip the scales in the court of public opinion.\n\nWhen it comes to the \u201cprocess,\u201d voters of all parties are at odds with the White House. Nearly 66% of registered voters believe the White House should comply with subpoenas from the House committees that are demanding testimony and documents. Just 26% disagreed, and 8% were undecided. Compliance was supported broadly, not only among Democrats (91%) and Independents (68%), but even among 35% of Republicans.\n\nUSA TODAY/Suffolk Poll: Who's sticking with President Trump, through trouble and tweets? His seemingly unshakable\n\nProtesters in Cambridge, Mass., called on Congress to impeach President Trump during Tax Day demonstrations last month. More\n\nAt this point, voters are split on impeachment and whether the topics discussed in the July phone call are an impeachable offense. Nearly 38% of voters said the phone conversation was an impeachable offense, 21% said the phone call was wrong but did not rise to that level, and 31% said there was nothing wrong with the phone conversation.\n\nDemocrats, Republicans, and Independents are each viewing the contents of this same phone call through radically different lenses. Nearly three quarters of Democrats (72%) believe it is an impeachable offense, while just 7% of Republicans thought it merited impeachment. Among Independents, 28% felt it was cause for impeachment. Meanwhile, 30% said that the call was wrong but not cause for impeachment, and 32% said there was nothing wrong with the call.\n\nPolitical party again determined voters\u2019 answers when they were asked outright if Trump should be impeached. When voters were asked their personal preference on impeachment, 36% said that Trump should be impeached, while 37% said Congress should drop its investigations of the president. Another 22% said Congress should continue investigating the president, but not vote to impeach him at this point.\n\nThe majority of the \u201cimpeachers\u201d plan to vote for the Democratic nominee and most of the \u201cacquitters\u201d plan to vote for Trump. However, the \u201cinvestigators\u201d \u2013 the people who support continuing to investigate the President, but are not on board with impeaching him yet \u2013 are politically split. Thirty-eight percent of \u201cinvestigators\u201d say they plan to vote for the Democratic nominee and 27% plan to vote for Trump. A sizeable 20% claim that they are voting for a third party candidate\u2014double the 10% of all voters who say they will vote third-party.\n\nIronically, as the investigations continue and Democrats and Republicans plead their cases to the public, the result is that a large number of \u201cinvestigators\u201d are thumbing their noses at both parties, and instead voting for a third party candidate.\n\nAnd which television networks do third party voters trust for their news on the impeachment process? According to the Suffolk poll, among those who trust C-SPAN the most, 18% are third-party voters. Among those who most trust CBS, 24% are voting third party. Of those who trust ABC News the most, 28% are voting third-party\u2014nearly three times the nationwide 10%. These are 1992 Ross Perot numbers, almost thirty years later, in 2019.\n\nMitt Romney: a solitary GOP voice battling Trump for the soul of the Republican Party\n\nThere happens to be a unique overlap between these media outlets, third party voters, and independent voters. The triangulation of these three groups\u2014or lack thereof\u2014could lead to Trump\u2019s political vindication or strangulation. These forensic findings might prove vital to Democratic leaders and Trump, who can focus their messages on these TV platforms in the coming weeks if they choose to heed my (free) advice.", "description": "Paleologos: Voters hold strong views on both sides about impeaching President Trump, but the key are voters in the middle haven't made up their minds.", "authors": ["David Paleologos", "Suffolk Political Research Center"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Kh2uWYwwuf6jL0PVsuD8aQ--~B/aD0zODQwO3c9NTc2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/a72db0113714de4284f530e78550d7cc", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
