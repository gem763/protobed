The other 11 Premiership clubs are expecting Saracens to be found guilty and given a significant punishment following Sportsmail's revelations last March of investment partnerships and property-sharing arrangements between Saracens owner Nigel Wray and leading players, including Farrell, Maro Itoje and Mako and Billy Vunipola.\n\nWhile the clubs had originally hoped for a verdict before the domestic season began last weekend, Sportsmail has been told the majority of chairmen understand a judgment being delayed because of the World Cup.\n\nWith six Saracens players in England's starting XV against Australia for last weekend's quarter-final, club bosses are acutely aware of the sensitivity of the timing and the potential for a judgment to disrupt England's campaign in particular.\n\nPRL declined to comment yesterday.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Premiership Rugby have deferred announcing the results of the inquiry into Saracens' alleged breach of the salary cap due to fears of derailing England's World Cup bid.", "authors": ["Matt Hughes", "Laura Lambert For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/21/20008132-0-image-a-65_1571691390350.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
