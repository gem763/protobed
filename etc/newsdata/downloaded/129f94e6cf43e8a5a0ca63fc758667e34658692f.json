The Democrats are frozen with hatred and fear. They get nothing done,\" Trump wrote online. \"This should never be allowed to happen to another President. Witch Hunt!\"\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe morning message followed a string of posts Tuesday night sharing clips of segments by his conservative cable news allies \u2014 including Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity of Fox News, as well as Lou Dobbs of the Fox Business Network \u2014 blasting Pelosi\u2019s historic maneuver and defending Trump amid heightened scrutiny over his summer phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president.\n\nDuring that conversation on July 25 between the two leaders, which is at the heart of House Democrats\u2019 renewed push to oust the president from office, Trump reportedly pressured newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky roughly eight times to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. Trump acknowledged Sunday that he discussed Biden, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, during the call.\n\nPOLITICO reported in August that the president was slow-walking hundreds of millions of dollars in military funds to Ukraine, and the The Washington Post reported Monday that Trump directed his acting White House chief of staff to hold back the financial aid at least a week before his call with Zelensky.\n\nTrump\u2019s statements during the call are also believed to be a component of the complaint an anonymous whistleblower filed in early August to the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general, who deemed the allegations credible and \u201curgent.\u201d\n\nTrump on Tuesday afternoon announced he had authorized the release sometime Wednesday of \"the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript\" of his call with Zelensky. A senior administration official confirmed Tuesday evening that the White House is also preparing to release both the whistleblower complaint and the inspector general\u2019s report to Congress by the end of the week.\n\nRudy Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, predicted Wednesday that the transcript of the Zelensky call would amount to \"a big nothing-burger,\" and asserted that the president would have been \"derelict in his duty\" to not bring up the unfounded accusations of wrongdoing by the Bidens during the conversation with his foreign counterpart.\n\n\"You're going to say, 'My God, why \u2014 how could he have not raised it?\" Giuliani told the hosts of \"Fox & Friends,\" adding: \"Who could get allegations of a serious nature investigated about a vice president? Is a president of a country going to listen to, I don't know, an FBI agent?\"", "description": "\"This should never be allowed to happen to another President,\" he tweeted.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/cb/18/62fb9a8b46339ba7117e6d336ce0/190925-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
