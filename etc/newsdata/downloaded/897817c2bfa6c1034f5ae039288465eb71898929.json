But this time, she read the powerful statement as herself: Chanel Miller.\n\nTurner was arrested in January 2015 for sexually assaulting an unconscious Miller behind a dumpster outside a fraternity party at Stanford University. Turner, who at the time was a Stanford student, was sentenced to only six months in county jail after being convicted of three felony sexual assault charges in March 2016. He was released after serving three months.\n\nFour years after the assault, Miller is ready to be known by her real name. In a powerful clip from \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Miller reads part of her victim impact statement that shook the country.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know me, but you\u2019ve been inside me,\u201d Miller reads from her statement in the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d clip. \u201cIn newspapers, my name was \u2018unconscious, intoxicated woman.\u2019 Ten syllables, and nothing more than that. I had to force myself to relearn my real name, my identity. To relearn that this is not all that I am.\u201d\n\nShe has been known to the world as \u201cEmily Doe,\u201d the sexual assault victim of Stanford swimmer Brock Turner. Now she\u2019s revealing her name and face. Chanel Miller, here reading her victim impact statement, gives her first interview to \"60 Minutes\" https://t.co/U4GDOofVj6 pic.twitter.com/cpVMwCZ4Sk \u2014 60 Minutes (@60Minutes) September 4, 2019\n\nThe short video comes ahead of a full \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview with Miller, set to air on Sunday, Sept. 22 at 7:30 p.m. Eastern.\n\nTurner\u2019s lenient sentence set off worldwide criticism and eventually sparked the recall of the judge who handed down the light sentence. The former Stanford swimmer had filed an appeal in 2017, claiming the encounter between him and Miller was consensual. Last year, attorneys for Turner attempted to appeal a separate charge, arguing that Turner only wanted \u201coutercourse\u201d \u2015 sexual contact while fully clothed, he explained \u2015 not intercourse. Turner lost both appeals.\n\nMiller\u2019s memoir is expected to publish Sept. 24, and \u201cwill reclaim the story of her sexual assault, expose the arduous nature of the legal system, and emerge as a bold, unifying voice,\u201d according to Viking, her publisher.\n\nAndrea Schulz, the editor in chief of Viking, told the Times that the memoir is \u201cone of the most important books\u201d she\u2019s ever published. She added that she hopes it will \u201cchange the culture that we live in and the assumptions we make about what survivors should be expected to go through to get justice.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the title of Miller\u2019s memoir.", "description": "Chanel Miller, known only as Emily Doe for years, read her emotional impact statement in a teaser for her first public interview on \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d", "authors": ["Women'S Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6facf82400004f007386f7.png?cache=p6l7ptesih&ops=1778_1000"}
