Two years earlier he had earned the rainbow stripes as world road race champion, making him one of the most successful riders of his generation.\n\nHe retired from professional racing early in 2015, but has remained in what most mortals would consider as fine racing fettle. On occasions, he comes out to tackle more unusual events for fun.\n\nSome of these events have been in Asia, and he recently took part in the new Coupe de Hue stage sportive event in Vietnam, as part of his role with the BMC bike brand, a Switzerland-based manufacturer and his former sponsor.\n\nDespite having raced at the highest level the Asian scene is quite new to Evans.\n\n\u201cI have to say after that after racing for years in North America and Europe, to go to these countries \u2013 particularly in Asia \u2013 and to see events and the cycling culture has been interesting, and as the sport becomes more international it\u2019s good to be a part of this and the new cultures coming into cycling,\u201d he said.\n\nHaving retired, the Tour de France spirit is not dead, even in sportive events in Asia.\n\n\u201cWhen I did the Hue event there was an uphill time trial so of course I did go for it a bit,\u201d Evans said. \u201cI trained some for it too \u2013 with the time I have available to ride.\u201d\n\nWith his work as BMC brand ambassador time is somewhat limited for the 42-year old.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like when I was professional, when my life revolved around riding a bike and performance,\u201d Evans said. \u201cNow I ride when I have time. I don\u2019t do nearly as many kilometres as people think (30,000km a year less). But of course I do like to ride, and having less time to do it means that I probably enjoy it even more now.\n\n\u201cI try to be fit, and I had a go in the TT [time trail] and was focused. To put a number on once in a while, I enjoy it. That\u2019s in full acceptance that I\u2019m not going to be the best in the world, I\u2019m doing about 30,000km less a year in racing and training now.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to going longer he knows that it\u2019s a different story.\n\n\u201cOn the next day it was much longer, which requires a whole other level of fitness,\u2019 he said. \u201cI rode with the front group to the halfway point, where I stopped and shook hands with the local mayor. From then we went up to the Laos border and I rode back on my own.\u201d\n\nIt proved to be a highlight of his Vietnamese visit: \u201cObviously the cycling culture there is not as developed as in Europe, but the roads are very good and there\u2019s not much traffic. The scenery was spectacular, and as a foreigner who hasn\u2019t travelled in Asia much, everything is different.\u201d\n\nThe Asian race scene has thrived in the past decade, although major races are still thin on the ground. There are also some riders mixing World Tour racing with \u201calternative\u201d events around the world, including in Asia.\n\nIf such opportunity had arisen in his heyday would it have lured him in? \u201cOne of the greatest races I went to as a bike rider was the Japan Cup, in the early years of the race. A lot of those races were very young and developing. As a professional I was quite elitist, and it was all about how I performed and my World/Pro Tour points and what I did in the big tours.\u201d\n\nDespite his early mountain biking pedigree the opportunity to mix racing disciplines and tackle unusual events was unheard of at the time, and still is for all but a few pro road racers.\n\n\u201cI was very rational in what I did and my performance,\u201d Evans said. \u201cNow I don\u2019t have to worry about the performance \u2013 I can go there and enjoy it. I can also do more bucket list events, a retired rider like myself can do this.\u201d\n\nLast year he tackled the Taiwan KOM event, which is the longest uphill race in the world (103km with 83km of climbing). Few riders have ever ridden uphill for that long before.\n\n\u201cThat was part of the curiosity,\u201d Evans said. \u201cThe KOM was also a bucket list event for me, which I\u2019d always wanted to do, maybe not as a professional though. The legs didn\u2019t actually feel as bad as you\u2019d imagine.\u201d\n\nIn late 2018 he also did some riding in Hong Kong, around the time of the Cyclothon.\n\n\u201cHong Kong, being a very multicultural place means that I was riding with Australians and Americans as well as locals. In Europe cycling is often something of a working class sport, whereas in the US, Australia and Asia it\u2019s maybe more of an executive sport \u2013 as I experienced in Hong Kong,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cyclists seem to have more disposable income, and love the best kit. I have to say that the Asian cyclists dress so well on the bike, they look great.\u201d\n\nThis was a theme he noticed in many regions of Asia; \u201cWhat amazes me is that you go to some places in Asia [like Korea and Singapore] and they have their own really strong cycling culture. They have their own clothing brands, their own style, and some of these places it\u2019s seemingly more about how you look than how well you ride. To go and experience this is interesting for someone who comes from the more regular western cycling culture.\u201d\n\nOn October 27, he will be back in Asia for the L\u2019Etape Thailand sportive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve ridden there a little bit. Thailand, it\u2019s a place I can take my family and they can enjoy that and I can go and ride my bike a little bit, which I\u2019m looking forward to.\u201d\n\nAs for the future, don\u2019t be surprised to see more of Evans on Asian roads, although as of yet his plans don\u2019t run that far ahead.", "description": "The Australian won the Tour de France in 2011, and is now using his retirement to test his legs in the Far East", "authors": ["Steve Thomas"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/18/98228034-f0a0-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39_image_hires_164412.jpg?itok=I2B525hP&v=1571388260", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
