(AP Photo/Gregory Bull)\n\nSpiking drinks with cocaine, shooting Iraqi civilians, strangling a Green Beret: The Navy SEAL teams have been rocked by one high-profile scandal after another in recent months, and the leader of the elite commando force, Rear Adm. Collin P. Green, has vowed to clean house.\n\nGreen has come down hard on misconduct, fired two key leaders and made an unusually public admission that the Navy\u2019s secretive warrior caste has an \u201cethics problem.\u201d At the same time, though, he has steered wide of the SEAL at the center of one of the grimmest episodes, Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher, who was charged with shooting civilians, murdering a captive Islamic State fighter with a knife, and threatening to kill witnesses.\n\nGallagher was acquitted of murder charges this summer, but evidence that he had engaged in a range of other misconduct, including theft and drug use, had come to light during the investigation. Green and other Navy leaders were planning to demote him and force him out of the SEALs \u2014 sending a message that such conduct had no place in one of the country\u2019s premier fighting forces.\n\nNone of that has happened, though, because one of Gallagher\u2019s most vocal supporters happens to be the commander in chief. President Donald Trump has repeatedly intervened, and has posted so many expressions of support for the SEAL on Twitter that the Navy now sees Gallagher as untouchable, according to three Navy officials familiar with the case. Any talk of punishment has been shelved, not only for the chief, but for two other SEALs who had been facing possible discipline in the case, these officials said.\n\nTrump helped Gallagher get released from confinement before his trial, and personally congratulated him on Twitter when he was acquitted.\n\n\u201cPeople want to hold these guys accountable,\u201d said one Navy officer who was involved in the punishment deliberations. \u201cBut they are afraid that if you do anything, minutes later there will be a tweet from the White House, and the officer in charge will get axed.\u201d\n\nThe officer, like others interviewed for this article, asked that his name not be used because he feared retaliation.\n\nThe president has previously made it clear that he believes the country should tread carefully when calling American troops to account for acts of war. Only last week, he announced on Twitter that the White House was reviewing the case of Maj. Mathew Golsteyn, a former Army Special Forces soldier charged with murder in the death of a Taliban bomb maker in Afghanistan. \u201cWe train our boys to be killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill!\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nThe issue in Gallagher\u2019s case became apparent to Green\u2019s team in August, when the chief\u2019s lawyers \u2014 including one of Trump\u2019s personal lawyers, Marc Mukasey, who joined the defense team two months before the June court-martial \u2014 had tried and failed to persuade Navy commanders to suspend any punishment. Soon after that, the president brought up the Gallagher case at a meeting with the Secretary of the Navy and the Chief of Naval Operations, according to a senior Navy official.\n\nWhite House officials strongly denied that the Gallagher case was discussed. But hours after the meeting, the Chief of Naval Operations announced that he would personally take over the Gallagher case from another admiral, who had indicated that she planned to punish the chief.\n\nThe Navy had also planned to discipline two other SEALs who had come under investigation in the Gallagher case: Lt. Jacob Portier, who was charged with not reporting Gallagher\u2019s actions in Iraq; and Special Operator 1st Class Corey Scott, a platoon medic whose testimony at the chief\u2019s trial prompted the Navy to open a perjury investigation. But the day after the White House meeting, the charges against Portier were dropped and the investigation of Scott was ended.\n\nThe intervention from Washington left Navy leaders with a dilemma: Not punishing Gallagher and the others would undermine efforts to restore discipline in the ranks, but punishing them only to be publicly reversed might make things even worse.\n\n\u201cAll that\u2019s off the table now,\u201d said a Navy Special Warfare officer who was briefed on the most recent deliberations of Green\u2019s team about the matter. Navy commanders grew concerned that if they took away from Gallagher the Trident pin that signifies membership in the SEALs, only to see the president give it back again, the officer said, \u201cit sends a message that the commanders aren\u2019t in control.\u201d", "description": "Spiking drinks with cocaine, shooting Iraqi civilians, strangling a Green Beret: The Navy SEAL teams have been rocked by one high-profile scandal after another in recent months, and the leader of the elite commando force, Rear Adm.
