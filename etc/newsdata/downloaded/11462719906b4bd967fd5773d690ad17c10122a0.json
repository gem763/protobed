Canadian Wholesales Unexpectedly Decline on Weak Machinery Sales\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Canada\u2019s wholesalers posted a surprise decline in August as machinery and equipment sales pulled back.\n\nCanadian wholesales fell 1.2% in August, Statistics Canada reported Wednesday from Ottawa. That missed the 0.3% gain that economists surveyed by Bloomberg were expecting.\n\nDecreases were widespread, with five of seven subsectors declining. Stripping out price effects, wholesale volumes fell 1.3% from July.\n\nMachinery and equipment fell for the second month in a row, leading declines and falling 2.6% in August. Construction, forestry, mining, and industrial machinery and equipment were the main downside contributors. A continued slowdown in these sectors may be worrying signal when it comes to the investment outlook in Canada.\n\nWholesale inventories also fell for the first time in a year, down 0.3% in August. Still, the inventory-to-sales ratio ticked up to 1.45, remaining at one of the highest levels since the early 1990s -- a possible risk to future growth prospects.\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "Canadian Wholesales Unexpectedly Decline on Weak Machinery Sales", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC9H0RA_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
