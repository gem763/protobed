He very much regrets and is very sorry for doing what he did in July.\"\n\nIn a statement, a spokesman from Real Estate Management (UK) Limited, which manages The Shard, said: \"Mr George King-Thompson has today been found to be in contempt of court for breaching the terms of an injunction set by the High Court in 2018 when he climbed The Shard earlier this year.\n\n\"We felt we had no option than to secure the injunction and ask the court to uphold it.\n\n\"We hope that today's outcome will deter other prospective climbers, and help them recognise the great dangers that these actions pose to the public, emergency services and themselves.\"", "description": "Oxford 20-year-old George King-Thompson climbed the 310-metre (1,017ft) building from the ground floor to near the very top in just 45 minutes", "authors": ["Sam Tobin", "Image", "Champion News", "Powers.Of.Passion Instagram", "Itv", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article17511305.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Shard.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
