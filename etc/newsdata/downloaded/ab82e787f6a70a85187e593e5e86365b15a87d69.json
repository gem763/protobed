This could result in lost labor force productivity when/if the MAX does return to service. We have seen the consequences of such events in shipbuilding: it can be ugly,\" said Spingarn.\n\nUBS also downgraded Boeing's biggest supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, to \"neutral\" from \"buy\" and cut its target price on the stock to $88 from $92, citing possible production cuts.
