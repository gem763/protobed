That\u2019s why we got involved in the first place.\u201d\n\nWarren under attack as Democrats spar in largest primary debate in US history Read more\n\nAn invasion of north-eastern Syria by Turkey last week after Trump announced the withdrawal of US forces on Twitter has resulted in numerous reports of detained Isis fighters breaking out of \u2013 or simply walking away from \u2013 prisons where they had been held by Kurdish fighters formerly allied with the US who are now under attack from Turkish forces.\n\nBiden also warned that he believed if Trump were re-elected in November 2020, \u201cthere will be no Nato\u201d.\n\nThe architects of the so-called \u201cwar on terror\u201d, and especially the Republican backers of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and an expansive US presence in the Middle East, have long warned that the US must intervene abroad in order to prevent attacks at home.\n\nQuestioned on Friday about a potential risk posed by Isis fighters freed amid the Syrian turmoil, Trump said it was Europe\u2019s problem.\n\n\u201cWell, they are going to be escaping to Europe, that\u2019s where they want to go,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to go back to their homes.\u201d\n\nMultiple Democratic candidates at the primary debate in Ohio condemned what they called Trump\u2019s betrayal of American allies in the region.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to hear from him about how leaving the Kurds for slaughter, leaving our allies for slaughter, makes America great again,\u201d the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar said.\n\nBut it was Biden, the longtime chairman of the foreign relations committee during his Senate days, who offered the most scathing assessment of Trump\u2019s foreign policy \u2013 and presented the most alarming picture of its potential consequences.\n\nBiden noted that he was the only candidate on stage to have dealt personally with both Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, and Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.\n\n\u201cErdo\u011fan understands that if he is out of Nato, he is in real trouble,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut we have an erratic crazy president who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy and operates only [to advance] his own re-election.\n\n\u201cIf he gets re-elected,\u201d Biden continued, \u201cI promise you there will be no Nato, our security will be vastly underrated, we will be in real trouble.\u201d\n\nBiden blasted Trump for abandoning Kurdish allies in northern Syria. \u201cIt has been the most shameful thing that any president has done in modern history in terms of foreign policy,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is shameful, shameful, what this man has done.\u201d\n\nIn his closing statement, Biden returned once more to attacking Trump: \u201cThis president has ripped the soul out of this country.\u201d\n\nIn another fiery exchange, the two veterans on the stage \u2013 Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and the Hawaii representative Tulsi Gabbard \u2013 clashed over Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw US troops from Syria, which paved the way for a Turkish military assault on Syrian Kurds.\n\nGabbard, who has been sharply criticized over a meeting with the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, accused Trump of having the \u201cblood of the Kurds on his hands\u201d but she continued: \u201cSo do many of the politicians in both parties who supported this regime change war.\u201d\n\nButtigieg shot back that she was \u201cdead wrong\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump\u2019s policy, as you\u2019re doing,\u201d he said.\n\nLauren Gambino contributed reporting", "description": "Former vice-president said at Democratic debate \u2018they are going to damage\u2019 the US and blasted Trump for abandoning Kurdish allies", "authors": ["Tom Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c79c980982bacd43202106ee1e88ce1c2207c994/0_254_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=91108c1c59c6cd9e7f15f4fd43e54d9b", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
