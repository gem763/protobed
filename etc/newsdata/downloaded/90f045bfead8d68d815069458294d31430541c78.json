An average of RealClearPolitics polls shows she sits at 1.3% nationwide. The presidential candidate has seen her profile rise in recent days after failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called her, without evidence, \u201cthe favorite of the Russians\u201d and speculated that the Kremlin is \u201cgrooming\u2019 her to run as a third-party candidate.\n\nAppearing on a podcast hosted by David Plouffe, President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign manager, Clinton claimed of the Hawaii Democrat:\n\n[Russia] has a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting [Gabbard] so far. That\u2019s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she is also a Russian asset. They know they can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate, and so I do not know who it\u2019s going to be, but I can guarantee you they will have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most need it.\n\nShortly after, Gabbard hit back at the Obama-era secretary of state in a series of tweets, branding her the \u201cqueen of warmongers\u201d and accused her of being behind a New York Times hit piece.\n\n\u2026 concerted campaign to destroy my reputation. We wondered who was behind it and why. Now we know \u2014 it was always you, through your proxies and \u2026 \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019\n\n\u2026 powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose. It\u2019s now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don\u2019t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly. \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019\n\nGabbard, a four-term congresswoman and military combat veteran who served in Iraq, represents Hawaii\u2019s Second Congressional District. She is the first Hindu elected to Congress and the first member born in the U.S. territory of American Samoa. Gabbard announced her intention to seek the presidency on February 2nd during a rally on Oahu, Hawaii.\n\nThe 37-year-old became politically active in 2002, when voters elected her to represent the 42nd House District in the Hawaii House of Representatives. She was the youngest person elected to the state legislature at age 21.\n\nGabbard declined to run for re-election in 2004 when she joined the Army National Guard and volunteered to serve in Iraq. She served two tours of duty as a member of the 29th Support Battalion medical company. During her first 12-month tour, she received the Meritorious Service Medal and during her second tour, she was commissioned as a second lieutenant after graduating from the Accelerated Officer Candidate School at the Alabama Military Academy.\n\nGabbard re-entered politics in 2010 when voters elected her to the Honolulu City Council. There she served as chairwoman of the Safety, Economic Development and Government Affairs Committee and vice chairwoman of the Budget Committee.\n\nShe was elected to represent Hawaii in the House of Representatives in 2012.\n\nGabbard was one of the most prominent lawmakers to back Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) over Clinton in the 2016 Democrat presidential primary. Her endorsement came in dramatic fashion, with her resigning as a vice chairwoman of the Democrat National Committee to express her support.\n\nThe Associated Press and UPI contributed to this story.", "description": "Rep.
