Circuit Court of Appeals largely upheld the Federal Communications Commission's move to end net neutrality protections, but allowed states to set their own rules and sent portions of the original order back to the commission for clarification and review.\n\nWhy it matters: For a decade, net neutrality rules, which aim to prevent owners of internet networks from favoring some content and traffic, have been a lightning rod for conflict over internet governance. The new ruling means the FCC's 2017 removal of national net neutrality rules put in place by the Obama administration will stand, but opens the door to individual states mandating their own net neutrality protections.", "description": "A court decides the FCC's overturn of net neutrality provisions stands, but states can set their own rules.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/cR8HUY6P5TriUI8Kr05wm13mudQ=/0x169:3000x1857/1920x1080/2019/10/01/1569946370613.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
