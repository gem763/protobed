Ken Goldin told TMZ Sports he expects the jersey to fetch in the \"mid-six figures.\" Collectors can place bids through Oct. 19 on the iconic gold St. Vincent-St. Mary jersey.\n\nJames won Ohio's Mr. Basketball award three times in high school and became the first underclassman to appear on the SI cover. The cover was seen as something of a turning point for LeBronMania, as scouts and fans flocked to see a player many considered to be the greatest high schooler in history.\n\nJames' national attention reached such a fever pitch that his games were broadcast on pay-per-view during his senior season.\n\nAt the time, it was considered impossible for LeBron to ever live up to the hype his high school stardom created.\n\nWhoops.\n\nLeBron not only met but exceeded every possible expectation, joining a short list of players to have a claim at being the greatest in the history of basketball. The jersey, which was given to a friend by LeBron years ago, represents the beginning of that journey.\n\nDon't be surprised if the auction reaches eye-popping numbers.", "description": "The jersey that introduced  LeBron James  to the world is coming up for auction.
