Our tolerance for vendettas has been exhausted. Those who cannot accept the results of the presidential election should be forced out of government and be held responsible for the trouble they have caused. In football there are penalties for interference, and there should be in law, too.\n\nPresident Trump knows our problems. He knows how to fix them and he fixes them. He loves this country and trusts in God. It is time to deal seriously with people whose intentions toward him and the country are worse than negative and getting worse by the minute. We have a whole country to care about and want to pursue our happiness in peace, free of this unworthy pestilence (Nancy and friends).\n\nELIZABETH WARD NOTTRODT\n\nAuthor, \u201cTruth: The Golden Heresy\u201d\n\nBaltimore\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
