The court heard that if it had exploded it would have caused a devastating firebomb and killed or injured at least 60 people in a nearby bar. They were sentenced to 30 years and 25 years in prison respectively.\n\nProsecutors said they had parked the car after sending a video claiming responsibility for the planned attack to Rachid Kassim, a French member of Isis. Kassim was sentenced in absentia to life in jail, according to Le Figaro.\n\nWoman charged over failed terror attack on Notre Dame in Paris Read more\n\nMadani enticed her fellow defendant to join the plot by posing online as a male Islamist militant who had returned from Syria and was seeking a bride, the court was told.\n\nThe court heard that Madani, the fourth of five daughters of a bus driver, had turned to both drugs and religious study after being sexually assaulted aged 17. A close female friend had left to join Isis\u2019 in Syria and Madani\u2019s father had warned the authorities his daughter was also susceptible to leave for jihad.\n\nTwo other defendants, Sarah Hervouet and Amel Sakaou, who acted in concert with Madani and Gilligmann, were each sentenced to 20 years.\n\nA fifth woman, Samia Chalel, was also tried for allegedly helping hide Madani. She was sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nAnother woman and man were given lesser sentences for failing to report a terrorist crime.\n\nReuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this article", "description": "Two women with ties to Islamist militants sentenced to at least 25 years for unsuccessful 2016 atttack", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d739f73961deeecbd5425b3dc452664455db01e/0_433_4739_2844/master/4739.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fc745c89bf31e2cb408dc18f4458165b", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
