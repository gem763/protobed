But few in media circles think this is the deal that puts it back on the IPO track. At best, Vice can hope to convince some bigger player to buy it.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nStarted in 1994 as an alternative-culture magazine in Montreal, founder Shane Smith crossed the border and expanded Vice into a multiplatform media conglomerate with a cable TV channel, branded series on HBO and a dozen websites convincing investors along the way to sign on board and push the company to an eye-popping $5.7 billion valuation. But layoffs, sexual harassment allegations and advertising challenges have taken its toll on the company -- widely seen as having a for sale sign hanging on it.\n\nOne company some analysts have targeted as a possible buyer of Vice Media is the newly formed ViacomCBS. Its CEO, Bob Bakish, recently said that he is not going to seek any transaction that would negatively impact the new company\u2019s stock price. \u201cIn the near term ViacomCBS won\u2019t do anything substantial,\u201d a person with direct knowledge of Bakish\u2019s thinking told Fox Business' Charles Gasparino on Sept. 5. \u201cTo the extent, a good opportunity comes up (Viacom) would take it but (Bakish) will be highly disciplined when it comes to acquisitions.\u201d\n\nWhether or not Vice would qualify as \"good opportunity\" would depend on the price, but one leading media observer thinks Vice would fit in well with ViacomCBS.\n\n\u201cThat would be the most obvious one,\u201d Alan Wolk, co-founder and lead analyst at TVREV. \u201cViacom has had an incredible turnaround by accentuating the fact that they have an \u2018in\u2019 to that 18-to-34-year-old audience. (Vice) would be a good fit for Pluto, which is their fast, free ad-supported streaming TV service, and I could see it under that umbrella or separately. They already own Awesomeness TV, which a YouTube channel that\u2019s aimed very squarely at, let\u2019s say, middle-school girl audience, and then, his would be an older audience, be 20-something, but very squarely in that 18-to-34 demo that Viacom wants.\u201d\n\nWolk sees other companies being interested, such as \u201cDisney, because they\u2019re also after that youth market; Hulu even, because it\u2019s a little bit more sophisticated \u2013 Hulu\u2019s obviously a part of Disney. I could definitely see that being a thought of theirs.\u201d\n\nThe question is would Disney look to recoup its investment or has it given up on Vice? In November 2018, Disney wrote down $157 million of its initial 2016 investment of $400 million after reports suggested that Vice was expected to lose $50 million as its revenue fell flat.\n\nVice is funded by 10 other investors, with 23 Capital and Soros Fund Management the most recent investors, and with this deal, is now valuing itself at about $3.6 billion.\n\n\"It was about time for the consolidation of publishers \u2013 none of them have really taken off, and that\u2019s really going to be the only way they kind of get ahead\" - Alan Wolk, co-founder and lead analyst, TVREV\n\nDigital deals have been on the move of late with Vox\u2019s purchase last week of legacy publication New York Magazine, and Whistle, the sports and entertainment digital media company, bought Vertical Networks, which focuses on Snapchat original shows.\n\n\u201cConsolidation is going to happen in any industry, you have it in every industry, right,\u201d says Wolk. \u201cIt was about time for the consolidation of publishers \u2013 none of them have really taken off, and that\u2019s really going to be the only way they kind of get ahead. I think those two companies are an interesting mix because they\u2019re very different; it will be interesting to see how they come together. In those situations, it\u2019s really a jump ball because, you know, they could work really well, figure out economies of scale, or just mess it up completely.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nVice and Refinery29 have reportedly been in talks since July, when the latter was searching for a partner to combine with amid tightening finances.\n\nWhile Refinery29 says it will remain a distinct brand within the Vice Media Group portfolio, the potential to expand its videos into Vice\u2019s cable network, Viceland, is one that could bolster the Refinery brand.\n\nThis deal has given Vice an expanded reach more female millennials and now, it \u201cwill have a workforce that is majority women,\" the company said in a release. That should help its image after the harrassment allegations.\n\nRefinery29 has raised over $120 million to date. Executives said in May that the company brought in more than $100 million in revenue last year, and at that time, they were looking to raise an additional $20 million. The new investment is in the form of convertible debt, would bring the total amount the firm has raised to $145.4 million since 2010.\n\nThis deal with Vice will help the women-centric website grow internationally. Vice says its global footprint accounts for 50 percent of its revenue, and its global audience reach will also go up around 17% with the addition of Refinery29 the company said in release.\n\nVice Media CEO Nancy Dubuc said the merger is a landmark moment for independent media worldwide and will improve the voices of both publication's young audiences.\n\n\"We will not allow a rapidly consolidating media ecosystem to constrict young people's choices or their ability to freely express themselves about the things they care about most,\" she said in the statement. \"At Vice and Refinery29, the megaphone is theirs to use and the platforms are theirs to build with us.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM", "description": "Vice made news with its purchase of Refinery 29, and could lead to big things for the cutting edge media company.", "authors": ["Jason Schott"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/vice-refinery-29-.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
