No one has ever found any evidence that Washington said it. In the next edition of the Yale Book of Quotations, barring any further discoveries, I will list it as a pseudo-Washingtonism, with the earliest known citation being [in 1902].\n\nI did some checking of my own, and the only sources I\u2019ve seen mentioned for the quote are Washington\u2019s \u201cFarewell Address\u201d (rarely) and the Jan. 14, 1790, Boston Independent Chronicle (more often). It\u2019s not in either. I\u2019ve checked the Independent Chronicle issue in an online database to which UCLA has a subscription, but the Washington speech printed there is this speech, which does not include the quote. (The citations I\u2019ve seen generally say that the Independent Chronicle issue reprinted a Jan. 7, 1790, speech; the speech in the Jan. 14, 1790, Boston Independent Chronicle is a Jan. 8, 1790, speech, but the first item in that article bears a Jan. 7, 1790, reference.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat\u2019s more, there was indeed a fire/servant/master phrase in common use in the 1700s, but it was \u201cfire is a good servant but a bad master.\u201d Our lawyer readers might be amused to know that Sir William Blackstone used that phrase in some commentaries on Shakespeare (who knew?), describing it as a proverb. (The same construction was also used about love, money, wine, imagination and other things.)\n\nGiven this, it would have been odd for someone to say \u201cLike fire it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master,\u201d with negative qualifiers both for servant and master, when the proverb had a positive for the servant but a negative for the master. Of course, the point of the proverb was that fire is indeed dangerous \u2014 but the dangerousness was conveyed by implication from \u201cbad master\u201d and was counterposed to the value stressed by \u201cgood servant.\u201d\n\nNow it\u2019s hard to prove that Washington never said this; but until I see a reliable source for it, I\u2019d be skeptical. I certainly wouldn\u2019t report the quote without noting at least that it might well be apocryphal, though I would go further and say that it is probably apocryphal.\n\nAD", "description": "It's often attributed to him, but there seems to be no solid evidence that he actually said it; and indeed, this seems to be a mangling of a related but different quote that was common around that era.", "authors": ["Eugene Volokh", "Contributor", "The Volokh Conspiracy"], "top_image": "https://washingtonpost.com/pf/resources/images/favicon.ico?d=120", "published_at": "2017-04-17"}
