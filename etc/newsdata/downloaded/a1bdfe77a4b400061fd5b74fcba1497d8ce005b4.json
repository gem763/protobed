How about \u00a36,000? Those are the sort of savings Daniel Gregorious, MG\u2019s sales and marketing director, claims customers can make by buying this new family SUV/crossover in preference to some artfully selected rivals including the Skoda Karoq, Mazda CX-5, Kia Sportage and Renault Kadjar.\n\nWith independent suspension all round, commodious seating for five adults, a raised ride height and all the camera- and radar-based safety systems you can find on the non-premium competition, on paper the MG HS is something of a bargain \u2013 especially so if you compare specifications. But is it?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s from a place beyond value for money, called affordable quality,\u201d says Gregorious, clearly delighted to have something to replace this car\u2019s lacklustre GS predecessor. Bless him, he was so excited at this new world of quality beyond the back of the cheap-and-cheerful wardrobe that he got carried away and announced that some HS models have remotely adjustable damping. They haven\u2019t.\n\nThe HS does have a fairly good specification, though, particularly on the \u00a323,540 Exclusive model we drove with LED lights, 18-inch diamond-cut wheels, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, satnav, a panoramic sunroof, leather upholstery, dual-zone aircon, remote central locking and rear parking sensors. Remember, however, that these are cash savings. Once the greater residual value of the rivals is taken into account, the monthly payments on the MG might not be quite so startling...\n\nIn a not particularly stylish class of cars, the MG isn\u2019t a letdown by any means. It\u2019s big and tall and though its huge grille has to grow on you a bit, in the \u00a3545 optional metallic red of the launch cars it wouldn\u2019t look out of place in a Waitrose supermarket car park.", "description": "Psst, do you want to save \u00a34,000?", "authors": ["Andrew English", "Motoring Correspondent", "Alex Robbins", "Ed Wiseman", "Charlotte Whitehead"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/images/2019/10/16/MG-HS-f34-action-main-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqMH_arYXdQ_fL7R8QTz-89TbYitWc8G3UR8FIxX69dvg.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
