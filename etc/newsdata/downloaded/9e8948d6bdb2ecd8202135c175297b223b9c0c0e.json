Customers who experience delays are encouraged to download the DDL at a later time,\" Service NSW wrote on its website.\n\nScreenshot: Asha Barbaschow/ZDNet\n\nIn attempting to add a digital version of their licence, users were presented with a message that read: \"We're a little busy. Many people are loading their digital licences right now Please try again\".\n\nThe capability follows the initial trial of the initiative in Dubbo in late 2017, which allowed participants to use their digital driver licence for proof-of-identity and proof-of-age to gain entry into pubs and clubs, as well as for roadside police checks.\n\nA metro trial of the digital driver licence then began in November 2018 across Sydney's Eastern Beaches, allowing more than 140,000 licence holders in the region to ditch the plastic identification card for the smartphone-rendered copy.\n\nThe government in late May then announced it had extended the trial to Albury in the state's south.\n\nEarlier this month, Service NSW chief digital and product officer Chris Fechner told ZDNet the state-wide rollout of digital driver licences was yet to be confirmed, due to the agency taking caution about releasing the capability before it was ready.\n\n\"The release date is a not a decision for me, but our focus has been to make that product as good as it can be, and make sure it works for people first time,\" he said.\n\n\"It's about understanding how it's going to be taken up, the usage model it's going to have, whether it's going to be for the right to drive, whether it's for identity services, who's going to use it, how we pick it up, but also the scalability.\"\n\nFechner said the main reason for this is because the digital driver licence is the \"highest risk item\" among the different digital licences that the NSW government plans to make available.\n\n\"So, making sure it's right is our biggest priority,\" he said.\n\nThe initial go-live date was promised to be after the state election, which took place on March 23. However, the state government said it was allowing for extra time to test Service NSW's online platforms.\n\nCitizens were then told during the NSW 2019-20 Budget that Service NSW was planning on rolling out digital driver's licences across the state in August.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE", "description": "Service NSW is advising customers to return to the app later to add a digital driver licence, as it was 'a little busy' on Tuesday morning.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/29/3b229e49-7b6c-485a-be2d-238c64c8b7b5/thumbnail/770x578/c1f315d74a6e7b88961b89bc3cf566f7/img-4975.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
