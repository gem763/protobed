Japanese courts have dismissed several appeals by Ghosn to ease those restrictions that his lawyers have argued violates Japan's constitution and international law on family separation.\n\nIn September, Ghosn and Nissan agreed to settle claims from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision over false financial disclosures related to Ghosn's compensation. Nissan agreed to pay $15 million, while Ghosn agreed to a $1 million civil penalty and a 10-year ban from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded U.S. company.\n\nCourts in Japan have yet to fix a schedule for his prosecution to begin, with local media reporting that his first trial may start in March. Ghosn's defence team of 13 lawyers includes four lawyers in Japan who will defend him in the upcoming trials.", "description": "The fillings say the case comes from unlawful collusion between the prosecutors, government officials and executives at Nissan Motor to drum up allegations of wrongdoing to remove him.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105862954-1555906581905gettyimages-1128826860.jpeg?v=1555906632", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
