(CBC)\n\n\"It is the federal government's discriminatory conduct that needs review and reform \u2014 not the legal decision that flagged the problem and ordered the discrimination to stop,\" she said.\n\nOttawa's application calls for an order setting aside the tribunal's decision and dismissing the claim for monetary compensation. In the absence of such an order, the federal government is asking for an order setting aside the tribunal's decision and referring the matter back to the tribunal for review in accordance with directions set by the Federal Court.\n\nThe federal government's application says Canada acknowledges the finding of systematic discrimination and does not oppose the general principle of compensating First Nations kids \u2014 but it argues the ruling was inconsistent with the nature of the complaint, the evidence, past jurisprudence and the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer said on Thursday that he would seek a judicial review if he was prime minister.\n\n\"This is a far-reaching decision that has major impacts on multiple levels of government,\" Scheer said.\n\n\"It would be appropriate to have a judicial review.\"\n\nScheer has not said specifically what a Conservative government would do with this file if it forms government after Oct. 21.\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and Green Party Leader Elizabeth May have both said they would offer compensation at the level ordered by the tribunal.\n\nTrudeau ducked questions Thursday when asked what a re-elected Liberal government would do.\n\n\"From the Sixties Scoop to the relocations, to the tuberculosis among the Inuit, we have always moved forward in a responsible way to compensate, to support people, and we will continue to do that as we move forward,\" Trudeau said.\n\n\"We're going to continue to work with Indigenous communities, work with Indigenous leaders, to make sure that there is proper compensation.\"\n\nNational Chief of the Assembly of First Nations Perry Bellegarde has called on every party leader to commit to honouring the ruling.\n\n\"This is about supporting First Nations children and families and respecting human rights,\" Bellegarde wrote in a tweet.\n\n\"It is unconscionable that anyone would oppose this.\"\n\nSome estimates place the number of potentially affected children at about 50,000, with the largest numbers in the Prairies and British Columbia. The ruling also covers First Nation children in the Yukon territory.\n\nBallot box issue\n\nMary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, a lawyer and former child and youth advocate for British Columbia, said she wants the party that forms the next government to work out a new path for First Nation children and families.\n\n\"The recognition that they deserve respect and support is long overdue,\" Turpel-Laford said. \"The time for fighting First Nation children and families is over.\"\n\nLiberal leader Justin Trudeau waves to supporters as he boards his campaign bus on October 1 in Richmond Hill, Ont. (Ryan Remiorz/Canadian Press)\n\nThe tribunal ordered Ottawa to enter discussions with the First Nations Family Caring Society and the Assembly of First Nations \u2014 which filed the initial human rights complaint in 2007 \u2014 to determine the best independent process to distribute the compensation and decide who qualifies.\n\nIt gave the parties until Dec. 10 to come to the tribunal with proposals.\n\nBlackstock said voters should consider where all political parties stand on the ruling when they head to the ballot box.\n\n\"I find Canadians really are wanting to see First Nation children being treated fairly and justly,\" Blackstock said.\n\n\"I think they're way out in front of the political parties in many ways on this.\"", "description": "The Liberal government has filed an application with the Federal Court to seek a judicial review of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal's decision on First Nation child welfare.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter", "Olivia Stefanovich Is A Senior Reporter For Cbc'S Parliamentary Bureau Based In Ottawa.
