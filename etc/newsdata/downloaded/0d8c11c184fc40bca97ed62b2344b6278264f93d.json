In 2018, after gaining weight over the course of three pregnancies she saw a picture of herself that inspired her to change. This is her weight loss story, as told to Yahoo Lifestyle.\n\nThe Turning Point\n\nAs a teenager, my weight started to creep up, but I was only about 15-20 pounds overweight. When I was pregnant with my son at 21, I remember weighing 136 pounds at my first ob-gyn appointment. They told me that I shouldn\u2019t gain much in my pregnancy. But I didn\u2019t listen, and with my second pregnancy (three years later), my starting weight was 154. Then, after having yet another baby, my weight just kept going up until I was 31 years old, had three kids, and was 75 pounds overweight. Throughout those years, I started and stopped dieting more times than I can count; every other week I was between a new diet plan and stuffing my face full of Oreos.\n\nMy turning point happened when I saw a picture of myself and it blew my mind. I knew I was heavier than I\u2019d like to be. I knew that I needed to lose some weight. But when I saw that picture of myself, I just knew I had to change. I was way bigger than I thought. So, I decided now is the time \u2014 I was done having kids, that chapter is closed, so now it\u2019s my time to take back my body. This was in October 2018, and I started gradually by eating a little less each day.\n\nThe Changes\n\nIt started with my mindset. I looked in the mirror and told myself that I was going to do it this time, that I wasn\u2019t going to lie to myself. I wasn\u2019t going to fail again. I needed to do this for me.\n\nI started slowly because I knew I needed this to last. I knew if I went in guns blazing it wouldn\u2019t last and I\u2019d fail, just like every other time before. Growing up, my dad was a personal trainer and he always ate healthy (still does). So I knew all the right things to do. I didn\u2019t want to do any fad diets, any weight loss plans, etc. I wanted to do it the old fashioned way \u2014 calories in, calories out. I am a busy homeschool mom of three, so I couldn\u2019t commit to an extended workout regime. I knew my success would come from mainly what I allowed into my body. So I\u2019d say 90 percent of my success has been from cutting calories to about 1,200. I ate three small meals and one snack per day. In the beginning, I definitely got hungry in between meals, so I would take a scoop of peanut butter or a handful of cashews to get through to the next meal.\n\nIt started out slowly, and I really didn\u2019t see much weight difference for a few months. But I just kept going and had faith that, eventually, I would get there.\n\nMy mindset really was the key factor \u2014 I often looked in the mirror and told myself that I\u2019m doing it, that I\u2019m going to be so proud of myself for not failing yet again, and told myself nothing tasted better than being healthy felt. You have to be strong enough to say no to things that aren\u2019t helping you reach your goals. As my clothes started to get big on me, I became so motivated. I went through my entire closet and took out all of my \u201cfat\u201d clothes and donated them. I vowed to never ever need those large sizes again. It was so freeing.\n\nTaylor Alexandra before her weight loss journey. (Photo: Taylor Alexandra) More\n\nThe After\n\nI feel so much better than I ever thought was possible. I knew I\u2019d be happier and healthier, but I had no clue how much life I was missing out on simply because I didn\u2019t want anyone to see me. That old friend who hasn\u2019t seen me in years? No way was I going to see her. But now, \u2018Yes, let\u2019s get together!\u2019 That pool party my kids were invited to? No way was I going to get in a bathing suit in front of anyone. But now, \u2018Yes, let\u2019s get our bathing suits on and head on over.\u2019 That family picture? \u2018Let\u2019s take it now!\u2019 I said no to so many things before because of my weight and how embarrassed I was to be seen. Now, I\u2019m up for everything.", "description": "After having three kids, Taylor Alexandra was 75 pounds overweight and was missing out on enjoying her life because she felt \"embarrassed\" about her body.
