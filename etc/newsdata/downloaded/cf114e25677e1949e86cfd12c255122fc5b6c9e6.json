REUTERS/Omar Sobhani\n\n\u201cPEOPLE WERE GIVEN WARNING\u201d\n\nIn a separate incident, a man on foot blew himself up in the centre of the capital Kabul, sending ambulances and Afghan forces rushing to the blast site.\n\n\u201cI was waiting at the entrance of the recruitment centre,\u201d said Mustafa Ghiasi, lying on a hospital bed after being wounded in the explosion. \u201cI was behind two men in line when suddenly the blast struck.\u201d\n\nTwenty-two people were killed, and 38 were wounded, said Rahimi, the interior ministry spokesman. Most of the dead were civilians, including women and children, though six were security force members.\n\nThe Taliban said it carried out the two attacks, and a statement issued by a spokesman for the insurgents said they were aimed at security forces.\n\n\u201cPeople were given warning,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cDo not take part in the puppet administration\u2019s election rallies, because all such gatherings are our military target,\u201d said the statement. \u201cIf, despite the warning, someone get hurt, they themselves are to blame.\u201d\n\nAddressing the Kabul attack, Afghanistan\u2019s president lashed out at the Taliban as the \u201ccoward enemy\u201d for targeting civilians.\n\n\u201cI offer my heartfelt condolences to victims of today\u2019s tragedies in Kabul and Parwan and pray for speedy recovery of those who were wounded,\u201d Ghani wrote on his official Twitter account. \u201cWe stand united in this hour of grief.\u201d\n\nPakistan, which denies accusations that it shelters the Taliban, also condemned the attack.\n\n\u201cWe offer our heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nSecurity at rallies across the country has been tight following threats by the Taliban to attack meetings and polling stations. The group has vowed to intensify clashes with Afghan and foreign forces to dissuade people from voting in the upcoming elections.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nLast week, peace talks between the United States and the Taliban collapsed. The two sides had been seeking to reach an accord on the withdrawal of thousands of American troops from Afghanistan in exchange for security guarantees from the insurgents.\n\nThe negotiations, which did not include the Afghan government, were intended as a prelude to wider peace negotiations to end more than more 40 years of war in Afghanistan.", "description": "Taliban suicide bombers killed 48 people in two separate attacks in Afghanistan on Tuesday, the deadliest taking place near an election rally by President Ashraf Ghani, though he was unhurt.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430889520&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G19H", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
