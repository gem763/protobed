REUTERS/Brian Snyder\n\nJane Buckingham, 51, received less than the six-month prison term that federal prosecutors in Boston sought after she admitted to paying $50,000 to have a corrupt test proctor secretly take the ACT college entrance exam on her son\u2019s behalf.\n\nU.S. District Judge Indira Talwani rejected a request by defense lawyers to sentence the author of \u201cThe Modern Girl\u2019s Guide to Motherhood\u201d to probation after noting other wealthy parents also received prison time for their roles in the scheme.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a serious crime,\u201d said Talwani, who also ordered Buckingham to pay a $40,000 fine.\n\nBuckingham is among 52 people charged with participating in a scheme in which wealthy parents conspired with a California college admissions consultant to use bribery and other forms of fraud to secure the admission of their children to top schools.\n\nWilliam \u201cRick\u201d Singer, the consultant, pleaded guilty in March to charges he facilitated cheating on college entrance exams and helped bribe sports coaches at universities to present his clients\u2019 children as fake athletic recruits.\n\nThe 35 parents charged since March include \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d star Felicity Huffman, who last week began serving a 14-day prison term after pleading guilty, and \u201cFull House\u201d star Lori Loughlin, who is fighting the charges.\n\nProsecutors said Buckingham, the founder of a successful marking firm in California, in 2018 paid Singer $50,000 to have an associate take the ACT entrance exam in place of her son in order to inflate the score.\n\nThe associate was Mark Riddell, a counselor at a Florida private school who has pleaded guilty to taking SAT and ACT college entrance exams in place of Singer\u2019s clients\u2019 children or correcting their answers while acting as a test proctor.\n\nIn court, Buckingham apologized for her conduct, saying \u201cnothing will ever make up for what I\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really want to apologize to the families and children who didn\u2019t have the advantages we did,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was wrong, and it was unfair.\u201d", "description": "A marketing executive who authored a parenting advice book was sentenced on Wednesday to three weeks in prison for taking part in a vast U.S. college admissions cheating and fraud scheme in order to help her son gain an unfair advantage.", "authors": ["Nate Raymond", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444265590&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M22F", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
