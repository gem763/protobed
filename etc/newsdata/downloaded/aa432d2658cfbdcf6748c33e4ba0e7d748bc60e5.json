At a project affiliated with the biennial, at the Despar Teatro Italia, she sat at a re-creation of the Oval Office\u2019s Resolute Desk and reread some of her now-infamous emails, which had been stored on a private server, leading many to question her ability to serve as President. (At the time, she was running as a Democratic candidate in the 2016 U.S. election. Her emails subsequently became a sticking point for Republican politicians.) It was one of those rare moments when art and life blurred so fully, it grew hard to tell which was which.\n\nThat project, created by artist and poet Kenneth Goldsmith, was titled HILLARY: The Hillary Clinton Emails (2019). For the piece, Goldsmith printed out all 62,000 pages of Clinton\u2019s controversial emails as readymade artworks. Clinton\u2019s tweet about the experience of seeing the piece cheekily reads: \u201cFound my emails at the Venice Biennale. Someone alert the House GOP.\u201d\n\nMore from Robb Report\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing\u2014it completed the circle, in a way,\u201d Goldsmith told ARTnews in a phone conversation.\n\nAccording to Goldsmith, Clinton was on a trip through Italy with friends of hers from high school when one of them suggested she go and see the piece. \u201cIt has her almost become an actor within my tableau,\u201d he said of Clinton\u2019s visit. \u201cIt was unbelievable.\u201d According to Goldsmith, Clinton sat down at the desk for nearly an hour, flipping through the fabled emails.\n\nFound my emails at the Venice Biennale.

It\u2019s a way of sort of reconciling Trump\u2019s sense of this information with reality. Sculpture does this really well. There\u2019s no more misinformation once you materialize something.\u201d\n\nThis wasn\u2019t Goldsmith\u2019s first time interacting with a White House regular. In 2014, President Barack Obama invited him to come by and read some of his abstract, often avant-garde poetry. Though this brush with the political elite was far less expected, \u201cI didn\u2019t believe it at first. I thought I was being trolled,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an interview with an Italian news outlet, Clinton remarked of the experience, \u201cThis exhibition is further proof that nothing wrong or controversial can be found on these emails. It makes them accessible to everyone and allows everyone to read them.\u201d Though perhaps they might not even want to, as she followed up, \u201cThey are just a bunch of boring emails.\u201d\n\nGoldsmith corroborated her claim that the emails aren\u2019t as exciting as the media had made them out to be back during the election. He confessed that he couldn\u2019t get through them all.\n\n\u201cI kind of wondered what the fuss was about,\u201d he said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t jammed with thrilling tales of espionage, they didn\u2019t reveal any close secrets. Mostly, they were boring.\u201d\n\nSign up for Robb Report's Newsletter.
