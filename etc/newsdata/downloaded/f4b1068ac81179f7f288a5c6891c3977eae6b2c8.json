A four-day gap between matches is not unheard of given it happens on the British and Irish Lions tour, but it is one of the toughest asks in test rugby \u2013 not to mention the effect of coming off a brutal outing against a physical side like Tonga.\n\nYet the silver lining for England is that a nine-day gap follows the match until their clash with Argentina, meaning Jones may just choose to risk a few more players than he would normally knowing that they can have a few days of rest before kicking on into the Pumas week.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

First try was born out of his brute strength as he burst through a tackle attempt from Kalamafoni and carried two over the line with him.

Made a strong tackle on Tuitavake in the second half, but left the field with what looked like an injury soon after.

Ellis Genge\n\nGenge made a positive impression coming off the bench on Sunday, and with Mako Vunipola still a little bit off a return from injury, it makes sense to rotate Joe Marler with the Leicester loosehead.\n\n2. Luke Cowan-Dickie\n\nAnother who contributed well after coming on as a replacements, with the hooker running off the shoulder of Jonathan Joseph to score England\u2019s crucial fourth try against Tonga through fine support play. Deserves his chance in the No 2 jersey and is proving rather adept at test rugby.\n\n3. Dan Cole\n\nPrimed for his first start in a competitive match since last year\u2019s Six Nations as he should rotate with Kyle Sinckler.\n\n4. Joe Launchbury\n\nLeft out of the squad against Tonga, his selection appears to be one of the most obvious ones, having been held back to face the USA.\n\n5. George Kruis\n\nEnjoyed a brief cameo in the final quarter against Tonga and his experience around the set-piece will be needed if Jamie George is not starting at hooker.\n\n6. Lewis Ludlam\n\nAfter being involved in the opening match of the campaign, Ludlam looks set to be promoted to the starting line-up, having seriously impressed Eddie Jones since being brought into the side. His emergence also gives Tom Curry a welcome rest, given he will be crucial to England\u2019s hopes in the latter stages of the World Cup.\n\n7. Sam Underhill\n\nIt looks like Underhill will be the first name in the side to double-up, given he was removed early on in the Tonga victory despite enjoying a strong outing.\n\n8. Mark Wilson\n\nHaving started 10 England tests in a row, the time is right to give Billy Vunipola a breather, and providing Wilson is fully fit, we already know from last autumn that he is capable of filling the No 8 jersey.\n\n9. Willi Heinz\n\nAnother straightforward swap as he will dovetail with Ben Youngs throughout the tournament. His experience and calm persona will be helpful against the USA if they prove tough to break down.\n\n10. Henry Slade\n\nA surprise choice no doubt, but Slade is the recognised third-choice at fly-half and given that George Ford and Owen Farrell seem to be a settled partnership in the first team, it makes sense to give them both a breather. It would prove a risk, but it Slade is probably the most versatile player in the squad and can be trusted at 10 if needed. However, his selection is largely dependent on whether his knee injury proves serious or not.\n\n11. Joe Cokanasiga\n\nSurprisngly left out of the side against Tonga, Cokanasiga will get the opportunity to prove his worth against the USA in a game that could suit his attributes, given he should get time on the ball against players who physically do not match up to him in defence.\n\n12. Piers Francis\n\nThe selection of Francis is no longer such a gamble given how astutely he handled the two World Cup warm-ups against Wales. The Northampton back is proving he can handle himself on the big stage after a few years on the fringe of the squad, and by trusting him to do a job, Jones can give his captain Owen Farrell a good rest.\n\n13. Jonathan Joseph\n\nMade a really strong contribution against Tonga to set up the final try, and his defensive awareness in the 13 channel would put Slade and Francis at ease of having someone they can trust outside them.\n\n14. Anthony Watson\n\nIn a dream world, Watson would be taking a break this week. But we\u2019re yet to see if Jones fully trusts Ruaridh McConnochie after just 51 minutes against Italy, and it may be wiser to stick with the tried and tested Watson, given how he finished Sunday\u2019s game.\n\n15. Elliot Daly\n\nOne of the reliable faces in the squad who should have no problem doubling up, given he did so on the Lions tour. It would make sense to give him a shorter outing on Thursday given Slade can cover the 15 shirt if needed.\n\n16. Jamie George\n\nIt could be argued that Jack Singleton should feature on the bench, but again Jones does not seem committed to giving him an outing after giving the new Saracens signing just two minutes in the back row during their four warm up matches. As a result, George is likely to fill the berth on the bench, should it all go a bit pair-shaped.\n\n17. Joe Marler\n\nSet to swap places with Genge unless Vunipola makes a miraculous recovery.\n\n18. Kyle Sinckler\n\nA formality as Jones rotates the tightheads.\n\n19. Courtney Lawes\n\nReplaced on Sunday midway through the second half that could suggest he will be involved once again.\n\n20. Tom Curry\n\nThere\u2019s an argument that Billy Vunipola will be needed here to cover No 8, but Ludlam should be able to do a job in that role if needed and Curry can cover both sides of the back row.\n\n21. Ben Youngs\n\nIt looks unlikely that Jones will try the George Ford scrum-half experiment while Heinz and Youngs remain fit.\n\n22. George Ford\n\nReplaced in the victory over Tonga that suggests he\u2019ll be involved. The likelihood is that he will start the match and captain the side, but given him a bit of a breather would be smart given his importance going forward.\n\n23. Ruaridh McConnochie\n\nCould find himself in the starting line-up, but a place among the replacements appears more likely to ease him into the action.", "description": "England will look to make it two wins from two at the Rugby World Cup when they take on the United States on Thursday, just four days on from their opening victory over Tonga.
