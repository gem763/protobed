(Arctic National Wildlife Refuge/AP)\n\nThe Trump administration on Thursday said it would seek to open up the entire coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration, picking the most aggressive development option for an area long closed to drilling.\n\nIn filing a final environmental impact statement, the Interior Department\u2019s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) took a key step closer to holding an oil and gas lease sale for the nearly 1.6 million-acre coastal plain, which is part of the 19.3 million-acre ANWR.\n\nThe administration said its preferred plan would call for the construction of as many as four places for airstrips and well pads, 175 miles of roads, vertical supports for pipelines, a seawater-treatment plant and a barge landing and storage site.\n\nThe refuge \u2014 home to polar bears, wolves, migratory birds and the Porcupine caribou herd \u2014 has long been closed off to oil and gas exploration despite long-standing interest among members of the petroleum industry. Climate change has made the area more delicate as melting ice has driven threatened polar bears to spend more time in dens along the refuge\u2019s coastal plain.\n\nPresident Trump is dismissive of climate change, but the BLM conceded that it is having distinct effects on wildlife in the region. Although the report says there might be \u201cpositive effects on some species,\u201d such as geese, eiders, loons and swans, it also says there could possibly be \u201ccatastrophic consequences\u201d for birds as well as the extinction of 69 of the 157 bird species on the coastal plain over an 85-year period, according to an earlier report by Energy and Environment News.\n\nThe BLM also said certain species, such as the Beringia bearded seal, which is not considered threatened, would go extinct by 2095 as a result of climate change. Bearded seals depend heavily on sea ice.\n\nBut the agency, which law requires to divulge climate concerns, said \u201cthe large magnitude of climate change effects\u201d would be \u201clikely to overshadow smaller magnitude impacts of oil development.\u201d The extinction of scores of bird species could happen \u201cwith or without oil leasing and development.\u201d\n\n[Trump administration sees a 7-degree rise in global temperatures by 2100.]\n\nA controversial provision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 provided for opening up ANWR\u2019s coastal plain to drilling and ordered the administration to hold at least two lease sales within seven years.\n\nMargaret Everson, principal deputy director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said in a statement that the plan would \u201cprotect high-value wildlife habitats and important uses in this area, while advancing the President\u2019s agenda on energy independence.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental groups deplored the administration\u2019s move.\n\nDefenders of Wildlife issued a statement saying that the BLM\u2019s \u201cdestructive, unlawful plan would sell off one of America\u2019s last great wildlands to the highest bidder.\u201d\n\nJamie Rappaport Clark, president and chief executive of the nonprofit organization, called the administration\u2019s actions \u201ccategorically illegal\u201d and \u201cpresents an existential threat to threatened polar bears and is opposed by 70 percent of Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy opening the entire coastal plain to oil drilling, the Trump administration has ignored data showing likely impacts on wildlife including the Porcupine Caribou Herd and polar bears,\u201d said Lois Epstein, Arctic program director of the Wilderness Society. \u201cThe sprawl from oil activities in the coastal plain allowed under the Tax Act would devastate this ecologically sensitive landscape.\u201d\n\nAll three members of Alaska\u2019s congressional delegation, as well as Gov. Mike Dunleavy (R) and the American Petroleum Institute, hailed the administration\u2019s plan.\n\n[Juliet Eilperin on Post Reports: \u201cOn one level, they feel like they need to acknowledge that their operations are helping fuel climate change, in part because they don\u2019t want policies that are so out of synce with the science that they\u2019re going to be rejected by the courts.\u201d]\n\n\u201cThe Coastal Plain is a small portion of ANWR that has been identified for oil and natural gas exploration and the potential for safe and environmentally responsible energy development in this area is incredibly large and a key part of a long-term vision for U.S. energy security,\u201d API Vice President Erik Milito said in an email. \u201cResponsible access to the Arctic region is in our national security interest, with other nations like Russia, Canada and Norway already actively exploring the area.\u201d\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who wrote the provision instructing the Interior Department to hold lease sales there, said in a statement, \u201cI\u2019m hopeful we can now move to a lease sale in the very near future, just as Congress intended, so that we can continue to strengthen our economy, our energy security, and our long-term prosperity.\u201d\n\nDunleavy noted that every Alaska governor since 1980 has supported opening up the coastal plain \u201cto responsible resource development.\u201d\n\nIronically, some major oil companies that for years sought access to ANWR have packed up and left Alaska, leaving a handful of smaller independent firms that are expanding their drilling activities. Royal Dutch Shell suffered a blow when a $7 billion well in the Chukchi Sea came up dry. And last month, BP sold its Alaska assets in Prudhoe Bay to Hilcorp.\n\nConocoPhillips, which said that it did not oppose drilling in the refuge, said that it had not yet decided whether to bid on leases. The company, which has made new discoveries in the nearby National Petroleum Reserve\u2013Alaska to the west, said it was \u201cfocused on our projects\u201d there \u201cwhere we see tremendous potential.\u201d\n\n[Trump to open up Alaska\u2019s Tongass Forest to logging]\n\nSome Alaska Natives \u2014 including the Gwich\u2019in, who live outside the refuge but who rely on the Porcupine caribou herd that migrates through it \u2014 also decried the administration\u2019s move.\n\n\u201cThis document disrespects the Gwich\u2019in Nation and all people in the Arctic and world who suffer the impacts of climate change and nonstop exploitation, while formally scratching the backs of those who seek to desecrate land and dishonor human rights to fill their pockets,\u201d said Bernadette Demientieff, executive director of the Gwich\u2019in Steering Committee.\n\nThe BLM must hold 30 days of public comment before releasing a final record of decision, at which point the agency could hold a lease sale.\n\nThe agency\u2019s own official analysis indicated that drilling would affect native villages, including residents of Kaktovik, because they are the \u201cprimary users\u201d of the refuge. The 450-person village of Nuiqsut, the agency wrote, \u201ccould experience impacts on caribou, waterfowl, and fish harvests from development.\u201d\n\nMany residents in Kaktovik have endorsed the idea of drilling on the refuge, on the grounds that they would receive a share of royalties from any discoveries. In an interview in June, Joe Balash, who helped oversee the environmental impact statement as the Interior Department\u2019s assistant secretary for land and minerals management, said he was committed to opening the area up to energy exploration in part because it would provide these native Alaskans with a source of revenue.\n\nBalash recently joined the firm Oil Search less than a week after stepping down from Interior. It is unclear whether Oil Search, which is expanding its operations in the North Slope, will bid on the ANWR leases. It is developing an area closer to the nearby National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska.\n\nIn a show of opposition to the lease sale, House Democrats voted Thursday to reverse the provision of the 2017 Republican tax bill that opened the door to drilling in the refuge.\n\nRep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), lead sponsor of the measure, argued that the Arctic refuge is \u201csacred.\u201d Alaska\u2019s lone representative in Congress, Don Young (R), called it a \u201csham bill\u201d the people of his state do not want.\n\nThe bill passed in a 225-to-193 vote mostly along party lines, but it has virtually no chance of being taken up in the Senate.\n\nDino Grandoni contributed to this report.", "description": "Environmental groups are aghast, while the oil industry and Alaskan officials welcome the move.", "authors": ["Steven Mufson", "Reporter Covering The Business Of Climate Change", "Juliet Eilperin", "Reporter Covering Domestic Policy", "National Affairs", "Steven Mufson Covers The Business Of Climate Change.
