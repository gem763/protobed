Looking at the analytics, she said she gained 58,000 new subscribers from the video and saw a spike in views across her recently uploaded videos.\n\nBut the video didn't gain traction overnight. Church said most of the views came weeks after she originally posted it, and said the video only had 68,000 views after the first day.\n\n\"I really thought the video would get 100,000 views, not four million,\" she said. \"Once I saw that it hit a million, it honestly scared me.\" Church said the video hit about a million views a week after posting it. And overall, the response has been positive, she said.\n\n\"I was a little nervous people would be bitter about how much YouTubers make,\" she said. \"But, I think it shows that YouTubers don't always make a ton of money and it really depends on what kind of videos you're making.\"\n\nRead more: YouTube star Shelby Church breaks down how much money a video with 1 million views makes her\n\nYouTube creators can earn money through YouTube's Partner Program if they have at least 1,000 subscribers and at least 4,000 watch hours on their channel in the past year. This program allows them to monetize their channels with video ads placed by Google, and also through subscriptions and channel memberships. These ads make a certain amount of money depending on factors like a video's watch time, length, and viewer demographic.\n\nGenerally, Church said she makes her videos over 10 minutes long so that she can include more ads. Her video with 4.1 million views had four ads: one pre-roll ad before the video starts, two ads in the middle, and one at the end of the video.\n\nChurch said typically she earns more of her revenue from sponsored posts than from AdSense on YouTube. But August was the first month for her when she earned more from AdSense because of the amount of views she gained from the video.\n\nFor more on how to become a successful influencer, according to YouTube and Instagram stars, check out these Business Insider Prime posts:\n\nA 5-step guide to making the most money possible from YouTube video ads, with advice from top creators\n\nYouTube creator Natalie Barbu breaks down how much money she earns from a video with 100,000 views\n\nA YouTube creator explains how he made nearly $50,000 in ad revenue from one video, without millions of subscribers", "description": "YouTube creator Shelby Church, who has 1.3 million subscribers, explained how much she earned in Google AdSese revenue from her top video of all time.", "authors": ["Amanda Perelli"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7fca972e22af238d541074-480-240.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
