Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nA valuation below the $20 billion level that people familiar with the matter last week said the company was considering would be an even steeper drop from the $47 billion mark where We last raised private capital this year. The startup faces skepticism among potential public investors over its governance, business model and ability to turn a profit while continuing to grow. The latest potential cut comes at a time when IPO demand for companies with a path to profitability is surging and would be particularly painful for investors who have given or committed over $10 billion to the company since it was founded in 2010.\n\nPotential investors have been unnerved by co-founder and Chief Executive Adam Neumann \u2019s sales of hundreds of millions of dollars of his stock and loans of more than $740 million tied to his shares in the company, according to Wall Street Journal reports and regulatory filings. Mr. Neumann also controls a majority of the voting rights of the company and recently doubled the potency of his supervoting shares.\n\nSome investors have indicated interest in the IPO and it is possible the company will pull it off at a valuation of $20 billion or higher.\n\nShould We yank or postpone the IPO, it stands to miss out on nearly $10 billion needed to fund its ambitious but money-losing global-growth plans. The company was planning to raise $3 billion to $4 billion in the IPO and up to $6 billion in debt that is contingent on the IPO raising at least $3 billion.\n\nIf the IPO doesn\u2019t happen, the company will either need to find more cash or scale back its plans for further growth, according to people close to the company. One problem is that We has long been betting its main appeal to investors is its rapid growth, but that growth is fueled by ever-growing helpings of cash.\n\nWe primarily rents space through long-term leases, renovates it and then divides the offices and subleases them over the short term.\n\nThe company is continuing to talk to its biggest investor, SoftBank Group Corp., about whether the Japanese technology giant would put in additional capital through the IPO by buying a significant portion of the shares on offer or invest a chunk of money that would allow We to delay its IPO until 2020.\n\nThere is no guarantee SoftBank will ultimately choose to put more money into We. Some of the conglomerate\u2019s key investors have previously balked at doing so, people familiar with the matter have said. But SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son has said he expects to keep backing the company in the future.\n\nSince We unveiled its IPO papers last month, potential investors have raised concerns with the company and its underwriters about its steep losses, which amounted to $1.61 billion in 2018, as well as hundreds of millions of dollars of real-estate deals and past personal loans involving the firm and Mr. Neumann.\n\nA number of banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have committed to arranging $6 billion of debt for We when it goes public, contingent on the offering raising $3 billion.\n\nWhile the broader market has been largely receptive to newly public companies, investors have been wary of highly valued companies that have logged steep losses. Both Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. went public to weaker-than-expected demand and are now trading well below their IPO prices.\n\n\u2014Eliot Brown contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Maureen Farrell at maureen.farrell@wsj.com", "description": "The office-sharing company is eyeing a valuation below $20 billion amid investor skepticism.", "authors": ["Maureen Farrell", "Maureen.Farrell Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105125/social", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
