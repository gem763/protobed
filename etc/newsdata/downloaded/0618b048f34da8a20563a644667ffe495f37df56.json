I think it was his best game since he has been back from injury,\" Erasmus told reporters in Kobe on Sunday.\n\n\"The plan was always just to get him to the World Cup, to make sure the knee holds up.\n\n\"After that, we wanted to get him to play a full 80 minutes. He can do that now and his form is back to where it was, so to take him off the pitch would be like starting the process all over again. The more game-time he gets the better.\"\n\nErasmus said he would demand the same commitment and intensity that his side showed against the Italians.\n\n\"The team\u00b4s make-up is a bit different but we expect the same intensity in all four of our next games (if they make the final). One thing that will be vital going into the knockout stages is intensity and big moments.\n\n\"If these players don\u00b4t step up then they will fail to stay in the team. They know that and it will be one of the challenges for them.\"\n\nNew Zealand head Pool B with 14 points from three games, with South Africa and Italy both on 10. Canada and Namibia have yet to claim a point.\n\nDamian Willemse will start at full-back after flying in as an injury replacement for Jesse Kriel, while Elton Jantjies gets another run at fly-half after his poor showing in the 57-3 win over Namibia.\n\nCanada have made six changes from the side that lost 63-0 to New Zealand last time out, with an all-new front-row in props Hubert Buydens and Jake Ilnicki either side of hooker Andrew Quattrin, and the inclusion of lock Kyle Baillie, scrum-half Phil Mack and full-back Andrew Coe.\n\nWing DTH van der Merwe will make a Canadian record 15th World Cup appearance when he lines up against his native country.\n\n\"We are hugely respectful of the South African team. They and the All Blacks are probably the two best sides at the tournament,\" Canada assistant coach Huw Wiltshire said.\n\n\"Two things you can't defend against in rugby are speed and power, and both those countries have got it across their teams, across the park and across their whole squads.\"\n\nThe Boks and Canada have met twice before, including at the 1995 World Cup in what later became famously known as the 'Battle of Boet Erasmus'.\n\nCanadians Gareth Rees and Rod Snow, as well as South African James Dalton, were sent-off after a mass brawl as the Boks won 20-0 on their way to lifting the trophy.\n\n(Reporting By Nick Said; editing by Tony Lawrence)", "description": "By Nick SaidKOBE, Oct 6 (Reuters) - South Africa face one final hurdle in their bid for a Rugby World Cup quarter-final place but seem certain to brush aside...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
