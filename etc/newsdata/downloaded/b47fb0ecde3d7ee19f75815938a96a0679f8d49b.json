He\u2019s not played a lot so far but he\u2019ll get his minutes and he\u2019ll grow and develop.\n\n\u201cWe always know that in and around the box he\u2019s one of the best finishers we\u2019ve got. If you want to make it as a United player you have to handle the fans. Mason won us the game so we\u2019re pleased for him.\u201d\n\nUnited\u2019s glory years under former boss Alex Ferguson were built on a regular supply of talent from their youth system and Solskjaer is following a similar path to help the fallen giants become dominant again.\n\nThe Norwegian has not shied away from giving young players game time and continued his policy against the Kazakh champions with teenagers Angel Gomes and Tahith Chong also making their full debuts.\n\nBut it was Greenwood who stole the show and Marcus Rashford, another prodigy cementing his place in the squad, backed his strike partner to grow in stature.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been doing well since he joined the first team and there\u2019s 100% more to come from him. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s excited and everyone else is as well,\u201d the 21-year-old Rashford said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a surprise when the young ones come on and do well, because of their work ethic. They all keep improving since they\u2019ve come up with us.\u201d", "description": "Manchester United striker Mason Greenwood's first senior goal in the 1-0 Europa League win over Astana is early proof that the club were right to back the teenager after the departures of Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez, manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431841740&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J07F", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
