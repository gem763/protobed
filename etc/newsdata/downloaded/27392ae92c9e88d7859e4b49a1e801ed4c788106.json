The money is also used to cover operating costs including customer service, fraud detection, and quality control measurements. After paying out taxes and the required amount of premium income, the provider keeps the leftover as net income. That money goes into the provider\u2019s reserves.\n\nThe $22.6 million in refunds being paid to BlueCross customers this week are for medical losses below the 80% threshold that BlueCross failed to meet, representing 2.1% of its individual premiums and 0.4% of small group premiums.\n\nBlueCross began offering Tennessee\u2019s first statewide coverage plan under Obamacare, but it posted losses of more than $400 million in its first three years because of aggressive pricing by BlueCross and the federal program\u2019s unexpected costs. Thanks to a stabilizing market, company decisions, and changes to Obamacare, the provider has broken even after the original losses.\n\nThe rebates reflect adjusted premiums for medical coverage in 2018. They do not reflect how much each policyholder paid or other coverage areas, such as dental care.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "This insurance provider is paying out millions to shortchanged policy holders.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/health-insurance-grab.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
