This is compared to just seven per cent five years ago.\n\nThe family court data, analysed by Wilsons, a leading private client law firm, shows that this rise comes despite the overall number of adoptions falling.\n\nJacqueline Fitzgerald, Partner and Head of Family Law at Wilsons says: \u201cSame-sex couples are playing an increasingly important role in adopting children.\u201d\n\nPhoto posted on Instagram by Tom Daley on 14/02/18 of himself and his husband Dustin Lance Black Credit: ./Instagram More\n\n\u201cAs adoption rates fall overall, same-sex couples are taking on more responsibility in helping children \u2013 many of them vulnerable \u2013 find loving homes. As advances in science help heterosexual couples produce biological children, the demand for same-sex adoption is likely to increase.\u201d\n\n\u201cCelebrities have led the way in challenging and breaking down outdated perceptions of same-sex parenting that some in society have held for decades. Being part of the LGBT community, thankfully, is no longer considered a barrier to starting a family.\u201d\n\nThe shift in societal attitudes towards same-sex parenting has been helped by a number of high-profile same-sex parents, such as British Olympic diver, Tom Daley and his husband, Oscar-winning producer, Dustin Lance Black, who had a son through a surrogate in 2018.\n\nThe growing number of same-sex adoptions is helping to fill a gap left by the fall in the overall number of adoptions, which has dropped 37% in five years. In 2018/19 only 4,895 adoption orders were issued, down from 6,437 in 2013/14.\n\nMeanwhile, a total of 598 of 4,895 adoptions were by same-sex couples in 2018/19, compared to a total of 447 of 6,347 adoptions in 2013/14.\n\nNot only has the share of adoptions being carried out by same-sex couples increased over the past five years but research has shown that same-sex couples are more likely to adopt children who would usually be considered \u2018harder to place\u2019.\n\nThis includes children who are over the age of four and those who have been identified as having \u2018special needs\u2019, according to research by LGBT charity, New Family Social.", "description": "Same-sex couples are fuelling a rise in adoption rates, official figures show, as a charity claims that they are more willing to care for \u201charder to place\u201d children.", "authors": ["Gabriella Swerling"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aUBUafzM5nCcLjvZZjZa9Q--~B/aD02MjU7dz0xMDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/12d6eb9eb6a6bb899cf7b713d749fa96", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
