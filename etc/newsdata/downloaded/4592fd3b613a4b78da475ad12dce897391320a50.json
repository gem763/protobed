Federal prosecutors are asking a judge to sentence her to a month in jail. (Steven Senne/AP)\n\nFederal prosecutors are asking a judge to sentence actress Felicity Huffman to a month in jail for her role in a college admissions bribery scheme.\n\nHuffman pleaded guilty in May to fraud charges, admitting she paid $15,000 to have a test proctor correct her daughter\u2019s answers on an SAT college admission exam in an effort to boost her score. Huffman was one of 34 parents charged in a sweeping case that sparked outrage over the idea that wealthy people were seeking to buy access to elite colleges for their children.\n\nFifty-one people were charged in an investigation of the scheme, which included cheating on standardized tests and faking student profiles as recruited athletes, hoping to enhance prospects of being accepted at top schools. Dubbed by prosecutors as \u201cVarsity Blues,\u201d the college entrance scandal was orchestrated by an admissions consultant.\n\nIn federal court Friday in Boston, U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling\u2019s office urged a judge to sentence Huffman to one month of incarceration, 12 months of supervised release and a $20,000 fine.\n\n\u201cHer efforts weren\u2019t driven by need or desperation, but by a sense of entitlement, or at least moral cluelessness, facilitated by wealth and insularity,\u201d prosecutors wrote. \u201cMillions of parents send their kids to college every year. All of them care as much as she does about their children\u2019s fortunes. But they don\u2019t buy fake SAT scores and joke about it.\"\n\n[FBI accuses wealthy parents, including celebrities, in college-entrance bribery scheme]\n\nThey also wrote, \u201cHuffman also pursued this fraud despite the staggering advantages that she, and so her daughter, already enjoyed by virtue of Huffman\u2019s enormous wealth and fame,\u201d and that this \u201cwould harm some other student who would be denied admission because Huffman\u2019s daughter was admitted in his or her place, under false pretenses.\u201d\n\nThis spring, prosecutors had calculated that sentencing guidelines called for four to 10 months of incarceration for Huffman.\n\nIn court documents, Huffman pleaded for leniency, as did her husband, actor William H. Macy. Her attorneys asked for a sentence of probation and community service, citing her remorse and her explanation that she didn\u2019t care about her daughter going to an elite school. Her daughter wanted to be an actress. They said Huffman didn\u2019t want her daughter to be disqualified from consideration because of lackluster math scores. She wanted her daughter to be judged for her acting ability.\n\nHuffman had grown to trust her college admissions consultant over many months before he suggested the falsified testing, her attorneys argued, and her daughter\u2019s learning disabilities justified extra time on the exam.\n\n\u201cTo my utter shame,\u201d Huffman wrote, she agreed to cheat on one daughter\u2019s SAT exam, and considered it for a younger daughter, too. \u201cBut the decision haunted me terribly,\u201d she wrote, and she did not agree to pay for faked results for the younger child.\n\nHuffman wrote to the judge that she was not trying to excuse her actions. \u201cI know there is no justification for what I have done,\u201d she wrote.\n\nHuffman said she had broken the law, deceived the education community, \u201cbetrayed my daughter, and failed my family.\u201d When her daughter asked, with tears streaming down her face, why she hadn\u2019t believed in her, Huffman wrote, she realized she had no answer \u2014 she had compromised her daughter\u2019s future, her family and her own integrity.\n\nAn attorney for Huffman referred questions to spokesmen for the actress. The spokesmen did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n[Actress Felicity Huffman pleads guilty in college admissions scandal]\n\nMacy said their older daughter had paid the highest price for Huffman\u2019s actions; her heart was set on a school that, he noted, does not require SAT scores. After many auditions, she went for the final selection two days after her mother\u2019s arrest. The school withdrew the invitation to audition.\n\nIn his letter \u2014 by turn, confessional and deeply personal \u2014 Macy describes Huffman\u2019s path to motherhood, forged in determination and, sometimes, fear. \u201cWatching Felicity being a mother is a wonderful thing to see,\u201d the veteran actor writes.\n\n\u201cFelicity worried about raising our girls in Hollywood with working actors for parents, so we decided to keep them as far away from our business as possible,\u201d Macy wrote.\n\nHe hails his wife for \u201can amazing ability to 'see\u2019 our kids,\u201d saying she appreciates them for who they are.\n\nHe also describes the challenges Huffman confronted as a parent. \u201cBut motherhood has, from the very beginning, frightened Felicity and she has not carried being a mom easily,\u201d Macy wrote. \u201cShe\u2019s struggled to find the balance between what the experts say, and her common sense.\u201d\n\nHuffman is scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 13 in federal court in Boston.", "description": "Huffman was one of 34 parents charged in a sweeping case that sparked outrage over the idea that wealthy people were seeking to buy access to elite colleges for their children.", "authors": ["Susan Svrluga", "Reporter Covering Higher Education For The Grade Point Blog", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/B8jMWsfAvmWl092_MlL8pmJOkO8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7QI3RKTVUEI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
