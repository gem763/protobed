The Labour leader and his top team were branded 'f***ing mad' by one of his own backbenchers after he agreed to a December vote, saying he would be 'going out there to win'. He will order his party to back a rushed plan for a vote on or near December 9 later today, less than 24 hours after he told them to abstain on plans for a December 12 election. It puts him on a collision path with backbenchers who see the party languishing in the polls and fear that he is leading them to a disaster. The MP told MailOnline: 'They are f***ing mad. They think they are on the brink of a brave new Socialist dawn.' They added that the decision was 'proof that turkeys vote for Christmas'.\n\n'No one wants to do an election in December, it's going to be mega-tough and it's going to be one of the toughest elections we could ever do.'\n\nAs battle finally commenced:\n\nMr Johnson restored the Tory whip to ten MPs kicked out last month for opposing a No Deal Brexit;\n\nTory sources confirmed the PM's girlfriend Carrie Symonds will join him on the five-week campaign trail;\n\nBrexit Party chairman Richard Tice said Tory MPs were pleading with him not to field candidates against them;\n\nThe Government headed off opposition attempts to move the polling date to December 9 and give the vote to 16- and 17-year-olds and EU nationals;\n\nEU president Donald Tusk warned the latest Brexit extension 'may be the last';\n\nMore than 100 Labour MPs defied the whip and refused to vote for the election;\n\nPlaid Cymru said talks were under way on pacts between pro-Remain parties;\n\nTory sources said Mr Johnson would pledge to deliver Brexit by January.\n\nThe election breakthrough came after the Liberal Democrats and SNP broke ranks with Labour and backed an early poll in which they hope to benefit from Mr Corbyn's unpopularity with voters.\n\nBut election experts yesterday warned a 2019 vote \u2013 the third General Election in four years \u2013 was likely to be the most unpredictable thanks to the prevalence of smaller parties.\n\nThe likely manifestos for Boris Johnson's Tories and Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party for the upcoming December 12 election\n\nOne said the election could result in a House of Commons with as many as 100 MPs from neither the Conservatives nor Labour, making it even harder for either of the main parties to win a majority \u2013 opening the door to a hung Parliament and yet further delay over Brexit.\n\nWill Boris Johnson switch to a safer seat? The PM faces a tough fight to hold his own constituency \u2013 leading to claims he could switch to a safer seat to avoid the risk of humiliation. Boris Johnson is MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, where he has a majority of just 5,034 over Labour. It would take a swing of just over 5 per cent to snatch the seat \u2013 and Corbynista group Momentum will target it with hundreds of volunteers. Their 'Unseat Boris' campaign would make Mr Johnson the first premier to lose his seat in an election in modern times. Labour claims he will announce in the next few days that he will take the 'chicken run' and stand for a seat with a much larger Tory majority. Downing Street described the rumours as 'tosh and nonsense'. Uxbridge in West London \u2013 traditionally true blue \u2013 has been represented by Mr Johnson since 2015. When he first stood, he clocked up a majority of 10,695. But this halved in Theresa May's disastrous election of 2017. Labour has chosen Ali Milani, a 25-year-old Muslim, as their candidate.\n\nThe study by Onward, a Right-leaning think-tank, said today's swing voter was no longer 'Worcester Woman' \u2013 seen as a key figure in Tony Blair's victory in 1997 \u2013 but 'Workington Man' \u2013 named after the town in Cumbria.\n\nHe is said to be a typically older, white, non-graduate voter living in rugby league towns in the North. This voter has lived in his home for more than ten years as either a council tenant or owner occupier. He favours security over freedom, thinks the economy and national culture is moving away from his views, and voted Leave.\n\nHe works in a skilled manual trade or in a lower managerial role and is likely to live in a town or rural area rather than a city. He is more supportive than most people of a strong leader who does not have to bother with Parliament.\n\nWorkington Man wants government to prioritise apprenticeships rather than cut the cost of student loans and thinks it should promote a shared sense of national identity over a diversity of identities.\n\nHe is more likely than the rest of the population to think crime is a major issue facing the country and twice as likely to think immigration is a major issue.\n\nHe is particularly sceptical about the benefits of globalisation and thinks we have a special responsibility to protect local institutions such as pubs and post offices from closure.\n\nOnward said without the support of Workington Man, a party cannot win a majority. The Labour-held constituency in which these characteristics are most common among voters is the Cumbrian town of Workington, making it the ultimate bellwether seat in the next election.\n\nWorkington is a long-standing Labour seat held by Sue Hayman, which voted Leave and has a 4,000 majority.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson leaving the House of Commons, London, after MPs voted by 438 to 20 to back a Bill enabling the election to take place on December 12\n\nMr Corbyn's sudden shift to back an election came less than 24 hours after he dismissed Mr Johnson's demand to go to the country to resolve the Brexit standoff\n\nWill Tanner, director of Onward, said: 'This election will be the most volatile in living memory and no party should be complacent. But it is clear that the Conservatives' path to victory runs through working-class rugby league towns like Workington, Warrington and Wigan, which usually do not give them a second thought \u2013 as well as the party's leafy heartlands in the South of England.'\n\nWorkington, Warrington and Wigan, which usually do not give them a second thought \u2013 as well as the party\u2019s leafy heartlands in the South of England.\u2019\n\nThe seven towns that were founding members of rugby\u2019s Super League \u2013 Castleford, Halifax, Oldham, St Helens, Warrington, Wigan, Workington \u2013 have returned only one Tory MP in every ten elections since 1918 and currently have a median Labour majority of 13,273.\n\nHow MPs voted: They decided the snap poll should happen on the government's preferred date of December 12 rather than the December 9\n\nMr Johnson had previously sought to get an election through a provision in the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act that allows an early poll only if it is backed by two thirds of MPs.\n\nThis effectively gave Labour a veto but the backing of the minor parties allowed Mr Johnson to sidestep Mr Corbyn and bring in legislation for an early election that required only a simple majority in the Commons.\n\nSensing defeat, the Labour leader yesterday performed a U-turn and told his MPs he was now backing an election less than 24 hours after ordering them to block one.\n\nMr Corbyn last night said Labour would launch 'the most ambitious and radical campaign for real change that our country has ever seen'.\n\nBut veteran Labour MP Barry Sheerman said it was 'sheer madness' to hold an early election.\n\nFellow Labour MP Kevan Jones said: 'I will not be backing an election under any circumstances \u2013 it's playing right into Boris Johnson's hands.' Another Labour MP said: 'It is mad that we are backing this. We are going to get stuffed.'\n\nLabour MPs made a last-ditch attempt to wreck the election bid by trying to extend the vote to EU nationals and 16- and 17-year-olds. Downing Street insisted there was not enough time to register millions of new voters.\n\nIn a significant intervention that could boost his hopes of succeeding John Bercow, deputy Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle ruled that the amendments should not be debated.\n\nDowning Street is confident that Mr Johnson can return a 'workable' majority in December, despite being foiled in his 'do or die' pledge to take Britain out of the EU by October 31.\n\nSenior Tories point to a run of opinion polls giving the Conservatives a double-digit lead. Polling also suggested that Mr Corbyn is the most unpopular opposition leader of all time.\n\nBut polling expert Sir John Curtice yesterday warned that Britain could be on course for another hung parliament, in what could be the most unpredictable election of modern times.\n\nProfessor Curtice said: 'I will make a prediction. There are going to be a record number of non-Conservative and non-Labour MPs as a result of this election. That makes it difficult for the Tories and Labour to win an overall majority.'\n\nWhat happened in the Commons last night? Boris Johnson put forward an election Bill to take the country to the polls before Christmas. The Bill received approval in principle at second reading, without a formal vote being needed. The House then now moved on to committee stage - where amendments were considered. Only one substantive change was chosen by Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle, after he dismissed others on handing the vote to 16-year-olds and EU nationals as out of scope. In the crunch vote of the night, the government's comfortably saw off a challenge to its preferred date of December 12. Opposition parties had tried to insist the election should be brought forward to December 9, partly because it is in university term time. The House then approved the final version of the Bill at third reading. The legislation will move to the Lords next, but few expect serious trouble in the Upper House.\n\nSome Tory MPs voiced disquiet at the decision to push for a snap election rather than pressing ahead with delivering Mr Johnson's new Brexit deal.\n\nSenior backbencher Simon Hoare said: 'What are we to say to constituents and others about the fact that we may be able to find time for a five- to six-week general election campaign and then the rigmarole of forming a Government and yet not for bringing back the Withdrawal Bill?'\n\nDamian Green, convenor of the One Nation group of Tory MPs, said the 'sensible course of action, which, frankly, voters on all sides would expect of us' was to press ahead with putting the deal into law rather than pushing for a general election.\n\nThe Prime Minister pledged that if he wins at the polls he will return immediately to the Commons to get his deal passed and end the 'dither and delay'.\n\nDowning Street said he would get Brexit done in January and devote 2020 to delivering his domestic agenda, including on schools, hospitals and policing.\n\nAmid rambunctious exchanges in the Commons yesterday, the PM began setting out his election pitch for voters.\n\nRehearsing his arguments ready for the campaign trail, Mr Johnson warned Labour is not interested in delivering Brexit. 'All they want to do is procrastinate,' he said. 'They don't want to deliver Brexit on October 31, on November 31, even on January 31.'\n\nHe added: 'They just want to spin it out forever, until the 12th of never. And when the 12th of never eventually comes around, they'll devise one of their complicated parliamentary procedures and move a motion for a further delay and a further extension then.'\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson arrives back at 10 Downing Street from the Houses of Parliament on Tuesday\n\nMr Johnson argued 'there is only one way to get Brexit done in the face of this unrelenting parliamentary obstructionism, this endless, wilful, fingers crossed, not-me-guv refusal to deliver on the mandate of the people and that is to refresh this Parliament and give the people a choice.'\n\nCrosby acolyte leading the election fight He is unknown outside Westminster, but 35-year-old Australian Isaac Levido will play a key role in Boris Johnson's campaign. A close confidant of fellow countryman Lynton Crosby, Mr Levido is director of politics and campaigning at Conservative Campaign Headquarters. He will be pivotal in decisions on how the Tories try to defeat Labour and win a majority. He is a protege of Sir Lynton, the electoral strategist known as the 'Wizard of Oz' who worked on Mr Johnson's two winning London mayoral campaigns. In 2015 and 2017, Mr Levido was in charge of Tory campaign messages. He recently served as the Australian Liberal Party's deputy director and was at the heart of the campaign that saw Scott Morrison clinch a surprise win. Under plans drawn up by Mr Levido, the Tories are targeting 50 swing seats and defending 50. He has told ministers he wants to secure a 'functional' majority. Privately, he has described Mr Johnson's 'fundamentals' as 'very positive'. 'The numbers are moving in the right direction,' he said.\n\nThe Prime Minister told MPs a General Election to deliver Brexit was necessary because 'delaying is becoming seriously damaging to the national interest'.\n\nHe added: 'The deal is there. It is ready to be approved by a new Parliament, with a Government yearning with every fibre of their being to be able to get on and deliver our One Nation Conservative agenda.'\n\nMr Johnson goaded Mr Corbyn for his repeated attempts to block a General Election before yesterday. 'He has called for an election 35 times in the last year alone. I have no idea why he has been so opposed to an election,' he said.\n\nHe compared Mr Corbyn to Goldilocks, joking: 'One offer is too hot, one's too cold. I hope he'll be able to stand up this afternoon and say this time, this offer of an election is just right.' The Labour leader tried to scupper Mr Johnson's plans for an early election by allowing 16 and 17-year-olds and EU nationals to vote, as well as calling for a public holiday on polling day.\n\nThe Government threatened to pull the early election legislation if any amendment to extend the franchise was passed. The PM's spokesman said: 'The election law on the franchise should not be changed days before the calling of a General Election.\n\n'There are long-standing conventions that election laws should only be changed after appropriate consultation. The Electoral Commission warns against changing electoral laws less than six months before an election.'\n\nBut none of the amendments to extend the franchise were even selected to be debated by MPs, and an amendment to change the date to December 9 was defeated.\n\nMPs voted in favour of the legislation for an early election on December 12 by 438 to 20.\n\nLate last night, Mr Johnson was greeted with a rapturous reception as he arrived at a 1922 Committee meeting.\n\nPM brings 10 Tory rebels back into the fold Boris Johnson has restored the Tory whip to 10 of the 21 former Conservative rebels who were expelled after backing a bid to block a No Deal Brexit. The Prime Minister met with the 10 MPs in his House of Commons office this evening as they were offered the chance to return to the Tory fold. All 10 accepted the PM's offer and will now be able to stand as Tory candidates at the forthcoming snap general election if they want to. The 10 who have had the Tory whip restored are: Alistair Burt, Caroline Nokes, Greg Clark, Sir Nicholas Soames, Ed Vaizey, Margot James, Richard Benyon, Stephen Hammond, Steve Brine and Richard Harrington. The remaining 11 rebels, including Philip Hammond and Ken Clarke, have not been welcomed back. However, a Tory source said that this evening's events do not mean that the remaining 11 will be permanently deprived of the whip as they suggested there could still be a way back for the PM's critics.\n\nTory MPs cheered and banged the table as he came in for the meeting in Parliament.\n\nTory backbencher Robert Halfon said Mr Johnson told MPs it was going to be an incredibly tough election for the Conservatives.\n\nAfter the meeting, Mr Halfon said: '[Mr Johnson] said we're going to take the fight to Corbyn on schools, hospitals and the police. We're going to take the fight to Corbyn on domestic issues.\n\n'Of course, he said we have to have an election because we've got to get Brexit done and Labour will mess it up... but it was a King Henry V to Agincourt-type speech \u2013 very inspirational.\n\n'He said it's going to be the toughest election. He said forget about the polls, forget about everything you read, this is going to be an incredibly tough election.\n\n'No one wants to do an election in December, it's going to be mega tough.'\n\nIt was claimed that, if Mr Johnson wins an election on December 12, he could ensure his Brexit deal is ratified by the Commons and Lords by the end of the following week and Britain could leave at the start of the new year.\n\nBut the deal would also have to be ratified by the European Parliament under the terms of the 'flextension'.\n\nThis would mean MEPs sitting for a special Christmas session before the end of the year.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn leaving the House of Commons, London, after MPs voted by 438 to 20 to back a Bill enabling the election to take place on December 12\n\nWhen asked if there could be an emergency sitting over Christmas to get Brexit over the line for December 31, a spokesman for European Parliament President David Sassoli said: 'The European Parliament is always ready. We will be ready.'\n\nBut a No 10 source conceded that if the Conservatives win the election then Brexit will likely not happen until 2020.\n\n'What the Conservatives will be promising if we win is that we will get Brexit done. We will immediately come back, we have a deal, we will be able to go to the European Council and get it ratified and get this done,' the source said.\n\nAsked if this meant departing the EU by the end of this year, the source added: 'Probably the start of January \u2013 but 2020 would be about our domestic priorities.'\n\nTriple threat for Boris Johnson: How the Tories could be caught in a three way squeeze by Lib Dems, Brexit Party and SNP hitting hopes of majority\n\nThe Liberal Democrats are confident of huge electoral gains after they backed a December poll to capture the Remain vote ahead of Brexit.\n\nThe party will target Remain-leaning seats in London and the South West as they try to pick up voters unhappy with Labour's divisions and Tories' commitment to leave the EU.\n\nLeader Jo Swinson backed the election after conceding that there was not enough support in Parliament to secure a second Brexit referendum.\n\nShe said that while she 'dearly wished' there were the numbers to back another referendum, an election was the next best way forward.\n\nJo Swinson's (left) Liberal Democrats will target Remain-leaning seats in London and the South West and Nicola Sturgeon\n\nNigel Farage, pictured with Anne Widdecombe, is ardently opposed to the Prime Minister's agreement with the EU\n\nShe now believes a Lib Dem surge can prevent the Prime Minister from forcing through a 'bad Brexit deal'. Last night, she said there was 'no limit' to the party's ambitions.\n\nThe Lib Dems' official election policy is to stop Brexit by revoking Article 50 if they win. Otherwise, they will continue the campaign for a second referendum.\n\nPlease do not stand in our seats Tory MPs urge Farage Tory MPs have begged the Brexit Party to stand aside in their seats amid fears it could split the vote, the party's chairman has claimed. Richard Tice said he had received 'numerous' pleas from Tory MPs. One texted him to warn that their seat could fall to the Remain-supporting Liberal Democrats in the election. They said that they were a Brexiteer and therefore should be spared, Mr Tice said. The Brexit Party is understood to have vetted 600 candidates and will field them in most seats across the country \u2013 except Northern Ireland. However, there have been calls from some Brexiteers for an informal electoral 'pact' between Nigel Farage's party and the Tories. Downing Street has so far rejected the idea. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme yesterday, Mr Tice urged the Government to form an alliance with his party as soon as a General Election is called. He predicted that a 'Leave alliance' between Mr Farage and Boris Johnson would deliver a 'thumping election victory'. The MEP said: 'We have made a generous offer to the PM, that if you stand for a clean-break Brexit, we will stand down and not fight with your candidates.' However, he was reluctant to say whether Mr Farage's party would stand candidates if Mr Johnson campaigned during the election on the basis of his Brexit deal. He said: 'We will not negotiate live on air. We will negotiate with the Conservatives.' And although Mr Farage is ardently opposed to the Prime Minister's agreement with the EU, the party leader has also hinted that candidates might not stand in every seat in the next election. Asked if the party would place candidates in every constituency if Mr Johnson asks voters to back his new deal, Mr Farage said: 'We will discuss that over the next couple of days.'\n\nThe party is already polling well in Golders Green in north London, where Luciana Berger is standing, and hopes to pick up Richmond in south-west London and the Cities of London and Westminster which Chuka Umunna hopes to win.\n\nThey are also confident of taking seats in Oxfordshire and several in Scotland. The party is confident of winning at least 40 seats, and hopes to add 40 more, and 140 on top of that, on a very good night. The plan is known as the 40-40-140 strategy.\n\nIts main policies are to bring about proportional representation, so smaller parties are better represented, and to allow votes for 16-year-olds. The party has also called for reform of drugs laws, greater equality and environmental action.\n\nThe Lib Dems need an election before Brexit happens as their revoke policy would no longer apply after we have left.\n\nGoing to the polls at this point would also mean the Lib Dems can capitalise on Labour's division ahead of Brexit and Mr Johnson's failure to leave by October 31.\n\nLabour is split between its Leave-backing heartlands in the North, the Midlands and Wales, and its younger Remain-backing voters in big city centres.\n\nIt has therefore adopted a fudged position, calling for a second referendum on a deal that it has pledged to negotiate.\n\nBut after Brexit, the party will be able to get back to domestic issues, which it claims helped it do better than expected in 2017.\n\nSpeaking in Parliament yesterday, Miss Swinson acknowledged that due to a lack of support for a second referendum, an election was the next best outcome.\n\n'We need to see the path forward, and if it is not going to be through a People's Vote, if there is not the support for a People's Vote in this Parliament, then we need to look at the other way to do that, and right now that is through having a General Election,' she said.\n\n'We have to act, we cannot just wait, because my fear is that either the Government pushes ahead with their Withdrawal Bill and it is delivered and delivers Brexit on the back of Labour votes, or that we end up in January, a couple of weeks away from the deadline of crashing out without a deal, and find ourselves in the same precarious position.\n\nBut that time the EU says, 'I'm sorry we've extended, we've extended again, and we cannot keep doing so if you do not find a path to resolve this'.'\n\nYesterday, Miss Swinson confirmed that conversations were taking place with the Greens and Plaid Cymru for a Remain alliance, according to Sky.\n\nShe said 'stop Brexit' candidates would be favoured in seats but added that the vast majority of seats will have a Lib Dem candidate.\n\nSecond referendum for Scottish independence 'will be at the heart of Nicola Sturgeon's SNP manifesto and any coalition dealings with Labour'\n\nNicola Sturgeon will put the SNP's push for a second independence referendum at the heart of her election campaign.\n\nThe first minister of Scotland said that her party's message would be 'clear, simple and unambiguous \u2013 vote SNP to demand independence and secure Scotland's right to choose'.\n\nThe Scottish nationalists are confident of picking up a string of seats from both Labour and the Conservatives.\n\nAt present they have 35 MPs \u2013 down from the 56 they picked up at the 2015 general election \u2013 their high water mark.\n\nIf Jeremy Corbyn fails to secure a Labour majority, it is likely he would be forced to ask the SNP for their support in propping up his government.\n\nThat means he may have to sign up for a second independence referendum in 2020 \u2013 six years after the last one. At her party conference in Aberdeen earlier this month, Miss Sturgeon was explicit that in the event of a hung parliament her party would make having another independence ballot an automatic condition for gaining the SNP's support.\n\nWhile she insisted her party would 'never put the Tories into power' her message to Mr Corbyn was: 'If you don't respect Scotland's right to choose our own future at a time of our own choosing, don't even bother picking up the phone'.\n\nMr Corbyn said on a recent trip north of the border that there would be 'no pacts with any other party'.\n\nYesterday the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford welcomed an election. He said: 'We on these benches are simply not prepared to sit back and allow Scotland to be taken out of the European Union against its will.\n\nSo on that basis, Mr Speaker, I welcome the opportunity of an election, because make no mistake, the election that's coming is going to be the right of Scotland to determine its own future.'\n\nEarlier he told BBC Scotland that if Brexit went ahead a referendum on independence would be an insurance policy 'making sure we stay in Europe'.\n\nHe added: 'We want to see Boris Johnson defeated and out of No 10.'", "description": "Boris Johnson promised voters a new parliament for Christmas last night as he finally secured a General Election that experts have predicted will be decided by the 'Workington Man.'", "authors": ["Jason Groves Political Editor For The Daily Mail", "John Stevens Deputy Political Editor For The Daily Mail", "Claire Ellicott Political Correspondent For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/01/20356470-0-image-a-12_1572400470795.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
