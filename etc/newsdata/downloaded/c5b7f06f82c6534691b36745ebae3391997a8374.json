MMA, as well as other opposition parties have been repeatedly accusing Khan of rigging last year\u2019s general elections and urging him to step down.\n\n\u201cThe current government is the result of a fake election and fake results,\u201d Rehman said during a press conference on Saturday.\n\nWhile the alleged electoral fraud has been on the table for the opposition for quite some time, the last straw was a meeting between Khan and the founder Open Society Foundation, billionaire George Soros on the sidelines of the UNGA late in September.\n\nThe meeting prompted a very angry reaction among Pakistani Islamists. Rehman accused Khan of being a \u201cJewish agent\u201d striving to turn the country into a puppet of foreign players.\n\n\u201cBy meeting that infamous Jew, [Khan] has made it clear that [his government] doesn\u2019t want to bring reforms in religious education. They want to make Pakistan's educational system subservient to the West,\u201d Rehman stated.\n\nThe Soros-Khan talks have sure come in handy for Rehman, as he has repeatedly accused Khan of having close ties to Jews \u2013 as well as the US \u2013 and declared in 2013 that voting for him was ultimately \u201charam\u201d (forbidden) for true Muslims. When asked for proof back then, however, Rehman said his own word was enough, since such a righteous man as he is would never speak ill of anybody.\n\nAlso on rt.com Pakistani PM faces backlash online after predicting \u2018bloodbath\u2019 in Kashmir & threatening India with nukes at UNGA\n\nSuch rhetoric has apparently fallen flat, as Khan secured a solid win during August 2018 elections. His party holds 156 seats in parliament, while five MMA parties combined have only 16 seats, and center-right conservative party the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) has 84 seats.\n\nSo far, the exact details of the upcoming \u2018Freedom March\u2019 protest have not been announced, yet media reports suggest it will be an all-men event, with the women being banned from attending it altogether.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
