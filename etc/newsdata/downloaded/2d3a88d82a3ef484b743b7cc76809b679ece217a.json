To further open up the capital account is a \"must\" for the globalization of Chinese economy, although this process may bring pressure and risks of capital outflows, said Wang Jiang, a professor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nAs one of the priorities, China can introduce investment products based on global capital market indices, such as the S&P 500, for domestic households, said Wang.", "description": "Deepening reform and opening-up, with international coordination, has been called for by Chinese scholars to reduce conflicts amid the China-US trade tensions, which can boost economic development on both sides, said a report issued on Tuesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/30/5db8debba310cf3e97a37cbb.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
