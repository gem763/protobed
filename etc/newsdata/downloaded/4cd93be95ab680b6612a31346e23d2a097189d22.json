In recent weeks, headlines dealing with a breakdown in momentum stocks, lack of progress on China trade, boom and bust in bonds, interest rate cuts, spike in oil and weak economic reports have all failed to deliver the sucker punch to the bulls that the \"Big Picture Bears\" have been anticipated.\n\nThe bears thought they had a better chance Wednesday, after the Democrats rushed to start impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump over a phone call to the President of Ukraine. The market shrugged once the details of the call were released and ignored the spin wars that followed.\n\nWithout the sell catalyst gaining traction, market players had little choice, but to do some buying instead. Rather than a \"sell the bad news\" reaction that many anticipated, we had a \"buy the no news\" reaction instead.\n\nMarket players have been cautious lately, as they have dealt with a steady diet of negative news and that has created some buying power on the sidelines. The technical conditions favor the bulls, primarily because sentiment has been running too negative recently.\n\nWhile it was a solid day of gains, it remains a very problematic market for stock pickers. The recent action has not created good technical action, and there is some major weakness in the high beat, momentum names. The rotation that hit many of these stocks two weeks ago reversed briefly, but the selling pressure has picked up again. The stocks that were the biggest winners a month or so ago are now performing the worst.\n\nThe political battles will continue to dominate the news headlines, but the action Wednesday makes it pretty clear that there is nothing new there for the market to worry about. China trade, the Fed and the economy remain the primary drivers and none of those issues are producing sustained movement at this time.\n\nOverall, the indexes are in good shape, but it is a very tough trading market.\n\nHave a good evening. I'll see you Thursday.", "description": "Rather than seeing a 'sell the bad news' reaction that many expected for Wednesday, we had a 'buy the no news' reaction instead.", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "No News Is Good News For The Market", "Rather Than Seeing A 'Sell The Bad News' Reaction That Many Anticipated For Wednesday", "We Had A 'Buy The No News' Reaction Instead.", "Jim Cramer", "Bruce Kamich", "Peter Tchir", "Gary Berman", "Carolyn Boroden"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/d6f60b16-cdee-11e9-848d-2d179648d2b7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
