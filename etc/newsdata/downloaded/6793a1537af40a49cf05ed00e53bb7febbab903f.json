Downing Street said the strikes were conducted using drones and cruise missiles.\n\nAs he jetted across the Atlantic to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Johnson also left the door open to sending troops to Saudi Arabia to help defend its facilities \u2014 although he insisted the U.K. wants to \u201cde-escalate tensions in the Gulf region.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will consider in what way we could be useful if asked \u2014 depending on what the exact plan is,\u201d he said, adding the U.K. would consider any requests for help from Saudi Arabia and the U.S.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has already laid the blame for the attacks on Iran and is sending troops to assist Riyadh with air and missile defense.\n\nJohnson said he is set to hold talks with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday, on the fringes of the U.N. summit. The meeting will come just hours after face-to-face talks with Trump.\n\nHe also told journalists on the RAF Voyager plane that hammering out an international response to the attack would be a core focus of his efforts at the global summit.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants to try to do what they can to bring the world together in response to what happened in Saudi Arabia in our management of Iran,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe difficulty is how do we organize an appropriate response \u2026 We\u2019ll be working with our American friends and our European friends to construct a response that tries to de-escalate tensions in the Gulf region.\u201d\n\nHe will also discuss the response today with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nA senior U.K. government official said a claim by Houthi rebels in Yemen that they were behind the Aramco attack was \u201cimplausible.\u201d\n\n\u201cImagery from the site of the attack shows the remnants of Iranian-made land-attack cruise missiles and the scale of sophistication and range of the attack is inconsistent with the Houthis\u2019 capability,\u201d the official said.\n\nThey added: \u201cThe sophistication points very firmly to Iranian involvement. It\u2019s implausible that it wouldn\u2019t have been authorized by the Iranian regime.\u201d", "description": "UK PM says London would \u2018consider\u2019 any requests for military assistance from Saudi Arabia and the US.", "authors": ["Emilio Casalicchio"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1169762422-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
