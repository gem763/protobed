David Perdue (R-Ga.) likened Romney to a fan who boos a quarterback when the going gets tough.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awfully easy to sit in the stands and be critical of the people on the field,\u201d Perdue told reporters Tuesday when asked about Romney\u2019s critical statements and speeches about Trump and his policy decisions.\n\nPerdue also bristled at the idea that Romney is giving voice to feelings that other GOP lawmakers share but are afraid to acknowledge because they don\u2019t want to get smacked down by Trump on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all quite capable of having a voice,\u201d Perdue said, dismissing the idea that Romney\u2019s critiques might embolden other GOP senators to speak out. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t see that as encouraging or discouraging anybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s his own opinion. I disagree with it strongly,\u201d Perdue said of Romney\u2019s criticisms of Trump.\n\nAt the same time, Perdue, a former CEO, expressed admiration for Romney\u2019s professional accomplishments from his time as a businessman and later governor of Massachusetts.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an ex-governor, he\u2019s a United States senator, he\u2019s a business guy. He can bring a lot to us in our effort to try to fix the budget,\u201d Perdue said. \u201cHe can help us continue this effort to grow the economy.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s debatable whether Romney\u2019s criticisms of Trump are changing opinion within the Senate Republican conference, what\u2019s clear is that Trump finds them frustrating.\n\nThe president complained at a Cabinet meeting Monday that GOP lawmakers aren\u2019t doing enough to defend him from the House Democratic impeachment push, and singled out Romney for undermining him.\n\nTrump complained that Democrats are formidable because \u201cthey\u2019re vicious and they stick together.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have Mitt Romney in their midst. They don\u2019t have people like that,\u201d he added.\n\nAsked if Trump was right to say that Romney is undercutting him, Sen. Ron Johnson Ronald (Ron) Harold JohnsonAmbassador Gordon Sondland arrives on Capitol Hill for testimony in impeachment inquiry GOP cautions Graham against hauling Biden before Senate Sondland could provide more clues on Ukraine controversy MORE (R-Wis.) responded bluntly: \u201cHe\u2019s not helping him.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans say they wish Romney would focus more on policy and less on challenging Trump.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got the respect by virtue of the fact that he was the nominee back in 2012, but coming into the Senate and being very independent and being the one that everyone looks to as the voice to criticize Trump, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very helpful to forwarding the Republican agenda,\u201d said Brian Darling, a GOP strategist and former Senate aide.\n\n\u201cI wish he would focus a little bit more on policy,\u201d he said.\n\nA Republican senator who requested anonymity to comment frankly on perceptions of Romney within the conference said colleagues weren\u2019t happy that he said GOP lawmakers don\u2019t want to stand up to Trump because they want to preserve their power.\n\n\u201cWhat people are annoyed by is when he speaks for other senators and says why they\u2019re not standing up to Trump,\u201d said the GOP senator. \u201cHe should stick to speaking for himself and not other people.\u201d\n\nRomney told \u201cAxios on HBO\u201d that Republican lawmakers refrain from criticizing Trump because \u201cpeople want to hang onto their job.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no upside in going on out and attacking the leader of your party, \u2019cause that\u2019s just gonna let someone come in and primary you on the right,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said fellow Republican lawmakers \u201cdon\u2019t want to do something which makes it more likely for [Sen.] Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenSaagar Enjeti questions Warren's authenticity on 'Medicare for all' All-female panel to moderate November Democratic primary debate Ocasio-Cortez grills Zuckerberg over political ad policy MORE [D-Mass.] to become president or for us to lose the Senate.\u201d\n\nThe Republican senator said \u201cthat\u2019s where there\u2019s frustration\u201d in the GOP conference over Romney\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also some talk that he\u2019s bitter,\u201d the lawmaker added, referring to Romney\u2019s unsuccessful bids for president in 2008 and 2012.\n\nA second Republican senator who requested anonymity also took issue with Romney\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised he makes the statements he makes,\u201d said the lawmaker, who wondered whether Romney is happy in the Senate, where moving legislation can be a laborious process that tests one\u2019s patience.\n\nThe senator said Romney seems to want to have a higher profile than is typical for a freshman senator who ranks near the bottom of the chamber in seniority.\n\nRomney told The Hill on Tuesday that Republican colleagues don\u2019t complain to him directly.\n\n\u201cNot to me personally,\u201d he said when asked if he\u2019s gotten any pushback from fellow Republicans.\n\nWhen asked about Trump\u2019s complaint that he was being undermined, Romney said, \u201cHe\u2019s got his own perspective and expresses it openly.\u201d\n\nRomney\u2019s defenders dispute there\u2019s any lingering bitterness and note that he has praised Trump\u2019s performance in the 2016 election.\n\nAfter meeting with Trump for dinner shortly after winning the White House, Romney noted, \u201cIt\u2019s not easy winning. I know that myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe did something I tried to do and was unsuccessful in,\u201d Romney said.\n\n\u201cHe won the general election and he continues with a message of inclusion and bringing people together and his vision is something which obviously connected with the American people in a very powerful way,\u201d he said.\n\nRomney was said at the time to be a contender to serve as Trump\u2019s secretary of State, a reflection of his deep interest in foreign policy.\n\nThe dinner, however, was perceived by some in the media as merely an attempt by Trump to receive homage from a Republican elder statesman who adamantly opposed his candidacy during the 2016 primary.", "description": "Sen.
