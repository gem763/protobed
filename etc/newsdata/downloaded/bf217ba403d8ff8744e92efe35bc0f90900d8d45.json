I\u2019ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person,\u201d the prince said, before referencing his mother, who faced incredible levels of scrutiny from paparazzi. \u201cI lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\u201d\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe duchess, who is the only one involved in the claim though Harry made the statement Tuesday, is specifically pursuing legal action against Associated Newspapers, which owns the Mail on Sunday, over the \u201cmisuse of private information,\u201d according to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s official website.\n\nThe publication published a private letter earlier this year allegedly written by Meghan to her father, Thomas Markle.\n\nHarry said Tuesday the publication \u201cpurposely misled you by strategically omitting select paragraphs, specific sentences, and even singular words to mask the lies they had perpetuated for over a year.\u201d\n\nThe Mail on Sunday responded to the claim Tuesday, saying that it \u201cstands by the story it published and will be defending this case vigorously. Specifically, we categorically deny that the Duchess\u2019s letter was edited in any way that changed its meaning.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to HuffPost\u2019s Watching the Royals newsletter for all things Windsor (and beyond).", "description": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex both made speeches on their last day in South Africa.", "authors": ["Lifestyle Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d94b6502200005200dc53f9.jpeg?cache=fks1jh8gix&ops=1778_1000"}
