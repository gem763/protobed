Joining forces could allow resources to be spent on developing new technology such as electric cars, while cutting costs.\n\nPSA Group, which is 12 per cent-owned by the French government and bought Vauxhall in 2017, said the merger would create one of the 'world's principal automotive groups'.\n\nBut the Unite union described the talks as 'deeply unsettling' for Vauxhall's UK workers, including 1,100 at its Ellesmere Port plant in Cheshire, which has long faced closure.\n\nPSA Group's chief executive Carlos Tavares warned in June that it was prepared to pull the plug on the plant \u2013 which makes the Vauxhall Astra \u2013 if Brexit renders it unprofitable.\n\nUnite said it would be seeking an 'urgent, high-level meeting' with PSA. Unite national officer Des Quinn said: 'Merger talks combined with Brexit uncertainty are deeply unsettling for Vauxhall's UK workforce, which is one of the most efficient in Europe. If PSA wants to use a great British brand like Vauxhall to sell cars and vans in the UK, then it has to make them here in the UK.'\n\nAnalysts have warned job cuts are likely. The talks come after a proposed \u00a329 billion merger between Fiat Chrysler and French car maker Renault collapsed in June. Manufacturers have been looking at teaming up with rivals to enable them to cope better with the huge challenges facing the industry.", "description": "The Unite union described the talks as 'deeply unsettling' for Vauxhall's UK workers, including 1,100 at its Ellesmere Port plant in Cheshire, which has long faced closure.", "authors": ["James Salmon For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
