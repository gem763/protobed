They all take more than 50 percent of the vote among women voters. And they lead Trump by margins of 44 percentage points to 51 percentage points in Hennepin and Ramsey counties, the two most populous in the state.\n\nTrump runs competitively with or just ahead of Democrats in the Twin City suburbs and in the rural north and south. Klobuchar is the only Democratic candidate running even or ahead of Trump outside the Twin Cities.\n\nBut Minnesota has the longest unbroken streak of voting Democratic in presidential contests of any state in the nation. The last Republican to win its electoral votes was Richard Nixon, in 1972.\n\nThe Mason-Dixon poll, conducted October 14-16, surveyed 800 registered voters for a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.", "description": "A week after President Trump held a\u00a0big rally in Minneapolis, a new poll shows his campaign has a long way to go before it puts Minnesota in play in next year\u2019s general election.\u00a0The survey, conducted by Mason-Dix", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_092519getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
