This week, I\u2019ll talk about how you can use the laws of psychological distance to your advantage.\n\nI gave the example of a landscape painting, where things in the foreground appear large and clear, and things in the background are smaller and fuzzier, with far less detail. That\u2019s the way we naturally depict things in psychological space: Things that feel close take up more mental space and involve more detail, while things that feel far off are fuzzier, less formed, and contain fewer details. The technical term for this is construal level. High levels of construal are fuzzy and focus on the gist rather than the detail (while high-level takes the 1,000-foot view). Low levels of construal are clear and detailed as if looking at an object or event up close.\n\nNow imagine that landscape, but instead of the foreground being in-focus and the background fuzzy, imagine that it\u2019s the far-off that is in focus and the close-up that\u2019s blurred. When you look at that scene, where does your attention go? To the background, naturally. The clarity of the imagery tells your brain to focus on that area.\n\nVisual artists use these tricks of perspective to guide a viewer\u2019s attention. It turns out we can do a similar thing, mentally, to counter present bias.\n\nThe Good News\n\nResearchers have found that the relationship between psychological distance and construal level is bidirectional, meaning that if you change one, the other changes as well. In other words, if you add detail to your mental picture of something, it will feelcloser, psychologically. Likewise, if you blur or shrink your mental picture, it will feel further off.\n\n\n\nAdding details to your picture of the future can make that future feel closer, more likely, and more important than it did when it was a blur on the distant horizon. That can offset some of the effect of present bias. There\u2019s a case to be made for doing the opposite, too: mentally conjuring closer outcomes as if they were far off. I\u2019ll give you a couple of examples.\n\nUCLA professor Hal Hershfield and his colleagues have been studying the effects of psychological distance on savings. They have run experiments using MRIs, augmented reality, and age-progression software to study how thinking about our future-self can affect behavior. Evidence is piling up that suggests that the closer you feel to your future self, the more likely you are to make good long-term financial decisions.\n\nFor example, students who interacted with an age-progressed avatar of themselves had stronger saving intentions afterward than those who saw an avatar of their current self. I believe this experiment worked because seeing your own face aged in great detail shrinks the psychological distance between who you are today and who you imagine you will be in the future. When the picture of your future is close-up, detailed, and clear, you can\u2019t wave it away as easily as you can a far-off, vague image of an abstract idea like \u201cretirement\u201d or \u201cold age.\u201d By forcing a close, detailed view of your future, you impose a low-level construal, which your brain interprets as real, likely, and important.\n\nHere\u2019s another trick: Imagine your future in first-person. See out through the eyes of your future self, rather than imagining your future from the outside looking in. This trick of perspective helps reduce psychological distance, too. See it up close, in detail, and through your own eyes, and it will likely feel closer, more important, and you will naturally care about it more. This can offset the effects of present bias.\n\nThe Reverse Can Help, Too\n\nYou likely know what it\u2019s like to be \u201ctoo close\u201d to something to be objective. We talk often about putting distance between ourselves and a difficult problem in order to gain a better perspective. When emotions run high, we tend to make decisions with a \u201chot head\u201d instead of calmly considering our options. It turns out, there\u2019s a simple but effective mental trick to get perspective quickly: Talk to yourself in the third person. I know. It\u2019s weird.\n\n\n\nImagine you\u2019re upset with a colleague. They have stepped on your nerves for the last time. You\u2019re hot around the collar and ready to have it out. Instead of thinking, \u201cI am hopping mad, and totally justified in telling them off,\u201d you would say to yourself, \u201cMatt,\u201d (your name is Matt now), \u201cMatt is hopping mad and thinks he\u2019s justified in telling his colleague off.\u201d That little shift in perspective from first to third person puts a sliver of psychological distance between you and your angry self, allowing for just a bit more objectivity on the situation.\n\nWhat Does This Have To Do with Investing?\n\nEverything. Investing is emotional. There are the highs of great returns, the lows of losing, and all the emotions that go along with trying to choose where to put your money. We try to make it more rational, but we can\u2019t really escape the fact that what happens to our money happens to us.\n\n\n\nSo, whether you are antsy to get in on bitcoin or a long-awaited IPO, reeling from a serious loss that set you back a year, or impatient to see returns faster than those boring (but smart) exchange-traded funds will give you, psychological distance is playing a part in your mental cost-benefit analysis and you would be wise to use it to your advantage rather than let it lead you into a trap.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPerspective is not reality when it comes to weighing options, so be careful. Present bias magnifies the importance of the immediate when compared with the future, and it leads plenty of brilliant folks unwittingly down the wrong path. Learning to see the close-up through a third-person perspective can help you respond more coolly to otherwise emotionally heated situations. Likewise, bringing the far-off closer in your mind\u2019s eye, adding detail and seeing it through a first-person perspective can help you weigh the future more accurately.\n\n\n\nOur brains are amazing computing machines, but the physics of psychological space warps our ability to correctly view alternatives if they take place at different times. Training your mind\u2019s eye is not easy, but it is a simple way to make much better decisions for the long-run, and your future self will thank you when your financial dreams are realized.", "description": "Here\u2019s how you can use the laws of psychological distance to your advantage.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/blt3a549d0a392b28cd/5c76ba682b22f9f161d6fd1f/SarahNewcomb_1x1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
