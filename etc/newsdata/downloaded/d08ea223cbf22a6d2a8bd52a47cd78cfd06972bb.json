It is not easy for him and the team. He is devastated now and sad. We can maybe remember some similar situations in the past for players, and they came back.\n\n\u201cFor example, I was speaking with Hector Bellerin and he told how he received some criticism three years ago at the Emirates because people weren't happy with his performance, but he came back.\n\n(Image: Reuters)\n\n\u201cThe important thing is to transmit to people if they don't like you in one moment, to work to change that situation. I don't know how it will be in the future, I can only work in the present.\u201d\n\nEmery has spoken to Xhaka three times since Sunday's debacle, but he is still not prepared to say categorically whether his player would be stripped of the skipper's armband.\n\nThe Gunners boss has consulted director Josh Kroenke, son of Gunners owner Stan Kroenke, but he is only playing into the hands of the shooting gallery if he ducks the issue for much longer.\n\nEmery insisted: \u201cI do not want to speak about that \u2013 the first thing is to recover him (Xhaka).\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\u201cI spoke with him this morning but only about him, his personal moment. I don't need his apology because I know he is devastated. He is now very down and we need to support him.\n\n\u201cI know, and he knows, he was wrong, but the first thing is to raise him up again. Time will give us the information (if the supporters will forgive him after an apology) and he knows we are here for the supporters.\n\n\u201cHe has the condition to be captain - I decided that, the players respect that. He was wrong on Sunday and did not respond as a captain (should).\n\n\u201cIt is not easy for him and the team. We spoke Sunday night, yesterday and this morning. He trained normally with the group but he is devastated. He is sad about the situation.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n\u201cHis behaviour was perfect in training, with the group and the club, but really he knows he was wrong.\n\n\u201cHe feels sad inside, very deep. It's normal as a human being. Every player needs the supporters' support.\n\n\u201cBut he feels the supporters don't like him. We need to transmit a connection with them. In the last matches we connect, sometimes yes, sometimes no.\n\n\u201cWe need to be strong, to learn to play under pressure. The supporters are the most important (people) in our lives \u2013 if they are not there and behind us, there is no reason to play football.\n\n\u201cHe is down, but the most important thing now is to look after him and his family, and to recover our best Granit Xhaka.\n\n(Image: Arsenal FC via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cWe are responsible \u2013 me and the club. We know our responsibility is to help everybody, and also when making some mistakes to recognise it.\n\n\u201cOn Sunday, after the match, Josh Kroenke was also in the dressing room speaking with me. We were talking for 10 minutes about the situation, but all the time helping each other.\u201d\n\nXhaka, Calum Chambers and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang are among the players Emery has left at home for Wednesday night's League Cup tie at Liverpool .\n\nMesut Ozil, who has not featured in the last six matchday squads, is in the frame to make his first appearance in a month.\n\nArsenal predicted XI: Martinez; Bellerin, Holding, Mustafi, Kolasinac; Torreira, Willock; Saka, Martinelli, Smith-Rowe; Lacazette.", "description": "Xhaka was jeered when he was replaced against Crystal Palace on Sunday, and responded by telling home fans to \"f*** off\"", "authors": ["Mike Walters", "Image", "Arsenal Fc Via Getty Images", "Reuters", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20751142.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Arsenal-Training-Session.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
