This was the first that her fellow co-stars and even Bravo had heard of the news.\n\nBut while on Jenny McCarthy's SiriusXM radio show on Monday, Lesseps, 54, shared that she is 'relieved' of the star's quick exit that she's been apart of since 2008.\n\nSpeaking out: while on Jenny McCarthy's SiriusXM radio show on Monday, Luann de Lesseps shared that she is 'relieved' of the star's quick exit that she's been apart of since 2008\n\nBack then: Luanna and Bethenny Frankel pose together at the Gilt City Celebration for Bethenny's Skinnygirl cocktails back in October 2014\n\n'I was surprised and not surprised in a way because I think that she is in a relationship that I don't think she wants to bring around on the show,' she said during the interview about Frankel's post. Bethenny has been dating her boyfriend Paul Bernon since last year.\n\n'And I think that Bethenny is - I always say - she's a lot of fun, she can be really nasty, she's very funny. And those are the people you kind of get up for in the morning since they kind of challenge you, so in a weird way...'\n\nShe continued: 'You know, I always held my own with Bethenny. Her and I have always had this up-and-down kind of relationship, and she's not an easy person to manage. And I just feel like that's the part I'll kind of miss because it's kind of challenging. I found fun in it. I'll miss her, but at the same time, when you're around her, it's like walking on eggshells.'\n\nNot surprised: 'I was surprised and not surprised in a way because I think that she is in a relationship that I don't think she wants to bring around on the show,' she said during the interview about Frankel's post\n\nPosing: Luann and McCarthy smile at the SiriusXM Studios on Monday in New York City\n\nThat's when the tables turned and Luann asked Jenny how she felt about the abrupt news.\n\n'I mean, I would feel relieved as hell if I was a cast-member,' Jenny explained. 'I would be like, 'Oh, my God!' It's kind of like, in your childhood, when you were like, 'I never know what kind of mood my dad's gonna be in or my mom's gonna be in,' so you're walking on eggshells. I don't personally like to live in those types of environments. It's unhealthy. It's up, down, up, down.'\n\n'I think the whole cast is relieved in a way,' de Lesseps chirped up.\n\n'It also leaves breathing room for other women to shine and show their personalities, because a lot was Bethenny coming in and stealing the show. But guess what? She can't steal our show. This season is amazing, and I can't wait for everyone to see the new season. It's better than ever, so I'm excited.'\n\nLooking fab: Bethenny looked great in a white dress and black high heels while speaking at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit\n\nThings started to get juicy when the host asked Luann if there was a group chat between the housewives, to which the answer was yes.\n\n'It blew up because nobody knew!' she said of the chat after the announcement. 'It's like, 'Thank you so much for letting us know before you let the press know. It would've been nice.''\n\nShe then explained that it would have been 'appropriate' for the star to fill in the cast before she went to the media: 'As appropriate as it would've been for her to say, 'Look, your fianc\u00e9 is kissing somebody at a bar. I'm gonna tell you first before I tell everybody else and show it to people on national television.''\n\n'Bravo didn't know! Everything came out on Instagram,' she went on to say.\n\n'Hell of a way to leave a show that's been so good to her, 'cause let me tell you, when she tanked in her talk show, she came back with her tail between her legs to 'Housewives.' Don't forget.'", "description": "Luann de Lesseps isn't holding back when it comes to\u00a0Bethenny Frankel leaving The Real Housewives of New York.\nFrankel posted to her Instagram that she was leaving the show.", "authors": ["Shelslaughter At Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/18/20340720-0-image-a-58_1572372613791.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
