Elizabeth Keatinge has more. Buzz60\n\nKjara Smith, 30, dreamed of buying a home in Centennial Hills, a manicured Las Vegas suburb brimming with shops, restaurants and parks where she had been living with her aunt and other relatives.\n\nHer vision could have become reality several years ago, before area home prices skyrocketed. Instead, early this year, Smith lowered her sights and purchased a more modest home in a scruffy, older neighborhood in northeastern Las Vegas where crime is prevalent.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t ideal,\u201d she says, adding that she bought a burglar alarm and got a gun as a gift. \u201cFor right now, it\u2019s my starter home. I\u2019m making it work for what it is\u2026 I needed to find something to get in the game.\u201d\n\nThe sharp rise in home prices since the housing market bottomed in 2012 has made homes less affordable for most Americans, but the run-up has especially affected African Americans, like Smith, whose typical incomes have climbed more modestly.\n\nVaping crisis:Outbreak of lung illnesses threatens to ensnare Juul's lucrative marijuana sibling, Pax Labs\n\nKey tax deadline Oct. 15: Did you ask for a federal tax extension in April?\n\nMany African-American homebuyers are struggling to find affordable houses. (Photo: andresr, Getty Images)\n\nThe median-income black household could afford just 25% of U.S. homes on the market last year, down from 39% in 2012, according to data provided exclusively to USA TODAY by real estate brokerage Redfin and based on the 46 largest markets.\n\nBy contrast, median-income white households could afford 57% of homes for sale last year, down from 69% seven years ago.\n\nWhy more homes are out of reach\n\n\u201cAfrican Americans who haven\u2019t been able to buy a home since the recovery began have only seen prices rise further and further out of budget,\u201d says Daryl Fairweather, Redfin's chief economist.\n\nRedfin determined affordability based on the median incomes of white and black households and average mortgage rates of 3.35% in 2012 and 4.54% in 2018. The real estate firm assumed homebuyers make a 20% down payment, though many put down far less, a scenario that would further limit affordability.\n\nHome prices in the 46 major markets have jumped 70% since 2012 as the improving economy boosted demand, Redfin data shows. Also, builders largely have put up more expensive houses as they seek to offset rising land, labor and materials costs, Fairweather says. The scarcity of lower-priced starter homes has driven their prices higher.\n\n'29 crash redux?: The stock market crash of 1929 was 90 years ago. Could it happen again?\n\nThe trend has kept some African Americans from buying a home at all while nudging many others to less desirable neighborhoods or remote suburbs that mean longer commutes to work. It also has widened the wealth gap between white and black households, especially since a disproportionate share of black wealth is in homeownership, according to the Urban Institute.\n\n\u201cit will mean they have less housing wealth by the time they retire,\u201d says Jung Hyun Choi, a research associate at the Urban Institute.\n\nWhere black households struggle the most to afford homes\n\nOf the 46 largest markets Redfin tracked, the Las Vegas area experienced the most dramatic decline, with just 14.7% of homes affordable to the typical black household last year, down from 61.2% in 2012. Las Vegas area home prices have soared 81% over the past seven years, the most among the 46 metro areas.\n\nOrlando, Florida; Riverside, California and Phoenix, Arizona also notched big drops of at least 30 percentage points in the share of homes affordable to black people. Meanwhile, the California cities of San Jose, San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles are the most financially out of reach, with African Americans able to afford just 0.3% to 1.3% of homes in those markets.\n\nBlack unemployment reached an all-time low of 5.5% last month, though that\u2019s still well above the overall 3.5% U.S. jobless rate. Yet many black people are getting lower-paying jobs that don\u2019t allow them to boost their standard of living, according to a report this month by the Brookings Institution.\n\nNot so funny: Panera worker allegedly fired after viral TikTok clip 'exposing' frozen mac and cheese\n\nAnd while African Americans\u2019 income has risen, it hasn\u2019t kept pace with the climb in home prices \u2013 or white incomes. From 2012 to 2018, the median household income of black people increased 12.8% to $41,361, while the median income for white people rose 13.1% to $70,642, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making less and home prices are going up constantly,\u201d says Donnell Williams, owner of Destiny Realty in Morristown, New Jersey, and second vice president of the National Association of Real Estate Brokers, a trade group for black real estate professionals.\n\nBlack homeownership declines faster\n\nThe share of African Americans who own their homes fell from 43.8% in early 2012 to 40.6% in the second quarter, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. By contrast, the white homeownership rate has edged down slightly, from 73.5% to 73.1%. In 2004, during the housing boom, nearly half of black people owned their homes.\n\nThere are other factors besides income that have squeezed black people out of homeownership. From 2007 to 2009, nearly 8% of African Americans lost their homes to foreclosure, compared with 4.5% of whites, according to the Center for Responsible Lending. Many have been replenishing savings and repairing their credit, Williams says.\n\nMeanwhile, black people are less likely than white people to receive a gift from a friend or relative to help with the down payment and twice as likely to have student debt that could constrain their ability to obtain a mortgage, says Jessica Lautz, vice president of demographics and behavioral insights for the National Association of Realtors (NAR).\n\nAfrican Americans also have far lower credit scores than whites, a disparity that is more severely hindering homeownership now that mortgage lenders have tightened standards as the economy slows, Choi says. Yet such benchmarks may unfairly hurt blacks, who are less likely to have mainstream credit. She recommends that lenders place more emphasis on measures such as rental payment history.\n\nBesides lower homeownership, the Redfin data underscores that the growing disparity between home prices and black people's incomes is nudging African American buyers to cheaper homes in more marginal neighborhoods. That can mean less access to better jobs and high-quality schools for their children, Fairweather says. Black people bought a median-priced home of $210,000 last year, compared with $250,000 for whites, Lautz says.\n\nThat has compounded another problem. While the 1968 Fair Housing Act outlawed blatant discrimination, more subtle incidents of real estate agents steering black buyers away from mostly white neighborhoods have increased significantly since 1999, according to an NAR report.\n\nLas Vegas median prices soar\n\nSmith, the Las Vegas homebuyer, was looking for a house in the $180,000 to $189,000 range but found slim pickings in the area, where the median price has leaped from $159,000 to $289,000 since 2012.\n\nSo she bought a two-bedroom, two-story frame house for $167,000, making a 3% down payment through a Federal Housing Administration loan and receiving aid for half that cost through a federal program. She has spent a few thousand dollars more to replace damaged walls and fixtures.\n\nA patient accounts coordinator for a healthcare provider, Smith plans to upgrade to a better house after she earns a degree that will pave the way for a higher salary. But she worries that her home won\u2019t appreciate as much as units in better neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to sell in the area I live in,\u201d she says. Houses in segregated areas have not risen in value at the same pace as those in predominately white areas, according to the Center for American Progress.\n\nOthers have been edged out of homeownership. Naim Vandross, 26, of Newark, New Jersey, has been searching for a two- or three-family house for himself and his three-year-old daughter for eight months, with the aim of renting out a couple of the units to provide income. Vandross, a car service adviser, has been putting away $700 to $900 a month for a down payment. But with a price cap of $400,000, Vandross has lost out in bidding wars for five houses.\n\n\u201cIt gets stressful,\u201d says Vandross, who lives in a townhouse with his daughter, mother and siblings.
