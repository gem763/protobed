On the cusp between Millennial and Gen Z, I\u2019m a climate journalist who is sometimes mistaken for a young protestor at events \u2014 despite clearly wearing a press badge.\n\nThe truth is, I am a young person passionate about the environment, but it\u2019s been a while since I was a teenager, and even I when I was, I wasn\u2019t out on the streets like today\u2019s climate teens. I do, however, understand where they\u2019re coming from with their signs, ways of coping with what\u2019s happening, and deep desire for action. After all, we follow the same TikTok and Instagram accounts.\n\nThat\u2019s why I reached out to the person running @climemechange on Instagram. He\u2019s also a young adult working in a climate-relevant field, looking for a way to educate people about the realities of climate change without beating everyone over the head with facts we\u2019ve all heard before. You have to let yourself laugh at the absurdity of what\u2019s going on in the world. If you don\u2019t, where will you find the emotional wherewithal to take action?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some amazing irony in the fact that we\u2019re squabbling over all this stuff while the world is literally burning around us, and we can\u2019t get anybody to pay attention to it,\u201d he told me over the phone. \u201cYou know it\u2019s tragic, but there\u2019s some sort of comedy in it.\u201d\n\nI spoke with @climemechange, who asked to remain anonymous for professional reasons, both before and after last Friday\u2019s climate strike. Our conversation about climate apathy, how teens are cleverer than all of us, and using memes as a tool for advocacy is below, lightly edited for clarity and brevity.\n\n@climemechange: I kept landing on this subject that nobody could make the topic of climate change engaging or appealing to a wide audience. People had tried climate change related comedy and it always came off as either convoluted or condescending.\n\nIt\u2019s a complicated topic that\u2019s got a lot of boring, mundane science that you have to know in order to wrap your head around it. It\u2019s not exactly fun to learn about energy markets. And then once you wrap your head around climate change \u2014 the causes, the problems that it might create \u2014 it gets very depressing and anxiety inducing for a lot of people. There is a close tie between comedy and tragedy, and there\u2019s some amazing irony in the fact that we\u2019re squabbling over all this other stuff while the world is literally burning around us, and we can\u2019t get anybody to pay attention to it.\n\nGizmodo: You convey the hopelessness around some aspects of climate change, and how screwed we are in a lot of ways. But at the same time, you use that to educate people.\n\n@climemechange: I definitely have done more serious stuff in Instagram Stories where I\u2019ll say, \u201cDoes anybody have any questions about climate change?\u201d or I\u2019ll do an explainer on a certain topic. I think way back, I did one on the duck curve, which is an important thing to understand about solar energy.\n\nGizmodo: Who do you see as your audience? It doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re trying to change the hearts and minds of climate deniers.\n\n@climemechange: I\u2019m not out there trying to do that, even though I know I have a couple of times. But I actually don\u2019t pay much attention to people who are stomping their feet and not paying attention to the science. I think a much bigger problem than climate change denial is apathy or ignorance. [My account is] for getting the people that can say a million more things about the Avengers universe than our own universe, people who just simply don\u2019t know about what\u2019s going on and aren\u2019t thinking about it and making them a little bit more conscious of it.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even count the number of metal straw companies that have asked if they can buy an ad on my page that I\u2019ve said no to because I think it conveys the wrong message.\u201d\ufeff\n\nGizmodo: So much of that is trying to be relatable to a bunch of people.\n\n@climemechange: Absolutely. You want to get their foot in the door a little bit with something that they can relate to or something that they\u2019re familiar with. It takes me like 20 seconds to make a meme. I just take whatever is trending already on the Internet that day, and I change it slightly to be about climate change.\n\nIf you take stuff that people are already looking at, laughing at, and relating to, you can layer this subject over it in a way that makes them just think about it for two seconds while they\u2019re scrolling past another picture of their ex having fun without them. And if you can get them to think [about climate change] for those two seconds, that\u2019s two more seconds than they were thinking about it before. Maybe they\u2019ll even become somebody who\u2019s involved with making change here.\n\nGizmodo: Do you see this as climate activism or yourself as a climate activist?\n\n@climemechange: I mean, real-life me is all climate change, all the time. Activist is... I don\u2019t know if I define myself as an activist or not, but I do see this as a way to communicate the problem in a way that might get some more people involved.\n\nI\u2019ve been working with clean tech businesses and climate policy for quite some time now. I\u2019ve seen how climate change is treated both in terms of how people are looking at the problem, and how people are creating solutions at pretty high levels of business and government. I\u2019ve seen enough that I wanted to find a way to convey some of my learnings in a fun, relatable way to a wide audience.\n\nGizmodo: It\u2019s really refreshing to see how your memes don\u2019t put a big emphasis on individual choice and instead focus more on systemic issues. I feel like we\u2019re living in this ridiculous time in which a major part of the narrative is like, yeah your plastic straws are going to kill everything versus, you know, focusing on all of the bad things corporations do.\n\n@climemechange: I can\u2019t even count the number of metal straw companies that have asked if they can buy an ad on my page that I\u2019ve said no to because I think it conveys the wrong message. People kind of lose the forest looking at the trees sometimes with this issue, which is what the oil companies want you to be doing so that you ignore the much bigger problems happening at the system level.\n\nGizmodo: There are other climate-related memers I follow on Instagram that make really great, funny posts. It\u2019s this mix between them being like \u201csave the turtles! plastic straws are bad!\u201d and then realising climate action goes far beyond just that. I feel like I\u2019ve never seen teenagers do this kind of high-level thinking about climate change en-masse until now.\n\n@climemechange: But individual choice does matter. We all have the individual choice to organise and vote and raise our voices in a way that might move the needle in the right direction. That\u2019s by far the individual choice that if you\u2019re not making, you can\u2019t call yourself someone who cares about this issue.\n\nI don\u2019t want to give the corporate world a big hug about the environment because they\u2019re still messing up so much, but you\u2019re starting to see these steps of progress in the right direction that are only happening because they\u2019re fully aware that that will drive returns because they know that Millennials and Gen X and so forth care about these things when they\u2019re choosing a brand or a place to work. We\u2019re more conscious than any other prior generation about companies being socially good.\n\nIt\u2019s upsetting to see that no action is being taken at the federal level. But on the state level, holy smokes. You\u2019ve got like a dozen or more states at this point that have committed to going zero carbon in a pretty quick timeline. And again: That doesn\u2019t happen without people raising their voices.\n\n\u201c[Teenagers] are all so quick and witty, but at the same time again what they\u2019re doing is on a whole other level of really getting people to be serious about this too.\u201d\ufeff\n\nGizmodo: What was it like participating in the climate strike [two weeks ago]?\n\n@climemechange: It was beyond moving. To see hundreds of thousands of people out in the street mobilizing for climate action, and just to take a second to think and pause about the fact that the majority of it is being led by young people \u2014 some of them literally kids who have taken on this role of becoming adults earlier than they had anticipated to take the lead \u2014 was was just so moving.\n\nGizmodo: You posted on your Instagram Story a few days before the strike asking people to send you pictures of their signs if they used your memes. Did you get any?\n\n@climemechange: It was kind of surreal for me to see how many people were out there referencing something that I had done. There\u2019s definitely a fun spirit that teenagers all have for sure. I think they understand the power of using humour as a way to get people\u2019s attention, their sarcasm as a way to get people\u2019s attention.\n\nI mean look at what what Greta Thunberg did with her Twitter bio this week, basically subtweeting Trump after he posted something about her. They\u2019re all so quick and witty, but at the same time again what they\u2019re doing is on a whole other level of really getting people to be serious about this too.\n\nGizmodo: Were there any signs or memes that you wish you had made that you saw at the climate strike?\n\n@climemechange: There was one that I was like, this joke is better than any joke I\u2019ve ever made. And it was somebody with a sign that said something along the lines of \u201cSave the Planet Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s girlfriends need a future too.\u201d\n\nGizmodo: It\u2019s funny that you mention that sign \u2014 I saw a mix of people loving it and hating it, being like, I can\u2019t believe people are trivialising climate change in this ridiculous way. But Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s deep involvement in environmental causes is why it\u2019s such a sophisticated and effective joke.\n\n@climeme: Exactly, hats off to whoever wrote that.\n\nThe kids are alright. #ClimateStrike pic.twitter.com/pnDkeKmwXe \u2014 J \u039b M \u039e S (@jamesglynn) September 20, 2019\n\nGizmodo: You\u2019re not a teenager, but you\u2019re doing the internet stuff that teenagers do.\n\n@climemechange: Yeah, I\u2019m in an interesting position. I\u2019m an adult, but I\u2019m not that old. I\u2019m a young person, but I have real practical industry experience that makes me able to relate to both younger and older people. There was one mother who reached out to me saying that she was interested in getting her son to learn about climate change, and that my posts got his foot in the door to learn about it.\n\nThen there are students that have [reached out] said that they\u2019ve used them in presentations to their classes, and who said, \u201chey, what do I do about the fact that my teacher is a climate change denier?\u201d The point of making these easy-to-scroll-through posts is that they can get your attention for two seconds and maybe make you think a little bit more about it. And then in my stories and with other content I try to do the straight up educational stuff to get people to learn about a certain topic surrounding climate.\n\nGizmodo: What are some other good Instagram accounts, or any other good things you\u2019re seeing on social media that you think people should know about?\n\n@climemechange: Honestly I think the more important thing is to follow the activists, like Greta Thunberg, the Zero Hour people, and Alexandria Villase\u00f1or. There are some youth activists that have been raising their voices and making some amazing changes.\n\nAnd I think that, as adults, we need to be supporting these youth activists as much as possible. I can\u2019t remember a single person I ever encountered as a teenager who got as well-read and as knowledgeable and as bold as they have. And now these people are like, in the UN and talking to government officials and helping to make change.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a young adult like us or an older one, you need to be supporting these people like crazy because they deserve it for having made the sacrifices they\u2019re making, and for having the foresight of what their future could look like [if serious action isn\u2019t taken].", "description": "As a social editor and the youngest person in Gizmodo\u2019s U.S. team, our writers and editors frequently come to me with questions like \u201cWhat do The Youth want?\u201d and \u201cWhat is a VSCO girl?\u201d This has put me in a strange position as teens have yeeted themselves to the forefront of climate activism.
