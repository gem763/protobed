(AP) \u2014 The Latest on the Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway (all times local):\n\n1:55 p.m.\n\nErik Jones held off Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Kyle Busch over the final 50 laps to win the rain-delayed Southern 500 that ended Monday morning.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe 23-year-old Jones passed Kyle Larson for the lead at Darlington Raceway and held strong through a final series of green flag pit stops for his second career win \u2014 and his first since taking the summer event at Daytona in 2018.\n\nHeavy rains delayed the start of the race more than four hours. Things finally ended at close to 2 a.m., some eight hours after the event's scheduled start.\n\nBusch led the most laps at 118, despite starting from the back because of an engine switch. Busch looked like he'd end in second before hitting the wall on the next-to-last lap and dropping to third.\n\nLarson was second. Kevin Harvick was fourth and Brad Keselowski fifth.\n\nJones' win was the 13th this season for JGR and meant all four of Joe Gibbs racers has at least one victory.\n\n___\n\n1:15 a.m.\n\nDaniel Hemric's flat tire led to major crash that caught up seven drivers at the Southern 500, including seven-time NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson and Denny Hamlin, a four-time winner this season.\n\nKurt Busch, who won the opening stage at Darlington Raceway, was also part of the accident that came with less than 100 laps remaining at the rain-delayed race.\n\nJohnson was looking to make up ground in his chase for NASCAR's playoffs and had run in the top 10 much of the race.\n\nHamlin had won last time out at Bristol and figured to be a contender here, as well.\n\nErik Jones holds the lead with Kyle Larson second, Alex Bowman third and Kyle Busch fourth.\n\n___\n\n12:20 a.m.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Busch brothers have dominated the rain-delayed Southern 500, with Kyle winning the second stage after his brother Kurt took the opening stage at Darlington Raceway.\n\nKyle Busch started 33rd after his team swapped out engines Saturday. He rallied through the field in the first stage, then passed Kurt Busch in the pits in the stage break to take the lead.\n\nKurt Busch remained second. He was followed by Denny Hamlin, Erik Johnson and Kyle Larson.\n\nThe start of the Southern 500 was delayed more than four hours because of heavy rains in the next-to-last event of the NASCAR Cup Series' regular season.\n\n___\n\n11:15 p.m.\n\nKurt Busch has won the first stage of the Southern 500 on Sunday.\n\nJimmie Johnson finished second in the 100-lap stage at Darlington Raceway and Kyle Larson third. Kyle Busch, who began at the back of the field after changing an engine, rallied to fourth. Denny Hamlin was fifth with Chase Elliott in sixth.\n\nThe rest of the top 10 was defending race winner Brad Keselowski, Joey Logano, Martin Truex Jr. and Erik Jones.\n\nThe race was delayed more than four hours because of heavy rains at the track.\n\n___\n\n10:10 p.m.\n\nThe Southern 500 is finally underway at Darlington Raceway.\n\nThe NASCAR Cup Series race was delayed more than four hours due to heavy rains that hit the track right before the scheduled 6 p.m. start.\n\nRacers were called to their cars around 9:20 p.m. Once they rolled off pit road, drivers had several slow warm up laps as the driers that had been on the track worked to dry moisture in the pits.\n\nThe biggest worry, Kevin Harvick said, was that things were starting \"way past my bedtime.\"\n\nNASCAR said it took many factors into consideration when deciding to run, including a sold-out crowd at Darlington and the approach of Hurricane Dorian to South Carolina's coast.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster ordered evacuations for coastal counties earlier Sunday and that lanes of area roadways would be reversed for those leaving the seacoast.\n\n___\n\n8:45 p.m.\n\nThe rain has subsided and NASCAR is drying out Darlington Raceway to run the Southern 500 on Sunday night.\n\nNASCAR announced it had every intention to get the event underway and completed, despite heavy steady rains that delayed the 6 p.m. start.\n\nThere is no tentative time when the race is expected to begin yet, NASCAR said.\n\nLoud jet driers are circling the track for the third time Sunday. Rain about two hours before the scheduled start was cleared up and racers went through on-track introductions. But a short time before engines were to fire up, a heavier rain soaked the track for nearly two hours.\n\nThe Southern 500 is the next-to-last event in the Cup series regular season.\n\n___\n\n6:10 p.m.\n\nHeavy rain has delayed the start of the Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway.\n\nNASCAR officials had no time for a restart.\n\nAir drying machines had dried the surface after a rainstorm earlier in the afternoon. Drivers came out to their cars and it looked like the race would go under overcast skies. But a short time before the green flag was set to drop, strong storms sent crews covering up cars and racers carrying umbrellas as they went to wait out the weather.\n\n___\n\n3:50 p.m.\n\nIf you don't have a seat yet for the Southern 500, you're too late.\n\nTrack officials announced they had sold out all of the 47,000 reserved seats for Sunday night's event at Darlington Raceway.\n\nThe track dubbed \"Too Tough To Tame\" had come close in recent years to filling up but had always come up shy of a sellout.\n\nDarlington's last sellout was in 2008, the last of four straight years every ticket was sold when the race was run on Mother's Day weekend.\n\nThe race was a crown jewel of the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series when it was run on Labor Day weekend from its inception in 1950 until 2003. After 12 years of shifting on the NASCAR calendar from November to May to April, the Southern 500 moved back to Labor Day weekend, where it's become the sport's official throwback weekend.\n\n___\n\n2 p.m.\n\nNo one's been as hot as Denny Hamlin in NASCAR. He believes he can keep that going Sunday night in the Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway.\n\nHamlin has won four races this season, including two of the past five events. He captured the last NASCAR Cup Series race at Bristol two weeks ago and will start ninth here.\n\nHamlin looked like he had gone from last to first to capture the Xfinity race at Darlington on Saturday until NASCAR disqualified him because his car did not meet ride-height guidelines.\n\nDefending Southern 500 champion Brad Keselowski starts second next to pole sitter William Byron.\n\nPoints leader Kyle Busch will start from the back of the field after changing an engine.\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP", "description": "Erik Jones held off Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Kyle Busch over the final 50 laps to win the rain-delayed Southern 500 that ended Monday morning.
