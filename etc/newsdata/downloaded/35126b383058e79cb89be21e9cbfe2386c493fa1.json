We've done well to spread out the workload between then (during the pool games),\" Erasmus said, as quoted by Netwerk24.\n\nThe Boks will face either Japan, Ireland or Scotland in the quarter-finals and this could have an impact on which scrumhalves crack the nod in the match-day squad.\n\n\"We'll analyse the game against Canada and look at individual things. We'll also have to look at who we'll be playing. It will have an influence on our choices,\" Erasmus said, noting that Japan, Ireland and Scotland all have different playing styles.\n\nErasmus also heaped praise on Reinach for his efforts against Canada.\n\n\n\n\"Everybody knows he has the X-factor - I knew his dad (the late former Springbok wing Jaco Reinach) well,\" said Erasmus.\n\n\n\n\"He's got exceptional speed, he hasn't had a lot of game time with us since I've been coach, but he's got good speed and anticipation.\"\n\n- Compiled by Herman Mostert", "description": "South Africa's quarter-final opponents at the World Cup will determine what scrumhalves make the match-day squad, coach Rassie Erasmus has hinted.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6151/f5ad242b4f1547179070e208fd8bf207.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
