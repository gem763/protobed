But all that happened was a cease-fire with phase 1 being China buying more farm goods and the US deferring tariffs scheduled for Oct 15. That is why the market reacted negatively near the close on Friday although it was a strong up day. Earnings season starts this week and earnings may be bottoming in Q3 or Q4.\n\nBBBY [fwd P/E 6.8] ran up too much on the news of hiring the new CEO from TGT. Its prices are high except when using 20% discount coupons. It will take a while for turnaround.\n\nGE stock hardly moved on the news of pension freeze, but it will impact its balance sheet positively. It is not an employee/retiree-friendly move. Other companies that have done this include BA, X, AIG, etc. Employees then have to rely on defined-contribution 401k plans. Some companies have transferred pension risks to insurance companies, e.g. BMY, ATH, etc. Companies with largest pension obligations include IBM, GE, GM, F, BA, T, UPS, LMT, XOM, UTX, and some of those are well-funded. Pension accounting is such that companies don\u2019t want to have fully funded pension plans.\n\n[The CME FedWatch tool, based on current fed fund futures quotes, shows the following probabilities for 2019:\n\nFor 3rd hike [cut],\n\n0% for hike [75.4% for cut] at FOMC 10/30/19;\n\n0% for hike [83.4% for cut] at FOMC 12/11/19;\n\nhttp://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html ]\n\nFor the week [index changes only], DJIA +0.91%, SP500 +0.62%, Nasdaq Comp +0.93%, Russell 2000 +0.75%.

Near-term it has been affected negatively by Brexit and rising costs; its newer German business will take time to become profitable. It has divested brewing and coffee businesses. Activist Elliott Advisor has pushed for recent restructuring.\n\nPg M6, Emerging Markets: Mexico may be a winner from the US-China trade war if its President AMLO can stop shooting himself in the foot. Mexican labor is 25% cheaper than that in China. Mexican bonds are attractive at real rates of 4.75%.\n\nPg M9, Commodities: Water stocks have rallied [AWK, XYL, DHR, WAAS; ETF PHO].

The US and global/EM rates look juicy in comparison. There are also bond proxies \u2013 REITs, utilities, telecoms, MLPs, banks. The yield-curve is partially inverted and sort of flat overall. After-tax real-yields are not high for fixed-income. Bond fund inflows are strong, especially for bond ETFs. Risk is if the rates go up.
