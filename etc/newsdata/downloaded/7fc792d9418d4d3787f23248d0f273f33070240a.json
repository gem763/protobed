Photo: Getty Images\n\nYears of being stuck in development hell have finally paid off for the Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes\u2019s new period drama The Gilded Age, because it\u2019s getting one hell of a cast. Per The Hollywood Reporter, the great Cynthia Nixon and the equally great Christine Baranski are starring in the drama as two inevitably fabulous costume-wearing sisters. Baranski is playing Agnes van Rhijn, \u201ca proud and stubborn aristocrat who will never accept the world has changed and old values are being replaced by new ones. She found herself penniless as her parents\u2019 plantation was foundering even before the Civil War but managed to catch a husband just in time. She worships her son Oscar, but the ardor isn\u2019t mutual.\u201d Nixon, meanwhile, is Ada Brook, \u201canother victim of the old South, but unlike sister Agnes, she didn\u2019t find a way out until it was too late and was forced back on her sister\u2019s charity. Not naturally confrontational, she\u2019s nonetheless capable of standing up for what she believes.\u201d The series centers on a character named Marian Brook, their niece, \u201cthe orphaned daughter of a Southern general, who moves into the home of her rigidly conventional aunts,\u201d and Peggy Scott, an African-American woman \u201cmasquerading as her maid.\u201d Both of those roles are yet to be cast, but yes, you can rest easy knowing you will get to watch Baranski and Nixon bicker with each other across large, expensive dinner tables, which is pretty much what people want from a Julian Fellowes show (and yes, the politics seem potentially iffy, which is also what you get from a Julian Fellowes show).\n\nNixon and Baranski both appeared in Addams Family Values, though this would be their first time working together on TV, and also marks a surprise reunion of the 1983 Broadway production of The Real Thing, where Baranski played Nixon\u2019s mother, and during which Nixon famously would also race down the street to appear in another play, Hurlyburly. We just wanted to get you started on one inevitable Gilded Age press-campaign talking point.\n\nFilling out the show\u2019s cast is Amanda Peet, who will play a character named Bertha Russell, a woman from a middle-class background who\u2019s married to George Russell, a \u201cclassic robber baron of his time,\u201d played by Morgan Spector. The Gilded Age came to HBO thanks to the new WarnerMedia chief Bob Greenblatt, who also brought Smash from Showtime to NBC. Let\u2019s hope this show is less of a hot mess than that one, but we wouldn\u2019t mind it if Baranski got to sing.", "description": "Cynthia Nixon and Christine Baranski are playing sisters in HBO\u2019s Julian Fellowes (Downton Abbey) drama The Gilded Age.", "authors": ["Jackson Mchenry"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/26/26-christine-baranski-cynthia-nixon.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
