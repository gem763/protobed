Either they\u2019re impeaching President Trump or they\u2019re not \u2014 and it looks like they\u2019re not.\n\nWhy Congress is not fulfilling what would seem to be its constitutional duty has nothing to do with the merits of the case against Trump, who adds to the list of his impeachable offenses almost daily. It has everything to do with a political calculation that I hope Democrats do not come to regret.\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said this week his panel is \u201cexamining the various malfeasances of the president with the view toward possibly . . . recommending articles of impeachment to the House.\u201d But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said this is just a \u201cpath of investigation\u201d that might lead to a formal impeachment inquiry or, presumably, might not. Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) said Wednesday the House has not launched an impeachment inquiry, but later clarified that he fully supports the \u201cinvestigation\u201d whose subject, according to Nadler, is impeachment.\n\nOn Thursday, Nadler\u2019s committee approved procedural guidelines for its investigation or inquiry or whatever anyone wants to call it. \u201cI salute them for that work,\u201d Pelosi said later. But she added that \u201cpeople are saying it\u2019s good to be careful about how we proceed.\u201d\n\nEnough with the oh-so-subtle semantic distinctions. Do something or don\u2019t \u2014 and be prepared to explain why.\n\nWith respect, how much more investigation do we need? Former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III spent two years compiling what amounts to an impeachment road map. Part Two of his voluminous report clearly establishes, to the satisfaction of more than 1,000 former prosecutors, that Trump\u2019s actions would have justified multiple charges of obstruction of justice. If you take the view that impeachment requires the president to have committed a statutory crime, Mueller handed it to Congress on a platter.\n\nBut impeachment doesn\u2019t even necessitate a finding that the president, beyond a reasonable doubt, violated the law. The framers left it vague, declining to define what the phrase \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d means. But from their writings we know they deeply feared that a president might use his expansive powers to act as a tyrant rather than as a servant of the people.\n\n\u201cAbuse of power\u201d is not a federal crime, but it was one of the impeachment articles being prepared against President Richard M. Nixon before he resigned. Trump abuses his power in ways that must have the framers whirring like turbines in their graves.\n\nTo cite just a few examples, look at his border policy. He ignored a court ruling and continued to separate migrant families and jail children in cages and deny them soap or toothbrushes. When Congress, which has the power of the purse, declined to fund his ridiculous border wall, he snatched billions of dollars that had been duly appropriated for other programs. According to credible reports, he told underlings to break the law to keep migrants out of the country, if necessary, and promised to pardon them if they got in trouble.\n\nBeyond abuse of power, there is the principle that no president should use the office to corruptly enrich himself. In some cases, there appear to be clear violations of the emoluments clause. In others, there\u2019s just plain old-fashioned graft. Of all the hotels in Scotland, U.S. military crews can find nowhere to stay except at Trump\u2019s overpriced golf resort? Seriously? And Congress thinks this is acceptable?\n\nI believe the framers would also consider impeachable the way Trump lies constantly to the American people. I don\u2019t need to give examples; just look at his Twitter feed or listen to the comments he makes on the White House lawn. I know Trump may believe concepts such as trust and honor are for suckers, but his incessant lying defiles the presidency \u2014 and members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, know it does. But they do nothing about it.\n\nThe damage Trump is doing is limited only by his lack of focus. We can only hope that after he is gone things return to normal, though that is not guaranteed. And heaven help us if there is a genuine crisis while he\u2019s still in office.\n\nThe political calculation that Democrats are making is that impeachment, especially if followed by acquittal in the GOP-controlled Senate, might make Trump\u2019s reelection more likely. There\u2019s no way of knowing, but I doubt it would make much of a difference one way or the other. Trump\u2019s going to inflame his base anyway. Democrats had better motivate theirs.\n\nBut everyone should realize that history\u2019s calculation must be considered as well. Future generations will judge all who decided, for whatever reason, to put politics above duty.\n\nRead more from Eugene Robinson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.
