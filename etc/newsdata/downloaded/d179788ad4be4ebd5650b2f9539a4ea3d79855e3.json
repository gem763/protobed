REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\n\nResidents of the former British colony awoke to roads, shop fronts and buildings across the financial center daubed in graffiti, windows in government buildings smashed and parts of pavements uprooted by protesters.\n\nMost shops, restaurants and cafes stretching from the main Central business district to the bustling tourist area of Causeway Bay closed early on Sunday as police and demonstrators faced off in sometimes violent clashes into the night.\n\nThe Chinese territory remains on edge ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic on Oct. 1, with authorities eager to avoid scenes that could embarrass the central government in Beijing as activists plan mass protests.\n\nIn some of the worst and most widespread violence in more than three months of anti-government unrest, the Asian financial hub marked the fifth anniversary over the weekend of the start of the \u201cUmbrella\u201d protests, a series of pro-democracy demonstrations in 2014 that failed to wrestle concessions from Beijing.\n\nThe city\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, the focus of the unrest, is set to leave for Beijing on Monday to celebrate the anniversary.\n\nLam had sent out invitations \u201crequesting the pleasure of your company\u201d at a flag-raising ceremony and National Day reception at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai on Tuesday.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why she had the change of heart but the government said Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung Kin-chung would stand in for her.\n\nA series of strikes is planned on Monday as well as multiple demonstrations across the city on Tuesday.\n\nProtesters are angry about what they see as creeping interference by Beijing in their city\u2019s affairs despite a promise of autonomy when British rule ended in 1997.\n\nThe trigger for the protests was planned legislation, now withdrawn, that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial, despite Hong Kong having its own much-respected independent judiciary.\n\nThe protests have since broadened into calls for universal suffrage.\n\nPolice said in a statement on Monday that an officer had to fire a warning shot to protect their own safety after they were \u201csurrounded and attacked by a large group of violent protesters\u201d on Sunday.\n\nBy early morning on Monday all MTR metro stations on the city\u2019s main island were open as normal and stores had re-opened.\n\nMany restaurants and stores have had to repeatedly shut with the protests taking a growing toll on the city\u2019s economy as it faces its first recession in a decade.", "description": "Hong Kong's metro stations and roads re-opened on Monday, after a chaotic weekend that saw police fire water cannon, tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters who set fires and threw petrol bombs outside government offices and across central districts.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435347116&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T013", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
