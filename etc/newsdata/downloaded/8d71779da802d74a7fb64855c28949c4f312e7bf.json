(AP) - Between Thomas Morstead placing punts just short of opponents\u2019 goal lines and diminutive returner Deonte Harris deftly darting away from tacklers, the New Orleans Saints like the way their special teams have influenced the outcomes of games.\n\n\u201cWe know that yards can equate to points; that\u2019s a fact,\u201d Saints coach Sean Payton asserted this week while discussing how special teams affect field position. \u201cIf you believe 100 yards equals seven points - in and around that number - then that can directly impact winning and losing.\u201d\n\nThe first full game New Orleans had to play this season without star quarterback Drew Brees - a 33-27 triumph in Seattle last Sunday - served as a reminder of how much can depend on the unit that plays by far the fewest snaps.\n\nMorstead was named NFC special teams player of the week after a game in which he averaged a 52-yard net on six punts and had two punts downed inside the 5-yard line. If Morstead hadn\u2019t won that honor, it might well have gone to Harris for his 53-yard punt return touchdown.\n\n\u201cYou just kind of go into every game feeling like you are going to be the difference in a positive way, but you just don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to play out,\u201d Morstead said. \u201cIt does feel nice at the end of a game, like that to feel like special teams as a whole made a difference in the game.\u201d\n\nWhether those phases of the game could again be a significant factor on Sunday night against Dallas remains to be seen, but Cowboys coach Jason Garrett has taken notice of the Saints\u2018 special teams\u2019 success.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re trying to do on special teams is do something that can change the game,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cHopefully, you can tip the field, tip the balance of the game and they\u2019ve been able to do that up to this point and those are the kind of plays that make a huge difference.\u201d\n\nWhen the Saints\u2018 offense has been at its most prolific, it might have been easy to overlook the kicking game\u2019s role, particularly in numerous lopsided victories in which New Orleans punted few times.\n\nBut if a game is close, or if the offense is sputtering, then good punting - and good punt returns - are at a premium. And it\u2019s not clear if the Saints can replicate the offensive production they\u2019ve historically enjoyed with Brees while another quarterback is under center.\n\nThe Saints used two quarterbacks last week in Seattle. Teddy Bridgewater was the starter and played the vast majority of the offensive snaps. Taysom Hill subbed in as a read-option run threat; he either handed off or ran himself. The Saints gained 265 yards on offense, barely more than half of the Seahawks\u2019 514 yards. New Orleans still won in large part because of special teams play, along with a defensive touchdown on a fumble return.\n\nHill, who also serves as an up-back on punts, said being able to play on special teams with the Saints has helped him appreciate how much that unit can influence games, be it with blocked punts, fake punts, returns or simply good punts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about, in the NFL, winning the field position battle. We talk about it week in and week out,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThe punt is the biggest contributor to that, and the punt return. And we saw how that affected the game last week.\u201d\n\nNow in his 11th season out of SMU, Morstead has established himself as one of the elite punters in the NFL. He can send booming spirals far down field with accuracy toward one sideline or the other. He can also chip end-over-end, Australian Rules Football-style punts that seem to stick inside the 10-yard line without going into the end zone for a touchback.\n\n\u201cThomas makes our job really easy,\u201d Hill said. \u201cWhen you pin a team or returner, right or left, outside the numbers, it\u2019s really difficult for those guys to get a return.\u201d\n\nMorstead, meanwhile, has enjoyed seeing how Harris, a rookie out of Division II Assumption College, has burst onto the scene as a potent return man.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s obviously very talented. Everybody can see that,\u201d Morstead said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t lack any confidence.\u201d\n\nHarris did, however, commit his first major mistake in Seattle when he muffed a punt. The Seahawks recovered, but failed to capitalize when Saints made a fourth-down stop.\n\nMorstead said he told Harris: \u201cDon\u2019t lose your stinger. Keep being aggressive how you\u2019ve been. You just can\u2019t get ahead of yourself.\u201d\n\nAfter all, the Saints might need a few more good returns while their offense adjusts to life without Brees.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Between Thomas Morstead placing punts just short of opponents' goal lines and diminutive returner Deonte Harris deftly darting away from tacklers, the New Orleans Saints like the way their special teams have influenced the outcomes of games.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brett Martel"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/saints_seahawks_football_13706_c0-109-2598-1623_s1770x1032.jpg?4edd468731fb8351626bdd1ea17445d0afdcd2c3", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
