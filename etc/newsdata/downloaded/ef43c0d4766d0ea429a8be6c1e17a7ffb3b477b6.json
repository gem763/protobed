The interceptor sends a text message to local operators that can come and empty it when it's full.\n\nSlat showed off how it worked by dumping hundreds of yellow rubber ducks into the water at the launch event in Rotterdam's port. The interceptor caught nearly all of them.\n\nThe machines currently cost about 700,000 euros ($775,600), but Slat said the cost will likely drop as production increases.\n\nJan van Franeker of the Wageningen Marine Research institute has been critical of The Ocean Cleanup in the past, but said the new device looks promising.\n\n\"I am really happy they finally moved toward the source of the litter,\" he said in a telephone interview. \"The design, from what I can see, looks pretty good.\"\n\nSlat argued that the economic impact of not picking plastic out of rivers is higher than the cost of buying and using the machines.\n\n\"Deploying interceptors is even cheaper than deploying nothing at all,\" he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow AP's full coverage of climate issues at https://www.apnews.com/Climate", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
