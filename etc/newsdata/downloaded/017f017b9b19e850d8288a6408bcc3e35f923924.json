By age 15, O\u2019Neill was on the cover of Vogue and earning $80,000 a year, the outlet shared. At 15, her beloved horse threw the star, causing her to break her neck and back. At age 18, she married the first of eight husbands, and by 22 had her first movie role opposite John Wayne.\n\n\u2018MARY TYLER MOORE\u2019 STAR ED ASNER SAYS CAST WAS LIKE A FAMILY: \u2018WE FORGAVE EACH OTHER\u2019S FAULTS\u2019\n\nBut as O\u2019Neill\u2019s fame skyrocketed, her personal life came crashing down. People magazine shared that her daughter Aimee was reportedly sexually abused by her fifth husband. O\u2019Neill also later shot herself.\n\nSUSAN OLSEN TALKS 'A VERY BRADY BUNCH RENOVATION,' SAYS VOTING FOR TRUMP GOT HER IN TROUBLE ON RADIO SHOW\n\nBut after all the private trauma O\u2019Neill endured, she said finding God has given her a new sense of purpose to help others in need. She currently leads the Hope and Healing at Hillenglade (HHH) program in Nashville, Tenn., which offers veterans and their families time with horses to help them cope with PTSD and rebuild relationships with loved ones.\n\nO\u2019Neill spoke to Fox News about working alongside Wayne, her relationship with Aimee today and how faith saved her.\n\nFox News: I understand your first big break was in 1970\u2019s \u201cRio Lobo\u201d with John Wayne. What was that like?\n\nJennifer O\u2019Neill: I have to admit, I was a total snob. I was 21 and by then he was an icon. But I really wanted to work with Al Pacino. I wanted to work with the New York actors. I laugh now, after all these years, at that moment of youth and stupidity. I was lucky enough to have that opportunity to work with John Wayne and he was everything and a bag of chips. He always on set, professional. He was just an amazing man. You did not want to speak politics with him and you did not want to play cards with him. But [he] was the most helpful, delightful.\n\nJOHN WAYNE'S SON RECALLS GROWING UP WITH 'THE DUKE': 'HE KNEW HE WASN\u2019T GOING TO BE AROUND WHEN I WAS OLDER'\n\nWe were all a bunch of young actors and yet he would always help us whenever we needed it. It was fantastic. There was no ego. He simply just wanted to share his knowledge of the industry. I remember the one thing that he told me that really resonated with me years later when I went to Europe to work\u2026 John Wayne told me: 'The key to being a good actor is hearing it for the first time. If you ever notice that you\u2019re responding the same way over and over, you\u2019re not present in the moment.'\n\nFox News: How was it filming 1971\u2019s \u201cSummer of \u201942\u201d?\n\nO\u2019Neill: It was kind of a tough shoot because [Robert] Mulligan, who is a great director, wanted me to be separated from three young men in the movie because they weren\u2019t professional actors. Therefore, he didn\u2019t want us to be hanging out like friends after filming. He wanted that magic of when I walked into the room. So I was isolated, put away from everyone, which was a little hard. But other than that\u2026 it was awesome. It was called a little film in those days\u2026 But it really was just a magical time. I didn\u2019t know it then, but I know it now. You know when you got something special when everyone shows up and everyone is crying.\n\nVERONICA LAKE APPEARED 'VERY DAMAGED' IN HER LATER YEARS\n\nFox News: Are you surprised this film has become a cult classic?\n\nO\u2019Neill: Not really -- it\u2019s a Mulligan film. It resonates with people. It was beautifully done and it\u2019s just timeless. When it came up, gals would always come up to me and say, \"My husband is in love with you.: And because the film plays in a pretty regular basis for the last 20 years, I now hear, \"My husband\u2019s in love with you and so is my son.: And to think, I was only in the film for 15 minutes.\n\nJOHN WAYNE'S SON RECALLS GROWING UP WITH 'THE DUKE'\n\nFox News: You attempted to take your life as a teen. What were you trying to escape from?\n\nO\u2019Neill: I wasn\u2019t trying to escape anything, I was trying to be heard\u2026 My parents decided to move and I couldn\u2019t take my dog. I know that sounds ridiculous, but my dog was my world because I felt invisible growing up... I just wanted to be heard.\n\nJUDY GARLAND AND SID LUFT\u2019S DAUGHTER LORNA REFLECTS ON COUPLE\u2019S TUMULTUOUS MARRIAGE\n\nFor that reason, and I\u2019m thrilled that God was there when I didn\u2019t even know him and saved me. God really did save my life. I didn\u2019t have any permanent damage from that attempt because I was in the hospital for two weeks in a coma. I could have had a lot of damage, but I was spared. When we moved and the dog was taken to the pound, I became determined that no one was ever going to be able to take anything away from me\u2026 I wanted to earn love. I thought, if I could get straight-As, then I could earn my parents\u2019 love.\n\nFox News: How old were you when this occurred?\n\nO\u2019Neill: I was 14 when I stupidly attempted suicide just to be heard. It fell on deaf ears. My parents basically said this stunt isn\u2019t going to work, the dog is going away\u2026 It was never spoken about. As I write in my books, nothing was ever understood, recognized, dealt with or healed. What happens to people like me is that radical events get stuffed down and they are never healed. And then it becomes fodder for future difficulties. But all of that started to change when I came into my faith.\n\nKATHIE LEE GIFFORD ON FAITH BEING 'CENTRAL' TO WHO SHE IS: 'IT'S NOT A RELIGION TO ME, IT'S A RELATIONSHIP\u2019\n\nFox News: What\u2019s your relationship like with your daughter Aimee today?\n\nO\u2019Neill: I\u2019m so proud of her. We have totally healed. At the time, way back then\u2026you have to realize that 30-something years ago, sexual abuse was not dinner conversation. It wasn\u2019t on the news. I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing. Never thought of it. So I did not know at the time whether my husband was lying to me or my daughter was lying to me. It was a horrible time because he passed lie detector tests\u2026 We divorced and he did it again to his next family, the next teenager. But Aimee has been amazing. She\u2019s always been so forthright\u2026 I think there were 7 people living in the house at the time. No one ever saw or heard anything.\n\n'LAND OF THE LOST' STAR KATHY COLEMAN RECALLS GETTING INTO TROUBLE ON SET, REVEALS WHY HIT SHOW CAME TO AN END\n\n[My husband and] Aimee were best friends. I was the happiest woman in the world to see my daughter have so much fun with her stepfather\u2026 But he manipulated her. She was a child. Whether she looked like a big girl at 14 or not, she was still a child. It just didn\u2019t occur to me that something like that could possibly be happening. But with time, I felt like something was wrong\u2026 He was just a manipulator.\n\n\u2018THE LOVE BOAT\u2019 CAPTAIN GAVIN MACLEOD SAYS HE DOESN\u2019T GET RESIDUALS\n\nBut Aimee is 52 years old right now with three amazing sons. She\u2019s an animal behaviorist and is one of the most compassionate human beings\u2026 I still sit there with my jaw on the ground, amazed at her abilities. We\u2019re very close. It\u2019s amazing because the enemy wants to destroy and deceive families. But we survived.\n\n[Looking back,] I didn\u2019t know who was telling the truth because no one saw anything and the lie detector said otherwise. So I just didn\u2019t know what to believe. And this is something I\u2019ve never heard about. I know that\u2019s not an excuse, but it\u2019s the truth\u2026 But now I believe her and she believes me. I just didn\u2019t know what was going on.\n\nPAT BOONE'S DAUGHTER DEBBY SAYS SHE'S NOT 'SQUEAKY-CLEAN' LIKE DAD, DETAILS CONNECTION WITH GEORGE CLOONEY\n\nFox News: You accidentally shot yourself in 1982. What exactly happened?\n\nO\u2019Neill: It was an accident\u2026 I hate guns. I believe we all have the right to bear them, but they scare me. I went up to our bedroom and my son was having dinner with the nanny. I noticed that the safe kept in the closet was wide open. When I looked closer, there was [my husband\u2019s] gun lying in a bowl of bullets. I was so furious because my son could have easily reached it.\n\nI picked up what turned out to be a 38-caliber and it went off. It shot through my hip and stomach\u2026 But again, God saved my life. I could have been completely paralyzed. God has been protecting me all these years\u2026 We all have a purpose in our lives and we\u2019re not going to leave until we turn it down or move forward and do it\u2026 And I think I\u2019m still here to show people about the power of God\u2019s love and that there is hope.\n\nBRITTNI DE LA MORA LEFT THE PORN INDUSTRY FOR RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD: 'I DIDN'T WANT TO ADMIT I MADE A MISTAKE'\n\nELVIS PRESLEY\u2019S PAL WINK MARTINDALE REVEALS WHY HE \u2018BROKE DOWN\u2019 AFTER SEEING THE KING FOR THE LAST TIME\n\nFox News: How has faith played a role in your life?\n\nO\u2019Neill: Faith saved my life. I was looking for love in all the wrong places. Moving through life very wounded. Many marriages, nine miscarriages \u2013 it\u2019s all operatic. I came into my faith at 38 years old. I\u2019ve now been married for 24 years to my husband. I teach, I write books and I have the honor to turn hard times\u2026 into good. I had an abortion when I was 22. Didn\u2019t want it.\n\nNow God is giving me the platform to address that and show there is hope and you can heal\u2026 I\u2019ve come into my faith and it\u2019s given me a renewed strength in focus and purpose. And I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m really here at the end of the day\u2026 Now I\u2019m 71. I\u2019m still here. And I\u2019m not done. God is always there for us to have a fresh start.\n\nIf you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).", "description": "Jennifer O\u2019Neill\u2019s life is one that not even Hollywood could have created for the big screen.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-180348942.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-27"}
