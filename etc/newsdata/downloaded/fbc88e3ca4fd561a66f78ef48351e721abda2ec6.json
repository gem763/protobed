It also claims that Trump\u2019s due process rights are being violated and is attacking the conduct of House intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi has insisted the House is well within its rules to conduct oversight of the executive branch under the Constitution regardless of a formal impeachment inquiry vote.\n\nSchiff, commenting before the White House letter was released, said, \u201cFor this impeachment inquiry we are determined to find answers.\u201d\n\nThe Constitution states the House has the sole power of impeachment, and that the Senate has the sole power to conduct impeachment trials. It specifies that a president can be removed from office for \u201ctreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d if supported by a two-thirds Senate vote. But it offers little guidance beyond that on proceedings.\n\nThe White House letter marks the beginning of a new strategy to counter the impeachment threat to Trump: Stall. Obfuscate. Attack. Repeat. Trump aides have been honing their approach after two weeks of what allies have described as a listless and unfocused response to the impeachment probe.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Trump intensified his fight with Congress by blocking Gordon Sondland, the U.S. European Union ambassador, from testifying behind closed doors about the president\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.\n\nSondland\u2019s attorney, Robert Luskin, said his client was \u201cprofoundly disappointed\u201d that he wouldn\u2019t be able to testify. And Schiff said Sondland\u2019s no-show was \u201cyet additional strong evidence\u201d of obstruction of Congress by Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that will only strengthen a possible impeachment case.\n\nThe House followed up Tuesday afternoon with subpoenas for Sondland\u2019s testimony and records.\n\nAs lawmakers seek to amass ammunition to be used in an impeachment trial, the White House increasingly believes all-out warfare is its best course of action.\n\n\u201cWhat they did to this country is unthinkable. It\u2019s lucky that I\u2019m the president. A lot of people said very few people could handle it. I sort of thrive on it,\u201d Trump said Monday at the White House. \u201cYou can\u2019t impeach a president for doing a great job. This is a scam.\u201d\n\nA whistleblower\u2019s complaint and text messages released by another envoy portray Sondland as a potentially important witness in allegations that the Republican president sought to dig up dirt on a Democratic rival in Ukraine and other countries in the name of foreign policy.\n\nPelosi said thwarting the witness testimony on Tuesday was an \u201cabuse of power\u201d in itself by the president.\n\nA senior administration official told reporters that no additional witnesses under its purview will be permitted to appear in front of Congress or comply with document requests, saying the policy under the current circumstances is that the administration will have \u201ca full halt\u201d because \u201cthis is not a valid procedure\u201d for an impeachment inquiry. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the administration\u2019s position.\n\nThe letter mounts a sweeping and aggressive attack on the House proceedings and signals a battle ahead over whether the president is receiving the legal protections he and his lawyers believe he deserves.\n\nThe White House is claiming that Trump\u2019s constitutional rights to cross-examine witnesses and review all evidence in impeachment proceedings extend even to House investigations, not just a potential Senate trial. It also is calling on Democrats to grant Republicans in the House subpoena power to seek evidence in the president\u2019s defense.\n\nThe White House letter came as a federal judge heard arguments Tuesday in a separate case on whether the House had undertaken a formal impeachment inquiry despite not having taken an official vote and whether the inquiry can be characterized, under the law, as a \u201cjudicial proceeding.\u201d\n\nThat distinction matters because while grand jury testimony is ordinarily secret, one exception authorizes a judge to disclose it in connection with a judicial proceeding. House Democrats are seeking grand jury testimony from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation as they conduct their impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThe House under the Constitution sets its own rules, and the House has sole power over impeachment,\u201d Douglas Letter, a lawyer for the House Judiciary Committee, told the court.\n\n\u2014\n\nEric Tucker contributed.\n\n___\n\nFollow Miller on Twitter at https://twitter.com/zekejmiller and Colvin at https://twitter.com/colvinj", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The White House declared Tuesday it will not cooperate with what it termed the \"illegitimate\" impeachment probe by House Democrats,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/08/4429fd_trump-84556-donald-trump-president-donald-trump-pauses-speaking-ceremony-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
