The document is put out by the IC IG for intelligence workers who need to file urgent complaints that trigger special treatment under the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act.\n\nAccording to the GOP and an army of conservative commentators, the old version of the form prohibited workers from submitting urgent complaints based on secondhand information; only misconduct witnessed personally could be reported. That changed in early August, the false claim goes, when ICIG Michael Atkinson snuck through a hasty revision to the complaint form that reversed long-standing policy.\n\n\u201cWhistleblowers were required to provide direct, first-hand knowledge of allegations,\u201d reads a Saturday tweet by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. \u201cBut just days before the Ukraine whistleblower came forward, the IC secretly removed that requirement from the complaint form.\u201d\n\n\u201cRecords show that the intelligence community quietly revised the formal whistleblower complaint form in August 2019,\u201d Rudy Giuliani tweeted on Sunday. \u201cEliminating the requirement to have direct, first-hand knowledge of perceived wrongdoing. Coincidence?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was on the form literally until apparently very recently,\u201d said Trump\u2019s other lawyer, Jay Sukulow, in an appearance on Hannity. \u201cMonths ago: no first hand information, no report.\u201d\n\n\u201cWOW, they got caught,\u201d tweeted Trump. \u201cEnd the Witch Hunt now!\u201d\n\nThe Atkinson smear comes amid a broad GOP campaign seemingly calculated to discredit the whistleblower report as unreliable, partisan hearsay, despite it having already been corroborated by an IC IG review and confirmed by the White House\u2019s own transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. It began late Friday with a story from the conservative website The Federalist headlined \u201cIntel Community Secretly Gutted Requirement Of First-Hand Whistleblower Knowledge.\u201d The article claimed \u201cthe intelligence community secretly revised the formal whistleblower complaint form in August 2019 to eliminate the requirement of direct, first-hand knowledge of wrongdoing.\u201d\n\nBombshell Whistleblower Complaint Released: White House Covered Up Trump\u2019s Ukraine Call\n\n\u201cIt seems like they are jumping to a lot of conclusions based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the law, the regulatory framework, and the language on one form,\u201d said Julian Sanchez, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute.\n\nThe kernel of fact near the center of the conspiracy theory is that there is, indeed, a new version of Form 401 dated August 2019.\n\nA question on the form explicitly anticipates tips based on secondhand information, and asks the whistleblower to check a box: \u201cI have direct and personal knowledge,\u201d or, \u201cI heard about it from others.\u201d The Federalist used a screenshot of that field to illustrate its story.\n\nWhat the article didn\u2019t mention or screenshot is a nearly identical field gracing Form 401 since at least May 2018, making it impossible that it was added as an easement for Trump\u2019s whistleblower. The major difference in the fields is that the old form includes three options instead of two, subdividing secondhand sources into outside source and \u201cother employees.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a reason the form has allowed secondhand reports all along. The requirement for firsthand whistleblowing only is completely made up.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been a requirement that a whistleblower have firsthand knowledge of what they\u2019re reporting,\u201d said Irvin McCullough, an investigator at the nonprofit Government Accountability Project (and the son of a former IC IG). \u201cThey need to have a reasonable belief. The firsthand information is usually gathered by the inspector general, as I believe did occur here.\u201d\n\nWhen the IC IG receives an urgent report, it has 14 days to conduct a preliminary review under the law. If that investigation produces enough direct evidence, the IC IG can rule it \u201ccredible,\u201d which triggers the legal requirement to forward the report to the director of central intelligence (DCI), and from there to Congress.", "description": "Photo Illustration by Lyne Lucien/The Daily BeastFrom Donald Trump on down, prominent Republicans used part of their weekend to falsely accuse Trump\u2019s hand-picked intelligence community inspector general (IC IG) of secretly changing the requirements for intelligence workers to submit whistleblower tips", "authors": ["Kevin Poulsen"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yJWdTVwwF78Y3_LivQe62A--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/3437556b14ed8126ac6591e46cf66b83", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
