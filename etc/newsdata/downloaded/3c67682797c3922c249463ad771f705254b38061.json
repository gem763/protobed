Tonight, I\u2019m looking to see how Bernie Sanders bounces back after suffering a heart attack two weeks ago. He\u2019s been off the campaign trail since then, but Sanders and his aides say he\u2019s feeling great \u2014 and that his performance on the stage will show his vitality.\n\nA HuffPost/YouGov poll found that 59 percent of registered voters said Sanders\u2019 physical condition is not good enough. That means a lot is riding on this debate. But what\u2019s good for Sanders is that he has relatively low expectations \u2014 12 percent of Democratic primary voters said they expected him to perform the best of any candidate, according to a poll by POLITICO/Morning Consult \u2014 making it theoretically easier for him to surpass expectations.", "description": "Get real-time analysis from our 2020 team as you watch the fourth Democratic Debate in Ohio.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/6d/12/561eb95d41fb961439f122988f5f/d4-share.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
