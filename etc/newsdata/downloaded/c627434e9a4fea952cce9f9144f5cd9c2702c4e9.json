Jackson, who finished third in Heisman voting two years ago while with the Louisville Cardinals, slid to the Baltimore Ravens as the final pick of Round 1 in 2018.\n\nBrown was released by the New England Patriots last week after just 11 days with the organization amid allegations of sexual assault and misconduct by two women.\n\nAlthough the 31-year-old Miami native posted on Twitter last Sunday he \"will not be playing in the NFL anymore,\" his agent, Drew Rosenhaus, downplayed that stance on the 99 Problems podcast (via ESPN) with former standout defensive tackle Warren Sapp on Wednesday.\n\n\"I believe that Antonio wants to continue his career in the NFL,\" Rosenhaus said. \"I have had discussions with a few teams that are very interested in him and want to know about his future and what's going on with the NFL. Hopefully, when that is all resolved, Antonio will be able to continue his Hall of Fame career.\"\n\nThe league issued a statement after Brown was released, stating it would investigate the allegations \"vigorously and expeditiously,\" but it provided no timetable for a decision on potential discipline.\n\nIn the meantime, Brown has taken to Twitter for feuds with NFL owners, Los Angeles Rams safety Eric Weddle and Sports Illustrated writer Robert Klemko.", "description": "Cleveland Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield became the latest Twitter target of free-agent wide receiver  Antonio Brown  on Saturday morning...", "authors": ["Tim Daniels"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/830/435/hi-res-35d174ef78850e0505ce2cb29bffe3dd_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
