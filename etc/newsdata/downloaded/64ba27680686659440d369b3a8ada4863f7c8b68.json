In the group stages of a tournament, if a Super Over is tied then the match result will be logged as a tie.\n\n___\n\nMore AP cricket: www.apnews.com/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - Three months after New Zealand lost the Cricket World Cup to England on a boundary countback, the sport's governing body...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
