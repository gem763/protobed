The fires have consumed the most land since 2015, when government data showed 2.6 million hectares burned.\n\nThe area burned surged from 328,724 hectares that was consumed between January and August, Panjaitan said, and added that the size of the burned area is expected to continue expanding this month, although not \"as drastic\" as last month's.\n\n\"Fire fighting is continued to be carried out, even today the teams are on the ground working to prevent escalation,\" Panjaitan said.\n\nThe country has spent months to battle forest fires in Sumatra and Borneo that have caused thick haze which drifted over neighbouring Malaysia and Singapore.\n\nRain has started falling in some areas on Sumatra which offered some respite, but Panjaitan does not expect the rainy season to fully arrive until around mid-November.\n\nForest and peat fires typically take place in Sumatra and Borneo, often linked to slash-and-burn practices to clear areas for palm cultivation.\n\nHowever, Panjaitan warned that there are rising cases of fire in Java island, including in conservation areas.\n\nOn Sunday, the country's disaster mitigation agency said four hikers were evacuated from Mount Ranti in East Java due to forest fire.\n\n\"In Java, the fires are usually unintentional because people who went to hike throw away cigarette butts carelessly,\" Panjaitan said.
