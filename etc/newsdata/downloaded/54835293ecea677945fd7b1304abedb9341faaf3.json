Add Interest\n\nNow, in their new book, New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, are sparking fresh controversy, alleging that investigators failed to interview over two dozen people \"who may have had corroborating evidence\" regarding Kavanaugh\u2019s second accuser\u2019s account and, potentially, overlooked another alleged victim entirely.\n\nIn a report, adapted from the soon-to-be-released book titled \"The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation,\" The New York Times focuses on Deborah Ramirez, a classmate of Kavanaugh\u2019s at Yale University. Her allegations against him were first detailed in The New Yorker, less than a week after Blasey Ford\u2019s account was made public. Ramirez told the New Yorker that during a dorm party sometime in the 1983-1984 academic year, Kavanaugh \"thrust his penis in her face\" causing her \"to touch it without her consent.\"\n\nKavanaugh flatly denied Ramirez\u2019s accusations.\n\n\"This alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen,\" he said in statement soon after the report was published. \"The people who knew me then know that this did not happen, and have said so. This is a smear, plain and simple.\"\n\nKavanaugh again denied the allegations, along with Blasey Ford\u2019s and those of another accuser, Julie Swetnick, during his public testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nThrough a court spokeswoman, Kavanaugh declined comment to ABC News on the allegations made in the Times story published Sunday and the new book out this week.\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nAt the request of members of the committee, President Donald Trump eased limitation on an FBI background check into Kavanaugh, sources close to the process told ABC News last October. Trump had previously called for it to be \"limited in scope,\" but sources told ABC News he later authorized the FBI to interview anyone it wanted, with a focus on accusations raised separately by Ford and Ramirez.\n\nIn early October, the FBI delivered its report to the Senate Judiciary Committee. After reviewing the report, the committee\u2019s chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley called the women\u2019s accusations \"uncorroborated\" and said \"neither the Judiciary Committee nor the FBI could locate any third parties who can attest to any of the allegations.\"\n\nKavanaugh was ultimately confirmed to the Supreme Court by a vote of 50-48.\n\nThe book authors now claim that FBI investigation wasn\u2019t sufficiently thorough, saying that Ramirez\u2019s legal team gave the FBI a list of at least 25 individuals who they said might have been able to confirm her allegations, but that none of them were interviewed as part of the bureau\u2019s supplemental investigation, even after some of them tried to contract the FBI on their own accord. The Times also reports that two FBI agents interviewed Ramirez and said that they found her \"credible,\" but that the Senate \"had imposed strict limits on the investigation.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Ramirez declined to provide a comment to ABC News.\n\nThe book also includes another Yale student\u2019s account of a separate incident from Kavanaugh\u2019s freshman year, where he said he saw Kavanagh \"with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.\" However, authors allege that even though that classmate notified senators and the FBI, the FBI did not investigate his claim. The book says that the alleged victim has refused to discuss the incident and several friends said she does not recall it, although the Times report does not include this detail.\n\nThese newly revealed allegations against Kavanaugh are prompting both calls for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment and renewed support from his allies. Trump, championed his nominee on Twitter, writing, \"He is an innocent man who has been treated HORRIBLY. Such lies about him. They want to scare him into turning Liberal!\"\n\nBrett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue. The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can\u2019t let that happen! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019\n\nCan\u2019t let Brett Kavanaugh give Radical Left Democrat (Liberal Plus) Opinions based on threats of Impeaching him over made up stories (sound familiar?), false allegations, and lies. This is the game they play. Fake and Corrupt News is working overtime! #ProtectKavanaugh \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019\n\nMany of the Democratic candidates for president were quick to call for Kavanaugh\u2019s removal. Sens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro both called for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment through tweets. Both former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders were critical of the new reports, but did not specifically call for impeachment.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., weighed in on last year\u2019s investigations into Kavanaugh on \"This Week\" telling ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos, \"My concern is that the process was a sham.\"\n\nABC News has reached out to the Senate Judiciary Committee for comment, but did not receive any response.\n\nABC News\u2019 Kaitlyn Folmer, Martha Raddatz, Trish Turner and Devin Dwyer contributed to this report.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
