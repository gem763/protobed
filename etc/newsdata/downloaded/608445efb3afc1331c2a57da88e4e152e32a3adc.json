He showed no signs of letting up this time.\n\n\u201cWhat a great team over there,\u201d Keuchel said. \u201cThat\u2019s really, really quality lineup. It\u2019s probably my favorite to face, just because of how good they are. Some of their role players are just pros.\u201d\n\nKeuchel pitched six scoreless innings, Ozzie Albies and Josh Donaldson homered, and the streaking Atlanta Braves picked up another division win over the Washington Nationals with a 4-3 victory on Friday night.\n\nThe NL East-leading Braves have won eight in a row, 19 of 23 overall and 12 consecutive at home, dropping Washington nine games back. It was Atlanta\u2019s fourth straight victory and eighth in 11 tries over the Nationals.\n\nKeuchel (7-5) allowed six hits and two walks and struck out three to win his fourth straight start. After posting a 6.10 ERA in his first two outings in the season series, the lefty protected a 2-0 lead in the sixth by striking out slugger Juan Soto with a runner on first, and getting Yan Gomes to ground out with runners on the corners.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m predicated on,\u201d said Keuchel, who is 4-0 with a 0.87 ERA over his last five starts. \u201cI make the hitter guess and I\u2019ve been guessing right for myself.\u201d\n\nNationals starter Patrick Corbin (11-7) walked a career-high six, issuing three consecutive passes before striking out Dansby Swanson, his last batter, to end the fifth. Corbin gave up three hits and two runs - one earned - with nine strikeouts.\n\nWashington, which began the four-game series badly needing to make up ground in the division, has lost four of five for the first time since July 30-Aug. 4.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still a confident group here,\u201d Corbin said. \u201cWe know how hot that they\u2019ve been, and we\u2019ll come back tomorrow and get over this one. We\u2019re still in good position to do stuff.\u201d\n\nThe Braves tacked on runs with Albies\u2019 20th homer in the third and Tyler Flowers\u2019 sacrifice fly RBI in the fourth.\n\nDonaldson, the self-proclaimed Bringer of Rain, broke out another umbrella celebration in the dugout after going deep for the 35th time, a two-run shot that made it 4-0 in the seventh.\n\nFans are joining in, too, as umbrellas are popping up around SunTrust Park during his at-bats.\n\n\u201cThe fan base has been remarkable all year long, showing up and supporting it us,\u201d Donaldson said. \u201cWe\u2019re winning a lot of games, so it\u2019s fun to be a part of.\u201d\n\nLuke Jackson allowed Ryan Zimmerman\u2019s fifth homer, a three-run shot that cut the lead to 4-3 in the eighth. Shane Greene earned his first save in three tries with Atlanta and 23rd overall after facing the minimum with two strikeouts in the ninth.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nNationals: RHP Joe Ross tweaked his forearm during a bullpen session this week and has been scratched from Saturday\u2019s start. \u2026 LHP Roenis El\u00edas still has too much swelling to undergo an MRI on his right hamstring. El\u00edas was injured Thursday. \u2026 INF Adr\u00edan Sanchez has a virus and was sent back to the team hotel to rest.\n\nBraves: RF Austin Riley was recalled from an injury-rehab assignment and went 0 for 3 with a strikeout. He had been sidelined since Aug. 5 with a right knee sprain.\n\nDAZZLING\n\nSwanson backhanded a grounder deep in the hole at short and jumped to throw out Trea Turner on a head-first slide at second and end the third. \u2026 The Nationals were solid in the field in the sixth. CF Michael Taylor threw out Flowers at the plate, and RHP Tanner Rainey picked off pinch-runner Billy Hamilton at second. \u2026 The home winning streak is Atlanta\u2019s best since the 2000 team also won 12 in a row. \u2026 The Braves improved to 40-21 against the NL East.\n\nGOOD AND BAD\n\nRendon\u2019s fielding error in the fourth allowed Adam Duvall to advance to third and later score on Flowers\u2019 fly, but Rendon singled in the eighth to reach safely in his 22nd straight game dating to Aug. 13.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNationals: RHP Austin Voth (1-0, 3.91 ERA) will replace Ross in the rotation and make his fifth start. Voth has pitched seven career innings and has allowed runs against Atlanta.\n\nBraves: RHP Julio Teheran (9-8, 3.38 ERA) will make his 30th start for the seventh straight season and is 1-0 with a 2.19 ERA in two outings against Washington this year.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Dallas Keuchel pitched six scoreless innings, Ozzie Albies and Josh Donaldson homered, and the streaking Atlanta Braves picked up another division win over the Washington Nationals on Friday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "George Henry"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/06/nationals_braves_baseball_07738_c0-169-4037-2522_s1770x1032.jpg?49c7b5691acced905890fee7a79ce11ab71d08bf", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
