According to the Wall Street Journal article that first broke the news about Greenland, Trump\u2019s interest was piqued when advisers spoke of the island\u2019s \u201cabundant resources and geopolitical importance.\u201d The reason those resources\u2014including reserves of coal and uranium\u2014are available for exploitation is because of Greenland\u2019s rapidly melting ice sheet. Its geopolitical importance has been greatly increased by the melting of Arctic Ocean ice, which has made new shipping routes accessible and opened up a new theater of strategic competition for the United States, Canada, Russia, the Nordic countries and, increasingly, China.\n\nTrump probably doesn\u2019t realize it, but he\u2019s not the first president in recent years to look at the coming impact of climate change and decide to buy land. And with dislocated populations and scarcer resources looming on the horizon, he might not be the last.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn 2014, the pacific island nation of Kiribati purchased 7.7 square miles of land of the Fijian island of Vanua Levu for a little less than $9 million. A nation of 33 low-lying atolls, Kiribati is one of the countries that\u2019s most vulnerable to sea level rise. According to the government\u2019s climate action plan, submitted to the 2015 U.N. Climate Change Conference in Paris, a substantial portion of Kirbati\u2019s capital island, Tarawa, where nearly half of its 110,000 people live, could be inundated by 2050. Smaller outlying islands could disappear even sooner.\n\nThen-President Anote Tong described the Fiji purchase as an insurance policy, telling the media, \u201cWe would hope not to put everyone on [this] one piece of land, but if it became absolutely necessary, yes, we could do it.\u201d At the Paris summit, Tong thanked the government of Fiji for opening the doors to his people.\n\nThe purchase made international headlines, with Kiribati described as the first country to purchase land abroad specifically for relocation because of climate change. But it was a little more complicated than that. For one thing, since the purchase, there\u2019s been little in the way of preparation for any mass relocation of Kirbati\u2019s population. The administration that followed Tong\u2019s is mostly dismissive of his plan. The government\u2019s story on what the land was intended for also changed several times\u2014sometimes it was described as for relocation, sometimes for agriculture to provide food security for Kiribati. The land itself consists of steep hills and mangrove swamps, not particularly suitable for either habitation or agriculture. It\u2019s also already home to several hundred Solomon Islanders who have lived there since the 19th century.\n\nWhen I interviewed Tong at his home in Tarawa in 2016 for my book, Invisible Countries, he told me, \u201cIt\u2019s a statement to the international community that our situation is serious. But, apart from that, it\u2019s a damn good investment.\u201d If all goes well, he told me in language that would likely make sense to the current, real estate-minded U.S. president, \u201cin 50 years we can sell the land.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Kiribati might offer a model for other countries. Food security in an increasingly crowded world could be another factor that drives governments to purchase land abroad. This is arguably already happening. Chinese state-run firms have been accused of a new \u201cland grab,\u201d having gobbled up agricultural land in Africa and Latin America. In 2008, the South Korean company Daewoo Logistics negotiated a lease on 3.2 million acres of farmland in Madagascar, nearly half the island\u2019s arable land. The deal was highly controversial and contributed to the protests that led to the overthrow of Madagascar\u2019s government in 2009.\n\nBut these deals and the Kiribati purchase differ in an important way from Trump\u2019s Greenland gambit: They did not actually involve the transfer of sovereignty from one country to another. The land in Fiji is still the territory of Fiji, even if the government of Kiribati owns it. The small population that lives on the land didn\u2019t suddenly become citizens of Kiribati overnight. It\u2019s more akin to the sovereign wealth funds of countries like Norway or Qatar gobbling up New York real estate. You don\u2019t need a passport to visit these buildings in Manhattan.\n\nThe actual purchase of sovereign territory was once relatively common. Blockbuster deals like the Louisiana Purchase, the Alaska Purchase and the Adams-On\u00eds treaty, through which Florida was acquired, were key to America\u2019s early territorial expansion. Today, this is almost unheard of. (One possible exception: In 2011, Tajikistan agreed to cede 386 square miles of territory to China under a deal, the terms of which were not publicized at the time.)\n\nWhy has the market for territory gotten so tight? In large part, it\u2019s because the world\u2019s landmass is now dominated not by large colonial empires, but by nation-states that zealously guard the territory they control. Moreover, thanks to prevailing notions like nationalism and popular sovereignty, the people who live within those nation-states expect to have some say in the matter of what country they live in.\n\nGermany learned this the hard way after 1871, when, after its victory in the Franco-Prussian war, it demanded payment from France in the form of real estate, as countless victorious powers had done since time immemorial. But even though the French government agreed to transfer the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, the people who lived there refused to accept that they were now Germans, and France nursed a grudge until it won the provinces back in World War I. Times had changed, and, as historian Martin Van Creveld has written, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck came to view the annexation as the worst mistake of his career.\n\nA century and a half later, Trump too wants to take over a territory whose people don\u2019t believe their sovereignty is something to be traded like poker chips between leaders hundreds of miles away; Greenland, though part of Denmark, is a semi-autonomous territory with its own government managing its domestic affairs. This isn\u2019t the first time Trump has expressed some premodern ideas about territorial conquest\u2014he has on several occasions argued that the United States should have \u201ckept the oil\u201d after invading Iraq\u2014but he\u2019s going to have a hard time finding negotiating partners for his expansionist dreams.\n\nStill, just because Trump\u2019s Greenland purchase is a nonstarter, doesn\u2019t mean our notions of territorial control won\u2019t get a little more fluid in the future, particularly as climate change physically reshapes the planet. Perhaps some countries will be forced to pick up and move. There\u2019s historical precedent for this. In his book, Vanished Kingdoms, the British historian Norman Davies identifies 15 different locations called \u201cBurgundy,\u201d dating back to the 5th century and occupying locations from the west bank of the Rhine to what is now Switzerland to the Netherlands. These countries more closely resembled family-run holding companies than a modern nation-state. But relocation is a pretty alien concept in a world where countries are first and foremost thought of as particular pieces of land.\n\nThe predicament of Kiribati and other low-lying island states has also prompted some environmental law scholars to propose ideas like \u201cex-situ nationhood,\u201d under which governments would maintain some level of political sovereignty and a role in international institutions, even after territory they used to represent becomes uninhabitable. These might end up looking less like currently existing states than entities like the Sovereign Order of Malta (not to be confused with the country of Malta)\u2014a religious order dating back to the Middle Ages that is recognized as politically sovereign by 106 countries and enjoys observer status at the United Nations, despite controlling no territory and having no citizens. The scenario might seem far-fetched, but traditional notions of sovereignty and citizenship might no longer hold up in a world of growing migrant populations and statelessness.\n\nIt probably wasn\u2019t what he had in mind, but Trump\u2019s Arctic dreams could point toward an era in which both the countries of the world and the physical land they sit on are a lot less fixed than they are now.\n\nThis article tagged under: Washington And The World", "description": "Trump probably doesn\u2019t realize it, but he\u2019s not the first president in recent years to look at the coming impact of climate change and decide to buy land.
