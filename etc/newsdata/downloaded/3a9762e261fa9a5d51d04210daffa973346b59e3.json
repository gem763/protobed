Mandatory Credit: Jeremy Brevard-USA TODAY Sports\n\nNewton missed multiple targets and consistently overthrew receivers Thursday in a 20-14 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Newton was 0-for-10 with three sacks against pressure by the Bucs according to NFL Next Gen Stats.\n\n\u201cThrough my lens, it\u2019s hard to look defensive guys in the eyes after a game like this,\u201d said Newton. \u201cOffensively, we didn\u2019t hold up our end of the bargain.\n\n\u201cAll fingers are just pointing back to me specifically on offense.\u2019\u2019\n\nNewton completed 24 of 50 pass attempts for 324 yards and zero touchdowns. The Panthers are 0-2 for the first time since 2013.\n\nDefenses are inviting Newton to throw the ball downfield, and he\u2019s missing those chances. He is 4-of-15 on throws that travel more than 15 yards downfield.\n\n\u201cI have to be better,\u201d Newton said. \u201cNo matter what physical condition I\u2019m in. No matter what foot, shoulder ... I didn\u2019t get the job done, and it\u2019s frustrating. I wish I could say something other than that, but that\u2019s the fact. I\u2019m a brutally honest person with people, and I\u2019m a brutally honest person with myself. And it\u2019s time for me to look myself in the mirror and do some real soul-searching, because I had opportunities tonight and I didn\u2019t get it done.\u201d\n\nNewton said his surgically repaired shoulder \u2014 and specifically his second operation on his right shoulder in January \u2014 is not a factor. Newton also sprained his foot in the third preseason game for the Panthers in August.\n\n\u201cI say it all the time,\u201d Newton said. \u201cSometimes, you find yourself in a blender, and the only person that can get yourself out is yourself.\u201d\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Carolina is 0-2 and quarterback Cam Newton wants the blame for the Panthers' poor start to the 2019 season.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429472639&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C1KQ-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
