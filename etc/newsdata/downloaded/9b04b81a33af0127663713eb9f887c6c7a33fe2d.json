Hopefully tomorrow a necropsy will be carried out to determine the cause of death #thameswhale #HumpbackWhale\n\nThe group had said there had been no sightings on Tuesday and appealed for information from people nearby.\n\nA team of three volunteers began tracking the animal on Sunday morning, saying it surfaced near them within about 30 minutes of their arrival in the area of the Dartford crossing in Kent.\n\n\u201cThe whale came into sight, slowly surfacing on the Dartford side of the bridge, and then diving again for around five minutes,\u201d they said. \u201cThis pattern continued for a further few hours and the team followed the whale\u2019s progress by land eastwards down the estuary.\n\n\u201cOnce the whale reached Grays on the Essex side of the estuary, it slowed down and didn\u2019t swim any further. The whale appeared to be moving at a steady pace, surfacing every five to six minutes and then diving again.\u201d\n\nThey said they had received reports that the animal was in trouble in shallow water and concluded it had travelled westwards with the incoming tide.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, BDMLR appealed for information but later confirmed that the animal had been seen dead at about 5pm.\n\nBDMLR (@BDMLR) The Cetacean Stranding Investigation Programme (CSIP) will carry out the necropsy as soon as it\u2019s possible, they will then publish their findings.\n\nThe humpback whale was thought by the Port of London Authority to measure around 10 metres (33ft) in length. The Port of London Authority will attempt to recover the animal\u2019s body for examinations by whale experts. A member of the species was spotted in the Channel last week, according to BDMLR, but it is not clear whether this was the same one.\n\nLast year, a beluga whale, nicknamed Benny the Beluga, spent more than three months in the Thames. It is thought to have made its own way back out to sea in the new year.", "description": "British Divers Marine Life Rescue says body spotted near Kent town", "authors": ["Kevin Rawlinson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7db7813cae04695de5e7c2d0720dce7b4430728/0_28_497_298/master/497.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=58d3bc93f37c087375581de38bb67b61", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
