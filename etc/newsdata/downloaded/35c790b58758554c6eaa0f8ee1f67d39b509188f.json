And a lot of people just have questions.\n\nHere are some answers.\n\nWhat does it mean to cancel someone?\n\nThe dictionary definition of \"cancel,\" per Merriam Webster, is to \"destroy the force, effectiveness or validity of.\"\n\nWhen people say they're canceling a famous person, that's essentially what they're trying to do. They want to take away their power or their cultural capital. They want to diminish their significance, whether it's a personal boycott or a public shaming.\n\nDoes canceling actually work?\n\nEh. It depends.\n\nWhen was the last time you saw Kevin Spacey in a new movie or on TV? When was the last time you heard anything about him that didn't involve allegations of misconduct?\n\nSince then, the only news about the actor has been on his sexual assault case.\n\nFilmmaker Woody Allen, who has been accused by daughter Dylan Farrow of sexually assaulting her, lost his movie deal with Amazon earlier this year. Roseanne Barr's TV show was canceled last year after she went on a racist Twitter rant. And Shane Gillis was fired from \"Saturday Night Live\" this month after some past racist jokes resurfaced.\n\nBut the truth is, most attempts at canceling someone don't really work like that. Many people, for example, have tried to cancel Taylor Swift over a series of perceived missteps. But she's still out there, making music. She's not really canceled, not in the way Spacey or Kelly are.\n\nWhat came next for West? Cancellation, right?\n\nThe truth is a bit more complicated. Some people certainly tried to cancel the rapper by swearing off his music and criticizing his viewpoints.\n\nBut let's be honest. Many other people still bump Ye's songs, and his recent Sunday Services have garnered huge crowds -- including actor Brad Pitt . Ultimately, Kanye proved just too big to cancel.\n\nWhat about Michael Jackson? How do you cancel a legend?\n\nThough the allegations of sexual assault surrounding Jackson are serious, can you really cancel someone whose influence runs so deep and who is so omnipresent?\n\nJenna Wortham, a culture writer for the New York Times, contemplated this question on the podcast \"Still Processing .\" She says she's managed to cut out such entertainers as Allen, Louis CK and Chris Brown -- but Jackson is still everywhere. His songs influenced generations of musicians. It simply isn't possible to totally cancel him.\n\n\"[Cancel culture] doesn't really work,\" Wortham says. \"You can't just cut problematic people and problematic cultural properties or entities out because it's whack-a-mole, right? You're dealing with the symptoms of a sick society rather than actually treating the disease.\"\n\nCanceling also doesn't undo the harm these people have done and doesn't prevent them from doing it again, Wortham says. She cities the example of Chris Brown , who assaulted then-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009 and continues to see musical success despite continued allegations of assault and rape\n\nThis, in a lot of ways, is what cancel culture has become. It's less about eradicating the offender and more about giving the offended a personal catharsis.\n\nIs cancel culture going too far?\n\nAfter old tweets surfaced last year that revealed homophobic language by Kevin Hart, fellow comedian Billy Eichner came to Hart's defense, saying people sometimes rush to judgment. Eichner said he doesn't like the culture of bringing up past tweets and using them against someone.\n\n\"I'm not into people being permanently 'cancelled' over something like this,\" he said on Twitter . \"To me, 'cancellation' is childish. I'm into conversation, not cancellation. I'm into owning up to past mistakes, acknowledging blindspots and hurtful remarks, talking through it, discussing it, learning, moving past it and making progress together.\"\n\nTo cancel someone immediately, Eichner is essentially saying, is denying them that opportunity to learn and grow.\n\nThat's easier to do when the problem is homophobic tweets from a long time ago.\n\nIt's tougher when the issue is bit more muddled. After Gillis was fired from \"SNL\" for racist jokes he made as recently as 2018, comedian Jim Jeffries said , \"This is just cancel culture. The guy shouldn't have been fired.\"\n\nMany people agreed with Jeffries. But others took an opposing stance, like author Mark Harris, who said, \"SNL reversing its decision to hire Shane Gillis isn't a triumph of cancel culture or political correctness or whatever else idiots will label it. It is the swift and appropriate rectification of a mistake.\"\n\nCancel culture, in most cases, isn't permanent. But it does let public figures know that fans will hold them accountable.", "description": "Name a celebrity who has ever said or done anything remotely controversial -- they've probably been canceled.
