He was 95.\n\nZimbabwe's former president Robert Mugabe looks on during a press conference at his private residence nicknamed \"Blue Roof\" in Harare, Zimbabwe, July 29, 2018. REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko\n\nHe was one of the most polarising figures in his continent\u2019s history, a giant of African liberation, whose rule finally ended in ignominy when he was overthrown by his own army. He died in Singapore, where he had long received medical treatment.\n\n\u201cIt is with the utmost sadness that I announce the passing on of Zimbabwe\u2019s founding father and former President, Cde (Comrade) Robert Mugabe,\u201d a post on President Emmerson Mnangagwa\u2019s official Twitter account said.\n\nMnangagwa cut short a trip to a World Economic Forum meeting in South Africa to return home, a government official said.\n\nTributes poured in from African leaders. South Africa\u2019s government mourned a \u201cfearless pan-Africanist liberation fighter\u201d. Kenya\u2019s President Uhuru Kenyatta hailed a \u201cman of courage who was never afraid to fight for what he believed in, even when it was not popular\u201d.\n\nAt home, even foes paid respects.\n\n\u201cHe was a colossus on the Zimbabwean stage and his enduring positive legacy will be his role in ending white minority rule & expanding a quality education to all Zimbabweans,\u201d tweeted David Coltart, an opposition senator and rights lawyer.\n\nBut others said his legacy was overshadowed by the harm he did to his people.\n\n\u201cWe of course express our condolences to those who mourn, but know that for many he was a barrier to a better future,\u201d said a spokeswoman for Boris Johnson, prime minister of Britain, Zimbabwe\u2019s former colonial power.\n\n\u201cUnder his rule the people of Zimbabwe suffered greatly as he impoverished their country and sanctioned the use of violence against them.\u201d\n\nOn the streets, the response was mostly more generous.\n\n\u201cHe was iconic, he was an African legend. His only mistake was that he overstayed in power. You can\u2019t have somebody that\u2019s 89 and 90 still being the president, you have to give others a chance,\u201d said Harare resident Onwell Samukanya.\n\n\u201cHe was a good leader,\u201d said another resident, Sellina Mugadza. \u201cOf course we know that you cannot do good to everyone, but to me he was good.\u201d\n\nCHAMPION OF RECONCILIATION WHO UNLEASHED DEATH SQUADS\n\nMugabe was feted as a champion of racial reconciliation when he first came to power in a nation throwing off white colonial rule. By the time he was toppled, he was viewed by many at home and abroad as a power-obsessed autocrat who unleashed death squads, rigged elections and ruined the economy to keep control.\n\nWhen he was ousted by his own armed forces in November 2017, there were wild celebrations across the country of 13 million.\n\nFor Mugabe, it was an \u201cunconstitutional and humiliating\u201d betrayal by his party and people. Confined to his sprawling \u201cBlue Roof\u201d Harare mansion, he stayed bitter to the end.\n\nMugabe took power in 1980 after seven years of a liberation bush war, with a reputation as \u201cthe thinking man\u2019s guerrilla\u201d. He held seven degrees, three earned behind bars as a political prisoner of then-Rhodesia\u2019s white minority rulers. Later, he would boast of another qualification: \u201ca degree in violence\u201d.\n\nJust three years after independence, he sent the army\u2019s North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade into the homeland of the Ndebele people to crush loyalists of his rival, Joshua Nkomo.\n\nOver the next two years, human rights groups estimate as many as 20,000 people died. The purge came to be known in the Shona language as Gukurahundi: \u201cthe early rain that washes away the chaff\u201d. The opposition called it genocide.\n\nVictims were executed, forced to dig their own graves or thrown down wells. Rape, torture, mass beatings and wholesale destruction of villages were commonplace, according to \u201cBreaking the Silence\u201d, a 1997 report by the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace.\n\nThough those killings never raised the international outcry of his later seizure of white-owned farms, they were his rule\u2019s darkest days. Many years later, he acknowledged the episode was \u201cvery bad\u201d and blamed it on renegade soldiers. Researchers say the evidence shows he knew what was happening all along.\n\nIn fiery speeches throughout his rule he painted his actions as a just response to a racist colonial legacy that concentrated wealth in white hands. When his followers seized white-owned farms, output cratered and southern Africa\u2019s breadbasket could barely feed itself. He blamed a conspiracy by a hostile West.\n\nAs the economy imploded and his health withered, he trusted fewer people. Foes suspected a plan to pass control to his young wife, who they called \u201cGucci Grace\u201d for her lavish lifestyle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the end of a very painful and sad chapter in the history of a young nation, in which a dictator, as he became old, surrendered his court to a gang of thieves around his wife,\u201d Chris Mutsvangwa, leader of Zimbabwe\u2019s influential liberation war veterans, told Reuters after Mugabe\u2019s removal.\n\nINHERITED A JEWEL\n\nBorn on Feb. 21, 1924, on a Roman Catholic mission near Harare, Mugabe was educated by Jesuit priests and worked as a primary school teacher before going to South Africa\u2019s University of Fort Hare, then a breeding ground for African nationalism.\n\nReturning to then-Rhodesia in 1960, he entered politics and was jailed four years later for a decade for opposing white rule. When his infant son died of malaria in Ghana in 1966, Mugabe was denied parole to attend the funeral, a decision that historians say added to Mugabe\u2019s subsequent bitterness.\n\nAfter his release, he rose to the top of the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army guerrilla movement.\n\n\u201cYou have inherited a jewel in Africa. Don\u2019t tarnish it,\u201d Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere told him during the independence celebrations in Harare.\n\nHis departure from power failed to lift Zimbabwe\u2019s economy, however, which remains in its worst economic crisis in a decade. Triple-digit inflation, rolling power cuts and shortages of U.S. dollars and basic goods have revived memories of the Mugabe era.", "description": "Robert Mugabe, the bush war guerrilla who led Zimbabwe to independence in 1980 and crushed his foes during nearly four decades of rule as his country descended into poverty, hyperinflation and unrest, died on Friday.
