Milan is also home to four five-star Sheraton hotels, such as the brand-new Milan San Siro. With its 310 well-appointed rooms, swimming pool, terraced garden, and 21 conference spaces, the Milan San Siro is an ideal home base both for work and play.\n\nHere's how to get the most out of your free time in Italy's big business center.\n\nSforza Castle (Castello Sforzesco)\n\nThe Sforza Castle is a 15th Century structure.

This 15th century structure is located in peaceful Parco Sempione, one of Milan's most popular parks for relaxing strolls or bike rides. Sforza Castle, home to the influential Sforza family during the Renaissance, houses museums containing priceless works of art, including masterpieces by Titian, Tintoretto, and Leonardo Da Vinci. Usually associated with Florence, Da Vinci actually spent the longest and most prolific stretch of his life in Milan. He was a frequent visitor to the court of Sforza, serving as costume artist and masque choreographer before designing the castle's Sala delle Asse (\"Room of Wooden Boards\"), inventing his flying machine, and painting \"Mona Lisa.\"\n\nThe Cathedral of Milan (Il Duomo di Milano)\n\nIt's definitely a tourist attraction, but Il Duomo is a must-see for a reason. Built (and reconstructed) in stages between 1386 and 1906, the massive marble cathedral is the largest Gothic structure in Italy. The bronze statue of the Madonnina (Virgin Mary) atop Il Duomo's highest spire has been a symbol for the city since its installation in 1774. The tourist crowds can be intense, but Il Duomo's beautiful piazza is great for people watching and catching musical performances. Il Duomo's museum, featuring 600 years' worth of liturgical art, is also well worth the visit.\n\nAperitivo at Terrazza Aperol\n\nCap off your day with a delicious Aperol Spritz.

Terrazza Aperol's hip crowd, live music, and views of Il Duomo make it a great place to experience aperitivo culture for yourself. Just head to the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II \u2014 an impressive 19th-century covered gallery of shops and caf\u00e9s right next to Il Duomo \u2014 and you'll find Terrazza Aperol on the second floor. Refreshing cocktails and an assortment of Italian-style snacks like olives, mini pizzas, and pasta salad make the aperitivo the perfect antidote for any busy workday. Whether you stay past one drink or cab it to one of Milan's terrific nightlife districts like i Navigli or Corso Como, be sure to enjoy a neon-orange Aperol spritz. And always look at your drinking companions when you toast. Salute!\n\nThe Brera District\n\nHome to the Brera Art Gallery (Pinacoteca) and Brera Palace, the cool, artsy neighborhood of Brera is a local favorite. Even though it's within walking distance of Il Duomo and Sforza Castle, its pedestrian-friendly cobblestone streets and lush greenery give it a slightly bohemian feel. Its many caf\u00e9s, art galleries, and fashionable boutiques make it feel like its own separate community and a great place to get lost and forget about your full meeting schedule.\n\nEating as the Milanese eat\n\nOsso buco is a must-eat dish when in Milan. Getty Images While many cosmopolitan Milan dwellers enjoy eating out at international restaurants, trying Milan's traditional cuisine is essential. Ristorante Nabucco in Brera offers upscale versions of Milanese classics. Try the polenta with gorgonzola and porcini mushrooms, or a plate of earthy osso buco (cross-cut veal shanks) paired with saffron-infused risotto alla Milanese. Silene Restaurant at the Sheraton Milan San Siro is another great place to try Northern Italian cuisine made with fresh ingredients and foraged herbs.\n\nFor lighter, re-interpreted Mediterranean fare, the club at the Sheraton Diana Majestic is another excellent choice. Wherever you dine, a bitter, herby shot of Amaro Ramazzotti \u2014 Milan's famous digestive liqueur \u2014 is essential for helping you get a good night's sleep.\n\nBook a room at a Sheraton in Milan: The Diana Majestic, the Milan San Siro, and Milan Malpensa Airport and Conference Center.\n\nThis post was created by Insider Studios with Sheraton Hotels.", "description": "Milan may be one of Europe's biggest financial centers, but there's also plenty to do for fun, too \u2014 from dining to culture.", "authors": ["Sponsor Post", "Created Insider Studios With Sheraton Hotels"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d55aeeecd97844610397806?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
