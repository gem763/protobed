He passed for 348 yards with no interceptions and was named the conference\u2019s top quarterback of the week for the third time this season.\n\nFor North Carolina offensive coordinator Phil Longo, it\u2019s more proof that Howell is no ordinary first-year quarterback. He said Howell is \u201cbeyond the 101 stage\u201d of lessons.\n\n\u201cI mean, Sam, he studies the game, he cares, he\u2019s passionate about it,\u201d Longo said Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s all part of what makes him as good as he is right now, and we still have things we need to get better at. But I really like where the process is and I like the fact that he accepts just about every challenge I give him.\u201d\n\nHowell was a unanimous selection for the ACC\u2019s top freshman of the first half of the season in balloting by The Associated Press writers covering the conference. It was the only unanimous vote of nine categories.\n\nHe has set a school record for touchdown passes by a freshman while throwing only three interceptions. He is a key to coach Mack Brown\u2019s rebuilding effort at North Carolina (3-4, 2-2 ACC) entering Saturday\u2019s game against Duke (4-3, 2-2).\n\nIn addition to Howell\u2019s sweep of the top freshman vote, here are some of the ACC\u2019s best - and worst - of the season so far in voting by AP writers:\n\nCOACH OF THE FIRST HALF\n\nDave Clawson, Wake Forest. Clawson\u2019s Demon Deacons, picked to finish sixth in the Atlantic, are 6-1 overall, 2-1 in the ACC and ranked No. 25. Also receiving votes: Scott Satterfield, Louisville; Dabo Swinney, Clemson.\n\nOFFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE FIRST HALF\n\nJamie Newman, QB, Wake Forest. Newman leads the league in passing efficiency and his average of 295.3 yards passing per game. Also receiving votes: Travis Etienne, RB, Clemson; AJ Dillon, RB, Boston College; Sage Surratt, WR, Wake Forest; Howell.\n\nDEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE FIRST HALF\n\nIsaiah Simmons, LB, Clemson. Simmons, a junior, leads the Tigers with 5 1/2 sacks and 49 tackles. He ranks among the league\u2019s top six leaders in tackles, tackles for loss and sacks. Also receiving votes: Rayshard Ashby, LB, Virginia Tech; Jaylen Twyman, DT, Pittsburgh.\n\nMOST SURPRISING TEAM\n\nComing off a 2-10 season, Louisville (4-3, 2-2) edged Wake Forest as the biggest surprise of the first half. Led by first-year coach Satterfield, the former Appalachian State coach, Louisville took wins over Boston College and Wake Forest in consecutive weeks. Also receiving votes: Wake Forest, North Carolina, Pittsburgh.\n\nMOST SURPRISING PLAYER\n\nSurratt. A dominant season for the third-year sophomore continued when he had seven catches for 170 yards in a 22-20 win over Florida State last week. He already has four games with at least 150 yards this season and leads the league in most receiving statistics, including nine scoring catches. Also receiving votes: Howell, Newman.\n\nMOST DISAPPOINTING TEAM\n\nSyracuse (3-4, 0-3) is the only team without an ACC win. This follows a 10-win season in 2018. Coach Dino Babers is encouraged the Orange have been close in most games. He said there could be lineup changes in this week\u2019s game against Florida State. Also receiving votes: Miami.\n\nHOTTEST SEAT\n\nWillie Taggart, Florida State. The loss to Wake Forest last week left the Seminoles (3-4, 2-3) with losing records overall and in the conference for the second straight season. He is 8-11 in two seasons at Florida State. Also receiving votes: Steve Addazio, Boston College.\n\nBIGGEST INJURY\n\nBryce Hall, CB, Virginia. Hall led the nation in 22 pass breakups last season. He was a preseason year and a midseason All-America pick this season despite suffering a season-ending ankle injury in a loss at Miami on Oct. 11. Also receiving votes: Anthony Brown, QB, Boston College.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Sam Howell has moved well past freshman-level studies at North Carolina.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Charles Odum"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/23/north_carolina_virginia_tech_football_51929_c0-1204-2850-2866_s1200x700.jpg?3ebb2796f19d9cccb03c83ccdc8ec17a0e1a1fd5", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
