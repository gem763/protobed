For this look, makeup artist Nini recommends applying a layer of foundation before buffing on a peach-toned blush and bronzer to add warmth to the face and subtly sharpen your features (you know, so they\u2019re more cat like).\n\nStep 2: Next, using a black liquid lipstick and a fine-tipped brush, draw a smattering of dots just above the mouth on either side; then, paint on short, horizontal whiskers. Reload your brush with lipstick and color in the tip of your nose and around the nostrils. Line and fill in your upper lip with the lipstick, extending the lines just a centimeter or two from the corners of your mouth to elongate the shape.\n\nStep 3: Finish with a strong cat-eye flick using a liquid black eyeliner. Set it with black eyeshadow to soften any uneven lines, and practice your best smize.\n\nPro tip: A bit of cold cream (or eye cream) and a pointed Q-tip can clean up any mistakes or shaky lines.\n\nGet the look: Morphe M173 Mini Buffer Brush ($6); Anastasia Beverly Hills Matte Lipstick in \u201cMidnight\u201d ($18); Stila Stay All Day Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner ($22); It Brushes Velvet Luxe Precision Eyeliner Brush #326 ($24); Urban Decay Naked 2 Basics Palette ($29)\n\nView photos\n\nIntermediate Cat Look\n\nStep 1: For the smoothest application, always start with fresh, well-moisturized skin. Makeup artist Nick Scalzo used a face cream, eye cream, lip balm and primer on Alex before moving onto her eyes.\n\nStep 2: For the eyes, prep the lids with a neutral, flesh-toned cream shadow. Then, using another eye shadow that\u2019s two to three shades darker than your complexion, sweep it over the creases to add a soft definition to the lids. Next, apply a peachy-pink shadow over the creases and blend up toward your brows to add warmth.", "description": "When it comes to Halloween, people tend to fall into two categories: the die-hards (you know, the ones who go full out and plan every intricate detail of their costume for months) and, uh, the rest of us.
