Investors are still mulling over the ISM manufacturing numbers, which were the weakest numbers in a decade. I would go as far as to say the ISM manufacturing number will be revised higher, as a percentage is GM related noise (if strike is resolved before next survey).\n\nOctober is historically a volatile month, and this year is starting out the same way. Intriguingly, according to Bespoke Investment Group, going back 100 years, when October 1 is off more than 1%, eight out of twelve times, or 75% of the time, the month of October sees an average monthly gain of 3.75%, and eleven out of twelve times the rest of the year sees a 7.22% gain.\n\nOn the jobs front, private sector non-farm payroll added 135, 000 jobs in September. August was revised lower by 38,000 to 157,000. According to Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute, \u201cThe job market has shown signs of a slowdown. \u201d He added, \u201cThe average monthly job growth for the past three months is 145,000, down from 214,000 for the same time period last year.\u201d\n\nIn keeping with the ISM report yesterday, Manufacturing only created 2,000 jobs. The highest expansion was seen in the Education and Healthcare sector.\n\nGood Producing Service Producing Mining -3,000 Trade, Tran & Utility +28,000 Construction +9,000 Information +5,000 Manufacturing +2,000 Financial Activities +8,000 Professional & Business +20,000 Education & Health +42,000 Leisure & Hospitality +18,000 Other +5,000\n\nSmall businesses, a key component for job growth, was the laggard, while large companies made up for the bulk of the gains. Chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, Mark Zandi said, \u201cBusinesses have turned more cautious in their hiring. Small businesses have become especially hesitant. If businesses pull back any further, unemployment will begin to rise.\u201d\n\nBusiness Size Change Small 1-49 Employees 30,000 Midsize 50-499 Employees 39,000 Large 500 or more Employees 67,000\n\nTomorrow, we get the ISM Non-Manufacturing report, and on Friday, all eyes will be on the payroll report.\n\nPortfolio Approach\n\nYesterday, we took profits in Materials and Industrial. Materials were the outperformers, and we are reviewing our holdings in that sector for potential additional changes.
