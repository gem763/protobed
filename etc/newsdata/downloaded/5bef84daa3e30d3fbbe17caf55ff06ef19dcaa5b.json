The building had already been seen burning during rioting on Saturday.\n\nThe protesters are demanding that President Moreno roll back his sweeping austerity policies, introduced as part of an International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan package.\n\nAlso on rt.com US-oriented IMF & its austerity package guilty of chaos in Ecuador \u2013 ex-Central Bank official to RT\n\nResponding to the influx of angry protesters into the capital, many of whom wreaked havoc on government buildings and clashed with police during nearly two weeks of unrest, Moreno on Saturday imposed a curfew, put Quito under military control and announced a 24-hour restriction on all movement in the country.\n\nThe president, whose government has already evacuated the capital for the safety of the city of Guayaquil, also told Quito's mayor he\u2019ll \u201creconsider\u201d the cancellation of fuel subsidies, a measure which proved to be especially harmful to the population.\n\nThe military on Sunday announced that it was lifting the curfew in most of the city, with restricted movement only in some parts of the northern district.\n\nIt also vowed to ensure the safety of indigenous protest leaders from the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE) during the first round of talks with the government, which had been scheduled to take place later on Sunday. The negotiations were agreed after ten days of unrest in the capital.\n\nSeven people have been killed and over 1,300 wounded since the protests broke out on October 3, according to public ombudsman's office. The police have arrested over 1,150 demonstrators.\n\nAhead of the talks, CONAIE said on Twitter that the president should fully reinstate the fuel subsidies or the protests in Quito and elsewhere in the country will continue.\n\nThe protest leaders also demanded that the talks be transparent, saying that they\u2019ll be broadcast live on huge screens so that the whole country could see what\u2019s going on.\n\nAusterity measures were introduced by Moreno in order to meet the conditions of a $4.2 billion loan deal with the IMF.
