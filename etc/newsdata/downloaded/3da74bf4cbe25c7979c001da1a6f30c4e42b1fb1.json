Protesters carried signs with slogans including \u201cfreedom to the students, freedom to the universities\u201d and \u201cyou don\u2019t have enough prisons to hold everyone opposed to this government\u201d.\n\nRussian police carry out mass raids against opposition activists Read more\n\nRussian prosecutors opened a broad criminal case against protesters for rioting at demonstrations against rigged city council elections, a relatively minor poll that became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre among the Russian opposition beginning in June. While a public backlash has forced the prosecutors to drop many of the charges, 17 people have been sentenced or remain under investigation.\n\nAlexey Minyaylo said in a speech that in jail \u201cthey take away your shoelaces, your belt. But they can\u2019t take some things away from people: honour, dignity, conscience, freedom.\u201d Minyaylo was released from custody this week after prosecutors dropped rioting charges against him.\n\nThe summer\u2019s protests were marked by mass arrests, with more than 1,000 people detained on consecutive weekends in July and August.
