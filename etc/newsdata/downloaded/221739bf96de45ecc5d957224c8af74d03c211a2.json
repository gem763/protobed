( VTR ) in Wednesday night's Mad Money program. Let's check out the charts and indicators of this real estate investment trust that invests primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of VTR, below, we can see a step-like rally the past 12 months. Prices rally for a step up and then go sideways before another step to the upside. VTR is currently above the rising 50-day moving average line as well as the bullish 200-day moving average line.\n\nThe performance of the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line is a little problematic as it hardly rises the past 12 months and has weakened slightly in September. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is above the zero line but the two moving averages that make up this indicator are on top of each other and could easily turn up or down to a buy or a sell.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of VTR, below, we can see a more positive picture. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line is more positive looking than the daily line and has been in a strong uptrend from early 2018. The weekly MACD is above the zero line and pointed up.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of VTR we can see a projected upside price target of $91.\n\nBottom-line strategy: Our three charts of VTR (above) look positive so traders could go long VTR near $72 risking a close below $69. The $90 area is our price objective.", "description": "Healthcare REIT Ventas Has a Healthy Looking Setup...VTR", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Healthcare Reit Ventas Has A Healthy Looking Setup", "Three Charts Of Vtr Look Positive.
