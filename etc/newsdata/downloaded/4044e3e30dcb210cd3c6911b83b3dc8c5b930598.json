They lose all democratic rights as UK citizens despite having committed no crime. For those of us living in EU countries we have no say about the issue that affects us most \u2013 Brexit. Time for an urgent amendment to the proposed one-line bill.\n\nLynn Atterbury\n\nPoland\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

This is the act of a dictator. Do what I say not what my country\u2019s parliament says, pleading with the EU to use his own type of bully boy tactics.\n\n\n\nThe EU is open, welcoming and has always said it regrets the UK\u2019s decision to leave. Why would it feed into Boris Johnson\u2019s agenda to leave the EU come-what-may albeit with a new come-what-may date?\n\n\n\nThe EU council could politely reply to the British PM saying that if the withdrawal agreement has not been passed by Westminster by 31 January then it would treat the invoking of Article 50 as null and void as it had been unsuccessful.\n\nKicking and screaming shouldn\u2019t get the child what he or she wants, especially when a mature parent is dealing with the child. The deliberations of the EU represents a mature parent while the British prime minister represents the recalcitrant child.\n\nAlison Hackett\n\nDublin\n\nDo the honourable thing, Boris\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s pledge to leave the EU at the end of October of \u201cdo or die\u201d will now be broken. The only reason the Prime Minister was allowed to secure his current position was because we are all totally \u201cbrexhausted\u201d and wished to remove the languishing no-deal Brexit uncertainty in the market. Mr Johnson\u2019s position now is untenable and the only honourable thing that he can do now is resign or fall on his sword.\n\nChristopher Learmont-Hughes\n\nWirral\u200b\n\nThree years of Brexit deadlock\n\nI voted to leave but I am even more determined that we should do so after the last three years of scandalous refusal to accept the democratic decision made by the public. Get us out \u2013 preferably without the outrageous conditions of the so called deals.\n\nBryan Huckvale\n\nWarwickshire\n\nHow to avoid another Grenfell\n\nIt was reported that a cherry picker was used to attempt a rescue of a man trapped on top of a 290ft chimney. As many tower blocks like Grenfell (221ft high) are well within that reach, might it not be considered that all fire brigades with tower blocks in their area be equipped or have ready access to such equipment, not only for rescue but for effective firefighting at these heights?\n\nG Forward\n\nStirling", "description": "What percentage of those who voted to leave the EU assumed we would just negotiate a date to leave and that would be that?
