Look for it at the railway\u2019s lost-and-found market", "language": "en", "text": "By Oona McGee, SoraNews24\n\nWith trains in Japan ranking as the busiest in the world, lost-and-found offices at terminal stations can be filled with all sorts of unusual items. They can\u2019t be held there forever, though, so after a set amount of time, unclaimed items get auctioned off to independent sellers, who then sell them on to the public at a Tetsudo Wasuremono Ichi, which translates to Railway Lost Items Market.\n\nIt\u2019s not every day that you get to stumble upon one of these markets \u2014 which sometimes go by slightly different names \u2014 but the other day we found ourselves walking by one inside our local shopping centre, so we stopped to take a look at what type of items were available. According to the signboard, there was a huge variety of items on offer, with prices starting at just 50 yen.\n\nAt the lowest end of the price spectrum were piles and piles of umbrellas, in all sorts of colors and designs.\n\nWith many priced at less than 100 yen, and others selling for about 500 yen on average, customers could be heard expressing their disbelief at the fantastic condition of the stylish items.\n\nThere was a separate section for famous brand-name umbrellas as well, and although they were more expensive, they were still far cheaper than buying them brand new.\n\n\u25bc More bargains were to be found in the \u201cvarious cord\u201d boxes.\n\n\u25bc There were plenty of earphones here, priced from just 80 yen each.\n\n\u25bc There were plenty of jackets.\n\n\u25bc With so many small items to sift through, it was like hunting for treasure.\n\n\u25bc There were books.\n\n\u25bc Glasses and sunglasses.\n\n\u25bc Pens and markers\n\n\u25bc A tricycle stroller\n\nAt the more expensive end of the scale were drink flasks, which seemed a bit highly priced, given these were used and once had strangers\u2019 mouths on them.\n\n\u25bc There was also a guitar.\n\n\u25bc Belts\n\n\u25bc And jewelry and watches, with brand-name watches marked as \u201cnew\u201d for 11,000 yen.\n\nIf you\u2019re a bargain hunter who loves an unusual second-hand market, be sure to keep an eye out for a Tetsudo Wasuremono Ichi near you. One person\u2019s forgotten item is another person\u2019s treasure, especially if it\u2019s some of the 25,525,693 yen in cash left behind on Japanese trains in 2015.\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- The weird and wonderful things people leave behind on Japanese trains\n\n-- We coordinate a head-to-toe look for just 1,000 yen\n\n-- Nyaran the travel mascot cat goes edible and the results melt our hearts!\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/10/16/lost-something-on-a-japanese-train-look-for-it-at-the-railways-lost-and-found-market/\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24", "description": "With trains in Japan ranking as the busiest in the world, lost-and-found offices at terminal stations can be filled with all sorts of unusual items.
