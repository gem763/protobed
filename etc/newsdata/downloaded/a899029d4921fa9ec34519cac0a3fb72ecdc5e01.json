So on Saturday, they took out another.\n\nSo distrustful have lawmakers become of their famously brazen prime minister \u2014 and of one another \u2014 that they voted on Saturday not to vote at all on Mr. Johnson\u2019s much-heralded Brexit plan.\n\nThey had already passed a law to prevent the prime minister from abruptly pulling Britain out of the European Union without a deal managing future relations. But on Saturday they went further, saying that even the deal that Mr. Johnson had struck with the European Union was not a strong enough guarantee that Britain would not leave without one.\n\nSo they bought themselves a second layer of protection against such an outcome, forcing the government to ask for an extension and putting off the fateful decision on his deal until a no-deal departure was a more remote possibility.", "description": "In thwarting a Brexit vote, lawmakers seek extra insurance against an abrupt departure from the European Union without a deal to shape future relations.", "authors": ["Benjamin Mueller"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/20/world/20brexit-trust/19brexit-trust-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
