Guyger was convicted three days earlier in the death of her neighbor, Botham Jean, whose apartment she said she mistook for her own.\n\nBrown, who lived in the same apartment building, had testified about what he\u2019d heard that night. Lee Merritt, an attorney representing Brown\u2019s family, said Brown\u2019s mother told him about her son\u2019s reservations about his visibility in the high-profile trial. In November, Brown was wounded in the foot in a shooting that left a 25-year-old man dead outside a Dallas nightclub, The Dallas Morning News reports.\n\n\u201cHe was concerned that the people who shot him there still wanted to do him additional harm,\u201d said Merritt, who also represents Jean\u2019s family.\n\nDallas Mayor Eric Johnson and other officials have asked the public refrain from speculating about the killing of Brown while police investigate. Meanwhile, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. requested an independent investigation into Brown\u2019s slaying, calling it \u201cdeeply alarming and highly suspicious\u201d in a news release.\n\nDallas police had no comment on calls for an independent investigation.\n\nGuyger testified that in September 2018, after working a long shift, she mistook Jean\u2019s apartment for her own and thought he was a burglar. She was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nAt the time of Jean\u2019s shooting, Brown lived in the same apartment building as Guyger and Jean. Authorities say Brown was killed at a different complex.\n\nBrown testified that on the night of Jean\u2019s killing, he was in a hallway on the fourth floor, where he and Jean lived, and that he heard what sounded like \u201ctwo people meeting by surprise\u201d and then two gunshots.\n\nAt times during his testimony, Brown became emotional and used his T-shirt and tissue to wipe away tears. He said he had met Jean, a 26-year-old accountant from the Caribbean island nation of St. Lucia, for the first time earlier that day.\n\nJudge Tammy Kemp, who presided over Guyger\u2019s trial, said Monday that she was \u201csaddened\u201d and \u201cstunned\u201d to hear about Brown\u2019s death, adding that \u201che seemed to be a very compassionate young man and I hate that his life has ended so soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that we need to let the investigation of his death go forward,\u201d Kemp told The Associated Press during her first interview since last week\u2019s verdict.\n\nU.S. Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson likewise said the city police must be allowed to do their work and that she \u201cwill keep a very close eye on the Brown investigation and all aspects of this terrible crime.\u201d\n\nBrown testified that he was originally from Jacksonville, Florida, and had moved to Texas in 2008. He testified he graduated from the University of South Florida, where he played football from 2012 to 2013.\n\nUSF said in a statement that Brown was \u201ca much loved and valued member of our football program and athletic family.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Jake Bleiberg contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A man who was slain after testifying in the murder trial of a former Dallas police officer had feared being a witness because of another incident in which he was shot and wounded outside a nightclub, an attorney for his family said Monday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jamie Stengle"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/05/dallas_officer_mistaken_apartment_witness_77486_c0-0-5296-3088_s1770x1032.jpg?7b679f71553e28a781a9c8c5467bb68220cf051d", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
