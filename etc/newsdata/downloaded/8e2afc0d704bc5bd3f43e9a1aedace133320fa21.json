It was a hot, sticky Saturday in July, and I\u2019d been out running errands in my air conditioner-less car. Recycling, hardware store, groceries...It was time for a cold beer.\n\nI stopped at the border liquor store before returning home to the dry county of Hardin. The cashier weighed my empty milk jug, I filled it with draft Schlitz, and she weighed it again\u2014the store sold beer by the pound.\n\nWhen I got home, I opened the jug and started drinking. I put away the groceries, and decided I needed a shower. On a whim, I took the beer along. It wasn\u2019t long till I was soaped up, hot water rinsing off the day. I grabbed the jug, and tilted it back. Hot water pounding on my back, cold beer running down my throat. Wow! I\u2019d found a whole new experience. The shower beer!\n\nWas it a new thing? Well, probably not all that new, but, to be honest, I have had a hard time finding citations dating back more than 15 years. I did turn up this interesting reference in Nora Roberts\u2019s 2011 Chasing Fire, her book about randy smokejumpers: \u201cI want a beer. I want a giant, ice-cold bottle of beer and shower sex.\u201d There\u2019s a not unexpected angle, but, anybody who has had a shower beer, knows a bottle isn\u2019t really ideal.\n\nGoogle does show an interesting spike in use of the term \u201cshower beer\u201d in 2006, and it\u2019s been steady or growing ever since. Starting around 2012, there are a fair number of stories on the Web about the phenomenon. Then there\u2019s a subreddit, r/showerbeer, that\u2019s just selfies of people and their shower beers (some NSFW, but most just joyful drinking shots) with more than 100,000 subscribers.\n\nWhich reminds me: Before we delve into this much further, you need to know that if you start looking at \u201cshower beer\u201d on the Web, you\u2019re going to see things that you just can\u2019t, well, unsee. Like a big naked guy in a shower, clutching a keg to his belly, blasting the tap right into his manically-smiling face. Like the sad-eyed (and dripping wet) woman mourning her dead friend with a shower boilermaker of beer and Jack Daniel\u2019s. Like the couple who are clearly...um\u2026yeah. Them. Ready? Onward!\n\nIt\u2019s 2019, so there are lists of \u201cbest shower beers\u201d that give zero reasons why these beers are good for the bathroom. There are, God help me, pieces on beer-shower \u201cpairings,\u201d as if some beers are better for certain kinds of showers or shampoos. If shower beers weren\u2019t so simple and primal, they\u2019d have jumped the shark long ago, but they\u2019re, thankfully, immune to it.\n\nThere are beers that are certainly trying to cash in on the trend, calling themselves simply \u201cShower Beer\u201d or some bathing-related variation. Oddly, the one brand that got the most press by far is a Swedish beer that is actually all wrong for this scenario. Strike one: It\u2019s 10 percent ABV. Way too strong for shower drinking (though I did once shower-pound a 9.5 percent imperial stout after an hour of shoveling snow). Strike two: It\u2019s in a tiny 180-ml bottle. Even at 10 percent, that\u2019s just not enough beer. Who wants to worry about rationing the beer so you don\u2019t run out before you get to washing your hair? And strike three: It comes in a damn glass bottle. As bartender and writer Xania V. Woodman once put it: \u201cNever bottles. Glass and naked don\u2019t mix.\u201d\n\nAs I polled more colleagues like Xania\u2014writers, brewers, bartenders, musicians\u2014I learned more things. For instance, a fair number of brewers rejected the idea of shower beer altogether. Why? \u201cThat\u2019s a waste of water,\u201d said one. \u201cGet in, wash up, get out.\u201d Water is precious to brewers, and I respect that.\n\nFortunately, there is a solution. \u201cI drink slow but shower fast,\u201d says Teri Fahrendorf, long-time brewer and founder of the Pink Boots Society, an association of women brewers. So, \u201cI\u2019d rather drink in the bathtub.\u201d Or as Lee Lord, who brews at Cambridge Brewing in Massachusetts, prefers: \u201cbubble baths and Adnam\u2019s Tally Ho\u201d barley wine.\n\nBut what shocked me most when I reported out this story was that almost half the people I talked to either had no idea that shower beer was actually something people did, or flat out found it disgusting. \u201cEwwww!\u201d was a common reaction. When I dug into this opinion, I found three general dissenting arguments and I can crush all of them like an empty can of Narragansett on a shark boat.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want water/soapy water in my beer!\u201d Well, who does? You can easily avoid this problem by sticking your head out of the stream and tilting it back before you drink. Water flows away from the beer: problem solved. If the water\u2019s coming from all directions because you have a rain shower...you probably don\u2019t even need a shower beer, you lucky sucker.\n\n\u201cThe beer will get warm!\u201d The ideal scenario is an ice-cold beer in a shower as hot as you can stand. Shower beer is reckless and wild, and should be enjoyed with gulping abandon. So, you don\u2019t want to nurse your drink here.\n\n\u201cThe bottle will break!\u201d So many different kinds of beers come in cans these days, you can have pretty much anything you want, from pale lager to pastry stout to cucumber gose. Just skip the bottle.\n\nAll of these issues, by the way, are neatly addressed by a ridiculously simple little invention called the Shakoolie, invented by Zach Walsh and Phil Novara. It\u2019s a can-sized cooler with a suction cup on the side, so you can safely put it on the wall while you wash. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard not to feel good about that,\u201d said Walsh.\n\nHowever, there is a darker side of shower beer that I must address. One long-time brewer was quite firm about it: \u201cThe \u2018shower beer\u2019 strikes me as the purest representation of alcoholism I can imagine.\u201d He wasn\u2019t the only one to make that connection. And given the way popping a Schlitz at the bathroom sink was used to portray Chief Hopper\u2019s descent into dissolution in season one of Stranger Things, there\u2019s apparently something very bad about drinking in the bathroom.\n\nWhen enjoyed responsibly, I don\u2019t think a shower beer is necessarily a call for help. A morning shower beer before work is not a great idea. But if you\u2019re showering in the evening before going out, or after a long shift at work, surely it\u2019s okay to have a beer before you hop in the rain closet and no one can fault you for having one after you\u2019ve scrubbed up. So, what\u2019s so dangerous about the 10 to 15 minutes in between?\n\nThere may not be a way to convince people of the wonder of a cold beer in a hot shower. But there\u2019s a special place in my steamy, beer-cooled heart for enablers like the Shakoolie boys, and the folks at BrewDog, the Scottish-based brewery. They recently opened a BrewDog hotel, called the DogHouse, in Columbus, Ohio, (where they opened their U.S. brewery). Not only does each guest room have a tap that features the guest\u2019s choice of beers, there is a wall-mount refrigerator of BrewDog beers\u2013in cans, naturally\u2013beside each shower. A toss of the soapy locks to you, BrewDog!\n\nThe shower beer isn\u2019t going away\u2014especially with a 100,000 devoted Reddit fans. I enjoy one nearly every time I shower past noon. It\u2019s just too much fun. As a friend in the beer biz put it, after joyfully describing how much he enjoyed shower beers: \u201cI think it\u2019s also a chance to get naked and drink without being judged.\u201d\n\nWell put, fella.
