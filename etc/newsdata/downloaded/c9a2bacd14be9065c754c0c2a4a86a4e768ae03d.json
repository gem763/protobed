Which I assume means that even when IGN and whoever put there\u2019s out it will be Friday anyway, once the game is out. That Activision hasn\u2019t sent a review copy to GC, and I imagine many others, says a lot about not only how Activision thinks of the press but also its customers.\n\nI\u2019m sure the game is at least pretty good so they only reason they\u2019re holding back reviews is that they don\u2019t want to risk any bad publicity and if there is anything bad about the game they don\u2019t want people finding out until after it\u2019s out. I find that disgusting to be honest and it\u2019s the one thing that\u2019s put me off the game the most. That and their trick of adding microtransactions to a game months after it\u2019s out and it\u2019s already got its reviews/age rating.\n\nAs other people have said about big publishers \u2013 because it\u2019s not just Activision \u2013 I don\u2019t know why they can\u2019t just make a good game and just sell it on its own merits. Let people give you money because they appreciate the thing you\u2019ve made, not because you\u2019ve tricked them into spending money before they knew the full facts.\n\nFor these reasons I will not be getting the game this week. I will also wait for Black Friday. That\u2019s what Activision\u2019s policies have inspired me to do. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m a minority and the game will be a huge success from the off, but personally I\u2019m not willing to reward their anti-consumer policies.\n\nZebra", "description": "The Friday Inbox discusses the problems of replaying a story-based video game, as one reader praises Dragon Quest XI\u2019s post-game content.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/3184_17_1760_s20190626-016JR2-2abb_1571960758.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
