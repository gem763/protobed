Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2019 Report\n\nThe Democratic-led impeachment inquiry is trying to establish whether the Republican president withheld nearly $400m in aid to nudge Ukraine's president into launching an inquiry into Mr Biden, whose son, Hunter Biden, was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nIn a phone call on 25 July, Mr Trump asked the newly elected Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the former US vice-president, who is a leading Democratic White House contender in next year's election.\n\nA whistleblower raised concerns about the phone call, and the Democratic leader of the House of Representatives, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, announced a formal impeachment investigation last month.\n\nIn a statement released through his lawyer, Mr Sondland said he was \"profoundly disappointed\" he would not be able to testify.\n\n\"Ambassador Sondland believes strongly that he acted at all times in the best interests of the United States, and he stands ready to answer the Committee's questions fully and truthfully,\" said the statement.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims\n\nStalemate\n\nThis should just about settle it. The Trump administration is not going to co-operate with the congressional impeachment inquiry. Not at all. Not one bit.\n\nThat shouldn't come as a huge surprise, since the president himself has asserted that the entire investigation is illegitimate and the State Department has already objected to its employees testifying before Congress. Instructing EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland to cancel his deposition just hours before he was scheduled to appear, however, is particularly confrontational. It's sure to enflame the already heightened tensions between Congress and the White House.\n\nHouse Democrats were keen to press Sondland on recently revealed text messages that showed he worked with other administration diplomats to encourage Ukraine to investigate an energy company with ties to Joe Biden's son. They also may have been curious to find out why the Republican-donor-turned-EU-ambassador was even involved in diplomacy with a nation that is not part of the EU.\n\nNow they won't get anything - at least, not from Sondland directly. And while Democrats might cite the administration's obstinance as evidence of obstruction, their goal is a quick and thorough inquiry, not a drawn-out investigatory stalemate.\n\nText messages made public last week show Mr Sondland discussing with other US diplomats an effort to pressure Ukrainian leaders to investigate Mr Biden.\n\nIn one of the texts, Mr Sondland said Mr Trump \"really wants the deliverable\".\n\nIn another exchange, Bill Taylor, the senior US diplomat in Ukraine, questions whether conditions are being attached to US military aid and a White House invitation for Ukraine's president.\n\nMr Sondland replies that their discussion should be continued over the phone.\n\nImage caption Top US diplomats Bill Taylor and Gordon Sondland's text messages were released on Thursday\n\nAnother text shows Mr Taylor saying it would be \"crazy\" to withhold military aid to Ukraine for Mr Trump's political gain in the 2020 election.\n\nBut Mr Sondland firmly pushes back, saying Mr Taylor has misunderstood the president's intentions.\n\nMr Sondland was a Seattle-based hotelier who donated $1 million to the Republican president's inauguration committee before Mr Trump nominated him to his position as ambassador in May.\n\nHe had been due to give private testimony on Tuesday to the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight Committees.", "description": "Gordon Sondland was due to meet behind closed doors with three Democratic-led House committees.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/52D5/production/_109150212_hi057066186.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
