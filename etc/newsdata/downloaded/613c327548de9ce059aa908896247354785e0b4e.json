Combined with the Subika Underground, which was successfully completed in November 2018, the mill expansion is expected to increase Ahafo\u2019s average annual gold production to between 550,000 and 650,000 ounces per year through 2024, while lowering life-of-mine processing costs.\n\nNewmont Goldcorp\u2019s Ahafo Mill Expansion in Ghana Achieves Commercial Production\n\n\u201cThe Ahafo Mill Expansion represents our third profitable project delivered on schedule and within budget in 2019, along with the Tanami Power project in Australia and the Borden mine in Canada,\u201d said Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. \u201cThe mill expansion is expected to generate an internal rate of return of more than 20 percent at a $1,200 gold price, while also extending profitable production at Ahafo through at least 2029. I continue to be encouraged by Ahafo\u2019s and Ghana\u2019s mineral prospectivity and the potential for ongoing, profitable growth.\u201d\n\nFeatures and benefits of the mill expansion include:\n\nIncreasing mill capacity at Ahafo by more than 50 percent to nearly 10 million tonnes per year with the addition of a crusher, grinding mill and leach tanks to the circuit\n\nAdding annual gold production of 75,000 to 100,000 ounces per year for the first five full years beginning in 2020\n\nAccelerating efficient processing of ore from stockpiles and the Subika Underground mine, as well as harder, lower-grade ore from Ahafo\u2019s existing pits\n\nSupporting profitable development of Ahafo\u2019s highly prospective underground resources, which continue to demonstrate considerable upside\n\nAhafo is expected to deliver record production this year \u2013 with improved costs \u2013 driven by higher grades from the Subika open pit, a full year of mining from the Subika Underground and the completion of the Ahafo Mill Expansion. Commercial production began at Ahafo in 2006, and in 2018 the operation sold 436,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $864 per ounce.i\n\nNewmont Goldcorp has the strongest and most sustainable portfolio of operations, projects and exploration prospects in the gold sector. These assets allow the Company to sequence profitable projects in its unmatched pipeline to sustain six to seven million ounces of steady gold production over a decades-long time horizon.\n\nAbout Newmont Goldcorp\n\nNewmont Goldcorp is the world\u2019s leading gold company and a producer of copper, silver, zinc and lead.
