Under the agreement with the SEC, first disclosed as a settlement in principle by Mylan in July, the drugmaker will pay $30 million.\n\nThe SEC lawsuit details years of Mylan\u2019s efforts to fight allegations it overcharged taxpayers, and then negotiating with the government over a settlement. Neither the investigation nor the potential settlement was disclosed to investors while those events were ongoing. The company in October 2016 announced a settlement with the Justice Department for $465 million.\n\n\u201cInvestors were kept in the dark about Mylan\u2019s EpiPen misclassification and the potential loss Mylan faced as a result of the pending investigations,\u201d said Antonia Chion, associate director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement.\n\nMylan shares closed down 2.4% to $19.29 in New York.\n\nControversial Product\n\nThe SEC settlement is the latest black eye for a company that\u2019s no stranger to controversy. Mylan has been named in lawsuits by state attorneys general that accuse 20 drugmakers of conspiring to carve up the market and raise price on more than 100 generic drugs. Democratic members of Congress have said the company has stonewalled their inquiries into its conduct. And the company has struggled to resolve a more than a year old supply shortage of EpiPen, even as copycat competitors have come on the market.\n\nMylan has said that it acted properly and that its executives did not conspire to fix prices. It has also said that it is cooperating with investigations. EpiPen is manufactured by a Pfizer Inc. subsidiary and sold by Mylan, and the companies have said they are working on the supply issue. Pfizer and Mylan in July struck a deal to combine Mylan and Pfizer\u2019s older-drugs business.\n\nThe EpiPen settlement relates to a complex program in Medicaid, the federal-state health program for low-income people, that\u2019s meant to get the government deep discounts on drugs. Under the program, almost all drugs are subject rebates to the government. But generics, which are typically lower-priced and have slim margins, pay a much smaller rebate than brand-name products.\n\nEven though EpiPen faced little competition and the company had increased the price by hundreds of dollars, it had been classified as a generic product under the discount program. In 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told Mylan that EpiPen \u201chas an incorrect drug category\u201d in a government database, and that the company needed to verify and update the information.\n\n1997 Letter\n\nMylan\u2019s justification for calling EpiPen a generic product was a 1997 letter from the government. But inside the company, executives raised doubts about whether the letter was sufficient, according to the SEC.\n\nThe 1997 letter was \u201cbasically just done as a result of a conversation two guys who were there at the time had,\u201d one Mylan employee said in an internal email to a Mylan executive, according to the SEC lawsuit. If there had been a new review, \u201cthey would have been denied given today\u2019s market size and that ours was a loose interpretation to begin with,\u201d said the employee.\n\nIn November 2014, the SEC said, Mylan received the first Justice Department subpoena as part of a civil investigation into whether the company had misclassified the drug and cost taxpayers millions of dollars. At the time, about 20% of EpiPen\u2019s $1 billion in annual sales came from Medicaid, according to the SEC.\n\nFor the next year, Mylan argued that the government should drop its investigation. In response, the government sent more subpoenas, and had the company to sign an agreement extending the statute of limitations. In October 2015, however, Mylan began to share estimates of potential damages with the Justice Department, saying that in one quarter in 2015, calling EpiPen a generic had let the company avoid somewhere between $12 million and $42 million in rebates to Medicaid.\n\nIn 2014 and 2015, Mylan told investors in filings that it was discussing the matter with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. But the SEC said that the company misrepresented the government\u2019s position, downplaying its risk.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Mylan NV misled investors for at least a year about a Justice Department investigation into the allergy shot EpiPen that would eventually cost the company nearly $500 million, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Friday.The settlement appears to close one part of a long-running", "authors": ["Riley Griffin", "Matt Robinson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/M506Cbsoxa0DIAUpvieKgg--~B/aD0xMzMxO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/f64b7765d33559b5490d27a4024c8b9b", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
