Schiff\u2019s longstanding contention that there was \u201cample evidence of collusion in plain sight\u201d between the president or his political allies and a foreign government has now been more than borne out, albeit in a different scenario that Schiff could never have predicted.\n\nIf the conclusion of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election was murky\u2014with its finding of insufficient evidence that Trump\u2019s campaign directly coordinated with Russian officials to influence the outcome\u2014the latest revelations about Trump\u2019s communication with Ukraine are burdened by no such ambiguity.\n\n\u201cThere can be no claim of ignorance this time,\u201d Schiff told reporters this afternoon after his committee heard three hours of testimony from acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. That is, of course, because the White House\u2019s own summary of Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has Trump directly asking for the \u201cfavor\u201d of looking into Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings there, in implicit exchange for hundreds of millions of dollars in American military aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe anonymous whistle-blower\u2019s complaint alleges that the call was just one part of a long-running campaign by Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to prompt Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Earlier today, in a phone call with Atlantic White House reporter Elaina Plott, Giuliani said, \u201cIt is impossible that the whistle-blower is a hero and I\u2019m not. And I will be the hero! These morons\u2014when this is over, I will be the hero.\u201d\n\nWhile Schiff acknowledged that some aspects of the whistle-blower\u2019s accusations remain to be corroborated, he said, \u201cin a very substantial part this whistle-blower has already been found to be credible,\u201d by virtue of the White House\u2019s official record of the call.\n\nTrump promptly tweeted that \u201cAdam Schiff has zero credibility. Another fantasy to hurt the Republican Party.\u201d But Schiff, whose demeanor is as low-key and unruffled as his convictions are fierce, merely smiled at reporters outside the House hearing room and replied, \u201cI\u2019m always flattered when I\u2019m attacked by someone of the president\u2019s character.\u201d\n\n\n\nAll along, first as the committee\u2019s ranking member and then as chairman since the Democrats won control of the House in last year\u2019s midterm elections, Schiff\u2019s paramount goal has been simple, as he told me just before Mueller testified to his committee about his final special counsel\u2019s report in July.\n\n\u201cIt is our hope that we can inform the American people of the full facts, that they can appreciate the degree to which the Russians interfered in a presidential election to help Donald Trump, the degree to which the president welcomed that help, knew it was going on, welcomed it, and then lied about it and covered it up. And the degree to which those actions and his actions since continue to put us at risk, because it encourages the Russians to get involved again.\u201d\n\nThat Trump himself is now on record as asking for just such sort of help\u2014albeit from Russia\u2019s bitter adversary, Ukraine\u2014is a plot line almost too perfect to have been made up. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a more serious set of allegations than those contained in the complaint,\u201d Schiff told reporters after the hearing, noting that the president\u2019s actions involved numerous potential offenses, criminal or otherwise.\n\n\n\nSchiff noted a \u201cdeep irony\u201d in the contrast between Maguire\u2019s initial refusal to forward the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint to Congress, as generally required by law, on the grounds that it did not involve actions by the intelligence community, and the whistle-blower\u2019s accusation that the record of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky had been stored in a special White House computer system designed to protect the most sensitive intelligence secrets.\n\nHe vowed to continue the committee\u2019s investigation through the upcoming congressional recess, calling witnesses, including the whistle-blower, as needed. \u201cThere is a whole host of people, apparently, who have knowledge of these events,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthis whistle-blower has given us a roadmap for our investigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know what we have to do and, of course, we\u2019ll be guided by the evidence that we find along the way,\u201d he said.\n\nSchiff\u2019s longtime foil on the committee, Representative Devin Nunes of California, the ranking Republican member, was unmoved, insisting angrily near the end of the hearing, \u201cThe intelligence committee is not an appropriate place to try articles of impeachment.\u201d\n\nBut Schiff\u2019s own quiet summary at the hearing\u2019s conclusion was addressed directly to the people of Ukraine, and it was succinct. \u201cWhat you are seeing in the actions of this president is not democracy,\u201d he said, then adding of his own committee\u2019s sometimes fractious work: \u201cThis is democracy.\u201d", "description": "The House Intelligence Committee chairman has spent months illuminating Trump\u2019s alleged misdeeds with fruitless results.
