Steph's f***ed it #GBBO.\"\n\nA third remarked: \"Paul literally went innnnn on Steph! So nasty. No need. #GBBO #GBBOFinal.\"\n\nBut another commented: \"Paul comforting Steph is one of the sweetest things. I feel for her so much #gbbo #GBBOFinal.\"\n\nTonight, self-confessed \u201cunderdog\u201d David won Bake Off \u2013 despite not being named as Star Baker once during the series.\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nAfter lifting the trophy, David admitted it was a huge shock. \u201cHonestly it was never in my mind that I thought I could win this.\n\n\u201cIt feels so good! It\u2019s been weeks and weeks of intensity and fatigue and then to finish it with this - I saved the best til last, and it\u2019s the best feeling in the world. Week on week other people were stronger, I was always the underdog and yet I just managed to get through.\n\n\u201cAll of it is a bit surreal, and I am still trying to process it, but the whole Bake Off journey is non-stop and part of it is just having the stamina.\u201d\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
