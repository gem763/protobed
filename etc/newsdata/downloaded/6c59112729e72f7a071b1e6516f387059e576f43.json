Their argument is that super should not be compulsory for lower paid Australians, on say less than $50,000 per year.\n\nThese are the people who would have no super nest egg without a compulsory saving system. To remove compulsory super would be bad for them, it would be bad for the country and bad for the economy.\n\nMore than 4 million Australian workers will end up with less money at retirement, and we\u2019ll all end up paying more in tax to support even more people on the pension. Australia would create a large underclass of people outside the super system, and to assert that their lost super would be replaced by higher wages denies real world experience. As Bill Kelty has pointed out, there would have to be a legislated 9.5 per cent increase in wages to give it any chance of happening.\n\nBut even if a miracle occurred and super contributions were replaced by a wage rise, modelling by ex-Treasury officials for Industry Super Australia shows that for a 30 year old male worker earning $50,000 a year \u2013 let\u2019s call him John \u2013 opting out of super and choosing to take it as wages would not only see John miss out on more than half a million dollars in super by retirement, he would also pay more than $100,000 in additional income tax over his working life.\n\nFundamental part of social fabric\n\nJohn would then reach retirement age with close to nothing in his super account and would most likely be entirely dependent on the pension, while the extra tax John paid for the best part of 40 years meant he ended up keeping far less of his hard-earned wages than if he had kept receiving super contributions.\n\nThese numbers are pretty staggering. They highlight the folly of those that argue low income earners would be better off not saving for their retirement, and taking the money now.\n\nLow income earners, including mums taking time out of paid work to have a baby all deserve access to the clear benefits of having compulsory superannuation. Some of those who are claiming low income earners should be able to opt-out are basing it on the misguided belief that low-income earners will remain low income earners for their entire life. This is simply not true. Mums working part-time while they care for their kids are the perfect case in point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe success of our superannuation system is its universality. Compulsory superannuation is there to give everyone dignity in retirement \u2013 regardless of your background, or how much you earn. Like Medicare, it is a fundamental part of our social fabric.\n\nFor those Australians retiring now, with more than two decades of compulsory super payments, the money they have accrued in super makes all the difference. It means being able to take a holiday to visit the grandkids. It means being able to have the heater on in winter and not worry about whether the bill will get paid. It means greater dignity in retirement.\n\nThe Treasurer has said this should be a fact-based, evidence driven review. And he\u2019s right. To achieve that outcome we all need to have confidence that the review will be immune from the push to undermine the universality of compulsory super. Just as consideration of the family home has been ruled out of the scope of the review, so should this foundational element of our successful super system.", "description": "Swapping super for pay would charge low-paid workers more tax for a poorer retirement.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_31%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/68f999f13f4d894974752feadc54db53a64b565d", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
