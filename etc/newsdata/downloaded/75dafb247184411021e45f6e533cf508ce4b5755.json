She\u2019s also working on \"Other People's Houses,\" a dramedy set to air on Fox.\n\nWhile it\u2019s been a few years since Gellar left Sunnydale, she credits \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201d as being one of the biggest learning experiences of her career.\n\n\u201cIt would be hard to encompass in one sentence what \u201cBuffy\u201d taught me,\u201d Gellar told \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime gift as an actor, and realizing the importance that holds is still really overwhelming and very special.\u201d\n\nFrom her iconic roles in the \u201890s to tackling motherhood, Gellar got right to the point when it comes to advice she would give to her younger self.\n\nIn 1997, Gellar became \u201cthe chosen one\u201d when she was cast as Buffy Summers.\n\n\u201cWhen you have time and you understand the impact that that show had, your really appreciate the experience,\u201d Gellar told \u201cGMA.\u201d\n\nDuring its first season, Gellar had no idea that \u201cBuffy The Vampire Slayer\u201d would resonate with as many people as the show eventually did.\n\nWhen it comes to her role models, Buffy Summers is still a top pick for Gellar.\n\nHave the courage to fight your demons.\n\nGetty Images, FILE\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s such an incredible role model for anybody going through a true horror in life,\u201d Gellar said. \u201cShe fought her own demons and that\u2019s what we all have to do.\u201d\n\nBelieve in yourself.\n\n\u201cWhich one\u2019s me?!\u201d Gellar laughed as she looked at a family photo of her and her mom. \u201cThat picture, in particular, is extremely trippy.\u201d\n\nGellar doesn\u2019t just get her looks from her mother; she also inherited her strong sense of self.\n\n\u201cI would have to imagine that I\u2019m like my mom, considering the fact that she raised me by herself,\u201d said Gellar.\n\nGellar grew up in New York City and said she wouldn\u2019t trade her childhood filled with Broadway, museums and quality time with her mom for anything.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest piece of advice that my mom gave me was to believe in myself,\u201d said Gellar. \u201cBecause if you don\u2019t believe in yourself, no one else is going to take that chance.\u201d\n\nBe a true fighter.\n\nWhile the iconic kiss between Gellar and Selma Blair\u2019s characters in \"Cruel Intentions\" looked intimate, Gellar remembers it as anything but.\n\n\u201cWe shot, like, six days of 'Cruel Intentions' in New York City and it was the first nice day in the spring,\u201d Gellar recalled. \u201cPretty much every single New Yorker happened to have been in Central Park on that day that we were filming.\u201d\n\nSince their \u201cCruel Intentions\u201d days, Blair and Gellar are still besties. Gellar has been by her co-star\u2019s side throughout her battle with multiple sclerosis.\n\n\u201cI think in this last period what we\u2019ve realized is how strong and how tough and how badass she is,\u201d Gellar said. \u201cI\u2019m in awe of her every day.\"\n\nThere\u2019s no secret to a successful relationship.\n\nAnother relationship that\u2019s important to Gellar is the one she has with her husband, Freddie Prinze Jr.\n\nThe couple recently celebrated their 17th wedding anniversary. What is their secret to a successful marriage?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no secret to a successful relationship,\u201d said Gellar. \u201cIt\u2019s work and you have to be willing to put the work in any relationship that you have in your life.\u201d\n\nA smile lets people in\n\nCourtesy of Colgate Optic White Platinum High Impact Toothpaste\n\nWhen it comes to balancing family and work, Gellar credits sticking to a regular routine as part of her recipe for success.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t have time for products that don\u2019t work and the key for me is consistency,\u201d Gellar said. \u201cI have some products that I\u2019ve been using for years and one of them is my toothpaste -- Colgate Optic White Platinum High Impact. I\u2019ve been using it for years and it is whitening that works. I love it!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why Colgate was a natural partnership for Gellar. She recently teamed up with the brand since she is a longtime fan of how it has helped her maintain her pearly whites.\n\n\u201cEyes are the window to the soul but a smile lets people in,\u201d said Gellar. \u201cEverything is about a smile.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/TIFM_SarahMichelleGellar_v02_sd_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
