In the drawing, they perch on a crag, awaiting the end of a storm of protest.\n\nIt is captioned \u201cLet Us Prey.\u201d\n\nSaturday in Washington seemed to show not one sign of the devastating storm, Hurricane Dorian, that roared in the Atlantic Ocean for days.\n\nIt was a delightfully dry, sunny, 86-degree day with an average wind speed of less than 7 mph.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The mention of vultures in such a political city prompts thoughts of a well-known cartoon.", "authors": ["Martin Weil", "Local Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
