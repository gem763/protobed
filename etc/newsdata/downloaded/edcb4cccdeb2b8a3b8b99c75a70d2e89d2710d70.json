Ben Sasse speaks on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., September 27, 2018. (Andrew Harnik/Pool via Reuters)\n\nSenator Ben Sasse offered the strongest criticism yet from a Senate Republican of President Trump\u2019s suggestion that China investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden\u2019s son\u2019s business dealings.\n\n\u201cHold up: Americans don\u2019t look to Chinese commies for the truth. If the Biden kid broke laws by selling his name to Beijing, that\u2019s a matter for American courts, not communist tyrants running torture camps,\u201d the Nebraska Republican said in a statement to the Omaha World-Herald.\n\nSasse\u2019s condemnation came a day after Trump accused the former vice president\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, of engaging in \u201ccrooked\u201d business dealings with Ukraine and China.\n\nTrump accused the younger Biden of flying on Air Force Two in 2013 with his father, then the vice president, in order to obtain $1.5 billion from Chinese investors for his private equity fund.\n\n\u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens,\u201d the president told reporters Thursday outside the White House. \u201cHe got kicked out of the Navy. All of the sudden he\u2019s getting billions of dollars. You know what they call that? They call that a payoff.\u201d\n\nThe president added that \u201cif [Ukraine] were honest about it they\u2019d start a major investigation into the Bidens.\u201d\n\nSasse did not spare House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff in his remarks either, accusing the California Democrat of partisanship in the House\u2019s formal impeachment inquiry against the president.\n\n\u201cCongressman Schiff is running a partisan clown show in the House \u2014 that\u2019s his right because the Constitution doesn\u2019t prohibit clown shows, but fortunately, in the Senate, we\u2019re working to follow the facts one step at a time,\u201d Sasse said.\n\nSasse sits on the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee, which is working on its own investigation into the whistleblower complaint accusing Trump of a potential quid pro scheme with Ukraine involving the temporary withholding of U.S. military aid on the condition that Ukraine investigates the Bidens.\n\nAnother Republican senator, Ron Johnson, defended Trump\u2019s comments on China.\n\n\u201cFirst of all one of my comments would be as a member of the Democratic Party wouldn\u2019t you want to know if there\u2019s some real corruption before you choose Joe Biden,\u201d the Wisconsin senator said.", "description": "Senator Ben Sasse condemned President Trump's suggestion that China investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son's business dealings.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Andrew C.
