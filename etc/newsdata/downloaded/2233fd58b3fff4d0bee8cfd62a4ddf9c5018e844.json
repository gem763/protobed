The Massachusetts-based robotics company that makes the Roomba, among other autonomous cleaning devices, saw its stock plummet by nearly 20 percent today, after reporting third quarter earnings yesterday, as a result of lower sales in August and September. But its sales were only lower because it decided to increase prices in the US, an ill-fated move that\u2019s hurt the company domestically.\n\nThe culprit? President Trump\u2019s ongoing trade war with China, which iRobot\u2019s chairman and CEO, Colin Angle, cited directly as the cause. \u201cDespite the severity of US tariffs on robotic vacuum cleaners, and the direct and indirect disruptions they are having on US category growth, we remain committed to delivering exceptional value to consumers and are mobilizing accordingly,\u201d Angle said, according to a report from investment and finance blog The Motley Fool.\n\nThis has been coming for a while. In July, The Fool quoted Angle as saying that his company \u201cbelieve[s] that the direct and indirect impacts of the ongoing US-China trade war and the recently implemented 25 percent tariffs are likely to constrain US market segment growth in the second half of the year below our expectations at the start of 2019.\u201d Which is basically what happened. This past quarter, in the US, revenue declined 7 percent from this time a year ago. (International revenue, however, was up a full 25 percent.)\n\nPity the humble Roomba, a wholly blameless soul\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s tariffs were announced, iRobot decided to offset the costs of the tariffs on their products by briefly increasing the price of its products, which they quickly rolled back, because those price shifts hurt the number of units they sold. The company seems to be reevaluating its position, though, and Angle indicated the plan was to retrench and invest further in research and development to maintain their position as market leader.\n\nThat\u2019s interesting because it means that iRobot\u2019s market share has also been negatively impacted by the US-China tariffs. As the Fool reported, \u201cit seems clear that the company continues to believe now is a crucial time to prioritize maintaining market share via a combination of attractive pricing and heavy R&D investments.\u201d The point, in other words, is to solidify iRobot\u2019s dominance of the home robotics market.\n\nEconomics is an emotional science, with share prices largely determined by \u201cinvestor confidence\u201d (e.g., how they feel) and squishy guesses about what the market might look like in the future. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. But it does underscore the real impact that Trump\u2019s tariffs are having on the economy: they\u2019re making it materially harder for businesses to sell to consumers. Trade wars aren\u2019t easy to win, and they have a lot of victims. Pity the humble Roomba, a wholly blameless soul.\n\nAll this said: the 20 percent stock drop doesn\u2019t seem to have the Fool worried. \u201cIf the drop is still holding when my Motley Fool trade restrictions are satisfied, I fully intend to add to my position later this week,\u201d writes author Steve Symington.", "description": "iRobot finds itself in a bind.
