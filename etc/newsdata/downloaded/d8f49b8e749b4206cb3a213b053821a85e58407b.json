She was also personally wealthy, obscenely so. But the problem remains: Warren intends to make raising money from the elite an important part of her political project.\n\n\n\nWhat is the problem with raising money from millionaires and billionaires? First and most obviously, it matters because of the risk that candidates will change their policies in office in order to ensure future donations: If you piss off Jeff Millionaire too much, he won\u2019t donate to you. Similarly, if your proposed policies during the election are too much for Jeff, he won\u2019t write that check. Now, it seems very unlikely that many big donors would think Warren a good target for this sort of blatant quid pro quo; taxing the rich is sort of her whole thing. But big donors will still have an interest in making sure the Democratic Party continues to depend on their donations when it comes time to, say, work on reining in drug prices, or making housing more affordable. In this way, it\u2019s almost worse that she wants to help keep the DNC itself stocked with the kind of cash that impedes it from being a genuine advocate for the working class; her campaign has a much purer pedigree here than her party does.\n\n\n\nIf the country is to survive, the next Democratic president must remake the Democratic Party itself. The institutions and organizations of Democratic power in Washington are hopelessly awash in corrupt money, and more highly attuned to the concerns of the donors on whom they depend than ordinary voters. They\u2019re also more concerned about recruiting Democrats who can raise money from the rich than prospective office-holders who are uniquely committed to achieving a grand scale of change, and they work to shut out the candidates who won\u2019t play that game. And what we know about how the House Democratic caucus works plainly shows that their internal system of rewards and promotions are predicated on fundraising prowess rather than policymaking: members that reliably bring home the pelf get slated for plum committee assignments, where the larger party agendas are set. The structure seamlessly siphons donor money and influence right up the chain of command.\n\n\n\nWarren\u2019s decision to placate and enmesh herself in these institutions is an indication that she has less interest in revolutionizing the party than in working within its creaky machinery to attain power. But we knew this already: In August, The New York Times reported that Warren was quietly \u201csignaling to party leaders that, far from wanting to stage a \u2018political revolution\u2019 in the fashion of Mr. [Bernie] Sanders, she wants to revive the beleaguered Democratic National Committee and help recapture the Senate while retaining the House in 2020.\u201d In this context, \u201crevive\u201d means \u201craise lots of money for,\u201d which the article made clear: She told donors at a DNC event this summer that she had \u201craised or gave more than $11 million helping get Democrats elected up and down the ballot around the country\u201d and \u201csent contributions to all 50 state parties, the national committees and the redistricting fight.\u201d\n\n\n\nIf you want to know whether or not big donors shape our politics, you need only ask them.\n\nIf you want to know whether or not big donors shape our politics, you need only ask them. Rufus Gifford, who is apparently not a character in a British children\u2019s book about a teddy bear but a former Obama national finance chair, tweeted after Warren announced she wouldn\u2019t attend big donor fundraisers that her decision would \u201cbankrupt\u201d the Democratic Party. (Gifford has so far donated to two Democratic presidential candidates: He maxed out to Cory Booker and Joe Biden.) Gifford\u2019s service as donor-wrangler in the 2012 Obama campaign was followed up by a totally coincidental span as ambassador to Denmark. Isn\u2019t it nice when the perfect candidate for the Denmark ambassadorship just happens to have worked as your finance guy?\n\n", "description": "The Democratic frontrunner missed a chance to do something truly revolutionary.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/56e53015c3b961442281518fed43fae94dc992c3.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
