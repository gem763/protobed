Fingers crossed it doesn\u2019t affect anyone negatively.\"\n\n(Image: Dave Benett/Getty Images for The)\n\nWhen host Caroline Flack caught wind of Jameela's comments she fired back in defence of her new show.\n\nShe tweeted: \"As you know self image is a complicated, sensitive and personal subject.\n\n\"At the heart of this show are people not contestants who have sought help to want to better them selves in their own eyes. Their stories deserve to be told and not ridiculed online.\"\n\nWhen one of Caroline's followers questioned her about the premise of the show, she snapped back: \"You really need to watch it .. it\u2019s a discussion show.\"\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\nAnother follower questioned Jameela for targeting Caroline directly.\n\nTo which 'activist' Jamil replied: \"I didn\u2019t go for Caroline. I said the show sounded like black mirror, and Caroline came for me over it.\n\n\"I was not criticizing her. She didn\u2019t create the show. I hope it doesn\u2019t cause adverse effects on young people. Reality Tv is so insane these days. A jury judging bodies is wild.\"\n\nThe Good Place actress then added: \"Just wanna remind everyone that teenage cosmetic surgery numbers are the highest they\u2019ve ever been. Teenage suicide/self harm numbers are the highest they\u2019ve ever been.\n\n\"Teenage eating disorders are the highest they\u2019ve ever been. This is why I never shut up. Fix it and I\u2019ll chill.\"\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\nThe premise of new Channel 4 lifestyle show The Surjury is participants appealing to a jury about their desired cosmetic sugery.\n\nIf the contributors get 75 per cent of the vote they are given the green light to have the procedure and will be invited back on the show to unveil the results months later.\n\nThe show finished filming in Manchester and is expected to air in early 2020.\n\nCaroline defended the show again on Twitter by claiming: \"I've filmed it and the people who have taken part are amazing and have been through a lot and life is about individual choice.\"\n\nThe series will be produced by Gobstopper Television for Channel 4 and was commissioned by Becky Cadman, factual entertainment commissioning editor at Channel 4.\n\nCadman said: \"To many, cosmetic surgery can seem like a \u2018quick fix\u2019 to a problem.\n\n\"But with Caroline and the Jury\u2019s help, this new series looks at who wants it, and why \u2013 allowing those who make a strong enough case to their peers, to undergo the procedure of their choice.\n\n\"The show will neither glamorise nor condemn their choices: the aim is instead to interrogate the realities.\"", "description": "The Love Island presenter was announced as the new host of a Channel 4 show that sees people pitch their plastic surgery dreams", "authors": ["Lucy Needham", "Image", "Pa Wire Pa Images", "Wireimage", "Dave Benett Getty Images For The", "Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20700285.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MAIN-Caroline-Flack-Love-Island.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
