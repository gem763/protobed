We are witnessing, as if spectators, an attempted coup unfold in real time on the daily and nightly news. But make no mistake, the coup isn\u2019t actually about Democrats hating President Trump. Do they despise him, his demeanor, his success\u2014of course; however, the coup that\u2019s unfolding around us is driven by Democrats\u2019 deep seeded hatred for you and me\u2014the everyday, hardworking American.\n\nYou see, to Democrats, President Trump is the embodiment of middle America. Despite his wealth, fame, and celebrity, he represents the Iowa farmer, the Pennsylvania steel worker, the West Virginia coal worker, the Wisconsin teacher, and the Arizona small business owner. He\u2019s the conservative dad who comes home after an exhausting day of work and puts on Fox News. Donald J. Trump is the man who refuses to cower to media and east coast elites; instead taking them head on, never backing down and relishing every second of the fight. Trump is you.\n\nTo understand that impeachment isn\u2019t about Trump look no further than the Washington Post\u2019s Inauguration Day headline \u2018The Campaign To Impeach President Trump Has Begun.\u2019 Despite having won the 2016 in an electoral landslide, Democrats have plotted and schemed how they were going to take down Trump. Democrats have trotted out phony stories, fake news, fabricated evidence and a series of hoax scandals to no avail. Each attempt has fallen epically flat further destroying their credibility with the American people and fueling their descent into lunacy and desperation.\n\nConsider that since the Democrats\u2019 latest impeachment hoax President Trump\u2019s approval rating amongst Republicans has swelled to a staggering 95% and hauled in over $125 million in third quarter fundraising\u2014dwarfing even the best fundraising quarter this year amongst Democrat presidential hopefuls. Equally as impressive, Trump continues to fill larger and larger stadiums and attract a more diverse coalition of support from key voter cohorts that Democrats can\u2019t afford to lose.\n\nUnsurprisingly, instead of seeing the President\u2019s support and fundraising prowess as a sign that they\u2019ve mistargeted their political calculus, Democrats have doubled down their attacks and increased the fever pitch of their media hyperbole. I say unsurprisingly because they have to; they have no choice.\n\nTrump\u2019s plainspoken appeal to main street Americans is unrivaled by anyone on the left. It\u2019s clear to any objective observer that Trump resonates with regular Americans because he is one. Democrats on the other hand have trotted what is effectively a clown car of candidates. From \u2018Quid Pro Joe\u2019 Biden who appears to have leveraged his political influence as Vice President; to enrich his family to the Elizabeth \u2018Fauxahontas\u2019 Warren who lied for years about being Native American so she could exploit affirmative action to land a nearly half million dollar a year ivy league professorship; to Kamala Harris who used her elitist liberal privilege to sleep her way to the top of California Democratic politics. Every semi-sane Democratic candidate that dared to hold their own party accountable on the issues actual Americans care about like transportation infrastructure, jobs, illegal immigration, border security, national security, etc. were institutionally shut down and shut out of the primary process. The Democrats have exorcised any notion of putting Americans, or what the issues they care most about, from their Party\u2019s belief system and candidate litmus tests.\n\nDemocrats at-large have ripped off the masks that they begrudgingly wore for the past half century to expose the extremism, hatred and anti-Americanism that exists at the core of their ideology. More importantly, Democrats have realized that the only way they can maintain their chokehold on power is to destroy the American system of government as it currently stands and replace it with a system without the same Constitutional protections for free will and freedom in general.\n\nIf we allow Democrats like Adam Schiff, Jerry Nadler, Nancy Pelosi and the bunch to undermine the foundational principles of American governance we are not simply risking the loss of one of the most effective policy presidents in American history, we are risking our entire concept of freedom and way of life.\n\nAt the end of the day, it is imperative that we recognize the motivations of our enemy. Sure Democrats hate President Trump, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s driving them. What\u2019s fueling them is their hatred for your freedom, your faith, your guns, your prosperity, your family, your property, and at its most core level, their hatred for you.\n\nDemocrats aren\u2019t after Trump, they\u2019re after you. He\u2019s just standing in their way.\n\nJake Hoffman is a contributing columnist at Townhall and the founder, president and CEO of Rally Forge, one of the nation\u2019s top conservative digital communications and media strategy firms.
