The first was supposed to lead to a decade or more of rapid economic growth, while the second was supposed to revive U.S. manufacturing.\n\nIn reality, however, the tax cut delivered at most a couple of quarters of higher growth. More specifically, huge tax breaks for corporations haven\u2019t delivered the promised surge in wages and business investment; instead, corporations used the windfall to buy back stocks and pay higher dividends.\n\nAt the same time, the trade war has turned out to be a major drag on the economy \u2014 bigger than many people, myself included, expected. Until last fall the general expectation was that Trump would deal with China the way he dealt with Mexico: make a few mainly cosmetic changes to existing arrangements, claim victory, and move on. Once it became clear that he was really serious about confrontation, however, business confidence began falling, dragging investment down with it.\n\nAnd voters have noticed: Trump\u2019s approval rating on the economy, while still higher than his overall approval, has started to decline. Hence the panicky demands that the Fed pull out all the stops.\n\nBut while Trump realizes that he\u2019s in trouble, there\u2019s no indication that he understands why. He\u2019s not the kind of person who ever admits, even to himself, that he made mistakes; his instinct is always to blame someone else while doubling down on his failed policies.\n\nEven actions that look like a slight policy softening, like his announcement of a two-week delay in implementing some China tariffs, betray a deep incomprehension of the problem \u2014 which has as much to do with his capriciousness as with the tariffs per se. Policy zigzags, even if they involve delaying tariffs, just add to the will-he-or-won\u2019t-he uncertainty that\u2019s causing companies to put investment on hold.\n\nSo what happens next? Trump could reverse course, and do what most people expected a year ago, reaching a deal with China that more or less restores the status quo. But that would be a de facto admission of defeat \u2014 and at this point it\u2019s not clear why the Chinese would trust him to honor any such deal past Election Day. The fact is that when it comes to economic policy, Trump has trapped himself in a bad place.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
