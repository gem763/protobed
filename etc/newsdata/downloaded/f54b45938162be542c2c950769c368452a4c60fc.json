Rugby World Cup team of round two 1/15 1, Ellis Genge (England) The loosehead prop may have only come on for England at half-time, but there had not been a run at the World Cup from a prop quite like what Genge produced against the USA. A barn-storming run saw him outpace one defender and trample over another, breaking the best part of 50 metres before it took two men to stop him. He was also excellent in the scrum to win countless penalties as the USA wilted. AP 2/15 2. Julian Montoya (Argentina) It takes something special to shine in Agustin Creevy\u2019s absence, but Montoya delivered with an excellent hat-trick to help lead Argentina to victory over Tonga. Montoya was smart to stay wide following a lineout for his first try, was the beneficiary of the rolling maul for the second and powered his way over from close range for a classy 26-minute hat-trick. AP 3/15 3. Levan Chilachava (Georgia) It\u2019s not often a Georgian makes the team of the round, but Chilachava lead an inspired Georgian pack to dominate Uruguay in their Sunday clash, scoring a try in the bonus-point victory and monstering the opposition front row in the scrum.

He may not have got on the scoresheet, but his impact in destroying Namibia\u2019s gameplan was standout nonetheless. AP 6/15 6.

Lewis Ludlam (England) A remarkable rise to prominence saw Ludlam score his first World Cup try for England in the demolition of the USA, but it was his all-round performance last week that earns him his place in the side.

Gareth Davies (Wales) Australia could not keep Davies out of the game in Tokyo, with the scrum-half twice intercepting Will Genia and Bernard Foley and nearly bagging himself a third in the second half.

Berchesi had to make do with a team on the back foot more often than not, yet managed to release his outside backs to run Fiji ragged. AFP/Getty Images 11/15 11. Makazole Mapimpi (South Africa) Mapimpi emerged from the shadow of Cheslin Kolbe to star in South Africa\u2019s rout of Namibia, scoring two tries to trigger the landslide victory.

AP\n\nThe late-night incidents are alleged to have happened the day before South Africa\u2019s World Cup squad was announced.\n\nEtzebeth was reportedly out at a bar with friends and family members when the incidents are alleged to have taken place.\n\nEtzebeth said in a statement after the allegations surfaced that it was \u201ccompletely untrue and unfounded to claim that I physically or racially abused anyone ... multiple witnesses can corroborate that.\u201d\n\nSA Rugby promised to cooperate with authorities and said it would take a hard-line approach if Etzebeth was found to be guilty. But it also backed Etzebeth after his denials, saying we \u201ctrust our people to act responsibly.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Springboks coach Rassie Erasmus said he met with Etzebeth and believed his story, and Etzebeth was included in the World Cup squad.\n\n\u201cI was definitely worried about it when I first heard about it,\u201d Erasmus said. \u201cIf there was any truth to it that would have been a massive issue for us. But after chatting to Eben and hearing his side of the story, there is trust between a coach and player.\n\n\u201cI have to trust him to do some stuff on the field and win test matches and he must trust me to believe him when he tells me something.\u201d\n\nEtzebeth also met with the human rights commission, the HRC, before flying to Japan with the Springboks squad. The allegations are also being investigated by criminal prosecutors.\n\n\u201cAs good and law-abiding corporate citizens, SA Rugby have given our full co-operation in the Eben Etzebeth investigation and will continue to do so,\u201d SA Rugby said last month. \u201cThe case is in the hands of (prosecutors) and the HRC. We trust and believe they will investigate it thoroughly. Once their findings are known, we will adhere to whatever is decided.\u201d\n\nThe human rights commission and equality courts were set up in the wake of South Africa\u2019s apartheid past and deal with cases of racial and also other discrimination. The courts generally operate like civil courts. The unnamed person accusing Etzebeth made a complaint to the human rights commission, the commission said.\n\nThe 27-year-old Etzebeth has played 81 tests and is one of the most experienced players in the Springboks squad. He\u2019s played a part in both South Africa\u2019s games at the World Cup so far, starting in the loss to defending champion New Zealand and coming off the bench in a big win against Namibia on Saturday.\n\nHe was named to start the game against Italy on Friday, when South Africa effectively needs to win to stay in contention at the World Cup.\n\nAP", "description": "Springboks lock Eben Etzebeth could be forced to return home midway through the Rugby World Cup in Japan after the South African Human Rights Commission said it was taking him to court over a case of alleged physical and racial abuse.
