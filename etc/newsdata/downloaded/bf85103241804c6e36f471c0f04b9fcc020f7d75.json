In addition to demanding that Dlamini \"correct her falsehood\", he said there was a link between her comments and a raid on the offices of subsidiaries of the Sekunjalo group on Wednesday last week.\n\nSekunjalo Investment Holdings added on Wednesday that it had written to the PIC, giving the asset manager until noon on Thursday to \"clarify their statement\". \"Failure to do so will see Sekunjalo exercise its right to not only institute a damages claim against the PIC but also against Ms Dlamini in her personal capacity,\" it said.\n\n\"[Tuesday's] comments and last week\u2019s FSCA raid are not unrelated, they have been purposefully designed to cause maximum harm to Sekunjalo and myself,\" he said.\n\n'Opportunistic, deceitful'\n\nThe PIC, in response, on Wednesday said Surv\u00e9's claims of a link between the PIC and the raid were \"misplaced, opportunistic, flawed and deceitful\".\n\n\"The correct position is that the PIC is not a party to any regulatory investigation by the FSCA into Dr Surv\u00e9 or his business entities that led to last week's search and seizure operation by the FSCA. An attempt to link the PIC\u2019s response and anticipated actions in respect of its investment in Sekunjalo and AYO to last week\u2019s raid at Sekunjalo\u2019s Offices is factually misplaced, opportunistic, flawed and deceitful,\" said the PIC.\n\nWhile the Financial Sector Conduct Authority, which carried out the raid, has not confirmed which company it was targeting, Surv\u00e9 previously said it was related to AYO Technology Solutions, an IT company in the Sekunjalo group that listed on the JSE in late 2017 after receiving R4.3bn in investment from the PIC.\n\nThe FSCA has previously said it was probing AYO in a market abuse investigation.\n\nThe PIC, meanwhile, has instituted a court case against AYO to compel it to return the full investment plus interest. AYO, whose share price has fallen 80% since listing, is opposing the matter. The case has not yet commenced.\n\nWhich Sekunjalo is it?\n\nThe PIC did not clarify on Wednesday whether Dlamini was referring to Sekunjalo Independent Media or Sekunjalo Investment Holdings when she referenced the possible liquidation application.\n\nThe state-run asset manager did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nIt has, however, said it will not to make further public statements until \"any anticipated and real legal proceedings \u2013 of whatever form or manner they may take - are instituted before court\".\n\nSurv\u00e9, meanwhile, has said Sekunjalo would be suing the FSCA because of the raid.", "description": "The head of Sekunajlo has said a link between comments made by PIC leadership in Parliament on Tuesday and a raid on the his offices offices by the market regulator last week.", "authors": ["Jan Cronje"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2449/13948c1cfc704c37a14d6fe0c8a2363f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
