In the early '80s, Moore co-founded the band Sonic Youth, which had one foot in punk rock and the other in experimental music. The band ended up playing stadiums and helped define a certain '90s hipster aesthetic.\n\nSince breaking up with his wife and bandmate Kim Gordon in the mid-2000s, Moore has mostly done solo work. He's just released a new box set called Spirit Counsel. The collection of long instrumental pieces draws on inspiration from the likes of Alice Coltrane and his early musical mentor, Glenn Branca.\n\nMoore joined q's Tom Power from London, England to tell us more about Spirit Counsel, which is out now.\n\nDownload our podcast or click the 'Listen' link above to hear the full conversation with Thurston Moore.\n\n\u2014 Produced by \u200bChris Trowbridge", "description": "Sonic Youth co-founder Thurston Moore tells us about the musical influences behind his new box set, Spirit Counsel \u2014 a collection of long instrumental pieces.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5321562.1571163387!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/thurston-moore.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
