Xhaka subbed for another poor performance - so responds by telling Arsenal fans to \u2018f*ck off\u2019, ripping his shirt off & storming down the tunnel.\n\nAnd this is supposed to be our CAPTAIN?\n\nWhat an absolute disgrace.\n\nHe should be stripped of the captaincy tonight. #afcpic.twitter.com/iCGxOl9scv \u2014 Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) October 27, 2019\n\nThat's bad from Xhaka but awful game management from the manager who made him the lightning rod as captain.\n\n\n\nIt's also bad because Xhaka turning against the fans has an impact in the dressing room. He's popular there.\n\n\n\nWhat a mess. \u2014 The Beautiful Groan (@beautifulgroan) October 27, 2019\n\nXhaka off for the second Premier League game in a row - big cheers greet the decision as Saka comes on.\n\n\n\nFans giving Xhaka the hurry up - he waves his arms, cups his ears and mouths \"fuck off\" twice.

He is seen as being part of an Arsenal team lacking backbone, as exposed by allowing their two-goal lead to slip against Palace on Sunday.\n\nThe Gunners lie fifth in the league, four points behind fourth-placed Chelsea, but with increasing doubts that Emery and his players can reverse the stagnation that set in during the latter years of the reign of Arsene Wenger.", "description": "Arsenal fans and club captain Granit Xhaka engaged in all-out animosity with each other during the Premier League clash against Crystal Palace as Xhaka appared to tell supports to \"f*ck off\" before ripping off his shirt.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5db5e4ae20302752f466e697.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
