But one thing it still can\u2019t do natively is track your sleep. Right now, if you want to track your sleep, you\u2019ll have to download a third-party app. That might change soon, though, as an App Store listing for Apple\u2019s Alarms app for Apple Watch references an unreleased Sleep app:\n\nBased on the short description in the screenshot, it sounds as if you\u2019ll be able to set your bedtime and wake-up time in the Sleep app, similar to how you can currently set those times in the iPhone\u2019s Clock app. It seems likely that the Sleep app would take this a step further, though, presumably by tracking your sleep patterns to gently wake you up at the most optimal time before your designated alarm, like other apps do.\n\nFor years, it\u2019s been rumored that Apple is adding sleep tracking to the Apple Watch, and in 2017, Apple signaled an increased interest in it by acquiring sleep-tracking hardware maker Beddit. Apple has treated Beddit similar to Beats, though, keeping the brand name alive since the acquisition. Beddit even released a new sleep tracker in December 2018.\n\nIn early September, we got a hint that sleep tracking might finally show up on the Apple Watch soon, based on \u201csources inside Apple\u201d who spoke with 9to5Mac. The feature, apparently called \u201cTime in Bed tracking,\u201d may track your quality of sleep based on information picked up by the Apple Watch\u2019s many sensors. The feature didn\u2019t materialize at Apple\u2019s September 2019 event, but perhaps, given the mention of a \u201cSleep\u201d app in an official Apple screenshot, we might see it in a watchOS update sometime soon.", "description": "Since the Apple Watch first came out, Apple has positioned it as a health and fitness tracker, but one thing it still can\u2019t do natively is track your sleep.
