That's the kind that gunks up your arteries and increases your risk of congestive heart failure and heart attack, among other bad situations. Lowered LDL is a good outcome for many people. But statins aren't a good way to get it. When the warnings on the label include \"a heightened risk of type 2 diabetes and elevated blood sugar levels,\" you're looking at a claim to infamy, not fame. That's deadly serious stuff. Nevertheless, millions of people remain on statins. Even though they are also linked to:\n\nTripled risk of artery calcification, making heart disease more dangerous, not less\n\nDepletion of essential nutrients, including vital coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)\n\nErectile dysfunction\n\nMuscle pain that can become lethal\n\nLiver dysfunction and acute kidney failure\n\nCataracts\n\nSerious memory problems, including a condition that can eliminate nearly all memory for days\n\nEssential fatty acids to the rescue\n\nCoronary heart disease\n\nHigh cholesterol\n\nCancer\n\nDepression\n\nAttention-deficit hyperactivity disorder\n\nElevated triglycerides\n\nHeart attack, abnormal heartbeat, and stroke\n\nHardening of the arteries\n\nHigh blood pressure\n\nIf you're still on statins, you must pay attention.\n\nDon't try to say eicosapentaenoic acid. Say \"EPA.\" EPA and DHA, the two most common omega-3 essential fatty acids (EFAs), are the go-to best health protectors of all. They're called \"essential\" for good reasons. Pick a problem:EPA and DHA, working together, can help prevent them, reduce their severity, or even reverse some of them. \"On statins\" belongs on the list of problems above.A recent study of coronary heart disease (CHD) patients on high-dose statin therapy found that adding EPA to their regimen \"significantly reduced\" the amount of coronary plaque in their cardiovascular systems, a major advance in reducing the risk of future CHD incidents. That's wonderful, but it doesn't get statins off the hook. You need some additional tactics that make your statins less threatening.\n\nWhy should you take CoQ10?\n\nAn ancient natural protector more potent than vitamin E\n\nStatins inhibit production of both LDL cholesterol and coenzyme CoQ10 in your liver. Lower LDL? OK, but with serious caveats. Lower CoQ10? A recipe for disaster. Congestive heart failure (CHF) is caused by anything that weakens the heart or makes it harder to do its job. So hardened or plaque-clogged arteries, or a previous heart attack, or high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid or kidney disease all can lead to CHF. CoQ10 is produced by, required by, and used by every cell in our bodies. It's ubiquitous\u2014hence its trade name, \u201cubiquinone.\u201d Its primary role: instruct our mitochondria to convert nutrients into the fuel that powers everything we do. Add to this that CoQ10 is also a powerful antioxidant. When it goes down, so does much of your immune system. What? From my point of view, if a doctor doesn't insist that their statin patients take supplemental CoQ10\u2014it's sheer foolishness. I tell my statin patients to take at least 200 mg of CoQ10 supplements daily, 100 mg in the morning, 100 mg at night. Importantly, CoQ10 can be taken in addition to most cardiovascular medications.Why do we keep inventing unnatural chemical stews when nature gives us a buffet banquet of health-keepers? For example, an antioxidant blast from the past\u2014silymarin, from the milk thistle plant. Recommended by genius Greek physician Pliny for \"carrying off bile,\" silymarin is a mega-antioxidant, said to be at least\n\nRegenerates liver cells damaged by alcohol or drugs, e.g., statins\n\nDecongests the liver by stimulating bile flow, reducing stagnation, and preventing gallstone and bile-induced liver damage\n\nAnd finally, go fish\n\nReferences\n\nSohet, Florence M., Audrey M.
