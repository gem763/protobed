REUTERS/Edgar Su/File Photo\n\nAnnounced at the Tokyo Motor Show this week, the new Lexus shows how Toyota is putting its research on self-driving technology to work in cars that have limited automation.\n\nThat strategy comes as more automakers - and even governments - are taking a longer view toward artificial intelligence (AI) and self-driving cars, paring back development targets after fatal accidents in Tesla Inc cars have shown the complexity of the technology.\n\nRight now, component manufacturers and venture companies working on the technology \u201care revising their timeline for AI deployment significantly,\u201d Executive Vice President Shigeki Tomoyama told a small group of reporters this week.\n\nWhile Toyota is using the motor show to tout its push to become a \u201cfuture mobility company\u201d showcasing futuristic, AI-based driving companions and miniature delivery robots, on the sidelines, Tomoyama injected a dose of reality about the pace of developing future cars.\n\n\u201cRight from the get-go, we figured it\u2019s going to be a time-consuming endeavor,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no particular need to rethink the time frame for our AI self-drive technology investment and development.\u201d\n\nToyota next year will release its first so-called \u201cLevel 2\u201d autonomous car, capable of driving itself on the highway, \u201cfrom entrance to exit, with traffic merging capability,\u201d Tomoyama said.\n\nOther automakers already market \u201cLevel 2\u201d cars, but a growing number are pushing out their schedules to develop future autonomous technologies, citing the high hurdle to clear before enabling cars to perform more driving tasks.\n\nNissan Motor Co also has abandoned an earlier in-house target to develop cars which can drive themselves on city streets by 2020. At the moment, its cars are able to drive on highways and park autonomously.\n\nTo develop the more advanced \u201cLevel 3\u201d hands-free automated driving technology, Nissan will need at least until the late 2020s, Tetsuro Ueda, an expert at Nissan\u2019s mobility service research center, told reporters this month.\n\n\u2018HUGE COMPLEXITIES\u2019\n\nGerman automaker Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) is also grappling with the size of the challenge.\n\n\u201cWe really thought at the beginning, it would be just maybe next year or so,\u201d said Aria Etemad, a project manager at Volkswagen Group Research. \u201cBut as we dig into that topic, we see huge complexities that we are facing.\u201d\n\nTesla is a notable exception to the cautious view. Chief Executive Elon Musk told investors on Wednesday that Tesla could release software to enable \u201cfully functional full self-driving\u201d capability by the end of this year.\n\nHowever, Musk qualified that by saying cars would still need to be \u201csupervised\u201d by a human driver. By the end of next year, Musk said Tesla hopes to release autonomous driving software \u201creliable enough that you do not need to pay attention\u201d. But he added \u201cacceptance by regulatory authorities will vary by jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just car manufacturers that are tempering expectations. Singapore, a pioneer for practical testing of autonomous vehicles, has struck a more cautious tone.\n\n\u201cWe are not in a rush to be the first adopter,\u201d Khaw Boon Wan, the transport minister, said this week. \u201cI look forward to a larger-scale adoption of AV (Autonomous Vehicle) technology in Singapore, but I think this will not be in the near future.\u201d\n\nThe comments surprised industry experts who view Singapore as the ideal test bed for driverless vehicles given its wealth, small size and top-notch infrastructure. The city state has even created a test zone for driverless vehicles with traffic lights, bus stops and a rain simulator.\n\n\u201cIf Singapore is saying this, then maybe other governments will follow suit,\u201d said Hussein Dia, professor of future urban mobility at Swinburne University in Melbourne, Australia.\n\n\u201cWhatever comes out of Singapore, the world watches and listens,\u201d he added, referring to its driverless expertise.\n\nMOTION TESTING\n\nGeneral Motors Co\u2019s self-driving unit, Cruise, said earlier this year it was delaying the commercial deployment of cars past its target of 2019 as more testing of the vehicles was required.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The interior of Toyota's electric LQ Concept car is pictured at the Tokyo Motor Show, in Tokyo, Japan October 24, 2019. REUTERS/Edgar Su -/File Photo\n\nIn GM\u2019s case, unexpected technical challenges, including the difficulty for cars to identify whether objects are in motion, are requiring the company to take more time and caution to develop its technology, sources have told Reuters.\n\nThe Japanese components maker Denso, Toyota\u2019s biggest supplier, believes it will take years for the technology for fully self-driving cars to hit the roads. For now it is working toward developing cars that can accelerate and brake on their own with driver monitoring.\n\n\u201cThe most difficult aspect of developing these driving systems is to anticipate unexpected movements in the vehicle\u2019s surroundings,\u201d said Hajime Kumabe, the head of Denso\u2019s engineering R&D center in Tokyo.", "description": "When Toyota Motor Corp launches its all-battery Lexus next year, the luxury model will be able to drive autonomously on highways, a big step for the Japanese automaker, which has so far trailed rivals in bringing self-driving cars to market.", "authors": ["Norihiko Shirouzu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444909411&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O1CB", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
