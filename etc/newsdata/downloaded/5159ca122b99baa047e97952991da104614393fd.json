A group of strippers approach, sliding seductively into their laps.\n\n\u201cWhat brings you guys out tonight?\u201d one stripper asks.\n\n\u201cOh, just looking to get out,\u201d one of the guys answers.

Like other cities across America, Reno is trying to remake its economy by luring high-tech companies to town. Unlike other American cities, however, some believe Reno\u2019s down-and-out image is getting in the way.\n\nIn partnership with the Reno Gazette Journal, USA TODAY has spent the past 18 months documenting this fight over Reno\u2019s strip clubs as a city that has thrived on vice tries to reinvent itself as a big-tech mecca.\n\nThe battle for the future of Reno plays out over six episodes in Season 2 of USA TODAY\u2019s critically acclaimed podcast The City. Episodes 1 and 2 are out today. New chapters will be released every Tuesday until Nov. 26. The series exposes the motivations of those involved in the fight, pulls back the curtains at the strip clubs and lays bare the true consequences of luring tech giants to town.\n\nIt\u2019s a fight being waged by powerful people. But as with many gentrification battles, some ordinary workers and the city\u2019s more vulnerable residents are suffering the most \u2013 like the strippers targeted in the undercover police sting, the low-income motel tenants whose homes are threatened by the strip club displacement, and the Tesla factory workers trying to make a go of it in the New Reno economy.\n\nDancers mingle with the customers of the Wild Orchid Gentlemen's Club in Reno, Nevada, which has been under fire from the city. Andy Barron, Reno Gazette Journal\n\nA Reno story\n\nReno, a city of 250,000 tucked into the eastern edge of the Sierra Nevada mountains, has long been famous for vice \u2013 from quickie divorces in the early 1900s to legalized gambling in the 1930s and the spread of strip clubs in the 1990s.\n\nWhen Las Vegas eclipsed Reno as America\u2019s favorite party town, Reno\u2019s fortunes began to fade, along with its image. To the uninitiated, Reno today is a tired casino town, the butt of jokes told by late-night comedians and schlocky TV shows.\n\nThe City podcast is back for Season 2 Hannah Gaber, USA TODAY\n\nTo city officials, becoming an offshoot of Silicon Valley is the answer.\n\n\u201cWe are truly experiencing a Reno revival,\u201d Reno Mayor Hillary Schieve said last year during her re-election campaign. \u201cWe are truly rebranding this city, and companies like Tesla, Amazon and Apple are all building and investing right here.\u201d\n\nTesla has built a giant battery factory on the outskirts of town. Apple\u2019s massive data farm is growing. Google is building just east of Reno, and Amazon has long had a distribution center in the area.\n\nThe Tesla Gigafactory, seen in the distance, currently employs more than 7,000 people and is the centerpiece of the New Reno economy. Hannah Gaber, USA TODAY\n\nReno\u2019s wooing of these tech giants has jump-started the gentrification of its urban core. As the city\u2019s power brokers try to ride the wave of this revival, they see Reno\u2019s strip clubs as stubborn and unnecessary obstacles.\n\nThe power brokers in Reno\n\nWith developers circling and the Reno City Council looking to revitalize downtown, a loose coalition of power brokers and activists formed to pressure the council to take on the strip clubs.\n\nThe coalition includes people with a financial stake in seeing the city\u2019s most prominent strip club, the Wild Orchid, kicked out of its quickly gentrifying neighborhood.\n\n\u201cThey have a gold mine there,\u201d said Par Tolles, a local developer who has invested heavily in the neighborhood surrounding the Wild Orchid. \u201cWe\u2019ve all tried to buy it. We\u2019ve all made offers. And they could redevelop that into a really, really interesting boutique hotel or apartment (building). It doesn\u2019t have to be what it is.\u201d\n\nOthers want it gone simply because they believe it contributes to Reno\u2019s smutty reputation.\n\nMike Kazmierski, head of the region\u2019s economic development agency, is a straight-laced former military commander from Colorado Springs, Colorado, who almost turned down the Reno job because of the city\u2019s seedy image.\n\nNow he\u2019s on a mission to put an end to that image, one strip club at a time.\n\n\u201cThey should not be defining us,\u201d he said.\n\nThe strip club kingpin\n\nThe focus of their fight is Reno\u2019s strip club kingpin: Kamy Keshmiri.\n\nKeshmiri, born and raised in Reno by Iranian immigrant parents, built an empire in Reno\u2019s vice-driven economy starting in the 1990s. He was a record-breaking discus thrower and hometown hero. At age 50, he still has 21-inch biceps \u2013 and a shock of black hair he wears in a manic mohawk.\n\nToday, he and his family own three of the city\u2019s four strip clubs.\n\nKeshmiri sees the campaign against his clubs as an affront to his status as a revered athlete and successful local businessman. He has found himself fending off rumors that his clubs were dens of drugs and prostitution while deflecting what he considers lowball offers from developers trying to scoop up his property.\n\n\u201cIt makes me angry,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a Hall of Fame athlete. I went to school here. I\u2019m a three-time NCAA champion. I\u2019m No. 1 in the world in my sport. I\u2019ve always been pro-Reno. I\u2019ve grown up in this town. And for them to do this to me, it makes me bitter.\u201d\n\nKeshmiri isn\u2019t about to let the city take his clubs. He plans to keep fighting back.\n\n\u201cI handle things in a different way,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll just be patient. There\u2019ll be a time when I get my revenge.\u201d\n\nShow caption Hide caption Wild Orchid co-owner Kamy Keshmiri, right, talks with his lawyer Mark Thierman inside the Wild Orchid strip club.

The men went to war against the city when it tried to kick strip clubs out of downtown. Andy Barron, USA TODAY Network\n\nThe vulnerable\n\nIn addition to strip clubs, Keshmiri owns the Ponderosa Hotel, a dilapidated motel attached to the Wild Orchid. He rents out rooms on a weekly and monthly basis to some of the city\u2019s most vulnerable residents.\n\nAs the city closes in on his strip clubs, Keshmiri draws those tenants into the fight by threatening to double their rent if the city succeeds in closing his clubs.\n\nThat terrified people like Velma Shoals, a 64-year-old grandmother raising a teenager at the Ponderosa. She lives on a meager disability check each month and can barely afford the Ponderosa\u2019s $750-a-month rent, not to mention the city\u2019s $1,300 median.\n\nVelma Shoals lives in the Ponderosa Hotel with her granddaughter. Shoals is one of thousands of motel residents in Reno who can\u2019t afford the area\u2019s skyrocketing housing prices. Hannah Gaber, USA TODAY\n\n\u201cThirteen hundred dollars?\u201d Shoals said. \u201cWho\u2019s got that kind of money? Nobody.\u201d\n\nA housing crunch sparked by the big-tech rush has gripped the entire city, forcing Tesla workers to live in RVs on city streets, flooding Reno\u2019s only homeless shelter and putting homeownership out of reach for many.\n\nThe fight\n\nAmid this rapid evolution, the power brokers and the strip club owners have gone head to head to persuade Reno\u2019s political elites to see things their way.\n\nThe Reno City Council engaged in the fight, taking up a number of measures that could ultimately oust the clubs from downtown \u2013 or make doing business there very difficult for the club owners.\n\nTo find out what happens, subscribe to The City for free on Apple Podcasts or wherever you listen.
