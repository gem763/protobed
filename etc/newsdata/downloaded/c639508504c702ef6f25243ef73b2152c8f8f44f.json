The country aims to land the explorer on the Red Planet in two years, according to a scientist\n\nA picture of the explorer, called 'Mars 1', was published today by the state-owned China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC), Beijing's main space manufacturer.\n\nThe craft is seen partially covered by golden sheets while a banner at the front suggests the craft was undergoing its last tests. Four workers are seen working around the explorer.\n\nThe image was then taken down by CASIC from Twitter-like Weibo, but it has been shared by multiple state-run news outlets, including China Central Television Station and Global Times.\n\nYe Jianpei, China's chief scientist for deep-space exploration programmes, said the team expected the probe to land on Mars by the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party, which will fall on July 1, 2021.\n\nChina has built a mock Mars base-camp in the Gobi Desert to mimic the landscape and living conditions on the Red Planet. The country plans to launch its mission to Mars in 2020\n\nHe said the mission, which will be China's first scientific journey to Mars, contained three steps: the spacecraft would first fly around the Red Planet, then land on it and survey it.\n\n'There are a lot of difficulties in it. If it proves to be a success, it will be the first time any country completes the three tasks in one mission,' he was quoted saying in an official social media post by Global Times.\n\n'The project is very innovative,' he added.\n\nChina has built a mock base-camp in the Gobi Desert to mimic the landscape and living conditions on Mars.\n\nThe Martian simulator, which cost approximately \u00a317 million ($22.3 million) to build, opened its doors to the public in April.\n\nThe white-coloured base has a silver dome and nine modules, including living quarters, a control room, a greenhouse and an airlock.\n\nA staff member demonstrates how she puts on the helmet of a mock space suit in 'Mars Base 1'\n\nChina's space agency, CNSA, hopes that the camp becomes a visiting centre for researchers and adventure-seekers alike to take on challenges that face astronauts on Mars. The white-coloured base has a silver dome and nine modules, including living quarters and a greenhouse\n\nThe Mars base simulator sits in the middle of the remote Gobi desert in China's Qinghai region\n\nUp to 60 people can be housed in the facility designed to resemble Martian accommodation.\n\nThe centre comprises several interconnected container modules including a greenhouse and a mock decompression chamber.\n\nResearch organisations and students are able to visit it to experience a Martian life on Earth.\n\nChina successfully achieved a world first when it placed lunar lander Chang'e-4 and its rover Yutu-2 on the far side of the moon at the start of this year.\n\nIt is also hoping to return to the lunar surface next year and bring samples back from the moon to the surface of Earth.\n\nThis will make it only the third nation - after the US and Russia - to accomplish such a feat.\n\nChinese lunar mission Chang'e-4 and its rover Yutu-2 (pictured) reached the far side of the moon at the start of this year. It was the first time a spacecraft had landed there in history", "description": "China has released the first picture of its Mars spacecraft, 'Mars 1', which is set to land on the Red Planet by July, 2021.
