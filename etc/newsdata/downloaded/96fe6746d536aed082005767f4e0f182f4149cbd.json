The company refused, arguing it would violate its clients\u2019 rights. The ensuing battle in court resulted in Telegram being blocked in Russia, and has been since April 2018.\n\nHowever, according to the FSB chief, it didn\u2019t really have that much to do with the privacy protection that Telegram prides itself on. \u201cTelegram works on the territory of other nations and cooperates with their security services in particular by providing them access to its resources,\u201d Bortnikov said.\n\nLike this story?
