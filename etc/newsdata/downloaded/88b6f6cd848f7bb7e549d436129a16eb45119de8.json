The carpenter has since had to give up his job, and is now too frightened to leave his house over fears strangers will stare at him (pictured before his ordeal, left, and with an ulcer on his face, right)\n\nMr Young, from Honiton in Devon, has attempted suicide twice because of the condition, thought to strike just one in 100,000 people\n\nSpeaking about how the condition has changed him, Mr Young said: \u2018It\u2019s completely ruined my life, I feel like a prisoner in my own home.\n\n'I've said to myself that I look like a zombie. I don't go out now, the weather is too cold and I can't chance it due to the risk of developing an infection.\n\n'It's the worst pain I've ever felt in my life. The only way to describe it is that it's like someone sticking in knives at various points across your body continuously.\u2019\n\nMr Young, who admitted he has been robbed of his independence because he needs help washing and dressing, added: 'If I go out people will just stare at me.\n\n\u2018Some people will come up and ask me \u201cwhat's wrong\u201d but most just stare. I'm just trying to keep myself in a bubble and focus on getting better.'\n\nMr Young started to get sores on his face in December 2017. His GP prescribed several types of antibiotics \u2013 but more ulcers kept appearing.\n\nHe claims to spend almost half-an-hour every day dressing his ulcers, which can prove fatal if left untreated\n\nFour skin biopsies failed to find what was causing Mr Young\u2019s agonising ulcers (pictured), which were getting bigger and gradually becoming more painful\n\nMr Young said the ulcers (pictured) on his face draw shocked expressions from strangers who walk past him and that he feels embarrassed by his condition\n\nHe was referred to see a dermatologist in 2018, who allegedly told him that they had \u2018never seen anything as aggressive before\u2019.\n\nFour skin biopsies failed to find what was causing Mr Young\u2019s agonising ulcers, which were getting bigger and gradually becoming more painful.\n\nMr Young, who was only diagnosed two months ago, said: \u2018For 18 months, I had no idea what was going on. I was tested for all sorts of things.\n\nHe claims the medication used to treat his ulcers have weakened his immune system and left him vulnerable to catching infections.\n\nMr Young said the ulcers on his face draw shocked expressions from strangers who walk past him and that he feels embarrassed by his condition.\n\nNow, he is trying to raise money on GoFundMe to seek private treatment in the US for the condition.\n\nHe said: 'I've tried all sorts of medication and nothing seems to work. I've been on steroids for 18 months and I've put three-and-a-half stone.\n\n'All I want is to live a normal life and to get back to work. For the condition to go away would be the world's best Christmas present. It would be a breath of fresh air.'\n\nYou can donate to Mr Young's appeal here.", "description": "Steve Young, from Honiton in Devon, was diagnosed with pyoderma gangrenosum in August, after 18 months of searching for an answer to his pus-filled boils.", "authors": ["Stephen Matthews Health Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/09/20365944-0-image-a-38_1572427086407.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
