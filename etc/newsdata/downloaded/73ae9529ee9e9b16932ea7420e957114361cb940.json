For young Yevgeniya, it was a devastating lesson about life in the Soviet Union in the mid-1930s.\n\n\u201cAs you might guess, he was part of the intelligentsia,\u201d Ms. Grinberg, who turns 87 next month , said in an interview in her one-bedroom apartment in the Wien House , a subsidized housing complex managed by the Y.M. & Y.W.H.A of Washington Heights and Inwood. After her father\u2019s five years in the gulag were up, he was sentenced to five more for no apparent reason, she said.\n\n\u201cMy mother went to see him,\u201d she said, speaking in Russian. \u201cIt was freezing where he was by the water, and they were given very thin mittens, and some of them were not given coats. It was inhumane. My father was a political prisoner, but the way they organized the camps, he was mixed in with bandits, murderers and every other type of criminal.\u201d", "description": "Yevgeniya Grinberg\u2019s father was sent to a gulag, and she fled the Nazis with her mother.
