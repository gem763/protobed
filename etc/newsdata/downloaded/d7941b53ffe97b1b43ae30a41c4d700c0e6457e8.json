Her campaign is currently waging a defamation lawsuit against the tech company over the \u201cdangerous\u201d label, and recently filed an opposition to Facebook\u2019s motion to dismiss the case.\n\nEarlier in the year, Facebook also banned British right-wing activist Tommy Robinson, who went on to become a candidate for the UK Independence Party in the European Parliamentary elections last year (EXCLUSIVE: Facebook \u2018Hate Agents\u2019 List Includes British Candidates For European Election).\n\nZuckerberg did not mention either of these high-profile bans during his speech at Georgetown. Not did he mention the platform\u2019s decision, in 2018, not to run a series of Republican and pro-Trump ads for the midterm elections of that year, including an ad from the Trump campaign addressing crime and illegal immigration.\n\nIn his speech, Zuckerberg indicated that he would not ban political ads in the future. \u201cBanning political ads favors incumbents and whoever the media chooses to cover,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhile I certainly worry about erosion of truth, I don\u2019t want to live in a world where people can only post content that tech companies judge to be true.\u201d\n\nThe Facebook CEO\u2019s comments come amid mounting pressure from Democrats, including the DNC, Elizabeth Warren, and the Biden campaign, to censor material from the Trump campaign drawing attention to corruption allegations against the former Vice President related to his dealings with the Ukrainian government.\n\nFacebook has, so far, refused to cave in to this pressure.\n\nAre you an insider at Google, Facebook, Twitter or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?
