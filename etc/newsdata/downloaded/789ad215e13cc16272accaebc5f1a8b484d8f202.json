A kid called me a stupid African and hit me.\n\n\u2018Sometimes I feel sad and angry. I stopped moisturising so my skin would go dry and dusty and I\u2019d look lighter for school.\n\n\u2018I scratched white lines into my skin, too, to try and look whiter.\n\n\u2018People stare at me and touch my hair without asking too.\n\n\u2018It just makes me feel sad and angry.\u2019\n\nFinley said the racist abuse makes him feel \u2018sad and angry\u2019 (Picture: SWNS)\n\nDevastated mum Colleen said the abuse has not been confined to the playground, recalling a recent incident where adult men started making monkey noises at her young son.\n\nShe said: \u2018I told the kids to keep walking, that the men were making noises because mummy looks silly. Fin said \u201cI know they were making the noises at me because I look like a monkey\u201d.\n\n\u2018It seems Brexit has given everyone an excuse to bring out their worst side.\n\n\u2018We want to leave but my husband has a business down here so it isn\u2019t as easy as that.\u2019\n\nOne boy, 13, has been prosecuted as a result of racist abuse against Finley, Colleen said.\n\nShe added: \u2018I\u2019m just sick of people not evolving. It\u2019s like going back in time.\u2019\n\nColleen wants more black history on the curriculum in Cornish schools in a bid to combat racial intolerance.\n\nHis mother wants better education on black history in school so that children are able to learn about diversity (Picture: SWNS)\n\nShe said: \u2018There\u2019s very little racial diversity here so it\u2019s like you\u2019ve got to hide away and get on with it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We\u2019re hoping by speaking out that others who are the victims of racial abuse down here will stand up and know they\u2019re not alone.\u2019\n\nFinley said he hopes to learn the ukulele and one day organise a music festival promoting racial diversity in Cornwall.\n\nHe said: \u2018I like being mixed race. It\u2019s when people are racist to me I don\u2019t like it, it makes me feel I don\u2019t fit in.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
