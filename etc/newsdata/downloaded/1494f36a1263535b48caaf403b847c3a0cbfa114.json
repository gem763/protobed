It Could Be Again", "language": "en", "text": "This article originally appeared on VICE US.\n\nA season of intense, human-caused wildfires in the Amazon rainforest has scorched thousands of square miles of forest, blackened the skies over S\u00e3o Paulo, and sparked international concern about the fate of the most biodiverse landscape on the planet.\n\nTens of thousands of independent wildfires have been deliberately set by humans in the Amazon this summer, making the destruction of the rainforest a purely anthropogenic phenomenon egged on by the far-right regime of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. To some, this may make it seem as if the presence of people in the Amazon is inexorably linked to the rainforest\u2019s ruin. But this viewpoint overlooks the deeper, and deeply human, past of the rainforest. To restore the Amazon in the future, it will be essential to look to that past, and humanity\u2019s persistent role in it, for guidance.\n\nIn recent years, scientists have accumulated a wealth of evidence demonstrating that the Amazon was shaped by people long before European colonizers set foot in it. Indigneous peoples, who arrived in the rainforest at least 10,000 years ago, altered the ecological landscape of the biome on a scale that has largely gone unappreciated, turning it into an important air purifier for Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\n\u201cAmazonia has long been understood as a \u2018natural\u2019 space occupied mostly by virgin forest,\u201d said Helena Pinto Lima, researcher and curator of archeology at Museu Paraense Em\u00edlio Goeldi in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil, in an email. \u201cThis pervading myth of a pristine rainforest has blinded many to what has been increasingly shown to be a cultural landscape.\u201d\n\nSatellite imagery of wildfires on August 20, 2019.

Archeologists have barely started to untangle the mysteries of this complex Pre-Columbian civilization, but recent evidence suggests the Amazon was populated by several million people before the arrival of Europeans.\n\nAmazonian tribes were decimated by diseases and genocide in the wake of European colonization as well as horrifying bouts of violence in subsequent centuries. Some populations have begun to recover in recent decades, and roughly one million Indigenous people live in the Brazilian Amazon today. Some groups number in the thousands, such as the Guajajara or Ticuna people, but there are also communities that contain fewer than 100 individuals, according to the Instituto Socioambiental, an Indigenous rights and research center based in S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nSome tribes have remained isolated and uncontacted in the forest. Even those that have established strong social connections to non-Indigenous communities often continue the traditional practices of their ancestors. While the rainforest certainly existed when the first Indigenous people settled there, much of the Amazon\u2019s lush wildlife and carbon-storing powers are a direct result of these traditions, which include plant domestication, controlled fires, and soil enrichment.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing with the Amazon is not so much \u2018culture versus nature\u2019 but rather a dispute between two different modes of human occupation,\u201d said Gabriel Soares, who is pursuing a PhD in anthropology at the National Museum of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\u201cOne has produced, over the course of thousands of years, this extremely diverse biome which has contributed immensely and in many different ways to the habitability of the planet,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe other, which causes the fires that you\u2019re seeing, can potentially have a gigantic negative impact on the planet as a whole.\u201d\n\nScientists have reconstructed some of the rainforest\u2019s ancient anthropogenic history by surveying local plant species at thousands of archeological sites. A 2017 study published in Science found that plants domesticated by Indigenous populations\u2014such as the brazil nut, maripa palm, and cacao tree\u2014are about five times more plentiful near these bygone settlements.\n\n\u201cThe closer to an archeological site, the more likely a given plot was to have a high abundance and a high richness of domesticated fruit trees and palms,\u201d said Charles Clement, a biologist at the National Institute of Amazonian Research in Manaus, Brazil.\n\nMany of the crops favored by Indigenous populations are particularly adept at sucking carbon out of the atmosphere. One study estimated that the Brazil nut tree, which can grow to 160 feet tall and live for 1,000 years, contains 1.3 percent of the Amazon rainforest\u2019s carbon by itself.\n\nThe implications of this domestication process transcended lifetimes and have played out over thousands of years, creating a carbon-storing biome that is an essential bulwark in efforts to mitigate the climate crisis. Brazil nuts, palms, and other crops also helped foster the Amazon\u2019s unparalleled biodiversity, as fruits and nuts opened new niches to native wildlife species.\n\n\u201cThe Amazon forest can be considered a natural-cultural heritage site of global importance, because the Amazonian forests hold legacies of their interactions with humans and many other species,\u201d said Carolina Levis, an ecologist at the Federal University of Santa Catarina in Florian\u00f3polis, Brazil, in an email.\n\nOne important example of the impact of Indigenous peoples on the Amazon is terra preta, a type of black soil created by millennia of human habitation, which is partly a byproduct of charring biomass. When deposited alongside the compost, manure, pottery, and dead biomatter generated by ancient settlements, the charred mix enriched the Amazonian soil with nutrients.\n\nLevis emphasized that there is a huge difference between the modern \u201cslash-and-burn\u201d techniques that are decimating the Amazon and the charring practices used by Indigenous populations to manage the rainforest environment and produce terra preta.\n\n\u201cWe need to differentiate illegal use of fire to open space for agribusiness and other large-scale agricultural activities from traditionally prescribed and controlled fire for diverse local activities,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe have a lot to learn from Indigenous societies who have developed such sophisticated practices of fire management without causing large-scale deforestation.\u201d\n\nIndigenous methods tend to involve creating small, smoldering fires from plant biomass that are covered with dirt or straw and rotated around different patches of land each season. Not only does this approach reduce the risk of uncontrolled wildfires, it captures half of the biomass carbon in the ground, which prevents the release of greenhouse gases. One 2006 study suggested that up to 12 percent of human-caused carbon emissions could be offset by switching from slash-and-burn to \"slash-and-char.\"\n\nTerra preta, besides being a boon for the climate, is also considered to be one of the most nourishing soils on Earth, and benefits farmers today.\n\n\u201cPeople today look for those soils to do agriculture,\u201d said Eduardo G\u00f3es Neves, an archeologist at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, in a call. \u201cThey are very productive and they have something which is very interesting for the tropics\u2014they are very stable. They don\u2019t leech. They don\u2019t lose nutrients.\u201d\n\nIt is an amazing example of local traditions producing global benefits. Sadly, many of the ancient sites that show strong signs of Indigenous influence are clustered in the southern Amazon, which is now undergoing a very different type of anthropogenic transformation: Rapid deforestation and harsh wildfires.\n\n\u201cThe fires that are burning happily across [southern] Amazonia are precisely the areas that are expected to have very anthropogenic forests,\u201d Clement noted.\n\nMap of wildfires, August 15-22, 2019.

While this process repeats every year in the Amazon, the 2019 season has been particularly intense because Bolsonaro refuses to enforce environmental laws and protections. As a result, deforestation accelerated leading up to the fire season, which exacerbated the resulting disaster.\n\n\u201cDuring Bolsonaro\u2019s campaign and the first seven months of his administration, he\u2019s made it clear that this kind of illegal activity is acceptable in the Amazon,\u201d Clement said.\n\nMost tragically, the devastation poses an existential threat to the same Indigenous cultures whose traditional practices have so enriched the rainforest.\n\nSuch risks to Indigenous lives, lands, and livelihoods are not unexpected, given that Bolsonaro ran a campaign that was openly hostile to the rights of tribes and communities that live in the rainforest.\n\n\u201cBolsonaro has this terrible reputation across the world and he deserves to have it because he\u2019s a terrible person,\u201d Neves said. \u201cIf there is anything good about this, it\u2019s to show us that when these guys take over, this is the world we\u2019re going to live in. There\u2019s nothing related to construction, compassion, or looking to the future. Only destruction.\u201d\n\nRebukes of Bolsonaro, both inside and outside Brazil, have placed uncomfortable pressure on his administration. Bolsonaro has become so indignant about the backlash that he floated a story, without evidence, that NGOs are behind the especially fiery season.\n\nThis plays into paranoid conspiracy theories that distort the motives behind partnerships between conservation organizations and Indigenous groups. The attempt to muddy the waters with disinformation was reflected in a leaked government presentation that argued for the immediate construction of megaprojects, such as highways and bridges, to head off international efforts to protect the Amazon.\n\nIn reality, conservation groups often advocate for the empowerment of Indigenous people\u2014not only in Brazil, but around the world\u2014because there is a large body of evidence linking Indigenous practices to better conservation outcomes.\n\n\u201cInvesting in Indigenous communities to develop their own plans for managing natural resources is vital to quelling this chaos in the largest rainforest on Earth,\u201d said Alex Antram, conservation outreach manager at Rainforest Trust, a US-based nonprofit that has protected more than 23 million acres of rainforest worldwide.\n\nThese partnerships are complicated by the chaotic land management system in the Amazon rainforest, which is rife with fraudulent property titles and land speculation schemes. When combined, all of these forces have placed Amazonian communities in danger, not only of fires, but of physical assault and murder.\n\n\u201cBecause of the current policies, [there are] increasing trends toward violence, especially along the expanding agricultural and extractive frontiers,\u201d Lima said.\n\nMany Indigenous people, and groups that support them, hope that the international focus on the Amazon fires will spur renewed efforts to protect demarcated Indigenous territories. Preserving the Amazon also depends on much stronger enforcement of environmental laws and the implementation of Indigenous land and forestry management on wider scales.\n\n\u201cWe say no to mining in our lands, no to deforestation,\u201d said O-\u00c9 Kaiapo Paiakan, a member of the Xinguan Indigenous group, in a recent video posted by Instituto Socioambiental. \u201cNo more invasions and disrespect. No more pesticides in our rivers and foods. No more criminal fires in the forest. We are with you, standing for the Amazon.\u201d\n\nNeves had just returned from the field when I spoke to him, and had seen the harrowing effects of the deforestation and wildfires up close. However, he also felt encouraged by how the disaster has galvanized Brazilians to support the natural and cultural preservation of the rainforest.\n\n\u201cI see a lot of destruction and fire, mostly in the southwest Amazon, but also you see a lot of people doing wonderful things like agroforestry, or Indigenous people getting politically stronger and having their voices heard,\u201d Neves noted.\n\n\u201cIndigenous people are the ones who can show us the way to have this wonderful forest back,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there is hope.\u201d", "description": "For millennia, Indigenous practices have enhanced the biodiversity, fertility, and carbon-sucking powers of the most biodiverse region on land.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d72a72b33bbfa0008321a4b/lede/1567796432817-GettyImages-1164446769.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.84375xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
