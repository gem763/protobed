The pain is kind of going away now.\"\n\nTrask was sporting a brace Monday, two days after taking a low hit from Auburn defensive lineman Marlon Davidson that left the QB writhing in pain. Gators coach Dan Mullen was irate over the play, but Trask said Davidson apologized and told him the hit was unintentional.\n\n--Missouri quarterback Kelly Bryant is expected to participate in practice and play in this weekend's game against Ole Miss while nursing a sprained left knee.\n\nWhile that serves as positive news for the Tigers (4-1, 1-0 SEC), they are bracing for the worst as star linebacker Cale Garrett has been ruled out indefinitely with a pectoral tendon injury.\n\nBryant had just released a 6-yard touchdown pass with 1:12 left in the first half in Missouri's 42-10 rout of Troy when he was hit low and from behind by defensive lineman Travis Sailo. Bryant had his leg bend awkwardly, and he immediately grabbed at his left knee as a penalty flag flew in for a personal foul.\n\n--North Carolina State is making a change at quarterback in advance of its Thursday night game against visiting Syracuse.\n\nRedshirt sophomore Bailey Hockman will get the nod in place of Matthew McKay, who started the first five games but is listed as the third-stringer this week for the Wolfpack (3-2, 0-1 ACC).\n\nHockman replaced McKay early in the team's most recent game -- a 31-13 loss at Florida State on Sept. 28 -- and completed 21 of 40 passes for 208 yards, with one touchdown and no interceptions. Hockman, who began his career at Florida State, will be backed up this week by Devin Leary, coach Dave Doeren said.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Florida quarterback Kyle Trask, who got hurt during the first half of the  Gators' 24-13 win over Auburn on Saturday, said Monday that his sprained left ...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
