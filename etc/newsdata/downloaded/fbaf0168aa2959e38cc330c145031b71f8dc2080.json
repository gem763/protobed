The judge added more damages, royalties and interest to bring the final judgment to $506 million. That figure would have gone higher if the appeals court had upheld the verdict.\n\nApple, in urging the Supreme Court to deny the foundation\u2019s appeal, argued that the Federal Circuit used settled law to decide that \u201cno reasonable juror could have found\u201d infringement in the case.\n\nThe microprocessor technology involved in the case provides a way for computer processors to execute instructions. The foundation claimed that Apple\u2019s A7, A8 and A8X chips in the iPhone 5s and iPad infringed its patent. A second case, which is pending, targets newer Apple processors.\n\nThe case is Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation v. Apple Inc., 18-1508.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Susan Decker in Washington at sdecker1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at jmorgan97@bloomberg.net, Ros Krasny, Laurie Ass\u00e9o\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Supreme Court refused to revive a $506 million patent-infringement lawsuit against Apple Inc. by the University of Wisconsin-Madison\u2019s licensing unit.The court rejected arguments by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation that a U.S. appeals court should have ordered a new trial", "authors": ["Susan Decker"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
