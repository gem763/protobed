There\u2019s a lot of fake facial hair involved.\u2019\n\nJamie, who went as Zoolander added: \u2018Through cross-country moves (we live in four different cities), marriages, pregnancies (Lauren was eight+ months pregnant here!!), and just life, we make time for this absolutely ridiculous group costume tradition every year.\n\n\u2018I love these women SO MUCH,\u2019 she added.\n\nTake a look at some of the brilliant costumes they\u2019ve adorned over the years:\n\nTom Hanks in 2018 (Picture: @concettajune)\n\nBill Murray in 2016 (Picture: Paige Dall)\n\nRobin Williams in 2015 (Picture: Paige Dall)\n\nWill Ferrel in 2014 (Picture: Paige Dall)\n\nJohnny Depp in 2012 (Picture: Imgur/auburnkay)\n\nMORE: The top trending Halloween costumes for 2019\n\nMORE: 6 easy scary, funny and rude pumpkin carving ideas for Halloween 2019\n\nMORE: Woman\u2019s PrettyLittleThing Halloween devil horns get stuck on her head\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Their latest get-up is Ben Stiller and some of his characters are from the likes of Starsky and Hutch, Dodgeball, and of course Zoolander.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_92889729_1572177059.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
