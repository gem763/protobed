This company recognizes they have to fight every single day,\u201d he added.\n\nSince Randolph\u2019s departure from the company, Netflix has scrapped its DVD-rental format and transformed itself into the streaming giant it is today.\n\n\u201cFrom the very beginning, this was about being a startup. Which meant, you empower people to make decisions. You do not rely on the past, you always look towards the future,\u201d Randolph said.\n\nWhy Netflix co-founder says the company 'always thinks like a startup' More\n\nAfter founding Netflix in 1997 with current CEO Reed Hastings, Randolph became the company\u2019s first CEO, running the company until 1999. The company\u2019s stock debuted at a mere $15 per share in 2002, and now trades close to $300.\n\nAlthough Randolph says he hasn\u2019t worked at the company in 17 years, the company culture is what he finds most telling.\n\n\u201cCulture, after all, is not what you say, it\u2019s what you do. It\u2019s how the founders treat each other, it\u2019s how they treat their employees,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance.\n\nWhy Netflix co-founder says the company 'thinks like a startup' More\n\n\u201cI had seven employees. You had no time to say \u2018here\u2019s exactly where to go,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAll you could do is say, \u2018meet me there,\u2019 and then trust that they would do it and figure it out.\u201d\n\nRandolph says that this strategy is fine when you only have seven employees like he did, but \u201cNetflix has 7,000 and they still run the company.\u201d\n\nIn July, the company reported its lowest quarterly subscriber growth in three years, leading to questions about whether Netflix\u2019s planned $17.5 billion investment in original content this year is packing the punch the company intended.\n\nRandolph told Yahoo that the future for any company is uncertain, saying something could \u201cabsolutely\u201d come along and overtake streaming.\n\n\u201cNobody knows anything. Who knows what\u2019s going to come next,\u201d he adds.\n\nYahoo Finance's All Markets Summit, Oct. 10 More\n\nMcKenzie DeGroot is a producer at Yahoo Finance.
