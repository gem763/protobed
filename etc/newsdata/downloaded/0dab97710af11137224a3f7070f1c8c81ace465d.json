He captioned the picture 'Dubz!'\n\nGirls trip: The GC, third right, has shared several glimpses into her Dubai holiday with pals including fellow TOWIE star Billie, 29, second right, who was sporting a sparkly red skirt\n\nOne person wrote: 'I applaud you on your weight loss but photoshopping not only deceives others but ultimately yourself ..\n\n'Skirting board is wonky behind legs and shadow doesn't look right, am I the only one seeing this?'\n\nOthers said it was 'obvious Gemma is deceiving her fans by airbrushing her pictures' and another said 'weight loss of filter'.\n\nHowever stylish Lucas Armitage, who said he took the picture and did the edit, said that he had not changed Gemma's shape in the picture.\n\nEdited? Last week fans claimed Gemma had Photoshopped her Instagram post, with them suggesting the skirting board behind her legs was 'wonky'\n\nGemma has previously spoken about her weight loss using Skinnyjabs, saying: 'I want to lose another three (stone) between now and Christmas. I don't want to be stick thin, I just want to be a lot healthier.'\n\nThis came after the reality star spoke of her plans to have a breast reduction.\n\n'I'd be really happy if I lost six stone as that would bring me down to 12 stone and a size 16,' Gemma told The Sun. 'My boobs are so big and I want to get them reduced in January, but I have to lose three stone before they can operate.'\n\nTo lose the weight, Gemma said she would undergo the injections again, explaining: 'Last time I had them, I didn't eat for four days. Literally nothing.\n\nChanges: Gemma, pictured at the launch of her perfume Diva Pink on October 21, has used \u00a3250 SkinnyJabs in the past, which she said were 'fantastic and really works for me'\n\n'I just didn't have an appetite. You just don't think about food or being hungry. It's fantastic and really works for me.'\n\nOf her breast size, Gemma added: 'My boobs are 38GG now and I think I will go down to a C or a D-cup. The operation is all booked in.\n\n'I think when you have big boobs, they can make you look bigger and I would just love to never ever wear a bra again.'\n\nIt comes after Gemma previously revealed that she only eats two meals a day and that she 'doesn't know why she is overweight'.\n\nHowever the TV personality recently revealed she hasn't stopped eating since she reportedly called 999 over fears her on-off boyfriend James Argent had overdosed.\n\nThe star admitted she was feeling stressed but vowed to bounce back and return to the gym.\n\nGemma told The Sun: 'I ain\u2019t stopped eating. I\u2019ve had a lot of stress and I\u2019ve not been to the gym in two weeks, I\u2019ve been unwell all weekend with a chest infection.\n\n'When I come back, I will get back on it, I always come out on top. 'My life always goes a bit t*ts-up but I carry on, I\u2019ve got lots of projects on the table, so it\u2019s exciting.'", "description": "Gemma Collins, 38, showed off the results of her determination to lose weight in a snap of her looking thinner than ever while wearing a colourful turban during a trip to Dubai.", "authors": ["Bryony Jewell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/00/20353442-0-image-a-159_1572394094984.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
