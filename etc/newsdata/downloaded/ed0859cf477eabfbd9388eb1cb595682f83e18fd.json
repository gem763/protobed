In the neighbouring province of Aleppo, a key spokesman and possible successor to Baghdadi also perished.\n\nKurdish forces and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported that Abu Hassan al-Muhajir was killed late on Sunday near Jarablus, a town about 140km northeast of Barisha.\n\nThe British based SOHR said he was travelling in a convoy made up of an oil tanker and a sedan.\n\nThe commander of Syria's Kurdish forces Mazloum Abdi said his group's intelligence unit carried out a joint operation with US troops.\n\nBack in Idlib growing alarm spread through jihadi WhatsApp groups over what was going on near the border with Turkey.\n\nOn one Idlib Operations room group, Hurras al-Din members reported a massive US raid in the area they thought was targeting one of their leaders.\n\n\u201cThey said the target was the home of this guy Halabi and he is a senior person in Hurras al-Din,\u201d said Elizabeth Tsurkov, a Syria and Iraq expert at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. an American think tank.\n\n\u201cThis large compound was known to be the home of this person. People in the group presented him as being with Hurras al-Din,\" she added.\n\nMs Tsurkov, who follows jihadi groups in Idlib closely, said the notoriously secretive Hurras al-Din, which has just under 2,000 fighters, was struggling financially and had witnessed a drop in numbers as it was struggling to pay salaries.\n\nIt even launched a campaign for donations last week.\n\nA financial motive may have connected the dots between the unlikely allies, but it is impossible to say.\n\nBack in Washington Donald Trump was quick to thank Turkey and Russia, which controls the airspace used to successfully complete the raid, as well as the Iraqi government and the Kurds for their intelligence assistance.\n\nSince then there has been a war between the Iraqis and the Kurds over who helped locate Baghdadi first.\n\nPolat Can, a senior advisor to the Kurdish-Led Syrian Democratic Forces, released a flurry of tweets on Monday night, claiming that Kurdish intelligence had been key to finding Baghdadi.\n\nHe said an SDF source had even managed to obtain a pair of Baghdadi\u2019s underwear to secure the DNA to use to identify him and located spokesman Abu Hassan, who was apparently on a special mission to Jarablus to secure Baghdadi\u2019s transfers to his new home.\n\n\u201cThrough our own sources, we managed to confirm that Baghdadi had moved from Al Dashisha area in Deir Ezzor to Idlib. Since 15 May, we have been working together with the CIA to track Al Baghdadi and monitor him closely, \u201che added.\n\nIraqi intelligence meanwhile said their information, gathered from a slew of arrests had been vital.\n\nWe believe he had tried to smuggle his family and that is why was exposed.\u201d Iraqi intelligence official\n\nFadel Abo Raghif, an expert in radical movements at the Wasatiyyah Centre think tank, said most of the information came from Baghdadi\u2019s brother-in-law Muhammad Ali Sajid al-Zobaie who was detained.\n\nHe apparently led them to a desert tunnel near Qaim city in Iraq where they found two hideouts filled with items, including light weapons, religious books, medical items and hand-drawn maps.\n\nMr Hashimi added that this allowed the operation room to penetrate a smuggling ring Baghdadi was using and to follow him to Idlib at the end of August or September 2019.\n\nIraqi security officers told the Reuters news agency that the arrest of Ismael al-Ethawi, another aide to Baghdadi also helped \u201ccomplete the missing pieces of the puzzle\u201d, in particular revealing the details of five men Baghdadi was meeting Syria and the different locations they used.\n\nEl-Thawi described how Baghdadi would sometimes hold strategy talks with his commanders in moving minibuses packed with vegetables in order to avoid detection.\n\nUS officials also reported that they Baghdadi\u2019s remains had been buried at sea from an aircraft in an unknown location. Echoing the anonymous sea burial given to al-Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden, Baghdadi was afforded proper religious rites according to Islamic custom.\n\nAt the same time speculation swirled about whether Isis had appointed a new leader.\n\nThe Iraqi intelligence officer, Fadel Abo Raghif and Mr Hashimi all told The Independent the most likely pick was Abdulla Qardash, a former Saddam Hussein-era military officer from Tel Afar near Mosul who like Baghdadi was jailed by the US in Camp Bucca between 2003 - 2004.\n\nThe other contenders were Abu Abdulrahman el-Jazrawy, who heads up Isis\u2019s executive body and Abo Othman al-Tunis who leads Isis's Shura council.\n\n\u201cIt is likely they will issue an obituary first followed by an election in the Shura to select a substitute,\u201d Abu Raghif said.\n\nFor now Isis has yet to make a formal announcement and the mantle has yet to be passed down.", "description": "Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the world\u2019s most wanted man, may have chosen an unlikely hiding spot within enemy territory in northwest Syria, because he was trying to organise the smuggling of family members across the Turkey border.", "authors": ["Bel Trew"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/28/18/isis-iraq-tv.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
