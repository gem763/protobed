He said the \u201cattempted coup\u201d was partially motivated by his ardent backing of President Donald Trump.\n\nFalwell, head of the nation\u2019s most high-profile evangelical college, was among the earliest Christian conservatives to endorse Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nHis allegations come after the publication of a story in Politico Magazine on Monday that alleged Falwell \u201cpresides over a culture of self-dealing\u201d at Liberty that has improperly benefited him and his family. The story cited unnamed sources described as current and former officials or Falwell associates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to dignify the lies that were reported yesterday with a response, but I am going to the authorities and I am going to civil court,\u201d Falwell said, referring to the reporter as a \u201clittle boy.\u201d\n\nHe added that Liberty has hired \u201cthe meanest lawyer in New York,\u201d whom he declined to identify, to pursue civil cases. Falwell also declined to identify the people he said were spreading the emails.\n\nFalwell is the son of the late evangelist, Liberty founder and Moral Majority leader the Rev. Jerry Falwell. He has come under increased scrutiny recently over his personal life and business investments, including his involvement in a Miami hostel.\n\nThe Hill first reported on Tuesday that Falwell had requested an FBI investigation.\n\nFalwell said he contacted the FBI last week after he learned that reporters were reaching out to Liberty employees about the emails he insists were stolen.\n\n\u201cLiberty owns every single one of those emails. It\u2019s our property. They were working for us when they used our server. And our policies make it clear every email sent on our server is owned by Liberty and if anybody shares it with anybody outside Liberty, it is theft. And so that\u2019s the underlying crime,\u201d Falwell told AP in a phone interview.\n\nAn FBI spokeswoman declined comment.\n\nCybercrime expert Nick Akerman said Falwell\u2019s assertion of a criminal conspiracy is \u201ctotally insane.\u201d Akerman said the ex-board members and employees can share emails with reporters as long as they had authorized access to them and didn\u2019t hack into someone else\u2019s account. He said trade secrets are also protected under the law, but Liberty wouldn\u2019t be able to make a case there either.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any law enforcement agency is going to be interested in this one,\u201d said Akerman, a partner at Dorsey & Whitney and former federal prosecutor.\n\nLiberty, based in Lynchburg, Virginia, was founded in 1971 by Falwell\u2019s father with just 154 students. It now boasts an enrollment of more than 100,000, including those in its massive online education program. It has become an influential hub of conservative politics, frequented by candidates courting evangelical voters.\n\nFalwell was an early and ardent Trump supporter, which created a rift on campus during the presidential campaign and has sparked controversy since.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. said Tuesday that he is asking the FBI to investigate what he called a \"criminal\" smear campaign orchestrated against him by several disgruntled former board members and employees.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Sarah Rankin", "Alan Suderman"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2015/12/09/Liberty_University_Guns.JPEG-09d56_c0-0-3555-2072_s1770x1032.jpg?96564adeafe74f5df23adafdf87d2eefa1cd333b", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
