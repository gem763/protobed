For instance, if the Singaporeans are aged 21 and above and had an assessable income in 2018 of up to S$28,000, they will receive a GST Voucher payout of either $300 or $150 in November, depending on the value of their homes.\n\nIn Budget 2019, the government announced a $1.1 billion Bicentennial Bonus to commemorate Singapore\u2019s Bicentennial and to support individuals who need more help. Some of the Bicentennial Bonus benefits were distributed over the past few months.\n\nThe government introduced the permanent GST Voucher scheme in Budget 2012 to help eligible Singaporeans offset some of their GST expenses. The GST Voucher comprises three components \u2013 Cash, MediSave and U-Save.\n\nThe Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) is paid to eligible Singaporean workers to top up their salaries and help them save for retirement. WIS payouts are targeted at lower-income workers with poor household support, with more going to older workers.\n\nThose eligible will be notified via SMS. To verify the authenticity of a SMS notification, they can check that the SMS is sent by \u201cSG-Workfare\u201d for the Workfare Bicentennial Bonus, or \u201cGSTV\u201d for GSTV \u2013 Cash (Bicentennial Payment).\n\nThese SMS notifications only inform citizens of their respective benefits. Citizens will not be asked to reply to their SMS or to provide any information to \u201cSGWorkfare\u201d or \u201cGSTV\u201d.\n\nMore information can be found below:\n\nINFOGRAPHIC: MOF More\n\nOther Singapore stories\n\n\u2018Sorry\u2019 Singapore restaurant accused of cruelty shuts down \u2018live crab claw\u2019 machine\n\nExtended operating hours for SMRT trains, buses on Deepavali eve", "description": "SINGAPORE \u2014 1.4 million Singaporeans will receive up to three of the Bicentennial Bonus benefits in November, said the Ministry of Finance (MOF) on Thursday (24 October).", "authors": ["Staff Writer", "Editorial Team"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JCUCw6p1qJm_fUYoh7pGWA--~B/aD0xNzU0O3c9MjQ4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/c2cb6440-f640-11e9-9fef-02bfd5bc0c45", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
