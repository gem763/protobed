The new H4s are still over-ear headphones, and Bang & Olufsen has streamlined the design to hide the braided cord better and make the aluminum caps more prominent (similar to the style of the company\u2019s pricier headphones).\n\nThe physical buttons have also been redesigned (although thankfully, not to the finicky touch gestures found on Bang & Olufsen\u2019s other headphones). There\u2019s now a sliding switch to power the headphones on or off, as well as the aforementioned voice assistant button, which lets you press and hold to activate Siri or Google Assistant through your connected smartphone.\n\nAlso new is an additional microphone, which the company says has been \u201cplaced at an optimal distance and angle\u201d for improved voice quality. And, perhaps best of all: the second-gen H4 headphones charge over USB-C, not Micro USB. Finally.\n\nThe Beoplay H4 second-gen headphones are available today from Bang & Olufsen for $300, the same price as the original model.\n\nCorrection, 6:06PM ET: The H4 are over-ear headphones, not on-ear headphones.", "description": "Bang & Olufsen has a new, second-generation version of its Beoplay H4 headphones out today, offering an improved design, USB-C charging, and support for your phone\u2019s voice assistant through a new dedicated hardware button and extra microphone.", "authors": ["Chaim Gartenberg", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NtICoXaTFMAz24gdoceZ8_4wmWw=/0x936:6538x4359/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19316318/2019_08_H4_2.gen_Black_6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
