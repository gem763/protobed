They are locked inside a safe inside another safe, and placed in the control rooms of the nation's four nuclear submarines, Politico reports. The safes will only be accessible to the sub's commander and deputy.\n\nMatthew Seligman, Professor of Naval History at Brunel University, told BBC Newsbeat that there are \"only so many options available.\"\n\n\"Do nothing, launch a retaliatory strike, offer yourself to an ally like the USA, or use your own judgment.\n\n\"Essentially, are you going to use the missiles or not?\"\n\nOne of the UK's Vanguard-class submarines.
