REUTERS/Tom Jacobs\n\nThe British parliament resumed on Wednesday after the court ruled that the chamber had been unlawfully suspended by Johnson, who insists he will take Britain out of the EU on Oct.31 - with or without a deal to manage the fallout.\n\nBut British lawmakers reject the most damaging, no-deal Brexit and, back at work, will now have more chance to upset Johnson\u2019s plans.\n\nWith the divorce deal stalled, the EU is expecting another delay to Britain\u2019s departure date after it was already postponed twice from the original March deadline.\n\n\u201cWe are in favour of an extension if we also see what is the way forward, will there be a general election, a second referendum, will there be a Withdrawal Agreement,\u201d said Guy Verhofstadt, an EU lawmaker dealing with Brexit.\n\n\u201cI think that there is unanimity...to say \u2018OK, let\u2019s go forward with an extension if there is a clear path to a solution and unwinding of the situation we have today\u2019,\u201d he told EU lawmakers on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nWith a national election expected in Britain by the end of the year, the bloc currently sees that as the most likely justification of anther lag - a decision that would require the unanimity of the 27 states staying on.\n\nThe problem is, however, that Britain would need to request such an extension, which Johnson vows never to do and EU Brexit watchers speculate about him possibly stepping aside to let someone else make the step.\n\nUnder the law, the EU could also formally demand a delay - which Britain would need to agree to for it to take effect.\n\nBut diplomats and officials dealing with Brexit in the bloc\u2019s hub Brussels ruled out such a possibility, saying it would risk feeding Johnson\u2019s rhetoric about distant elites trying to frustrate the will of the people.\n\nSHORT OR LONG?\n\nWith many question marks over the fate of Brexit lingering three years since Britons voted out, EU leaders meeting in Brussels on Oct.17-18 will discuss the desirable length of any such delay.\n\nThe British prime minister will not be allowed in the room.\n\nThe House of Commons has passed a law demanding that London seeks a postponement until the end of January 2020 to avoid an abrupt split on Oct.31 should no new divorce deal be reached at the EU summit in three weeks time.\n\n\u201cJanuary may be a bit too soon for us,\u201d said one EU diplomat. \u201cIt is far from clear that Britain would be able to sort itself out by then and we would risk another summit at the turn of the year to push back another no-deal prospect.\u201d\n\n\u201cA six-month delay until the end of March might be better for us,\u201d the person said under condition of anonimity.\n\nBrexit weighs heavily on the EU\u2019s work on its next long-term budget from 2021 and several diplomats said there could be no more extensions beyond mid-2020, when the bloc needs to have clarity on whether Britain would go on paying.\n\n\u201cIt could be one long or two shorter ones. Regardless, the cut-off date is in the middle of next year because we need to be able to finalise our own budget in the second half of 2020 at the latest,\u201d said a senior EU diplomat.\n\nA third diplomat stressed the message: \u201cWe have no problems with extensions as long as they do not impede with us finalising the budget, which must happen in the second half of 2020.\u201d\n\nAnother risk for granting Britain an extension next month is the more hawkish stance by French President Emmanuel Macron who, backed by the increasingly expasperated Belgian and Luxembourg leaders, has opposed granting the latest delay until Oct.31.\n\nHis camp stresses the cost of protracted uncertainty in terms of sapping the EU\u2019s political capital and attention needed to face challenges from climate to migration to international crises, as well as economic cost for companies who have invested in expensive contingency preparations for a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\u201cThis is a nightmare,\u201d Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel said at the top of his voice in an emotional speech this week that highlighted the EU\u2019s growing fatigue with the tortuous process. \u201cPeople would love to have clarity.\u201d\n\nDespite that, most EU diplomats and officials currently believe the bloc would grant Britain another Brexit lag - should London request it - to avoid taking the blame for disruptions expected in any no-deal split.", "description": "A damning UK Supreme Court ruling against British Prime Minister Boris Johnson this week has rekindled discussion within the European Union about another delay to Brexit, with the bloc drawing a line in the sand of mid-2020 at the latest.", "authors": ["Gabriela Baczynska", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434099651&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P0Q9", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
