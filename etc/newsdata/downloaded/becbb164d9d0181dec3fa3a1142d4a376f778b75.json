Everywhere,\u201d one anonymous poster on the message board 4chan wrote in response to one of Trump\u2019s angry tweets about the whistleblower. \u201cTime to rise up. Your president has asked for your help.\u201d\n\nThe quest to identify the person who crafted the politically explosive complaint against Trump has become a fixation across the most extreme corners of such platforms as Twitter, Reddit and Gab \u2014 and has spread onto conservative news sites, radio shows and TV broadcasts.\n\nThe president\u2019s scornful portrayal of the whistleblower shaped and stoked the online conversation throughout the week, as it descended into a case study of the Internet at its worst \u2014 frenetic, fueled by rumor and frequently racist, misogynistic and crude.\n\n\u201cthe whistleblower is not white,\u201d one 4chan commenter asserted Thursday, probably misreading a part of the complaint in which the whistleblower calls himself or herself a \u201cnon-White House official.\u201d \u201csee second set of bullet points on page 3. trump only has a handful of non white staff. I wonder who it might be.\u201d\n\nThe hunt for the whistleblower revealed a glimpse of how polarized partisan media and the Internet have become, in which every news event becomes an opportunity for online brawlers to steer mainstream conversations and defeat the other side.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing all the elements of information warfare play out online during this episode,\u201d said Peter W. Singer, a senior fellow at the think tank New America. \u201cThere\u2019s this crowdsourced manhunt to find out who did it, and once that identity comes out, everything in their life \u2014 what they majored in in college, where they like to eat dinner, where their kids went to school \u2014 will be pulled out in the hope there is one little nugget that can be weaponized against them.\u201d\n\nAfter the complaint was made public Thursday morning, pro-Trump commenters guessed the whistleblower is Hispanic or Jewish or Arab or African American and, many were sure, a woman \u2014 though rarely did the commenters use such delicate terms. A top choice soon became Susan M. Gordan, a former deputy director of national intelligence, though others thought a more probable candidate is CIA Director Gina Haspel.\n\nSome commenters offered names or rough demographic characteristics, while others posted photos of potential suspects. One 4chan commenter focused on former national security adviser John Bolton as a contender, posting a close-up image of his trademark bristly mustache with the words \u201cOperation Infinite Walrus!\u201d\n\nThe speculation gained energy at several key moments, beginning with the release of the transcript of a July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The frenzy accelerated with the release of the complaint itself and when Trump said the whistleblower, whom he suggested should be prosecuted, was \u201cclose to a spy.\"\n\nConservative commentator Bill Mitchell, who attended Trump\u2019s social media summit in July, replied in a tweet: \u201cNo Mr. President, that IS a spy.\u201d\n\nOn the pro-Trump Reddit message board r/The_Donald, a commenter using a pseudonym said, \u201cThis \u2018whistleblower\u2019 needs to be put in the public spotlight, and then f------ prosecute him/her to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d\n\nAnother replied, \u201cI bet the whistleblower is the fired ambassador [to Ukraine],\u201d referring to Marie L. Yovanovitch, a career U.S. diplomat recalled abruptly in May.\n\nThe guessing game took another twist after the New York Times reported the complaint was made by a CIA officer detailed to the White House. A conservative writer, Stu Cvrk, tweeted out his guess a few hours later.\n\n\u201cIs This Guy The Ukraine Phone Call Whistleblower?\u201d Cvrk tweeted, linking to a post he wrote on RedState, a conservative news and commentary site.\n\n\u201cA source known to me at the State Department, who will remain anonymous, tells me that everyone is pointing to Edward \u2018Ned\u2019 Price as the whistleblower who came forward with the accusation that President Trump \u2018abused his office\u2019 during a phone conversation with the Ukrainian president,\u201d wrote Cvrk. Price is a former CIA officer who retired in 2017 and is now a political analyst for NBC News.\n\nPrice, who was more amused than upset at the claim, said it made him concerned about the development of \u201cdiscourse that is just divorced from the facts.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of the political atmosphere that we live in now,\u201d Price said. \u201cPeople are looking for anything on which to hang their tinfoil hats.\u201d\n\nCvrk, in a direct Twitter message to The Post, stood by his assessment. \u201cYou didn\u2019t seriously think he would admit it, did you?\u201d he wrote, adding that he was insulted by the inference \u201cthat I am a tinfoil hat guy.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the Washington Examiner spread word of a $50,000 reward offered by two pro-Trump political activists known for smear campaigns, who called the scandal a \u201cnational disgrace\u201d and said they hoped identifying the whistleblower would help put \u201cthis dark chapter behind us.\u201d\n\nA post on the conservative Washington Sentinel suggested the whistleblower complaint was written by a \u201cvery organized\u201d team of individuals, based on what they called \u201cdocument analysis (grammatic profiling) software.\u201d Breitbart News said the \u201cso-called whistleblower\u201d marched to the orders of a vast operation bankrolled by George Soros, a longtime target of conservative conspiracy theories.\n\nThe whistleblower has remained anonymous. But should his or her name be publicized through the efforts of Internet sleuths, journalists or others, the consequences probably will be serious given the intensity of the fixation online.\n\nMany people in such spotlights have had their personal information \u2014 such as their home addresses, family affiliations and Social Security numbers \u2014 published through online \u201cdoxing\u201d harassment campaigns. It\u2019s not unusual for figures identified in this way to be confronted in person at their homes or workplaces.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very disruptive,\u201d said Joan Donovan, research director at Harvard University\u2019s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. \u201cThe president has already branded this person as a snitch and a spy, and that\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s lawyer has publicly called for respect for the person\u2019s privacy. But many in conservative media have shown no interest in standing down.\n\nIn response to this request, the Trump-boosting talk-radio host Mark Levin said on Sean Hannity\u2019s Fox News show Thursday night, \u201cToo bad, pal. Too late. You want to impeach our president, using this BS? We want to know all about your guy.\u201d", "description": "Their guesses have been scattershot, conspiratorial and often untethered from reality.
