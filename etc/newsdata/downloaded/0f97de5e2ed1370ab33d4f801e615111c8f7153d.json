(David Maas)\n\nA new species of pterosaur, a flying reptile, has been identified in the vast, dry terrain of Canada\u2019s badlands. On Tuesday, it was anointed as \u201cCryodrakon boreas,\u201d Greek for \u201cFrozen dragon of the north wind.\u201d\n\nThe discovery may sound like something out of Westeros (who can forget Jon Snow, beleaguered king in the north, riding Rhaegal over the icy wilderness?) but \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d fans shouldn\u2019t get too excited: According to researchers, Cryodrakon looked less like Daenerys Targaryen\u2019s fire-breathing dragons than it did a giraffe-sized, reptilian stork.\n\nThe carnivorous animal lived in modern-day Alberta during the Cretaceous period around 77 million years ago, according to a study in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. It could grow to about 13 feet tall, with a wingspan of up to 30 feet, making it one of the largest flying animals ever. It had no chewing apparatus, so it would probably eat whatever was small enough to go down its gullet, including lizards, mammals and baby dinosaurs.\n\nLike other pterosaurs, the Cryodrakon had quite awkward proportions, with a long neck, huge wings and a slender head about 3.5 times the length of its body. As one expert said, imagine a \u201cgiant flying murder head.\u201d Alternatively: \u201cA pair of wings that carry around a big head for guzzling things.\u201d\n\nResearchers said that while the pterosaur\u2019s new name was more inspired by Alberta\u2019s frigid landscape than it was by \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d they were aware that it might elicit some comparisons.\n\n\u201cYes, we had a good, personal chuckle about that,\u201d said Michael Habib, a paleontologist at the University of Southern California and a fan of the show.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Therrien, curator of dinosaur paleoecology at Alberta\u2019s Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology, noted that while modern-day Alberta is known for its harsh winters, the landscape that the Cryodrakon would have soared over in the late dinosaur age would actually have been a tropical paradise near a large inland sea.\n\n\n\nAn artist's illustration of the Cryodrakon boreas. (David Maas)\n\nThe fossils that were used to establish the Cryodrakon\u2019s holotype \u2014 a single specimen upon which the new species is established \u2014 were discovered some 30 years ago in Alberta\u2019s Dinosaur Provincial Park, known for being one of the richest sources of dinosaur fossils in the world. Until recently, however, the remains were thought to belong to an already known species of pterosaur, called the Quetzalcoatlus, first found in Texas.\n\nHabib, one of the few scientists in the world who has worked extensively with Quetzalcoatlus fossils, said that when he first saw the Canadian pterosaur four years ago, he had a hunch that it was not what he had seen before. While its neck bones were long like a typical Quetzalcoatlus, its proportions did not match up.\n\nHe enlisted the help of David Hone, a specialist in pterosaur taxonomy, the classification of organisms, who realized that the remains in Alberta were exceptionally well preserved. The skeleton that researchers worked with consisted of parts of the animal\u2019s wings, legs, neck and rib \u2014 a remarkable sample, he said, given that the bones of these types of reptiles tend to be thin and fragile, causing them to disintegrate over time.\n\n\u201cThis type of pterosaur [azhdarchids] is quite rare, and most specimens are just a single bone,\u201d Habib told SciTech Daily. \u201cOur new species is represented by a partial skeleton. This tells us a great deal about the anatomy of these large fliers, how they flew, and how they lived.\u201d\n\nHone had a \u201cEureka moment\u201d early on when he discovered a particular pattern of holes in the fossils that seemed unique, but it took him and the other researchers several years more to cross-check the specimen with pterosaur remains in Mongolia, France and elsewhere to confirm that this was a new species, he said.\n\nNow that they have, however, the possibilities for future research are expansive, Therrien said.\n\n\u201cI tell my students all the time, taxonomy is the most fundamental bit of biological science,\u201d said Hone, director of the biology program at Queen Mary University of London. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know what species you\u2019ve got, how do you know what else is going on?\u201d", "description": "The \"Cryodrakon boreas\" was one of the largest ever flying animals, research shows.", "authors": ["Rebecca Tan", "Local Reporter", "September At Pm", "Rebecca Tan Is A Reporter Working On The Local Desk In D.C.
