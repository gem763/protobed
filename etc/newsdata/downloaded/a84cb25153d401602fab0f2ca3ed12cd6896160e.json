Brian Johnston, Asbury Park Press\n\nThe World War II bomber that crashed at Bradley International Airport near Hartford, Connecticut, almost two weeks ago, killing seven aboard, clipped landing lights and touched down well short of the runway before swerving into a deicing fluid tank, the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday.\n\nThe pilot of the B-17G indicated only that he was having engine trouble \u2013 a \"rough mag,\" he told controllers \u2013 in requesting to turn back to the airport Oct. 2 after takeoff on a sightseeing flight but never indicated other trouble, the NTSB's preliminary report shows.\n\nSmoke fills the sky after a World War II-era bomber plane crashed on Oct. 2, 2019, outside Bradley International Airport north of Hartford, Conn.

The plane struck landing lights 1,000 feet short of Runway 6 and then touched down 500 feet short before wheeling to the right to strike vehicles and the deicing tank.\n\nWhile the report lays out detail about the crash of the plane dubbed the \"Nine-O-Nine\" and operated by the Collings Foundation, it does not pinpoint the cause of the accident.\n\nThe crash killed the pilot, co-pilot and five passengers. The only other member of the crew, the loadmaster, was seriously injured along with five passengers. In addition, one passenger and one person on the ground received minor injuries, the report states.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/15/b-17-crash-ntsb-says-plane-crashed-short-runaway/3984865002/", "description": "The World War II-era bomber B-17 that crashed Oct. 2 near Hartford was having engine trouble but the pilot didn't say a lot more.", "authors": ["Chris Woodyard", "Published A.M.
