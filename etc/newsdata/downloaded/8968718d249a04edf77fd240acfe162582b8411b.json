Turquoise Hill tempts copper buyers", "language": "en", "text": "For context, BHP plans to spend about $US8 billion ($11.8 billion) on capital projects every year for the foreseeable future.\n\nIs TRQ the proverbial ''dripping roast'' opportunity that comes along once in a generation?\n\nOr is there a rusty hook hiding in the tempting piece of TRQ flesh that currently dangles in front companies like Freeport & McMoran, Glencore, BHP, MMG and China Molybdenum Corporation.\n\nThere are multiple reasons for TRQ's depressed valuation, the most obvious being huge cost and schedule blowouts on an underground expansion of the mine.\n\nWhile Rio's deep pockets can easily handle the blowouts, TRQ is finding it harder given its only source of operating cashflow is the modestly-sized open pit that already exists at Oyu Tolgoi.\n\nExpectations that TRQ will need to conduct a dilutive equity raising in late 2020 have exacerbated selling, which has seen the stock lose 80 per cent of its value since February.\n\nBut that's not the only disincentive to owning TRQ; Rio's majority stake in the company has made many minority shareholders feel like second-class citizens in recent years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there's sovereign risk; Mongolian politicians regularly trumpet their desire to tear up or alter the legal agreements that underpin Rio and TRQ's involvement in Oyu Tolgoi.\n\nDecision delayed\n\nA parliamentary working party was due to recommend changes to the investment agreements last month but was delayed, adding to uncertainty over the government's support for an ownership structure that gives it 34 per cent of the mine.\n\nCanaccord analyst Dalton Baretto visited Mongolia in September and came away with increased concerns about the impact sovereign risk could have on lenders to the mine.\n\n''We are very concerned that the debt component of the funding package\n\nwill not be in place in time to prevent a slowdown on construction. The lenders have indicated that one of their primary requirements is certainty around any changes to the 2009 and 2015 investment agreements, the negotiations of which could drag on for some time given a pending election,'' he said in a note.\n\n''Additional project financing will require the approval of the government of Mongolia, who could potentially use this as leverage to bolster their negotiating position.''\n\nMr Baretto was more upbeat about the progress Rio was making on the mine, indicating the delays were not as bad as he had feared.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n''We would not be surprised to see the project completed ahead of our schedule and budget expectations,'' he said.\n\nJanus Henderson's Natural Resources Fund sold its stake in TRQ earlier this year on fears of cost and schedule blowouts, and senior investment manager Tal Lomnitzer said it was hard to see an internal catalyst that would improve TRQ's fortunes prior to the announcement of a new underground mine plan, which is not expected until late 2020.\n\nClarity needed\n\n''We still need to see clarity emerging about exactly how much it is going to cost and exactly how long it is going to take,'' he told The Australian Financial Review in August.\n\n''Given the geotechnical complexities of developing that orebody and conversations we have had with Rio Tinto it seems that clarity may take quite a while to emerge and until that point, it is hard to make a strong case for owning Turquoise Hill beyond valuation.\n\n\"Turquoise Hill does appear to be in limbo until that clarity emerges\".\n\nBut no-one will be surprised if an external catalyst, in the form of a takeover attempt, snaps TRQ out of limbo.\n\nBloomberg data now lists Credit Suisse as TRQ's sixth-biggest shareholder with about 3 per cent. The Swiss bank has been buying for someone since the Oyu Tolgoi delays became known in October 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBloomberg data suggests Credit Suisse's counter-cyclical position has increased 42-fold from 1,429,031 shares to 60,951,126 shares over the past year.\n\nHedge funds buying stakes\n\nThe ''event driven'' hedge funds that sniff out transactions are also arriving on the scene.\n\nFlorida's Pentwater Capital now ranks as the second-biggest holder of TRQ shares according to Bloomberg. It increased its stake by about 80 per cent over the past 15 months to 9 per cent of TRQ.\n\nPentwater is rarely seen on mining company share registers. According to Bloomberg, its holdings in the materials sector are either recently acquired companies such as Bemis and Versum Materials, or companies that are currently at the centre of takeover talk, like Axalta Coatings.\n\nMr Barreto estimates TRQ has a net asset value of $C4.92 a share; a far cry from the 56 Canadian cents the stock was fetching last week.\n\n''The stock is significantly oversold even after factoring in the uncertainty, and we could see a significant re-rate as the uncertainty clears up over the next 12 to 18 months,'' he said.", "description": "Acquisitive miners say there are no cheap copper assets these days, but Turquoise Hill is the exception to the rule.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c702469d0eda21e54b5d82ed0b77149224e8a291", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
