She got fungal acne across her forehead after moving to Southeast Asia (before image pictured)\n\nAfter: Chin altered the ingredients used in her skincare and it cleared up in four days (after image pictured)\n\n'Recently moved to SE Asia with intense humidity, and I'm sweating all the time,' Chin wrote, Allure first reported.\n\nChin believed that the excess sweating plus change in the climate pushed acne flare-ups across her forehead and hairline.\n\nAfter doing research, she determined that fungal acne could be the cause, and totally changed her skincare routine at the time to help her face recover.\n\n'I purged the products that contained stearic, myristic, and palmitic acid, polysorbates, and esters,' she wrote.\n\nFungal acne is different from bacterial acne because it is caused by yeast in the skin. The yeast will inflame the hair follicles in the skin and then cause bumps mirroring that of pimples.\n\nChin listed her new routine in her post that helped rid her skin of the acne flare-ups in just four days.\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a Like magic: Chin listed her new routine in her post that helped rid her skin of the acne flare-ups in just four days (pictured left: before, and right: after)\n\n'I think it's the new cleanser [Garnier Pure Active Sensitive Gel Wash] that has completely changed my skin, but I owe so much to Cosrx too.'\n\nIn the morning, Chin splashes water on her face before using Hada Labo Hydrating Lotion and Biore Perfect Face Milk UV for hydration.\n\nShe then uses the Garnier face wash at night to clean her face before applying Ketoconazole 1%, an antifungal topical. But Chin warned other Redditors about using the topical too often because it can be drying.\n\nThen she tops the skin with Cosrx AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner to help exfoliate the surface before applying Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence to provide hydration and nourishment.\n\nThe final step involves using Melano CC to complete her skincare routine, which is a vitamin C serum used to help with hyperpigmentation.\n\nFull routine: She said her new cleanser from Garnier made the biggest impact on her skin\n\n'I have sensitive combination skin (FML), so I apply it on dry spots after moisturizing, and it's only done wonders for me,' Chin wrote about the serum.\n\nOne commenter wanted to understand how Chin figured out she had fungal acne instead of the normal bacterial acne.\n\nChin explained, 'I'm no dermatologist, but I assumed that my skin reaction was fungal after noticing differences from the occasional bacterial pimple I'd get here and there. The location (hairline, even on the sides of my cheeks), the look and feel of the breakout, and the itchiness were all different from what I experienced before. Also, the reaction did not get better with benzoyl peroxide, so I was actively searching for answers!'\n\nThough her skincare routine worked to help solve the breakouts, it is not guaranteed to give the same results to other people based on their own skin conditions.\n\nExperts recommend consulting with a dermatologist if someone experiences similar symptoms and is unable to resolve them within three weeks.", "description": "A woman named Elizabeth Chin shared on Reddit her transformation pictures.
