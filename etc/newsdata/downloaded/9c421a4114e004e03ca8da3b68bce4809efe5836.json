He said: \u201cIt is punishing our customers, first; it is punishing our brand; it is punishing the 90 per cent of colleagues who have already accepted this 11.5 per cent deal.\u201d\n\nThe BA boss\u2019s adversary is Brian Strutton, general secretary of Balpa. He said: \u201cPilots are standing firm and have shown just how resolute they are today.\n\n\u201cBritish Airways needs to start listening to its pilots and actually come up with ways of resolving this dispute.\u201d\n\nCaught in the middle: almost 200,000 passengers who had booked on BA for the strike days and some flights on either side.\n\nRelative tranquility is expected on Tuesday as well, with British Airways again cancelling all but a handful of the normal 850 daily flights.
