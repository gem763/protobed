It also coincided with a host of current and former administration officials raising concerns during closed-door testimony about the administration\u2019s Ukraine policy.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMulvaney indicated he felt the behavior was nothing out of the ordinary, telling reporters to \u201cget over it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy,\u201d Mulvaney said during a rare press conference in the White House briefing room. \u201cThat\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nHis comments threaten to erode the administration's narrative that there was no quid pro quo between Trump and Ukraine and may bolster the Democrats' impeachment probe.\n\nMulvaney walked back his remarks hours later as unease built over his press briefing, where he indicated that the administration had held up almost $400 million in military assistance to Ukraine in part because Trump wanted Kiev to investigate an unsubstantiated allegation about Ukraine\u2019s involvement in the hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) server in 2016. The theory undercuts Russian involvement in the hack and the U.S. intelligence community assessment about election interference by Moscow.\n\nMulvaney blamed the media for misconstruing his comments and advancing \u201ca biased and political witch hunt against President Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server,\u201d Mulvaney said in a statement. \u201cThe only reasons we were holding the money was because of concern about lack of support from other nations and concerns over corruption.\"\n\nTrump later defended Mulvaney, telling reporters in Texas that while he did not watch the press briefing, he has \u201ca lot of confidence\u201d in his acting chief of staff.\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed there was \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d in his dealings with Ukraine. Under fire over revelations he pressed Ukraine\u2019s leader to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenWarren warns Facebook may help reelect Trump 'and profit off of it' Trump accuses Biden of 'quid pro quo' hours after Mulvaney remarks Testimony from GOP diplomat complicates Trump defense MORE, Trump has insisted his reason for putting a hold on security assistance to Ukraine was out of concern European countries were not contributing enough.\n\nMulvaney argued Thursday that efforts by Trump to urge Ukraine to investigate the Bidens had nothing to do with the aid being withheld.\n\nBut he did acknowledge that the aid was tied in part to Trump\u2019s desire for help investigating the hack of the DNC server \u2014 something viewed by the president\u2019s critics as a politically-motivated effort to undercut the U.S. intelligence community's conclusion that Russia interfered with the election in 2016 to benefit his campaign.\n\n\u201cThe look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the things that he was worried about in corruption with that nation. And that is absolutely appropriate,\u201d Mulvaney told reporters at the White House Thursday, arguing it was related to an ongoing Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation.\n\nWhen asked if what he described was a quid pro quo, Mulvaney responded, \"We do that all the time with foreign policy,\u201d comparing it to when the administration cut off aid to Central American countries to pressure them to curb migrant flows.\n\nA senior DOJ official, when asked about Mulvaney\u2019s remarks, said, \u201cIf the White House was withholding aid in regards to the cooperation of any investigation at the Department of Justice, that is news to us.\u201d\n\nTrump allies scrambled Thursday afternoon to distance themselves from Mulvaney\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cThe President's legal counsel was not involved in acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney's press briefing,\u201d Trump\u2019s personal attorney Jay Sekulow Jay Alan SekulowOn The Money: Trump announces limited trade deal with China | Appeals court rules against Trump over financial records | Trump expands authority to sanction Turkey Pelosi calls court ruling in Trump financial records fight a 'validation of our efforts' Appeals court rejects Trump bid to keep financial records from House Democrats MORE said in a statement Thursday afternoon.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne House GOP aide mused that Mulvaney\u2019s performance was \u201cso bad that it\u2019s plausible he was trying to get fired.\u201d\n\nFox News host and Trump confidant Sean Hannity Sean Patrick HannityHannity knocks 'dumb' Mulvaney after White House press conference Donald Trump Jr. hits back at critics over hypocrisy claims Trump's tirades, taunts and threats are damaging our democracy MORE called Mulvaney\u2019s interpretation of events \u201cidiotic.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just think he\u2019s dumb, I really do,\u201d Hannity said. \u201cI don\u2019t even think he knows what he\u2019s talking about.\u201d\n\nElie Honig, a legal analyst and former federal prosecutor, said Mulvaney may have been trying to grapple with the drips of news coming out of the impeachment inquiry suggesting there was some kind quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re calculating what they can and cannot contest. And I think they\u2019re realizing that it\u2019s getting harder and harder to contest the fact that there was some kind of quid pro quo,\u201d Honig said. \u201cI think they\u2019re trying to frame the quid pro quo in a way that will be the least damaging to Trump.\u201d\n\nMulvaney\u2019s comments reverberated across Capitol Hill, where lawmakers leading the impeachment inquiry into Trump were meeting during the day with Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union.\n\n\u201cI think Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s acknowledgment means that things have gone from very, very bad to much, much worse,\u201d House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffDemocrats want Mulvaney to testify in Trump impeachment probe Republicans seek to delay effort to censure Schiff after Cummings' death Schiff: Mulvaney comments on Ukraine aid have made things 'much, much worse' MORE (D-Calif.) told reporters.\n\nRep.

I don\u2019t like President Trump\u2019s politics, so I\u2019m going to participate in this witch hunt that they\u2019re undertaking on the Hill,\u2019\u201d Mulvaney said Thursday.\n\nSondland told House investigators on Thursday that Trump told him there was \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d related to the security assistance in Ukraine and that he wanted \u201cnothing\u201d from Ukraine, according to a copy of his opening remarks.\n\nSondland also insisted he never participated in an effort to coerce a foreign government into conducting investigations for the purpose of influencing an upcoming election, and that doing so \u201cwould be wrong.\u201d\n\nThe president has hit Democrats over the lack of transparency in their hearings, and claimed he does not know most of the current and former administration officials meeting with lawmakers.\n\nBut the parade of witnesses has underscored the extent to which the White House\u2019s strategy to stonewall the impeachment inquiry has fallen short.\n\nIn addition to those who have already met with lawmakers, five more administration officials are scheduled to give closed-door testimony next week. Mulvaney also faces a Friday deadline to comply with a subpoena from House Democrats for documents related to their investigation.\n\nScott Wong contributed.", "description": "The White House defense against Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry suffered a major blow Thursday with acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s admission that aid for Ukraine was linked to President Trump\u2019s desir", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/mulvaneymick_101719getty_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
