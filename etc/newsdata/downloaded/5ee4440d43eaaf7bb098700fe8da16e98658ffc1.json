As recently as two weeks ago, a tentative plan to hold a vote on the House floor about the inquiry drew a chorus of complaints from moderates, who privately told their leaders they had little interest in using floor time to call attention to the impeachment push.\n\nNow, Democrats have warmed to the prospect.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said from the beginning that anything that makes this process as fair and as transparent as possible is good for me and good for the voters,\u201d said Representative Elissa Slotkin, Democrat of Michigan, who resisted an impeachment inquiry for months but ultimately called for one amid revelations of Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to enlist Ukraine to smear his political rivals.", "description": "Members who have long resisted a formal floor vote are now solidly behind the idea. The change reflects Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s close hold over her caucus.", "authors": ["Sheryl Gay Stolberg"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/30/us/politics/30dc-democrats1/30dc-democrats1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
