But with the nice price came an endless stream of headaches.\n\nIn addition to having to put tens of thousands of dollars into repairing the place, it was hard to find a good router capable of providing Wi-Fi to every room. This is a must since both my wife and I work from home.\n\nSo far, we've found that mesh Wi-Fi systems are the only things that can reach every nook and cranny of our lair. These are multi-device systems consisting of a main router and one or more satellites, or extenders. Of the half dozen or so mesh systems I've tested, the TP-Link Deco M4 Mesh Wi-Fi System is the most affordable and has the best parental controls.\n\nRead more: The best mesh Wi-Fi systems you can buy\n\nAt $168, the Deco M4 is reasonably priced and comes with three routers; set up took around 30 minutes\n\nThe Deco M4 comes with three identical routers, all cylindrical and white so they'll blend into any home. One serves as the main router and connects directly to your modem. The other two are satellites designed to extend the reach of your Wi-Fi coverage.\n\nHere are the specs of the system:\n\nDual-Band (5 GHz and 2.4 GHz)\n\nAC1200\n\nEach unit has two ethernet ports\n\nCovers 5,500 square feet as a system\n\nProvides connectivity for up to 100 devices\n\n2-year warranty\n\n24/7 technical support\n\nControllable with Alexa\n\nWPA/WPA2 wireless encryption\n\nWireless type: 802.11a/b/g/n/ac\n\nFor more specs, check out the Deco M4's product page.\n\nSetup was seamless, and I didn't experience any hiccups along the way.\n\nIt only took about half an hour from opening the box until I was able to stream a video on my computer. This was relatively fast since I was essentially installing three routers instead of one.\n\nThe app provided step-by-step directions that were easy to follow too in case you don't know how to. As I installed each router, it gave me helpful tips on where to position them in my house. Once everything was in place, I updated the firmware and was ready to go.\n\nSpeeds didn't slow down even when I used more than eight devices at once\n\nThough the speeds aren't amazing, the Deco M4 provides good enough Internet to every corner of my 4,000-square-foot home and beyond. Right next to the modem, the Wi-Fi speeds were 185.2 Mbps download and 222.1 Mbps upload in my tests.\n\nIn my office, next to one of the satellites, the Wi-Fi speeds were 17.8 Mbps download and 17.3 upload. With a wired connection to the satellite, there was a slight bump in speeds \u2014 20.6 Mbps download and 38.3 Mbps upload.\n\nIn the far corner of my unfinished basement, which is a floor below and 50 feet away from the main router, I still had 17.9 Mbps downloads and 14.4 Mbps uploads. And in front of my neighbor's house, about 100 feet from the modem, the speeds were 7.2 Mbps download and 4.9 Mbps upload.\n\nBest of all, when we run several devices at once including three computers, three phones, a tablet, an Xbox, and countless smart home units, we don't notice any degradation of streaming quality or any slow page-load speeds.\n\nThe parent controls work as advertised too. With so many router brands moving toward paid parental control subscriptions, it's refreshing to find a system supported by free and effective parental controls.\n\nThere are several ways to control your children's access. With the app, you can block specific sites, which can help with productivity. You can also block content based on what is age-appropriate, and set usage time limits or specify what times you want the Internet to be turned off on certain devices. In my tests, all of these services worked well.\n\nYour Internet speed will be limited by the router's max speed of 867 Mbps\n\nDepending on how fast your Internet service is supposed to be and whether you gave a wired or Wi-Fi connection, you might feel slowed down by the router.\n\nThe Deco M4 is a dual-band AC1200 router, so it can reach speeds up to 1200 Mbps total between its two bands \u2014 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz. This works out to an 867 maximum on the 5 GHz band and 300 on the 2.4 GHz. I have fiber optic Internet that's supposed to be able to reach 1 Gbps speeds. With this router's max of 867 Mbps on a single band, I can't experience the most out of my Internet.\n\nHowever, this should be taken with a giant grain of salt. The 1 Gbps speed for my Internet is based on a wired connection, not Wi-Fi. The fastest Wi-Fi speed I've achieved using any router is 400 Mbps, well below the Deco M4's limit. So unless you're moving around massive files, you won't notice a difference between 867 Mbps and 1 Gbps speeds.\n\nI wish there were more ethernet ports on the routers. I have several devices that require a wired connection, and even one or two more ports would have been helpful. Fortunately, for less than $20, you can get a switch that will add four more ports.\n\nI'd recommend the Deco M4 system for anyone who wants consistent Wi-Fi around their home for less than $200\n\nThough the speeds didn't break any records, I was impressed with how well the Deco M4 performed despite its sub-$200 price tag.\n\nShould you buy it?\n\nIf your house is between 3,000 and 5,500 square feet, the TP-Link Deco M4 Whole Home Mesh Wi-Fi System is one of the most cost-effective mesh systems that'll reach every corner of your home and then some.\n\nIt'll serve the needs of homeowners, but if you're hoping to play graphics-intensive computer games on a Wi-Fi network in the basement or far corner where noise doesn't travel, you may have trouble getting the speeds you want. If this happens, I'd recommend connecting to the main router via a long ethernet cord or spending extra on one of the alternatives below.\n\nWhat are your alternatives?\n\nBelow are three mesh systems that I've personally tested that cost significantly more than the Deco M4 but provide faster speeds throughout my 4,000-square-foot home:\n\nOverall, I'm a fan of the TP-Link Deco M4. I strongly recommend picking it up if you're looking for a device that can reach every corner of a home of up to 5,500 square feet, especially if you want to control your children's internet usage.\n\nPros: Covers 5,500 square feet, can be used with up to 100 devices at once, excellent parent controls, intuitive app, affordable given comparable alternatives\n\nCons: Network speeds have a low upper limit (AC1200), only two ethernet ports on each unit", "description": "Dealing with dead Wi-Fi spots in your home can be annoying and costly.
