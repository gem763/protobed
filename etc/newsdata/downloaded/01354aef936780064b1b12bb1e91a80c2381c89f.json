With its Shadowkeep expansion, longtime players were introduced to some pretty extensive changes. For everyone else, Destiny 2: New Light took the base game and made it free-to-play, welcoming a host of new players to join in on the fight.\n\nIf you\u2019re one of those new players, Destiny 2 can be daunting \u2014 the game tries to explain itself, but it can be impossible to figure out what you\u2019re supposed to actually do. So I tried to sort that out, in as plain English as I can manage.\n\nAnd if this seems like a lot, don\u2019t worry \u2014 there\u2019s a quick cheat sheet at the end.\n\nYou\u2019re playing an MMO.\n\nThe biggest hurdle to enjoying Destiny has always been a cognitive one. The game is an excellent first-person shooter, with satisfying gunplay and interesting weaponry and abilities to wield.\n\nBut in order to enjoy it, you need some direction, and Destiny is frustratingly self-directed. You have to deliberately set your own goals, because while Destiny has had traditional story campaigns that can be replayed at any time, the meat of the experience is outside of them.\n\nDestiny is more like a first-person shooter version of a massively multiplayer online role-playing game like World of WarCraft or Final Fantasy XIV. It\u2019s not as varied \u2014 the mission goal in Destiny will always be \u201cshooting things\u201d \u2014 but the thinking is similar.\n\nYou\u2019re not necessarily playing to get to the end of a story, but rather working toward building a character with the perfect set of complementary abilities and weapons for handling different situations suited to your playstyle.\n\nThis is what is meant by the word \u201cendgame\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s playing until you have the things you need to make your character the best kind of space warrior they can be.\n\nDo you want to achieve that as a Warlock, summoning waves of lightning from both your hands and your guns? Or do you like being a support player, setting up shields and keeping your allies safe? Maybe you like to dive in recklessly, or keep foes at a distance. Maybe you like some combination of these things.\n\nDestiny 2 lets you build a character that excels in your preferred style \u2014 if you\u2019re willing to work for it. And since \u201cwork\u201d entails some of the most consistently satisfying gunplay in video games right now, it\u2019s not a bad proposition.\n\nGet the Lay of the Land\n\nMuch of what you\u2019ll do in Destiny 2 is divided across nine planets and moons, accessible via the Director, a menu with the map of every in-game location and quest available to you. Each Destination has an open-world Patrol space, full of enemies, treasure chests, and missions or quests you can initiate at will.\n\nYou\u2019ll rarely visit them without some sort of purpose \u2014 instead, you\u2019ll usually start your game from the Tower, a social space full of quest-givers who you can visit to direct your play. Once you\u2019re at a destination, there\u2019s also usually at least one other quest-giver worth seeing for additional goal-setting.\n\nHowever, a lot of Destiny 2\u2019s content can\u2019t be accessed from wandering around the open-world zones. Instead, you must queue into them directly via the Director. Those seeking competitive multiplayer must navigate to the Crucible menu, another game mode, Gambit, also has its own dedicated menu, and anyone seeking Strikes, Raids, or dungeons must launch them from the director.\n\nSimilarly, if you want to play the story campaigns, you either must launch them from the Director or visit Amanda Holliday in the Tower\u2019s hanger. Free-to-play players with Destiny 2: New Light have access to three campaigns: The Red War, Curse of Osiris, and Warmind.\n\nOf those three, The Red War, which is Destiny 2\u2019s original campaign, is the longest and easily the best. The latter two are brief expansions of little consequence and quite skippable, unless you find the game\u2019s renditions of Mercury or Mars fascinating and want to spend more time in them.\n\nAnyone who owns the Forsaken or Shadowkeep expansions also has access to their corresponding campaigns \u2014 the former can be queued up from the map of the Tangled Shore in the Director, and the latter by speaking to Eris Morn on The Moon. Forsaken\u2019s campaign is a close second to The Red War, while Shadowkeep is best reserved for those interested in jumping into the thick of the current iteration of Destiny 2\u2019s grind for loot.\n\nRegardless of which campaign you play through, you\u2019ll be acquiring new weapons and armour, slowly making your Guardian better.\n\nPlaying with Power.\n\nThe next thing you need to understand is what \u201cgetting better\u201d means. In Destiny, the best sense you have of that is a number called Power.\n\nIt\u2019s the biggest, most prominent number you see next to your character in the menu, and thanks to this week\u2019s New Light rework of the game, it now starts at 750. Your weapons and armour also have power ratings, and your Power is the average of everything you have currently equipped.\n\nThis gear also has an assortment of other stats, but initially Power is all that matters, and it\u2019s all that will matter until you raise your overall Power to 900. So, in order to increase your Power \u2014 which you need to do in order to take on Destiny\u2019s tougher challenges and earn the best gear \u2014 you need to find better gear.\n\nThe best and easiest way for new players to do this is to just play through Destiny 2\u2019s original story campaign, The Red War. It\u2019s the best, most fun campaign, it\u2019s available to free-to-play and paid players alike, and it\u2019s a great way to get a quick tour of most of Destiny\u2019s (really great) scenery, while upping your Power naturally.\n\nYou can kick it off by talking to Amanda Holliday in the Tower\u2019s Hanger section. (You could also grow in Power relatively quickly by jumping straight into the Crucible and playing lots of competitive multiplayer.)\n\nWhen your Power hits 900, things change a bit. That\u2019s what\u2019s called the \u201csoft cap\u201d \u2014 those loot drops you\u2019d find just through mundane activities won\u2019t really climb above 900, and you shouldn\u2019t get too precious about any of them.\n\nGear of Uncommon (green) or Rare (blue) rarity don\u2019t deserve a second thought \u2014 scrap them the instant you have something better. Legendary (purple) and Exotic (yellow) gear is worth holding onto in your vault, as raw materials for figuring out how you want to build your character. They\u2019re exclusively what you want to have as you work towards the actual max Power level of 960.\n\nTo climb that high and take on the game\u2019s biggest challenges, you have to become more discerning in what you do, working towards goals that reward you with \u201cPowerful Gear.\u201d This is where the rhythms of Destiny get a little more idiosyncratic.\n\nGet in the habit.\n\nOnce you understand Destiny\u2019s mentality, you can go about navigating the wealth of activities the game offers. It can be overwhelming and extremely confusing, but let\u2019s start with some definitions. The two biggest buckets Destiny content are sorted in are Player vs. Environment (PvE) and Player vs. Player (PvP).\n\nPvE content is the most varied, but mostly comprises activities where you (either solo or with others) take on hordes of AI enemies.\n\nThese can be story missions, strikes (like story missions, but longer and made for teams of three), dungeons, quests (multi-step tasks that usually lead to gear you can\u2019t get anywhere else) or unique activities like The Menagerie (a gauntlet of challenges run with a team of fellow Guardians.)\n\nPvP content is what will send you to the Crucible, Destiny\u2019s hub for competitive multiplayer modes. It is also, blessedly, the one part of Destiny that explains itself adequately. Give each mode a try and see what you like \u2014 maybe it\u2019s the tense 3v3 survival mode, or the more conventional team deathmatch. Playing in the Crucible can reward you with pretty good gear you can\u2019t get anywhere else.\n\nOnce you\u2019re acquainted with Destiny\u2019s offerings, you need to build a ritual, a set of things you enjoy doing enough to keep coming back to them as you hunt for Powerful Gear \u2014 necessary for some of Destiny\u2019s best challenges, like Raids.\n\nThe best way to do this is to get to know the vendors. Each activity type has a character associated with it in the Tower. Gambit has The Drifter, Strikes have Zavala, and the Crucible has Lord Shaxx. Each will offer Bounties \u2014 simple tasks you can pick up in exchange for rewards.\n\nHowever, Destiny 2 is built to reward ritual play, and most of these vendors will reward you with Powerful Gear if you complete eight bounties for them in a given week.That\u2019s your bread and butter, the stuff you can count on rewarding you with gear that\u2019ll inch you to the Power level you want to be at.\n\nYou also want to start running higher-tier activities:\n\nThe Nightfall is a weekly Strike that you can run at different difficulty tiers, each with their own set of modifiers meant to make it more challenging. Teamwork is more intensive, and on the highest settings, matchmaking is turned off and you have to go in with a team of your own.\n\nRaids are the most intense activities you can do in Destiny, requiring you to assemble a team of six for a lengthy dungeon crawl full of puzzles and combat challenges unlike anything else in the game. You\u2019ll get unique loot from them, but note that Powerful Gear currently will only come from the latest raid, Garden of Salvation, which opens this weekend.\n\nSeasonal activities are exclusive to Season Pass owners, and will cycle out every season (about 70 days.) These will have unique loot, and like most Destiny content, will be meant to be highly repeatable. However, since this is a new format for Destiny that kicks off this weekend, I can\u2019t say for sure how good a resource it is.\n\nStay alert. New quests, challenges, and activities crop up by surprise all the time. The rewards from these are often unique, and if they don\u2019t boost your Power, they\u2019ll at least be interesting, opening up possibilities for different character builds. Keep an eye out.\n\nManage your quests. In the absence of campaign missions, quests are essentially a to-do list meant to guide your play. Sometimes, instead of loot, you\u2019ll find yourself with a new Quest in your inventory while playing. These often have you do a bunch of busy work for a unique reward.\n\nBased on how much time you have to play, you may or may not find them achievable. Ignore the ones you can\u2019t possibly do, and stay abreast of the ones that seem within reach \u2014 since most of them involve going to a specific place to kill a certain types of enemies with certain types of weapons, you can find yourself with several quest and Bounty goals overlapping, multiplying the rewards you get for your time.\n\nCongratulations, you\u2019re a mechanic now.\n\nOne way of thinking about Destiny is to compare it to being really into performance cars. You start with a make and model you think suits you and proceed to make it your own.\n\nYou make big changes \u2014 adding or swapping out parts \u2014 and little ones \u2014 optimising said parts and obsessing over stats. Throughout this process, you\u2019re driving your car constantly, seeing how well its suited towards cities, closed courses, and races. Maybe you decide you want to get into drifting, and start working toward an entirely new spec sheet for that.\n\nPlaying Destiny is more of a journey than a destination \u2014 it\u2019s a big, unwieldy game built atop five years of existing infrastructure and ideas that have been discarded, tweaked, or overhauled significantly across the last half decade. You have to learn its quirks, and work around them to best suit your life.\n\nTo that end, here\u2019s some final thoughts to keep in mind.", "description": "This week, Destiny 2 \u2014 Bungie\u2019s long-running sci-fi shoot-and-loot extravaganza \u2014 got a thorough overhaul.
