These market pressures have led to vicious price wars for mobile services and, as a result, declining average revenue per user (ARPU).\n\nMaking matters worse, improvements in infrastructure and technology have made telecoms largely comparable in terms of coverage, connection speeds, and service pricing, meaning companies must transform their businesses if they hope to compete.\n\nFor many global telecoms, shoring up market share under today's pressures while also future-proofing operations means having to invest in AI. The telecom industry is expected to invest $36.7 billion annually in AI software, hardware, and services by 2025, according to Tractica.\n\nThrough its ability to parse large data sets in a contextual manner, provide requested information or analysis, and trigger actions, AI can help telecoms cut costs and streamline by digitizing their operations. In practice, this means leveraging the increasingly vast gold mine of data generated by customers that passes through wireless networks \u2014 the amount of data that moves through AT&T's wireless network has increased 470,000% since 2007, for example.\n\nIn the AI in Telecommunications report, Business Insider Intelligence will focus on the use of AI to enhance the customer experience, which can directly impact revenue. Each year, an estimated $62 billion is lost by US businesses after inferior customer experiences, according to NewVoiceMedia. We will discuss the forces driving firms to AI, pinpoint some of the top use cases of AI along the customer journey, and identify some of the leading companies in the space\n\nThe companies mentioned in this report are: AT&T, CenturyLink, China Mobile, IBM, Spectrum, Sprint, Swisscom, Telia, T-Mobile, and Vodafone.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from the report:\n\nTelecoms have long struggled with their customer experience image: In 2018, telecommunications had the lowest average Net Promoter Score (NPS), a measure of how favorably a company is viewed by customers, of any industry.\n\nCompanies that use advanced analytics, which can be accessed via AI, to improve this image and the overall customer experience are seeing revenue gains and cost reductions within a few years of adoption.\n\nMost (57%) executives believe that AI will transform their companies within three years, per Deloitte's State of AI in Enterprise.\n\nOverall, telecoms should focus on a hybrid organizational model to move beyond pilots to launch full-scale AI solutions that can have the biggest impact on their companies.\n\nIn full, the report:\n\n\n\nOutlines what factors are leading telecoms to turn to AI technology.\n\nDescribes the benefits of using AI in telecommunications.\n\nHighlights players that have successfully implemented AI solutions.\n\nDiscusses how telecoms should move forward with AI projects.\n\nInterested in getting the full report?
