Ray Villalvazo could have been let off the hook by an investigation when he killed Isiah Murrietta-Golding in 2017.\n\nAn attorney for the boy's family released the footage this week, as they prepare a civil suit against the city of Fresno, California and the Fresno Police Department.\n\nIn the CCTV video, Isiah leaps a metal fence after fleeing police.\n\nHe tumbles over before getting up and running across a grassy area while holding up his loosely-fitting trousers.\n\n(Image: Stuart Chandler)\n\nThe two cops chasing him are slower than the teen and, while one scales the fence after him, his partner crouches into a shooting position and fires through the railings.\n\nIsiah falls to the ground instantly. The Washington Post reports the bullet shattered the teenager\u2019s head just above his brain stem. The teen died in hospital three days later.\n\nAn investigation found the officer was justified in the shooting as he feared for his life.\n\nIt was held that Isiah, who was unarmed, had reached for his waistband.\n\n(Image: Stuart Chandler)\n\nThe police department said it would alter its policy for immediate threats.\n\nStuart Chandler, an attorney for Isiah\u2019s dad Anthony Golding, told The Washington Post: \u201cA picture is worth a thousand words, and this video is worth a million words.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear this shooting was not justified. He was running away, holding up his pants, posing no threat to anybody.\u201d\n\nThe civil suit filed by Mr Chandler is consolidated with a suit by the boy\u2019s mother, Christina Pauline Lopez.\n\n(Image: Stuart Chandler)\n\nIt alleges the police department is guilty of using unlawful deadly force, assault and battery, and negligence.\n\nThe civil suit claims police had stopped a car carrying Isiah and two other teenagers after staking out a home.\n\nThey were looking for his older brother in connection with a shooting that led to a fatal crash, which had taken place the previous day.\n\nPolice body camera footage shows Isiah followed police orders to get out of the car and back towards police before suddenly taking off running.\n\n(Image: Stuart Chandler)\n\nThe Fresno Bee reports that the then chief of Fresno Police Jerry Dyer claimed his officer feared \u201che was about to be shot\u201d because Isiah \u201creached into his waistband several times,\u201d and glanced back at the officers.\n\nBut the video has raised questions about this account.\n\nCurrent Fresno Police chief Andy Hall backed up the defence of the officer saying Isiah was \u201cknown to carry firearms\u201d.\n\nHe also claims that, at Isiah had jumped over a fence and onto the grounds of a \"child day care centre\", police had to take into account the danger to civilians.\n\n(Image: Stuart Chandler)\n\nBut Mr Chandler disputes this as the shooting took on April 15, a Saturday before Easter and the day care centre was empty. Meanwhile the trajectory of the bullet would have hit a window of the day centre had it missed Isiah.\n\nMichael Haddad, the attorney acting for Isiah's mum, said: \u201c[Officers] had no legal justification to point guns at Isiah, and no legal justification to seize Isiah at gunpoint.\n\n\u201cIsiah exercised his right to self-defense and to non-violently resist defendants\u2019 attempts to unlawfully seize him.\u201d\n\nMr Chandler claimed police and the city denied him access to the CCTV video and he had to acquire it later.\n\n(Image: Stuart Chandler)\n\nHe said his son was treated like \"less than human'\" when officers refused to remove his handcuffs at the request of the paramedics, who were treating his gaping head wound.\n\nIsiah's brother later pleaded guilty to killing 19-year-old Eugenio Ybarra.\n\nYbarra died after crashing into a tree while fleeing from gunshots, the Washington Post reports.\n\nMr Haddad believes officers in the Fresno Police Department misinterpreted the force's wording of its policy on the use of deadly force, which was altered in November 2016 after a separate police shooting.\n\n(Image: Stuart Chandler)\n\nThat case led to a $2.2million settlement.\n\nDeadly force was authorised if officers felt there was an 'immediate' threat, as opposed to an 'imminent' threat.\n\nMr Hadded believes officers misinterpreted 'imminent' threats to mean a danger posed in the near future.\n\nThe Washington Post reports 968 people were shot and killed by US cops in 2017.", "description": "The shocking and distressing footage from Fresno in California has sparked outcry and Isiah Murrietta-Golding's dad says his son was treated \"like less than human\"", "authors": ["Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "Stuart Chandler"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20726879.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_REPS-Police-say-shooting-unarmed-teen-in-back-of-head-was-justified-but-footage-shows-otherwise.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
