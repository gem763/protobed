I've got a boy feeling.\"\n\nLater back at home Sue adds: \"I was thinking girl then I'm thinking boy. So who knows...but now I'm thinking boy.\"\n\nNoel adds: \"We saw that little nub like thing, one minute it was this way, then it was that way. One minute it looked like a girl, then it looked like a boy, so we're not sure.\"\n\nThe 'nub theory', used by one in ten, uses the 12-week scan picture to see what angle the nub - a small lump where the genitals will develop - is pointing.\n\nThe theory says if the baby's nub points up by 30 degrees or more it is a boy. Less than 30 degrees it's a girl.\n\nSeven out of ten claim the technique accurately predicted their baby's sex.\n\nSpeaking in the Vlog before the family went away on holiday, Noel added: \"I'm thinking a boy, but I thought that last time and then it was a girl.\"\n\nSue says: \"When we were having the scan a few weeks ago it definitely looked looked girly because the nub was level but then at other points in the scan it was a bit raised and we were like oh, maybe it is going to be a boy.\n\n\"I don't mind. Boy or girl, doesn't matter. But boys are harder work than girls, definitely.\"\n\n(Image: The Radford Family/Youtube)\n\nThe couple then ask some of their other children what they would like.\n\nOscar wants a girl because \"sisters are more cute\" along with Tillie who wants \"a little sister\".\n\nThe video starts with Sue and her husband as they head to hospital while accompanied by some of their young kids.\n\n\"Hopefully we'll get to see him kicking around. We're both very excited\", says Sue.\n\nThe footage was filmed on September 29th as they went for a three month scan.\n\nThe touching clip showed them looking at their the screen and hearing their baby's heartbeat.\n\nThe couple live with the majority of their kids in the Victorian property, a former care home, which they bought almost 15 years ago.\n\nAnd now they have revealed how they manage to all live together in the 10-bed four-storey house, which includes a basement.\n\nThe Radfords first found fame in 2012 when their lives were the focus of a Channel 4 documentary called 15 Kids and Counting.\n\nBaby Bonnie was the last addition to the brood in November bringing the number of children to a whopping 21.\n\nShe arrived after a swift 12 minute labour weighing 8lb 4oz - and the couple, who have been having children for three decades, vowed she would be their last and had completed their family.\n\n(Image: TONY SPENCER)\n\nSue and Noel run their own pie business and do not claim extra state benefits.\n\nSue and Noel are parents to Chris, 30, Sophie, 25, Chloe, 23, Jack, 22, Daniel, 20, Luke, 18, Millie, 17, Katie, 16, James, 15, Ellie, 14, Aimee, 13, Josh, 12, Max, 11, Tillie, nine, Oscar, seven, Casper, six, Hallie, three, Phoebe, two, Archie 18 months, and eight-month-old Bonnie.\n\nEarlier this year, the Radfords offered a glimpse into their unique life, opening up their home to film how they live day-to-day.\n\n\"There's just stuff everywhere,\" admits mum Sue.\n\nA large Ikea storage unit hides items inside such as cardigans and blankets, while two prams - including a double one - are also stored there, with a car seat perched nearby.\n\nProudly displayed on the wall are marathon certificates and medals.\n\nA shelf of shoes also sits in another corner full of trainers, boots, wellies and dolly shoes.\n\nSue said: \"Anyone that comes in the house who hasn't been before laughs at this shoe storage.\n\n\"As you can image we go through lots of them [shoes].\"\n\nThe massive dining table takes centre stage and has 14 leather chairs and two high chairs around it.\n\nThe walls are covered in floral wallpaper while curtains beautifully drape around the bay windows as they pour in light.\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nA wooden chest of drawers proudly features a globe and pictures of a family holiday to Australia, including some of the children holding koala bears.\n\nSue said: \"I love this dining room, it's so good.\"\n\nSue has also opened up about how the family manage when it comes to summer holidays.\n\nBetween the family, they manage to take just seven suitcases away with them.\n\nSue, a stay-at-home mum, told The Sun : \"The summer holidays are a bit crazy and, with so many children, it gets very expensive.\"\n\nShe added: \"The house does get messy, it\u2019s the school holidays, I think you\u2019ve just got the accept that.\"\n\nSue said: \"The laundry is non-stop during the school holidays, too.\"", "description": "The couple, from Lancashire, revealed in a YouTube video that their new arrival is due in April next year", "authors": ["Andy Rudd", "Image", "The Radford Family Youtube", "Tony Spencer", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex Shutterstock"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20662994.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Sue-Radford.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
