You just have to be happy for her.\u2019\n\nThe run of Johnson-Thompson\u2019s crushing disappointments is well-documented \u2014 the long jump collapse at the 2015 worlds, the fall from second to sixth with a concealed injury at Rio 2016 and then the fluffed high jump which cost her a medal at London 2017.\n\nIt was after Rio that Lewis, the 2000 Olympic champion, contacted Johnson-Thompson, who had developed into a fringe contender under Mike Holmes but had hit a wall and was riddled with doubts.\n\n\u2018She was at a big crossroads,\u2019 Lewis recalled. \u2018We all knew from an early point that she had the talent to be really awesome and when I spoke with her, we went over some options.\n\nJohnson-Thompson celebrates after winning the women's heptathlon in Doha on Thursday\n\n\u2018People were saying, \u201cGo here and there\u201d, and I suggested this place in Montpellier because I knew a couple of the guys there and could reach out to them and see how things would pan out.\n\n\u2018Her training partner there, Antoinette Nana Djimou, was someone I knew so I called her to suss out everything and then we arranged to go over there and take a look, see if she could fit in.\n\n\u2018Kat was a bit hesitant, quite uncertain. People were entering the conversation about her future that had no business getting involved. Everyone knew how talented she is but they were confusing her.\n\n\u2018In the end, she went over, saw the group, saw the coach, Bertrand Valcin, and it felt right for her.\n\n\u2018I hadn\u2019t known Bertrand and he didn\u2019t speak much English and Kat not much French but immediately I could see he understood patterns of movement and I could see he had the right temperament for Kat.\n\nThe 26-year-old was overcome with emotion after reaching the pinnacle of the sport in Doha\n\n\u2018Leaving her mum and dogs was a big deal for her but she did it.\n\n\u2018That first year was hard \u2014 she had to adapt with everything and then London 2017 was hard as well, but I think she knew then that she was on the right path and it was a matter of time.\n\n\u2018It is funny. To see this very unsure athlete who had lost her self-confidence, and to have had all of those injuries, to now being on top of the world, it just makes you smile. It is amazing. And it is all her. Her hard work, her sacrifice.\u2019\n\nHer 304-point winning margin over Nafi Thiam in Doha was the biggest in a world championships since 1987.\n\nHer British record haul of 6,981 is close to the hyped 7000-point barrier and Carolina Kluft\u2019s European record of 7,032.\n\nKJT lay flat on her back after the incredible feat, which saw her smash the British record\n\nLewis thinks she can get there as her rivalry with Thiam escalates.\n\n\u2018They will push each other higher and higher,\u2019 Lewis said. \u2018The throws are key and that is where Kat can make up ground.\n\n\u2018I think she can definitely get up from 43m to 45m in the javelin and she can move from 13.8m to 14m in the shot. She is only a few minor aspects of technique away.\n\n\u2018The rest of what she does is excellent. If she gets to 14m in the shot, the pressure will really be on Thiam. A European record would be fantastic and both Thiam and Kat will improve towards it.\n\n\u2018To have two women over 7000 points in a generation would be extraordinary. Kat knows Thiam will come at her strong in Tokyo next year.\u2019", "description": "Johnson-Thompson could break the 12-year-old European heptathlon record, according to the former champion who played a major role in the transformation of her career.", "authors": ["Riath Al-Samarrai For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/23/19274512-0-image-a-43_1570141452309.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
