One of the supplemental plotlines, however, centered on Kim Kardashian West\u2019s recent health issues, culminating in an emotional phone call with her doctor.\n\n\u201cAs far as your results, your antibodies are positive for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis,\u201d explains Kim\u2019s doctor on the phone as the stony-faced reality star holds her iPhone in one hand and stretches the sore fingers of her other. As the doctor rattles off possible symptoms\u2014swollen joints, fevers, rashes, mouth sores, fatigue\u2014Kim blots her tears with a Kleenex (ever-so-lightly, to avoid smudging the full face of makeup that undoubtedly took hours to apply). \u201cI\u2019m, like, freaking out,\u201d she tells Kylie, who is there to comfort her in a butt-grazing weave identical to that of her look-alike older sister.\n\nThroughout the episode, between scenes of Khloe debating the merits of inviting estranged ex Thompson to their daughter\u2019s first birthday party and relenting to Kourtney\u2019s demands that she hire a matcha latte cart for the soiree, Kim laments her inexplicable physical symptoms. Her wrist pain interferes with her ability to play with and hold her three children (baby Psalm had not been born yet). With a baby on the way and the stress of \u201claw school,\u201d Kim says, \u201cI can\u2019t live like this.\u201d In one lighthearted moment, even an onion ring proves too heavy for her to lift with her swollen, achy hands. Luckily, the Food God is there to hand-feed his BFF.\n\nKim Kardashian Confesses She Can\u2019t \u2018Babysit\u2019 Kanye West Any Longer\n\nKim Kardashian West on \u2018The View\u2019: Yes, Trump Deserves Credit for Prison Reform\n\nSince the episode was filmed, Kardashian-West\u2019s lupus diagnosis has been confirmed (at the time, she was awaiting further test results to verify that it was not a false positive) and she has spoken publicly about managing the autoimmune disorder. She went on the Today show on Tuesday to discuss her experiences. \u201cI, unfortunately, had to be put on medication to stop the symptoms,\u201d she said in the interview. \u201cI tried everything natural for the longest time, and we chose the best route for me.\u201d Thanks to her treatment plan, \u201ceverything is under control.\u201d\n\nLupus is an autoimmune disease with varying symptoms ranging from fatigue and joint pain to headaches and memory loss. In extreme cases, the disorder can lead to kidney failure. It is one of many \u201cinvisible illnesses,\u201d including Lyme disease, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome, that disproportionally affects women. These diseases are nicknamed \u201cinvisible illnesses\u201d because they often cannot be perceived by others, due to symptoms that are not externally visible and differences in the way the diseases manifest from case to case. In addition to the disruptive pain and discomfort caused by chronic symptoms, sufferers of such conditions often struggle emotionally as they constantly have to prove to others that they are ill.\n\nBecause these illnesses are already so stigmatized, it is positive that someone like Kim K, with her army of 148 million Instagram followers, is speaking out about her medical battle. However, she\u2019s not the first celebrity to use her platform to open up about the daily challenges of living with an invisible illness. After three years of keeping quiet, Selena Gomez revealed in 2015 that she suffers from lupus as well. In a 2015 interview with Billboard, the pop star explained, \u201cI waited for the right time to talk about it because I am in a great place and I\u2019m very healthy. I\u2019m not trying to be loud about it: It was time to use my platform to help.\u201d\n\nGomez\u2019s lupus escalated to a \u201clife-or-death\u201d crisis in 2017 when the severity of her condition required her to get a kidney transplant. Her good friend Francia Raisa, who ABC Family fans may recognize from The Secret Life of the American Teenager, donated one of her kidneys to Gomez. In a moving Instagram post from after the surgery, the singer wrote that Raisa gave her \u201cthe ultimate gift and sacrifice by donating her kidney to me.\u201d She concluded the message by linking to the Lupus Research Alliance website.", "description": "Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily BeastThe season 17 premiere of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, which aired on Sunday, was largely preoccupied with familiar drama\u2014Kourtney\u2019s emotional distance from her sisters, the seemingly endless Tristan Thompson saga, and Jonathan \u201cFood God\u201d Cheban", "authors": ["Jordan.Julian Thedailybeast.Com", "Jordan Julian"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VPURlban5lQbb6qWebVQ1g--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/3e5edf2535e5f6d2448b8a8533008866", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
