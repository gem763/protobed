But federal prosecutors said those charges were just the \u201ctip of the iceberg,\u201d and that Hasson had been planning to \u201cmurder innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country.\u201d Hasson, federal prosecutors wrote in a court filing, \u201cis a domestic terrorist, bent on committing acts dangerous to human life that are intended to affect governmental conduct.\u201d\n\nHasson pleaded guilty to four counts, according to federal court records: unlawful possession of unregistered firearm silencers, unlawful possession of firearm silencers unidentified by serial number, possession of firearms by unlawful user or addict of a controlled substance, and possession of a controlled substance. The addict-in-possession charge was also used against a neo-Nazi in D.C., who was released last month after spending about 10 months in jail.\n\nFederal prosecutors said that Hasson had planned to kill Democrats and prominent journalists, and had done extensive research on a number of potential targets.\n\nIn a statement issued to reporters after his plea, Hasson\u2019s federal public defender said that Hasson had \u201cstruggled with addiction to a prescription opioid painkiller,\u201d but that the case against him had been \u201cmischaracterized and sensationalized from the start.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not a domestic terrorism case,\u201d Liz Oyer said in the statement. \u201cMr. Hasson was never plotting a terrorist attack or any of the abhorrent acts that this prosecution has repeatedly speculated about but never actually charged. Mr. Hasson is a peaceful, loving family man. He devoted his life to serving his country. He and his wife have two grown children who have gone on to do the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Hasson never meant any harm to anyone. He deeply regrets the pain and embarrassment that he has caused his family and the U.S. Coast Guard, which he has proudly and honorably served for more than 20 years,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe hope that, with Mr. Hasson\u2019s guilty plea, we can move past the rhetoric that has clouded the actual facts of this case.\u201d\n\nHasson\u2019s wife called him a \u201cloving\u201d and \u201chonorable man,\u201d and said that she hopes he comes home soon.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Thomas P. Wisdom, according to The Washington Post, told the court that the government planned to seek a possible life sentence when Hasson appears for his sentencing hearing on Jan. 31.\n\nBut U.S. District Judge George J. Hazel said that Hasson\u2019s statutory maximum would be 31 years in prison, the Post reported.\n\nMaryland\u2019s top federal prosecutor, U.S. Attorney Robert K. Hur, said in a statement that he looked \u201cforward to the opportunity for the government to present additional evidence to the Court at sentencing.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated throughout with additional details and statements.", "description": "The white nationalist Coast Guard lieutenant plotted to \u201cmurder innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country,\" the feds said.", "authors": ["Senior Justice Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d94ec16210000f602f98dbe.jpeg?ops=1778_1000"}
