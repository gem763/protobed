Clary/AFP via Getty Images Macron says he expects meeting with Trump and Rouhani US president says he does not seek leadership change, but Iran must relinquish weapons.\n\nBIARRITZ, France \u2014 U.S. President Donald Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani may meet in the next few weeks \u2014 a potentially game-changing diplomatic breakthrough \u2014 French President Emmanuel Macron said Monday at the conclusion of a G7 leaders' summit.\n\nMacron gambled by inviting Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif to fly in to Biarritz on Sunday for meetings with French and other European officials while Trump and the American delegation were just across the street.\n\nBut it was a statement on Monday morning by Rouhani that represented a major step forward, Macron told reporters as he adjourned the summit.\n\n\"It seems to me that there has been a real change,\" Macron said. \"This morning, Rouhani showed interest in this meeting,\"\n\nIn his statement, Rouhani said: \"If I know that meeting with a person will resolve the problem of my country, I will not hesitate,\" Iranian media reported.\n\nWashington and Tehran have been in a tense, and worsening, standoff since Trump last year unilaterally withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Trump has even threatened Iran with \"obliteration,\" and other leaders have grown increasingly concerned about the risk of military conflict, if not outright war.\n\nTrump at the news conference said he \u201cwould certainly agree\u201d to meet Rouhani and is prepared to negotiate with Tehran but he reiterated his threat that if Iran does not give up its weapons programs, it would be met with \"violent force,\" saying the U.S. would have \"no choice.\"\n\nTrump also repeated his bitter attacks on the JCPOA, calling it \"ridiculous.\"\n\nLooking for a better deal\n\nMacron had checked with Trump in advance of inviting Zarif to Biarritz and the U.S. president was on board with the plan, although the Iranians and the Americans did not meet on Sunday.\n\nStanding side-by-side with Trump at a closing summit news conference, Macron said he is now working to arrange a meeting that he could attend with the Iranian and U.S. presidents. Such a meeting would almost certainly also require the assent of Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei.\n\nBut securing Khamenei's approval will not be easy, especially after Macron on Sunday credited pressure on Iran from the Trump administration with helping to create conditions for improving the JCPOA.\n\n\"The sanctions that were imposed by President Trump ... create pressure and so create the conditions to improve the terms of the deal,\" Macron said.\n\nIran views the reimposition of sanctions by Washington as a fundamental breach of the agreement \u2014 and has long maintained that the renewed punishment is unjustified given Tehran's compliance with the JCPOA, which was repeatedly verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\nPreviously, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian had called the U.S. withdrawal and renewal of sanctions \"a bad decision.\"\n\n'Technical' progress\n\nMacron remained highly cautious. \"Nothing is done, things are still eminently fragile,\" he said. \"But there are discussions that were initiated on the technical level with progress.\"\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, in response to news of Zarif's visit, told reporters that Trump had always expressed willingness to open negotiations with Tehran \"without preconditions,\" provided that the Iranians were willing to come to the table.\n\nThe European architects of the nuclear deal \u2014 France, Germany and the United Kingdom, as well as the EU \u2014 have remained committed to it, despite Trump's withdrawal and Iran's decision to back away from its own obligations.\n\nMacron has been working aggressively in recent weeks to create conditions for brokering a deal that would preserve the JCPOA and also address Trump's concerns, which go beyond Iran's nuclear program to include its ballistic missile program and its involvement in regional military conflicts in the Middle East.\n\n\"We have to be sure that Iran will never get a nuclear weapon,\" Macron said at the news conference.\n\nTrump's remarks, as usual, were a mixture of bombast, digressions to recall personal friends who have worked in construction development in Iran, and repeated references to Iran's potential to be a great country \u2014 punctuated by a short aside about how he holds a similarly optimistic view of North Korea.\n\n\"We're not looking for leadership change,\" Trump said. \"We're looking for no nuclear weapons, no ballistic missiles.\n\n\"I really believe Iran can be a great nation,\" he added. \"But they can't have nuclear weapons, ok?\"\n\nAt the news conference, Trump also praised Macron's handling of the G7 summit.\n\n\"There was tremendous unity,\" Trump said. \"There was great unity.\"", "description": "US president says he does not seek leadership change, but Iran must relinquish weapons.", "authors": ["David M.
