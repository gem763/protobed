Don't go to America, Jurgen.\n\nWin or lose, it is customary in the NFL that players face the music in the locker-room. It's all part of the engrossing 21st century extravaganza American Football puts on for the media and fans.\n\nLast night at Tottenham, the Chicago Bears lost, rallied and lost again in a humdinger of a tussle against the Oakland Raiders and following the 24-21 defeat, the Bears locker room was understandably eerie and gloomy as it opened its doors to the media.\n\nIt was a full house for the first ever NFL match at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday\n\nThe Chicago Bears were the favourites but quarterback Chase Daniel (No 4) failed to fire\n\nUnlike the use of two changing rooms for one team at Wembley, the state-of-the-art NFL-specific facilities at Tottenham means there's plenty of space for the 53-man roster and support staff as a cluster of reporters, camera-crew and sound engineers are added to the mix.\n\nAfter a 10-12 minute 'cooling-off' period, the players must front up and do their media duties no matter where they are in their post-match process.\n\nThe media pack, led ultimately by American broadcasters, huddle around the locker room as they wait for their prized asset to emerge from the showers.\n\nDon't worry, they'll let them get changed, but only after an undeniably awkward 'turn-of-the-back' situation in which the player has to master the art of dressing with a towel round his waist.\n\nChicago running back Tarik Cohen wore sunglasses as he answered questions from the press\n\nBears coach Matt Nagy spoke in a press conference environment, away from the locker-room\n\nWhen ready, the entourage swarm towards the player and his locker for a general Q&A situation which goes like this: short, direct questions receive unsurprisingly short, direct answers, as a myriad of dictaphones and phones are sprung near enough in the vicinity so the athlete can be heard. No photos, but video recordings are permitted.\n\nOnce the journalist and their cameraman give each other a knowing look, they thank the athlete for their time and retreat speedily to the middle-floor, loitering uneasily by the locker of the next wanted name.\n\nElsewhere in the inner sanctum, as you can imagine, the mood is melancholy. Players have their heads down as they scroll through their phones, desperate not to catch the glance of any onlookers.\n\nReporters waited in a huddle near Allen Robinson's locker before the wide receiver came over\n\nKit and gear is sprawled messily on the floor, only cleared by support staff once the players leave their surroundings. Some change into official franchise uniform whilst others maintain their own 'home-clothes' style \u2013 like mufti-day at school.\n\nIn general, there's decorum, but unorganised decorum. Interview zones are random, as are the order of questions. There's no moderator as such, so be sharp and quick with your questioning or be swamped by others quicker.\n\nOn Sunday, superstar receiver Allen Robinson II was the main attraction, and fronted up well to the glare of the cameras and journalists.\n\nRobinson (No 12) made a sensational catch on the sideline in the second half of the game\n\n.@AllenRobinson speaks to the media following today's game in London. pic.twitter.com/eo2qfevUUq \u2014 Chicago Bears (@ChicagoBears) October 6, 2019\n\nFrom a British perspective, it is extremely alien. But from an American standpoint, it is simply the way it works.\n\nThere is a sense of entitlement from the media. A journalist from the States, in queuing for the locker-room, could not believe the cooling-off period may have extended to more than 15 minutes, and made his feelings known to the Bears press officer.\n\nInside, you can effectively go and talk to whoever you want, about whatever you want. The players know the score too and by and large impressively play their part.\n\nSo, at the home of Tottenham Hotspur, a team where changing-room access could make or break them right now, could English football learn from this?\n\nWhile for some, the safety and security of the changing room is quite understandably paramount, others have been more recipient.\n\nManchester City's record-breaking 100-point season was documented as a fly-on-the-wall show on Amazon Prime, and received rave reviews as football lovers got a taste of Pep Guardiola's man-management and tactical nous.\n\nIn rugby union too, the Lions tour opens its doors to a fly-on-the-wall series every four years, But on the whole, such a phenomenon is new to us; very much a step into the unknown.\n\nIn many respects, it signifies the contrast in spectacles. While in the UK, you go every week to watch a sports fixture, in the US you go and watch a show of glamour and entertainment, where sport is the focus but by no means the sole focus.\n\nNeedn't perhaps it be said, but the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is simply a perfect venue for it too. Strobe LED-lighting, a giant screen in each corner and a venue design which maximises every single decibel of noise, it has given London NFL a fresher and glitzier feel already, following the traditional regularity of Wembley and Twickenham.\n\nWembley hosted the first NFL 'International Series' game in 2007 and it has grown ever since\n\nWhile distracting spectators from the action on the pitch is a route the Premier League shouldn't go down, there is a case to be said for livening up non-game entertainment, something different from the usual battle between two fans running round the pitch or having a penalty shoot-out competition.\n\nSimilarly, there is no desire from clubs and governing bodies to willingly open up dressing-rooms after games.\n\nThe difference in access in stark however. While in the NFL the media have their full pickings, in the Premier League a journalist will be fortunate to obtain a quote from a player un-obliged and reluctant to speak in post-match 'mixed zones.'\n\nYet an increase in visibility with documentaries on streaming platforms and 'tunnel-cams' on club YouTube channels illustrate the landscape is changing. For now, Klopp can relax, but the irrevocable safety and security of the changing room is no more.", "description": "KIERAN JACKSON AT THE TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR STADIUM: Win or lose, it is customary in the NFL that players face the music in the locker-room, sometimes just 10 minutes after games finish.", "authors": ["Kieran Jackson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/16/19402768-0-image-a-2_1570462323326.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
