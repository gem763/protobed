REUTERS/Sergio Moraes\n\nSpeaking at Rio\u2019s Offshore Technology Conference on Tuesday, BP Regional President for Latin America Felipe Arbelaez said he believed a plant being built by a consortium of BP, Germany\u2019s Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) and Brazil\u2019s Prumo Logistica SA (LLXLF.PK) could eventually be fired by offshore gas rather than imported liquefied natural gas (LNG), as plans now forecast.\n\n\u201cAssociated gas can definitely compete with LNG in Brazil, and there is tons of associated gas,\u201d Arbelaez said, using a term for the gas pumped from fields that primarily produce oil.\n\n\u201cBP, over time, if I had to guess, will be satisfied with associated gas,\u201d he said.\n\nOffshore gas is considered both a problem and opportunity in Brazil. The country is quickly ramping up oil production in offshore fields, many of which have significant gas volumes.\n\nTraditionally, gas produced in such fields is burned off or \u201cre-injected\u201d in a process that increases crude production. But some fields coming online have too much gas for those processes to remain viable.\n\nAt the same time, there are few pipelines to bring the gas ashore and domestic consumption is weak.\n\nThe government is encouraging more gas infrastructure, and firms with gas-heavy fields, such as Norway\u2019s Equinor ASA (EQNR.OL), are looking at building pipelines and onshore terminals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re convinced that there is a need for additional infrastructure to be built,\u201d Arbelaez said. \u201cWe believe there is probably a need for between two to three ... gas processing corridors in the next 10 to 15 years.\u201d\n\nDuring the same panel, executives from Equinor and Portugal\u2019s Galp Energia SGPS SA (GALP.LS) also said they expected to be selling offshore Brazilian gas to consumers within the next two years.\n\n\u201cI have the certainty that Galp will be selling gas in the next two years to clients,\u201d said Miguel Pereira, chief executive of Petrogal, a Galp unit. \u201cWe have to surpass some barriers but we are dealing with it.\u201d", "description": "BP Plc wants to be part of an effort to build up natural gas infrastructure in Brazil, an executive said on Tuesday, and believes a power plant it is building in Rio de Janeiro could eventually be supplied by gas from offshore oilfields here.", "authors": ["Gram Slattery", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446341386&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S21F", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
