Beto O'Rourke Scrambles Dems' Gun Message", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s \u201chell yes\u201d moment at the Democrats\u2019 presidential debate is scrambling his party\u2019s message on guns.\n\nThe Democrats have long contended their support of gun control laws does not mean they want to take away law-abiding citizens\u2019 firearms. But on Friday, they struggled to square that message with their presidential contender\u2019s full-throated call on national TV for confiscating assault rifles.\n\n\u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47, and we\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against your fellow Americans anymore,\u201d the former Texas congressman declared during Thursday night\u2019s debate.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s hometown of El Paso was the site of a mass shooting last month that killed 22 people, and he has put the issue of gun violence at the center of his campaign effort. On Friday, his campaign hawked T-shirts emblazoned with his debate vow.\n\nHowever, some fellow Democrats chastised him and fretted that his remarks may have made things harder for gun control supporters as they negotiate with President Donald Trump on legislation to respond to this summer\u2019s mass shootings.\n\n\u201cI frankly think that that clip will be played for years at Second Amendment rallies with organizations that try to scare people by saying Democrats are coming for your guns,\u201d Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware told CNN Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t think a majority of the Senate or the country is going to embrace mandatory buybacks. We need to focus on what we can get done.\u201d\n\nHis fears about new rages against gun control supporters seem sure to be borne out.\n\n\u201cThis is what their goal is. We\u2019ve always said it, now they\u2019re saying it,\u201d said Alan Gottlieb of the Second Amendment Foundation, based in Washington state. \u201cNow they\u2019ve said it and we\u2019re going to make them eat it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Coons is working with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania on a measure to require that law enforcement officials be notified when someone fails a gun-purchase background check. Toomey, who is also working with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia on the firearms issue, agreed that O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments could backfire.\n\n\u201cThis rhetoric undermines and hurts bipartisan efforts to actually make progress on commonsense gun safety efforts, like expanding background checks,\u201d he said.\n\nO\u2019Rourke was less provocative in his language but still determined Friday.\n\n\u201cMuch respect to Sen. Coons for leading the fight on background checks,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cBut the time for letting status quo politics determine how far we can go is over. If we agree that having millions of weapons of war on the streets is a bad idea, we have to do something about it.\u201d\n\nOne worry among Democrats is that calling for outright confiscation plays into claims by Trump and other Republicans that Democrats are coming for people\u2019s firearms.\n\nOn Thursday night, just as O\u2019Rourke made his call to take back the rifles, Trump warned at a Republican retreat in Baltimore, \u201cDemocrats want to confiscate guns from law-abiding Americans, so they are totally defenseless when somebody walks into their house.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, Trump promised, \u201cwill forever uphold the fundamental right to keep and bear arms.\u201d That line got huge applause at the GOP retreat, and again Friday when it was repeated there by Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nBy all accounts, Trump needs to run up the score in rural areas to win reelection next year. The 2020 outcome is expected to depend heavily on a trio of Rust Belt states \u2014 Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 that have large numbers of rural voters, many of whom are gun-owners or sympathetic to owners on this issue. And Democrats\u2019 hope of winning control of the Senate rests on states with high rates of gun ownership, like Arizona and Texas.\n\nSeveral gun control groups stressed Friday that they were not advocating confiscation, but they also didn\u2019t follow Coons\u2019 lead in condemning O\u2019Rourke\u2019s declaration.\n\n\u201cI think it is very understandable that he is taking a policy position that the larger gun safety community hasn\u2019t taken and he\u2019s trying to push the envelope,\u201d said Robin Lloyd, managing director of Giffords, the gun control group named after Gabby Giffords, the Arizona congresswoman who survived a gunshot wound to the head in 2011. \u201cIf the American voter does not think this is an appropriate solution, they\u2019ll let us know.\u201d\n\nGun rights groups have seemed to be somewhat on their heels recently as the unabated series of mass shootings has increased pressure for new control measures. Even the staunchly conservative lieutenant governor of Texas, Dan Patrick, said he supports background checks for all gun purchases after the El Paso attack and a second mass shooting in the state. Infighting and investigations at the National Rifle Association and election wins by pro-gun-control Democrats last November have convinced some politicians that the winds have shifted on the gun issue.\n\nIndeed, O\u2019Rourke isn\u2019t alone. None of the other nine candidates on the debate stage contradicted him on his proposal to require owners of the two popular styles of assault rifles to sell them to the government. Two candidates \u2014 New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and California Sen. Kamala Harris \u2014 have also called for mandatory buybacks of assault weapons. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, asked if she agreed with O\u2019Rourke Thursday night, allowed only that she preferred a voluntary buyback to a mandatory one.\n\nAll 10 of the Democrats onstage have called for an assault weapon sales ban, the latest sign of how the party has become emboldened on gun control.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to overstate how much the politics of gun safety has changed \u2014 whereas candidates once avoided gun safety entirely, now they\u2019re jockeying to be the boldest,\u201d said Taylor Maxwell of Everytown, the gun control group founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\n\nProposals like background checks and so-called red flag laws, which allow authorities to confiscate guns from people who are deemed threats, are \u201curgent,\u201d she said. \u201cToo many lives are on the line not to take these simple, broadly popular and bipartisan steps immediately.\u201d\n\nBut O\u2019Rourke\u2019s remarks worry Democrats like Warren Varley, who lost a race for a state legislative seat in Iowa last year.\n\n\u201cThe lines like, \u2018We\u2019re gonna come and take your AR-15,\u2019 just play into the fears that the NRA has been stoking, and a proposal like that is just going to make rural Iowa and I think probably rural areas elsewhere more red,\u201d Varley said. \u201cI think that\u2019s just a bridge too far for most rural folks, and it conjures up images of the government coming in and invading your home and images of big government trampling over the rights of individuals.\u201d\n\nTrump and White House aides have discussed a number of gun control measures with members of Congress, including steps to go after fraudulent buyers, notify state and local law enforcement when a potential buyer fails a background check, issue state-level emergency risk protection orders, boost mental health assistance and speed up executions for those found guilty of committing mass shootings.\n\nA formal announcement on the president\u2019s plan is expected as soon as next week.\n\n__\n\nRiccardi reported from Denver.
