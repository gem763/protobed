Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWhile the 37-year-old Serena Williams and her opponent, the upstart Canadian teenager Bianca Andreescu, could hardly be more different in terms of the depth of their experience, their styles are a near mirror image.\n\nWilliams, who is seeking an elusive record-equalling 24th Grand Slam singles title, has looked as good as ever during her stay at Flushing Meadows \u2014 crushing serves and pounding groundstrokes to reach her second major final of the year.\n\nStanding in her way is 19-year-old Andreescu, a fellow big-hitter and excellent mover, who took the tennis world by storm this year when she came out of nowhere to claim titles at Indian Wells and Toronto.\n\nOn the eve of the biggest match of her life, Andreescu\u2019s coach Sylvain Bruneau told reporters she would not be intimidated by Williams or the moment.\n\n\u201cTomorrow is a tough task, for sure the toughest task she\u2019s had this year in her young career,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut she\u2019s a warrior and she\u2019s a street fighter. She strives to compete.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty confident she\u2019s going to step in the arena tomorrow, both feet in, and go at it,\u201d he said of the contest, which will play out before a raucous, Williams-supporting crowd at 23,771-seat Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s as tough as it gets as a competitor. She\u2019s not scared. She goes for it ... the bigger the occasion, the bigger she hits.\u201d\n\nWILLIAMS ON A MISSION\n\nWilliams will look to avoid the sort of dip in form she suffered in last year\u2019s U.S. Open final and in the last two Wimbledon finals.\n\nThose defeats have kept her just shy of Margaret Court\u2019s Grand Slam record since returning to the sport last year following childbirth.\n\nHer wealth of experience and excellent fitness, not to mention the laser-like focus she has brought to each of her first six matches in New York, could be enough to finally carry Williams to the Promised Land.\n\nHer coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, also believes her familiarity with the big stage could give her an edge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called pressure, and I think Serena had to experience a bit of pressure in her life,\u201d he said of the 37-year-old, who learned tennis as a child from her father on courts in crime-ridden Compton, California.\n\n\u201cAnd you can\u2019t think that she\u2019s not good at dealing with pressure.\u201d\n\nWilliams appears fully recovered from the knee injury that forced her to pull out of the Miami and Rome tournaments earlier this year after just one match, giving her already lethal game an added dimension.\n\n\u201cIf you feel weak or not as strong as you wish you were, it\u2019s more difficult to beat the pressure,\u201d Mouratoglou said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a totally different situation now, because now she can move.\n\n\u201cIf she needs to play the rally, she can play the rally. We have seen that I think a few times during the tournament.\n\n\u201cSo there is no panic if she misses a bit more than usual. No problem. There are other options of play.\u201d", "description": "The U.S. Open final on Saturday will have the feel of a street fight when two of the most powerful players in the women's game exchange blows on the sport's biggest stage with Grand Slam glory on the line.", "authors": ["Rory Carroll", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190907&t=2&i=1427206382&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF860CB-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
