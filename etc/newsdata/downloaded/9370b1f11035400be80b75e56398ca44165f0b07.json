He was arrested in 2017, and released on bail. His jail sentence was handed down after pressure from the public and members of the Iranian parliament.\n\nIranian media said Fereidoun was jailed because he \u201callegedly paid money to certain individuals in charge of bribing banks and other influential sectors of the economy for large sums.\u201d\n\nThe judiciary spokesman indicated that Fereidoun could face more punishment for additional charges. Tuesday\u2019s announcement was actually phrased as a bit of good news for the defendant, who had his sentenced reduced from seven years to five.\n\nRouhani supporters believe Fereidoun, a close aid to the president, has been unfairly scapegoated for corruption, and was deliberately targeted by \u201creligious hardliners\u201d in the judiciary who wanted to apply political pressure against Rouhani.\n\nFereidoun was involved in negotiating the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), i.e. the Iran nuclear deal, which was supposedly a victory of Iranian \u201cmoderates\u201d over \u201chardliners\u201d for which the latter want revenge.\n\nThe judiciary also announced the death sentence for \u201cwide-scale acts of espionage and cooperation with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency\u201d against an individual who was purportedly part of a U.S.-British spy ring. The other alleged conspirators were given ten-year prison sentences.\n\n\u201cThe director of the Intelligence Ministry\u2019s counterespionage department said the spies had been employed in sensitive centers or worked in private sector firms related to these centers active in the economic, nuclear, infrastructural, military and cyber areas,\u201d Iran\u2019s Tasnim news agency wrote on Tuesday.\n\nAl Jazeera noted Iran has been announcing huge busts of U.S. spy rings over the past few months, with at least one other death sentence ostensibly carried out According to Al Jazeera:\n\nIt was not immediately clear if any of the cases were linked to Iran\u2019s announcement in July that it captured 17 spies working for the US spy agency, CIA. Occasionally, Iran announces the detention of spies it says are working for foreign countries, including the US and Israel. In June, Iran said it executed a former staff member of the Ministry of Defense who was convicted of spying for the CIA. In April, Iran said it uncovered 290 CIA spies both inside and outside the country over the past years.\n\nAt the same press conference, the Iranian judiciary confirmed for the first time that a British-Iranian anthropologist named Kameel Ahmady was arrested in August due to \u201csuspected links to institutes affiliated with foreign intelligence services.\u201d\n\nThe UK Independent noted Ahmady has a history of writing about issues the Iranian regime finds uncomfortable, such as women\u2019s rights and child marriage.", "description": "Iran sentences President Hassan Rouhani's brother to five years in prison for corruption and sentences an alleged CIA spy to death.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Hossein-Fereidoun-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
