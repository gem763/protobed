Bands of Morales' supporters and opponents fought in a number of places across the country, including the capital La Paz.\n\n\"There is a heightened risk of social unrest at the moment,\" Rodrigo Riaza, a research analyst for Latin America and the Caribbean at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said.\n\nArgentina, too, is braced for tumult this weekend as market-friendly incumbent Mauricio Macri looks set to lose the second round of a presidential run-off to big-spending Peronists.\n\nWith the economy shrinking and annual inflation at more than 53 per cent, Macri's unsuccessful handling of the economy has disappointed his supporters and contributed to the popularity of opponent Alberto Fernandez among moderate voters.\n\nIn Chile, Pi\u00f1era's predecessor as president, Michelle Bachelet, issued a statement calling for dialogue and urging all sides to work \"toward solutions that contribute to calming the situation\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow the UN high commissioner for human rights, Bachelet called for an investigation into all acts, by government or protesters, \"that have caused injuries and death\".\n\nThe protests have shaken a nation noted for economic stability over the past decades, which has seen steadily declining poverty despite persistent high rates of inequality.\n\nThe unrest was triggered by a relatively minor increase in subway fares of less than 4 per cent, but analysts said the protests were fed by frustration from a long-building sense among most Chileans that they are not sharing in the nation's advances.\n\n\"I'm protesting for my daughter, for my wife, for my mother, not just for the 30 pesos of the Metro - for the low salaries, for the privileges of the political class, for their millionaire salaries,\" said Andres Abregu, an Uber driver who complained he was still paying a student debt and cannot provide a decent life for his family.\n\nAAP", "description": "Protesters defied an emergency decree and confronted police in Chile's capital, continuing violent clashes, arson and looting that have left at least 12 dead.
