His partner, Tracy, is a Qantas flight attendant and Marston thought it'd be pretty neat to capture a photograph of a plane she was staffing flying across the moon.\n\nHe started experimenting with solar and lunar photography, and soon began observing other aerospace phenomena.\n\n\"I noticed that planes look very pretty when they go overhead with the right atmospheric conditions -- they produce rainbows behind them, with the vapor,\" Marston tells CNN Travel.\n\nWhen an airplane is flying at high altitude, there's a decrease in pressure and the temperature of the air drops, explain experts at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the German Aerospace Center. If there's enough moisture in the air, the vapor forming behind the aircraft freezes, generating ice crystals.\n\nScientists from NASA say the ice crystals form when cold air condenses around particles from the plane's exhaust.\n\nThe remarkable rainbow effect happens when the crystals are aligned at the right angle with the sun, explains NASA.\n\nOn June 2019, Marston shot video footage of this marvel, capturing the moment when a Qatar Airways Boeing 777 flew over Brisbane, with stunning rainbow contrails.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Marston took photographs of rainbow contrails, but it's the first time he captured it on video.\n\nTechnicolor marvel\n\nl e v a r t\n\nThe photographs and footage are so striking, they almost look like they've been doctored.\n\nThey're not fake, though, Marston is adamant. He says he's got the raw files to prove it, and in the past, he's posted the files on his personal Facebook account to silence naysayers.\n\nIt's just a scientific curiosity, he says, albeit one that you're not likely to see clearly with the naked eye, simply because the airplane's usually so high.\n\n\"It requires specialized camera equipment to capture it,\" says Marston, who, a few months ago, finally realized his dream of capturing the moment Tracy's aircraft passed by the moon.\n\n\"I was pretty stoked about that,\" he says.\n\nMarston's proud of all his atmospheric shots of airplanes, whether they're emblazoned in front of a crimson sun, eerily silhouetted against the moon or captured generating a technicolor burst of rainbow contrails.\n\nStill, he has plenty of failed attempts amongst those triumphs.\n\n\"It's a bit like fishing,\" he says. \"I enjoy the thrill of catching something -- and also have the agony of going out and catching nothing. It can be rewarding and at the same time absolutely frustrating.\"\n\nRelated content Photographing storms from the best seat in the sky\n\nSerendipitous connections\n\nMarston took this photograph of a Qantas Boeing 737 crossing the moon.
