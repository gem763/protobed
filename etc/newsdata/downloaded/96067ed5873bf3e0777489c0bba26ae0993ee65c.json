The strike will disrupt waste collection and trains, buses and trams, as well as schools, museums and pharmacies.\n\nRaggi urged the unions on Tuesday to cancel the strike \u201cfor the good of the city\u201d, arguing that its citizens did not deserve the ensuing mayhem.\n\nWith opposition politicians and residents calling for her to resign, as well as criticism from members of her own party, frustration over the city\u2019s management is mounting.\n\nMassimo Tabacchiera, president of the Lazio unit of Confapi, the union representing small and medium industrial companies, said the strike originated from \u201ca city that is tired and lacks perspective\u201d. He added: \u201cThere has never been a plan for Rome and this administration continues to navigate only by undertaking small measures and neglecting every long-term infrastructure project.\u201d\n\nBoth the Democratic party and the far-right League have launched separate petitions seeking Raggi\u2019s resignation. The League\u2019s leader, Matteo Salvini, said 10,000 people had signed its petition within a few days.\n\nRome\u2019s residents have organised a \u201cpassive march\u201d along the Tiber river on Saturday morning under the slogan \u201cenough of Raggi\u201d. The protest comes exactly a year after thousands demonstrated outside the local authority to decry the city\u2019s scruffy condition. \u201cRaggi\u2019s administration has transformed the city into one to escape from instead of one that enables us to live with dignity,\u201d the organisers wrote on a flyer advertising the protest.\n\nRome mayor accused of trying to change waste disposal firm's accounts Read more\n\nSome of Raggi\u2019s initiatives have had a positive response, including introducing an Uber bike-sharing scheme, and recycling machines at three underground stations that people can use to exchange plastic bottles for metro tickets.\n\nUntil recently, she continued to be backed by the party, but Vincenzo Spadafora, M5S\u2019s minister of sport, admitted this week the administration of Rome had been \u201cdifficult\u201d and that the whole party should take responsibility. Barbara Lezzi, an M5S senator, defended Raggi, arguing that she had \u201cinherited the destruction that all other parties had committed over the course of decades\u201d.\n\nNeither Raggi or her spokesperson were available for comment.", "description": "Many blame M5S\u2019s Virginia Raggi for a drastic decline in the city\u2019s services", "authors": ["Angela Giuffrida"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe9757305537dd9e842c2a92bf4d9e8227b1af46/0_141_2288_1373/master/2288.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=96b1db02099da9e6b7f0a7bcb5d675d8", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
