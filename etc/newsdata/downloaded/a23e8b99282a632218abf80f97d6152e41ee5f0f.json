Another vehicle then pulls up to witness the sight.\n\nAs the warthog continues to screech, a hyena runs into frame from the right heading straight for the leopard's catch.\n\nWhen the hyena moves in, the lucky warthog is able to spring to its feet and face the leopard head on.\n\nIt headbutts the creature sending it springing back before sending it flying into the air with its tusks.\n\nThe warthog sprints away, pursued by the hyena and leopard.\n\nIn the scuffle, the warthog manages to flip the leopard on its back but the beast quickly hops up and forces the warthog to the ground (left). With it's belly facing up, its desperate victim squeals as the leopard chomps down (right)\n\nGame ranger Daniel Hitchings, 22, who witnessed the spectacle said: 'Sightings-wise, it was relatively quiet, so we drove around and joined a sighting of a male leopard where other safari vehicles were also parked.\n\n'We spent quite some time at the spot, watching the leopard move against the wind, which then lead him to a steenbok, then impala.\n\n'We were surprised to note that he suddenly lost interest in the impala to focus his attention on the huge hole just below him which I knew was an active warthog burrow.\n\nAs the warthog continues to screech, a hyena runs into frame from the right heading straight for the leopard's catch\n\n'It was all so sudden. We watched the leopard's behaviour change. First, he was still very uncertain if the hole was empty or not.\n\n'Within five minutes of us waiting in anticipation, a huge warthog made a dash for it and in a split second the leopard jumped on top of the warthog, catching a ride mid-air and tripped the warthog with pure weight and surprise.\n\n'We sat in total astonishment.'\n\nHe added: 'Just as we thought it was over, a hyena appeared from the thickets and ran towards the sound of the squealing warthog.\n\nWhen the hyena moves in, the lucky warthog is able to spring to its feet and face its predator head on before running away\n\n'This was a once in a lifetime sighting! You know it's an extremely special sighting when you see the reactions of the other rangers too, who have witnessed all types of other animal behaviour.\n\n'It's on days when you expect the least that sightings like this one blows your mind.\n\n'So all I can advise it to take it all in! Although sightings like these are often hard to watch, this is nature in its rawest form.'", "description": "Visitors watched the jaw-dropping hunt at the Sabi Sabi Private Game Reserve, South Africa.
