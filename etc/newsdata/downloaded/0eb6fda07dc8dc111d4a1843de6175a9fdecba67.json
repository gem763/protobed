The U.S. should look for candidates with a development and finance background, a demonstrated interest in the current footprint of the EBRD, and someone who has a demonstrated pro-American, anti-Russian worldview. For example, a strong candidate could be from the Baltic countries, parts of Central and Eastern Europe, or other European countries who are signaling concerns about Russia through increased defense spending and burden sharing in NATO.\n\nThe EBRD was founded in 1991 and was originally established to \u201chelp build a new, post-Cold War era in Central and Eastern Europe\u201d by \u201cfurthering progress towards market-oriented economies and the promotion of private and entrepreneurial initiative.\u201d Over time, its mission has evolved \u2014 for example, the EBRD ended any new business in Russia in 2014, and it began to work in countries in the Maghreb as a response to the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011 \u2014 and there are valid questions on if it has evolved too far.\n\nThere is a legitimate debate to be had about the future of the EBRD. The current geographic footprint of the EBRD is large, consisting of 39 countries. There are easily a half dozen to a dozen of these 39 countries that could \u201cgraduate\u201d from the EBRD in the next three to five years. There is no reason why the EBRD couldn\u2019t maintain its current (or a reduced) geographic footprint and the next president of the EBRD focus on that footprint for his/her notional two four-year terms. Within this geographic footprint, the EBRD may want to consider expanding its service offerings (e.g. infrastructure) or expanding its activity in equity investments. Thirty-six percent of the EBRD\u2019s projects currently qualify as climate change-related projects, and they have a goal of 40 percent by 2020. The EBRD has mostly gotten out of the oil, gas, and coal business, which is unfortunate because there are a handful of strategic projects where the EBRD could be helpful.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe EBRD does not need to be perpetually growing to be important and effective. There is still a lot of work to be done in Central Asia. There is a nascent democracy in Kyrgyzstan, there is an emerging democracy in Uzbekistan, and there is potential for some promising changes in Kazakhstan. The EBRD is a major instrument of indirect U.S. influence in Central Asia. Ukraine now possesses its best government of the last 30 years, but unfortunately Ukraine is going to be collateral damage of the current American political crisis over impeachment. One of the ways for the U.S. to continue to constructively influence Ukraine is through the EBRD. We still have unfinished business in the Balkans and Caucasus. The EBRD has also ramped up a significant amount of work in the Maghreb and should continue to do so.\n\nIn the last 10 years, questions about the mission of the EBRD have increased since many countries who were original targets of the EBRD\u2019s work have become prosperous and free societies (e.g. the Baltic countries and Central European nations). At the same time, the interests of the original stakeholders, namely the United States and Europe, have also drifted. Europe is now increasingly concerned about climate change and Africa, while the U.S. (and somewhat Europe) has become increasingly concerned about China.\n\nThe current president of the EBRD, Sir Suma Chakrabarti, is a well-regarded leader in global development and has led the organization for the last eight years. The new president of the EBRD will be elected in May 2020 and there will be a decisive board meeting in December. The United States owns 10 percent of the bank\u2019s shares. Collectively 28 EU states hold 63 percent of the total. Traditionally, the presidency of the EBRD has gone to a European.\n\nAdditional things to consider are an important report called the \u201cWise Persons\u2019\u201d report on development finance. This seemingly obscure report, published last week, has enormous implications for the future of the EBRD and American interests in the global system.\n\nThe report contemplates three options for Europe to handle a number of challenges \u2014 how to finance the challenges of climate change, how to enable prosperity and jobs in Africa, how Europe should respond to the China challenge, and how the diffuse alphabet soup of European development and development finance entities can work together more effectively. Of the three options listed in the Wise Persons\u2019 report, two of them contemplate a fundamental change in the future impact and role of the EBRD.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAfter reading the Wise Persons\u2019 report and speaking to more than three dozen European and American officials, it is clear that Europeans have taken very seriously the semi-public statements from one or two Trump administration officials who have said that the United States has contemplated \u201cselling its shares\u201d in the EBRD.\n\nThe process of how this notional U.S. exit would be achieved \u2014 or achieved without America losing its shirt along with its influence \u2014 is not completely clear. In the most likely scenario, the U.S. would receive the original money it committed in 1991, not the much larger accumulated profits associated with our 10 percent ownership. This would be a very bad financial deal for the United States and catastrophic in terms of loss of influence and impact for the United States.\n\nFinally, the well-reasoned U.S. National Security Strategy under President Trump Donald John TrumpCharles Barkley: 'Vice President Pence needs to shut the hell up' Democrats say whistleblower deposition no longer central to impeachment investigation: report Trump plans to appeal House subpoena for financial records to Supreme Court MORE has four main points \u2014 one of which is that \u201cthe U.S. will compete and lead in multilateral organizations so that American interests and principles are protected.\u201d Selling our shares would absolutely go against this. Therefore, it would be wise for U.S. policymakers to make a clear public statement now that it will not sell its shares in the EBRD because it is now apparent that European shareholders have taken these recent unofficial statements as truth and are examining serious options that would harm U.S. interests.\n\nOne would also think that Congressional leaders would want to understand why the United States would not only lose its shirt, but also cede U.S. influence to China and Russia in a key part of the world.\n\nThe EBRD presidency search will also be complicated by the traditional \u201cEuropean consolation prize\u201d dynamic. A number of other European candidates who fought for positions in the European Investment Bank (EIB), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the European Central Bank (ECB) will all be clamoring for the EBRD, saying it is \u201ctheir turn.\u201d There will be a very strong dynamic to \u201ctake care of\u201d candidates from other countries who lost out. The U.S. needs to signal now that there may be some candidates they will not accept; or, the U.S. needs to get behind an alternate European candidate.\n\nWe cannot fight something with nothing. The EBRD does approximately $10 billion per year in investments and is an important source of our influence over a large region of the world. The EBRD is the multilateral organization that covers the most countries along China\u2019s Belt and Road network. It would be a huge mistake for the U.S. to sell its shares, and it would be a grave error if the U.S. does not become involved in the presidency search. Arguably, the next candidate for the EBRD presidency is the most important personnel pick in the 30 years of its history.\n\nDaniel F. Runde is a senior vice president and William A.
