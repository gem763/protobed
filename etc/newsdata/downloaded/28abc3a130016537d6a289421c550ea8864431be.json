I was their designated driver. I saw some smoke coming from Portage and Main and I couldn't figure out where it was coming from,\" said Pacaud, who captured video of the event.\n\nFirefighters searched the building to ensure no one was inside and spent hours battling the fire.\n\n\"We had a complete roof fire with partial collapse into the elevator shaft, allowing the fire to come down into the basement,\" Winnipeg fire-paramedic service assistant chief Service Jason Shaw said at the scene on Sunday.\n\nThe building is still at risk of collapsing, he said Sunday morning before firefighters left the site.\n\n\"Crews did make entry to see what they could do. The stairwells were full of smoke and heat, and with the heavy load of the fire on the roof, they retreated out,\" he said.\n\nInstead, firefighters used aerial ladders, along with existing scaffolding, to fight the flames from the outside. They also used a drone and the police service chopper to direct crews.\n\nOn Sunday morning, Winnipeg blocked off intersections east of the intersection of Portage and Main.\n\nFire crews are still on the scene controlling a fire that engulfed the brick building. (Tyson Koschik/CBC)\n\nThe seven-storey brick building is a municipally designated historic building known as the Keewayden Building or the Jacob-Crowley Building.\n\nBuilt for the Notre Dame Investment company in 1909, early tenants of the building included architects, the Austria-Hungary consulate and a cigar company.\n\nIn 1928 it was sold to the Jacob-Crowley Manufacturing Company, which started out making women's clothing. During the Second World War, the company made 75,000 garments for the Canadian army and navy.\n\nThe building, designated in 2017, has an assessed value of $3.1 million, according to the City of Winnipeg's website..\n\nThe Jacob-Crowley Building is a municipally designated historic building, which was once a garment factory. (Nathan Kramer/Manitoba Historical Society)\n\nPacaud said it's unfortunate to see a heritage building suffer so much damage.\n\n\"This neighbourhood, as beautiful as it is being revitalized \u2014 and they're building so many beautiful things \u2014 something historic is being taken apart,\" he said.", "description": "Winnipeg fire crews spent early Sunday dousing\u00a0a blaze in an historic seven-storey\u00a0building\u00a0in the city's downtown after flames engulfed the roof in the early\u00a0morning.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5301927.1569763639!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/138-portage-fire.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
