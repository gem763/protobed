While the vaccine has only proven to be partially effective in trials, it\u2019s the first vaccine of its kind to be approved by regulators.\n\nKenya introduces malaria vaccine\n\nMalaria kills one child every two minutes globally and remains the biggest killer of children under the age of five in much of Africa \u2013 including Kenya. The disease infected roughly 219 million people in 2017 and killed around 435,000 with the vast majority of deaths being babies and young children in the poorest parts of Africa.\n\nDespite significant progress in preventing cases in recent decades, numbers are on the rise again. Mosquitoes who transmit the disease from one human to another are becoming increasingly resistant to repellants and the pollution prevalent in cities while the disease itself is becoming resistant to antimalarial drugs in many parts of the world.\n\nMeanwhile, Mosquito nets given to people in many African nations, as part of earlier drives to tackle the disease, have become worn or damage with many people unable to replace them.\n\nThe vaccine being introduced in Kenya is called Mosquirix (RTS,S) developed by British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline. It needs to be administered over four doses and only provides limited protection against malaria but the World Health Organization has said it could save tens of thousands of lives.\n\nFeatured image: Public domain", "description": "", "authors": ["Aaron Brooks", "View All Posts Aaron Brooks", "About Aaron Brooks", "Aaron Brooks Is A Uk Journalist Who Wants To Cut Out The International Agendas In News.
