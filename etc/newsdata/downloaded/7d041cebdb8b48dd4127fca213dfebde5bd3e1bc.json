The franchise was upfront about the possibility, Iguodala is a smart man who understands the business of the league, there are no hard feelings.\n\nHowever, he doesn\u2019t want to play for Memphis. The Grizzlies don\u2019t just want to buy him out \u2014 unless he\u2019s leaving a lot of money on the table, which he will not do \u2014 they want to trade him for picks or a young player coming back to help their rebuild.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThat left the sides at an impasse, but they have reached an agreement that allows Iguodala to not report to training camp and instead keep working out on his own, reports Chris Herrington of the Daily Memphian.\n\nAndre Iguodala will not attend Grizzlies\u2019 Media Day on Monday nor report to the team\u2019s training camp under an arrangement reached between the two sides, according to team and league sources. Iguodala will remain on the Grizzlies roster, likely well into the season. However, the team agreed the veteran can continue private workouts at a location of his choosing while Memphis pursues trades involving the former Golden State Warrior and NBA Finals MVP.\n\nThis almost certainly drags out into December, and likely much closer to the Feb. 6 trade deadline. On Dec. 15 the players who signed contracts this summer can be traded, opening up the trade pool. By then, contending teams \u2014 or, teams that fancy themselves contenders \u2014 will have a better sense if they could use Iguodala off the bench to boost a playoff run. And if they have the players and picks to get a trade done.\n\nIguodala talked about his situation in Memphis with NBC Sports Bay Area\u2019s Monte Poole over the weekend.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out things on both sides. They\u2019re trying to figure out some things, and I\u2019m trying to figure out some things. As of today, we\u2019re on the same page. Camp opens the next week. We\u2019ll see. We\u2019re on the same page, though.\u201d \u201cAt this point, the only buyout that makes sense \u2014 if I\u2019m speaking on someone else\u2019s behalf, thinking as an agent \u2014 is you don\u2019t leave money on the table,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially in this league. Because you\u2019ll never get it back, no matter what people say. Negotiations are a tactic, so you\u2019ve got to be careful how you approach it, or how you verbalize what you would do going forward. But you can\u2019t leave anything on the table.\u201d\n\nIguodala is in the final year of his contract, worth $17.2 million this season, and he wants to get paid. The Grizzlies want to jumpstart their rebuild. The best option for both sides is just to wait it all out, which is what they have decided to do.\n\nFor now. Expect Iguodala rumors to start ramping up around Christmas.", "description": "The Grizzlies don't want to buyout Iguodala, but there hasn't been much of a trade market for him, yet.
