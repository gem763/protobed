Police in Schaumburg, 30 miles west of the city, say they still don't know why Garcia crashed his black Chevy Trailblazer through the entrance of the Woodfield Mall on Sept. 20.\n\nThe investigation revealed that Garcia was acting alone, police said in a statement. Garcia was transferred from a mental health facility back to police custody Friday.\n\n\u201cPolice have no reason to believe Garcia was targeting any specific person or store within Sears or Woodfield Mall,\u201d the statement said.\n\nVideo posted on social media showed the SUV driving around inside Woodfield Mall, slamming into kiosks as shoppers dashed for safety. A person in the video can be heard saying in disbelief, \"Yo this is not happening right now.\" Others in the background yell \"Stop! Stop driving!\" The car tires screech as the car navigates the mall.\n\nNo serious injuries were reported.\n\nWitness Lateef Farooqui told CBS Chicago he was in the mall when he saw the vehicle rolling through \"like you would a shopping cart.\"\n\nSchaumburg Police Chief Bill Wolf said after Garcia's arrest at the scene that there appeared to be no connection to any terrorist group or cell. Police said the alleged attack met the elements of felony terrorism because the damage took place in a building with five or more businesses and totaled more than $100,000.\n\nPeople shop at a Sears store on March 22, 2017, in Schaumburg, Illinois.
