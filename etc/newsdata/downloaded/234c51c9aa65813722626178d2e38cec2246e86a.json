Financial conditions are also not tight. In addition, the savings rate rose to 8.1% in August. That means consumers have a \u201ccushion\u201d to survive slower growth, he said.\n\nClarida offered no explicit forward guidance about whether the Fed would cut rates again at its meeting on Oct. 29-30.\n\nThe Fed has cut rates by a quarter-percentage point at its past two meetings, in July and September.\n\nWeak economic data over the past few days has raised investor expectations that the Fed would cut rates again when it meets at the end of the month.\n\nInvestors now see a 90% chance of a quarter-point cut later this month. That\u2019s up from a 40% likelihood last week.\n\nClarida refused to be drawn into the discussion about the probability of an October rate cut, saying only that the Fed would \u201cact as appropriate\u201d to sustain the expansion.\n\nClarida didn\u2019t seem too concerned by the recent weak data, saying that the global economy has been slowing for more than a year. The Fed has already factored in that U.S. manufacturing was being hurt by this slowdown, he said.\n\nAt the event, Clarida defended Fed Chairman Jerome Powell from one audience member, who criticized Powell for what he said was \u201crookie malfeasance.\u201d\n\nClarida replied that Powell was doing \u201ca fine job.\u201d\n\nOnly seven of 17 Fed officials have called for another rate cut this year, according to the Fed\u2019s \u201cdot-plot\u201d projections of interest rates. But this minority includes Clarida and Powell, and they have managed to pull the majority of the committee along with them in the first two rate cuts. There were three dissents in September.\n\nIn an earlier appearance on Thursday, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan seemed open to considering another rate cut in October.\n\nFriday\u2019s employment report could be pivotal for the outlook for interest rates. Economists expect that the economy added 150,000 jobs in September.\n\nRead: Another poor U.S. jobs report would add to Wall Street gloom\n\nStocks rebounded a bit Thursday after a sharp selloff earlier in the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.47% rose 122 points, or 0.5%.
