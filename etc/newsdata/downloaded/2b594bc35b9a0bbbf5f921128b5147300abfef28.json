There are no plans to charge the women, but it is unclear what will happen to their adoption plans, Milstead said.\n\nA neighbor, Bella Perez, said she has lived in the neighborhood for about a year and saw \u201ca lot of\u201d pregnant women and women with children coming in and out of the home. She thought maybe they were all part of a family living together, she said.\n\nWhen she saw several law enforcement officers in the area Tuesday, she thought it was a drug bust. Then a reporter knocked on her door, and she found out what had happened.\n\n\"That\u2019s crazy, that\u2019s like a lot. How can you do that to kids?\u201d Perez said of Peterson and the allegations against him. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy how a neighbor of yours is doing all those things and you don\u2019t even know.\u201d\n\nThe charges came out of a multistate investigation involving the Arizona Department of Public Safety, Homeland Security Investigations and the Utah Attorney General\u2019s Office, according to the Arizona Attorney General's Office.\n\nThe Utah attorney general charged Petersen with 11 other felonies, including communications fraud, human smuggling and sale of a child.\n\nHe also faces 19 federal charges, filed in the U.S. District Court for western Arkansas, related to allegations he illegally brought four people to the United States who continue to reside there.\n\nAn investigation by Honolulu Civil Beat last year questioned the legality of the adoptions Petersen administered.\n\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands is located near the equator in the Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and the Philippines. It has a population of about 53,000 people. Petersen, who is member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, served his church mission there, according to court documents.\n\nThe Arizona charges against Petersen\n\nThe Arizona Attorney General's Office investigation focused on Medicaid fraud. The indictment alleges Petersen illegally obtained medical services for the women, falsely claiming the women were Arizona residents.\n\nMilstead said DPS began investigating Petersen's adoption practices in December after a state trooper was tipped off by a friend who considered adopting through Petersen's office but was concerned about the legitimacy of the adoption process.\n\nThe Arizona case involves actions dating to November 2015, but according to court records, Petersen has arranged Marshallese adoptions since 2005.\n\nMilstead said he expects the DPS to recommend other charges to the Attorney General's Office.\n\nAccording to court records, the 28 pregnant women identified by Arizona investigators followed a similar adoption pattern:\n\nPetersen paid individuals in the Marshall Islands to help locate pregnant women interested in adoption. He then matched them with adoptive families in the U.S.\n\nPetersen paid the pregnant women $1,000 per month while they were pregnant in the U.S. and covered other expenses. Some birth mothers were promised up to $10,000 to place their unborn child for adoption.\n\nHe charged the adoptive families about $35,000 per adoption, claiming this included the birth mother's medical costs.\n\nPetersen sent money to the pregnant women in the Marshall Islands to purchase passports.\n\nPetersen paid for the women to fly to Phoenix and stay in a house he owns for the duration of their pregnancy. In some instances, the women gave birth within days of arriving in Arizona. In other cases, they were in the state as long as six months.\n\nShortly before the women gave birth, Petersen or his associates assisted her in signing up for Medicaid benefits, falsely stating they were Arizona residents.\n\nAfter the women gave birth and the adoption was complete, Petersen paid for them to fly back to the Marshall Islands or to other states \u2013 most often Arkansas.\n\nPetersen is accused of bilking the state out of more than $800,000, the Arizona Attorney General's Office said Wednesday.\n\nBrnovich said the Arizona investigation focuses solely on the alleged fraud to the state's Medicaid system and stressed that his office was not pursuing families who adopted children through Petersen's law office.\n\n\"It's unfair to the adoptive parents, and it's also unfair to the hard-working Arizona taxpayers,\" he said.\n\nAccording to his website, Petersen charges $40,000 per adoption.\n\nPetersen also serves as general counsel for Bright Star Adoptions, an agency that operates out of the same building as his law office, according to his website.\n\nLinda Henning Gansler is listed on the website as the director of Bright Star Adoptions. A woman who identified herself as \"Linda\" answered the agency's phone Wednesday but would not comment on the agency's relationship with Petersen.\n\nAfter Petersen was arrested, prosecutors were concerned about a flight risk. Petersen's cash bond was set at $500,000 in his initial court appearance Tuesday night.\n\nHe was asked to surrender his passport at his next court appearance, which was scheduled for Oct. 15.\n\nAn attorney for Petersen did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nUtah case: 'The commercialization of children'\n\nThe Utah attorney general alleged that Petersen recruited more than 40 pregnant women from the Marshall Islands over the past three years and transported them to Utah, where they were paid to give up their children for adoption in the U.S.\n\nPetersen is facing 11 felony charges in Utah.\n\nThe state\u2019s investigation centered on claims of human smuggling, Sean Reyes, Utah\u2019s attorney general, said during a news conference Wednesday.\n\n\"The commercialization of children is illegal and the commoditization of children is simply evil,\" he said.\n\nLeo Lucy, chief investigator with the Utah attorney general\u2019s office, called Petersen\u2019s operation a \u201clarge-scale adoption fraud scheme.\u201d\n\nAdoption scam:'They take your money ... dreams and hopes'\n\nBetween December 2016 and September 2018, a little more than $2.7 million was deposited into a bank account Petersen gave adoptive families for wire transfers, according to Utah court documents. Most of the transfers included notes indicating they were payments for adoptions.\n\nProsecutors in Utah are not questioning completed adoptions, Reyes said. His office does not anticipate any overturned adoptions as a result of the case.\n\n\u201cWe have no interest ... in interfering in any adoptions that have taken place,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, investigators noted that some adoptions through Petersen\u2019s firm are still pending and people involved in those adoptions are \u201cvery concerned.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how Utah state agencies will handle the pending adoption cases.\n\nArkansas U.S. Attorney: A scheme to make quick money\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Arkansas detailed the activities of Petersen and his co-defendant there, Maki Takehisa. Authorities characterized their operation as a scheme to defraud and take advantage of Marshallese women and families to make quick money.\n\nThe indictment says Petersen would offer to pay up to $10,000 to pregnant Marshallese women to travel to the U.S. to give birth to their babies and give them up for adoption.\n\n\u201cSince 2014, he (Petersen) used his law license and expertise to prey not only on the women of the Marshall Islands but on the families of Arkansas who wanted nothing more than to add to their families,\u201d said Duane Kees, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas, at a news conference in Springdale, Arkansas, which was streamed online.\n\nTakehisa is a citizen of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.\n\nAccording to federal court documents, Petersen and Takehisa had offered to pay at least four Marshallese women to give up their babies for adoption in Arkansas.\n\nThe 19-count indictment filed in U.S. District Court in the Western District of Arkansas charges Petersen and Takehisa with conspiracy to smuggle the women for private financial gain; aiding and abetting the smuggling; wire fraud; mail fraud; conspiracy to commit visa fraud; and conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\nKees said at the news conference that at this point, there\u2019s no evidence the women are seeking to be reunited with the babies. He said the women were not told to get pregnant. They were approached after they were pregnant, he said.\n\nKees said the women described \u201cthese ordeals as being treated as property.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake no mistake,\u201d he said, \u201cthis is the purest form of human trafficking.\u201d\n\nKees estimated between 30 and 35 adoptions a year were conducted under fraudulent circumstances.\n\nIf Petersen is found guilty of all the federal charges in Arkansas, he could be sentenced up to 315 years in prison and be imposed a $5 million fine, Kees said.\n\nFollow Jessica Boehm on Twitter @jboehm_NEWS.", "description": "Maricopa County Assessor Paul Petersen arranged for 28 pregnant women from the Marshall Islands to travel to Arizona, the state Attorney General said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/09/PPHX/9d14d141-462c-44ab-b50b-e73db8546e0f-Paul_Peterson.jpg?crop=375,500,x25,y0&width=375&height=468&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
