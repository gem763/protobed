Hatches along the submerged boat\u2019s spine opened, flooding the capacious tubes beneath. Moments later, an undersea volcano seemingly erupted from the depths.\n\nAmidst roiling smoke, four stubby-looking missiles measuring twelve-meters in length emerged one by one. Momentarily, they seemed on the verge of faltering backward into the sea before their solid-fuel rockets ignited, propelling them high into the stratosphere. The four missiles soared across Russia to land in a missile test range on the Kamchatka peninsula, roughly 3,500 miles away.\n\nYou can see the launch sequence in this video.\n\nLike the nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) operated by United States, China, France, the United Kingdom, and India, the primary purpose of Borei-class submarines is almost unimaginably grim: to bring ruin to an adversary\u2019s cities, even should other nuclear forces be wiped out in a first strike.\n\nEach of the submarine\u2019s sixteen R-30 Bulava (\u201cMace\u201d) missiles typically carries six 150-kiloton nuclear warheads designed to split apart to hit separate targets. This means one Borei can rain seventy-two nuclear warheads ten times more destructive than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima on cities and military bases over 5,800 miles away.\n\nThe Borei is the most advanced SSBN in the Russian Navy, and is designed to replace its seven Soviet-era Delta-class SSBNs. Throughout most of the Cold War, Soviets submarines were noisier than their Western counterparts, and thus vulnerable to detection and attack by Western attack submarines.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "If you can't beat them, destroy them.", "authors": ["Sebastien Roblin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UD8rm7su1pccq6CHWDkwWw--~B/aD05MDM7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/9443865ad7aa8e6a767e9165c6a1d53e", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
