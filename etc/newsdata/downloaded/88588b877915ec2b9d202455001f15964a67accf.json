Now his nomination is a crapshoot after flubs on the campaign trail, poor debate performances and the big surge by Elizabeth Warren.\n\n\u201cBig money people who might favor Biden are investors; not gamblers or zealots so the money is drying up,\u201d Bannon concluded.\n\nWarren and Sanders have both gobbled up small-dollar donors at a rate the Biden camp hasn\u2019t been able to contend with, putting more pressure on the former vice president\u2019s campaign to win support from big donors.\n\n\u201cA candidate like Sanders can lag in the polls and still raise a lot of money because he has a large number of fervent and committed followers who will keep on giving hell and high water,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cBiden doesn\u2019t have that kind of donor base.\u201d\n\nBiden has sought to bolster his campaign, partly by using the attacks from Trump as an argument for people to support his campaign.\n\n\u201cThe real story of the attacks on Joe Biden is that every Democrat is going to be victimized the same way,\u201d said Robert Zimmerman, a longtime Democratic donor who said he will be sending Biden a donation in response to the Trump attacks.\n\n\u201cI, for one, will be sending a donation out of respect for him personally because we cannot let any of our candidates be slandered this way,\u201d Zimmerman said.\n\nOne longtime Democratic bundler \u2014who has not committed to a campaign\u2014 agreed that there was concern about Biden\u2019s campaign particularly with Warren gaining momentum in recent weeks and overtaking him in polls. But the bundler also said Biden\u2019s recent numbers are good enough to keep him competitive.\n\n\u201cHe has never been viewed as a prolific fundraiser and hasn\u2019t raised [money] in over a decade, unlike most of the candidates who have had an election,\u201d the bundler said, adding that in general Biden has had \u201cstrong\u201d back-to-back quarters.\n\n\u201cFive million keeps you going for this quarter, 10 million allows you to get ready for Iowa and New Hampshire and over 15 [million] allows you to start playing in Super Tuesday [states],\u201d the bundler said.\n\nBut other donors aren\u2019t entirely convinced.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just not where they should be,\u201d the first donor said.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign met with top fundraisers and donors over the weekend to brief them on strategy over PowerPoint presentations that \u201cplotted the path forward for the former vice president,\u201d according to The New York Times.\n\nDenise Bauer, a donor and the former ambassador to Belgium, said it was a pivotal moment. \u201cWe need him to get the nomination because he\u2019s the one who can win,\u201d Bauer told the Times. \u201cWe are all going to try to raise every single dollar we can.\u201d\n\nOne donor told The Hill that some are holding off giving to Biden because they need to see reason to have more confidence in his campaign.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s why so many people are still in wait-and-see mode,\u201d the donor said.", "description": "Democratic donors are increasingly expressing frustration with Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign, saying he\u2019s failed to make a clear rational for why he\u2019s running for the White House.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/bidenjoe_100419getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
