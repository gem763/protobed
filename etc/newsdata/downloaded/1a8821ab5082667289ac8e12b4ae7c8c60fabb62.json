A president should unite us and inspire us to follow \u201cour better angels.\u201d A president should demonstrate the essential qualities of honesty and integrity, and elevate the national discourse with comity and mutual respect. As a nation, we have been blessed with presidents who have called on the greatness of the American spirit. With the nation so divided, resentful and angry, presidential leadership in qualities of character is indispensable. And it is in this province where the incumbent\u2019s shortfall has been most glaring.\n\nDemocrats and some pundits sniffed that Romney was just another Jeff Flake, all bark and no bite. Republicans derided the decision to call Trump out, with many of them attacking Romney in response\u2014including his own niece, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, who called his criticism \u201cdisappointing and unproductive.\u201d\n\nThe backlash to the op-ed was a crash course in \u201cdamned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t.\u201d But if you look closely, you can see that Romney was laying the groundwork for an eventual challenge to Trump. He was getting into position to get into position.\n\nThat said, he didn\u2019t mobilize over the Mueller report, saying only that he was \u201csickened\u201d by what the special counsel uncovered. Romney\u2019s relatively low profile and mere brow furrowing exasperated Democrats and worried apostate Republicans (like me), who held out hope that Romney might become a Goldwater-like figure in the Senate: a former presidential nominee with the clout to exact some accountability from his party\u2019s president.\n\nRead: Mitt Romney is not joining the resistance\n\nNow it looks like Romney was playing the long game, waiting for a moment when there might be leverage for him not simply to annoy Trump, but to be in the jury box rendering a verdict on his presidency. Which is exactly where the whistle-blower report about Trump and his dealings with Ukraine may put him. Suddenly we\u2019ve gone from an environment where impeachment couldn\u2019t even clear the House Democratic caucus to one where polling support for impeachment and removal is above 50 percent, and rising.\n\nRomney has not rushed to get ahead of the process. Instead, he\u2019s engaged with characteristic caution. At first, he called the allegations \u201ctroubling in the extreme.\u201d When the readout of Trump\u2019s call with President Volodymyr Zelensky and the whistle-blower complaint became public, providing clearer evidence that the president had courted foreign interference in the coming election, and seemingly pressured a vulnerable ally to do the interfering, Romney stepped up his criticism, calling it \u201cwrong and appalling.\u201d", "description": "The senator can pry the Republican Party from President Trump\u2019s hands.", "authors": ["Sarah Longwell", "Executive Director Of Republicans For The Rule Of Law"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTX6UX98/facebook.jpg?1571774376", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
