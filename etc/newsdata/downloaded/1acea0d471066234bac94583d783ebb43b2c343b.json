And my numbers went down to the equivalent of a normal human being who does not have pancreatic cancer. So we were all very optimistic. And they said, 'Good, we're gonna stop chemo, we'll start you on immunotherapy,'\" he said before, \"I lost about 12 pounds in a week. And my numbers went sky high, much higher than they were when I was first diagnosed. So, the doctors have decided that I have to undergo chemo again and that's what I'm doing.\"\n\nTrebek talked about how cancer has taken a toll on his body saying sometimes it\u2019s \u201cexcruciating pain\u201d and other times \u201cfatigue.\u201d\n\n\u201cCancer is mysterious in more ways than one,\u201d he said.\n\nThe game show host also revealed his battle with depression that started when he was first diagnosed saying that sometimes he feels a \u201csurge of sadness\u201d and \u201cdepression.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it happened early on I was down on myself,\u201d he told \u201cGMA.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how fallible each of us is in his or her own way \u2026 I talk to the audience sometimes and I get teary eyed for no reason.

He said he keeps these materials backstage on display.\n\nWhen asked if he started to think differently about life, the \u201cJeopardy!\u201d host said the thought of passing on doesn't frighten him.\n\n\"I realize that there is an end in sight for me, just as there is for everyone else. One line that I have used with our staff in recent weeks and months is that when I do pass on, one thing they will not say at my funeral is, 'Oh, he was taken from us too soon.'\" Trebek said. \"Hey guys. I\u2019m 79-years-old. I\u2019ve had one hell of a good life. And I\u2019ve enjoyed it \u2026 the thought of passing on doesn't frighten me, it doesn't. Other things do, the affect it will have on my loved ones ... it makes me sad. But the thought of myself moving on, hey folks, it comes with the territory.\u201d\n\nWith all that said, Trebek said he has no plans to stop hosting \"Jeopardy!\"\n\n\"As long as I can walk out and greet the audience and the contestants and run the game I'm happy,\" he said.", "description": "\u201cJeopardy!\u201d host Alex Trebek announced Tuesday that he is undergoing chemotherapy again.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/alex-trebek1-abc-ml-190501_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
