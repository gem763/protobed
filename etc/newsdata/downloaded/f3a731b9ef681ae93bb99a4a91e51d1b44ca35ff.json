She \u201cwould have loved to have\u201d a history of the black-girl afro when she was younger, she says: the 25-year-old\u2019s book will explore the personal and political histories of the hairstyle, as part of a groundbreaking new series by young people about the history of black Britain.\n\n\u201cMyself and almost everyone I know has had their own personal journey relating to afro hair. It\u2019s not just hair \u2013 it can be political, it can be a statement, so many things,\u201d says Kwaw-Swanzy, a founding member of award-winning magazine gal-dem. \u201cThere was a time when lots of products weren\u2019t available and there wasn\u2019t a lot of education out there about how to manage this hair best, because it\u2019s not the norm in our country. So to have a book that explains why it is important would have probably helped me learn to love my own hair a lot quicker than I did.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018It\u2019s not just hair, it can be political\u2019 ...

Photograph: Feruza Afewerki\n\nKwaw-Swanzy\u2019s is one book in A Quick Ting On, a groundbreaking new non-fiction series focused on the black British community, all written by young black British writers. Created by 24-year-old publisher Magdalene Abraha, the series is the first of its kind and will cover topics from grime music to bamboo earrings, plantain to the black British power movement, Afrobeats to black British business.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like this out there \u2013 that\u2019s one of the reasons why I had to do it,\u201d says Abraha. \u201cI created this series to provide a space that can celebrate, pay homage and explore culture. It\u2019s about the everyday conversations that we have about art, music, hair, history, politics, food and so much more.\u201d\n\nEveryone she approached \u2013 often by WhatsApp \u2013 to write for A Quick Ting On is making their publishing debut. All are under 30, and Abraha describes them as a collective.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re embarking on this writing journey together, learning to do it together in the form of a series, which I think is really powerful,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was really important to me to launch it with young, passionate, debut black writers, and to work on developing them.\u201d\n\nChristian Adofo, 29, is writing A Quick Ting On Afrobeats, and believes the series will be \u201ca seed that allows us to represent ourselves unapologetically \u2026 Growing up in the UK while having roots in Africa and the Caribbean is a nuanced and ever-shifting experience, especially as you reach the age at which your parents migrated here and you begin to emphasise the sacrifice and foresight for your own future,\u201d he says. \u201cI want readers to acknowledge the influence of the transatlantic slave trade that follows a similar route to the music. This constant feedback between Africa, the Caribbean and the west is rich, which effortlessly influences popular culture.\u201d\n\nSophia Tassew, who is writing A Quick Ting On Bamboo Earrings, says: \u201cI feel like this book is not only a win for me but a win for young women who also grew up in a similar environment. This book is a love letter to the women that have raised me, along with a nod to my culture.\u201d Her book will explore how bamboo earrings have been \u201ca point of identity for many black and Latina women but \u2026 shunned by the mainstream fashion industry\u201d until recently.\n\nKwaw-Swanzy says she loves that the series could help readers outside black British communities understand the importance of their culture.\n\n\u201cBlack history tends to be focused around slavery \u2013 which was such a big part \u2013 but to be able to say there are so many other things that are important to this culture and this country, that\u2019s something I would have loved to know more about in school. It wasn\u2019t until I got to uni\u2019 that I started to find myself. It would be great if some of this stuff was covered earlier,\u201d she adds.\n\nA Quick Ting On will be published by Jacaranda Books, the award-winning independent publisher dedicated to diverse books, in October 2020, with new titles to come out over the following year. Other writers set to contribute include Chant\u00e9 Joseph, 22, Tobi Kyeremateng, 24, Rui Da Silva, 25, Tskenya-Sarah Frazer, 25, and Franklyn Addo, 26.\n\n\u201cWriting a book is something I never considered I\u2019d be capable of, but it\u2019s really exciting to be a part of a series that feels relevant and integral to archiving black Britishness,\u201d says Kyeremateng, who will be writing A Quick Ting On Theatre Sh*t, named for Arinz\u00e9 Kene\u2019s play Misty. \u201cIt\u2019s important to open up the conversation around what we think theatre is and how contemporary black British theatre smashes these traditional western ideals.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole point of the series is that the subjects are limitless, it can last forever,\u201d says Abraha. \u201cThere are never going to be too many topics to cover.\u201d\n\n\u2022 A Quick Ting On will launch in October 2020.", "description": "A groundbreaking new black British history series will explore subjects from Afrobeats to the power movement.
