I think that could lead to a decision by the U.S. administration to not put forth a tariff rate hike on Oct. 15.\" (Reporting by David Lawder; Editing by Hugh Lawson)", "description": "Top U.S. and Chinese negotiators are working towards an \"early harvest\" of confidence-building agreements that could forestall further U.S. tariffs, including an agreement to avoid currency manipulation, a senior U.S. Chamber of Commerce official said on Thursday.
