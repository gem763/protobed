Make it a slog", "language": "en", "text": "The fight is a risky one for Democrats, who are well aware that getting caught in a protracted courtroom slog could cost them a chance to pounce while the president is on the defensive, facing sagging poll numbers and near-peak public focus on a budding scandal over his efforts to pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason in this case Congress has to go down that path at all,\u201d said Phil Barnett, who served for more than a decade as a top aide to Democratic oversight heavyweight Rep. Henry Waxman and is currently informally advising party leadership on its efforts. \u201cThey know the key facts already, so this is like trying to close the barn door after the horse has already left.\u201d\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/76/1d/89d23a804d4d95f3083b6e9593d4/trumpimpeachment.jpg\"\n\nDemocrats recognize that the approach might lead them into yet another quagmire. Trump\u2019s team has already successfully slow walked the release of dishy details at the center of Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe, as well as the president\u2019s tax returns, turning once hot-button issues into protracted, arcane legal fights.\n\n\u201cWe're not fooling around here,\u201d House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who has become Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s new point man on impeachment, told reporters Wednesday at the Capitol. \u201cWe don\u2019t want this to drag on months and months and months, which appears to be the administration's strategy.\u201d\n\nStill, for now, Democrats are choosing to pursue more evidence instead of just moving forward with the already-available facts. And if they do get bogged down, the backup plan is to simply add the Trump allies\u2019 legal tactics to the articles of impeachment.\n\n\u201cThey will be strengthening the case on obstruction if they behave that way,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nThe approach has opened up several potential battlefronts in the fight to uncover more information about a July phone call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Trump\u2019s allies have claimed that Biden made the move to quash an investigation into work that his son, Hunter Biden, did with a Ukrainian gas company, although no evidence has emerged of any wrongdoing. Trump also asked Zelensky for an investigation into unfounded allegations that Ukrainian officials attempted to help Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee has said it will subpoena the White House on Friday for documents connected to the incident.\n\nThe Democrats are also trying to obtain documents from Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer who has spent months trying to convince Ukraine to launch investigations into Biden and his son. The pugnacious former New York mayor himself lawyered up after getting a subpoena Monday from three House committees demanding materials about his communications with Ukrainian officials.\n\nA similar fight is taking place over Democratic attempts to subpoena materials from the State Department and specifically from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who on Wednesday confirmed he was on the Trump-Zelensky call. Lawmakers also have been trying to arrange sit-down depositions with five current and former State employees. The first one of these interviews is set for Thursday, when Kurt Volker, the recently departed special envoy for Ukraine, will meet with congressional aides.\n\nIn each instance, Trump officials and allies have responded with legal arguments aimed at preemptively blocking the overtures.\n\nIn an interview Wednesday night, Giuliani said that \u201cin order to obey\u201d the subpoenas, \u201cI\u2019d have to violate attorney-client privilege.\u201d Therefore, he added, disputing the subpoenas \u201cwould be taking the high road.\u201d\n\nGiuliani on Tuesday also suggested he plans to sue Congress and \u201cthe swamp\u201d in retribution for the impeachment inquiry \u2014 a tactic Trump lawyers have also used at the federal and state level to halt the release of his tax returns. Wednesday night, Giuliani added that if Democrats hold him in contempt for refusing to comply with the subpoenas, \u201cthey would just be making my lawsuit better.\u201d\n\nPompeo in a letter on Tuesday argued that the demands conflicted with the department\u2019s \u201cinterest in safeguarding potentially privileged and classified information.\u201d He also slammed Democrats for having \u201cno legal basis for such a threat\u201d about obstruction.\n\n\u201cI urge you to exercise restraint in making such unfounded statements in the future,\u201d he said.\n\nFor their part, the White House called the subpoenas a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d effort.\n\n\u201cThis is nothing but more document requests, wasted time and taxpayer dollars that will ultimately show the President did nothing wrong,\u201d said White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham.\n\nIn his own hyperbolic manner, Trump himself has vaguely alleged that the Democrats\u2019 attempts to publicize the incident and gather information about it is illegal, claiming that Schiff should be prosecuted for treason over his description of Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky.\n\nWhile the president\u2019s lawyers haven\u2019t used such colorful language, they too are signaling they have shifted into war footing and hope to draw Democrats into court.\n\n\u201cThere are significant constitutional issues raised by the subpoenas,\u201d said Jay Sekulow, one of the lead members of the president\u2019s personal legal team in a text message. He added that the subpoena demands will be \u201cresponded to appropriately\u201d and struck back at the Democratic allegations that a refusal to comply constitutes obstruction.\n\n\u201cArguing that following constitutional mandates is obstruction is absurd. Read Article 2,\u201d Sekulow said.\n\nLegal experts say these tactics shouldn\u2019t rattle Democrats. They argue that Pelosi likely holds the winning hand in court if she wants to try and challenge the Trump team\u2019s specific defenses.\n\nGiuliani, for example, may have undercut his own claims in public, according to several legal analysts. He\u2019s claimed that he works for Trump in other capacities, beyond just being his lawyer, which could undercut his attorney-client privilege argument. And it\u2019s unlikely that all of his outreach to Ukrainian officials is legally protected. Then there are Giuliani\u2019s ubiquitous media appearances.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s yakking all the time. Assuming he\u2019s been doing his yakking with the permission of the president, that\u2019s very likely constitutes a waiver to some , if not all of it,\u201d said Frank Bowman, a University of Missouri law professor.\n\nBut Bowman, the author of the new book \u201cHigh Crimes and Misdemeanors,\u201d said Democrats who are intent on capturing all of the current focus on impeachment may not want to go down the litigation path \u2014 even if they know they\u2019d win.\n\n\u201cThe trouble is if you want to get information out of Giuliani you\u2019re going to have to get it one axe fight at a time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely to be a blanket rule on him. As an investigator, you\u2019ve got to work fact by fact, communication by communication, observation by observation and fight it out that way, which is obviously a long and tedious process.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the message that Pelosi and her deputies are hearing from Democratic veterans and advisers like Barnett, the former Waxman aide. Barnett is informally advising Democratic leaders on the subject with his longtime partner, Phil Schiliro, a former Obama White House legislative director.\n\nCalling out Pompeo specifically, Barnett said the secretary of State has no legal ability to block his employees from giving testimony to lawmakers. He cited a 1912 law \u2014 the Lloyd-La Follette Act \u2014 that gives civil servants the ability to furnish information to Congress, as well as any U.S. citizen\u2019s fundamental First Amendment protections. \u201cNot only is it obstructing the investigation, it\u2019s directly contrary to federal law on something that he\u2019s personally implicated in,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother area where Democrats will be battling Trump is over access to classified materials.\n\nWhile the White House last week surprised many lawmakers by clearing the release of a summary transcript of the president\u2019s call with Zelensky, they may not be so forthcoming in the future. Pompeo\u2019s letter on Tuesday cited classified information as one reason he could not fulfill Democrats\u2019 demands.\n\nLegal experts said Democrats may need to find workarounds to avoid doing battle with the administration\u2019s law enforcement and intelligence arms over the topic.\n\n\u201cThe House could deliver articles of impeachment to the Senate having had some evidence presented in a classified setting, and classifying some of the final report as a result,\u201d said Greg Brower, who served as the FBI\u2019s top liaison to Congress until 2018.\n\nBut once the impeachment process moves to the Senate \u2014 where Trump would essentially be defending himself in a courtroom setting with 100 jurors and both sides allowed to present their cases publicly \u2014 keeping some information private becomes more difficult.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d have an open trial in which some of the evidence is classified,\u201d Brower said. \u201cI could see the administration crying afoul and accusing lawmakers of doing some kind of secret proceeding.\u201d\n\nStill, Mieke Eoyang, the Vice President for Third Way's National Security Program and a former staff director on the House Intelligence Committee, noted that Congress isn\u2019t legally bound by the president\u2019s classification scheme and can technically put almost anything into the legislative record.\n\nThe executive branch \u201ccannot bind the legislative branch,\u201d Eoyang said. \u201cCongress only respects it as a matter of courtesy and principle.\u201d\n\nNatasha Bertrand and Matthew Choi contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/13/6f/8dc2cd204d3083ad81489a62c1cd/191002-trump-impeachment-getty-773.jpg"}
