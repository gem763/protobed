Australian stockbroker Morgans picks up CBA's CommSec advisory unit\n\nSept 23 (Reuters) - Australian stockbroker Morgans on Monday said it would take over the advisory business of Commonwealth Bank of Australia's online stockbroking firm, CommSec, for an undisclosed sum.\n\nThe deal, described as a \"transition\" by the Brisbane-based firm, comes as CBA and its large banking rivals are divesting their advisory businesses following a national inquiry that exposed widespread misconduct in those units.\n\n\"CommSec's advisory business will transition to Morgans,\" the Brisbane-based stockbroker said in a statement. Both CommSec and Morgans declined to put a value on the deal.\n\nThe Australian Financial Review reported on Monday that CommSec's advisory arm consisted of \"about a dozen\" advisers who advise clients on assets worth up to A$4.5 billion ($3.05 billion).\n\nThe deal comes following a tender conducted by CBA, the newspaper added. The bank in June said it had agreed to sell its advisory firm Count Financial Ltd for A$2.5 million and would continue its exit from its other advisory and broking units.\n\nNational Australia Bank has also decided to offload its pension and advisory unit, MLC, while Australia and New Zealand Banking Group has agreed to sell its advisory business to IOOF .
