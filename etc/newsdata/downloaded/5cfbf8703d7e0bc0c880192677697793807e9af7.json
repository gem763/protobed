However, whilst it is vital to remove these impurities to prevent blackheads, breakouts and normalise skin function, it is important not to strip the skin of its natural oils and impair 'barrier function\u2019.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\n\"This is crucial, as the skin barrier works as a protector by stopping outside microbes from permeating the skin and also keeps the skin moist by preventing evaporation.\n\nHow should we do it and why?\n\nPaul explains: \u201cIn today's world of time-pressure and rushing around, many skin authorities recommend cleansing just at night, but the key is a double cleanse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s essential to use daily sunscreen, but this means it is important to remove this and any makeup every night and therefore cleansing twice is recommended.\n\n\u201cThere are some companies that also formulate cleansing oils to help remove stubborn makeup too. The act of washing and massaging in a cleanser to the skin also stimulates blood flow and acts as a minor form of lymphatic drainage - both help the skin to look fresher and brighter.\u201d\n\n(Image: Paul Banwell)\n\nWhat are the mistakes that people make when it comes to cleansing?\n\nPaul advises: \u201cFirstly - avoid alcohol based astringent cleansers. They dry the face and strip natural lipids from the skin. For this reason, also avoid face wipes!\n\n\u201cApart from the ecological issues and saving the planet, they are usually full of alcohol, fragrance and other synthetics compounds which can irritate the skin and in turn lead to sensitivity and redness. Save them for last resort scenarios.\u201d\n\nHow can over-cleansing damage your skin and do more harm than good?\n\nPaul says: \u201cFor the reasons mentioned above, using the wrong cleanser can affect the barrier function of the skin and lead to further problems such as breakouts, redness and sensitivity - the very things good cleansers can resolve. Choose carefully.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nAny product recommendations that you might have?\n\nPaul says: \u201cThe big buzz word in cleansing at the moment is ceramides. These help keep the skin soft, optimise immune function and help maintain good barrier function. Look for cleansers with ceramics.\n\n\u201cMy favourite and top recommendation by far is the Rationale Proceramide Cleanser, which provides the skin with nourishing lipids, as well as powerful antioxidants, Australian solar repair botanicals and ceramides which replenishes the skin's intercellular lipids - this one is a firm favourite with celebrities and models.\n\n\u201cFor general skin health and reduction of fine lines and wrinkles, I'd recommend Skinned. Skinade is the leading liquid collagen drink which contains a number of co-factors and nutrients that will improve skin elasticity and the density of the collagen structure in the skin.\n\n\u201cRationale Skin Care also offer a fantastic Catalyst Cleanser which contains alpha and beta hydroxyacids - perfect if you are prone to teenage or adult breakouts.\n\n\u201cOther recommendations would include a Cleansing Cream from Codage Paris. This is a gentle and nourishing cleanser and is perfect for sensitive skins too.\n\n\u201cThere is also some evidence that Micellar Water offers a gentle form of cleansing - try Codage Micellar Water. Note - Kim Kardashian is a big fan of Codage products!\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Everyone washes their face to get rid of makeup, grease, sweat and pollutant, but skin expert Paul Banwell explains why we have to be careful", "authors": ["Poppy Danby", "Image", "Blend Images", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Paul Banwell", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12051085.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/482143017.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
