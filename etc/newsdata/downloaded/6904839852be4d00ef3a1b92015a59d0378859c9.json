High School, set the national record for most career goals scored by a high school girls soccer player when she connected for her third goal less than 12 minutes into Tuesday night's game at Gananda (N.Y.) High School.\n\n\"My sister (Abigail Marotta,) got the ball and looked up and found me, she played a perfect ball and I ran onto it, controlled it and put it into the back of the net,\" DeLyser said. \"She came up and was like 'I assisted that' and I said, 'Yeah, you did.'\n\n\"It felt really good and all the pressure is off. It means a lot, I worked really hard for this since I was 6, so just showing it's all paid off. I got to do it with my best friends and family. I was relieved, just another goal.\"\n\nWell, not really. It was her 317th goal and broke the record set by Esmeralda Gonzales of South Hills High School in Fort Worth, Texas, from 2013-16.\n\nHistory.

The Black Knights are 14-1 on the season.\n\nDeLyser, who has been a member of the Marion varsity team since seventh grade, now has 319 goals and 164 assists in her six seasons.\n\n\"It was a very stressful day overall, I didn't talk to her about any of it (and) even hid the newspaper,\" Chloe's mother Heather said. \"So, we had our normal routine and I said good luck when she left.\n\nMarion's Chloe DeLyser, right, celebrates with Scarlett Keppen after DeLyser scored her record-breaking 317th career goal during a regular season game against Gananda at Gananda High School, Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2019.

It was a relief because now she can just enjoy the rest of the season and move on to try to win states. The whole thing is unbelievable because that kid has worked so hard since she was 6. She has given up birthday parties, school trips, to do this. She travels all the time and puts in so many hours. I just want to tell everybody.\"\n\nDeLyser opened the scoring on a breakaway just 1:26 into the game and tied Gonzales by finishing from in close with 36:41 left in the half.\n\nThe record came just over eight and a half minutes later as DeLyser settled a ball near the top of the box, dribbled twice and her right-footed shot deflected off of the Gananda keeper and into the top right side of the net for No. 317.\n\nDeLyser added another goal and an assist in the first half as the Black Knights built a 6-0 lead. She added another goal with 25 minutes left in the game.\n\nThe Ohio State commit and reigning All-Greater Rochester Player of the Year has 55 goals and 20 assists with one game remaining in the regular season.\n\nFollow the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle's Zachary Memmott on Twitter @ZacharyMemmott.", "description": "Chloe DeLyser, an Ohio State commit, scored her 317th goal Tuesday night, setting a new national record for a high school girls soccer player.", "authors": ["Zachary Memmott", "Published A.M.
