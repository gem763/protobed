Can you tell the difference?\n\n\n\nFollowers certainly had a hard time doing so.\n\n\n\n\"You recreated her whole face though,\" one user commented.\n\nWhile another asked, \"Isn\u2019t that Kim?\"\n\nBeing a celebrity lookalike has several benefits, like gaining additional followers on Instagram. But Fyzia (27) and Sonia aren\u2019t so pleased about being Kardashian doppelgangers.\n\n\"We always get told we're Kardashian wannabes, but this is how we\u2019ve always looked,\" Fyzia said in an interview with Refinery in 2017.\n\n\n\n\"Last year we were even contacted by the Kardashians a number of times for the 'look-alikes' episode of the show, but we said no.\"\n\nSonia added that growing up in the Middle East \"every single woman has a Kardashian look\".\n\n\"It's very common.\"\n\n\n\nEven though they find the comparisons irritating, the sisters agree that resembling one of the most famous families in the world has helped further their careers.\n\n\"I like the Kardashians for bringing out this look,\" Fyzia says. \"Before, we were always ignored by brands and companies because we didn't have that 'English look' with rosy cheeks or blonde hair and blue eyes.\"\n\n(Sources: Refinery, Instagram, The Sun)", "description": "Scroll through their joint Instagram account and you\u2019re bound to do a few double takes.", "authors": ["Lesego Mkhize"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9469/62820868cdad49eba272a0c53a37d03b.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
