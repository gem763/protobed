He starts working as head of the personal staff of the prime minister, Georges Pompidou, and earns the nickname 'the bulldozer'. Chirac serves his first term as prime minister.\n\nChirac takes on the role of mayor of Paris, which he holds for 18 years, enabling him to build a significant political power base. Chirac becomes prime minister for a second time. Chirac succeeds Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand as president of France. It marks the end of 14 years of Socialist party rule. As president, Chirac acknowledges France's role in the Holocaust: 'Yes, the criminal folly of the occupiers was seconded by the French, by the French state. France, the land of the enlightenment and human rights ... delivered those it protects to their executioners.' Implicated in a corruption case related to his time as mayor of Paris, Chirac is granted immunity from prosecution. Chirac wins a second term as president with 82% of the vote, as all of the major parties swing to support him in the runoff against the far-right Front National's Jean-Marie Le Pen. Chirac's opposition to the Iraq war bolsters his popularity at home, while straining France's relationship with the US and its allies in the operation. It also leads to french fries being re-dubbed 'freedom fries' in Congressional cafeterias. Chirac's campaign for the proposed European constitution in a referendum is rejected by 55% of French voters. The president is forced to declare a state of emergency as rioting sweeps across France. He later announces he will not stand for a third term. Chirac is succeeded as president by Nicolas Sarkozy. With his immunity expired, Chirac is found guilty of diverting public funds and abusing public confidence while mayor of Paris, and is given a two-year suspended prison sentence. Due to ill health he does not attend the trial. Chirac dies 'peacefully, among his loved ones', aged 86.\n\nAfter a mass attended by about 200 family and friends at the H\u00f4tel des Invalides, the current president, Emmanuel Macron, led a military tribute. Later on Monday a funeral will be held at the church of Saint-Sulpice before Chirac is buried with full military honours at the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the capital.\n\nMacron entered Les Invalides at 10.45am to review French troops as the Marseillaise was played. To a solemn drumbeat, Chirac\u2019s coffin, draped in a tricolour, was brought into the cour d\u2019honneur and placed on the ground.\n\nThe atmosphere was sombre and silent. Several military veterans present could be seen wiping their eyes as the funeral march was played.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The hearse transporting Jacques Chirac\u2019s coffin leaves the H\u00f4tel des Invalides for the church of Saint-Sulpice in Paris for his funeral service.

His death prompted a flood of tributes to the man whose political career spanned more than four decades and who was seen as one of France\u2019s last great statespeople.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The former US president Bill Clinton arriving at Saint-Sulpice for the funeral of Jacques Chirac.

The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, and the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, were also due to attend, as were former leaders who worked with Chirac, including Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European commission, the former German chancellor Gerard Schr\u00f6der and the former US president Bill Clinton.\n\nFrench politicians will turn out en masse, including three former presidents \u2013 93-year-old Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing, Chirac\u2019s successor, Nicolas Sarkozy, and the former Socialist president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.\n\nBefore the military ceremony, Chirac\u2019s widow, Bernadette, 86, attended a private mass at the Saint-Louis-des-Invalides cathedral. The couple were married for 63 years and had two daughters, Laurence, who died in 2016, and Claude.\n\nChirac will be buried next to his elder daughter, who had anorexia for most of her adult life and died at the age of 58.\n\nChirac\u2019s only grandchild, Martin Chirac-Rey, 23, addressed about 200 family and friends after the private service.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jacques Chirac\u2019s daughter Claude, flanked by her husband Frederic Salat-Baroux (R) and her son Martin Rey Chirac at the memorial service at Saint-Sulpice.

A minute\u2019s silence was observed in public institutions and schools.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chirac\u2019s successor, Nicolas Sarkozy (R), arrives at Saint-Sulpice with his wife, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, for the funeral.

It is the site of museums and monuments to France\u2019s military history and contains the tombs of its war heroes, including Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Members of the public queued on Sunday to say farewell to Chirac as his coffin lay in state at the Saint-Louis-des-Invalides cathedral.

Many left flowers and apples, his favourite fruit.\n\nThe tributes will continue during the week, when the French team don black armbands for their Rugby World Cup match with the US in the Japanese city of Fukuoka.", "description": "World leaders gather to pay final respects to charismatic and popular former president", "authors": ["Kim Willsher", "Agn\u00e8s Poirier"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79f87d9e9dfcf31680143ab1304bc4892729423a/0_227_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=32e265a3b7cb92e0c350db021a65da6d", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
