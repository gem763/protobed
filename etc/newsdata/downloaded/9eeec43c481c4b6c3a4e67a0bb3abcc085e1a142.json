The next time he is on the mound for the AL East champions will be in the playoffs.\n\n\u201cAll in all, enough of a buildup as we head into the playoffs,\u201d manager Aaron Boone said. \u201cObviously not as sharp as he was in his last two, but I thought a nice rebound from the first inning where he struggled a little bit.\u201d\n\nSeverino had four walks and a throwing error over three innings in the Yankees\u2019 9-4 loss to the Texas Rangers on Saturday night.\n\nRougned Odor had a career-high six RBIs for the Rangers, including his 30th homer for a grand slam in the sixth to make it 8-1.\n\nOdor put the Rangers ahead to stay with a two-run double in the first, the only hit and runs allowed by Severino (1-1). The right-hander had already walked two batters and committed his error on a pickoff attempt by then.\n\nAfter three walks in the first inning, Severino retired seven of the last eight batters he faced. After feeling uncomfortable in the first, he struck out the side in the second - all swinging.\n\n\u201cIn the second and third I felt more like myself,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was everything. I didn\u2019t feel like myself (in the first). \u2026 The fastball was all over the place. Stride, I changed everything.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he was ready for the playoffs, Severino responded, \u201cYeah, of course. That was not my best start, but it doesn\u2019t matter. The most important thing is that I feel healthy.\u201d\n\nSeverino has pitched only 12 innings this season after recovering from a lat injury that had sidelined him since spring training. A 19-game winner in 2018, he struck out four while throwing 72 pitches against 14 Texas batters. He had tossed nine scoreless innings before that, four against the Los Angeles Angels and five against Toronto with nine strikeouts last Sunday.\n\nThe Rangers played the final night game at their ballpark before moving across the street to a new stadium next season. A day game Sunday wraps up the 26th and final season at the stadium that opened in 1994 as The Ballpark in Arlington.\n\nOdor raised his batting average from .202 to .204, still the lowest among the 136 major league qualifiers. But he has 93 RBIs along with the 30 homers, nine in September.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s finishing strong. The only thing I really challenge is the season\u2019s going to end after tomorrow,\u201d manager Chris Woodward said. \u201cI hope he has some truth and some understanding of what he\u2019s doing right now, because if this is the guy we could have all year, we\u2019d have a superstar.\u201d\n\nYankees leadoff hitter DJ LeMahieu went 0 for 3, his average slipping two points to .329. He trailed White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson (.337) for the major league lead. Anderson didn\u2019t play in the first game of Chicago\u2019s doubleheader before going 0 for 2 in the nightcap.\n\nThe Yankees led 1-0 after Aaron Judge tripled on a towering flyball to the left-center gap in the first and scored on a sacrifice fly by Brett Gardner. They didn\u2019t score again until Didi Gregorius had a three-run double with two outs in the ninth.\n\nJonathan Hern\u00e1ndez (2-1), the second of six Texas pitchers, threw two scoreless innings.\n\nBIG LEADS\n\nThe Rangers had five stolen bases, including two double steals in the first inning. They lead the majors with 128 stolen bases, 11 more than Kansas City. The Rangers have never finished a season with the most stolen bases in the majors. They led the American League with 126 in 1972, the franchise\u2019s first season in Texas, but were second in the majors behind Cincinnati\u2019s 140.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nYankees: New York got encouraging news about another starter when an MRI showed only nerve irritation for James Paxton. The lefty was removed after the first inning of the series opener Friday night, his last start before the playoffs, because of tightness and discomfort in his buttocks.\n\nPaxton, who had won 10 consecutive starts before that no-decision in the Yankees\u2019 14-7 win, said he was taking some pills to calm the irritation. Boone considered it minor and said he wasn\u2019t even concerned about it.\n\nAll-Star catcher Gary S\u00e1nchez, who returned Friday after missing 10 games with left groin tightness, didn\u2019t play. New York also held off again slugger Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n\u2019s return from a left oblique injury. The 36-year-old missed his 13th straight game.\n\nEncarnaci\u00f3n said after the game he\u2019s feeling much better.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m not 100 percent, I\u2019m close,\u201d he said through a translator.\n\nHe said he would be ready to play Friday in the Division Series opener against Minnesota even though he\u2019s not ready for a game just yet.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to have a setback,\u201d Encarnaci\u00f3n explained.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Rangers play their 2,081st and final regular-season game at the ballpark they have called home since 1994. They are moving across the street next season to a new $1 billion-plus stadium with a retractable roof. Masahiro Tanaka (11-8) is expected to pitch for the Yankees, but might not start. Lance Lynn (15-11) goes for the Rangers.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Luis Severino was a bit erratic but got through some adversity in his third start of the season for the New York Yankees.
