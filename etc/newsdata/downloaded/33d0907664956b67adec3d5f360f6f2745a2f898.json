Featured here are portraits by five of them. The images, included in the new book Always Audrey and chosen by photographic historian and curator Terence Pepper, have never been published before; those by Terry O\u2019Neill and Eva Sereny are unseen. Whether taken on set, in a studio or at her Italian villa, they confirm why Hepburn\u2019s image has had a grip on us ever since.\n\nDouglas Kirkland...", "description": "Stars don\u2019t come much more perfectly formed, or perfectly talented, than Audrey Hepburn.", "authors": ["Lucy Davies", "Bryony Gordon", "Judith Woods", "Dame Moya Greene Dbe", "Stephanie Baxter", "Rosa Silverman", "Allison Pearson", "Celia Walden"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/women/2019/10/03/audrey-cover-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqO4jRJTBpBksm1h_DkJ8m7o2V5ELr2vc4q6n3CBDI9f0.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
