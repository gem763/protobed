There are ways to overcome the anxiety disorder.", "language": "en", "text": "Desperate to get to Washington without resorting to a long train ride, Rhodes called into a weekly group-telephone chat run by Tom Bunn, a former Air Force and commercial airline pilot and licensed clinical social worker who runs a program for fearful fliers.\n\nBunn asked her what she was afraid of.\n\n\u201cI started crying,\u201d Rhodes recalled. She told the group what worried her. \u201cI am afraid of dying.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFear of flying, or aviophobia, is an anxiety disorder. About 40 percent of the general population reports some fear of flying, and 2.5 percent have what is classified as a clinical phobia, one in which a person avoids flying or does so with significant distress.\n\nAD\n\nAs with other situational phobias, the fear is disproportionate to the danger posed. Commercial air travel in the United States is extremely safe. A person who took a 500-mile flight every day for a year would have a fatality risk of 1 in 85,000, according to an analysis by Ian Savage, associate chair of the Economics Department at Northwestern University. In contrast, highway travel accounts for 94.4 percent of national transportation fatalities.\n\nBut for many, statistics are not enough to quell phobias.\n\nAD\n\nThe Anxiety and Depression Association of America suggests eight steps to help identify triggers and defuse them. Martin Seif, a clinical psychologist who wrote the steps, identifies the variety of conditions that may comprise the phobia \u2014 panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and panic disorder, among them.\n\nAD\n\nFor some, breathing exercises, anti-anxiety medication and cognitive behavioral therapy work. But the strategies do not work for everyone.\n\nBunn has worked with fearful fliers since 1980 after becoming curious about the psychological and physical components that produced anxiety and panic in situations that he as a pilot knew to be safe. He developed a set of mental exercises for fearful fliers. One, called the \u201cstrengthening exercise,\u201d links specific phases of air travel with a joyful personal memory, a visualization technique meant to trigger a sense of calm.\n\nAD\n\nRhodes had two months to prepare. She delved deeply into written exercises, videos, phone sessions. The day of her flight, she felt anxiety. But she was organized, equipped with magazines, memorized mental exercises and had an understanding of the expected noises and sensations of flight.\n\nAD\n\nIt worked.\n\n\u201cThe panic never came,\u201d she said, describing her flight. Since then, she has flown several more times, including a trip to Seattle to surprise her best friend.\n\nFear of flying, according to one overview, is far less studied than other conditions that can be detrimental to relationships and careers such as social anxiety, obsessive compulsive and post-traumatic stress disorders. Little is known about what keeps people afraid even after exposure to successful flights. And there are few experts in the field who are trained as both pilots and clinical social workers.\n\nAD\n\nStacey Chance, a pilot who flew with American Airlines for 30 years, runs a free online Fear of Flying Help Course, a one-hour overview of each aspect of flight. He includes video clips from therapists and pilots and printable checklists for managing anxiety. He was surprised to learn that many passengers fear they will \u201close control and open a door in flight,\u201d a scenario he said is impossible.\n\nAD\n\nThe door is pressurized.\n\nTonya McDaniel, a licensed clinical social worker at the Center for Growth in Philadelphia, uses a virtual-reality program designed for psychologists: While patients navigate stages of air travel with an avatar \u2014 from packing, boarding, takeoff and even weather \u2014 McDaniel monitors their heart rates and self-assessed level of distress, measured as SUDS (subjective units of distress scale.)\n\nAD\n\nThe goal of the exposure therapy is to recalibrate a person\u2019s response, eventually teaching the body that the experiences are \u201cnot dangerous and this is okay,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter patients complete the sessions, McDaniel encourages them to keep practicing, even if it is simply going to the airport to watch planes.\n\n\u201cPhobias breed on avoidance,\u201d she said.\n\nUntreated, the phobia takes a toll. Rhodes did not go to her grandmother\u2019s funeral or her best friend\u2019s wedding.\n\nAD\n\nBunn trained as a fighter pilot, a vocation he chose because growing up in a small town in North Carolina after World War II, \u201cthe ones who got all the attention were ex-pilots,\u201d he said. He finished top of his class in flight school and got assigned to the F-100 Super Sabre, a supersonic fighter.\n\nAD\n\nWhile based in Germany in the early 1960s, sitting around on \u201cnuclear alert,\u201d he delved into books on psychology, an interest spurred by his mother\u2019s mental illness. Later, as a commercial pilot for Pan Am, he helped a fellow pilot with a graduation class for fearful fliers run by the airline.\n\n\u201cPeople were sitting on the plane doing breathing exercises, doing exactly what we told them, and they still had panic,\u201d he said. It was awful to be so helpless, he thought.\n\nBy 1982, Bunn started his own course, and eventually earned a master\u2019s degree in social work at Fordham University. He did shifts at a Veterans Affairs hospital, and in 1996 retired from flying to work full time as a licensed clinical social worker in Bridgeport, Conn.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHis program for fearful fliers, SOAR, continued to grow until it became his sole focus. Clients, me among them, call him \u201cCaptain Tom.\u201d\n\nHe found that home study helped.\n\n\u201c[People] were in control,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have to show up in an airport and fly in two days,\u201d Bunn said.\n\nLisa Hauptner, a former client, quit her job in the corporate world to help run the business. Her own fear began as many do, with work-related stress and a sense of impending change.\n\n\u201cThere are usually stressors, good or bad, happening at the time,\u201d Hauptner said. \u201cThe average age of onset is 27. Think about what\u2019s going on when you are 27 years old. You may be getting married, or may be moving, or may be engaged or having a child.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy, often used to treat anxiety and panic with measurable results, was helping people on the ground, they found, but left them vulnerable to feelings of panic in flight. Once panic starts, \u201ccognitive ability is fried,\u201d Bunn said. Stress hormones and a fight or flight response take over.\n\nAD\n\nBunn said that people can \u201cretune\u201d their ability to calm themselves before panic escalates, relying on unconscious or procedural memory, the kind used to ride a bike. He offers exercises that are simple, but require practice, conditioning the body to respond to triggers (turbulence, for example) with less alarm.\n\nHe was influenced by the work of Stephen Porges, Distinguished University Scientist at Indiana University and Professor of Psychiatry at the University of North Carolina University, whose Polyvagal theory examines how our nervous system detects and responds to threat.\n\nPorges described Bunn\u2019s exercises as using \u201cvisualization to help people deal with fear of flying, or deal with anxiety.\u201d The images send the body cues that it is safe and not in a state of defense.\n\nAt age 83, Bunn is busy. He responds to 30 to 40 emails a day from anxious fliers and conducts up to eight private phone sessions. His weekly email goes to more than 17,000 subscribers. Last April, he released a book, \u201cPanic Free: The 10-Day Program to End Panic, Anxiety, and Claustrophobia,\u201d which uses the system developed for fearful fliers. Since the Boeing 737 Max crashes, activity has increased, he said.\n\nAD\n\nNot everyone responds to his system. Hauptner, who is also a mental health counselor, said fliers who are in the middle of another big event, such as a divorce or quitting smoking, may not respond. \u201cOr, they want perfection, and there is no perfection,\u201d she said.\n\nNo one strategy may work for everyone. Porges said some people find breathing exercises, a common coping strategy for panic, effective if done with a slow exhale.\n\nJoe Spatola sought help shortly after he got engaged, setting his sights on a honeymoon in Italy.\n\nSpatola said Bunn helped him break down his feelings, recognize his heartbeat and employ a technique for calming himself that transfers anxiety to a cartoon character.\n\n\u201cI use Popeye,\u201d he said. His biggest annoyance with turbulence now is not being able to get up to use the lavatory.\n\nI found \u201cCaptain Tom\u201d on the Internet 18 years ago, back when his program arrived in the mail on audiocassettes. My fear of flying hit at age 26 when I started a new job at CBS News \u2014 the age and phase of young adulthood when it typically manifests. I listened to the tapes. I read the typed material. I flew to my destination and worked on an assistant producing assignment.\n\nOn the return trip, I was delayed, first in Tallahassee and then in Atlanta because of mechanical problems. As the night wore on, my confidence waned, and I did not want to board the plane. I decided to try the phone session that came with my course.\n\nBunn picked up right away. His voice reflected his North Carolina upbringing and a calm demeanor, my idealized version of a pilot and therapist rolled into one. I flew home to New York and arrived late that evening, Sept. 10, 2001.\n\nThere was no good place to be the following day, tragedy hit families across the country and stranded travelers for days. My own anxieties shifted and grew, and it would take another concerted effort years later to work on flying again.", "description": "Therapies, breathing exercises, anti-anxiety medication and cognitive behavioral treatment are among the methods to counter aviophobia.", "authors": ["Sarah Vander Schaaff"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TXL5kITcpbxIMXTXytFYQymuSO8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BDUQAOHLPQI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
