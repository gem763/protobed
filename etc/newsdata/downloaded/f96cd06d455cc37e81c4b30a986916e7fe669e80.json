Terence Blanchard Wants to Try", "language": "en", "text": "In mid-July, trumpeter Terence Blanchard was on tour in Europe. News from home came fast and hard. New Orleans, his hometown, had been spared another flood, this time from Hurricane Barry\u2019s intense rains. Nearly five years to the day after Eric Garner\u2019s death from a Staten Island policeman\u2019s chokehold, U.S. Attorney General William Barr had ordered the case against Officer Daniel Pantaleo dropped; no federal civil rights charges would be filed. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump\u2019s tweets had suggested that four female Democratic Congress members \u201cgo back\u201d to \u201cthe totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came\u201d (notwithstanding that three of them were born in the U.S.).\n\nSuch headlines touch on the animating story lines behind Blanchard\u2019s music. His Grammy-winning 2007 album A Tale of God\u2019s Will expressed the aftermath of the flood resulting from the levee failures following Hurricane Katrina through jazz. In its lush but urgent music, his trumpet evoked the anguished cries of those left stranded on rooftops.\n\nBreathless, the hard-hitting first release from Blanchard\u2019s E-Collective band, was titled in reference to Eric Garner\u2019s plea\u2014\u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe\u201d\u2014while succumbing to that fatal chokehold.\n\nHis \u201cCaravan\u201d tour, which rolls into Miami on October 18, and St. Paul on October 25 and 26, blends that band\u2019s high-energy music with visual art, dance, and community outreach.\n\nNearly all of Blanchard\u2019s music during the past decade\u2014his albums, his film scores, and his two operas\u2014has been staked to themes of compassion and understanding, to the antithesis of what Trump tweets out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m embarrassed and heartbroken by so much of the news from home,\u201d Blanchard said on the phone from Poland when I caught up with him in July. He felt reassured to learn that the New Orleans levees held up to a swollen Mississippi River. \u201cStill, my experience after Katrina stirs up fear and mistrust anyway,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I have seen the real consequences of ineptitude and bad intent, how that plays out despite the news reports.\u201d He wondered aloud why another police officer entrusted with protecting citizens had to take another black life, and why he got away with it. And why a president charged with leading his country now promotes prejudice as policy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been traveling this world as a musician since I was 19 years old,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the one thing I\u2019ve learned is that everybody wants to be loved and to be respected. Intolerance lies at the heart of our problems. And complacency doesn\u2019t cut it. Compassionate people cannot sit back anymore.\u201d\n\nMore so than his distinctiveness as a trumpeter\u2014the curled notes that recall his New Orleans roots and the daring improvisations that signal modern jazz\u2019s ambitions\u2014what has propelled Blanchard\u2019s career for the past 30 years is his ability to tell resonant tales, to express empathy and purpose through music. That\u2019s what drummer Art Blakey heard in Blanchard\u2019s early compositions for Blakey\u2019s Jazz Messengers more than three decades ago, and why Spike Lee has staked his film\u2019s narratives to Blanchard\u2019s music for nearly 30 years as well.\n\nAnd if the context for Blanchard\u2019s music has often been ripped from the headlines, his career itself has sometimes made for breaking news, as when the Metropolitan Opera recently announced its plans to present his opera Fire Shut Up in My Bones\u2014the first such recognition for an African American composer in the organization\u2019s 136-year history.\n\nBlanchard\u2019s E-Collective band\u2014\u201ca groove-based kinda-jazz group,\u201d he called it\u2014began as \u201ca way to loosen up and have fun.\u201d That changed during the group\u2019s first overseas tour. \u201cTrayvon Martin had already been murdered,\u201d Blanchard said. \u201cThen Eric Garner got choked to death. Then Mike Brown got shot. Then Tamir Rice, who was only 12 years old. It was relentless, and it made us feel a bit helpless, especially far from home.\u201d That helplessness lent focus. When Blanchard brought the band into the studio he told them, \u201cWe can\u2019t make a feel-good record now.\u201d\n\nBlanchard followed Breathless with 2017\u2019s Live, which was recorded during E-Collective performances at venues in three communities marked by violence: the Bop Stop, in Cleveland, near where Tamir Rice was shot in 2014; the Dakota, in Minneapolis, not far from the St. Paul neighborhood where Philando Castile was pulled over and shot dead by a cop six months earlier; and the Wyly Theatre in Dallas, in a community then still making sense of the deaths of five police officers assassinated while on duty at a peaceful Black Lives Matter protest.\n\nThe longest and best track on that album was a 17-minute version of \u201cChoices,\u201d a remake of the title track of 2009 album; included in the mix, triggered by Blanchard\u2019s foot pedals, were sampled snippets of Dr. Cornel West\u2019s spoken words, drawn from an extended conversation with the trumpeter \u201cabout God\u2019s will and man\u2019s choices,\u201d Blanchard said. Well into that tune, after the cheers from the Wyly Theater audience died down, Blanchard stated his theme\u2014tinged with a blues feel, gently soaring and then edged with rage. West\u2019s voice\u2014recorded a decade ago, yet eerily timely\u2014interrupted: \u201cHow would we prepare for death?\u2026 It comes down to what? Choice. What kind of human being you going to be? How you gonna opt for life of decency and compassion and service and love?\u201d\n\nAt a panel discussion the day before that Dallas performance, Blanchard had said, \u201cPeople always ask us what kind of band is this, what we\u2019re trying to do. We really don\u2019t know what to say. That rage builds up in you, and it comes out however it\u2019s supposed to. I don\u2019t even try to guide it. It\u2019s not my responsibility. I\u2019m tired of talking. It\u2019s about action. This is our action.\u201d\n\nIn April, Blanchard and his E-Collective band were back in Dallas, this time at the invitation of the Soluna Festival, an annual event created and anchored by the Dallas Symphony Orchestra that spans more than three weeks and a wide range of performing arts. The Soluna Festival admirably erases borders between artistic disciplines as well as between notions of high and low culture, and it engages artists and audiences well beyond the setting of performance venues. At Soluna, Blanchard\u2019s \u201cCaravan: A Revolution on the Road\u201d was meant as both a continuation of his musical response to troubling issues and a fresh attempt to blend visual art and dance into his performance, through collaborations with artist Andrew Scott and choreographer Rennie Harris\u2019s Pure American Street Dance Theater Company.\n\nTwo days before that performance, the Dallas Film Society, one of Soluna\u2019s many partner organizations, hosted a screening of Spike Lee\u2019s BlacKkKlansman, followed by a public discussion. Blanchard\u2019s Grammy-winning score for that film, which was also nominated for an Oscar, extends a relationship with Lee that began in 1989. His was the trumpet behind Denzel Washington\u2019s Bleek, in Lee\u2019s Mo Better Blues. He played Billie Holiday\u2019s tuxedoed trumpeter onscreen in Lee\u2019s Malcolm X. During one riveting scene in Lee\u2019s post-Katrina documentary When the Levees Broke, Blanchard escorts his mother back to her home, where she breaks down crying upon realizing that everything is destroyed. (Lee, who is the son of jazz bassist Bill Lee, once told me that \u201cin the pantheon of artists, I put musicians first.\u201d Blanchard, he said, \u201cis my secret weapon.\u201d)\n\n\u201c 'You realize that, in this country during the past four decades, in some ways, we haven\u2019t really gotten very far.' \u201d \u2014 Terence Blanchard\n\nIn Dallas, Blanchard reflected on this long association. He also recalled how, during early screenings of BlacKkKlansman, people questioned why a movie about racism set in the '70s ended with a montage of recent events, most notably the death of Heather Heyer, who was killed in a car attack during a peaceful counter-protest in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017. \u201cSpike needed that in there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt presented a certain type of grief that we feel too often in this country, because her death was senseless. And it hinted at a bigger narrative of American history: You realize that, in this country during the past four decades, in some ways, we haven\u2019t really gotten very far.\u201d\n\nThe next afternoon, Blanchard participated in a community conversation at Dallas Black Dance Theater. The panel included Scott, who teaches art and technology at the University of Texas at Dallas, and who first met Blanchard more than 30 years ago, when they both lived in Brooklyn. Scott recalled long-ago \u201cmidnight talks about making art that had meaning,\u201d and, more recently, how their present collaboration took shape.\n\nScott had been working on images based on the mangrove, a tree and shrub common in tropical and subtropical regions that is remarkably resilient in harsh conditions. Around that same time, Blanchard was working on the music for Breathless. \u201cWe were both trying to come up with language in our respective forms that spoke to what was going on,\u201d Scott said. Blanchard saw a Flikr post of Scott\u2019s mangrove project, and it answered a need. \u201cI had been struggling with how to explain to the record company the kind of image I would need to wrap together all the subtexts underlying the music,\u201d he said. Blanchard sent Scott rough cuts of his album. Inspired by the music, Scott came up with something new\u2014part raised fist, part tree trunk, evocative of both sturdy wood and delicate stained glass, and emblazoned with the image of a dove in its center\u2014that ended up on the cover of Blanchard\u2019s album.\n\nAt the Dance Theater in Dallas, the most moving panelist testimony came from Colette Flanagan, a former IBM executive who founded Mothers Against Police Brutality after her son, Clinton Allen, was shot to death by a Dallas police officer in 2013 despite his being unarmed. \u201cWhen you lose a child to police brutality, it breaks the social contract,\u201d she said, \u201cso that\u2019s a double grief.\u201d She spoke about finding her own voice as an activist through artistic endeavors. \u201cIt has helped in a way that I did not understand at first,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat art does is, it gives a voice to the voiceless. It gives victims and communities a platform to be heard.\u201d\n\nBlanchard shared a story about how his grown son had been handcuffed and nearly booked for a robbery in a case of mistaken identity in New Orleans. He also mentioned that one of his best childhood friends is now a police officer. He talked about finding his voice, too. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be an opera composer, that\u2019s for damn sure,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yet I am now. And I never wanted to call myself an activist, but you get to the point where you just have to say something.\u201d\n\nThe audience for Blanchard\u2019s performance at Dallas\u2019s Majestic Theater the next evening was large, diverse and unusually responsive. The music was alternatively loud and tender, consistently hard-grooving and mostly intense. Harris\u2019s dancers, grounded in hip-hop culture more so than any other tradition, didn\u2019t so much move to the music as with it, telling stories with their bodies that were often quite literal and sometimes disturbing. An interracial couple falls in love and then slips into violence. A young black man dies by gunfire.\n\nMeanwhile, Scott\u2019s visual imagery, projected onto a backdrop, was in constant flux. The mangrove symbol from Blanchard\u2019s \u201cBreathless\u201d album was now part peace symbol. And it kept morphing\u2014containing something like a Third Eye, then an American flag, and on. Scott and an associate had cameras and microphones trained on the band and projectors, and synchronized to respond to the band\u2019s sound so that various instruments, pitches and dynamics affected the colors, tones and feel of the stage and its backdrop. The projected images moved from abstraction to clear reference, sometimes of the very incidents and protests that inspired Blanchard\u2019s music. At the end of the performance, as one dancer mourned another\u2019s fallen body, Blanchard stepped forward, playing solo trumpet, essaying the melody of \u201cChoices,\u201d this time without West\u2019s words\u2014just sound, movement and color to evoke the feeling of one more senseless death.\n\n\u201cThe best thing about \u2018Caravan\u2019 was that it pushed people out of their comfort zone,\u201d said Gillian Friedman Fox, who directs Soluna\u2019s programming for the Dallas Symphony. \u201cThat\u2019s what we aim to do but more to the point it\u2019s what these three artists from three different disciplines needed to do. And it\u2019s what our community needed, too.\u201d\n\nDallas is a city indelibly marked by gun violence. The day after witnessing \"Caravan,\" I visited the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, located in the former Texas School Book Depository and commemorating the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Near a grassy knoll, along an on-ramp, two painted white X\u2019s mark the spots where Kennedy was struck by bullets, first in the throat and then, fatally, in the head.\n\nBut what American city isn\u2019t so marked? In mid-June, Blanchard was at Opera Theatre of St. Louis for the premiere of Fire Shut Up in My Bones, based on the memoir of New York Times columnist Charles Blow. In the opening scene, the opera\u2019s main character brandishes a gun. \u201cWelcome to Gibsland,\u201d announces an early lyric, \u201cwhere violence is in our DNA, and the law ain\u2019t on our side.\u201d And later on: \u201cA black boy from a lawless town / where everyone carries a gun.\u201d (Gibsland, Louisiana, where Blow grew up, is famous mostly for the deaths of Bonnie and Clyde by police ambush.) Also, this: \u201cJustice is but a fairy tale / to make children good.\u201d\n\nBlow\u2019s story is a wrenching tale of a black boy growing up in a segregated rural Louisiana town, of a childhood shaped by cycles of violence and turbulence, and of the lasting wounds of childhood sexual molestation by a family member. In his tale, Blow doesn\u2019t pull that trigger. The real violence is of a different sort, its damage less visible to the naked eye. And the focus is on healing. In a New York Times column after the opera\u2019s opening, Blow recalled that Blanchard had insisted he not see or hear any of the material before the show, and how the resulting experience \u201cremade me.\u201d\n\nKasi Lemmons wrote the opera\u2019s libretto, continuing a series of collaborations with Blanchard that began with her 1997 film Eve\u2019s Bayou, and extends to Harriet, her next film, a biopic about Harriet Tubman, set for November release. Lemmons was drawn to Blanchard\u2019s music initially for its inherent soulfulness, she said. \u201cBut there\u2019s something more. There\u2019s something inherently political about my work, not explicitly stated. And I\u2019ve always gotten that same sense from Terence\u2019s music.\u201d\n\nBy August, around the time of the shooting massacres in El Paso and Dayton, Blanchard was holed up in a Manhattan music studio, putting the final touches on the score for Lemmons\u2019 film about Tubman, the former slave, abolitionist, and \u201cconductor\u201d on the Underground Railroad who, according to a May announcement by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, will not become the face of the $20 bill until after President Trump leaves office. (More prejudice as policy.)\n\nMeantime, Blanchard was readying a new apartment in Los Angeles, where he will serve as the inaugural Kenny Burrell Chair in Jazz Studies at UCLA\u2019s Herb Alpert School of Music.\n\nThe last time we spoke, he described what he\u2019d soaked up from his own mentors: from his high-school band director, Roger Dickerson; his early employer, drummer Art Blakey; and from the elder jazz statesmen he\u2019s worked with, such as Herbie Hancock and Wayne Shorter. \u201cThere was always the music and the history and the stuff you absolutely need to know,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there was the demand to find your own voice, not to imitate. But they all also talked to me about my role as a human being and not just a musician, about bigger truths that go beyond art.\u201d\n\nBlanchard\u2019s \u201cCaravan\u201d aims to further his combination of music, dance and visual art, and sophisticated take on funk. \u201cBut that\u2019s hardly the real point,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re treating this as a group of like-minded people moving around the country with a message. If we can all repair the soul of this country, we\u2019re going to have to get creative, and do it bit by bit. Get on the bandwagon, don\u2019t fall for the okey-doke.\u201d", "description": "Through albums, film scores, operas, and his multi-media \u201cCaravan,\u201d jazz artist Terence Blanchard\u2019s music takes aim at violence and intolerance, setting its sights on compassion.", "authors": ["Larry Blumenfeld"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_2998,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569106662/190922-blumenfeld-terence-blanchard-hero_uajerq", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
