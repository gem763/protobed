The accusation stems from analysis of social media, interviews with witnesses, data provided by local plane spotters and records of communications of the Russian military deployed in Syria. The bombings, which happened on May 5 and 6, are just a faction of attacks on civilian infrastructure, for which Moscow carries responsibility, the newspaper alleged.\n\nResponding to the accusation on Monday, the Russian military said Times report was flawed for several reasons, including failure to explain that Idlib Governorate, where the four alleged bombings took place, lives under rule of brutal jihadists. That detail affects the entire narrative, indicating its flawed sourcing.\n\n\u201cGadgets, modern radio scanners, protected notebooks, internet connection are all things that the local civilian population simply cannot afford. They are more interested in daily surviving under the yoke of the terrorists,\u201d said Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov.\n\nAlso on rt.com Syrian Army moving to face \u2018Turkish aggression\u2019 in the north \u2013 state media\n\nHe was referring to the equipment used by \u201cplane spotters\u201d, who provided their data to Times. The newspaper said those observers \u201cinsisted on anonymity for their safety\u201d, but the Russian military says they shouldn\u2019t have bothered and identified them as the people behind a \u201ccombat intelligence system\u201d based on equipment developed by a US company called Hala Systems.\n\nThe system known as Sentry is a collection of suitcase-sized sensors connected into a network plus an AI-based algorithm, which uses signals from those sensors as well as social media data to analyze and predict airstrikes in Idlib. Hala Systems says it\u2019s a for-profit company that develops and operates the system on grants from governments of Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark the United States, and Germany.\n\nAlso on rt.com Color revolutionaries of the world, unite! Hong Kong protest leader pictured with White Helmets boss\n\nThe company deemed it necessary to explain in its FAQ that it is not a front for the CIA, but acknowledges that it deployed the system in conjunction with the notorious White Helmets, the group that operated in jihadist-held parts of Syria with strongly suspected ties to Western intelligence services.\n\nThe statement by Konashenkov said Times chose to omit those details because they clearly expose its source as potentially compromised rather than to protect anyone.\n\nThe \u2018evidence\u2019 published by NYT are not worthy even of the paper it was printed on.\n\nHe added there were inconsistencies with other parts of the report, in particular a claim that a Russian pilot received coordinates for his target openly on the air, which would have been in violation of military operating procedures.\n\nHe also questioned identification of one of the locations named by the Times as a civilian hospital, saying it was not clear how one can operate in a remote cave.\n\n\u201cJust a week ago we took over 80 journalists from leading Russian and international media to a cave located in that general area. They saw with their own eyes what is kept in such caves, or rather reinforced terrorist bunkers,\u201d the Russian general said.\n\n\u201cThere were large stockpiles of weapons and ammunition, including those Western-made, prisons, holes to cover tanks, gas masks, food and medical supplies.\u201d\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
