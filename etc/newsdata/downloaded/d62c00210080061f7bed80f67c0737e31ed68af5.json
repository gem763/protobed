REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nPaul Burrell, a longtime royal servant who became Princess Diana\u2019s personal assistant and confidante, has watched as Harry has pushed back against media intrusion and sought to protect his wife, the American-born, biracial Duchess of Sussex.\n\n\u201cThey (Charles and Diana) didn\u2019t have what Harry and Meghan have,\u201d Burrell told Reuters on Wednesday. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have love. And they (Harry and Meghan) love each other. It\u2019s quite obvious when you see them together.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s parents, Charles, the Prince of Wales, and Diana, divorced in 1996 after 15 years of largely unhappy marriage, and his mother was killed in a 1997 road accident while being chased by paparazzi.\n\nBurrell, 61, has become a frequent commentator on Diana and the royal family since leaving the palace after Diana\u2019s death, and was in New York promoting a documentary at a contentious time for Prince Harry.\n\nHarry, 35, said in a recently aired ITV interview that he would \u201cnot be bullied into playing a game that killed my mum.\u201d He and Meghan are also taking legal action against media groups to protect their privacy.\n\nPrince William and his wife Kate Middleton have enjoyed a smoother ride from the palace and the press because their future is largely predetermined, Burrell said.\n\nPrince William, 37, is second in line, after Prince Charles, 70, to the throne of Queen Elizabeth, 93. Harry is sixth in line, behind William\u2019s children.\n\nThe two brothers are often called \u201cthe heir and the spare,\u201d which Harry hates, Burrell said, and Harry also admitted to ITV that some distance had grown between them.\n\n\u201cHarry said that (he and William) are on different paths. I know what he means by that. William and Kate have a map in front of them. They\u2019re headed for monarchy,\u201d Burrell said, adding that the Queen and Charles have left Harry to find his way.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no guidance. There\u2019s no support. There\u2019s no rulebook,\u201d Burrell said.\n\nTo escape the glare, Harry and Meghan are considering buying a home in California, British media have said.\n\n\u201cI hope we don\u2019t lose Harry and Meghan (to California) because they are a tremendous asset to the royal family, and to Britain,\u201d Burrell said.", "description": "Britain's Prince Harry and wife Meghan Markle are well placed to ride out the media storm around them and avoid the pitfalls that tore apart his parents, Charles and Diana, for the simplest of reasons, Diana's former butler said: They love each other.", "authors": ["Angela Moore", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444306853&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N00E", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
