The Guatemalan government used hacked and stolen social media accounts to silence dissenting opinions. Ethiopia\u2019s ruling party hired people to influence social media conversations in its favor.\n\nDespite increased efforts by internet platforms like Facebook to combat internet disinformation, the use of the techniques by governments around the world is growing, according to a report released Thursday by researchers at Oxford University. Governments are spreading disinformation to discredit political opponents, bury opposing views and interfere in foreign affairs.\n\nThe researchers compiled information from news organizations, civil society groups and governments to create one of the most comprehensive inventories of disinformation practices by governments around the world. They found that the number of countries with political disinformation campaigns more than doubled to 70 in the last two years, with evidence of at least one political party or government entity in each of those countries engaging in social media manipulation.\n\nIn addition, Facebook remains the No. 1 social network for disinformation, the report said. Organized propaganda campaigns were found on the platform in 56 countries.", "description": "Governments are using \u201ccyber troops\u201d to discredit political opponents, bury opposing views and interfere in foreign affairs, according to Oxford researchers.", "authors": ["Davey Alba", "Adam Satariano"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/business/26disinfo1-sub/merlin_159846195_3eef48f8-e7c4-4f12-820d-c9de7a7d30a9-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
