Guyger, who is white, reached out to hug Kemp after the judge handed her a bible to read while incarcerated.\n\nKemp, who is black, said her actions were appropriate because the trial had ended.\n\n\u201cI came down to extend my condolences to the Jean family and to encourage Ms Guyger because she has a lot of life to live,\u201d the judge told the Associated Press.\n\n\u201cShe asked me if I thought that God could forgive her and I said, \u2018Yes, God can forgive you and has.\u2019 If she wanted to start with the Bible, I didn\u2019t want her to go back to the jail and to sink into doubt and self-pity and become bitter. Because she still has a lot of life ahead of her following her sentence and I would hope that she could live it purposefully.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t understand the anger. Judge Tammy Kemp\n\nThe embrace sparked fierce criticism. A secular group, the Freedom From Religion Foundation, filed a complaint with Texas authorities over what it argues is judicial misconduct.\n\nThe complaint alleges Kemp committed an \u201cegregious abuse of power\u201d by displaying her religious beliefs while carrying out her duties.\n\nKemp rejected that argument, telling AP: \u201cI could not refuse that woman a hug.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cAnd I don\u2019t understand the anger. And I guess I could say if you profess religious beliefs and you are going to follow them, I would hope that they not be situational and limited to one race only.\u201d\n\nThe judge was not the only person to reach out to Guyger in court. Jean\u2019s younger brother, Brandt, also hugged Guyger, telling her he forgave her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m speaking for myself, not my family, but I love you just like anyone else,\u201d he said.\n\nJean\u2019s father, Bertrum, has said he also forgives Guyger, though he thinks her sentence should have been longer. Prosecutors sought 28 years, the age Jean would have been now had he lived.\n\nGuyger lived one floor below Jean and said she entered his apartment thinking it was hers. She shot him because she said she thought he was a burglar. Jean was sitting watching TV and eating ice cream at the time of the incident.\n\nCriminal justice groups expressed relief at the relatively rare sight of a white police officer being convicted for killing an unarmed black man. But some have criticized the outpouring of forgiveness towards Guyger.\n\nThe trauma of the case has been further exacerbated by the killing of a witness who gave evidence during the trial.\n\nJoshua Brown, who lived in the same apartment complex as Jean and Guyger and testified he heard two people talking followed by gunfire, was himself shot dead in Dallas on Friday. Police have yet to publicly identify a motive or suspect for the crime.", "description": "Judge Tammy Kemp embraced Amber Guyger at the conclusion of a trial \u2018to encourage Ms Guyger because she has a lot of life to live\u2019", "authors": ["Oliver Milman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba47c19049338b65efbfd4cf2e0c51758a97382a/0_113_6042_3625/master/6042.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bc855b10f72bfe88982ce89003f23d63", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
