Having won with an admirable drive at the Belgian Grand Prix, Leclerc also acknowledged that racing would always include an element of danger that could not be removed.\n\nLeclerc beat Lewis Hamilton to victory at Spa-Francorchamps but the 21-year-old spoke of how difficult it had been after Hubert died in the wake of a crash in an F2 race on Saturday.\n\nCharles Leclerc wins F1 Belgian GP, Hamilton takes second \u2013 as it happened Read more\n\n\u201cWe have lost a friend first of all and it\u2019s very difficult in these situations, so I would like to dedicate this win to him,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t fully enjoy my first victory but it is a memory that will live with me forever.\u201d\n\nThe pair had raced together since they were seven years old and remained good friends, sharing their ambition of making it to F1. \u201cSince I was a child I\u2019ve been looking up to Formula One,\u201d Leclerc said. \u201cDreaming to be a Formula One driver.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good day but on the other hand losing Anthoine brings me back to 2005, my first ever French championship. There was him, Esteban [Ocon], Pierre [Gasly] and myself. We were four kids that were dreaming of Formula One. We grew up in karting for many many years and to lose him yesterday was a big shock for me and obviously for everyone in motor sport it was a very sad day.\u201d\n\nCharles Leclerc claims Belgian Grand Prix for first victory in F1 Read more\n\nHubert\u2019s accident at the top of Eau Rouge took place at approaching 150mph and was extremely violent, involving an impact into the barriers and then a second blow from another car.\n\nLeclerc said: \u201cIt will always remain a dangerous sport. Once you are going at this speed, it is dangerous. Here Eau Rouge is quite dangerous because the wall is quite close. There will always be some corners which are challenging and more dangerous than others.\u201d\n\nHamilton, who chased Leclerc to the flag, also acknowledged what a strong job the 21-year-old had done all season against his Ferrari teammate, Sebastian Vettel. \u201cHis results speak for him,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not easy for any driver to jump into a top team like Ferrari against a four-times world champion with God knows how much experience and then to continuously, race on race, outperform, out-qualify and out-drive him.\u201d", "description": "Charles Leclerc described his maiden F1 victory in the Belgian GP as the realisation of a childhood dream but said it was hard to enjoy it after the death of his friend Anthoine Hubert", "authors": ["Giles Richards"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/304e59f71b304b5d2009031d840c559b1c8b6469/0_27_3716_2229/master/3716.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bbc62c74b4f4298177f900b2b1b578e8"}
