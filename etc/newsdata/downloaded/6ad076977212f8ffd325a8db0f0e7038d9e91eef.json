It\u2019s a rematch of the 2017 meeting that ended with Urawa lifting the trophy.\n\nAl Hilal held on for a 6-5 aggregate win over Qatar\u2019s Al Sadd on Tuesday. Al Sadd won the second leg 4-2 in Riyadh, but it wasn\u2019t enough to overturn a 4-1 home loss from the first leg.\n\nAl Hilal has never won the tournament but will be playing in its third final in six years.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Urawa Reds advanced to their second Asian Champions League final in three years after Shinzo Koroki's second-half header gave the Japanese team a 1-0 win at Guangzhou Evergrande on Wednesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
