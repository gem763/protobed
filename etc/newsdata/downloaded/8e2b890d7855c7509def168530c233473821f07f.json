REUTERS/Neil Hall\n\nIt said that while overall UK grocery sales grew 0.5% during the 12 weeks to Sept. 8 compared to the same period last year on a value basis, households had bought 0.9% fewer items.\n\n\u201cAs we move closer to 31 October, it seems talk about stockpiling might be just that, because we\u2019re not seeing any evidence of it at the moment,\u201d Kantar said.\n\nIn contrast to consumers, supermarket groups have built up stocks of ambient goods, such as toilet rolls, tinned tomatoes and olive oil.\n\nKantar\u2019s data showed Sainsbury\u2019s (SBRY.L) recorded the smallest sales decline of Britain\u2019s big four supermarket groups in the latest 12-week period, indicating a tentative recovery after a prolonged period of underperformance.\n\nKantar said Sainsbury\u2019s sales fell 0.1% in the 12 weeks to Sept. 8. That compared with falls of 1.4%, 1% and 2% at market leader Tesco (TSCO.L), Asda (WMT.N) and Morrisons (MRW.L) respectively.\n\n\u201cThis was Sainsbury\u2019s strongest period since October 2018 and it was the best performing of the big four retailers for the second month in a row,\u201d said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar.\n\nSainsbury\u2019s had its proposed 7.3 billion pound takeover of Walmart-owned Asda blocked by Britain\u2019s competition regulator in April. It is due to update on strategy on Sept. 25 when it hosts investors at a capital markets day.\n\nAll of the big four still lost market share to German-owned discounters Aldi and Lidl, who continue to aggressively open new stores. Their combined share now stands at 14.1%.\n\nShares in Sainsbury\u2019s were down 2.7% at 1047 GMT, while Tesco was down 1.3% and Morrisons was down 2.7%.\n\nAldi said on Monday it planned to invest 1 billion pounds into Britain over the next two years despite reporting a 26% drop in operating profit for 2018.", "description": "There is no evidence that Britons worried about the possibility of a disorderly departure from the European Union on Oct. 31 are stockpiling essential products, market researcher Kantar said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430821456&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0VC", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
