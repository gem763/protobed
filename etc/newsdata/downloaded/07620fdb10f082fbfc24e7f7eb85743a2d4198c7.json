Stay patient, say most pros, and don\u2019t be so fast to subscribe to consensus thinking that a Warren will obliterate stock prices.\n\n\u201cWe would advise investors to be cautious against two dimensions when thinking about elections and their portfolios today. One, it\u2019s really hard to tell who is going to win. As we learned in 2016, even the day of the election it\u2019s hard to tell who will win. And beyond that, it\u2019s hard to forecast the asset price response. We would caution investors to be very humble with their ability to forecast the election outcome,\u201d BlackRock global chief investment strategist Mike Pyle said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen.

Just this week alone, well-known financiers such as Leon Cooperman and Mark Mobius have issued warnings of a 25% stock market plunge if Warren gains the White House.\n\nOne market veteran Yahoo Finance talked with was more blunt, stating a case for a 50% market crash. The worry makes a great deal of sense, although a 50% decline in stocks seems like an absurd prediction.\n\nWarren may not see herself as punitive toward capitalism (as she pointed out in this week\u2019s debate), but she so often celebrates her fight against Facebook\u2019s business practices. Warren has railed against big businesses, pushed for a wealth tax to pay for Medicare for All and other social safety net programs and tightened financial rules post Great Recession as chairman of the Congressional Oversight Panel.\n\nBut as all investors learned from the outcome of the 2016 election that saw Donald Trump shockingly win, stocks could surprise the conventionally held logic. Recall, most on Wall Street expected stocks to crater if the unpredictable Trump won \u2014 stocks since then have generally rallied amid Trump\u2019s corporate tax cuts and fight against regulatory roadblocks.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
