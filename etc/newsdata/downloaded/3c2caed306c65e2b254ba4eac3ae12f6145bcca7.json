It eventually met the target in 2010, mainly thanks to the shuttering of old East German factories.\n\nThat same year, Merkel predicted that by 2020, there would be 1 million electric cars on German roads. At the beginning of 2019, the total was just 83,000. In August she revised her target, saying she now believes Germany can meet the goal by 2022 at the latest.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to catch up fast,\u201d she said last month.\n\nGermans don\u2019t seem to care that Merkel has led them down the garden path with rosy predictions. What most have come to expect of the chancellor, whom many Germans only half-jokingly call Mutti (Mom), is reassurance. In a highly industrialized country such as Germany, there's a natural tension between citizens' desire for continued prosperity and their wish to be good stewards of the environment.\n\nEven so, with the effects of global warming increasingly apparent and Germany missing one climate target after the next, pretending Mutti will come through has gotten a lot harder.\n\nMerkel has tackled that contradiction by telling Germans what they want to hear \u2014 that the climate situation is serious but manageable with a bit of German ingenuity. They pretend to believe her.\n\nMerkel's grand climate change plan is expected to cost more than \u20ac50 billion in the coming years, but will still be \"budget neutral\" (read: won\u2019t force Germany into the red), the government insisted on Friday. The chancellor understands that while Germans want to save the environment, they don't want to pay too much for it.\n\nThe clutch of coal\n\nEven so, with the effects of global warming increasingly apparent and Germany missing one climate target after the next, pretending Mutti will come through has gotten a lot harder.\n\nMerkel\u2019s most celebrated environmental decision as chancellor was her move in 2011 to accelerate Germany\u2019s withdrawal from nuclear energy in the wake of the Fukushima disaster in Japan. Though many Germans still take pride in the call to withdraw from nuclear power (an example they were disappointed to see other countries did not follow), it has made Germany even more dependent on coal. To compensate for the loss in nuclear power and sustain its energy-hungry industrial economy, Germany has been forced in recent years to burn more coal, dashing its hopes of reducing climate emissions.\n\nCoal accounts for about 35 percent of German electricity generation. Even as more and more Germans say they\u2019re extremely worried about climate change, villages in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia are still being bulldozed to allow for coal mining.\n\nWhile the country has succeeded in expanding wind and solar, the centerpiece of Merkel's climate strategy known as the Energiewende (energy transformation), has come at a huge cost. Retail electricity prices have more than doubled since 2000, leaving Germany with the highest prices in Europe.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Energiewende has been plagued with problems, from local resistance to construction of transmission lines and wind turbines to soft demand from investors.\n\nA key north-south transmission corridor to transport renewable energy from the windy northern reaches of Germany to the industrial corners of the south is years behind schedule. The result is an overcapacity of renewable energy in the north and more coal burning in the south.\n\nIf those issues aren\u2019t resolved soon, Germany is unlikely to meet Merkel\u2019s goal to draw 65 percent of the country's electricity from renewable sources by 2030, much less her more ambitious target to be \"climate neutral\" by 2050.\n\nOf course by then, Merkel\u2019s promises will be someone else\u2019s problem.", "description": "Ambitious new plan is expected to cost more than \u20ac50B, but will still be \u2018budget netural,\u2019 according to German chancellor.", "authors": ["Matthew Karnitschnig", "Kalina Oroschakoff", "Joshua Posaner", "Paola Tamma"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1175925516-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
