A violent melee broke out as a group of six or seven assailants lunged at Morris and a couple of his friends. Other teenagers filmed as boys beat Morris, and then did nothing as Morris lay bleeding on the pavement, fighting for his life from a stab wound to his chest.\n\nThe assailants all fled. The videos all circulated.\n\nMorris died in the hospital hours later.\n\n\u201cKids stood here and didn\u2019t help Khaseen,\u201d Nassau County Police Det. Lt. Stephen Fitzpatrick said at a news conference Tuesday. \u201cThey would rather video this event. They videoed his death instead of helping him.\u201d\n\nThe case is the latest example of a brutal beating captured on video and turned into entertainment on Snapchat and other social media platforms, leaving a digital footprint of a violent tragedy. Fitzpatrick spoke directly to the teenagers who filmed, admonishing them for standing idly with their cellphones as one of their peers died. The videos have helped police identify most of the assailants, Fitzpatrick said. But still, he said, there should never have been Snapchat videos of the high school junior\u2019s killing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to make of it, my generation versus this generation,\u201d he said of the phenomenon. \u201cThis can\u2019t go on. Your friends are dying while you stand there and video it. That\u2019s egregious.\u201d\n\nFitzpatrick said arrests are imminent, but police are still seeking more information on other attackers, who are believed to be from multiple local high schools.\n\nFriends, family and classmates gathered in the strip mall\u2019s lot for a vigil Tuesday night. In an interview with Newsday, Morris\u2019s older sisters described him as free-spirited and artistic, an aspiring photographer who liked to draw anime and write his own music. He dyed half his dreadlocks burnt orange, and rode his skateboard around the neighborhood blasting a mix of rap and punk music from his speakers. The family had just moved to Oceanside from neighboring Freeport, N.Y., and Morris\u2019s sister, Keyanna Morris, said he finally felt like he fit in.\n\n\u201cWhen he came here,\u201d the 30-year-old told Newsday, \u201che was able to be his kind of different with no judgment and he loved it. The moment he stepped foot in Oceanside, everyone loved him.\u201d\n\nBut then came a fight over a girl \u2014 all because Morris walked her home. His sisters said the other boy began sending threatening messages before school that morning, leading to the fight later that day.\n\n\u201cHim being so nice, that one good deed that he did got him killed,\u201d 22-year-old Kedeemah Morris, his sister, told the New York Times.\n\nIn recent years, everything from fatal overdoses to wild fights in broad daylight have wound up on Snapchat and Facebook and YouTube. Last month, a 14-year-old died of an apparent drug overdose while other teens filmed his distress at a skate park in British Columbia and took pictures, saying, \u201cCarson almost died LOL.\u201d In 2017, a man was beaten to death with a glass liquor bottle in the middle of rush hour in Chicago as people drove and walked by \u2014 or stopped to record a video, the Daily Beast reported. None intervened to help.\n\n\u201cThis is the society we live in now, where things like this sometimes become the next viral video,\u201d a Chicago police officer told the Daily Beast at the time.\n\nIn Morris\u2019s case, eventually, the video made its way to his family. Keyanna Morris wept as she recalled watching her brother bleed out on the ground, Newsday reported.\n\n\u201cHe was in so much pain,\u201d she said.", "description": "\"This can\u2019t go on.
