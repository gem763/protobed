However, over time they managed to put their differences aside, and \u2014 as they did so \u2014 they ended up becoming rather close. The last couple of months have seen the two bond, and they\u2019ve spent quite a bit of time in each other\u2019s company \u2014 and even shared a kiss last week.\n\nLast night, viewers saw Jean looking forward, and \u2014 with Martin (James Bye) having returned home \u2014 she was hopeful that Stacey would return to the Square soon so that she could inform her about her burgeoning romance with Daniel. However, her world came crashing down moments later when she received a call from Daniel\u2019s neighbour to inform her that Daniel had passed away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter some persuasion, Kush (Davood Ghadami) managed to convince Jean that \u2014 in spite of the short amount of time they knew one another \u2014 it was all right for her to mourn his loss, as he clearly meant a great deal to her. In tonight\u2019s episode, Kush accompanies Jean as she attends a memorial service for Daniel \u2014 which is hosted by his neighbour Mike.\n\nIt\u2019s set to be an incredibly emotional event, as she struggles to come to terms with the loss of her close friend.\n\nEmotions will certainly be running high for Jean, but how will she cope without Daniel?\n\nShe could certainly use support from Stacey right now, that\u2019s for sure.\n\nEastEnders continues on Friday 11th October at 8pm on BBC One.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Daniel's death has a huge impact on Jean", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jean-EastEnders-5f71_1570787696.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
