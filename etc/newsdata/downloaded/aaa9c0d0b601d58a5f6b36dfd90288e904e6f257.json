There is no deadline for those steps. Further, changes in federal personnel policies commonly don\u2019t take effect until OPM later issues guidance to agencies.\n\nLeaders of the two largest federal employee unions, though, said in statements that the rules would remove important protections.\n\n\u201cThese proposed regulations encourage management by fear and intimidation and assume that managers are incapable of working with employees to help them improve their performance,\u201d said American Federation of Government Employees president J. David Cox. \u201cIf these rules go into effect, they will greenlight arbitrary and discriminatory discipline against employees who will have little recourse to challenge poor or politically corrupt management.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith these rules, OPM directs agencies to take the shortest route possible to firing federal workers while at the same time opening the door to favoritism, retaliation and discrimination,\u201d said National Treasury Employees Union president Tony Reardon. \u201cThe proposed regulations minimize the substantive right that employees be given time to improve their performance, and they sacrifice fairness for the sake of expediency.\u201d\n\nHowever, Jason A. Briefel, executive director of the Senior Executives Association, said the changes could help steer the government \u201ctoward a system that focuses on outcomes and resolution instead of leaving things in limbo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have always said there are adequate protections in the law and the regulations, but the whole system has become about the process rather than the outcome for the agency and the public,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on all these rules and regulations rather than managing ourselves as professionals.\u201d\n\nCivil service law requires that before agencies take disciplinary action on performance grounds, employees must be given a notice of their shortcomings and an \u201copportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance.\u201d\n\nPractices vary among agencies; commonly they use \u201cperformance improvement plans,\u201d which may involve additional training, mentoring and heightened monitoring and guidance by supervisors. Some have committed to giving employees a certain amount of time to improve and providing informal help before beginning a formal improvement program.\n\nHowever, the proposed rules say that agencies are not to provide any \u201cadditional performance improvement period or similar informal period\u201d beyond the formal period.\n\nThe rules similarly would discontinue any \u201ctables of penalties\u201d that agencies have created for determining penalties for various types of misconduct, saying that the law does not require such tables and that they can tie management\u2019s hands. They further tell agencies not to follow a practice of \u201cprogressive discipline\u201d \u2014 a series of ever-more-severe penalties.\n\n\u201cThere is no legal principle in the Federal Government that requires agencies to impose the least penalty to rehabilitate an employee. . . . Agencies should not require that an employee have previously been suspended or reduced in pay or grade before a proposing official may propose removal, except as may be appropriate under applicable facts,\u201d the proposed rules say.\n\nAlso when choosing a penalty, agencies would have to consider an employee\u2019s \u201cdisciplinary record and past work record, including all prior misconduct,\u201d not just similar misconduct.\n\nWhile they should consider what was done in a past similar situation in the same work unit and under the same supervisor, \u201cconduct that justifies discipline of one employee at one time by a particular deciding official does not necessarily justify the same or similar disciplinary decision for a different employee at a different time,\u201d the rules proposal says.\n\nWhen actually carrying out a disciplinary action, it adds, agencies should stick as closely as possible to the minimum 30-day delay the law provides for employees to respond to the charges in all but the most serious cases, and to aim to make a final decision within 15 days afterward.\n\nThe rules also would:\n\n\u25cfOrder agencies to use the probationary period for newly hired employees, during which they have very limited rights to contest discipline, \u201cto the greatest extent possible to assess how well they are performing the duties of their jobs; and instances of poor performance and misconduct should be dealt with promptly.\u201d\n\n\u25cfPrevent agencies from consenting, as part of a settlement with an employee who challenged a disciplinary action, to remove any information regarding the employee\u2019s conduct or performance from their personnel files.\n\n\u25cfRequire that agencies take disciplinary action against supervisors who retaliate against whistleblowers, with penalties ranging from a three-day suspension to firing for the first offense and required firing for a second.", "description": "The guidance would strip away many of the practices agencies have followed in disciplining employees while urging them to move as fast as law allows", "authors": ["Eric Yoder", "National Reporter Focusing On Internal Federal Government Personnel", "Management", "Budget Policies", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/U2mzeYZyxq0i4_QqvQHmRtj2nFo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4TF6JAD33AI6TMPTWIZ74WAR54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
