Jordan: Schiff Subpoenaed Fiona Hill After She Already Agreed to Testify", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) subpoenaed U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s former top aide on Russia and Europe, Fiona Hill, to give a behind closed doors deposition in the impeachment probe despite her agreeing to do so voluntarily.\n\nSchiff is the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. The Democrat-led House Committees on Oversight and Reform, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs are leading the impeachment inquiry.\n\nHill, who served in Trump\u2019s National Security Council (NSC) for over two years, had already agreed to testify Monday. Her deposition is currently underway.\n\nBefore Hill\u2019s testimony began, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), the top Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, told reporters:\n\nWe found out just about an hour ago that Chairman Schiff subpoenaed Dr. Hill. She was going to come; she\u2019d agreed to come. She was going to come voluntarily, but he\u2019s going to subpoena her I believe so he can ask certain questions and again keep those secret except for certain things that he wants to leak, the cherry-picked information he wants to leak to the American people.\n\nOn Monday, CBS News revealed that Hill was not planning to provide congressional investigators with documents or texts, possibly prompting Schiff to subpoena her.\n\nThe news outlet pointed out:\n\nCBS News\u2019 Margaret Brennan reports that Hill is expected to tell lawmakers that President Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland actively avoided her and the NSC process and ran their own Ukraine policy, according to a source familiar with Hill. Hill, who is testifying voluntarily, does not intend to hand over documents or texts. She officially left the White House in July, but before the July 25 call between Mr. Trump and [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky took place.\n\nThe former NSC official is testifying despite not knowing much about the July 25 conversation at the center of the impeachment probe.\n\nTrump\u2019s call with Zelensky has embroiled the U.S. president in the unfolding impeachment probe.\n\nAn intelligence community \u201cwhistleblower\u201d accused Trump of leveraging U.S. aid to Ukraine in exchange for it investigating corruption allegations against Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. The \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d accusations triggered the impeachment inquiry. Trump and Zelensky have denied the claims.\n\nJordan and other Republican congressmen who have witnessed the deposition provided by the impeachment inquiry witnesses interviewed so far have lambasted Schiff for keeping the testimonies private. The GOP lawmakers argue that at least one of the statements obliterates the Democrats\u2019 claim that Trump made a quid pro quo offer to his Ukrainian counterpart.\n\nOn Sunday\u2019s broadcast of CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, Schiff defended carrying out the impeachment inquiry behind closed doors.", "description": "Schiff subpoenaed Trump's former aide on Russia, Fiona Hill, to give a private deposition in the impeachment probe despite her already agreeing to do so.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Adam-Schiff-5-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
