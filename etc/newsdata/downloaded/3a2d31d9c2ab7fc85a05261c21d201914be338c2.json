It may turn out to not have been funny, but it was only an offhanded remark.\n\nSome may disagree, but to me, that\u2019s the greatest degree of seriousness to which any joke should be taken. That includes things spoken on a stage.\n\nIt may be undesirable, it may go unappreciated, it may even be offensive; but a joke, generally, is not supposed to have weight.\n\nYet, these days, comedians appear to be getting increasingly crushed for anything objectionable to the most serious among us \u2014 people with a very different idea of a joke than mine.\n\nA telling moment in this new, woke era came Sunday night at The Emmys.\n\nAnd it came from someone who knows a thing or two about offending people, who\u2019s likely said things you don\u2019t appreciate, even though you understand they\u2019re jokes: Sarah Silverman.\n\nOn the red carpet at television\u2019s trophy ceremony, speaking to E! Entertainment, Sarah provided some stunning commentary:\n\n\u201cThey cut us off at the knees. There isn\u2019t even a host anymore at these shows. They don\u2019t want comedians to talk.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you offer to step in,\u201d the interviewer asked?\n\n\u201cNo. Nobody wants to do it, either. I mean, it\u2019s thankless.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\n\nShe\u2019s on the right track there \u2014 from recent memory, Tracy Morgan was shunned, Kevin Hart lost a major opportunity to host (here and here), Dave Chappelle undertook a dismissal by critics (here and here), Norm Macdonald was ejected from The Tonight Show, and an SNL newbie was canned (here). To be clear, I\u2019m not commenting on the tastefulness of anything they said or did; but not long ago, culture was sufficiently free of feigned outrage and virtue-signaling for them to have continued their trajectory unimpeded.\n\nTo borrow from Sarah, as for cutting them off, who\u2019s doing the chopping? Is it the Right?\n\nTwitter had a thing or two to say:\n\nIt\u2019s cancel culture Sarah. From your friends on the left. \u2014 Rocco Santarelli (@satirelli) September 22, 2019\n\nWho is 'they'? Answer: PROGRESSIVES. \u2014 Pradheep J. Shanker (@Neoavatara) September 22, 2019\n\nShe can thank all her crazy buddies for that. \u2014 Liljah (@Lilsisk73) September 23, 2019\n\nHumor not allowed among the woke. \u2014 Desert Girl (@aztraveler1) September 23, 2019\n\nOne tweeter referenced 16-year-old Greta Thunberg, who I covered here:\n\nThe liberals created a Frankenstein monster that's out of control and is attacking everybody, right and left. Oh well, does anyone really need to laugh? Let's all worship Greta Thunberg instead. \u2014 [email protected] (@Guy_Knob) September 23, 2019\n\nSome even blamed Sarah:\n\nDoes she have a mirror handy? I appreciate her saying this tho, but she was a part of the problem. Even tho her \u2018life gives you AIDS, make lemonaids\u2019 joke is one of my favorites. \u2014 Attack Lizard (@MingusYaDingus) September 22, 2019\n\nShe\u2019s one of the biggest contributors to the problem she\u2019s complaining about \u2014 OrangeManBADmKay (@OrangeManBADmK) September 22, 2019\n\nYou've been hoisted on your own petard. Love, Bill Shakespeare. \u2014 Jenny \ud83d\udc3c (@JCEdmund) September 23, 2019\n\nMaynardg referenced Martin Neim\u00f6ller, the anti-Nazi Lutheran pastor who wrote the famous \u201cFirst they came\u2026\u201d\n\nWhen they came for the conservatives, you said nothing\u2026you've been Martin Neimoller'd, babe. \u2014 Maynardg (@maynardg59) September 23, 2019\n\nAnd some users got pretty creative:\n\nShe goes from edgy offensive comedian to a comedy gatekeeper for the Woke Brigade & now she's pissy they turned on her & the rest of the comedians??? pic.twitter.com/igtMAEME5j \u2014 WastelandWanderer (@PsyclonJoker) September 23, 2019\n\nSarah never expected her own cancel culture baby to turn against her. pic.twitter.com/CcQuUW7fh6 \u2014 Danny Borruso (@DannyBorruso) September 23, 2019\n\nOne commenter had a wholly different take:\n\nDon\u2019t want to be preached at so I don\u2019t watch anymore \u2014 Lisa (@Dallas_TXGirl) September 23, 2019\n\nWe\u2019re living in the age of cancellation, and \u2014 so far as I\u2019m concerned \u2014 we\u2019re worse for it.\n\nHow do we go back? It may take a revolution; it may take more than comedians selling themselves as those who\u2019ll say anything and everything yet seeming to conform to all the same political and social points of view.\n\nMaybe we need, from the stage, what those on the Left side of the aisle have hailed time and again, yet haven\u2019t seemed to much appreciate in ways it actually counts: where thoughts are concerned, diversity.\n\nThe world is waiting for it. And so are the laughs.\n\n-ALEX\n\nRelevant RedState links in this article: here, here, here, here, and here\n\nSee 3 more pieces from me:\n\nHow Far Would You Go For A Lost Love?
