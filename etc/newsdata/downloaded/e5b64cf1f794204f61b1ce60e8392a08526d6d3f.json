Today though, we\u2019re looking at best mate Yvie Jones\u2018 Instagram account.\n\nAs picked up by the team over at news.com.au, Yvie is following four of The Bachelorette blokes on IG. That\u2019s Carlin Sterritt, Ciarran Stott, Timm Hanley, and Ryan Anderson. I think it\u2019s safe to say these are the favourites, which adds to the HMM factor in all of this. Sure, Yvie might just be following them \u2018cos they\u2019re mates but surely she, and Channel 10, realise what this looks like. In past seasons, the moment a family member or best friend followed a Bachie contestant on social media, rumoursville went into overdrive.\n\nMeanwhile, Angie is only following Ryan on IG and that makes sense since they already knew each other prior to the show. If you\u2019re a bit foggy on those details, Ryan said he had a bit of \u201cback and forth over social media for a while\u201d with Angie \u201cbut we never actually met in person.\u201d\n\n(the blokes don\u2019t know whether to believe him or not)\n\nBut what does it all mean? I dunno. All four are top contenders, there\u2019s just no doubting it. Would I be surprised if these four end up being Angie\u2019s top four? Absolutely not. And based on how things are going, one of them is definitely Angie\u2019s ~ one ~.\n\nThe Bachelorette continues tonight 7.30pm on Channel 10.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Bachie rejects Tom Bowdidge and Adam Sellars reckon Carlin is the clear frontrunner, closely followed by Timm and Ciarran. No one but Angie is much of a fan of Ryan right now.", "description": "Yvie Jones, Angie Kent's best mate and fellow former Gogglebox star, is casually following four of The Bachelorette boys on Instagram.", "authors": ["Steffanie Tan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-24-at-1.42.02-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
