At a specific time, they scored always twice.\n\n\u201cScore, score. That is the opportunity. Score once, do it again. Use the momentum in the game. Of course we talk about it, of course we want to use that, but you still have to score.\n\n\u201cThe team is a really enthusiastic team. In a good moment, they jump and that\u2019s really good to see.\n\n(Image: Getty Images,)\n\n\"On the other hand, that\u2019s why the two Man City games (in the Champions League quarter-finals) were really special. We dealt with the very difficult circumstances in the two halves here and there on a high level.\n\n\u201cThat brought us to the semis, not that we can score one, two, three in a row. In the moments when we are not in charge of the game, we are still in the game, that\u2019s a very important thing and that helped us massively.\u201d\n\nFebruary 2019, ahead of last season's trip to Old Trafford\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cHe is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, in world football.\n\n\u201cYou can say that with all the things he achieved. Where he started, where he came from and what he did with the club. All that stuff. It\u2019s just incredible.\n\n\u201cAs a young manager \u2013 a couple of years ago I was a young manager \u2013 it\u2019s not allowed to compare yourself or think about what he is doing and then compare to what you\u2019re doing. It was a completely different world. It\u2019s a different job.\n\n\u201cI always admired him. From a distance it\u2019s easy. I\u2019m not sure how it would have been if I was here 20 years at Liverpool and you always have this battle all the time.\n\n(Image: Action Images)\n\nThen maybe it\u2019s different because he was a very competitive guy saying some things before he played against Liverpool.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure when he was in charge he didn\u2019t want us [Liverpool] to be successful.\n\n\"Maybe he doesn\u2019t want that now but the opinion is probably not that strong anymore because he said already a couple of times, I heard, that he likes what we are doing here.\u201d", "description": "The German has always been a keen admirer of the United legend, as he takes his side to Old Trafford this weekend", "authors": ["Mark Jones", "Image", "Getty Images", "Reuters", "Action Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20621455.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MAIN-What-Jurgen-Klopp-said-about-Sir-Alex-Ferguson-as-he-builds-Liverpool-in-his-image.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
