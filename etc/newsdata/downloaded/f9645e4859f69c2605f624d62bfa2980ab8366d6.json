If not, the PM would have to request a three-month extension from the EU.\n\nFurthermore, if the EU demanded a longer extension, the PM would have to accept that within two days, unless MPs objected.\n\nEven if MPs manage to get a new law though Parliament before it is suspended on Monday, that is not the end of the story.\n\nThere is no guarantee the government will abide by it or that the EU will approve another delay without a specific purpose.\n\n5) And meanwhile, across the Channel\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\nThe European Commission is considering allowing EU countries to apply for cash to cope with a no-deal Brexit using a special emergency fund.\n\nOfficials are working on a plan to classify no deal as a \"major disaster\", a category normally used to describe destructive natural events such as earthquakes or major floods.\n\nThe move would require the approval of EU states and the European Parliament.\n\nUnder the proposals being considered by the commission, EU countries would be able to apply for no-deal cash using the EU's solidarity fund.\n\nBBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the plans were expected to be discussed on Monday, and could be formalised at a commission meeting due on Wednesday.", "description": "At the start of a potentially decisive week for Brexit, here are five key things that happened on Monday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1A2A/production/_108589660_mediaitem108589659.jpg"}
