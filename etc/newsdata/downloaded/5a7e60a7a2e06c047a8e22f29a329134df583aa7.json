I do love her to bits as a person and I would never not want her in my life but just as friends.\n\n\"We have too much to lose to ever risk it.\"\n\nChloe is reportedly seeing Adil Rami, an ex of Baywatch babe Pamela Anderson, as the two were snapped in London together.\n\n(Image: Mike Marsland/WireImage)\n\nPete, meanwhile, has been heaping praise on his ex and X Factor Celebrity hopeful Megan McKenna, for her strength following the tragic death of another one of her exes, Mike Thalassitis.\n\nMike took his own life in March, and Megan struggled to come to terms with it.\n\nPete told MailOnline : \"I'm glad she's had a bit of space to deal with everything that has happened. I'm really glad me and her are friends again.\n\n\"She's a really strong person so burying herself in work in the best thing for her and I'm sure her new music is going to be great.\n\n\"I think she has been very, very dignified throughout the whole thing and it just goes to show the strength of character she has got.\"", "description": "Despite fans pleading for the two to get together, Pete has insisted that his relationship with Chloe is just as friends", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Gc Images", "Channel", "Itvbe", "Mike Marsland Wireimage"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20655762.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_London-Celebrity-Sightings-October-17-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
