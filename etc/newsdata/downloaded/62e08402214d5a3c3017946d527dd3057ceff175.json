Fresh data showed that consumers pulled back on spending recently and businesses pulled back on investment, heightening worries about economic growth at a time when two of the biggest global economies remain embroiled in a trade conflict.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell about 1% in recent trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost roughly 150 points, or 0.6%, paring earlier gains of as much as 121 points. The Nasdaq Composite lost 1.6%, as losses accelerated midday.\n\nThe latest swing in stocks came after Bloomberg News reported that Trump administration officials are considering ways to limit U.S. investors' portfolio flows into China. For some, the stock market reaction highlighted how sensitive investors are to developments on trade between the two countries.\n\n\"The market goes through these ebbs and flows depending on the headline of the day,\" said Amy Kong, managing director at Fiduciary Trust Co. International. \"It is going to be like this until they do come to some sort of firm agreement,\" she said of the trade talks.\n\nIt isn't the only headwind for investors. Friday's move has been a continuation of a week marked by some large intraday moves as investors had to navigate both political drama and fresh data on the economy. In addition to trade, investors have been parsing political news from Washington as House Democrats began an impeachment inquiry against President Trump this week. Several investors and analysts said that they didn't expect the impeachment inquiry to have a long-term impact on share prices.\n\nShares of tech companies were some of the hardest hit Friday, while financials stocks outperformed the broader market, continuing a trend from this month. One of the biggest decliners was Micron Technology, which tumbled 11.2% after the company reported late Thursday a decline in sales and earnings in the latest quarter.\n\nWells Fargo shares climbed 3.6% after the San Francisco bank appointed Charles Scharf as chief executive and president. Mr. Scharf is leaving Bank of New York Mellon to succeed C. Allen Parker, interim CEO since Timothy Sloan resigned in late March.\n\nShares of Bank of America added 0.4%, while JPMorgan edged up 0.3%.\n\nInvestors continued to watch for signs of the health of the domestic economy, especially as concerns about wobbling growth world-wide have mounted.\n\nFresh data showed U.S. consumer spending slowed more than expected in August, a sign that a key part of the economy could be losing steam. Meanwhile, one proxy for business investment -- orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft -- declined in August, recording its weakest performance since April, the Commerce Department said. That data highlighted the toll that trade tensions with China could take on the domestic economy. Economists ramped down estimates of third-quarter economic growth after Friday's data.\n\n\"It's all about uncertainty,\" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives of Schwab Center for Financial Research, particularly surrounding trade. \"When you see a slowdown in spending...that does cause concern.\"\n\nPhiladelphia Fed leader Patrick Harker highlighted this in a speech Friday, saying that \"there are clear downside risks, mostly posed by trade and international developments and the uncertainty they breed. It is that uncertainty, more than anything, that is affecting business decisions.\"\n\nHe also said that the Fed should hold firm on rates right now and remained upbeat about the economy.\n\nDespite Friday's move lower for stocks, major indexes remain near record highs.\n\nRecently, individual stocks and sectors have recorded bigger swings, as some investors have sifted through their holdings and increased positions in shares of companies that appear undervalued while shedding some of the big, momentum-driven stocks that have driven the market's gains.\n\nThat was on display on Friday as energy and financials sectors in the S&P 500 outperformed the broader gauge.\n\n\"I think the markets are kind of trading sideways,\" said Adrian Helfert, director of multi-asset portfolios at Westwood Holdings Group. \"I wouldn't expect more appreciation until we see the whites of the eyes of growth.\"\n\nGlobal oil benchmark Brent crude slipped more than 1% after The Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi Arabia moved to impose a partial cease-fire in Yemen. Houthi forces in a surprise move last week declared a unilateral cease-fire in the country.\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.5%, with the U.K.'s FTSE 100 up 1% after a Bank of England official said an interest-rate cut could be needed even if a Brexit deal is reached.\n\nElsewhere, stocks closed broadly lower in Asia, with Tokyo's Nikkei down 0.8% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng down 0.3%. Shares in Shanghai were an outlier, edging up 0.1%.\n\nKaren Langley and and Carlo Martuscelli contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Gunjan Banerji at Gunjan.Banerji@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 27, 2019 15:36 ET (19:36 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
