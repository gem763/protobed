(Sally Chilcott)\n\nBiloela, population 6,000, is a rural town in northeast Australia. When the town\u2019s first \u2014 and only \u2014 set of traffic lights was built 10 years ago, residents were sent into a tizzy. Many families still work in coal mines or cotton farms. On weekends, people fish.\n\nBiloela sits firmly in the voting territory for Australia\u2019s conservative National Party, but the presiding rule, residents say, is that it\u2019s rude to talk about politics. Folks here have little interest in the issues that plague Parliament in Canberra \u2014 that is, until it took away one of their own.\n\nIn this past year, Biloela has campaigned vigorously against Australia\u2019s national government in defense of a Tamil family from Sri Lanka seeking protection against deportation, becoming the unlikely champion of immigration reform along the way.\n\nKokilapathmapriya Nadesalingham and her husband, Nadesalingam Murugappan, who go by Priya and Nades, fled Sri Lanka amid a civil war and settled in Biloela five years ago. After failed attempts at securing the appropriate visas, the couple, along with their two Australian-born daughters, Kopika, 4, and Tharunicaa, 2, were seized by immigration authorities from their home last year and placed in a detention facility under deportation proceedings.\n\nThe case, laced with dramatic turns, has captured the attention of the Australian public.\n\nThe family was seized without warning by the Australian Border Force in a predawn raid last year and flown to a detention facility in Melbourne 1,000 miles away. Last week, they were ushered onto a chartered plane bound for Sri Lanka via Darwin, only to be stopped midway by a last-minute legal injunction that afforded them a few more days in the country. Nades captured some of these experiences on video for advocates to circulate, including one particularly dramatic scene that shows his two daughters in the airplane wailing as their mother is dragged on board.\n\nThe family is now being held in a facility on Christmas Island, an external territory of Australia thousands of miles off the mainland\u2019s west coast, where they are the only detainees, BuzzFeed News reported.\n\nSince the plane incident, calls for the government to stop the deportation of the family have intensified, with thousands of people gathering for protests held across the country over the weekend. At the center of these efforts is Biloela, where friends, neighbors and strangers have worked for a year to get the family home, forming an online movement under the banner \u201c#HomeToBilo.\"\n\nResidents have turned out at vigils in force. Some have traveled hours to Melbourne to visit the family in detention. Last year, Margot Plant and Marie Austin, two grandmothers and longtime residents of the town, flew to Sydney for the chance to ask panelists on a question-and-answer television show to help with the case.\n\n\u201cThe emotional swing that has occurred in this community has been extraordinary,\u201d Angela Fredericks, a Biloela resident and friend of the family, told the Guardian on Saturday. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a rage like that in Biloela. We\u2019re a polite town.\u201d\n\nIn the four years they spent in Biloela, the Tamil family had become a core part of the community, advocates say. Nades worked at the local abattoir and volunteered at a welfare services society, St. Vincent de Paul. Priya, the Guardian reported, often cooked for staff at the hospital.\n\n[Daily News Quiz: An act of kindness during Hurricane Dorian]\n\nSimone Cameron, an organizer of the advocacy efforts who grew up in Biloela, said she has been surprised by the outpouring of support from her hometown.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very politically conservative town; that\u2019s not debatable,\u201d she told The Washington Post. \u201cGrowing up, I had never ever been to a protest or to a vigil about anything political.\u201d\n\n\n\nA Biloela boy speaks at the vigil last week. (Sally Chilcott)\n\n\u201cEven now, I think people are not thinking about it as global issues or politics,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s a story about a family and a town that wants them back.\u201d\n\nOutside of Biloela, the case has won over unlikely supporters such as Alan Jones, a conservative radio broadcaster who more often makes headlines for dropping the n-word on air or verbally attacking New Zealand\u2019s liberal prime minister, Jacinda Ardern.\n\n\u201cI find the government\u2019s behavior on this, and that of [Minister for Home Affairs] Peter Dutton, beyond disgraceful,\u201d Jones said on his program this week, adding that he has written personally to the prime minister \u201cfor a bit of practical Christianity.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, a federal court extended the injunction delaying the deportation of the family to Friday afternoon.\n\nDutton, the Home Affairs minister, has repeatedly rejected appeals for him to exercise the ministerial powers that allow him to grant visas to anyone regardless of whether they have a justifiable case for asylum. Some advocates fear that he wants to make an example of Priya and Nades, citing the argument that Atlantic writer Adam Serwer used in 2018 to describe the immigration crisis in the United States: \u201cThe cruelty is the point.\u201d\n\nBut the family\u2019s allies in Biloela are not giving up just yet, Cameron said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been met with absolute silence for months, but we\u2019ve found these stubborn reserves to keep pushing and pushing,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we want, really, is to bring our friends home.\u201d\n\n\n\nPriya and Nades face deportation, along with their two Australian-born daughters, ages 4 and 2.
