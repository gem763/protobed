Breaking down the complicated songwriter drama.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cTruth Hurts\u201d and its empowering message recently came under scrutiny after a pair of songwriting brothers claimed they deserve to be credited as writers on the chart-topping track. The line at the center of their complaint is, at this point, virtually synonymous with Lizzo, who reportedly filed to trademark the phrase and already features it on T-shirts sold on her website: \u201cI just took a DNA test, turns out I\u2019m 100 percent that b----.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn her tweet, Lizzo reiterated that she came across the phrase in a meme, acknowledging that she saw it \u201cin 2017, while working on a demo\u201d \u2014 presumably the unreleased track at the center of the dispute. As outlined in a New York Times article last week, songwriters Justin and Jeremiah Raisen argue that they should have received writing credits on \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d because a variation of its signature line first appeared in \u201cHealthy,\u201d a demo they worked on with Lizzo and two other songwriters in an April 2017 studio session.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI saw a meme that resonated with me, a meme that made me feel like 100% that b----,\u201d Lizzo wrote. \u201cI sang that line in the demo and I later used the line in Truth Hurts.\u201d\n\nFrom there, her story and that of the Raisen brothers diverge. The brothers have argued that Lizzo\u2019s delivery of the line in question is virtually the same in \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d as it is in \u201cHealthy.\u201d But Lizzo strongly rejected that claim, tweeting: \u201cThe men who now claim a piece of Truth Hurts did not help me write any part of the song. They had nothing to do with the line or how I chose to sing it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHowever, Lizzo did note in her tweet Wednesday that she was \u201csharing my success\u201d with the presumed creator of the meme in question, British singer Mina Lioness, who tweeted \u201cI did a DNA test and found out I\u2019m 100% that b----\u201d in February 2017 and had publicly called Lizzo out for co-opting the line. Lioness seemed to react to Lizzo\u2019s new tweet with a spin on her own viral quip: \u201cI just took a DNA Test, turns out I\u2019m a credited writer for the number one song on Billboard.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAfter the brothers raised the issue of songwriting credits in recent Instagram posts, Cynthia S. Arato, a lawyer for Lizzo, told the Times in a statement last week that the Raisens \u201cdid not collaborate with Lizzo or anyone else\u201d on \u201cTruth Hurts.\u201d The statement also asserted that the Raisens \u201crenounced any claim to the work, in writing, months ago.\u201d\n\nSongwriting disputes have a long legacy and can be notoriously fraught \u2014 as shown by recent high-profile copyright cases involving Robin Thicke\u2019s controversial megahit \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d and Katy Perry\u2019s \u201cDark Horse.\u201d The dispute over \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d is somewhat unusual, at least to industry outsiders, because it alleges that \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d borrowed from an unreleased song. And then there\u2019s the debate around the origins of the \u201cDNA test\u201d lyric, which some have said walks the line between inspiration and plagiarism.\n\nAD\n\nIn an interview last week with The Washington Post, veteran songwriter Justin Raisen said he never \u201cknowingly signed away my rights or claims\u201d but believes the statement from Arato refers to exasperated emails he and his brother sent after months of unsuccessful appeals to Lizzo\u2019s team and producer Ricky Reed, who signed the singer to his Atlantic Records imprint, Nice Life, in 2016. On Instagram, the brothers noted they had \u201ctried to sort this out quietly for the last two years,\u201d beginning in September 2017 when Justin Raisen observed, in an email to his management company, that \u201cyou can literally sing \u2018Healthy\u2019 over the entirety of \u2018Truth Hurts.\u2019 \u201d In January 2018, long before \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d entered the Hot 100, the Raisens\u2019 publisher put the song in dispute \u2014 essentially stalling the profits for its credited songwriters.\n\nAD\n\nDuring the April writing session, Justin Raisen recalled, Lizzo landed on a beat produced by Jeremiah called \u201cHealthy.\u201d The songwriters took to the Internet, absent-mindedly scrolling through memes about health and wellness. One stumbled across a phrase that Jeremiah Raisen insisted would be perfect for the track.\n\nThe Raisens\u2019 recent Instagram posts invite social media users to be the judge, juxtaposing the \u201cDNA test\u201d line in the \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d single with the line as Lizzo belted it on the \u201cHealthy\u201d demo: \u201cI just did a DNA test, turns out I\u2019m 100 percent that b----.\u201d The final frame of the video plays both song snippets simultaneously.\n\nAD\n\nThe \u201cDNA test\u201d line added an extra layer to the drama. Tweets are entitled to copyright protection \u201cto the extent that what\u2019s being tweeted constitutes an original work of authorship,\u201d said Lisa Alter, a copyright lawyer not involved in the Lizzo dispute. But proving copyright infringement could be tough on a platform where users are often inclined to make the same jokes. Even if an expert found the tweet to be an original work, an artist could rely on a fair use defense, which can get complicated. \u201cThe courts are all over the place in evaluating\u201d such cases, Alter said.\n\nAD\n\nIf the Raisens had merely suggested using the \u201cDNA test\u201d line they had seen in a meme, they probably would not have a copyright infringement case, Alter said, noting \u201can idea itself is not copyright.\u201d But the Raisens say their contribution went beyond that, and hired a musicologist to attest as much in a recent report that said \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d borrowed both lyrical and melodic elements from \u201cHealthy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe duplication of these distinctive elements in \u2018Truth\u2019 makes it difficult to argue that these similarities are the result of coincidence or that \u2018Truth\u2019 was independently created and did not copy these elements from \u2018Healthy,' \u201d the report stated, ultimately concluding that \"\u2018Truth Hurts\u2019 would not exist in its present form without the existence of and the borrowing from \u2018Healthy.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nJustin Raisen, who called Lizzo \u201cone of the most talented people\u201d he has ever worked with, said it\u2019s in that spirit that he, his brother and another songwriter in the room \u2014 all recruited to collaborate with Lizzo \u2014 should be credited on \u201cTruth Hurts;\u201d he and his brother have each asked for 5 percent of the songwriting royalties. In addition to the meme-inspired lyric, the song\u2019s \u201cmelody was written over the beat that we came up with,\u201d Justin Raisen said.\n\nAD\n\nA similar \u2014 though less detailed \u2014 claim surfaced earlier this year when Ariana Grande released \u201cThank U, Next,\u201d the album she recorded following her very public split with \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d comic Pete Davidson and the sudden death of rapper Mac Miller, her ex-boyfriend. She has recounted how a group of girlfriends \u2014 including several songwriters \u2014 rallied around her in the studio, leading to the Tiffany\u2019s shopping trip that inspired \u201c7 Rings.\u201d\n\nAs eagle-eyed fans noted the morning of the album\u2019s release, one \u201c7 Rings\u201d writer and ring recipient, Kimberly \u201cKaydence\u201d Krysiuk, implied on Instagram that she should have received writing credits for additional songs. In a snappy, thinly veiled response, Victoria Mon\u00e9t, one of Grande\u2019s closest collaborators, wondered if the singer\u2019s dogs should also receive writing credits because \u201cthey were in the room too.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s a dilemma that bands have long grappled with: What constitutes songwriting? And what passes for meaningful collaboration in a room full of people bringing different talents and skills to the table in the hope that they produce a song that resonates?\n\nAD\n\nNot surprisingly, Alter recommends songwriters sign a contract to make terms clear. But she said it rarely happens.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a thing that songwriters who collaborate like to do because they\u2019re all good buddies,\u201d Alter said. \u201cEvery time we talk to young songwriters we say, \u2018If you want to stay good friends, then you better write this down, because otherwise it could become an issue.\u2019 And there goes everything.\"\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this report incorrectly stated that Lizzo's producer, Ricky Reed, was at the writing session that produced \"Healthy.\" The article has been updated.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "A dispute between the breakout singer and two collaborators has prompted debate about what constitutes songwriting.", "authors": ["Bethonie Butler", "Reporter Covering Television", "Pop Culture"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/n8M21fgw2TC1jH1uivFSB4x3ANQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/INT5D7XQH4I6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
