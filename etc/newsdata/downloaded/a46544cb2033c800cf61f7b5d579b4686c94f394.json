Two men, brothers from the upper-caste Yadav community, have been arrested on suspicion of murder.\n\nThe attack took place at around 6.30am on Wednesday in the village of Bhavkhedi, Madhya Pradesh state, at almost the precise moment when - 7,500 miles away in New York - India\u2019s prime minister Narendra Modi was being honoured by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for his work to eliminate open defecation.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The case is being treated as a possible violation of laws designed to protect Dalits and other caste and tribal communities subjected to discrimination.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The study concluded that as much as 44 per cent of the rural population across four states \u201cstill defecate in the open\u201d.\n\nDuring Tuesday night\u2019s event with Mr Modi in New York, at which the prime minister was given one of four 2019 Global Goalkeeper Awards, Bill Gates admitted that \u201cmanaging human waste is one of the world's oldest and toughest challenges\u201d, before saying India\u2019s efforts could be a \u201cmodel\u201d for other to follow.\n\n\u201cI would say most leaders are not willing to talk about [sanitation], in part, because the solutions aren't that easy,\u201d he said.", "description": "Two children have been beaten to death in India after they were seen defecating in the open near a village council building, police say.
