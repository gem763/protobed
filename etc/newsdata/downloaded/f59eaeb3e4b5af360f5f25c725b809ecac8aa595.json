He faces a maximum federal prison sentence of 15 years. | AP Photo Donor who gave $900K to Trump inaugural to plead guilty to illegal contributions\n\nOAKLAND \u2014 A California investor who donated cumulative millions to political campaigns and President Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural committee has agreed to plead guilty to making illegal contributions and failing to disclose his lobbying work as a foreign agent.\n\nIn a plea agreement and related documents unveiled by federal prosecutors on Tuesday, Imaad Shah Zuberi acknowledged that he promised international clients and representatives of foreign governments that he would be able to mold U.S. foreign policy in ways that would generate profit. He used his venture capital firm Avenue Ventures to generate millions in revenues, much of which he kept for his personal benefit.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cMr. Zuberi\u2019s multi-faceted scheme allowed him to line his pockets by concealing the fact that he was representing foreign clients, obtaining access for clients by making a long series of illegal contributions, and skimming money paid by his clients,\u201d United States Attorney Nick Hanna said in a statement.\n\nSome of the money Zuberi raised through those promises he channeled into political campaigns, federal prosecutors charge: more than $3 million to Democratic and Republican candidates, including $900,000 to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. Prosecutors said Zuberi funneled money from his clients through his company and into political campaigns in an effort to obscure the provenance of those funds.\n\nWhile Zuberi has drawn attention for his substantial donation to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, he has a history of supporting candidates of both parties. Last campaign cycle, recipients have included Arizona Democrat Kyrsten Sinema, multiple California Democrats in House races and Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and Rand Paul.\n\nThe documents released Tuesday do not specify which donations in particular were allegedly illegal.\n\nContributions in turn bought Zuberi \u201caccess to high-level foreign officials,\u201d a charging document states. Although prosecutors say the results were mostly \u201cmarginal,\u201d they note that some officials did agree to conform to Zuberi\u2019s \u201cpolitical positions\u201d or comply with his \u201cwishes.\u201d\n\nAmong the foreign nationals and representatives Zuberi retained as clients were citizens of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Venezuela, prosecutors said, in addition to Sri Lankan government officials seeking to refurbish the country\u2019s tarnished reputation following a campaign against Tamil dissidents.\n\nZuberi, 49, agreed to plead guilty to one count of making nearly $1 million in illegal campaign contributions, which included using foreign funds to influence U.S. elections. He also agreed to plead guilty to one count of tax evasion and one count of falsifying records to hide his lobbying work.\n\nZuberi is expected to appear in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Oct. 30. He faces a maximum federal prison sentence of 15 years.", "description": "Imaad Shah Zuberi promised international clients that he would be able to mold U.S. foreign policy in ways that would generate profit.", "authors": ["Jeremy B.
