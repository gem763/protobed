Now, Bitcoin has entered the mainstream, frequenting the headlines of mainstream media outlets and becoming a part of the world\u2019s vernacular.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Humble Origins\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an easy journey, however. Back during Bitcoin\u2019s earliest years, it was often ridiculed by cynics who claimed that the project was nothing more than a currency for criminals. What\u2019s more, no one really attributed value to the coins.\n\nRelated Reading: More Whales Are Hoarding Bitcoin After Accumulating During Bear Market\n\nBut, this changed seemingly for the first time in 2010, when early adopter Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 BTC for some pizza. Many have argued that this is the first time that BTC was assigned an actual dollar value. eToro\u2019s Mati Greenspan has even said that without that one transaction, the industry wouldn\u2019t be where it is today.\n\nAccording to Saifedean Ammous, an economics professor and the author of industry primer \u201cThe Bitcoin Standard,\u201d it wasn\u2019t Laszlo who first imbued BTC with value against fiat, it was someone else.\n\nTen years ago today, 5,050 btc were sold for $5.02 in the first market transaction for bitcoin. Today, they'd be worth $42,171,792.50. A rise of 838,078,685%. https://t.co/yCvJ9TrrSn \u2014 Saifedean Ammous (@saifedean) October 12, 2019\n\nAmmous remarked in a recent tweet that ten years ago to this day, someone purchased 5,050 Bitcoin for $5.02 in the \u201cfirst market transaction for BTC\u201d. Today, that same sum of coins is worth some $42 million.\n\nAs the professor noted, this implies that from its first sale, Bitcoin has rallied some 838,078,685% until now. Crazy.\n\nPrice Has Room to Run\n\nWhile 838 million percent is obviously ludicrous, especially considering that this appreciation took place within a ten-year time period, some say that Bitcoin still has room to run. A lot more room.\n\nPer previous reports from NewsBTC, former Goldman Sachs executive Raoul Pal said that Bitcoin is still \u201cvery cheap\u201d from a \u201clonger-term time horizon\u201d perspective. Pal has previously argued that TC is the only asset that makes sense for Millenials and younger demographics because everything else is overvalued.\n\nThe prominent markets analyst has also stated that a recession is likely to be extremely bullish for bonds, dollars, diamonds, and Bitcoin.\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "Since its birth in 2009, Bitcoin has been on a remarkable run.
