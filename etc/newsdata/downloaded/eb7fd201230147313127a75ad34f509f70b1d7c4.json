Brandon Belt had three hits including two doubles for the Giants, who lead the majors with five 1-0 wins.\n\nThe Marlins got another solid start from Sandy Alcantara (5-13), who struck out six, walked none and gave up nine hits and one run in seven innings.\n\nMiami has lost five straight and seven of eight and is 10-33 since July 30.\n\nTyler Rogers and Shawn Anderson combined for 2 2/3 innings to complete the four-hitter. Anderson pitched around Curtis Granderson\u2019s pinch-hit single leading off the ninth to convert his second save.\n\nIn the sixth, Posey punched a single through the hole on the left side of a drawn-in infield, scoring Stephen Vogt from third with one out. Vogt doubled leading off the inning and went to third on Kevin Pillar\u2019s grounder to first.\n\nVogt, a catcher by trade playing left field for San Francisco, made a nice running catch in the gap on Miguel Rojas\u2019 line drive leading off the fourth.\n\nPosey was batting sixth for the first time this season.\n\nAlcantara hadn\u2019t allowed a run for 14 straight innings before the Giants broke through. The right-hander threw a shutout against Kansas City in his most recent start on Sunday.\n\nThe Marlins failed to get a runner into scoring position.\n\nTheir best chance was in the seventh, when Magneuris Sierra singled leading off the inning, but he was thrown out trying to steal second. Sierra was originally ruled safe, but the call was overturned on a replay challenge.\n\nBOSTON BUZZ\n\nNext week\u2019s series at Boston has generated some buzz, with outfielder Mike Yastrzemski returning to the city where his Hall of Fame grandfather Carl Yastrzemski remains a legend.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought about it, only because I\u2019ve had a lot of calls about it,\u201d Giants manager Bruce Bochy said, acknowledging that he\u2019s frequently been asked, \u201cAm I going to put him in left?\u201d where Yastrzemski\u2019s grandfather played.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty cool I\u2019m sure for him and his granddad,\u201d Bochy said. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be fun for the fans. It\u2019s a big name there, so it\u2019s going to be exciting.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nMarlins: OF Garrett Cooper left the game after making a sliding catch of Yastrzemski\u2019s flyball in the bottom of the first. He\u2019s day-to-day with a left knee contusion.\n\nGiants: LHP Will Smith (back tightness) was expected to throw on flat ground Friday. The All-Star closer probably won\u2019t pitch until Tuesday, when San Francisco opens the series at Boston, Bochy said. \u2026 OF Alex Dickerson (right oblique strain) was scheduled to hit curveballs in the cage off a machine after taking batting practice Friday and will run bases on Saturday. He could be ready for the Boston series, Bochy said. \u2026 Jalen Davis (left wrist contusion) is day-to-day;\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMarlins: RHP Robert Dugger (0-2, 2.49 ERA) will make his fifth career start, seeking his first win despite several strong outings. The 23-year-old has a 2.25 ERA over his last three starts.\n\nGiants: LHP Madison Bumgarner (9-8, 3.77) is 2-4 with a 4.73 ERA in nine career starts against Miami.\n\n__\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tyler Beede allowed three hits in 6 1/3 innings, Buster Posey drove in the game's only run, and the San Francisco Giants beat the Miami Marlins 1-0 on Friday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gideon Rubin"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/14/marlins_giants_baseball_26897_c0-166-3960-2474_s1770x1032.jpg?e4fb9f09fe3cad1a75f791d2507dd52c555a5352", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
