More concretely, the idea that things are not getting worse on this front is reason enough to buy stocks and sell bonds.\n\nBut scepticism remains that this latest agreement doesn\u2019t represent much more than a truce in a conflict that has smashed business confidence around the world and driven the global manufacturing sector into recession. What's more, the details of the deal have largely been pre-announced and could be quickly reversed.\n\nNegotiations around issues of technology transfer, intellectual property rules and China\u2019s management of its currency await.\n\nThe consensus is that those talks present more existential challenges to the Chinese industrial model and are likely to prove intractable. The blacklisting of eight more Chinese tech companies only days before last Friday's \"deal\" suggests the tech war continues to escalate.\n\n\"We maintain our view that the US-China trade war will last indefinitely,\" Bank of America-Merrill Lynch global economists said.\n\nSet against that scepticism and indeed pessimism on trade is last Thursday's meeting between the British and Irish prime ministers, which analysts believe may have signalled the beginning of the end of the UK's divorce from Europe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe two leaders seem to have found a plausible solution to the intractable Irish \"backstop\" issue which has bedevilled the Brexit negotiations. The solution would allow for open Irish borders and a UK exit from the EU customs union.\n\nIndeed, following this encounter, analysts at JPMorgan lifted their estimated chance of an exit agreement by October 31 to 50 per cent from a mere 5 per cent.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, a UK exit from the EU on the basis of a withdrawal agreement within a matter of weeks now looks the single most likely path ahead,\u201d the bank\u2019s Brexit analyst, Malcolm Barr, said.\n\nNo wonder the pound enjoyed a 3.6 per cent surge over the two days leading into the apparent breakthrough: its biggest two-day gain since December 2008. All of this may yet prove another false start, but it is a rare glimpse of an exit.\n\nAll up, though, there are enough reasons for investors to expect heightened uncertainty to remain the status quo.\n\nJPMorgan's manufacturing expectations index suggests global capital expenditure should continue to slide in coming quarters. The US earnings season, which begins this week, should be a challenging one.\n\nAnd Trump, that great disrupter, is tweeting more rather than less, and with greater impact.\n\nThe former reality TV celebrity\u2019s tweet rate has, in the words of AMP Capital\u2019s Shane Oliver, \u201cgone through the roof\u201d, clocking in at 797 posts in September or close to 27 a day.\n\nWhile not are all are market-moving, enough are. JPMorgan analysis shows that Trump's tweets are having an increasing effect on bond markets, where volatility has climbed sharply in recent weeks.\n\nTrump giving up social media is less likely than a Brexit and the trade war being resolved tomorrow.", "description": "Investors are happy to buy into hopes of a resolution to two of the most intractable global uncertainties - Brexit and the trade wars - but scepticism remains that the latest agreement doesn\u2019t represent much more than a truce in a conflict which has smashed business confidence around the world.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3449%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_12/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c837c31be360e3d01940cd05916492825a6e2db2", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
