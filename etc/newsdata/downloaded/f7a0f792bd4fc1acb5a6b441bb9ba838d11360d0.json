The Dems have been doing everything behind closed doors and in secret and so it\u2019s about time somebody made a very bold stand, which is I guess a sit-in, which is what they did. And it was great, and the point was well taken,\" Grisham said on \"Fox & Friends\" when asked about the display.\n\n\"I think they showed full support for the president,\" she added. \"He was happy to see it happen. He was very supportive of it, as he should be.\"\n\nTrump in a later tweet thanked House Republicans for \"being tough, smart, and understanding in detail the greatest Witch Hunt in American History.\"\n\n\"It has been going on since long before I even got Elected (the Insurance Policy!). A total Scam!\" he added.\n\nThank you to House Republicans for being tough, smart, and understanding in detail the greatest Witch Hunt in American History. It has been going on since long before I even got Elected (the Insurance Policy!). A total Scam! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 24, 2019\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA few dozen House Republicans caused chaos on Capitol Hill on Wednesday when they stormed a room being used to hold closed-door testimony from an administration official as part of an impeachment inquiry into Trump. The lawmakers said they were protesting the lack of transparency from Democrats leading the investigation.\n\nSome of the Republicans who barged into the hearing room were in possession of cellphones, a violation of the rules governing the sensitive compartmented information facility (SCIF), where the depositions have been taking place.\n\nOne lawmaker posted audio of a phone call he made from the room.\n\nThe stunt drew rebukes from Democrats and former intelligence community officials, who argued it impugned the integrity of the process and violated security protocols.\n\nBut the move pleased Trump, who has in recent days publicly called for Republicans to get tougher in defending him against impeachment. He was reportedly informed of the plan to storm the SCIF before it happened.\n\n\u201cRepublicans have to get tougher and fight,\u201d Trump said during a Cabinet meeting on Monday. \u201cWe have some that are great fighters, but they have to get tougher and fight because the Democrats are trying to hurt the Republican Party for the election.\u201d\n\n--This report was updated at 10:37 a.m.", "description": "President Trump was happy to see House Republicans storm a closed-door\u00a0hearing\u00a0in protest of House Democrats' impeachment inquiry, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/impeachment_scif_phones_house_gop_102319gn_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
