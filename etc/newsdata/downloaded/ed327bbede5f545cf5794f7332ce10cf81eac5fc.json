The inflation figures used are for the year to September, due to be announced in the next few weeks.\n\nPensions firm Aegon said the current rate of wage growth means payouts can be expected to increase by 4pc from April next year. This would bring payments for someone with a full national insurance record to \u00a3175.35 a week.\n\nSince 2010, the amount received from the state by a single person has grown by almost a third. The expected rise would be the highest since 2012, when inflation was 5.2pc.\n\nSteve Cameron, from Aegon, said: \u201cThis will be welcome news for current state pensioners. However, these inflation busting increases do come at a significant cost.", "description": "Retirees in receipt of the state pension are in line for a 4pc boost in payouts next year thanks to the Government\u2019s gold-plated protections.", "authors": ["Sam Meadows", "Matthew Lynn", "Sam Barker", "Katie Morley", "Lauren Davidson", "Marianna Hunt", "Taha Lokhandwala", "Stephanie Baxter"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/pensions-retirement/2019/07/30/Raining_money_coins_clouds_sky-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-07-30"}
