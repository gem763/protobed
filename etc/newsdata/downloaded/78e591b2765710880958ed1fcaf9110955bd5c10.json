It included housing for workers, schools, parks, hospitals and boulevards, but no places of worship in line with the atheism of the Communist bloc.\n\nThe town grew rapidly, and within a few years of its founding, it had over 100,000 residents; the steel works employed 40,000 workers at its peak. But Nova Huta also saw its share of political tension, and in the 1950s and 1960s, protests erupted in support of the building of a Catholic church.\n\nIn 1988, the steelworks saw strikes, which did much to undermine the Communist leadership and bring about the introduction of democracy in Poland. The town\u2019s economy has struggled in recent years as the fortunes of the steel mill have waned.\n\n\u2014 Charlie Duxbury\n\nAuthors:", "description": "In the easternmost district of Krak\u00f3w, an idealist vision from the 40s faces modern reality.", "authors": ["Omar Marques"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/poland03_355x267-1067x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
