As for her family connections, \u201cI was certainly aware that the other Murdochs are conservative,\u201d the founder of the climate initiative, Ira Magaziner, said, but \u201cit didn\u2019t matter.\u201d At the time, he noted, many Republicans, including Mitt Romney, had spoken about the need to deal with climate change.\n\nOver the years, she has worked with organizations whose approaches to environmental action align with her own. She joined the board of the Environmental Defense Fund, a group that often collaborates with industry on climate issues. In 2014 she and her husband created the Quadrivium Foundation (the word means \u201ccrossroads\u201d) to fund their programs. One of those is SciLine, an independent nonprofit service that connects reporters with scientists and provides fact sheets on topics in the news like a primer in August on hurricanes and climate change.\n\nShe decided, however, that spreading scientific knowledge might not be enough. People already understand that the planet is warming and that humans are the cause. The deeper problem, she said, is that the government of the United States isn\u2019t doing anything about it.\n\nShe took a deep dive into possible solutions to partisan deadlock and reviewed the players in the diffuse field known as democracy reform: Small groups that push for changes in the electoral system.\n\nSome of the avenues her groups are pursuing include ranked-choice voting, in which voters rank candidates in order of their preference. Proponents of this method argue that it reduces the tendency of primaries to reward candidates who work mainly to energize their base, and favors candidates who have the broadest appeal. She is also interested in initiatives to restrict gerrymandering and increase access to voting through proposals like automatic registration, as well as open primaries, in which voters do not need to declare their party affiliation.\n\nCharles Wheelan, founder of Unite America, said that because of Ms. Murdoch\u2019s surname, \u201cit\u2019s fair to say that in some quarters our relationship raises a few eyebrows.\u201d But he also calls her \u201can important ambassador\u201d to the wealthy and powerful, someone who can tell them, as a peer: \u201cLook, if you really want to make the world better for your grandchildren, fix politics.\u201d", "description": "You know her last name, and her father-in-law, Rupert, the conservative media mogul.
