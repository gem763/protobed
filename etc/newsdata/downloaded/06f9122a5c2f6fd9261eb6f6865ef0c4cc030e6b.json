An animal reportedly walked into the road, and the family took a detour around it.\n\nThey were stopped that night by an American officer, who told them they crossed into the U.S., the Washington Post reported.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to a complaint filed by the family Friday to the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security, this was when their trip became \u201cthe scariest experience of our lives.\" Eileen Connors, one of the mothers on the trip, alleges that she and the rest of her family, including her 3-month-old son, have been detained at the Berks Family Residential Center in Leesport, Pa., for more than a week in \u201cfrigid\u201d and \u201cfilthy\u201d conditions.\n\nConnors said when the family was initially stopped in Washington state, her husband and his cousin were arrested. She alleges that they were not read their rights and she and her baby were placed in \u201ca very cold cell\u201d at a Border Patrol station. The family\u2019s attorney told the Post that the cells are nicknamed \u201cHieleras\u201d or \u201ciceboxes\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will never forget, we will be traumatized for the rest of our lives by what the United States government has done to us,\u201d Connors wrote in a sworn statement, later adding, \u201cWe have been treated like criminals here, stripped of our rights, and lied to. \u2026 It is undoubtedly the worst experience we have ever lived through.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe officers left us in the cell the entire day, with no information, no call to our family back home, no idea when we would be free to leave,\u201d she continued.\n\nAfter reportedly spending the night in the cell with \u201cmetal-like, thin emergency blankets,\u201d authorities told the family they could be released from detention if they provided the contact information for a family member living in the U.S.\n\nA relative with U.S. citizenship tried to help, but the family was later informed that there was \u201ca change in plans.\u201d\n\nThe family alleges that they were then taken to a van in \u201cwhat felt like an abduction or kidnapping.\u201d David Connors, Eileen Connors\u2019s husband, was taken to the Tacoma Northwest Detention Center. Eileen Connors and the 3-month-old baby were taken to a Red Roof Inn in Seattle.\n\nWhen they were taken to the Seattle airport the next day, Connors wrote that she thought \u201cfinally we\u2019re going home.\u201d But the family landed in Pennsylvania and taken to the Berks Family Residential Center, a facility some advocates have called \u201cbaby jail,\u201d the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.\n\nThe other couple and their 2-year-old twins were also taken to Berks, according to the family\u2019s attorney.\n\nConnors alleges that she had to bathe her son on a couch using a washcloth because he was too small for the facility\u2019s showers. She said the bathtub he was given was \u201cfilthy dirty and had broken bits,\u201d and her son was left without clothing, blankets or bibs because the center\u2019s staff took the items to be washed.\n\n\u201cThe blankets and sheets in our room have a disgusting smell, like a dead dog,\u201d Connors wrote. \u201cI cannot use them to wrap up my baby for fear they haven\u2019t been washed properly and my baby will become sick.\u201d\n\nConnors said her on woke up Friday with his left eye \u201cswollen and teary\u201d and his skin was \u201crough and blotchy.\u201d Officials at the center said the child could be taken from the center, but he would be separated from his parents.\n\nThe Connors also claim that the were not given the opportunity to call their embassy. In her statement, Connors said officials only told her the British embassy tried to contact her family on October 7, but the staff did not tell the family until it was too late in the day to call.\n\nAs of late Monday, the British family was still waiting to be deported, an attorney told The Washington Post. The attorney said the family was hoping to leave as soon as Tuesday.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) disputed the family\u2019s claims of mistreatment to the Post.\n\nThe Hill has reached out to ICE for comment.", "description": "A British family has spent days detained in multiple locations across the U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/ice_immigration_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
