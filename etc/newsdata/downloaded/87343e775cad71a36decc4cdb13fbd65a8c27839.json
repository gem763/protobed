The Kentucky Republican says that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is \u201cin the clutches of a left-wing mob that finally convinced her to impeach the president.\u201d\n\nLooking to capitalize on the polarizing issue, McConnell makes a fundraising plea at the end of the video, saying: \u201cI need your help. Please contribute before the deadline.\u201d\n\nMcConnell is running for reelection next year and regularly plays up his ties to Trump, who easily carried Kentucky in 2016 and remains popular in the state.\n\nMcConnell campaign manager Kevin Golden said the impeachment inquiry has fired up the senator\u2019s supporters.\n\n\u201cFew issues energize conservative voters like liberal overreach and the Democrats\u2019 latest outrageous attempt to impeach President Trump has activated our base to new heights,\u201d Golden said in a statement Saturday night.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "\"All of you know your Constitution,\" Mitch McConnell says in the video. \"The way that impeachment stops is with a Senate majority with me as majority leader.\"", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bruce Schreiner"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/03/congress_gun_control_93659_c0-402-5187-3426_s1770x1032.jpg?0e44ec61a958c5fd7d55df57e290cd7bd99b926e", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
