On Sept. 24, drought first presented itself in the region but was patchy.\n\nThe drought has expanded as rain opportunities have dissolved. Washington\u2019s rainfall since the start of September, 0.27 inches, ranks as the second least on record.\n\nRainfall has been abnormally scarce since mid-July, when dry conditions commenced:\n\n0.79 inches of rain fell in the second half of July, about an inch below normal\n\n1.99 inches fell in August, 0.94 inches below normal\n\n0.25 inches fell in September, 3.47 inches below normal\n\n0.02 has fallen so far October, 1.08 inches below normal\n\nIn sum, Washington has racked up a rainfall deficit of about 6.5 inches since mid-July, the equivalent of missing two months\u2019 worth of rain.\n\nBecause it was so wet before mid-July, the lack of rainfall through the end of August was inconsequential.\n\nBut in September, the drought came on suddenly. In early September, there was still no drought in the region before it spread over most of the area by the end of the month, aided by abnormally high temperatures. Because of the haste at which the drought developed, it has been termed a \u201cflash drought.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe short-term dryness and heat quickly overcame the long-term record wetness we experienced between April 2018 and the early summer of 2019,\u201d explained the National Weather Service office serving the Washington-Baltimore region in its drought statement released Tuesday. \u201cAlthough the heat has ended, significant rain has not yet been observed, so drought conditions persist.\u201d\n\nThe forecast for the next week offers little promise for substantial rainfall. A chance of light rain showers is in the forecast for late Sunday and next Wednesday. Otherwise, dry conditions are predicted.\n\nThe Weather Service statement said \u201cimpacts have been quickly building\u201d from the drought. \u201cThe earliest impact was to lawns and gardens, which browned and growing has ceased,\u201d it said.\n\nSoil moisture levels have now dropped below the 10th percentile in the region.\n\n\u201cAgricultural interests are reporting drought-related stresses on pastures and hayfields, as well as crop stress to soybeans and other late-planted grains,\u201d the drought statement said. \u201cOther crops such as corn and apples are reported to be faring well, with some crops actually better than last year since last year was so wet.\u201d\n\n\n\nSoil moisture levels relative to normal. (National Weather Service)\n\nThe statement said stream levels, which were above normal early in the summer, have fallen below normal in many areas.\n\nThe drought has not yet become severe or long-lived enough to have a substantial impact on groundwater in the region. \u201cShallower aquifers have turned below normal quickly over the past few weeks; but deeper groundwater storage is still at or above what is typical for this time of year,\u201d the drought statement said.\n\nWhile little rainfall is predicted over the next week to 10 days, the Weather Service continues to project a return to wetter conditions later this month and into November.\n\n\u201cThere are some hints at a longer range return to at least more normal precipitation, and the Climate Prediction Center\u2019s outlook for the rest of the calendar year does favor above normal precipitation,\u201d the drought statement said. \u201cUntil and unless this occurs, though, all of the existing conditions will likely continue to deteriorate.\u201d", "description": "Washington\u2019s rainfall since the start of September, 0.27 inches, ranks as the second least on record.", "authors": ["Jason Samenow", "Editor", "Writer Covering Weather", "October At Am", "Jason Samenow Is The Washington Post S Weather Editor", "Capital Weather Gang'S Chief Meteorologist.
