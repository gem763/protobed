I thought we had a good debate.\"\n\n\"I was surprised to see (the tweets) came out this late in the campaign. I would expect that if something like that would have happened, it probably would have come out a lot earlier,\" Orrell said.\n\nBut Orrell says the controversy doesn't change anything for his campaign.\n\n\n\n\"We have our own campaign to run and I've never looked at anyone else's campaign to find out what they were doing and if we would change ours different. We had a plan from the start and we're going to stick to that plan.\"\n\nThe NDP candidate in Sydney-Victoria, Jodi McDavid, declined to comment.\n\nCBC News previously requested an interview with Battiste, but the Liberal Party declined the request. It instead sent out a statement via email attributed to him.\n\n\"I would like to apologize for my comments,\" he said. \"At times in my life, I have made crude jokes that I thought were funny at the time, but I realize now that these words were offensive.\n\n\"These were things I said during difficult times in my life, and they are not a reflection of my beliefs or who I am today. I apologize unreservedly.\"\n\nSusan Farrell, Battiste's campaign manager and president of the Sydney-Victoria Liberal Association, declined to comment, but said Battiste will continue to campaign Monday. She said Battiste was at home Sunday in Eskasoni First Nation with his family.", "description": "Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau says comments made by a Liberal candidate in Nova Scotia in old social media posts are unacceptable, but that he is not removing him as a candidate.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5297082.1569437586!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/jaime-battiste.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
