Walter Peeters\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very slow burn. In some markets you can wing it, maybe pull an order in straight away, but not Indonesia. It is tiring \u2013 you have to have capacity and tenacity.\u201d\n\nFor many it has proved too great an effort, particularly with other countries laying out the welcome mat. While some south-east Asian nations including Malaysia and Vietnam have benefited greatly from the Sino-US trade war, picking up business from production giants looking for a new regional hub, Indonesia is still playing catch-up. Between June and August 2019, 33 Chinese-listed companies announced plans to set up or expand production abroad. Twenty-three of these are headed to Vietnam. The remainder are going to Cambodia, India, Malaysia, Mexico, Serbia and Thailand. Not one went to Indonesia.\n\n\u201cOur macroeconomic stability is quite good but our labour regulations are not as flexible as other ASEAN countries,\" says David Sumual, chief economist at Bank Central Asia. \"We have to increase our capacity and the price must be competitive.\u201d\n\nRecent years have seen a series of missed chances. Sumual cites the example of Foxconn, a Taiwanese multinational electronics contract manufacturer, which was in negotiations to build a production site. \u201cThe government offered land but the bureaucracy moved too slowly, until finally Foxconn invested in India.\u201d\n\nIn less turbulent times, such relocations would be icing on the cake. But rarely has the global economy been beset with such high levels of uncertainty. Last month the World Bank predicted Indonesia\u2019s GDP growth would continue to decline because of weak productivity and slowing labour growth while a \u201cglobal slowdown causes lower commodity prices which will hurt Indonesia\u2019s GDP growth even more\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndonesia\u2019s current account deficit is now running at $US33 billion ($48 billion) a year while foreign direct investment is around $US22 billion. The problem is not the deficit per se, the World Bank figures, it is the lack of \u201cexport-oriented FDI investors who create good jobs and cannot easily take their investment out of the country\u201d. Companies like Foxconn. As Sumual puts it, \"We need those jobs and we need those taxes.\u201d\n\nThe World Bank laid out a reform plan for Indonesia and warned it must not be led astray, as had happened previously, by \u201cshadow powers to issue arbitrary administrative decisions and lower level regulations that contradict government regulations and laws\u201d.\n\nThis was unusually blunt language for the World Bank, notes Faisal Basri, an economist, one-time politician, author and University of Indonesia academic. Faisal disagrees with some of the World Bank\u2019s conclusions \u2013 he argues the level of FDI is not the problem, but rather the productivity of capital which is weighed down by state-owned enterprises \u2013 but he agrees there is a pressing need for change. The country\u2019s future prosperity is at stake and, so Faisal believes, is its 20-year-old democracy.\n\n\u201cGrowth is slow because of the nature of our institutions and regulations, not because of a lack of investment. What we need is structural adjustment,\" says Faisal, whose past students include Finance Minister Sri Mulyani.\n\nThis is a dangerous time for democracy in Indonesia. \u2014 Faisal Basri, academic and author\n\nBut what Faisal has seen is the opposite. He is among those calling on Jokowi to issue a perbu, or presidential degree, winding back a new law passed in September that weakens the power of the nation\u2019s main anti-corruption body, the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK), even though its work is supported by a majority of Indonesians. Faisal, who unsuccessfully ran for governor of Jakarta against Jokowi in 2012, is appalled by some of what he has seen, such as SOEs lending money to politicians.\n\n\u201cThis is a dangerous time for democracy in Indonesia,\u201d Faisal says. While some have pointed out that GDP growth was higher, on average, during Indonesia\u2019s decades of authoritarian rule in the second half of the 20th century than in the past two decades of democracy, Faisal contends the weakening of democratic institutions undermines economic resilience.\n\n\u201cWe have to focus on strengthening our institutions, on shifting the exclusive and obstructive to inclusive; from those that deliver benefits only to a select few, to those that work for the majority.\"\n\nWhen Faisal spoke to AFR Weekend on Tuesday, he was preparing for a book launch. His latest work, titled Toward a Golden Indonesia, was finished close to the election when optimism about the future came more easily. Now, he says, Indonesians have to speak up. And trust in the young.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have to still be optimistic we can have a golden era by helping our Millennials achieve their potential.\u201d\n\nEntrepreneur and investor Shinta Dhanuwardoyo is another big believer in that potential. She's been a driving force in the country\u2019s fast-growing tech sector since 1996 when she founded a web development company, Bubu, that has morphed into Indonesia\u2019s leading full-service digital agency.\n\nIn a country where there are 1.3 mobile phones for every person, \u201ceverything is mobile first\u201d, notes Dhanuwardoyo, who has mentored and invested in many start-ups. While Indonesia, like Australia, is a resource-driven economy it has also raised four unicorns: Go-Jek, Tokopedia, Traveloka and Bukalapak. This month the government claimed a fifth, fintech company Ovo. Indonesia has a talent for tech and a huge readymade market but it lacks a sufficient skills base, Dhanuwardoyo says.\n\nThe creative economy\n\n\"Indonesia ranks in the top five of every social media platform. But we lack programmers, engineers and developers. Without them, we cannot really grow.\"\n\nLast week the Jokowi government announced details of a plan to extend broadband connections to some of the most remote islands in the archipelago nation. It\u2019s sorely needed, Dhanuwardoyo says, noting that outside of the major cities connection speeds can be very slow.\n\nDhanuwardoyo would like to see in the new cabinet a ministry for the creative economy that will address some of the regulatory obstacles faced by entrepreneurs, such as the month-long wait to register a company.\n\nEntrepreneur Shinta Dhanuwardoyo has been a driving force in Indonesia\u2019s fast-growing tech sector. AFR\n\n\"Look at what we have done with what we have got now and just imagine what we could do. Our start-ups are trying to solve this country\u2019s problems,\u201d she says.\n\nThis weekend there will be 30,000 police and military on the streets of Jakarta. In recent weeks protesters opposed to \u2013 among other measures passed in recent months \u2013 the gutting of the KPK have at times violently clashed with security forces, but the government has threatened mass arrests in an effort to keep the streets clear for the inauguration. The authorities are hopeful the event will go off without a hitch and images of Jokowi being congratulated by world leaders will be beamed around the globe.\n\nBut all of that is a prelude to the main event. It is the cabinet appointments that will determine how the next chapter of the Indonesian story plays out.\n\nAndry S. Nugroho from the Jakarta-based Institute for Development of Economics and Finance is among those concerned by the prospect of a \"national unity government\" with no functioning opposition. He fears Jokowi's desire to accommodate everyone - not just his coalition partners but even opposition parties - will further dilute decision-making.\n\n\"We're concerned that, to pacify those who don't get a cabinet post, there will be more institutions and agencies created. That will lead to more co-ordination issues.\"\n\nNugroho is also concerned the President will be tempted into rash measures to attract foreign investment.\n\n\"My hope is the new cabinet will focus on improving industrial performance. In the first term of the Jokowi government, economists wanted the President and the cabinet to focus on industry reform. That work has still not been done.\"", "description": "Will President Joko Widodo's next government favour politics over prosperity?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_93/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/64a69677400409374e59af39704d00a6b06b0bb3", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
