My first college internship was at a data science startup, where I spent my summer writing scrapers and learning how to convert clunky HTML tables into elegant spreadsheets that were ripe for analyzing. And although I don\u2019t write much code nowadays, I still get giddy about handling data. This ethos has bled into my journalism career, in a weird way.\n\nI\u2019ve got a natural pre-disposition to open systems. If an app or physical product lets me control my own data, I\u2019m far more likely to look more favorably upon it. That\u2019s equal parts the product of some Stallman-esque philosophy, but also because at heart, I\u2019m a nerd. I like to tinker.\n\nOn that note, meet the WiCub 2. This small device lets you measure the quality of the air in your bedroom or office. It\u2019s got a small e-ink screen that gives you the pertinent details, like temperature, humidity, pressure, and the indoor air quality. If your room is particularly stuffy, it\u2019ll nudge you to open the window with an unhappy emoji. It is, after all, 2019.\n\nThe WiCub 2 is a touch bigger than a box of raisins. It comes with a 40 day battery. Connect it to your home network and it\u2019ll email you regular updates or provide you the hard data through a JSON interface. Although there isn\u2019t a full API, you probably don\u2019t need one. It\u2019s really straightforward to integrate the data into your own application. The sole two components you need are something to download the file (like Python\u2019s Requests library) and something to actually parse the JSON data.\n\nAt \u00a3100 (about $125, give or take the Brexit news cycle), it\u2019s slightly more expensive than the arguably more capable Airthings Wave Mini, which can detect potentially harmful substances like radon. But it\u2019s also not tied to a cloud service that might not exist in a few years time.\n\nIn general, I\u2019m pretty cynical about the Internet of Things. I worry about the vanishingly short longevity of most devices. I don\u2019t like how a someone can flick a switch and make people\u2019s expensive computerized gadgets stop working, like Google did with Revolv. I struggle to understand how, in a tech landscape that\u2019s populated with open standards, smart devices have a shorter lifespan than their \u201cdumb\u201d counterparts.\n\nBut then I see things like the WiCub 2, and realize there\u2019s a better, more sustainable way to do IoT. And that\u2019s to give users as much control as possible, while simultaneously divorcing it from complicated and short-lived cloud services.\n\nI should note I\u2019ve used the previous model. Mesh-Net, the developer, mailed me a unit circa 2017, although I didn\u2019t quite get around to writing a full review. You can blame that on the frenetic madness of getting married. That said, I remember being distinctly impressed by the device.\n\nThe follow-up, the WiCub 2, is currently being crowdfunded on IndieGogo. If you\u2019re tempted to back the project and get a device, you can do so here \u2013 albeit with the obligatory warning that crowdfunding campaigns always come with risk ringing in your ears.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "The WiCub 2 is an air quality monitor that gives you control over your data.
