Asa Hutchinson announced in August 2015 that the state would terminate its contract following the release of videos that raised disturbing allegations of Planned Parenthood profiting from the sale of organs from aborted babies\u2019 body parts.\n\nThe state Department of Human Services informed Planned Parenthood it would cancel its contract within 30 days and that Planned Parenthood had a right to an administrative appeal under state law.\n\nInstead, Planned Parenthood rounded up a group of patients (known as the \u201cJane Does\u201d) to file suit in federal court.\n\nIn their lawsuit, the Jane Does argue that, under the Medicaid Act\u2019s \u201cfree choice of provider\u201d provision, the state cannot prohibit them from obtaining medical care from the qualified provider of their choice\u2014unless that provider is unfit to provide medical services.\n\nThe main question at issue is whether the Jane Does have a judicially enforceable right to select their health care provider. Several federal courts have weighed in on this issue in cases out of Louisiana, Indiana, Michigan, and Arizona.\n\nUnder 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(23)(A), state Medicaid plans must \u201cprovide that \u2026 any individual eligible for medical assistance (including drugs) may obtain such assistance from any institution, agency, community pharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service or services required \u2026 who undertakes to provide him such services.\u201d\n\nThe Jane Does claim this language allows them to sue the state for seeking to deprive them of receiving services from any qualified health care provider, even though Planned Parenthood had been decertified as an approved provider.\n\nA federal district court in Little Rock, Arkansas, granted the Jane Does\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction, preventing the state from cutting off Planned Parenthood\u2019s Medicaid funding.\n\nOn appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals of the 8th Circuit overturned the injunction in an opinion by Judge Steven Colloton (one of President Donald Trump\u2019s potential Supreme Court nominees).\n\nIn the 2-1 decision, Colloton concluded that a law directing government officials to take an action (as \u00a7 23(A) does) \u201cdoes not confer the sort of \u2018individual entitlement\u2019 that is enforceable\u201d in court by beneficiaries of that law.\n\nFurther, reading \u00a7 23(A) in light of the broader statutory text, Colloton found that it\u2019s not clear Congress intended to create an individual right\u2014and Congress\u2019 \u201cunambiguous\u201d intent is a prerequisite for the Jane Does\u2019 lawsuit to move forward.\n\nOther courts, including the 7th Circuit in a 2012 decision out of Indiana by Judge Diane Sykes (another Trump short-lister), have reached the opposite conclusion.\n\nFurthermore, the 5th Circuit is currently considering Texas\u2019 appeal of a district court ruling that prevented it from blocking Medicaid funds from going to a Planned Parenthood affiliate that was previously forced to pay the state $1.4 million in a settlement for allegations of Medicaid fraud.\n\nIf the 5th Circuit joins the 8th Circuit in ruling against allowing private rights of action to enforce the Medicaid \u201cfree choice of provider\u201d provision, that would tee the issue up for Supreme Court review. A split among the federal appeals courts increases the odds that the justices will decide to review a case.\n\nNow the ball is back in the Jane Does\u2019 court, as they weigh whether to ask the full 8th Circuit to rehear their case or go straight to the Supreme Court for review.\n\nA Supreme Court ruling that allowed states to freely terminate Medicaid agreements would deal a major blow to Planned Parenthood, which receives half a billion dollars from taxpayers each year.\n\nAs Planned Parenthood\u2019s most recent annual report showed, abortions at its clinics are on the rise, while cancer treatment and screenings, HPV vaccinations, contraception, and prenatal services have rapidly declined.\n\nThough the Hyde Amendment prevents Medicaid funding for abortions in most circumstances, money is fungible. That means the taxpayer dollars Planned Parenthood receives for non-abortion services free up other resources for abortion.\n\nIf states choose to decertify Planned Parenthood as a Medicaid provider, scarce government funds could instead be directed to the thousands of centers that actually provide health care for women without entanglement in abortion on demand.", "description": "This week, a federal appeals court\u00a0upheld Arkansas\u2019 decision\u00a0to cancel its Medicaid provider agreement with Planned Parenthood, which allowed Medicaid recipients to receive non-abortion services at Planned Parenthood clinics.\n\nThis is good news for other states that decide to stop allowing taxpayers\u2019 money to flow to Planned Parenthood.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Slattery", "Commentary By", "Legal Fellow", "Appellate Advocacy Program Manager", "Meese Center For Legal", "Judicial Studies", "Research Associate"], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2017-08/planned%20parenthood.jpg?itok=iUrYpWEp"}
