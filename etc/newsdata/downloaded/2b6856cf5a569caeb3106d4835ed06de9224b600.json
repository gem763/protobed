It also offers access to 80,000 surcharge-free ATMs. But should you need to use one outside that vast network, Alliant won\u2019t charge you. Instead the credit union reimburses up to $20 a month in fees other ATM owners might apply.\n\nAnd it\u2019s easy to join, a one-time donation to nonprofit Foster Care to Success qualifies you as a member. Alternatively, if you\u2019ve worked for one of the many organizations it partners with or live in a community near its Chicago headquarters, you also qualify. Finally, Alliant\u2019s Android and Apple mobile apps earn high ratings from customers.\n\nCaveat: Unless you happen to live close to Alliant\u2019s two branch locations, you\u2019ll have to do all your banking online.\n\nWhere you can find it: Ill.\n\nKey account: High-Interest Checking\n\nMonthly service fee: $0\n\nInterest rate: 0.45%\n\nOutside ATM fee: $0\n\nMethodology:\n\nMONEY partnered with MagnifyMoney.com to produce this year\u2019s Best Banks rankings.
