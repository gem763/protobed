The journalist asked Pompeo what might warrant a military response.\n\n\"Where we see American interests at stake or fundamental norms around the world that need to be enforced, we\u2019ll use all the powers that we have,\" Pompeo told Frost on \"Closing Bell.\"\n\n\u201cWe prefer peace to war. But in the event that kinetic action or military action is needed, you should know that President Trump is fully prepared to undertake that action,\u201d he added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt wasn't clear that Pompeo was referring specifically to Turkey. Trump has faced widespread condemnation following his decision earlier this month to pull U.S. troops from northeast Syria, essentially giving Turkey the green light to launch an invasion against Syrian Kurdish fighters and civilians. The U.S. has counted on the Kurds as a vital partner in the fight against ISIS, though Turkey sees them as part of a terrorist arm known as the PKK.\n\nMore than 100 Syrian Kurdish civilians have been killed in the Turkish strikes, though Trump has insisted the U.S. bears no responsibility.\n\n\u201cWe never agreed to protect the Kurds,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday. \u201cWe supported them for 3 \u00bd, four years. We never agreed to protect the Kurds for the rest of their lives.\u201d\n\nHe also said he doesn\u2019t believe it will be necessary to leave U.S. troops in Syria except to secure oil fields.\n\nPompeo would not say what would warrant a military response from the U.S. but noted that \u201cwe\u2019ve done it before,\u201d a reference to when the Trump administration struck Syria government facilities in 2017 and 2018 after Syrian President Bashar Assad used chemical weapons against civilians.\n\n\u201cWe did it, and the world should know that we will continue to do that,\u201d Pompeo said before adding that the administration would prefer to use economic or diplomatic means/\n\nHe added that did not want to \u201cget out in front of the president\u2019s decision about whether to take the awesome undertaking of using America\u2019s military might.\u201d\n\nThe administration last week announced it would impose sanctions on Turkey over its Syria incursion before announcing days later that it would not impose them after the NATO ally and Kurdish forces agreed to a five-day cease-fire. The 120 hours would allow the Kurdish fighters to evacuate a safe zone roughly 20 miles from the Turkey-Syria border.\n\nThe deal was quickly panned by lawmakers, including Republicans who regularly back Trump, who said it abandoned a U.S. partner with no repercussions for Turkey.\n\nPompeo, however, said he was \u201cfully convinced that that work saved lives.\u201d", "description": "President Trump \u201cis fully prepared\u201d to use military force\u00a0should it be \u201cneeded,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Monday when asked about Turkey's invasion of Syria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_pompeomike_10212019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
