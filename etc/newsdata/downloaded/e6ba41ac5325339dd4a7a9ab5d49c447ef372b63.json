It was released on Friday.\n\n\"In its movie ... (Netflix) defames and portrays the plaintiffs (Mossack and Fonseca) as ruthless uncaring lawyers who are involved in money laundering, tax evasion, bribes and/or other criminal conduct,\" Mossack Fonseca said in the 42-page lawsuit, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in U.S. federal court in Connecticut on Oct 13.\n\nIn the official trailer for \"The Laundromat,\" which co-stars Meryl Streep as a widow investigating insurance fraud, the following question is asked and answered in big, bold type: \"How do 15 million millionaires in 200 countries stay rich? With lawyers like these.\"\n\nThe trailer then cuts to the elegantly dressed lawyers played by Oldman and Banderas laughing uproariously.\n\nMossack Fonseca shut down last year after being accused by U.S. prosecutors of helping clients conceal assets, investments and income from government tax authorities using a wide range of sham foundations and shell companies.\n\nWhile Jurgen Mossack did not respond to requests for comment, a source close to both lawyers told Reuters that they maintain their position that the massive leak of the firm's internal documents consisted of \"information theft or hacking\" that was illegal.\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "Mossack Fonseca, a Panamanian law firm at the center of the \"Panama Papers\" scandal, has filed a lawsuit against Netflix Inc over its new movie based on the case, accusing the video streaming company of defamation and seeking to stop the film's release.
