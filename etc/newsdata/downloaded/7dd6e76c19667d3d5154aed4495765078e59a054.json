Anyone interested in acquiring lots of credit card numbers isn\u2019t going to bother trolling around in the real world, risking being recorded on a surveillance camera when they can safely buy as many of them as they want on the \"dark web.\"\n\nYou\u2019re already covered\n\nEven if someone was able to trick your card into paying for something wirelessly, your credit card company won\u2019t stick you with the bill. You\u2019re infinitely more likely to be compromised in a number of other ways.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThe technology being used for contactless credit card transactions is completely safe and super convenient, so don\u2019t be afraid to use it.\n\nThose companies selling RFID-blocking products are trying to convince you that they have a solution to a problem that actually doesn\u2019t exist, so save your money.\n\nKen Colburn is founder and CEO of Data Doctors Computer Services datadoctors.com.\n\nAsk any tech question at: facebook.com/DataDoctors or on Twitter @TheDataDoc.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/10/20/rfid-blocking-wallets-do-you-really-need-use-them/4023999002/", "description": "The companies behind RFID-blocking products claim they will keep your credit cards secure.
