These are not scenes normally associated with the highest office in the land, but they appear in a doctored video of Donald Trump shown at a pro-Trump conference in Miami last week.\n\nFusion GPS founders to release book on Trump\u2019s ties with Russia Read more\n\nThe two-minute clip is taken from a famous scene from the end of the movie Kingsman, in which the lead character, played by Colin Firth, goes on a killing spree in a church.\n\nOn Monday, a list of high-profile figures slammed the president for failing to condemn the video.\n\nIn the edited video, Trump\u2019s face is digitally superimposed on to Firth\u2019s body, and he is depicted shooting, stabbing and attacking adversaries in the \u201cChurch of Fake News\u201d.\n\nIt includes a scene of him setting the 2020 Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders on fire, stabbing the comedian Rosie O\u2019Donnell in the face and throwing the Californian congresswoman Maxine Waters out of a window. At the end of the video, Trump sticks an axe in CNN and then walks off smirking, admiring the scene of dead bodies across the floor.\n\nDemocratic political strategists pointed out that Trump had manage to send out a tweet encouraging his followers to vote for Sean Spicer on Dancing with the Stars since the video was released.\n\nAdam Parkhomenko (@AdamParkhomenko) Every headline says trump condemned that video. He has done no such thing. The only statement from the WH says he hasn\u2019t even seen it. Asshole is on twitter all day. When he wants to condemn something, he does. Stop giving him free passes.\n\nMeghan McCain called the video \u201cdisgusting and disturbing\u201d on The View on Monday morning. Her father, the late senator John McCain, is specifically targeted in the video, with Trump hitting him in the back of the head with a gun.\n\nWidower Cindy McCain also spoke out against the video today, saying it violated \u201cevery norm our society expects from its leaders\u201d.\n\nCindy McCain (@cindymccain) Reports describing a violent video played at a Trump Campaign event in which images of reporters & @JohnMcCain are being slain by Pres Trump violate every norm our society expects from its leaders& the institutions that bare their names. I stand w/ @whca in registering my outrage\n\nAndrea Chamblee, whose husband was killed in the Capital Gazette shooting last year said that the video was \u201cnot only offensive, but dangerous\u201d. She is a volunteer for the gun safety activist organisation Moms Demand Action, and was quoted by its founder, Shannon Watts, in a tweet.\n\nShannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) \u201cVideos like the one shown at a political event for President Trump are not only offensive, but dangerous to the safety of my husband's fellow news media colleagues,\u201d Andrea Chamblee, a @MomsDemand volunteer whose husband was fatally shot at the Capital Gazette #TrumpVideo\n\nThose thoughts were echoed by the Connecticut senator Richard Blumenthal, who said that the video was a reminder of behavior that Trump has encouraged during his time as president.\n\nRichard Blumenthal (@SenBlumenthal) Despite the White House\u2019s half hearted distancing, this sickening video is a reminder & result of what Trump has condoned, even encouraged. Make no mistake: Mass murder, gun violence, & raw hatred have no place in our country\u2014Americans are saying enough is enough. https://t.co/BZBWtk1T2W\n\n\n\nAlmost 50 political opponents and media organizations are name-checked in the video, including:\n\nABC\n\nAdam Schiff\n\nAntifa\n\nBarack Obama\n\nBill Clinton\n\nThe BBC\n\nBlack Lives Matter\n\nBloomberg\n\nBuzzFeed\n\nBernie Sanders\n\nCBS News\n\nCNBC\n\nThe Democratic party\n\nGlobal News\n\nThe Guardian\n\nHarvey Weinstein (as an attacker)\n\nHillary Clinton\n\nThe Hill\n\nHuffPost\n\nJames Comey\n\nJoe Kennedy\n\nJohn McCain\n\nKathy Griffin\n\nMaxine Waters\n\nMika Brzenzinski\n\nMitt Romney\n\nNBC\n\nTalking Points Memo\n\nThe New Yorker\n\nNPR\n\nThe Obama Foundation\n\nPBS\n\nPeter Fonda\n\nPolitico\n\nRachel Maddow\n\nRosie O\u2019Donnell\n\nSlate\n\nUnivision Noticias\n\nThe Washington Post\n\nWomen\u2019s March USA\n\nYahoo News\n\nThe Young Turks\n\nVice\n\nVox\n\nThe video appears to have been created more than a year ago, but was shown at a three-day conference held by American Priority last week, at a Trump hotel in Miami. It is likely a rip-off of another video that was uploaded for a 2017 Infowars meme competition, in which Trump is depicted in the same killing spree, attacking CNN.\n\nTrump and former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders both attended the conference but say they did not see the video, according to the Times. On Sunday evening, the White House condemned the violence depicted in the video.", "description": "Doctored clip taken from the film Kingsman shows president attacking Bernie Sanders, Rosie O\u2019Donnell and John McCain, among others", "authors": ["Poppy Noor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6161d4fbf5934ef4aff6ae6052d26216b17eab7b/0_53_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4b5e9b8dc721d48debfdbb5d4bcc8137", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
