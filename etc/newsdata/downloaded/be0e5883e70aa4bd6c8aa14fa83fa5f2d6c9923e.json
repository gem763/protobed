That prediction is based on three different forecasts for advertising revenue averaging out to $27.6 billion plus about $2 billion in subscription sales.\n\nThe three predictions for advertising revenue are based on content acquisition costs, monthly active users, and total hours viewed per day.\n\nThe figures for those metrics came from public statements by CEO Susan Wojcicki and estimates from Alphabet's \"Other Cost of Revenue\" category, where Alphabet currently recognizes YouTube's cost, according to Martin's report.", "description": "Alphabet-owned YouTube could be worth as much as $300 billion if it were a standalone company, according to Needham & Company analyst Laura Martin.&nb...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5db88bb5dee01931ff5c8792-2000/2013-02-14t120000z2029976764gm1e92e1eu601rtrmadp3japan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
