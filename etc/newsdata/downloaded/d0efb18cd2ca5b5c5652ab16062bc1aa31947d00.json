He said that the reactions vary wildly, with 'one half thinks it's great' while 'the other cannot imagine a blessing from a machine.'\n\nRemarkably, von Gehren said that especially people who have little in common with the church are attracted to the robot, with many people 'now coming every morning and evening.'\n\nA robot priest that beams lights from its hands is giving 'auto-blessings' in the same German city where Martin Luther launched the Protestant Reformation\n\nChurch spokesman Sebastian von Gehren said the robot was 'an experiment that is supposed to inspire discussion'\n\nBrunhilde Hoeltz-Mettang, a visitor to the church celebrations in Wittenberg, said the robot was 'interesting and courageous' even though it lacked the human touch.\n\nShe said: 'We have to think of new ways, beyond our core communities.'\n\nYet 500 years after Martin Luther nailed his 95 Theses to a church door in Wittenberg, the robot priest will not replace humans any time soon.\n\nVon Gehren said: 'The machine should not replace the blessing of a pastor. In the future there will not be a blessing robot in every church.'", "description": "Five hundred years after Luther published the 95 Theses in the town of Wittenberg, in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, an evangelical church unveiled an automatic blessing robot.", "authors": ["Mailonline Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/05/29/18/40EB68B100000578-0-image-a-5_1496078274539.jpg", "published_at": "2017-05-29"}
