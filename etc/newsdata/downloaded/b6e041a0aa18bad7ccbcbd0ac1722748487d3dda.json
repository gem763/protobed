Instead, look at what drives children into institutions,\" she told a conference in London.\n\nThe author set up a charity, Lumos, in response to cases of neglect in Eastern European orphanages, which is campaigning to remove children from orphanages and return them to their families.\n\nIt operates in countries including Moldova, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Colombia, Haiti, Ethiopia and Kenya.\n\nEnd to 'volun-tourism'\n\nBut Rowling warned that orphanages were being given support by \"volun-tourism\", where young people from Western countries volunteered to help in orphanages as part of their travelling experience.\n\nShe also discouraged visits to orphanages by travellers, describing it as \"orphanage tourism\".\n\nImage caption The Lumos charity has been working with children in Haiti\n\nThe author told the One Young World conference there were widespread misunderstandings about orphanages - and that worldwide about eight out of 10 children in orphanages had a living parent.\n\nShe said orphanages might have been set up with good intentions, but often did \"irreparable harm\" by separating children from their families.\n\n'Abuse and trafficking'\n\n\"Institutionalisation is one of the worst things that you can possibly do to a child,\" she said.\n\n\"It renders children very vulnerable to abuse and trafficking, it has huge effects on their normal development, and it massively impacts their life chances.\"\n\nThe reasons that children ended up in orphanages were problems such as poverty, natural disasters and disability, she said.\n\nBut she said overseas visitors and volunteers were \"propping up\" and subsidising them.\n\n\"In other words, \"volun-tourism' and orphanage tourism, where you're taken to see children in an orphanage as part of your travel experience,\" she said.\n\n\"Often these young people will come away believing they did good, and are appalled when the facts are laid out in front of them, and they realise that they may have contributed to the perpetuation of abuse.\"", "description": "The Harry Potter author says volunteering in orphanages can unwittingly support child cruelty.", "authors": ["Sean Coughlan", "Bbc News Family", "Education Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/11B80/production/_109367527_rowling1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
