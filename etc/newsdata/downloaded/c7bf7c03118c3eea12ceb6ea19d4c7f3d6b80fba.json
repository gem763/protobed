The territory statistics were similar, proving that while possession is all well and good, what matters more is making the most of your chances when they arise.\n\n\u2013 Turnover ball is good ball \u2013\n\nOne area, other than the scoreboard, where England finished with a huge numerical advantage was in forcing 18 Australia turnovers with Eddie Jones\u2019s men only coughing up eight of their own.\n\nTurnovers are valuable because they create attacking opportunities against teams, who because they were going forward themselves, haven\u2019t had time to set their defence.\n\nAnd with England\u2019s young flankers Tom Curry and Sam Underhill \u2014 dubbed the \u201ckamikaze kids\u201d by Jones for their fearless all-action style \u2014 leading the way, the Red Rose brigade were able to dominate a key aspect of the match.\n\n\u2013 Handle with care \u2013\n\nAustralia\u2019s game revolves around quick passing and slick handling. Yet they made 12 handling errors to England\u2019s five, often coughing up possession in key areas as, frustratingly for the Wallabies, periods of prolonged possession ended without them having any points to show for it.\n\nIn part this was a consequence of England\u2019s resilience, with prop Kyle Sinckler \u2014 who scored his maiden Test try in this match \u2014 making one of several important defensive rips.\n\n\u2013 England keep their cool \u2013\n\nAlthough the final result was decisive, Australia cut England\u2019s lead to just a point at 17-16 three minutes into the second half.\n\nPrevious England sides may well have lost their composure in similar circumstances, and with it the game.\n\nIt was a personal triumph for England captain Owen Farrell, who also had a flawless match from the tee in landing all eight of his goalkicks for a 20-point haul.\n\nThere has long been the suspicion opponents can rattle the fiery fly-half-cum-centre, but what Farrell noted of his team afterwards was also true of the Saracens atar himself.\n\n\u201cThe boys were calm and in control and we had clear messages about what we were going to do next,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013 Flexibility a friend \u2013\n\nThe very best teams have a game-plan they trust but also an ability to vary their tactics if the situation demands it.\n\nWhile Australia went through several half-back pairings at the World Cup without a noticeable change in their game, Jones\u2019s decision to bench George Ford, move Farrell to fly-half from centre and recall Henry Slade helped shore up England\u2019s midfield defence.\n\nIt also meant Slade could produce the excellent grubber kick that led to the second of wing Jonny May\u2019s two tries in three minutes.\n\nMeanwhile Australia coach Michael Cheika responded to his seventh straight loss to an England side coached by former Randwick team-mate Jones by saying: \u201cI would rather win playing our way, that\u2019s the way Aussies want us to play.\u201d", "description": "Oita (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 England advanced to the semi-finals of the Rugby World Cup with a 40-16 victory over Australia on Saturday.
