They are largely ineligible under the new rule, as are asylum seekers from Africa, Asia and South America who arrive regularly at the southern border.\n\nDemocrats condemn reported Trump plan to bar most refugees from US Read more\n\nGroups challenging the policy in court say that it violates the US refugee act and the UN refugee convention guaranteeing the right to seek asylum to those fleeing persecution.\n\nThe shift reverses decades of US policy. The administration has said that it wants to close the gap between an initial asylum screening that most people pass and a final decision on asylum that most people do not win.\n\nIn a scathing dissent, justices Ruth Bader Ginsberg and Sonya Sotomayor say that the supreme court \u201csidesteps the ordinary judicial process\u201d by overriding proceedings in the lower courts.\n\n\u201cOnce again, the Executive Branch has issued a rule that seeks to upend longstanding practices regarding refugees who seek shelter from persecution,\u201d Sotomayor wrote.\n\nThe legal challenge to the new policy has a brief but somewhat convoluted history. The US district judge Jon Tigar in San Francisco blocked the new policy from taking effect in late July. A three-judge panel of the ninth US circuit court of appeals narrowed Tigar\u2019s order so that it applied only in Arizona and California, states that are within the ninth circuit.\n\nThat left the administration free to enforce the policy on asylum seekers arriving in New Mexico and Texas. Tigar issued a new order on Monday that reimposed a nationwide hold on asylum policy. The ninth circuit again narrowed his order on Tuesday.\n\nThe high-court action leaves the administration free to impose the new policy everywhere while the court case against it continues.\n\nTrump celebrated the verdict with a tweet on Wednesday evening: \u201cBIG United States Supreme Court WIN for the Border on Asylum!\u201d\n\nBut it remains unclear how quickly the policy will be rolled out, and how exactly it fits in with the other efforts by the administration to restrict border crossings and tighten asylum rules.\n\nFor example, thousands of people are waiting on lists at border crossings in Mexico to claim asylum in the US. And more than 30,000 people have been turned back to Mexico to wait out their asylum claims.\n\nLee Gelernt, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who is representing immigrant advocacy groups in the case, said: \u201cThis is just a temporary step, and we\u2019re hopeful we\u2019ll prevail at the end of the day. The lives of thousands of families are at stake.\u201d", "description": "Justices\u2019 order reverses a lower court ruling that blocked the restrictions in some states", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/816ceddb8b94c3bb8bbea98b0b6421c517f02f97/0_149_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7afc87316ca0859b930e99b7223727b7", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
