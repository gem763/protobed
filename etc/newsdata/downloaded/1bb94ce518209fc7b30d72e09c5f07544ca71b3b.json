We\u2019re here for the zero-gravity flight.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSo: a weightless flight from ZERO-G, a company headquartered in Northern Virginia that offers otherworldly experiences from airports around the country. That alone would have made anyone\u2019s day. But Greg didn\u2019t know about the little box Mollie had taken through TSA security and secreted in a pocket of her blue flight suit.\n\n\u201cIt was an elaborate web of deception,\u201d Greg said with a laugh.\n\nAD\n\nAfter a light breakfast of plain food \u2014 there\u2019s a reason these aircraft are called Vomit Comets \u2014 and some instruction, Mollie, Greg and the other ZERO-G customers boarded the 727.\n\nThe plane took off, and the pilot steered it in gentle undulations that approximated the gravity on Mars and the Moon. Then it was time for the main event: the weightlessness of space.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe actual proposal was a little trickier than I thought it was going to be,\u201d Mollie said. \u201cThey tell you before you get on the flight not to try to \u2018swim.\u2019 That\u2019s a normal reaction.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s what Mollie tried to do when she realized she was floating away from Greg just as she was preparing to pop the question.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou see me in the video frantically trying to swim back in Greg\u2019s direction,\u201d she said.\n\nFiguring it was now or never, Mollie pulled out the box, took aim and threw it at her sweetheart.\n\nGreg dove for it and caught it. When he opened the box, out floated a ring inlaid with fossilized dinosaur bone.\n\nSaid Mollie: \u201cHe manages to grab the ring, and I popped the question: \u2018Greg, will you marry me?\u2019 \u201d\n\nGreg\u2019s answer: \u201cAbsolutely, yes.\u201d\n\nThere followed a dozen more parabolas, with Greg and Mollie floating, flipping, doing handstands, curling into balls and being tossed around the cabin.\n\nAD\n\nThe Fairfax couple haven\u2019t yet set a date for their nuptials.\n\n\u201cHopefully, the wedding will be as exciting as the proposal,\u201d Mollie said.\n\nAD\n\nIt sounds like they have no plans of ever hitting the ground.\n\nA baseball error\n\nAs you may have seen in my column yesterday, I\u2019ve become fixated on how Washington prepared for its first World Series appearance. In 1924, the city was abuzz and agog \u2014 agozz, you might say.\n\nI suppose that\u2019s not surprising. What did surprise me, though, was the controversy that dogged the series, something I\u2019d never heard of before. There were some who thought the games shouldn\u2019t have been played at all.\n\nThat\u2019s because of a scandal involving the National League champion New York Giants and the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nAs the regular season entered its final days, the Phillies were mired at the bottom of the league. The Giants were neck and neck with Brooklyn. Phillies shortstop Heinie Sand told his manager, Art Fletcher, that during the final series, against the Giants, he\u2019d been offered $500 by New York outfielder Jimmy O\u2019Connell to \u201ctake it easy.\u201d In other words: Throw the game. \u201cNothing doing,\u201d Sand said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis was bad for a sport still smarting from the 1919 Black Sox scandal. After a quick investigation, Commissioner Kenesaw Landis banned O\u2019Connell and Giants coach Cozy Dolan from baseball. The American League commissioner, B. Bancroft \u201cBan\u201d Johnson, wanted the World Series canceled, or to have second-place Brooklyn play in place of the Giants.\n\nBut Landis said the World Series could go ahead. Johnson, the American League commissioner, refused to attend any of the games.\n\nFor previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/john-kelly.\n\nAD", "description": "When Mollie wanted to propose to Greg, she had an out-of-this-world idea.", "authors": ["John Kelly", "Local Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/SjN9958MaLRYuimmieQr_Q-9DXc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HY2IBVXU44I6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
