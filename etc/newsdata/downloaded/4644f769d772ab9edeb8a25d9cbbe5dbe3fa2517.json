(pic: LetsGoDigital)\n\nDevkits rarely look like the actual consumer version of the console though and can range from everything from an anonymous looking desktop PC to the infamous big giant \u2018X\u2019 of the original Xbox.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat being so, Wired asked what the actual PlayStation 5 looked like, but Sony refused to say whether it was in any way similar to the devkit.\n\nOther developers, such as a Codemasters employee who quickly deleted his tweet, have also confirmed that the devkit image is real but that doesn\u2019t really help with trying to guess the console\u2019s appearance.\n\nAlthough, let\u2019s face it, based on the long history of video game console design it\u2019s almost certainly just going to be a big black box.\n\nPerhaps the only useful question raised by the devkit is whether that big \u2018V\u2019 shape will be on the consumer version, and if Sony will actually be referring to it as the PlayStation V \u2013 as in the Roman numeral.\n\nThis is the original patent image (pic: LetsGoDigital)\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: PlayStation 5 name and Christmas 2020 release date confirmed\n\nMORE: Sony patent shows PlayStation 5 devkit \u2013 or maybe even the console itself\n\nMORE: Sony planning to acquire more game developers for PlayStation 5", "description": "The dev kit that developers use to make PS5 games really does have a giant \u2018V\u2019 carved into it, as a new render of the device is released.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/playstation-5-770x535-696b_1570548192.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
