An \u201coverpowered glitch\u201d has been found where players won\u2019t take any fall damage.\n\n\u2018Disabling\u2019 fall damage\n\nThe YouTube channel of Glitch King recently uploaded a short clip showing how the glitch is done.\n\nPer the video, players need to \u201cdisable\u201d the game\u2019s fall damage by simply entering any zipline on the map that is above any body of water. There are a lot of these ziplines on the map where the glitch can be performed (the YouTuber even showed their locations on the game\u2019s new map).\n\nAs mentioned above, one must enter the zipline, jump, and fall straight into the water. According to the YouTuber, the glitch was done right if the so-called purple effect (\u201cno fall damage effect\u201d) is still with the character. King pointed out, however, that if you jump on the ground, the glitch will be disabled (jumping in the water won\u2019t turn it off).\n\nVisual/graphical glitch in both Magma and Slurp! Wraps\n\nAside from game-breaking glitches/exploits, players also encountered some bugs in the game. One is some sort of a visual bug in the Magma Wrap. Reddit user u/TheMewZe took to r/FortNiteBR to raise such concerns and call out Epic Games about it. The post gained a lot of traction on the subreddit and the developer took notice of it and addressed the issue.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news! Click on the topic you interest most. We'll keep you updated with all the news you shouldn't miss. Fortnite Video Game\n\nAn Epic employee responded to it and admitted that it\u2019s \u201ca bug rather than a design change.\u201d The staff assured the \u201cFortnite\u201d community that they are working on the said issue to make the Wrap look the way it should. In line with this, another member of the same subreddit brought to light a similar issue with the Slurp! Wrap.\n\nLocating loot llamas, the Tfue way\n\nMeanwhile, known \u201cFortnite\u201d pro Tfue may have figured out a way to locate those hard-to-find supply llamas in the game.\n\nHe just jumped off Battle Bus and did not immediately dive down to battle. Instead, he stayed in the air for a bit and started pinging random areas on the map that resulted in uncovering the loot llamas.\n\nAccording to Dexerto, supply llamas were \u201cfar more common\u201d back then compared to the game\u2019s second chapter. He added that other pro players are doing tricks similar to Tfue\u2019s before a game. The website speculated that these items may become even more difficult to locate as Chapter 2 progresses, not to mention that more items are expected to be introduced in \u201cFortnite.\u201d", "description": "A YouTuber may have discovered another trick in 'Fortnite BR' that seem to disable fall damage.", "authors": ["Milos Kitanovic", "Jane Flowers", "Oliver Vandervoort", "Read More On The Same Topic E.
