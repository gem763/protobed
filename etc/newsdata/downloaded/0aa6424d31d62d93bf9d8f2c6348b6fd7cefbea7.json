Surrounded by a swarm of local kids, some barely knee-high in height, the World Cup winner is bringing order to chaos. He\u2019s got two on either side of him, hands locked together, gently guiding them this way and that as they attempt to round up the loose players buzzing around like flies. The more they catch, the longer the line gets.\n\nNearby is Lawrence Dallaglio. His approach is less calm and composed. A bull in a china shop, he\u2019s practically dragging his team mates forward with him as he goes. He\u2019s roaring at the same time, eyes wide as saucers. For those children hanging off his arms, the fear of god in their hearts, this is the safest place to be as he charges around the pitch.\n\nIn this leafy corner of Tokyo, away from the neon shimmer of the city\u2019s pulsing centre, with its scrambled intersections and endless flow of people, it\u2019s hard to resist the nostalgia \u2013 especially on a week like this. As the nation looks forward to Saturday night and the promises of new glory, Wilkinson and Dallaglio remain tangible links to the past, to an age when England ruled the world.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe context might be a little bit different this time \u2013 the two men are introducing young Japanese children to the basics of rugby as part of the tournament\u2019s legacy initiatives \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t stop the sights and sounds from 16 years ago popping up in the mind\u2019s eye.\n\nAs for that winning moment in Sydney, you can still see it as clear as day. The initial snipe and break from Matt Dawson to take play into Australia\u2019s 22. The recycle, the pass out to Wilkinson, then the long pause in time and space that followed as the ball sailed majestically through the posts. \u201cJust relief,\u201d Martin Johnson would say a few years later. \u201cHonestly sheer relief. You\u2019d have never forgiven yourself for losing that match because it was there for us to win.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Zealand in the Rugby World Cup semi-final AP\n\nBut for all the talk of building on this legacy, of adding another layer to the sporting palimpsest, there\u2019s no doubt that today\u2019s England team are on their \u201cown journey of discovery\u201d \u2013 as Dallaglio puts it. And for Wilkinson, the comparisons stop beyond the jersey.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my era and it\u2019s important to establish that rugby has moved on,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like comparing us to the mid-90s and it\u2019s always going to look different, rightly so.\u201d Still, that won\u2019t stop him from singing the praises of Eddie Jones\u2019 men, drawing particular attention to last weekend\u2019s 19-7 semi-final win over New Zealand \u2013 a performance that some are describing as the most complete English display ever.\n\nWilkinson talks eagerly and quickly about it, about \u201cthe energy at the top end\u201d, of the \u201crelentless, on-the-edge\u201d nature of the performance, of the \u201cclarity of the decision-making\u201d. It\u2019s safe to say he was left impressed by what he saw. \u201cI can imagine they didn\u2019t even want to know they had won it at the end,\u201d he says. \u201cYou want to be in that battle. I think there was a brilliant completeness around that, technically outstanding.\n\n\u201cEvery player dominated his area of the game in terms of what he\u2019s supposed to do. And therefore you add that together and you get a machine that looks very well-oiled. Then you\u2019ve got the ability to respond that they had, when they saw opportunities and they just went. It was inspired.\u201d\n\nThe challenge now is recreating that magic to consign South Africa to a similar fate \u2013 something which Wilkinson urges England against getting too hung up on.\n\n\u201cThe problem is if you start comparing this performance to the last one, you are adding a known in there and think, \u2018This is what we\u2019ve got to do, this is where we\u2019ve got to play, we\u2019ve got to get this week to be like last week.\u2019 And it just completely shuts off the potential for a similar performance, which is what you want. Go out, start again.\n\n\u201cThat game looked for me like a one-off. This game also has to be a one-off. And I think the coaches are great at creating an environment where the players feel fresh, renewed, still connected to their learnings, but not just weighed down by them.\u201d\n\nBut with six days between the win over New Zealand and Saturday\u2019s showcase, the challenge facing Jones\u2019 player is as psychological as it is physical. The hours will drag, stretched out under the dizzying anticipation of what is to come. With immortality within reaching distance, the danger lies in looking beyond the 80 minutes and envisioning life as a World Cup winner.\n\n\u201cYou just start to get ahead of yourself and start to think what it would be like at the end,\u201d Wilkinson adds. \u201cIf you start thinking this is the end of a long journey, it just gets slower and slower.\n\n\u201cAll I can say from my experience is that when you get to the end, you would swap it in a heartbeat to go back into the middle of the performance that led to it. When you are walking around with the cup, you think everything is great. But it doesn\u2019t add up to being in the middle of the action, which is where it counts.\u201d\n\nAs for what England can expect against the Springboks, Wilkinson points to the children behind him. \u201c[South Africa] make you feel like there are 20 of them,\u201d he says, smiling at the same time.\n\n\u201cThey are a very smothering team, really get around you and make you think the pitch is tiny. And they are enormously explosive. Which means that very, very small moments can turn into big moments. A little dropped ball here, you get caught behind the gain line, a big hit, and all of a sudden, within two seconds they have piled over the ruck, got the ball, they are 50-60 meters downfield.\n\n\u201cAnd they can dominate a momentum change like that. It\u2019s important England manage those moments, but at the same time you don\u2019t want to get into an arm-wrestle with these guys like Wales did. It\u2019s very difficult when you are in a tight game to branch out and start getting into a wider game. When you are in a wider game, you can always bring it in.\u201d\n\nBut for all the scrutiny and introspection that accompanies a week like this, as questions are raised of tactics and selection choices, with past performances and meetings re-examined, and former players asked for their twopence, Wilkinson insists England\u2019s history-chasers should take a moment to pause and reflect on the moment, to embrace the journey of where they\u2019ve been and where they\u2019re headed.\n\n\u201cYou are so close to arriving, you want to arrive but the last thing you ever want to do in life is arrive,\u201d he says, \u201cand I think these guys are on their way somewhere.\u201d\n\nLand Rover is Official Worldwide Partner of Rugby World Cup 2019.
