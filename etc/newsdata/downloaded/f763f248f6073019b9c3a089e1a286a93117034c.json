A good friend of ours had bought an Oculus Quest VR, the first untethered VR system (I believe), and had me try it out before we went out to see a movie together. He practically had to pry it off my head to get me to go, and his wife called my wife to warn her that I\u2019d be looking for my own soon.\n\n\u201cIf it gets him out of his damn chair and exercising,\u201d my wife replied, \u201cthen I\u2019m all for it.\u201d The next day, we went together to pick one up. After a week, I\u2019ve formed some conclusions about the system \u2014 some good, some not quite so, and some still evolving but hopeful. A holiday weekend seems like a good time to open up a thread and share the experience with readers.\n\nLearning curve\n\nThe system comes in two options: 64GB and 128GB. The games are not terribly large, so the smaller system might fit some folks\u2019 budget better at ~$400. If you can go an extra $100, get the larger capacity, as it will reduce your need to manage your library. The headset sits snugly on the head with rubber straps that make me glad I shave my head. It\u2019s comfortable, but it only offers a very limited amount of adjustment for vision correction. However, it can be worn with most eyeglasses and comes with a spacer for that purpose that\u2019s easily installed.\n\nTo use this properly, you will need a significant amount of free space. Among the first steps is to set up your \u201cguardian,\u201d a map of the play space and its boundaries. (This will happen every time, but if you use the same space as your previous session, it will only ask you to confirm it.) All of the apps and games will signal if you or your controllers get too close to these boundaries, and it is very important to pay attention to those warnings if you have objects or stairs near to those edges. Some games simply will not work well if you don\u2019t have enough maneuvering room. A 6\u2019x6\u2032 square is minimum, so consider that when thinking about buying an Oculus. Also, this is not recommended for outside use \u2014 and direct sunlight can damage the headset anyway.\n\nThe Oculus Quest is not altogether intuitive, especially not for middle-aged non-gamers such as yours truly. However, the system comes with free applications and games that help users learn and adjust to both the VR environment and the controllers. First Steps and Oculus First Contact allow new users to get a feel for both in an untimed experience. It\u2019s not a bad idea to run through both at least a couple of times to get the hang of things, and both are fun in their own ways for a little while.\n\nEventually, though, users will want to jump into games and apps. Those have their own navigation quirks and have to be learned by doing, which at times seems a little frustrating. A couple of times, I paraphrased Sgt. Hulka from Stripes and asked myself, Am I getting too old for this s***? The answer is mainly no, except perhaps when it comes to \u2026\n\nExercise\n\nThe last game system I bought was the Wii, and I bought it for the same reason \u2014 because I dislike exercise unless it\u2019s entertaining. The Wii wasn\u2019t all that satisfying in that regard, and I eventually stopped using it. My granddaughters used it a bit more than I did, but they moved on to better platforms at home.\n\nI bought this for exercise and entertainment, but primarily to incentivize myself into some regular physical activity. My first game purchases have been focused on that goal, but fortunately they\u2019ve provided both in differing degrees.\n\nCreed \u2013 This boxing game provides a number of \u201cgym\u201d exercises as well as boxing bouts. I\u2019ve only fought two bouts (so far) but they were exhausting. The gym activities allows users to pace themselves more. If you\u2019re not in good cardio shape, this game will wear you out fast.\n\nVader Immortal: I\u2019ve tried playing the main game a bit, but it\u2019s a lengthy narrative experience. The light-saber exercise (think Luke in Episode IV with the floating ball) is tremendous fun and a pretty good all-body workout.\n\nSpace Pirate Trainer: Fun arcade-ish shooter game which forces you to dodge incoming fire and keep your attention up. Not necessarily an intensive exercise, but nonetheless fun and a few rounds provide a moderate workout. The demo comes free with the system.\n\nDrop Dead: This zombie game is more fun than exercise, until you have to use hand weapons to strike at them up close. That\u2019s when it wears you out. It\u2019s also a lot of fun.\n\nRacket NX: A futuristic racquetball game, it\u2019s addictive and more tiring than it first seems. One mode plays basically forever, so it\u2019s easy to lose time with this game. One such session left me dripping with sweat and a sore shoulder, so middle-aged dudes like myself should probably watch themselves.\n\nNone of these provide weight training, of course, but they all provide good cardio workouts. Most of these involve the whole body rather than just the arms or the hands, at least within the boundaries of the guardian.\n\nVR Experience\n\nIt\u2019s very different playing games in VR than on a television screen, and that can be quite disorienting at times. Most of the above games don\u2019t present that kind of problem, but others might. Some apps run in different \u201ccomfort\u201d modes to accommodate those with motion-sickness issues, and all games come with comfort ratings to warn users before they buy. I made the mistake of running the free version of Epic Roller Coasters while standing up, and nearly crashed into my coffee table while falling over. That\u2019s one game among several where it might be better to play sitting down, if at all.\n\nWhen Jazz found out I\u2019d bought this system, he told me to check out YouTube for all the user fails like this. I politely declined, and \u2026 I\u2019m glad I did.\n\nDrawbacks\n\nI\u2019ve really enjoyed the system and I\u2019m looking forward to continued use of it. There are a few minor quirks that are worth noting, almost all of which will be resolved over time anyway.\n\nSmall selection of programs \u2013 The Quest just came out three months ago, so it will take some time for gamemakers to adapt existing programs and add new ones for the Quest. Still, I was hoping for more traditional sports-game programs like tennis, bowling, golf, baseball, etc. At the moment, the only thing that comes close is Sports Scramble, which does exactly what its title suggests. The demo\u2019s free but it\u2019s too weird to buy, IMO. I\u2019m hoping to see more of these kinds of titles by Christmas.\n\nProgram exits \u2013 There are none, at least in most games. You have to exit from them by bailing out, which then requires you to \u201cquit\u201d the halted game from the main system menu. It feels a bit like an Alt-F4 in the Windows world, although the app does still save your data. I didn\u2019t realize that this was actually the correct process until I saw the video below.\n\nMovies/TV \u2014 The Oculus Quest has apps from most streaming services that will connect to your accounts quickly and easily. However, it quickly becomes apparent that the quality falls below commonly available hi-def TVs these days. Unless you\u2019re watching 360\u00ba videos (Amazon and Netflix both have a few), don\u2019t bother.\n\nSide load \u2013 This is an Android-based system, but it\u2019s semi-closed. You can find side load programs to add Android apps, but it\u2019s a dicey proposition. I used SideQuest to add a 3D version of Minesweeper, which won\u2019t run. This will likely improve over time, and I have to admit that I\u2019m probably part of the problem here, but it would be nicer to have an interface from Oculus for this purpose.\n\nOverall, though, I\u2019ve been very happy with this purchase, even if I am perhaps getting a little too old to become a gamer. If you\u2019re like me and hate exercising but love being entertained, you could do much worse than the Oculus Quest VR system. It\u2019s a lot more fun than a stationary bicycle, and that makes me a very satisfied \u2014 and tired \u2014 customer.\n\nNote: I paid full price for all components in this review, and have received no compensation at all from any of the providers.", "description": "Am I getting too old for this ****?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "Taylor Millard", "Andrew Malcolm", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oculus-quest.png"}
