And honestly, same.\n\nYes, it is me, Pedestrian\u2019s resident horny animal expert back with another story of pets doing the sex.\n\nXiaopi, a Russian Blue cat from China, was left at a pet hotel for one night (October 1) while his owners went on their own vacation, the New Zealand Herald reports. Yes, Russian Blue cats are the kind of fancy cats that require a hotel when you go on holidays, rather than just asking your sister to come over and feed him.\n\nBut if you thought one night in a hotel wasn\u2019t enough to get up to some mischief, you clearly haven\u2019t seen The Hangover.\n\nThe horny cat\u2019s owner Mr Zhao had warned the pet hotel that his precious Xiaopi had not been desexed before commencing his stay at the hotel, but the staff didn\u2019t take this into account when they let him out to freely interact (fucc) the other cats.\n\n\u201cI thought they\u2019d be professional, but the staff member didn\u2019t feed Xiaopi during the day and let him out to roam freely at night,\u201d Mr Zhao said in a statement on social media. \u201cThat\u2019s right, all the cats were free to walk around the shop and then the employee went home.\u201d\n\nObviously, Xiaopi\u2019s natural instincts took over and well\u2026 he got frisky with at least five cats.\n\n\u201cBetween around 10.40pm and 5am, my cat mated with five female cats. And those are only the ones I could see in the CCTV footage.\u201d\n\nYep, there was even CCTV footage, so poor Xiaopi\u2019s horned-up night of fun will forever be saved on film for his owners to cringe at.\n\nBut it gets worse because even after letting his cat out on a sexcapade, the hotel allegedly blamed Mr Zhao for the ordeal and wanted him to explain it to the other owners.\n\n\u201cThey had the nerve to be upset with me. They wanted me to explain the situation to all the other owners,\u201d he said. \u201cMy f***ing cat is exhausted and on a glucose drip, and this is my fault?\u201d\n\nEventually, the hotel apologised to Mr Zhao and offered to pay for Xiaopi\u2019s treatment and hospital stay, which included fluid therapy. They have also offered financial compensation to the owners of the cats that Xiaopi got pregnant during the accident.\n\nRussian Blue kittens can sell for $850-$1200 in Australia, so these accidental offspring could be worth some serious cash.\n\nThankfully, Xiaopi has made a full recovery from his sexed-up hotel visit, but likely won\u2019t be leaving the house any time soon.", "description": "A Russian Blue cat in China has gone on a sex rampage at a pet hotel while his owners her on holidays and gotten frisky with five cats in one night.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/pjimage-47.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
