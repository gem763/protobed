His 2015 victory reasserted liberalism in Canada after almost 10 years of Conservative government and his presidency has been viewed as a beacon for liberals in the era of Donald Trump.\n\nHowever, political scandals involving attempted interference in the justice system and the resurfacing of old photos of Mr Trudeau in blackface and brownface have cast doubt on his judgement.\n\nIn the interference scandal, Mr Trudeau\u2019s former attorney general said he pressured her to halt the prosecution of a Quebec company, causing the Conservatives to call for the prime minister\u2019s resignation.\n\nOn Wednesday, Barack Obama made an intervention unprecedented by a former US president when he urged Canadians to re-elect Mr Trudeau.\n\n\u201cThe world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbours to the north support him for another term,\u201d Mr Obama wrote.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Mr Trudeau's Liberals would likely rely on the New Democrats to stay in power.\n\nHis rival, opposition leader Andrew Scheer, is a career politician who has been described by those in his own party as bland. Mr Scheer has called Mr Trudeau a \"phony\" and a \"fraud\" who does \u201cnot deserve to govern this country\u201d.\n\nJason Kenney, Alberta's premier and a close friend of Mr Scheer, calls the Conservative leader \"an extremely normal Canadian\" who is so nice he \"can't fake being mean\".\n\nAt a rally on Saturday, Conservative Party supporters chanted \u201cLock him up!\u201d after the opposition leader said he would investigate Mr Trudeau\u2019s interference scandal, mirroring the \u201cLock her up!\u201d chants used against Hillary Clinton at Trump rallies.\n\nMr Scheer, who appeared uncomfortable with the chant, tried to get the crowd to stop and told them to use the phrase \u201cVote him out\u201d instead.\n\nMr Trudeau\u2019s liberal government has legalised cannabis nationwide and embraced immigration, at a time when the US and other countries have introduced stricter border controls.\n\nHe has also attempted to balance environmental reforms with protecting the economy, leading to criticism from both the right and left of Canadian politics.\n\nMr Scheer has campaigned on promises to end Mr Trudeau\u2019s carbon tax and cut government spending, including foreign aid, by 25 per cent.\n\n\"That money belongs to you, not to them,\u201d Mr Scheer said.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Justin Trudeau is at risk of losing power after a single term as Canadians head to vote following a bruising election campaign and the prime minister's blackface scandal.
