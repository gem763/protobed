But the problems have continued through an expensive summer rebuilding campaign and an unconvincing start to the Spanish league.\n\nInjuries haven't helped. Luka Modric, Gareth Bale, Toni Kroos and Lucas V\u00e1zquez are all doubtful for the game against Galatasaray.\n\nMadrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois has faced heavy criticism amid questions from supporters over why he was preferred to Keylor Navas, who joined PSG in the offseason.\n\nNavas will hope to maintain another clean sheet for PSG in Bruges, which is unbeaten in six Champions League games.\n\nGROUP B\n\nTottenham reached last season's final despite claiming just one point from its opening three games, but Mauricio Pochettino's team will not want to repeat the attempt after conceding seven goals in a home game for the first time.\n\nBayern's 7-2 win leaves Tottenham with one point from its opening two games and the Premier League team will be keen to restore some lost pride when Red Star Belgrade visits.\n\nDespite domestic setbacks, Bayern will be confident of maintaining its winning start to the Champions League with another victory at Olympiakos in Greece.\n\nGROUP C\n\nManchester City has won its last five games at home in European competition and Atalanta seems unlikely to stop that run after losing both games on its tournament debut.\n\nCity coach Pep Guardiola played for Atalanta's bitter rivals Brescia, offering the visitors more motivation for causing an upset.\n\nShakhtar Donetsk hosts Dinamo Zagreb in the other group game.\n\nGROUP D\n\nAtl\u00e9tico Madrid will be without star forward Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix when it hosts Leverkusen and tries to stay top of its group with Juventus, which hosts Lokomotiv Moscow. F\u00e9lix sprained his right ankle on Saturday.\n\nAtl\u00e9tico, unbeaten in its last 11 matches at home in European competitions, eliminated Leverkusen in the Round of 16 of the Champions League in 2016-17.\n\nLeverkusen is hoping to get off the mark after losing both of its opening games \u2014 2-1 at home to Lokomotiv Moscow and 3-0 at Juventus.\n\nGROUP E\n\nGenk is braced for a possible reaction Wednesday from Liverpool, whose winning Premier League start ended at Old Trafford.\n\nLiverpool opened its Champions League defense with a 2-0 loss at Napoli and struggled before prevailing 4-3 over Salzburg.\n\nSalzburg has tallied nine goals so far but the Austrian club faces a difficult challenge against Napoli, which is one of five teams yet to concede in the competition.\n\nGROUP F\n\nInter Milan hosts Borussia Dortmund knowing it can't afford to fall further behind as three heavyweights are vying for two spots.\n\nAntonio Conte's team already trails Barcelona and Dortmund by three points.\n\nBarcelona goes into its game at Slavia Prague coming off five straight victories in all competitions, the latest a 3-0 rout of Eibar on Saturday that took the Catalan team top of the Spanish league.\n\nPrague is bottom of the group on goal difference from Inter after claiming a point in their opening 1-1 draw in Italy.\n\nGROUP G\n\nLeipzig hosts Zenit St. Petersburg on Wednesday after seemingly forgetting how to win at home, where its last victory was against Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga on Aug. 25.\n\nLyon managed to win 2-0 in Leipzig despite its own crisis at home. Lyon hasn't won in eight games in the French league.\n\nLyon visits Benfica in the group's other game.\n\nGROUP H\n\nAjax hosts in-form Chelsea, which will hope to create more painful English memories for the Dutch club.\n\nTottenham denied Ajax a place in last season's final with a last-gasp goal, and Ajax has lost four of its last six home games against English teams.\n\nDespite losing some of its best players in the offseason, Ajax has shown little ill-effect, going on to enjoy 3-0 wins over both Lille and Valencia.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Andrew Dampf in Rome and Tales Azzoni in Madrid contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nCiar\u00e1n Fahey on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cfaheyAP\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
