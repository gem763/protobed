The stock fell sharply last week after the company issued a revenue warning for its fiscal fourth quarter and pulled its fiscal 2020 outlook. The news served as a reminder that the Canadian sector is not yet creating any profit thanks to a still powerful black market and the slow rollout of stores, sending stocks lower across the board.\n\nSeaport downgraded Hexo and Canopy Growth CGC, -2.93% WEED, -5.49% to neutral from buy and maintained Aurora Cannabis ACB, -4.62% ACB, -2.02% and Tilray TLRY, -1.43% as neutral, leaving Aphria Inc. APHA, -7.43% APHA, +0.32% as the only buy-rated stock among the Canadian cannabis stocks in its coverage. Analysts Brett M. Hundley and Luke Perda said they have placed their model, rating and price target for Green Organic Dutchman TGODF, +0.00% TGOD, +7.21% on review, pending news on its efforts to raise fresh financing.\n\n\u201cAs for the U.S. multistate operator group, we see a completely different set of circumstances in place, and we would broadly recommend that investors rotate away from Canada and toward the U.S., the analysts wrote in a note to clients. \u201cWe do not think that recent vape headlines will materially cut into forward MSO financials, and we see a number of opportunities for public MSOs on the horizon.\u201d\n\nSee: \u2018Don\u2019t smoke the Kool-Aid,\u2019 analyst says in sober note on the cannabis sector\n\nThe analysts said they are disappointed with Hexo\u2019s development of its hub-and-spoke model \u201cand we wonder if the latter is even possible for marijuana, specifically, any more.\u201d They were further disappointed by the departure of Chief Financial Officer Michael Monahan, who quit on Oct. 4, to seek a better work/life balance.\n\nIn Canopy\u2019s case, the analysts said they no longer expect the company to receive incremental equity warrant funding from Constellation Brands STZ, -0.06%, the brewer of Corona beer that is Canopy\u2019s biggest single shareholder following a $4 billion investment last year.\n\n\u201c This added cash assumption had been a core tenet of our buy rating under our valuation analysis,\u201d the wrote.\n\nCanopy stock was down 3.6%.\n\nAurora Cannabis shares fell 2.3%, as Seaport tweaked estimates and MKM lowered its stock price target to C$C$3.50 ($2.65) from C$5.00.\n\n\u201cThe company has said that it is tracking toward Ebitda profitability, but we expect the landscape to get much tougher, ahead,\u201d wrote the Seaport analysts. \u201cACB is in the process of fleshing out an expensive asset base in Canada and Denmark, against markets that are anticipated to open slowly. Now more than ever, we believe that Canadian LPs need to maintain a low cost structure while also maintaining appropriate capital/cash reserves.\u201d\n\nMKM analyst Bill Kirk reiterated his sell rating on the stock citing softer prices for cannabis, a widening gap between the price of legal pot and black market product and fewer-than-expected new store openings in Quebec and Ontario.\n\n\u201cAurora warned on its September 12th earnings call that July and August had slowed, and including Hexo Corp\u2019s commentary and pace of new stores, we have no evidence that September and early October were any better,\u201d Kirk wrote in a note to clients.\n\nSee also: Cannabis stocks pare early gains as profit doubts persist a day after major selloff\n\nThe analyst lowered his first-quarter fiscal 2020 sales estimate to C$98 million from a previous C$117 million, below the C$105 million consensus. \u201cWe believe profitability for cultivators will generally get worse before getting better,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPricing is already decreasing and supply availability will continue to grow/improve.\u201d\n\nSee now: Mitch McConnell meets with pot execs in California, pitched need for cannabis banking reform\n\nIn other news on the sector, the two Ukrainian businessmen tied to President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, former New York City Mayor Rudi Giuliani, who were arrested last week and charged with federal campaign finance violations, have also been indicted in a U.S. cannabis corruption scheme, according to news site Leafly.\n\nThe pair, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman along with another Soviet-born U.S. citizen Andrey Kukushkin, were charged with working on behalf of a foreign national to try to elect two Nevada candidates to gain favor in getting recreational licenses.\n\nCannTrust shares CTST, +13.30% TRST, +1.69% reversed early losses to trade up 15.7%, after the company said it is taking steps to regain its licenses after they were suspended in a scandal involving illegal grow rooms. As part of those measures, the company said it would destroy C$12 million of biological assets and about $65 million worth of inventory that was not authorized by its licence. The material to be destroyed includes product that was returned by patients, distributors and retailers.\n\nAphria was down 9.6%, Aleafia ALEAF, -0.85% ALEF, -1.25% was down 2.5%, OGI, +3.16% was up 3% and KushCo KSHB, -4.17% was down 3.5%.
