Finally, ReImagine your City will be overseen by architect Dara Huang, and will deal with London\u2019s buildings and infrastructure.\n\nThe initiative is part of Lego\u2019s Rebuild the World campaign, which aims to prepare children for the future job market by encouraging them to use their imagination and creativity more.\n\nKids have already tried to redesign a British telephone box\n\nIn the UK this has already seen workshops set-up to rebuild iconic British landmarks \u2013 from telephone boxes to the Birmingham bullring \u2013 but with the National Park City Partnership they\u2019ll be encouraged to reimagine the whole city, with more green spaces, better public transport, and other more futuristic additions.\n\n\u2018Our mission is to encourage more people to enjoy the great outdoors by creating safe, green and wild spaces that children can explore and play in\u2019, said London National Park City\u2019s Daniel Raven-Ellison.\n\n\u2018Through this partnership with the Lego Group we are giving kids the power to imagine and bring to life what they\u2019d like from the city they live in.
