According to his proposal, which was released on August 26th, it\u2019ll take 20 years, $4.87 trillion, and maybe even space mirrors to prevent a climate catastrophe.\n\nSimilar to other Democratic candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, Yang wants the US to get to net-zero carbon emissions by midcentury \u2014 although he tries to one-up their plans by setting a goal of 2049 rather than 2050. Achieving net-zero emissions means that the country would successfully capture as much carbon as it puts into the environment. To get there, the US would need to significantly cut down on its use of fossil fuels, ramp up renewable energy, and employ methods to trap the planet-warming gases we\u2019ve already released into the atmosphere over the years.\n\nlooking into \u201cgiant foldable space mirrors\u201d that would reflect the sun\u2019s light away from the earth\n\nThat last part is where Yang\u2019s plan starts to get a little wonky, but it\u2019s totally on brand for the startup entrepreneur. He\u2019s the only candidate whose plan to avert the climate crisis banks on geoengineering (aka developing technologies to manipulate the environment). His plan would invest $800 million* in researching geoengineering methods like space mirrors. That\u2019s right, he\u2019s looking into \u201cgiant foldable space mirrors\u201d that would reflect the Sun\u2019s light away from the Earth as a \u201clast resort.\u201d\n\nRelated Andrew Yang is the candidate for the end of the world\n\nIt\u2019s all part of Yang\u2019s ambition to ensure that the US is the global leader in green technologies. \u201cWe\u2019re the most entrepreneurial country in the history of the world. It\u2019s time to activate the American imagination and work ethic to provide the innovation and technology that will power the rest of the world,\u201d he writes in his plan.\n\nYang wants to spend $45 billion to create a \u201cNational Lab\u201d underneath a new Department of Technology. Its central purpose would be to research new ideas on how to stave off climate change.\n\nThe $800 million* geoengineering line item will likely get the most attention, but by far the most expensive of Yang\u2019s aims is to spend $3 trillion in financing loans for households to transition to renewable energy over the next 20 years. That alone is nearly twice as much as Joe Biden\u2019s entire $1.7 trillion climate proposal. Yang\u2019s plan also includes $200 billion to modernize the nation\u2019s power grid and more than $330 billion to get ground and air transportation to net-zero emissions. To get some of that money back, Yang\u2019s plan would place a carbon tax on polluters starting at $40 per ton of carbon emitted and increasing each year thereafter.\n\nYang\u2019s plan includes a timeline to get new nuclear reactors online by 2027\n\nYang\u2019s most controversial climate stance might be his support for ramping up nuclear energy. His plan includes a timeline to get new nuclear reactors online by 2027, and he wants to invest $50 billion in researching new technologies that he believes would eliminate many of the risks posed by older nuclear infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t dismiss any ideas,\u201d Yang writes. \u201cWe\u2019ve waited too long, so we need to act fast and recognize that all options need to be on the table.\u201d Yang\u2019s comments echo critiques of Bernie Sanders\u2019 recently proposed version of a \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d which is the first to explicitly exclude nuclear energy, geoengineering, and carbon capture technologies.\n\nSome environmental activists have criticized these Yang-approved ideas on the grounds that they don\u2019t wean the US off of fossil fuels or address the public health concerns connected with oil, gas, and uranium supply chains. \u201cFor us, the best way to deal with climate crisis is to reduce the amount of carbon emissions instead of putting on a Band-Aid approach,\u201d says Jos\u00e9 Bravo, executive director of the Just Transition Alliance, a coalition of environmental justice and labor organizations. \u201cWe can\u2019t move forward with any plan that does not take into consideration the legacy that dirty energy has left in our communities and the cleanup that needs to happen as well.\u201d\n\nYang does have expert backing for some of his ambitions. The United Nations\u2019 panel of climate scientists concluded that capturing carbon and increasing nuclear energy is necessary in order to reach global goals set by the Paris climate agreement. But the UN\u2019s most recent report remains agnostic on the issue of geoengineering, citing insufficient research on its effectiveness and the consequences it might have on the planet.\n\nSteven Cohen, director of the research program on sustainability policy and management at Columbia University\u2019s Earth Institute, takes Yang\u2019s plan with a grain of salt. \u201cI think that he\u2019s essentially on the right track to focus on science and technology, but I think that his faith in technology may be a little bit misplaced,\u201d Cohen tells The Verge. According to Cohen, it\u2019s not so bad that Yang wants to spur research into still-unproven technologies like carbon capture and geoengineering. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to do the research ... but another thing to count on it to save the world.\u201d\n\n*Correction 8/27: A previous version of this article stated that the budget for geoengineering was $200 million. The plan budgets $800 million for geoengineering.
