USA TODAY\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 He's the one that got away for the New York Yankees.\n\nThe Yankees first laid eyes on him more than a decade ago, fell deeply in love, proposed, and were ready to exchange vows.\n\nBut for the past 11 years and four months, Gerrit Cole has done nothing but break the Yankees\u2019 hearts.\n\nHe spurned the Yankees after they drafted him in the first round of the 2008 draft, choosing the college life at UCLA instead.\n\nStill infatuated, and seeing an opening, the Yankees strongly started pursuing him again two years ago.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates announced they were breaking up with him, but instead of sending him to New York, traded him to the Houston Astros.\n\nALCS: Correa loses his mind after saving Astros' season\n\nMLB PLAYOFFS: Our idea for a new postseason award\n\nNow, putting out their feelings for the world to see, the Yankees once again are bracing themselves for heartbreak.\n\nOn Tuesday, the hottest pitcher in the game, takes the mound for the Houston Astros in Game 3 of the American League Championship Series at Yankee Stadium.\n\nIn his last 22 starts, Cole is 18-0 with a 1.66 ERA. He has 251 strikeouts in 162 \u2153 innings, yielding a .125 batting average.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of anyone I\u2019d rather pitch in this game,\u2019\u2019 Astros second baseman Jose Altuve said. \u201cCome on, who\u2019s better? And he loves this kind of situation.\u2019\u2019\n\nCole won Games 2 and 5 in the ALDS against Tampa Bay. (Photo: Troy Taormina, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nReally, the most intrigue in this game may not be the outcome, but how the Yankees' crowd reacts.\n\nDo they taunt him, jeer him and try to rattle him like any prideful Yankee fan knowing he can singlehandedly damper their World Series aspirations? Or are they on their best behavior, knowing they\u2019ll have one final chance to wed this winter?\n\nHe\u2019ll be a free agent, and to assure he lives happily ever after in New York, all it costs is cold, hard cash.\n\n\u201cHe is going to blow the doors off,\u2019\u2019 Astros teammate Wade Miley says. \u201cOh, my God, you think someone will give him $300 million? How about $260 million?\u2019\u2019\n\nCole, 29, is that good, and is just about a lock to eclipse David Price\u2019s record setting contract with the Boston Red Sox \u2013 $217 million over seven years.\n\nWill the Yankees, who desperately need an ace, shell out that kind of money?\n\nHow about the Texas Rangers who are moving into their fancy new digs?\n\nThe St. Louis Cardinals could have a knockout 1-2 punch with Jack Flaherty.\n\nHey, if Anthony Rendon doesn\u2019t take the Washington Nationals' money, why not give it to Cole?\n\nCould the Astros become the first team to have a $90 million trio of starters in Justin Verlander, Zack Greinke and Cole?\n\nWhy not a bidding war in Los Angeles between the Dodgers and Angels?\n\nCole, with players whispering sweet-nothings in his ear during the All-Star break, and dropping subtle recruiting hints throughout the year, is trying his best to keep a poker face, refusing to reveal his hand.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u2019\u2019 Cole says. \u201cThat\u2019s a question I\u2019d be more prepared to answer in the offseason. I\u2019m not really focused on that now.\u2019\u2019\n\nYet, those in the Astros\u2019 clubhouse believe they know the vicinity where he\u2019s headed, with outfielder Josh Reddick boldly predicting, \u201cIt will be west of Nevada.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cWe know he wants to be a West Coast guy,\u2019\u2019 Reddick says. \u201cHe\u2019s a California guy, so he probably wants to be close to home. I know he mentioned Oakland a couple of times because of how he\u2019s pitched there in the past.\n\n\u201cBut that probably won\u2019t happen. They\u2019d have to clear the whole roster to afford him.\n\n\u201cIt makes you wonder what teams are going to be able to afford him, because there\u2019s so many teams that can\u2019t afford somebody like that.\u2019\u2019\n\nPredictions, anyone?\n\n\u201cI got the Angels,\u2019\u2019 Miley says, \u201cand paying him at least $250 million.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd sticking a dagger into the Yankees\u2019 hearts one final time.\n\nThe Yankees\u2019 attraction to Cole more than a decade agol, convinced he had the makings to be a star. Scouting director Damon Oppenheimer was among those at the game when Cole nearly threw a no-hitter for Orange Lutheran, firing 96-mph fastballs, only for a kid named Shane Boras to break it up with an opposite-field single. That kid\u2019s father, Scott Boras, became Cole\u2019s advisor and agent.\n\nThe Yankees drafted him with the 28th pick in 2008, and figured it would be no problem signing. Besides, didn\u2019t Cole tell them he always loved the Yankees? He was the 11-year-old kid who sat in the front row of the 2001 World Series between the Yankees and Arizona Diamondbacks, holding a sign that read: \u201cYankees Fan Today, Tomorrow, Forever.\u2019\u2019\n\nYet, when it came time to negotiate a professional contact and listen to the Yankee proposals, there was only silence.\n\n\u201cOur scouting was absolutely accurate,\u2019\u2019 Cashman says, \u201cbut the signability was completely wrong. He was going to college. They had no interest in even entertaining offers.\n\n\u201cThey come from money, so he didn\u2019t need the money, and the dad really wanted him to have the college experience. So, he had the best of both worlds.\u2019\u2019\n\nSays Cole: \u201cMy Dad and I put an evaluation of what a UCLA education was valued at, how that compared to where I got drafted, and what the signing bonus would be. It was just too large of a discrepancy.\n\n\u201cThey were really understanding, but at that point, they had just signed A.J. [Burnett] and CC [Sabathia]. They were gearing up for the World Series. So they had bigger fish to fry.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Yankees never had a chance to re-draft him three years later. The Pirates had the first overall pick. They spent $8 million to make sure he didn\u2019t get away.\n\nA decade after drafting him the first time, the Yankees thought they had another chance to finally land him, making a series of strong trade proposals to the Pirates. On Jan. 13, 2018, Pittsburgh sent him to Houston and not New York, receiving a package of Joe Musgrove, Michael Feliz, Colin Moran and Jason Martin.\n\nThe Yankees were spurned again.\n\n\u201cBeauty is in the eye of the beholder,\u2019\u2019 Cashman said, \u201cso obviously Pittsburgh felt their best deal was with the Astros.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cSome things are not meant to be.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe went 20-5 with a league-leading 2.50 ERA during the regular season, and although the Tampa Bay Rays thought he might regress to the mean, he actually took his game to a different level in the AL Division Series. He faced 54 batters, struck out 25 of them, and permitted only six hits and a walk.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s like the kid still pitching in Little League that was a little too good for the league, you know?\u201d said Yankees manager Aaron Boone, wanting to check his birth certificate. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously a great pitcher in the prime of his career. And he\u2019s in a really good stretch right now.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe\u2019s not just dominating teams, but embarrassing them, striking out 351 batters in 228 innings in the regular season and postseason, generating 676 swings-and-misses this season. It\u2019s the most strikeouts by a right-handed pitcher since Nolan Ryan in 1974.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy what he\u2019s doing right now,\u2019\u2019 said former Cy Young and MVP winner Justin Verlander. \u201cHe just keeps getting better and better.\u2019\u2019\n\nVerlander and Cole, who will almost certainly finish 1-2 in the Cy Young voting this season, got their families together for a celebration last week after clinching the Division Series. Cole had his mom and dad in town, aunt and uncle, friends, and a certain brother-in-law who has made him awfully envious over the years.\n\nCole\u2019s wife, Amy, is the sister of San Francisco Giants shortstop Brandon Crawford, who just so happens to have a couple of World Series rings in his jewelry box.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I want,\u2019\u2019 Cole says. \u201cI think about it all of the time.\"\n\nCole isn\u2019t sure who\u2019s coming to New York for his first playoff game at Yankee Stadium Tuesday, but with a day game, and the possibility of nasty shadows around home plate, he\u2019d sure love to see sunny skies.\n\n\u201cNew York. Cold weather,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u201cIt will feel very Octoberish. That\u2019s when you\u2019ve got to perform your best, in October.\n\n\"It\u2019s the biggest stage. And it\u2019s the most fun. I just wish it could be the postseason all of the time, but you have to work your ass off to get there.\"", "description": "Houston's dominant right-hander was the Yankees' first-round pick all the way back in 2008, but he chose to go to college instead of signing.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published P.M.
