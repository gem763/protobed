I found it really funny because his accent was so over the top.\n\nI was like, \u2018Good, keep Mel B and Scary Spice alive while I\u2019m in the States, thank you!\u2019\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nCelebrity Juice is very cheeky. Do you worry about what they\u2019ll ask you to do?\n\nI never say no unless it really makes me feel uncomfortable, and there are very few things that make me feel uncomfortable.\n\nYou don\u2019t rehearse and it takes, like, four or five hours to film.\n\nLiterally anything can happen.\n\n(Image: ITV / Talkback Thames)\n\nSo you aren\u2019t worried you might make a fool of yourself?\n\nNo, they know how to edit it well... to get the funny juicy bits but not reveal if your skirt rides up too high, or you are doing anything too exposing.\n\nAnd I always wear underwear!\n\nOr leggings if I\u2019m involved in a game.\n\nWhy do you think the show has lasted so long (11 years)?\n\nPeople need more laughter and less seriousness.\n\nWe\u2019ve all got responsibilities, we\u2019ve all got to get up and do humdrum stuff we wish we didn\u2019t have to.\n\nThe more we can laugh and take the mickey out of ourselves \u2013 and each other \u2013 the better we feel at the end of the day.\n\n(Image: ITV / Talkback Thames)\n\nYou\u2019ve been based in the US for a long time. Do you enjoy being back in England?\n\nYeah, when we did the last Spice Girls show back in July, I was thinking I\u2019d go back to LA where I\u2019ve lived for the past 15 years, but I\u2019ve ended up staying.\n\nMy kids were loving it in Leeds, where we are surrounded by sheep and countryside and all my aunties.\n\nWe have a really big family there. Then this came along...\n\nAny chance we might see the rest of the Spice Girls joining in the fun?\n\nEmma\u2019s been on the show before, and I think Mel C\u2019s been on.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if Geri or Victoria have.\n\nI was saying they should just get the four of us on it. Pay them a lot of money, so they\u2019d have to!\n\nNo, I think they\u2019d do it for a laugh.\n\nCelebrity Juice is on Thur 10pm ITV2", "description": "Mel B tells us how she'll spice up our lives on Keith Lemon's Celebrity Juice after stepping in as team captain for Paddy McGuinness", "authors": ["Jenny Rodger", "Image", "Getty", "Channel", "Itv", "Talkback Thames"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20269822.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Talkback-Thames.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
