Republican Gov. Eric Greitens, elected in November 2016 and sworn in Jan. 9, has said he\u2019ll sign it once it reaches his desk.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty confident this year,\u201d Greg Mourad, vice president of the National Right to Work Committee, told Watchdog.org. \u201cI do expect it to pass.\u201d\n\nIf that all comes to fruition, Missouri will become the 28th right-to-work state, after Kentucky enacted a similar measure earlier this month. Indiana, Michigan, West Virginia and Wisconsin have also passed right-to-work laws in the past five years.\n\nRight-to-work laws prevent workers from having to join a union or pay union dues as a condition of employment.\n\nIt\u2019s been a decade-long battle in Missouri, where the Republican majority in the legislature debated the issue but never had the votes required to override the veto of Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon.\n\nThe Missouri Legislature finally passed a bill in 2015, but Nixon vetoed it. First elected in 2008 and re-elected in 2012, Nixon was term limited out of office.\n\nFormer House Speaker Tim Jones, now the head of conservative nonprofit Missouri Club for Growth, told Washington Examiner that \u201cleadership is of the thinking that the faster, the better. Everyone has already taken a position on this and we haven\u2019t had enough turnover in the legislature to think it will be any different this time.\u201d\n\nNow that Republicans have control of the governor\u2019s office, it seems to be only a matter of time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing for the people of Missouri,\u201d Mourad said. \u201cCertainly, it\u2019s going to spur economic development in the state.\u201d\n\nOf the eight states that border Missouri, only Illinois lacks a right-to-work law. Studies have shown that states that don\u2019t have forced unionism tend to attract more business and industry \u2014 and keep the ones they\u2019ve already got. For example, the Heritage Foundation found that unionized firms were 10 percentage points more likely to go out of businesses within seven years than those that weren\u2019t unionized.\n\nNational Economic Research Associates reported in 2015 that right-to-work laws can have a major impact on business location decisions, especially in heavily unionized industries such as manufacturing.\n\n\u201cOther things being equal, businesses are more likely to locate in states with RTW laws,\u201d author Jeffrey Eisenach wrote.\n\nNew Hampshire is also on track to pass right-to-work legislation in 2017. That state\u2019s Senate passed the bill 12-11 on Thursday and it\u2019s expected to be taken up in the House in the next few weeks, Mourad said.\n\nNew Hampshire would be the first state in the Northeast to enact a right-to-work law, and like Missouri it has a Republican governor who\u2019s already said he plans to add his John Hancock when the document is ready.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re optimistic about it passing in the House as well, and Gov. [Chris] Sununu has said he will sign it,\u201d Mourad said.", "description": "The Show Me State looks poised to show right-to-work advocates .09/02/2019 3:19:50AM EST.", "authors": ["Johnny Kampis", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2012/12/Greg-Mourad.jpg"}
