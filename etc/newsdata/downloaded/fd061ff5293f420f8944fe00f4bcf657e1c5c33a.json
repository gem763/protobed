At the time, he believed his first car would be, as he put it, \"water-powered.\"\n\nThat didn't happen, and he ended up buying \u2014 and fixing \u2014 a series of gas-powered cars. \"They were always, constantly, breaking down, these combustion vehicles,\" Singh said.\n\nAt some point, he asked himself: Why don't I go electric? This was 2010, and the Tesla Roadster was available. But it was priced at around $100,000 and was out of Singh's reach. He said other available electric vehicle (EV) options \"were not desirable.\"\n\nThat's when the Toronto-based entrepreneur said he started \"scheming\" on a plan: converting a gas guzzler into an electric vehicle. Singh went from studying cell biology and working in the pharmaceutical industry to learning everything there was about the design and engineering of e-cars .\n\nIn 2012, he successfully retrofitted his 1985 Jaguar XJ6. Singh now runs Epic Car Conversions, which specializes in converting internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles into 100 per cent EVs. The company has retrofitted about 40 vehicles, mostly high-end vintage cars, including Porsches and other Jaguars.\n\nEpic removes all the combustion components of the vehicle, from the engine to the fuel tank to the exhaust, and custom builds an electric drive unit specific to the car being retrofitted. It includes assembling a motor, inverter, battery pack and charger. It's a simplified unit that requires very little maintenance, said Singh. \"You will not have to see your mechanic ever for oil changes, spark plugs or tune-ups.\"\n\nSingh has a team of about 10 people, including mechanics and machinists, and the retrofitting process can take about two months \u2014 depending on the amount of customization involved, it can take longer.\n\nBecause each retrofit must be custom-built \"from scratch,\" the switch isn't cheap. Singh said prices range from about $25,000 for a battery with a 100-kilometre range (good for city driving) to $45,000 for a 250-km battery. He said some builds can be more than $85,000, but those are rare and typically include more range and customized paint jobs.\n\nThe high cost poses a challenge, said Singh, because his company is competing with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) like Tesla, Nissan and Ford \u2014 companies that buy and build EVs in bulk. He said Epic's advantage is its ability to customize any car.\n\nAnd it's looking to branch out. With help from the Canadian government, Singh's startup has made connections in places like Thailand and India, where Singh has been promoting Epic's electric-drive unit for use in vehicle fleets (like company cars or buses). He's also had conversations with a municipality in the Greater Toronto Area.\n\nKeeping maintenance and fuel costs low is the reason Singh started on this journey. But helping cut carbon emissions is also important for this father of one.\n\n\"If we have more electric vehicles on the road \u2026 we'll have cleaner air for the next generation.\"\n\n\u2014 Nazima Walji\n\nReader feedback\n\nLast Friday, an estimated seven million people came out worldwide to demonstrate for climate action, led by Swedish teen Greta Thunberg, who joined 500,000 protesters in Montreal. Do you think the ongoing climate strikes will have an impact on the Canadian election?\n\nEmail us at whatonearth@cbc.ca.\n\nOld issues of What on Earth? are right here .\n\nThe Big Picture: The cheapest forms of energy, by country\n\nTrees are key to fighting climate change, but industrial development and urbanization over the last couple of centuries have reduced the size of forests in parts of the world . Many countries have recognized the problem and have acted accordingly \u2014 China and India, for example, have undertaken aggressive tree-planting campaigns. The graph below captures the countries with the most tree cover \u2014 i.e. the percentage of their landmass covered by trees. Suriname, a country of about 550,000 people in South America, comes out on top. We also included some more populated countries underneath as a point of comparison.\n\n(CBC)\n\nHot and bothered: Provocative ideas from around the web\n\nThe British Isles get a lot of wind, and they've used that natural endowment to produce a lot of renewable energy. Now, General Electric is installing the world's largest turbines (260 metres tall) in an area off the Yorkshire coast called Dogger Bank, soon to be the world's largest wind farm .\n\nA Guardian article explores the idea of \"secret sustainability\" \u2014 namely, companies that have managed to make their manufacturing processes more energy- or resource-efficient, and thus better for the planet, but haven't gone public about it.\n\n'We're looking for common ground': Canadian scientist and 'Champion of the Earth' on talking to climate skeptics\n\n(Ashley Rodgers/Texas Tech University)\n\nKatharine Hayhoe is a Canadian climate scientist with a big voice. A professor at Texas Tech University's department of political science and director of the university's Climate Center, Hayhoe has been fervent in communicating the challenges and reality of climate change, as well as the solutions to limiting global warming to 2 C above the pre-industrial average.\n\nHayhoe's work recently earned her the United Nations 2019 Champions of the Earth award . Nicole Mortillaro spoke to her about the challenges of communicating the realities of climate change.\n\nWhat are the biggest hurdles for you in getting the message out about climate change?\n\nThere is a massively funded and very intelligent disinformation campaign that is trying to muddy the waters on everything that we do. So it is really kind of like the Girl Guides trying to fight the Marines here.\n\nWhen we first started, we [were] naive. We thought, well, surely the truth will win if we just tell people the truth. But it's such a highly politically polarized topic. And sadly, it isn't just limited to the U.S. anymore. In Canada, it's becoming increasingly politically polarized as well.\n\nWhy do you think it's become politicized?\n\nIt's become politicized because, if you go to Wikipedia and you just run your eyes down the list of the richest corporations in the world , No. 1 is Walmart. After Walmart, you have petroleum, petroleum, petroleum, energy, energy, petroleum, petroleum, energy, petroleum. So, we are talking about solutions that are overall beneficial for almost everybody on this planet, with one exception. And the one exception are the industries that currently hold the balance of power and wealth in this world.\n\nCan you change people's minds with facts?\n\nFacts are not what change people's minds because people have made the rejection of climate change part of their personal identity. And so changing their mind about climate change would require them to change their idea of who they are\u2026\n\nPeople don't truly have a problem with basic science, because if they did, they would also be rejecting stoves and fridges and airplanes. What they have a problem with is not the actual science. They have a problem with the perceived solution. We see the solution to be liberal, to be socialist, to be \u2014 as [former prime minister Stephen] Harper famously put it \u2014 the economy versus the environment. We see the only solutions to be harmful and punitive and potentially even worse than the impact, especially in Canada, where many people feel, \"Isn't warmer better?\"\n\nBut the reality is, there are many solutions that are extremely beneficial, that help us improve air quality, reduce our water use, grow the economy, grow local jobs.\n\nWhat bothers you the most about climate change science communication?\n\nIf we want to have constructive, positive conversations that move the dialogue along, we have to begin that conversation with what we most agree with, with that person, or those people or that organization, rather than what we disagree with her about. Not the Bill Nye approach , but rather the approach where we're looking for common ground.\n\nThose of us who are doing it, it is not part of our job description. It is not part of our daily routine, it is something that we're doing \u2026 above and beyond what we're actually doing in terms of our teaching and our research and our service. And it is a woefully, woefully under-supported and underfunded initiative.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nStay in touch!\n\nAre there issues you'd like us to cover?
