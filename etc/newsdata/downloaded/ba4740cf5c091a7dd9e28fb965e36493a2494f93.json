By incorporating prevention reminders into platforms people are accessing every day, we\u2019re giving people the tools they need to be proactive about their heart health,\u201d said Dr. Richard Kovacs, the president of the American College of Cardiology, in a statement.\n\nUsers who want to access Facebook\u2019s Preventive Health tools can search in the company\u2019s mobile app to find which checkups are recommended by the company\u2019s partner organizations based on the age and gender of a user.\n\nThe tool allows Facebookers to mark when the tests are completed, set reminders to schedule future tests and tell people in their social network about the tool.\n\nFacebook will even direct users to resources on where to have the tests. One thing that the company will not do, Facebook assures potential users, is collect the results of any test.\n\n\u201cHealth is particularly personal, so we took privacy and safety into account from the beginning. For example, Preventive Health allows you to set reminders for your future checkups and mark them as done, but it doesn\u2019t provide us, or the health organizations we\u2019re working with, access to your actual test results,\u201d the company wrote in a statement. \u201cPersonal information about your activity in Preventive Health is not shared with third parties, such as health organizations or insurance companies, so it can\u2019t be used for purposes like insurance eligibility.\u201d\n\nThe company said that people can also use the new health tool to find locations that administer flu shots.\n\n\u201cFlu vaccines can have wide-ranging benefits beyond just preventing the disease, such as reducing the risk of hospitalization, preventing serious medical events for some people with chronic diseases, and protecting women during and after pregnancy,\u201d said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, Director, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, CDC, in a statement. \u201cNew tools like this will empower users with instant access to information and resources they need to become a flu fighter in their own communities.\u201d", "description": "Nearly a year and a half after the Cambridge Analytica scandal reportedly scuttled Facebook\u2019s fledgling attempts to enter the healthcare market, the social media giant is launching a tool called \u201cPreventive Health\u201d to prompt its users to get regular checkups and connect them to service providers.
