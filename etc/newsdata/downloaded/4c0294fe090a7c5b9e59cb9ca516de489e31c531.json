(AP) - Following a complaint filed last year, Hermiston Dr. Bruce Carlson will no longer be able to treat patients with opioids for chronic pain unless they suffer from terminal illnesses.\n\nThe East Oregonian reports Carlson was placed on probation by the Oregon Medical Board in July after a complaint that alleged he prescribed controlled substances without medical purpose or without following proper procedures.\n\nCarlson said he is complying with the stipulated order, which includes a $5,000 penalty, a five-year probation period and compliance to an educational plan.\n\nIf Carlson completes the probationary period successfully, his license will not be revoked.\n\nAccording to the Oregon Medical Board, Carlson allowed a physician assistant to continue issuing prescriptions for Schedule II narcotics even though she failed her national recertification test.\n\nCarlson says he believed the assistant could still prescribe Vicodin, which had been listed as Schedule III, but was later reclassified as a Schedule II drug.\n\nThe complaint also lists several incidents in which Carlson reportedly prescribed excessive amounts of opioids to patients without medical justification. Carlson disagrees with the board\u2019s findings that he prescribed without justification.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: East Oregonian, http://www.eastoregonian.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Following a complaint filed last year, Hermiston Dr. Bruce Carlson will no longer be able to treat patients with opioids for chronic pain unless they suffer from terminal illnesses.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": ""}
