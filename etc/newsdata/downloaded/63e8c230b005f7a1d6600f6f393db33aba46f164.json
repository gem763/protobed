This Olympic ski racer did.", "language": "en", "text": "Advertisement\n\nWhat would you do for your children?\n\nPerhaps fund them through university or buy them a second-hand car when they pass their driving test.\n\nBut how about moving house to support their careers? And not just leaving an average property, but a spacious, detached five-bedroom family home - and moving into a rented one-bedroom flat.\n\nThat's what four-time Olympic ski racer Emma Carrick-Anderson and her husband former English ski champion Phil Smith did for their three children Luca, Freddy and Zak.\n\nSeveral years on and the decision has paid dividends as the Carrick-Smith brothers have already been crowned British ski champions and they are working towards the Winter Olympics.\n\nThe family moved to France and lived in this five-bedroom family home in Bozel - which they bought - before swapping it for a one-bed rented flat to be closer to the ski slopes in Tignes\n\nThe family rented out their five-bed house and rented a one-bed flat in this Tignes block in a trial run to be closer to the ski slopes to help the children's skiing careers\n\nThe Carrick-Smith brothers - pictured from left: Zak, Luca and Freddy - have their sights on the Winter Olympics\n\nLuca, 13, was born in Britain, while his 12-year-old twin brothers Zak and Freddy were born in France, with the family moving permanently from Britain to the French Alps a decade ago.\n\nParents Emma and Phil decided to base themselves in the French Alps to run their ski-coaching business Snoworks, which was set-up in 2000, and ensure that the children had access to the ski slopes.\n\nThe couple bought a luxury five-bedroom family home in Bozel, near the French ski resort of Courchevel, and described it as 'their dream home'. But it soon became apparent that it wasn't working and that they needed to be living literally on the slopes if they were going to give their children the best shot at a successful skiing career.\n\nThe boys added to their collection of trophies at this month's British Championships in Tignes, in the French Alps\n\n'It was too difficult to fit in running the business, taking the children to school in Courchevel, and getting them some time skiing, so we needed to move closer to the slopes,' explained Phil.\n\n'It allowed us to work, and earn the money needed to support the children. Skiing isn't a cheap sport and at this level can cost \u00a320,000 net a year to support each child.'\n\nHaving reached the top of their sport in their age group, the children are already attracting sponsorship, with SkyScanner the latest company to help fund all three boys.\n\nA skiing family: The Carrick-Smiths boys can regularly been seen on the slopes with their parents\n\nMum Emma Carrick-Anderson is a four-time Olympic ski racer, while Dad Phil Smith is a former English ski champion\n\nPictured: Son Luca as he competes in the British Championships\n\nBoth the parents and children have already invested a huge amount of time and energy to get this far.\n\nPhil said: 'At that time [living in the house in Bozel], the children were on the slopes every weekend and one day a week, because they only had school four days a week.'\n\nBut it wasn't enough time on the slopes, so the family rented out the Bozel house as a trial run, and rented a one-bedroom flat in Tignes.\n\nThe children slept in the bedroom, while Phil and Emma slept in the living room.\n\nWith no separate office area in the flat, Phil resorted to the bathroom when he needed to work early in the morning and avoid waking Emma. It meant he could often be found sitting on the toilet with a laptop on his knee.\n\nEmma explained: 'If you had received an email from Phil around that time, it had probably been sent from him sitting on the toilet.'\n\nThe boys regularly win ski races and now need extra shelves at home to house their trophies\n\nA tiny space: Phil points out the rear of the block of flats in Tignes where the entire family once rented a one-bed flat\n\nThe one-bed flat that the family of five rented is in the centre of the ski resort of Tignes and has easy access to the slopes\n\nAll three children are now home-schooled, but previously went to school in the ski resort of Tignes\n\nThe Carrick-Smith boys were given easy access to the ski slopes while they were young\n\nThe family managed a year in that one-bedroom apartment before moving.\n\nThey started to look for a place to buy in Tignes, seeking a ground floor flat as the boys were still young and needed easy access to the outdoors.\n\nThey found a three-bedroom flat within their budget that was on the slopes, so they could ski straight out of the front door. But it needed to be renovated. So they sold their house in Bozel and with the same money bought the Tignes flat and renovated it.\n\nEmma said: 'We swapped our dream family home for a flat, but that shows how expensive it is in resort.\n\n'We could walk the children out of the Tignes flat to school, and then walk on to meet our clients. And the children could access the slopes straight from the flat. It meant they could get extra few runs on the slopes if they had a few moments, and is it that extra training time that really counts.'\n\nEmma and Phil described the five-bed house in Bozel, France, as their dream home, but sold it to help their children's careers\n\nA head start! All three boys have skied from an early age and now compete regularly\n\nThe spacious home they all once lived in had plenty of space for all five members of the family\n\nThe five-bed family home had a separate dining area where the family could all sit and eat\n\nThe light and bright space at the five-bed family house also had a large balcony with an outdoor eating area\n\nFast forward almost a decade and the easy access to the slopes has paid off as Luca, and twins Freddy and Zak have all been British champions.\n\nDad Phil is keen to address any accusations of being a pushy parent, saying: 'They've been British champions, and if they continue, that's great. And if they want to change their careers, that is also fine with Emma and I.\n\n'Emma and I are ski coaches and we run a ski business, that's our skill set. At the moment the three children all want skiing to be their career and we can help them.\n\n'I don't think we are those parents who live through their children's lives, we want a balance. We don't want to jeopardize everything. It is a fine line.'\n\nBut by the same token, he said he didn't want the children to get to 16 and not be in a position to enter the Winter Olympics if that is what they wanted to do.\n\nPerfecting their ski skills! Being on snow is second nature for the three Carrick-Smith boys\n\nThe family sold their five-bed house and bought this three-bed house in Tignes after renting for a year in the ski resort to test the water\n\nHaving since moved out of the three-bedroom flat in Tignes, Phil Smith revisited it this month with MailOnline Property\n\nThe children are all now home schooled to help with their skiing, and have been for the past two years. It means they can live in a larger family home out of the resort while having the time to dedicate to training in all across the French Alps.\n\nEmma said: 'We can access all the resorts and have space at home for the children.'\n\nAll three children spend a minimum of three or four hours a day on the slopes, meaning at least 16 hours a week on skis.\n\nPhil founded the ski courses company Snoworks, which helps to fund the children's careers (Pictured: Snoworks instructor Jenny Yates)\n\nLuca stands on the podium at the British Championships in Tignes this month\n\nTwins Freddy (left) and Zak (right) have also been winning trophies since they were young\n\nSo would they recommend moving home to support your children's careers and would they do it all over again?\n\nIt's a definitive 'yes' from Phil, who says the family would even move to another country to help the children in the future.\n\nAnd Emma agrees, saying: 'If there was a time when we felt that the training facilities or opportunities were better elsewhere, we would move again.'\n\nAs for the children, they remained focused on being the best they can be at skiing.\n\nAnd if they win the Olympics and become World Champions, what type of property would each of the boys like to buy?\n\nLuca says he will buy a wooden shack near the sea so he can surf, while Zak says he would like a home near the cliffs. As for Freddy, he isn't quite sure, but instead - rather generously - says he will buy his parent's dream home for them.\n\nIt means that with the Olympics surely in sight for the Carrick-Smith boys, their parents could be soon living once again in their dream home.\n\nIf you want to get the family out skiing, try Mark Warner holidays, prices from \u00a3709* for a family holiday to Tignes.", "description": "Four-time Olympic ski racer Emma Carrick-Anderson and her husband former English ski champion Phil Smith supported their children's careers by moving house.", "authors": ["Myra Butterworth For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/04/16/14/12343710-0-image-a-55_1555420432873.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-20"}
