And Trump has made no secret of his ire over the weakness of other currencies relative to the dollar. Trump even got into a scrap earlier this year with European Central Bank President Mario Draghi over the weakness of the euro EURUSD, -0.0455%, while often referring to the dollar\u2019s strength when bashing the Federal Reserve and his handpicked chairman, Jerome Powell, for not cutting rates more aggressively.\n\nBut \u201cdeep challenges\u201d facing policy makers in Europe and Asia \u201cnow mean that it will be Washington\u2019s job to get the dollar weaker \u2014 either through trade conciliation or the Fed shifting to a full-on easing cycle,\u201d Turner said. \u201cNeither of those outcomes look immediate, meaning that the risk environment could well deteriorate into year-end.\u201d\n\nThat would also be good news for the Japanese yen, he said, a traditional haven.\n\nAs for the euro, its likely to languish in the $1.05 - $1.10 range versus the dollar into year-end as Europe\u2019s slowdown broadens from the manufacturing sector into services and the ECB resumes its bond purchases. Meanwhile, the prospect of a further extension the U.K.\u2019s current Oct. 31 deadline for leaving the European Union could weaken the British pound GBPUSD, -0.3000% by another 5%, Turner said.\n\nThe ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.18%, a non-trade-weighted measure of the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, has given back some ground this month, pulling back around 0.6% so far in October. But it remains up 2.7% for the year to date and around 3.3% over the last 12 months after hitting a more-than-two-year high on Oct. 1.\n\nStocks continue to trade within hailing distance of all-time highs, with the S&P 500 SPX, -0.28% rising nearly 18% so far this year and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.20%, up 14%. That marks a rebound, however, from a steep fourth-quarter selloff last year. Over the longer run, stocks have moved relatively sideways.", "description": "Investors and traders looking for the U.S. dollar\u2019s strength to break might be cooling their heels for a while.", "authors": ["William Watts", "Deputy Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS789_dollar_ZG_20191007115157.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
