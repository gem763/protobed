USA TODAY\n\nEnes Kanter says he and teammate Tacko Fall were surrounded by several men he believed to be supporters of Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan outside of a Boston mosque on Friday.\n\nThe pair of Boston Celtics teammates attended a Friday afternoon prayer session between preseason practices. When they exited the the Islamic Society of Boston mosque in Cambridge, they were confronted by a group of people.\n\n\"There's Turkish people, pro-Erdogan people, that are actually attacking us right here,\" Kanter said in a video posted to Twitter. \"I told you, America, this is crazy right.\"\n\nKanter, a native of Turkey, pointed out two men in the video he believed were Erdogan supporters, one of whom was simultaneously filming Kanter. Fall is from Senegal.\n\n\"Pro-Erdogan guy started a fight outside of the mosque,\" he told a bystander toward the end of the video, which ends when the duo enter their ride back to the Celtics' facility. \"This is what they do.\"\n\nHello Everyone!#DictatorErdogan@RTErdogan thugs attacked and threatened me today after Friday prayer in Boston at a mosque\n\n\n\nTurkish Government don't even let me practice my religion freely in America let alone my freedom of speech is under attack@FBI@FBIBoston@bostonpolicepic.twitter.com/FH2Ixe6QcY \u2014 Enes Kanter (@EnesKanter) October 4, 2019\n\nOn Saturday, Kanter told reporters this was the first time an incident like that occurred in the United States. He also emphasized that he did not blame Americans for what happened and placed all of the blame on the Turkish government.\n\n\"But it was just sad because right next to me there was a rookie and it was Tacko,\" he said, according to ESPN. \"He felt very uncomfortable so I was like 'This is weird, we have get out of this situation.'\"\n\nKanter said he has been in contact with the FBI and local politicians, including Boston mayor Marty Walsh.\n\n\"I was just scared,\" Kanter said. \"How about if they do something? I mean, more than me, it's Tacko ... I (wanted) to protect my Tacko.\n\n\"But it's not about Boston. It's about Turkish people. I would never, ever blame Boston or people in Boston. I would definitely blame the Turkish people and the Turkish government.\"\n\nKanter has long been a political opponent of Erdogan. In 2016, the 27-year-old supported a failed coup attempt by Fetullah G\u00fclen. That prompted his family to disown him, and Turkish authorities placed a warrant out for his arrest.\n\nLast season, while with the New York Knicks, he did not travel to London for a game out of fear for his life. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, wanted to ensure safe passage to Toronto last year when he was traded to the Portland Trailblazers. And this summer, he cancelled a free basketball camp for kids due to a threat he received.\n\nOther notable Turkish basketball players, such as Hedo Turkoglu, claim Kanter has engaged in a smear campaign against Erdogan.\n\nKanter said he'll continue fighting against the regime in Turkey.\n\n\"So, just because I'm talking about these issues and that stuff, I'm going to get threats?\" he said. \"(Then) I'll take that. I'll be OK having security next to me 24/7. But those issues that I'm talking about are way bigger than myself and basketball.\"\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "description": "Boston Celtics center Enes Kanter and Tacko Fall say after leaving a Cambridge area mosque on Friday, they were confronted by several men.", "authors": ["Chris Bumbaca", "Published P.M.
