She told me that if you go out and try to find death, you lose. Death will never leave you then.\u201d\n\nSuon has previously won acclaim for \u201cThe Storm Makers\u201d, his look at the issue of human trafficking in Cambodia.\n\nHe previously worked under the mentorship of Oscar-nominated director Rithy Panh (\u201cThe Missing Picture\u201d), also a survivor of the Khmer Rouge and the driving force behind the country\u2019s Bophana film archive, while he champions the cause of young Cambodian filmmakers\n\nMany of them have been exploring similar themes to those traced by Suon, including this year\u2019s Oscar hope from Cambodia, director Caylee So\u2019s \u201cIn the Life of Music\u201d, which traces a romance that is haunted by the Khmer Rouge reign of terror.\n\nSo -\u2013 whose family fled the country when she was an infant -\u2013 believes a current crop of emerging Cambodian filmmakers are collectively finding \u201cnew landscapes\u201d when it comes to dealing with their homeland\u2019s recent and tragic past.\n\n\u201cIt such a big part of our lives and our history,\u201d said So. \u201cWe are finding that through film we can in some ways start to address some things that none of us can escape.\u201d", "description": "Busan (South Korea) (AFP) \u2013 French-Cambodian filmmaker Guillaume Suon grew up haunted by the ghosts of his mother\u2019s past.
