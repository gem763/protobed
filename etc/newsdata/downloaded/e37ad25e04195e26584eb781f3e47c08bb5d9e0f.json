Someone made and sold a faulty fridge-freezer, which created the first sparks.\n\nSomeone installed cladding which did not meet building regulations. Someone did not check whether it met building regulations. Someone decided that it did.\n\nMore than one person, in more than one organisation, ignored years of repeated warnings from firefighters, fire chiefs, and fire experts that such cladding was lethal.\n\nSomeone ordered a refurbishment of Grenfell Tower that destroyed its ability to contain a fire. There were missing fire doors and gaps in the walls that allowed smoke to fill the single staircase, cutting off the only route of escape.\n\nSomeone did not bother to ask the fire brigade to check the refurbishment was safe.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nThe Grenfell Tower inquiry findings being reported today are about what happened on the night of the fire, on June 14, 2017.\n\nIt found the fire brigade command was confused and erratic. That juniors stuck to rules about telling people to \"stay put\" for an hour after they should have been evacuated. That while its firefighters were selfless heroes who repeatedly ran into an inferno with little hope of finding anyone alive, its training, resources and instructions were woeful.\n\nAs the Fire Brigades Union has said, there is no evidence that 30 firefighters could have evacuated 150 people down a single, smoke-logged, stairwell. And as one relative pointed out, the fire went out only when there was nothing left to burn.\n\nBut Dany Cotton said something else, which only the shockingly callous would ignore: \"No building had ever behaved like that. No building ever should.\"\n\n(Image: Evening Standard / eyevine)\n\nWhen the first 999 calls said the fire was burning DOWN the building, the emergency operators didn't think it was possible.\n\nWhen firefighters arrived, they couldn't believe their eyes. Their hoses didn't reach even halfway up, and burning plastic rained down upon them, and thousands of eyewitnesses.\n\nHundreds of adults and children watched their loved ones burn. They lost their lives, too, with the added burden of having to live with it.\n\nAn emergency service that makes emergencies worse when it turns up is no use to anyone.\n\nBut the fire brigade should never have been called. That tower should never have burned in the first place.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nIt should have had fire doors and sprinklers. The refurbishment should have added a second fire escape. The cladding should have been banned.\n\nThe coroner who ruled the deaths of 6 people in the Lakanal House fire 8 years earlier were due to cladding and the \"stay put\" policy should have been listened to. Fire chiefs who realised a 2016 blaze in Shepherds Bush spread via the cladding, and who wrote to every council in London warning them, should have been heeded.\n\nThe British Standards Institute's seventh annual fire conference in 2014, at which the government fire safety adviser was present, should have paid attention when it heard evidence that gaps between the cladding and the walls created a wind tunnel, and that a tragedy was inevitable.\n\nEvery council housing officer, every building regs inspector, every contractor and politician should have noticed dozens of cladding fires on towers worldwide, and acted to ensure it did not happen here.\n\nThe Grenfell residents who raised concerns should have been heard, before they burned.\n\nInstead, laws stipulating all external walls in the capital should have an hour of fire resistance were scrapped in 1986.\n\nInstead, communities secretary Eric Pickles ordered a review of building regulations in 2013 that didn't happen. In 2014, housing minister Brandon Lewis refused to make sprinklers mandatory, saying: \"The cost of fitting a fire sprinkler system may affect house building \u2013 something we want to encourage.\"\n\nInstead, the Mayor of London axed \u00a365million, 10 fire stations, 14 fire engines and 552 firefighters from his fire service. When a consultation found 94% of those asked were against the cuts, he ignored it. He over-ruled opposition on the London Assembly, and when asked how he could possibly still call this reduction in fire cover an \"improvement\" he told his questioner to \"get stuffed\".\n\nThat Mayor is now Prime Minister. And flammable cladding is still on more than 2,000 tower blocks, hospitals, schools and homes, nationwide.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nThere are 60,000 people still living in torches created by cuts and callousness that emanated from those in ivory towers, who show little care for those who live in concrete ones.\n\nFire service funding across England was cut by 30% between 2010 and 2015, and it has been slashed again this year.\n\nTwo years after Grenfell, the \"stay put\" policy is staying put. It has not been reviewed. The advice today, in another cladding fire, would still be to stay in your flat and pray you don't burn.\n\nNo-one has been prosecuted. Those \"someones\" have not been identified. The rules have been tweaked but not changed, new cladding is banned but old stuff is not, and firefighter jobs are still being snuffed out as though what they do is of no import.\n\nSome survivors are still homeless. All are still suffering.\n\nTheresa May avoided Grenfell survivors for as long as she could before ordering an inquiry thoughtfully split into two parts, so that it would roast the firefighters first. Phase 2, about who is responsible for the blaze, will not begin until next year.\n\nA police investigation, manned by 170 officers, is ongoing while those leading it say there is \"no guarantee\" anyone will ever be charged.\n\nHad it been a tower of million-pound penthouses that burned, you can bet your house someone would be serving time for it by now.\n\nBut as far as the government, the authorities, the criminal justice system, and the Prime Minister are concerned, there is no reason to do anything they have done differently.\n\nAnd that is shockingly callous.", "description": "Those in ivory towers have shown no care for those in concrete ones", "authors": ["Fleet Street Fox", "Image", "Swns", "Evening Standard", "Eyevine", "Pa", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20756826.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_SOCIAL-FSF-Boris-Johnson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
