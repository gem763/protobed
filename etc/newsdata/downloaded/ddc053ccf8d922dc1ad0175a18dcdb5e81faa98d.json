Length: 44 feet Weight: 7.5 tons Height: 9ft 2in Speed: The car will attempt to beat the 763mph land speed record next year. It is hoped it could one day reach 1,000mph Engine: Rolls-Royce EJ200 engine used in Eurofighter Typhoon jets Wheels: 95kg aluminium wheels rotating at 10,200rpm at full speed Temperature in the rocket: 5,432F (3000C)\n\n'There was strong crosswind gusting at over 15 mph and we've established that this is pretty much the limit for running in the car.\n\nWe're happy because this was a successful test, now we're ready to progress on to higher speeds.'\n\nA 10-mile desert racetrack has been set up in what organisers say is the 'largest area of land ever cleared by hand for a motorsport event'.\n\nFunded by South African authorities, local people have have moved some 16,239 tons of rock from 237million square feet of dry lakebed.\n\nBloodhound staff can lay out as many as 25 individual tracks side by side, as the car will break up the surface when it travels at extreme speeds.\n\nThe 7.5-ton car was dissembled and transported via air freight to South Africa to limit any knocks and bumps which may disturb its precise tuning - before being rebuilt in the desert.\n\nBloodhound staff can lay out as many as 25 individual tracks side by side, as the car will break up the surface when it travels at extreme speeds\n\nDuring the tests data will be collected by 192 pressure sensors measuring airflow on the car - as the car accelerates and after as wheel brakes, airbrakes and drag parachutes attempt to slow the car.\n\nThis will allowing analysis of how the car reacts under different forces and allow adjustments before the record attempt.\n\nTest runs described as 'low-speed' tests - which nonetheless reached 200mph - were previously carried out in Cornwall in 2017.\n\nFor the record attempt the Bloodhound will also be fitted with a monopropellant rocket as well as the jet engine.\n\nThe 7.5-ton car was dissembled and transported via air freight to South Africa to limit any knocks and bumps which may disturb its precise tuning - it was then re-built in the desert\n\nUnveiling: The British-built Bloodhound car, powered by the engine of a Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jet, displayed in the Hakskeenpan desert\n\nBloodhound LSR engineering director Mark Chapman told Motorsports Magazine: 'Transforming Bloodhound from a runway spec car to one capable of reaching speeds in the transonic range on the desert racetrack has been no small task.\n\n'The team of engineers, craftsmen, fabricators and technicians have pulled out all the stops to upgrade the car in just a few months since the rescue from administration last December.\n\n'After many years in preparation, we can't wait to get out to the Hakskeenpan and let Bloodhound off the leash to see just how it performs.'\n\nThe project suffered a setback last year when the company behind it went into administration.\n\nDesert testing: The car is hoped to reach speeds of up to 500mph as it prepares to take on the 763mph record set by former fighter pilot Andy Green in 1997\n\nThe jet-powered vehicle was flown to Johannesburg and then transported another 570 miles to the desert where tests will take place\n\nBut it was saved from the scrapheap when British entrepreneur Ian Warhurst bought the business in December 2018.\n\n'The wheels have been designed specifically for this desert lake bed, but it will still be vital to test them at high speeds before making record speed runs,' he explained earlier this year.\n\nRecord holder Mr Green said: 'After years of work to prepare the car, and following almost a decade of preparation of our desert track by the Northern Cape government, we're delighted to finally be here.\n\n'The next few weeks will allow us to test the car and train the team, ready for our assault on the outright world land speed record next year.'", "description": "Engineers of the jet engine powered car plan to pass the current record of 763mph set 22-years-ago by\u00a0RAF wing commander Andy Green (UK) in Black Rock Desert, Nevada with\u00a0Thrust SSC.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/12/20325028-0-image-a-39_1572353238679.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
