Instead, Republican lawmakers are supporting a huge, federally mandated boost to America\u2019s growing school surveillance industry.\n\nMillions of American students, across thousands of school districts, are already being monitored by tech companies that scan everything they write in school emails, chats and shared documents, looking for signs of suicidal thoughts or plans for a school shooting. This surveillance technology doesn\u2019t turn off when the school day is over: anything students type in official school accounts is monitored 24 hours a day, whether they are in their classrooms or their bedrooms.\n\nUnder digital surveillance: how American schools spy on millions of kids Read more\n\nThere is still no research evidence that demonstrates whether or not online monitoring of schoolchildren actually works to prevent violence.\n\nDespite this, new legislation introduced Wednesday by Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and longtime ally of the National Rifle Association (NRA), would update the Children\u2019s Internet Protection Act to mandate that public schools adopt \u201ca technology protection measure that detects online activities of minors who are at risk of committing self-harm or extreme violence against others\u201d.\n\nA spokesperson for Cornyn did not immediately respond to a request for comment on why he and other Senate Republicans are mandating that public schools adopt a new technology before there is any clear evidence that it\u2019s effective in preventing violence.\n\nThe Cornyn bill, entitled the Response Act, includes a range of other policies without strong evidence of reducing mass shootings, including expediting the federal death penalty for perpetrators of mass shootings, a priority of Donald Trump.\n\nPrivacy advocates say pervasive surveillance is not appropriate for an educational setting, and that it may actually harm children, particularly students with disabilities and students of color, who are already disproportionately targeted with school disciplinary measures.\n\n\u201cYou are forcing schools into a position where they would have to surveil by default,\u201d said Amelia Vance, the director of education privacy at the Future of Privacy Forum.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a privacy debate to be had about whether surveillance is the right tactic to take in schools, whether it inhibits students trust in their schools and their ability to learn,\u201d Vance said. But \u201cthe bottom line,\u201d she said, is \u201cwe do not have evidence that violence prediction works\u201d.\n\nThere\u2019s no hard data on how many public schools are already monitoring what students write 24 hours a day. But Vance estimates that only a third of US school districts, at most, currently use this technology.\n\nIf Cornyn\u2019s bill becomes law, \u201cyou\u2019re going to force probably 10,000 districts to buy a new product that they\u2019re going to have to implement\u201d, she said.\n\nThat would mean redirecting public schools\u2019 time and money away from strategies that are backed by evidence, such as supporting mental health and counseling services, and towards dealing with surveillance technologies, which often produce many false alarms, like alerts about essays on To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nFear of school shootings has already fueled rapid growth in the school surveillance industry, particularly after a school shooting in Parkland, Florida, last year left 17 people dead. Companies that sell this technology are marketing it to schools with bold claims of lives saved \u2013 numbers based only on internal, anecdotal estimates, not independent analysis.\n\nOne leading school surveillance company, Gaggle, says its technology is currently used to monitor 4.5 million students across 1,400 school districts. The company claims that in the last academic year alone its technology \u201chelped districts save the lives of more than 700 students who were planning or actually attempting suicide\u201d.\n\nSecurly, another company, says its products are used to protect 10 million students across 10,000 individual schools. In the past year, Securly said it helped school officials intervene in 400 situations that presented an \u201cimminent threat\u201d.\n\nAnother company, Bark says it works with at least 1,400 school districts across the country, and claims its technology has helped prevent \u201c16 credible school shootings\u201d and detected \u201ctwenty thousand severe self-harm situations\u201d. Bark, which sells a for-profit app to help parents monitor what their children are doing online, offers its surveillance technology to schools for free.\n\nFirst passed in 2000, the Children\u2019s Internet Protection Act was originally designed to make sure that American kids would not be looking at porn on taxpayer-funded school computers. It currently requires schools to monitor students\u2019 \u201conline activities\u201d, although privacy experts say that what that means \u2013 and what constitutional limits there may be on the monitoring \u2013 have never been clearly defined.", "description": "A new Senate bill would give a federally mandated boost to America\u2019s growing school surveillance industry", "authors": ["Lois Beckett"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1f460f78bcba3c1e078e9f583bb9125923c3ee8/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ffabba3d4bab1f09065334751ce11c4a", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
