This allows an organization to easily see their current score, how the metrics have tracked over time, and how they compare to peers. Dayforce Intelligence quantifies the value that can be created by incremental improvements and recommends where to focus to maximize value creation.\n\n\u201cDayforce Intelligence will enable HR leaders to understand the performance of their HR processes, benchmark relative to peer organizations, and lead their companies to best-in-class performance,\u201d said David Ossip, Chairman and CEO, Ceridian. \u201cThis is essential for HR to be strategic and to create hard dollar value for their organizations.\u201d\n\nDayforce Wallet\n\nDayforce Wallet helps workers feel a sense of empowerment over their earnings and regain control of their finances. Dayforce Wallet allows workers to access their already-earned wages anytime during the pay period.\n\nLeveraging Dayforce\u2019s continuous pay calculations, Dayforce Wallet processes a same-day payroll each time a worker requests their pay. The solution is compliant with federal, state, and local remittances and requires no changes to payroll processing including the funding, timing, and close-out of pay.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of Americans live paycheck-to-paycheck and struggle to bridge unexpected expenses. Instead they rely on high-interest debt, such as credit cards and pay day loans,\u201d continued Ossip. \u201cDayforce Wallet provides a better solution for financial wellness.\u201d\n\nDayforce Hub\n\nDayforce Hub provides a one stop shop for all things HCM. It allows customers to tailor the Dayforce experience with their branding and content through configurable widgets and styles.\n\n\u201cDayforce Hub drives engagement and alignment with organizational culture,\u201d said Andrew Shopsowitz, Product and Innovation Lead, Ceridian. \u201cIt provides an immersive experience to increase user adoption, enabling customers to maximize the value of their Dayforce solution.\u201d\n\nAvailability\n\nDayforce Intelligence, Dayforce Wallet, and Dayforce Hub are expected to be available in 2020.\n\nAbout Ceridian\n\nCeridian.
