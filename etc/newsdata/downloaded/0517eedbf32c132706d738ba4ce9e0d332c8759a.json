Photo: Tom Fox/AP\n\nAmber Guyger, the Dallas police officer who shot and killed her black neighbor inside his own apartment last September, has been found guilty of murder.\n\nOn September 6, 2018, Guyger entered the apartment of her 26-year-old neighbor, Botham Jean, and fatally shot him. Prosecutors say he was watching TV and eating ice cream when Guyger came through his doorway and opened fire; she has maintained that she thought she was in her own apartment and was acting in self-defense. At the time of the shooting, per the New York Times, she was off-duty but in uniform.\n\nGuyger \u2014 who was originally charged with manslaughter but later indicted for murder by a grand jury \u2014 spent her weeklong trial attempting to convince the courtroom that her response was reasonable. Prosecutors emphasized that Jean was \u201cnever a threat\u201d to her and called forth witnesses who testified that the bullet trajectory indicated he was either rising from a sitting position or \u201cin a cowering position\u201d when he was shot, according to the Times. On Tuesday, after jurors deliberated for less than two days, Judge Tammy Kemp announced that the jury had found her guilty of murder.\n\nThe verdict makes this a rare case in which a white police officer was convicted of murder for using lethal force on an unarmed black person \u2014 in the 2014 murder of Eric Garner, for instance, the officer who wrestled the defenseless black man to the ground and choked him to death was never even indicted. Upon hearing the verdict on Tuesday, Jean\u2019s family and the activists who have closely followed this case responded with relief.\n\n\u201cGod is good \u2014 trust him,\u201d Allison Jean, Botham\u2019s mother, said as she left the courtroom. Alongside her, Botham\u2019s grandmother walked out with her fist in the air.\n\nOutside the courtroom, Lee Merritt, an attorney for the Jean family, celebrated the verdict as a \u201chuge victory\u201d \u2014 not just for the Jean family but for \u201call black people in America.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a signal that the tide is going to change here,\u201d Merritt told reporters. \u201cPolice officers are going to be held accountable for their actions, and we believe this is going to change the policing culture all over the world.\u201d\n\nPer NBC News, Guyger will be sentenced later today, around 1 p.m. Dallas time. She faces a sentence of between five and 99 years.\n\nStay in touch.
