We want that uncertainty removed.\"\n\nThe helicopter that crashed was heavily damaged. (Transportation Safety Board of Canada)\n\nIt's recommending the federal Department of Transportation better define \"safety belt.\"\n\nFederal ministers have to respond to these recommendations within 30 days to explain what they have done or will do.\n\nNo securing standards\n\nSpecifically for Hydro One, investigators found there weren't standards for securing small pieces of gear such as tool bags to external platforms, known as Air Stairs, which serve as steps on and off the aircraft.\n\n\"The practice of carrying external loads attached to the platform, for flight to and from work sites, was not a formalized procedure at the company and, as a result, adequate controls were not in place to ensure that objects were properly stored or secured,\" it said.\n\nBefore the final report, Hydro One said the utility company carried out a number of changes following the crash, including an independent review.", "description": "The Transportation Safety Board of Canada says wants changes to federal standards for safety belts because of a helicopter crash that killed four people in 2017.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4454892.1513628349!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/tweed-helicopter-crash-scene.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
