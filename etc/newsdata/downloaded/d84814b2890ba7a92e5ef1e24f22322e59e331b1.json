Already, Mulvaney is under scrutiny for potentially abetting the blockage of $400 million in aid to Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, it appears that former tough-on-crime prosecutor Rudy Giuliani may be having a tough time staying off crime. Last week, ABC News reported that the president\u2019s personal lawyer is being investigated by the FBI\u2019s New York office and by Southern District of New York prosecutors for his dealings with his associates Lev \u201cMafia Rave\u201d Parnas and Igor \u201cFraud Guarantee\u201d Fruman. Responding to Hill\u2019s testimony claiming that he ran a shadow State operation in Ukraine, the president\u2019s lawyer responded: \u201cNothing shadowy about it.\u201d", "description": "In closed-door testimony on Monday before the Trump impeachment inquiry, former Trump adviser Fiona Hill relayed John Bolton\u2019s finer thoughts on the president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, including the fact he thought he was a \u201chand grenade.\u201d", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/14/john_bolton.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
