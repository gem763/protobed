Add Interest\n\nIn the first visit to Nepal by a Chinese president in 23 years, Xi said that \u201cthose who engage in separatist activities in any part of China will be smashed into pieces\u201d during a meeting with the Nepalese prime minister K.P. Sharma, according to the state-owned newspaper China Daily, adding that \u201cexternal support for separatists will be seen by the Chinese people as delusional.\u201d\n\nAlthough the comments were not made directly in connection with the Hong Kong protests, they followed a weekend of violence in which a bomb exploded and a police officer was stabbed during overnight clashes between protesters and police.\n\nAnthony Kwan/Getty Images\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner of Police, Tang-Ping-keung, warned that \u201cviolence against police has reached a life-threatening level\u201d in a press conference Monday.\n\nBut the protests continued with an event held in Central Hong Kong in support of the U.S. Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which is pending the approval of Congress. The act, which is believed to have broad bipartisan support, will require the State Department to report annually as to whether Hong Kong is sufficiently autonomous, and assess annually whether \u201cChina has eroded Hong Kong's civil liberties and rule of law.\u201d Hong Kong's special status under U.S. law would be contingent on these annual reports. Other provisions of the act would impose a visa ban on anyone found torturing protesters, and allow protesters to still be able to obtain visas for travel to the U.S. even if they have police records from nonviolent protesting.\n\nThere is also further legislation pending which could impose export restrictions of certain American products such as tear gas. Senator Rick Scott requested a meeting with the company NonLethal Technologies Inc, after a report by Reuters found that the company had supplied tear gas to Hong Kong police.\n\nA US company is providing tear gas used against pro-democracy fighters in #HongKong.\n\n\n\nThis week I requested a meeting with the leadership of NonLethal Technologies Inc. As a freedom-loving country we should be supporting freedom around the globe, not hindering it. https://t.co/Z3XaXdDdGP \u2014 Rick Scott (@SenRickScott) October 12, 2019\n\nThe Hong Kong government today expressed their regret over to proposed bill, saying that foreign legislatures should not interfere in Hong Kong's affairs.\n\n\"Since the return to the Motherland, the HKSAR has been exercising 'Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong' and a high degree of autonomy in strict accordance with the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China,\" a spokesperson for the government said in a statement. \"The 'one country, two systems' principle has been fully and successfully implemented. Human rights and freedoms in Hong Kong are fully protected by the Basic Law, the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance and other legislation. The HKSAR Government attaches great importance to them and is determined to safeguard them.\"\n\nUmit Bektas/Reuters\n\nFootage from the rally shows thousands of protesters, many waving American flags. One speaker asked the crowd \u201cDo we want the help of the U.S.?\u201d The response, an energetic \u201cYes!\u201d The protest Monday evening received a \u201cLetter of No Objection\u201d from the Hong Kong Police in the increasingly restless economic island hub.\n\nThe Republican Senator Josh Hawley spent Sunday evening watching the protestors in Hong Kong, and released a video on social media directly addressed to the protesters expressing solidarity with the movement.\n\n\u201cSometimes the fate of one city defines the challenge of a whole generation,\u201d he said. \u201c50 years ago it was Berlin, today it is Hong Kong ... The free people of the world are standing with you so that we can all say that we\u2019re Hong Kongers' now.\u201d\n\nMy message for the Hong Kong Human Rights & Democracy Act protest today pic.twitter.com/R90KeObggJ \u2014 Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) October 14, 2019 /> />\n\nSenator Ted Cruz was also been in Hong Kong over the weekend, but a scheduled meeting with the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong legislature Carrie Lam was cancelled at the last minute. Cruz criticized the NBA last week for apologizing to Chinese officials after the Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted in support of the Hong Kong protesters.\n\nThe protest movement began in early June in response to a proposed extradition bill that would have allowed suspected criminals in Hong Kong to be sent to mainland China for trial. Since then, thousands of protesters have taken to the streets every weekend.\n\nLam has since withdrawn the controversial bill, but widespread unrest has continued as demonstrators broadened their demands. Among their demands are a call for an independent inquiry into allegations of police brutality.\n\nABC News' Justin Solomon and Conor Finnegan contributed to this report.", "description": "President Xi Jinping vowed that Chinese separatists would be \u2018smashed to pieces\u2019 as US-themed protests began in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/hong-kong-usflag-rt-ps-191014_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
