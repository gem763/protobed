Zac has the choice and he\u2019s still deciding. I haven\u2019t committed to any sprinter.\u201d\n\nThe call from Moore regarding the Aethero ride sparked somewhat of a walk down memory lane for Teetan, who recalled his wins on some of the trainer\u2019s superstars of years gone by.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always got opportunities from John, I rode Designs On Rome and Able Friend,\u201d Teetan said. \u201cAethero is something new and exciting.\u201d\n\nNow that he has comes to terms with the allowance that Aethero receives in the Jockey Club Sprint, Moore can\u2019t wait to see the horse take his place after pulling up well from his first Class Two victory.\n\n\u201cEven though he\u2019s up against the very best sprinters in Hong Kong, given that weight allowance you\u2019ve got to think he is a live hope in the race,\u201d Moore said. \u201cHe\u2019s pulled up really, really well. I couldn\u2019t be happier.\u201d", "description": "John Moore has confirmed Karis Teetan will partner star youngster Aethero in the Group Two Jockey Club Sprint (1,200m) on November 17....", "authors": ["Sam Agars", "Tom Biddington", "Trenton Akers"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/16/80857652-efbf-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39_image_hires_112439.JPG?itok=yWdD7mjk&v=1571196286", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
