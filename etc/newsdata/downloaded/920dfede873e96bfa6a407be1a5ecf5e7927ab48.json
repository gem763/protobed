Probably not what you expect. You won't find hyper-obscure scientific terms, for example, because not enough people know them to bother looking them up.\n\nRather, the most looked-up words are ones that are \"middle of the road linguistically\" \u2014 common enough to perpetually perplex readers, as Merriam-Webster lexicographer Kory Stamper told Business Insider.\n\nHere are the 10 most looked-up words and their definitions:\n\nPretentious\n\nSomeone is pretentious if they express unwarranted or exaggerated importance, worth, or stature. Think beer snobs or Prius drivers, as the stereotypes go.\n\nUbiquitous\n\nUbiquitous is used to describe something that is widespread and constantly encountered, like television or fast food.\n\nCynical\n\nSomeone is cynical if they are distrustful of people's motives, or believe that human conduct is motivated primarily by self-interest. A cynical person might question why you offer to do them a favor, thinking to themselves, \"what do they really want?\"\n\nRead more: Scrabble added 300 new words to its dictionary \u2014 these are the 22 most controversial ones you can use to win\n\nApathetic\n\nSimply put, you're apathetic if you don't care about something. A synonym for apathetic is \"indifferent.\"\n\nConundrum\n\nA conundrum is an intricate and difficult problem. According to Merriam-Webster, it's often used to describe seemingly unanswerable questions involving ethics, sociology, and economics, but it can also refer generally to any puzzle or mystery.\n\nAlbeit\n\nAlbeit is a one-word substitute for \"even though,\" like when you describe an extravagant, albeit expensive, night on the town.\n\nMan flips through a dictionary for some answers.

For example, the sentence \"the peasants are revolting\" is ambiguous, because it could mean the peasants are rebelling in the streets, or that they are physically disgusting. We need more information to clear up the ambiguity.\n\nIntegrity\n\nIntegrity is the firm adherence to a code of values. We expect our leaders to act with moral integrity, for example, and musicians who \"sell out\" might get criticized for compromising their artistic integrity.\n\nRead more: I've taught myself 5 languages for fun \u2014 here are 6 tips for getting a language to stick\n\nAffect/Effect\n\nThe definitions of these words aren't confusing, but remembering when to use each one can sure be tricky. A good rule of thumb is that \"affect\" is usually a verb and \"effect\" is usually a noun. The weather can affect your mood, and a new policy can have a devastating effect.\n\nLove\n\nOK, so this one isn't confusing at all, at least when taken at face value. But what exactly is love, if you had to explain it? Merriam-Webster speculates it's that exact question that drives so many people to look up \"love\" in the dictionary. For what it's worth, the dictionary defines love as \"strong affection for another arising out of kinship or personal ties\" or \"attraction based on sexual desire.\"", "description": "The most-looked up words in the Merriam-Webster's dictionary give us a peek into the most confusing words in the English language.", "authors": ["Mark Abadi"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/589d0f013149a1b6008b63c1?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
