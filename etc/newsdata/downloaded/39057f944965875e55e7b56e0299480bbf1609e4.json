Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural Committee.\n\nZhang denounced criticism of China\u2019s actions against the Uyghur Muslims of Xinjiang and its behavior in Hong Kong as \u201cwrongful acts of interfering in China\u2019s internal affairs with the excuse of human rights and provoking confrontation at the United Nations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are someone from some countries who like criticizing developing countries and giving orders on human rights. China urges these countries to abandon hegemonism and power politics, stop all the wrong deeds that go against the trend of history,\u201d he fumed.\n\n\u201cSome countries create troubles everywhere, plot color revolutions, seriously violate human rights of people of relevant countries, and show no remorse for the terrible human rights record of their own,\u201d Zhang said, repeating the same Chinese propaganda infamously parroted by certain American basketball players during their recent trip to China.\n\n\u201cColor revolutions\u201d are a relatively recent addition to Beijing\u2019s talking points. The Chinese use the term to describe regime-change insurrections fomented by hostile outside powers. They frequently describe the Hong Kong protest movement as a nascent \u201ccolor revolution\u201d covertly founded and encouraged by the United States.\n\nChina\u2019s Xinhua news service on Wednesday boasted that \u201clarge-scale labor-intensive industries\u201d are blossoming in Xinjiang province now that the Uyghurs have gotten their minds right:\n\nThe autonomous region, where GDP growth was once one of the slowest in China, is now on the fast track. Most notably, Xinjiang is expected to become a more important part of the \u201cMade in China\u201d value chain, which will allow it to benefit more from the preferential policies of the central government. The West and some anti-China forces often smear China\u2019s Xinjiang policy, but facts speak louder than words. Xinjiang\u2019s unique location and preferential policies have attracted a large number of enterprises. That trend has helped a lot in facilitating the transformation and upgrading of local manufacturing industries. In 2018, profits made by Xinjiang\u2019s large industrial enterprises grew 10 percent year-on-year, while the added value of strategic emerging industries rose by 13.2 percent and high-tech manufacturing soared by 33 percent, according to the government work report for Xinjiang.\n\nThe Xinhua report boasted Xinjiang added 466,700 urban jobs so far in 2019, a 2.62 percent increase over 2018, and all sorts of \u201ctargets\u201d are being met for moving people from impoverished rural areas to the cities, where everything from small businesses to high-tech manufacturing enterprises is \u201csoaring.\u201d\n\nXinhua predicted a \u201cmiracle in China and the world\u201d for the re-educated Uyghurs, who are \u201clikely to offer the Islamic world a development model.\u201d\n\n\u201cRumors about China\u2019s crackdown on freedom of religious belief and violation of human rights in Xinjiang are doomed to be smashed in the face of reality,\u201d the Chinese state media organ predicted.\n\nRadio Free Asia (RFA) on Wednesday offered a hint as to how that process of \u201curbanization\u201d in Xinjiang is being accomplished by noting that fully half of one Uyghur village has been marched off to the concentration camps, joining the roughly 1.5 million people imprisoned there.\n\n\u201cReports suggest that authorities are detaining as many Uyghurs as possible in internment camps and jails regardless of their age, prior service to the ruling Communist Party, or the severity of the accusations against them\u2014as part of a bid to satisfy \u2018quotas\u2019 ordered by the regional government,\u201d RFA wrote.\n\nLocal officials acknowledged rural families are \u201cexperiencing difficulties carrying out their farm labor\u201d with so many of their family members locked away in camps, but assured RFA that \u201cassistance\u201d is readily available from \u201cwork groups\u201d staffed by \u201cvolunteers\u201d largely comprised of university students on summer vacation.", "description": "China rejects accusations of human rights violations and insists the Uyghur Muslims of Xinjiang are becoming happy, productive citizens.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/China-at-U.N.-meeting-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
