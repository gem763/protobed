The countries that scored the lowest were Yemen, Greece and China.\n\nThe U.S. peaked on the World Giving Index in 2014, but has declined since then. The report authors called this a \u201cworrying trend\u201d that\u2019s also happening in other developed countries.\n\n***Could we say the place last year vs. 2014?***\n\nGiving in the U.S. has declined\n\n***I\u2019m confused by this report from June 2019. It\u2019s different from the one that was released today?***\n\nWhile charities in the U.S. took in $427.71 billion in 2018 \u2014 an increase in total dollars from 2017 \u2014 giving by individual Americans dropped by 1.1%, the June 2019 Giving USA report found.\n\n(Giving USA is produced by The Giving Institute, an association of fundraising consultants and firms that service nonprofits, in collaboration with the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy.)\n\nSee also: Why Melinda Gates\u2019s $1 billion pledge for women and girls is a game-changer\n\nThe report\u2019s authors said they would be monitoring how the U.S.\u2019s 2017 tax overhaul affects Americans\u2019 donations to charities, because many have stopped claiming tax deductions for their charitable donations.\n\nA volatile Dow Jones Industrial Index DJIA, +0.09% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.28% are also thought to be a factor dampening giving.\n\nBoth rich and poor countries are generous\n\n\u201cThere is no one trait that points to a country\u2019s generosity,\u201d the World Giving Index authors said. The highest scoring countries \u201crepresent a wide range of geographies, religions, cultures and levels of wealth,\u201d they noted.\n\nWhile seven of the top 10 countries are among the wealthiest in the world, some are much less affluent: Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Indonesia are all classified by the United Nations as lower-middle-income countries, they said.\n\nCultural factors appear to play a role. Both Myanmar and Sri Lanka have many practitioners of Theravada Buddhism, \u201cfor whom small, frequent acts of giving to those living a monastic lifestyle are the norm,\u201d the authors noted.\n\nSeveral African nations \u2014 including Liberia, Sierra Leone, Kenya and Zambia \u2014 topped the list of countries where people were most likely to help a stranger, which the authors said could be linked to the African philosophy of ubuntu, which promotes caring and community.\n\nAmericans say they want to give more\n\nDespite a record-low unemployment rate and growing economy, 56% of Americans say income restraints keep them from giving more money, a separate survey said.\n\nTwo out of three Americans donated to charity within the last year, a recent nationally representative LendingTree survey of 1,079 Americans found.\n\nSome 71% said their debt prevents them from donating as much as they\u2019d like. The average debt-carrying household in 2018 had roughly $144,100 in debt, LendingTree said.", "description": "This latest index is based on Gallup\u2019s World Poll surveys of 1.3 million people.", "authors": ["Leslie Albrecht", "Personal Finance Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT544_americ_ZG_20191017144507.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
