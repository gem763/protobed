How else to explain this from a woman who has literally dozens of claims rated by PolitiFact \u2014 not exactly a bastion of the \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy\u201d \u2014 as either \u201cmostly false\u201d or worse? Give Hillary Clinton credit for arguing against personal interests, I guess (via Twitchy):\n\nFacebook's decision to allow false information in political advertisements is appalling. Voters are being confronted by millions of pieces of misinformation. A world where up is down and down is up is a world where democracy can't thrive. \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 30, 2019\n\nSpeaking of voters being confronted by misinformation, it\u2019s useful to review the most recent ratings from PolitiFact on Hillary\u2019s claims. In March of this year, she claimed that she lost Wisconsin in 2016 because \u2026 she forgot to show up there? Not exactly:\n\n\u201cI was the first person who ran for president without the protection of the Voting Rights Act. I\u2019ll tell you, it makes a really big difference. And it doesn\u2019t just make a difference in Alabama and Georgia. It made a difference in Wisconsin, where the best studies that have been done said somewhere between 40,000 and 80,000 people were turned away from the polls because of the color of their skin, because of their age, because of whatever excuse could be made up to stop a fellow American citizen from voting.\u201d\n\nThat one also earned four Pinocchios from the Washington Post as well as a Pants On Fire rating at PolitiFact. For one thing, Wisconsin wasn\u2019t covered under the special provisions of the Civil Rights Act, which meant that the Supreme Court decision had no impact in that state. That\u2019s one of many problems with that claim, so be sure to read them all.\n\nThe most recent rating given by PolitiFact applied to this bon mot about Wisconsin, delivered last month, in which the numbers changed but the falsehoods stayed the same:\n\n\u201cExperts estimate that anywhere from 27,000 to 200,000 Wisconsin citizen voters, predominantly in Milwaukee, were turned away from the polls,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of potential voters. They showed up, but maybe they didn\u2019t have the correct form of identification. Maybe the name on their driver\u2019s license included a middle name or an initial that wasn\u2019t on their voter registration. But officials made every excuse in the book to prevent certain people from voting in that election.\u201d That\u2019s a lot of people to be \u201cturned away\u201d from polling places. So let\u2019s recap this. Again. Spoiler alert: Clinton\u2019s numbers still aren\u2019t anywhere close to accurate.\n\nThat also got Hillary a Pants on Fire rating. When it comes to misleading voters and promoting misinformation, Facebook has nothing on Hillary Clinton, even when she\u2019s not running for office. We haven\u2019t even dug into the 73 other Mostly False, False, and Pants on Fire ratings she\u2019s collected over the years.\n\nHillary\u2019s ire in this case is directed at Facebook\u2019s decision not to edit or vet paid political advertisements from established candidates and parties, which seems rather \u2026 sensible. Facebook is a medium for advertising, not a generator of it. If this was a case of Facebook creating and then running its own misleading advertising or news articles, then the criticisms might have merit, but in this case Facebook is acting pretty much as most media outlets do in handling advertising. They let voters assess credibility rather than attempt to regulate and censor political messaging.\n\nAs Campbell Brown \u2014 who now runs Facebook News \u2014 pointed out on Twitter, that\u2019s actually an FCC position for broadcasters, too:\n\nDick, as I am sure you know the FCC requires broadcasters like my former network NBC to run ads by politicians true or false. We have the same standard. https://t.co/rjH7kfSBHv \u2014 Campbell Brown (@campbell_brown) October 30, 2019\n\nThe Wall Street Journal sees the political pressure on Facebook to act as censor and concludes that it\u2019s an attempt to silence opposition to the progressive agenda:\n\nNo, the scandal is that Mr. Zuckerberg said two weeks ago that Facebook is committed to supporting free expression. Most scandalously he said his company, like broadcast stations, won\u2019t fact-check candidate election ads. Instead it will allow disputed claims to be debated by the public and press in America\u2019s democratic tradition. \u2026 The media anger about Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s free-speech policy is especially odd. Shouldn\u2019t reporters want to know what candidates are saying so they can dissect and report on it? Instead journalists are offering sophisticated-sounding arguments for why political speech should be controlled by tech companies. One popular argument is that Facebook\u2019s algorithm rewards appeals to emotion so legitimate debate can\u2019t take place. Yet political advocacy in the U.S. has always included emotional appeals. If Facebook\u2019s algorithms favor polarizing content, that\u2019s a separate debate. Others resent the way the platform has upended news delivery in a way that takes power from the press. \u201cThe news media have traditionally borne the responsibility for insuring that the actual purpose of the First Amendment is fulfilled,\u201d said the New Yorker. It\u2019s an unfortunate conceit of some in the media that they ought to have a monopoly on free expression to the exclusion of ordinary people and their elected representatives.\n\nIt\u2019s a bizarre argument against free expression and debate by people whose livelihoods depend on it. Having Hillary champion that argument is even more bizarre, especially with her latest iteration of conspiracy theorizing over which presidential candidates are Russian sleeper agents. Of all the potential poster people for this argument, Hillary is the worst \u2026 and therefore the best for a truly horrid position.", "description": "Ms. Pants on Fire says what?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/hillary-eyes.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
