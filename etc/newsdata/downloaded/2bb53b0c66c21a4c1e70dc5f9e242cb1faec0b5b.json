Mr. Trump\u2019s demeanor on camera was unflappable and compelling. In all, the White House scored a very tidy 10 here, if we\u2019re using say, Olympic-style scoring.\n\nMuch of the news media \u2014 quivering slightly in the aftermath \u2014 got a 0.\n\nWell, to be fair there were some redeeming moments. The broadcast network\u2019s decision to cut into regularly scheduled programming and stick with the actual event until its conclusion was wise and public-minded. Millions of Americans who are not necessarily glued to cable news got a chance to see this one up close and personal, as it happened, as they poured their coffee \u2014 and without the chatter of potentially biased anchors and correspondents. That came later.\n\n\u201cThis is a moment where we should all be proud of our American military and our intelligence community. This is a moment where President Trump\u2019s worst critics should say, \u2018Well done, Mr. President.\u2019\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham told the press in the immediate aftermath.\n\nYes, well. Let the hand wringing begin.\n\n\u201cThe Sunday morning newscasts were awash with anti-Trump journalists whining about President Trump using it a victory for his Middle East policies,\u201d writes Newsbusters.org analyst Nicholas Fondacaro \u2014 who cited NBC News \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Chuck Todd for condemning Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cvictory lap,\u201d and CNN host Jake Tapper for leading \u201ca largely anti-Trump, Obama-era panel of former intelligence community officials during a special two-hour edition of his Sunday show.\n\nMultiple anchors and correspondents also suggested Mr. Trump had either shared too much \u201cintelligence\u201d with the public and not enough with the Democrats, or was inappropriately brusque in his descriptions of the raid.\n\nDespite the querulous coverage, there was no getting around the facts here, no matter how clever the headlines or inventive the speculation. The Trump administration designed and executed a valuable plan which worked \u2014 and Mr. Trump got the point across with candor to a huge global audience while still crediting the positive contributions of several nations to the effort.\n\nSo he also gets some extra points for finesse and diplomacy here.\n\nMR. ROMNEY BLINKS\n\nAnd while we\u2019re knee-deep in this most interesting event, let\u2019s cite a positive moment from Sen. Mitt Romney. The Utah Republicans and former presidential hopeful has been a frequent Trump critic as of late. But not on Sunday.\n\n\u201cAl Baghdadi spread \u2018fire and brimstone\u2019 on earth; now he feels it for himself in hell. To all who arranged his change of venue \u2014 the intel officers, the President, the warriors \u2014 thank you,\u201d Mr. Romney tweeted.\n\nUH, MEANWHILE, THE ECONOMY\n\n\u201cBipartisan consensus has emerged that foreign trade is good. Americans\u2019 broad view of trade is the most positive it has been in more than a quarter-century. As of February 2019, nearly three in four U.S. adults (74%) believe trade represents \u2018an opportunity for economic growth through increased U.S. exports.\u2019 Barely one in five (21%) see trade as more of \u2018a threat to the economy from foreign imports\u2019,\u201d says a new Gallup report by senior analyst Lydia Saad based of comparative polls conducted this year, and assorted historic data dating from 1997.\n\n\u201cBoth Republicans and Democrats have become more positive about trade over this period of improving economic conditions. However, support for trade among both groups jumped sharply after Trump took office in 2017,\u201d the analysis said.\n\nSee more numbers in the Poll du Jour at column\u2019s end.\n\nBEHOLD, THE MYSTERIOUS TRUMP BOOK\n\nGee, stop the presses, the anonymous \u201cTimes\u2019 Op-Ed author\u201d has a book arriving.\n\nWait. You remember this particular anonymous, right?\n\n\u201cThe mystery author known to New York Times readers as \u2018a senior official in the Trump administration\u2019 has a book deal. The anonymous scribe behind the much-discussed op-ed in the newspaper, titled \u2018I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration,\u2019 sold a book to Hachette\u2019s Twelve imprint,\u201d advises Publisher\u2019s Weekly.\n\nThe title is \u201cA Warning\u201d by Anonymous, a senior administration Trump official, and it is set to arrive on the shelves Nov. 19.\n\n\u201cThe author, who will remain nameless, is not accepting an advance for the title and, per his publisher, is dedicating the majority of any potential earnings through royalties to nonprofits that support government accountability and the defense of a free press,\u201d the industry publication said.\n\nThe new book is \u201cexplosive and unprecedented,\u201d and was \u201cwritten under extreme secrecy by someone in the room with the President and other senior administration officials on multiple occasions,\u201d Publisher\u2019s Weekly said.\n\nIn addition, Javelin \u2014 the D.C.-based literary agency which handled the international deal \u2014 has declared that the book will be \u201cthe publishing event of the year.\u201d\n\n\u2018THE BEAST\u2019 GETS A SHOWCASE\n\nTime flies. President Trump and first lady Melania Trump will mark their third Halloween in the White House this week, hosting local school children and military families with much signature style.\n\nMrs. Trump\u2019s office reveals there will be enchanted trees, spirited pumpkins, lots of goodies and kindness, \u201cout of this world objects\u201d courtesy of NASA, a snappy Department of Agriculture tractor, a U.S. Postal Service mail truck \u2014 oh, and one other vehicle of note.\n\n\u201cChildren will also be able to check out the Presidential limo known as \u2018The Beast,\u2019 which is being brought in by the United States Secret Service,\u201d the office advises.\n\nIn a word, yay. The crowd-pleasing Beast draws crowds wherever it rolls.\n\nMuch of its military-grade armoring and serious defense capabilities are classified. Let us say that The Beast is a marvelous beast and leave it at that.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 70% of Americans say trade with other nations has a positive effect on \u201cinnovation ad development of new products.\u201d\n\n\u2022 67% say international trade has a positive effect on U.S. economic growth.\n\n\u2022 63% say trade has a positive effect on American businesses.\n\n\u2022 58% say trade has a positive effect of the quality of products.\n\n\u2022 51% say trade has a positive effect on jobs for U.S. workers.\n\nSource: A Gallup analysis released Friday, based on poll data obtained Feb. 12-18.\n\n\u2022 Helpful information to [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
