An organized-crime group was prowling around the bank's network, looking for flaws in the way it conducted business, until it found one. These criminals learned that the bank had no rules in place for how it managed its contact lists of depositors.\n\nThis oversight allowed the criminals to quickly set up fraudulent accounts. They used a sophisticated scheme whereby they went through the website of an unsuspecting nonprofit in Canada. Within a few hours, the criminals sent out a team of people that used the fraudulent accounts to buy jewelry, electronics, and other goods from 135 merchants in Brazil.\n\nPenny Lane at the Visa Security Summit. Visa\n\nPenny Lane, head of Visa's Payment Fraud Disruption program, says that such errors in business logic have become a significant problem because of the relentless speed and growing cost of cyberattacks. Criminal gangs are looking for vulnerabilities 24/7. And when they find one, they pounce.\n\n\"Hackers aren't kids wearing hoodies,\" she says. \"The attack lanes are becoming swifter because of nation states and sophisticated criminal organizations.\"\n\nAt its recent Security Summit, in San Francisco, Visa announced a series of new capabilities designed to address the evolving threat landscape.\n\nHere are four ways Visa is helping businesses avoid the threat of cybercriminals.\n\nTesting your logic.\n\nVisa Payment Threat Labs tests a company's processing, business logic, and configuration to find vulnerabilities like the ones the UK bank had. \"Our team of experts will analyze a client's environment, rank the vulnerabilities, and provide a confidential report for the client,\" Lane says. \"After the company addresses the problem, we will retest to make sure there are no further issues.\"\n\nWatching your behavior.\n\nWhile criminals are constantly attempting new techniques, they also have established patterns. Visa Vital Signs monitors transactions and alerts a financial institution if something fishy might be going on with its ATMs. The core capability has been around for years, allowing Visa to note if the same account is being used at the same time in three different countries. Now, Visa Vital Signs has been expanded to include behavioral monitoring. It identifies unusual behaviors out of line with how a financial institution typically operates.\n\nMaking an educated guess.\n\nCriminal gangs often use enumeration attacks \u2014 sophisticated and automated methods of guessing account numbers, security codes, expiration dates, and ZIP codes. Visa Account Attack Intelligence performs deep analysis of the billions of transactions it handles. With this knowledge, Visa can identify financial institutions and merchants that may be the victims of enumeration attacks. As a result, they can take defensive steps before criminals cause significant damage.\n\nSkimming off the top.\n\nAround the world, many ecommerce sites are infected with malicious software that skims payment-card data from visitors after they make a purchase. \"This is a ubiquitous problem,\" Lane says. \"A lot of small merchants download free versions of e-commerce software and never update it, leaving them vulnerable to intrusion.\" Visa eCommerce Threat Disruption proactively scans ecommerce sites for this malware. It allows infected sites to be identified sooner to limit harm.\n\nUnlike some services from other vendors, the new payment-security capabilities are available to Visa clients at no additional cost or sign-up. They join Visa's many existing capabilities to safeguard the people, data, and infrastructure in the financial ecosystem.\n\nMargaret Reid, a senior vice president at Visa, says the Visa Security Summit and the new capabilities are part of the company's mission to maintain trust in every transaction, even as the threats evolve.\n\n\"The attack vectors are constantly changing,\" she adds. \"As we move into a digital environment, we're seeing things happen at scale faster, so people have to be more aware and more prepared with knowledge, information, and resources.\"\n\nFind out more about how Visa's security features can help keep your business safe.\n\nThis post was created by Insider Studios with Visa.", "description": "Visa recently introduced new security measures that will better protect businesses from cybercriminals", "authors": ["Sponsor Post", "Created Insider Studios With Visa"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d83d2362e22af3499792c37-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
