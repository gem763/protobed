He moved to New York to work with her, and played a vital part in her 2011 album, Biophilia, on which each song was accompanied by an interactive app uniting concepts of music, science and nature. Merry has remained Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s right-hand man through her 2015 breakup album Vulnicura and this year\u2019s Utopia, as well as making her elaborate masks and headpieces. Their latest project is a full virtual reality version of Vulnicura in which seven VR videos by different directors follow Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s path through heartbreak and recovery in the Icelandic landscape, from a verdant valley into a dark lava tube and out the other side. Merry lives and works in Iceland.\n\nWhy did Bj\u00f6rk decide to make Vulnicura into virtual reality? Most VR experiences focus on spectacle or action, and it\u2019s such an inward, emotional album.\n\nIn 2014, we got an Oculus Rift headset and set it up in her kitchen in New York \u2026 she just got a gut reaction to it, and it also happened to really suit the nature and content of the Vulnicura album. It wasn\u2019t a gimmick, it wasn\u2019t like: \u201cOh, VR is hot, let\u2019s force ourselves to do VR videos\u201d; it was actually more like the weird, airless, almost suffocating and isolating early VR stuff we tried, she realised it could really fit these heartbreak songs... it was just a really good overlap between the medium and the content. I think people are still figuring out how VR is going to position itself in our lives, whether it\u2019s for hardcore gamers who are in there for eight days without eating, or whether it\u2019s a thing in the living room that you order stuff on, or a paintballing businessmen-bonding-trip kind of thing. It still has that fluidity, so I am glad our contribution is an attempt to offer some emotion and poetry and music.\n\nWhat can people expect from Vulnicura VR?\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to make clear that it\u2019s not a game. I think a Bjork video game would be amazing and I would wanna play it, but this isn\u2019t it; it\u2019s quite passive. You\u2019re like a voyeur on this heartbreak album cycle. We\u2019ve made seven VR music videos and accompanying digital scores, and the Vulnicura VR app is like a house to watch them from. You go into a cave at the lowest point of the album and then you come out of the cave for Family, when the healing starts, and then you end with Quicksand when the claustrophobia is gone and you\u2019re in a more open space.\n\nWhat\u2019s it been like watching people experience it all over the world at the Bj\u00f6rk Digital exhibitions?\n\nThe first one we did in Australia, it was amazing hearing the noises: there were people crying, laughing and gasping and people talking to Bj\u00f6rk like she was in the room. For 80%, 90% of the people there it was their first time in VR. So I\u2019m really happy that was their first experience. It\u2019s so beautiful seeing tears coming out of the bottom of a VR headset. It\u2019s like a humanity and technology mashup in a really beautiful way.\n\nThere\u2019s a moment in the Family video where the Bj\u00f6rk avatar seems to walk through the viewer \u2013 it\u2019s quite unsettling.\n\nYes! When we were trying different builds of Notget with [video directors] Nick Thornton Jones and Warren Du Preez, there were also moments when you were inside the avatar, and because I\u2019m a semi-gamer, I was like: \u201cOooh! Oh no! It\u2019s glitching, you can see inside it\u2026\u201d and Bjork was like: \u201cOh my God! This is amazing!\u201d That\u2019s one of my favourite moments, when that avatar in Family stands up and walks towards you, and you float through it and watch it walking away; it\u2019s the most emotional part of the whole album I think.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bjork appears via a live stream as a motion-capture avatar during an event to publicise the Bjork Digital shows.

I don\u2019t wanna be in there for even half an hour, necessarily. I think a music video is perfect for VR. You dip in to this little self-contained world and have an experience with really emotional music and then you dip out again.\n\nWhat other uses of VR are you most excited about?\n\nOutside of art and music, I\u2019ve been reading about people using it for post-traumatic stress, where you can program a situation and go back into it and relive it and reprocess it.\n\nDo you still do art that\u2019s unrelated to Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s projects?\n\nI do have a side project where I hand-embroider my favourite plants and birds and mushrooms on to old Nike and Adidas sportswear sweaters. I probably have about 17 minutes every day to think about that, but I\u2019m going back to Iceland tonight and tomorrow I\u2019m pouring concrete and building myself a little studio at my cabin, where I can get back into my embroidery.\n\nVulnicura VR is available now for Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and Valve Index headsets and is showing at the Otherworld VR arcade in Hackney, London, until 1 Jan", "description": "Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s co-creative director a talks about translating the singer\u2019s Vulnicura album into an out-of-body virtual reality experience", "authors": ["Emily Mackay"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b5607651ca2c7e76e57cf46ee6671a9d4099da0/288_0_3333_2000/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0e2bb75bd7dda9197bd1f78d199daa66", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
