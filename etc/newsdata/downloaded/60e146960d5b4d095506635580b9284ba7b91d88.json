(Susan Walsh/AP)\n\nIn 2017, the United States extracted from Russia an important CIA source who had provided information about the Kremlin\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election, according to current and former officials.\n\nThe operation, known as an exfiltration, followed mounting concerns among U.S. officials that the individual, whose identity is unknown, could be discovered by the Russian government.\n\nThe exfiltration took place sometime after an Oval Office meeting in May 2017, when President Trump revealed highly classified counterterrorism information to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador, said the current and former officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive operation.\n\nThat disclosure alarmed U.S. national security officials, but it was not the reason for the decision to remove the CIA asset, who had provided information to the United States for more than a decade, according to the current and former officials.\n\nThe exfiltration was first reported by CNN. The CIA declined to comment.\n\nU.S. officials had been concerned that Russian sources could be at risk of exposure as early as the fall of 2016, when the Obama administration first confirmed that Russia had stolen and publicly disclosed emails from the Democratic National Committee and the account of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta.\n\nIn October 2016, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a joint statement that intelligence agencies were \u201cconfident that the Russian Government directed\u201d the hacking campaign.\n\n\u201cWe believe . . . that only Russia\u2019s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,\u201d the statement said.\n\nEarlier drafts of the statement had accused Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin by name, but the reference was removed out of concern that it could endanger sources and methods, The Washington Post reported.\n\nIn January 2017, the Obama administration published a detailed assessment that unambiguously laid the blame on the Kremlin, concluding that \u201cPutin ordered an influence campaign\u201d and that Russia\u2019s goal was to undermine faith in the U.S. democratic process and harm Clinton\u2019s chances of winning.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty remarkable intelligence community product \u2014 much more specific than what you normally see,\u201d one U.S. official said. \u201cIt\u2019s very expected that potential U.S. intelligence assets in Russia would be under a higher level of scrutiny by their own intelligence services.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite likely,\u201d the official continued, \u201cthat the U.S. intelligence community would already be taking a hard look at extracting any U.S. assets who would have been subject to increased levels of scrutiny\u201d after the assessment\u2019s publication. Part of it relied on communications intercepts and human intelligence, the official said. The Russians \u201cundoubtedly would have been conducting a review as to who within Putin\u2019s inner circle would have had access to the information.\u201d \u200b\n\nLast year, Russian operatives traveled to England and used a nerve agent to try to kill a former Russian military intelligence officer, Sergei Skripal, who had become a British spy, according to U.S. and British officials. In 2006, Russian operatives killed former intelligence officer Alexander Litvinenko in London by placing radioactive material in his tea, according to a British investigation.\n\nCurrent and former officials said an exfiltration is a methodical process not normally triggered by a single event. It takes time to arrange for the asset, and potentially family members, to be secretly removed from the country and resettled.\n\nServing as an asset or informant is dangerous work, and as the potential for exposure increases, \u201cthen it\u2019s not a surprise that these people are extracted,\u201d said one former senior U.S. official. \u201cThat\u2019s the good-news story.\u201d\n\nThe current location of the Russian asset is not known.", "description": "Concerns that Russia would determine who was spying for the United States mounted after officials revealed Putin\u2019s role in attacking the 2016 election.", "authors": ["Shane Harris", "Intelligence", "National Security Reporter", "Ellen Nakashima", "September At Pm", "Shane Harris Covers Intelligence", "National Security For The Post.
