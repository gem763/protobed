He pitched in 178 games with the team but struggled out of the bullpen this year, with an ERA of 6.36 in 51 total games.\n\nWhen a player is designated for assignment a team has 10 days to trade, release, put him on waivers or return him to the 40-man roster.\n\nOther moves included the return of lefty reliever Roenis Elias from the injured list after a hamstring injury, while right-handed reliever Hunter Strickland returned from the paternity list. Earlier catcher Spencer Kieboom was sent back to Double-A Harrisburg, which starts the Eastern League playoffs Wednesday on the road.\n\nLefty closer Sean Doolittle is expected to return from the injured list this weekend. The Athletic reported he would throw in a minor league rehab game Friday in Frederick with Single-A Potomac, the Carolina League farm team of Washington.\n\nThe Nationals (74-58) entered Friday 5 \u00bd games back of first-place Atlanta in the National League East but held the top Wild Card spot.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
