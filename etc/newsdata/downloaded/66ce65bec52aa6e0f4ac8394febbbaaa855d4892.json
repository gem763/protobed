Meanwhile, Britain is holding a new election on Dec. 12.\n\n\n\n\u201cIrrespective of the political backdrop, transaction activity has been on an upward trajectory,\u201d said Tom Bill, the brokerage\u2019s head of residential research.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta An LVMH Takeover of Tiffany Could Expand the Global Reach of Little Blue Box\n\nOn average, prices in Prime Central London are now 14% lower than four years ago, which more than compensates for higher rates of stamp duty.\n\n\n\nStarting April 2016, the U.K. raised the stamp duty by 3% on second homes over \u00a340,000. For a \u00a32 million property, that means a buyer has to pay an extra \u00a360,000 in taxes.\n\n\n\nSince then, many luxury buyers have adopted a wait-and-see attitude, which dampened the demand for prime properties, and sales prices fell consequently.\n\n\n\nThe price adjustment, combined with the favorable exchange rates for most overseas buyers, translates into a more than 25% discount in Prime Central London, Knight Frank said.\n\n\n\nAverage prices for existing homes in Prime Central London fell 3.9% in the year to September, the smallest decline in 12 months, according to the report.\n\n\n\nThe brokerage didn\u2019t release concrete data for sales and prices.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Fang Block"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-122202?size=1.5005861664712778&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
