While iTunes\u2019 simple functionality blew the socks off iPod users when it debuted in 2003, streaming services like Apple Music now dominate our listening habits.\n\nApple\u2019s other big innovation, the iPhone, also helped to stomp iTunes into the curb. Folks walking around with internet-enabled smartphones in their pocket don\u2019t really need to stash a dedicated mp3 player too, making iTunes on Mac increasingly redundant for the mass market.\n\nOverall, the decision to demote iTunes seems like part of Apple\u2019s plan to siphon users to its own proprietary streaming services.\n\nBillboard reports Apple Music subscribers will not be able to access the iTunes Music store on Mac unless they manually reactivate it, while iTunes\u2019 lingering film and television content, for purchase or rent, will be jumbled with Apple TV\u2019s streaming options.\n\nYou should know:\n\nAll your old iTunes purchases and rips should be in the Music app after you upgrade to Catalina.\n\nYou can still buy music in the iTunes store.\n\nIf you don't see the store in the Music app sidebar, open the Music app Preferences, General, and look for the checkbox. pic.twitter.com/7tWBOopbOl \u2014 Macworld (@macworld) October 7, 2019\n\nBut the change won\u2019t sever audiophiles from their meticulous collections \u2013 yet, at least. Music bought from the iTunes store, or ripped into the program from CDs, will remain available for users in the Apple Music app.\n\nBackups and iPhone syncs will be handled by Finder from here on out, FYI.\n\nDid Apple actually nail it the first time around, when iPods and iTunes actually gave digital users complete control over their music collections? Yes, but whatever. Long live the stream.", "description": "The latest macOS update splits it into Apple Music, Apple TV and Apple Podcasts apps.", "authors": ["David Adams"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/itunes-massacre.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
