So, it's interesting that them just asking for a comment from ICE is enough to provoke this other liberal group on campus... they're asking for them not to do it. It's interesting how they are going up against each other.\"\n\nDENNIS PRAGER: 'NO SAFE SPACES' SHOWS THE LEFT AS 'A PURELY DESTRUCTIVE FORCE'\n\nPart of the petition read: \"We are extremely disappointed in the cultural insensitivity displayed by The Crimson's policy to reach out to ICE... in this political climate, a request for comment is virtually the same as tipping them off.\"\n\nThe petition was originally started by a student immigration group named, \"Act on a Dream\" earlier this month. They took issue with The Crimson requesting comment from an ICE spokesperson for its Sept. 13 article, \u201cHarvard Affiliates Rally for Abolish ICE Movement.\u201d The article was about a Sept. 12 protest hosted by \"Act on a Dream\" and used quotes from several students who criticized ICE.\n\nThe Crimson released a statement addressing the issue and said their readership has a right to the facts and claimed that reaching out to all sides is a basic pillar of good journalism.\n\n\"Our readers have the right to be informed about the place where they live, work, and study,\" the statement read. \"In pursuit of that goal, we seek to follow a commonly accepted set of journalist standards... Foremost among those standards is the belief that every party named in a story has a right to comment or contest criticism leveled against them.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"We live in a cultural and legal system that prides itself on free speech,\" Colby added.\n\n\"They might have problems with ICE, and they might want to have that dialogue. But they don't even want our school newspaper -- our very public, very communal school newspaper -- to have any perspective whatsoever on what ICE is thinking.\"", "description": "Following attempts by Harvard's school newspaper, The Crimson, to reach out to ICE for comment on an immigration story, over 700 students signed a petition claiming the request\u00a0was akin to tipping off the government and selling\u00a0out the university to a federal agency.", "authors": ["Nick Givas", "Nick Givas Is A Reporter With Fox News.
