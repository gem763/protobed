They point to two words: \u201cpremised importantly.\u201d\n\n\u201cRevealingly, participants noted that low borrowing costs and high equity prices were \u2018premised importantly\u2019 on expected Fed rate cuts,\u201d Capital Economics\u2019 Michael Pearce wrote on Wednesday. \u201cTranslation: The Fed is petrified of upsetting the markets and will therefore continue cutting rates.\u201d (emphasis added)\n\nHere\u2019s the full quote from the July FOMC minutes for context: \u201cParticipants observed that current financial conditions appeared to be premised importantly on expectations that the Federal Reserve would ease policy to help offset the drag on economic growth stemming from the weaker global outlook and uncertainties associated with international trade as well as to provide some insurance to address various downside risks.\u201c\n\nYahoo Finance All Markets Summit More\n\nSo, by not providing the easing expected by the market, the Fed recognized that it could be directly contributing to the forces hindering the economy.\n\nNomura\u2019s Lewis Alexander agreed with this assessment: \u201cThis is consistent with the view that the market\u2019s expectations for the Fed action played a role in the decision to cut rates in July.\u201d\n\nThe Fed said this before the July rate cut\n\nThis is actually not the first time the Fed connected financial conditions with rate cut expectations by employing the words \u201cpremised importantly.\u201d This was from the June FOMC minutes: \u201cWhile overall financial conditions remained supportive of growth, those conditions appeared to be premised importantly on expectations that the Federal Reserve would ease policy in the near term to help offset the drag on economic growth stemming from uncertainties about the global outlook and other downside risks.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Barclays economist Jonathan Miller argued that \u201cthis acknowledgment greatly strengthens the case for rate cuts in July; members will be worried about a back-up in financial conditions.\u201d\n\nNomura\u2019s Alexander also flagged the language, saying that \u201cpolicymakers are mindful of the potential inadvertent negative impact on financial markets stemming from inaction.\u201d\n\nThe Fed went on to cut rates for the first time since 2008, an event that was widely priced into the markets.\n\n\u2018Levering the outlook to self-determined financial conditions\u2019\n\nOn Thursday, BNP Paribas economists wrote that they were \u201cstruck\u201d by this language when they saw it in June, further noting that the Fed \u201cappeared to acknowledge its own role in maintaining the accommodation of financial conditions that it exogenously factors into the economy.\u201d (emphasis added)\n\nBy acknowledging its own role in this way, the Fed then is effectively referring to itself when it speaks of financial conditions. With this in mind, BNP found another statement in the July FOMC minutes to be telling.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks on a television as traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, U.S., February 27, 2018. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson More\n\n\u201c[W]hile the Committee has long factored financial conditions as an important input into the outlook, the July Minutes took it a step further, with the Committee stating that its outlook for continued sustained expansion of activity \u2018was predicated on financial conditions that were more accommodative than earlier this year,\u2019\u201d the economists said.\n\nThey unpacked this a bit: \u201cThe Committee appears to be acknowledging that: 1) accommodative financial conditions are underpinning its current outlook for continued expansion; and 2) market expectations of further cuts are in turn underpinning such accommodative financial conditions.\u201d", "description": "In its recent FOMC minutes, the Federal Reserve has used language that suggests its decision-making is affected by what's happening in the financial markets.", "authors": ["Sam Ro", "Managing Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GQaRymAinBwFc3Cwkf7DWA--~B/aD0xMzE0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-08/70f6a6d0-c502-11e9-b71f-30e2e2fd6a79", "published_at": "2019-08-22"}
