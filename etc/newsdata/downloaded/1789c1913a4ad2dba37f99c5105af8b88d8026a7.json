ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. We are cowards.\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s the passionate message from a Twitter TWTR, -2.28% account named after Esteghlal, \u201cthe most decorated club in Iran.\u201d\n\nThe tweet was referring to Sahar Khodayari, a 29-year-old female Iranian soccer fan dubbed \u201cBlue Girl,\u201d who, according to the Guardian, died after setting herself on fire outside a courtroom. She was facing six months in prison for attempting to enter Tehran\u2019s Azadi stadium and watch her favorite team.\n\nKhodayari was apparently dressed up as a man, wearing a blue hairpiece and a long overcoat when the police apprehended her.\n\nBefore her death, FIFA had been urging Iran to change the rules and imposed a deadline this summer to lay out what steps were being taken to allow women to attend World Cup qualifiers, which will be held in the country next month.\n\n\u201cWhilst we are aware of the challenges and cultural sensitivities, we simply have to continue making progress here, not only because we owe it to women all over the world, but also because we have a responsibility to do so, under the most basic principles set out in the FIFA Statutes,\u201d FIFA\u2019s president wrote a letter obtained by the New York-based Centre for Human Rights in Iran.\n\nMeanwhile, soccer players and many others from around the world voiced their outrage across social media in the wake of Khodayari\u2019s death:\n\nI have a platform and I have never been afraid of raising my voice when in need.This is a tragedy and it can\u2019t continue anymore. @FIFAcom it\u2019s time to act and not be silent.WE need to help the women of Iran fight against gender apartheid.This is about human rights!#SaharKhodayari https://t.co/UE4r071Niv \u2014 Kosovare Asllani (@KosovareAsllani) September 10, 2019\n\nThe death of #BlueGirl must not be in vain. #Iran is the only country in the world that stops and punishes women for entering football stadiums. This ban must end immediately. https://t.co/z63u2DH3kq \u2014 Amnesty UK (@AmnestyUK) September 10, 2019", "description": "A 29-year-old female Iranian soccer fan, dubbed \u201cBlue Girl,\u201d died after setting herself on fire outside a courtroom.
