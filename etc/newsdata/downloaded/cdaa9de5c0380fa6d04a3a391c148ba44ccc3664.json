Kamala Harris\u2018 preferred gender pronouns during the network\u2019s televised LGBTQ town hall.\n\nMr. Cuomo assured the LGBTQ community that he is an \u201cally\u201d after some took issue with him joking about sharing female pronouns with Ms. Harris.\n\nDuring the town hall, Ms. Harris entered the stage and immediately specified that her preferred gender pronouns are \u201cshe, her and hers.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe, her and hers?\u201d Mr. Cuomo asked. \u201cMine too.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Ms. Harris responded.\n\nMr. Cuomo later tweeted that he was \u201csorry\u201d for the faux pas.\n\n\u201cPLEASE READ: When Sen. Harris said her pronouns were she her and her\u2019s, I said mine too,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI should not have. I apologize. I am an ally of the LGBTQ community, and I am sorry because I am committed to helping us achieve equality. Thank you for watching our townhall.\u201d\n\nLGBTQ advocacy groups GLAAD and National Center for Lesbian Rights condemned the joke.\n\nKamala Harris declared her pronouns on such a major stage and she should be applauded but instead it was so disappointing for Chris Cuomo to mock it in that moment. #EqualityTownHall #PowerOfOurPride \u2014 GLAAD (@glaad) October 11, 2019\n\nDear @ChrisCuomo, people\u2019s pronouns are not a punchline. In a year where LGBTQ Americans are finally being recognized on the national Presidential stage, making jokes about gender pronouns is beneath your dignity. Please do better in the future. #EqualityTownHall \u2014 National Center for Lesbian Rights (@NCLRights) October 11, 2019\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
