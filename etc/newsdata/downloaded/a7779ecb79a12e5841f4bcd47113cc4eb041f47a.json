Here\u2019s what you can get, and how to get involved before the deadline.\n\nWhat is a Help to Buy ISA?\n\nThe Help to Buy ISA is essentially a special type of bank account where the state adds up to 25% extra on top of your savings for a house.\n\nAs well as that, these ISAs have a higher interest rate than most savings accounts, so you could get 2.58% interest tax-free on what you put in.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nWhile unlimited free money would be ideal, there are some limits.\n\nIn the first month of your ISA, you can put in up to \u00a31,200, which the government will give you your 25% bonus on. After that, the limit is \u00a3200 (which again will have the bonus).\n\nAlthough you can open the account with less than the \u00a31,200 limit, the best way to maximise your bonus is to put in as much as you can first time around.\n\nIf you maximise the savings limits, you can make \u00a33,400 into at least \u00a34,250 not including interest.\n\nIt\u2019s a tricky old business (Picture: Getty)\n\nThe maximum the government will add in total is \u00a33,000, and you need to have saved at least \u00a31,600 to get any bonus at all (which will net you \u00a3400 extra).\n\nAlthough the deadline to start the ISA is coming up, the government has stated they\u2019ll continue the scheme until 2030, so you could continue paying into it until then.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven if you\u2019re buying in the near future, though, it\u2019s absolutely makes sense to start saving through a Help to Buy ISA, as there\u2019s no minimum amount of time you can save for \u2013 again, you just need the minimum \u00a31,600 saved to get your top-up.\n\nYou do have to use the money for a property, too. As it\u2019s targeted at first-time buyers, you can purchase any home under \u00a3250,000 \u2013 or \u00a3450,000 in London \u2013 as long as you\u2019re taking out a residential mortgage (rather than buy-to-let).\n\nUnlike some Help to Buy schemes, you don\u2019t specifically need to buy a new build or have a Help to Buy mortgage (although you can if you want, of course).\n\nWho is eligible for a Help to Buy ISA?\n\nAny first-time buyers who are over 16 can open a Help to Buy ISA.\n\nThose who already own a home aren\u2019t able to, which seems pretty fair really given you\u2019ve already got a sweet, sweet property.\n\nCan you get a Help to Buy ISA if you\u2019re a couple?\n\nYou can\u2019t get a Help to Buy ISA as a couple, but you can get them individually as long as each of you are eligible.\n\nAs long as you\u2019re both first-time buyers, you can each open them separately, saving up to \u00a3400 in total.\n\nIf your partner already owns property, you can still open a Help to Buy ISA yourself, putting away up to \u00a3200 a month.\n\nPlease don\u2019t use this savings method (Picture: Getty)\n\nWhat are the downsides of a Help to Buy ISA?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs mentioned before, you can\u2019t get a buy-to-let mortgage if you use a Help to Buy ISA to buy your property. If that\u2019s part of your dastardly plans, this isn\u2019t the scheme for you.\n\nAnother downside is that, as a government scheme, it could be subject to change in the years ahead. Although you technically have 30 years to do your savings, if the law changes in this time it might mean you\u2019ll get no more \u2018free\u2019 cash.\n\nWhile not the end of the world, it does mean you should try to save as much as possible (up to the aforementioned limits) as quickly as possible. This will also help you make the most of your cash before prices rises over the years.\n\nThere\u2019s also a caveat in that the 25% top-up that comes from the government won\u2019t actually go through until the sale is completed.\n\nSo, while you can use the money you\u2019ve personally put away as part of the \u2018exchange deposit\u2019, which is handed over when contracts are exchanged, and instead get the bonus as part of the \u2018mortgage deposit\u2019 that goes through upon completion.\n\nBasically, you\u2019ll still need either 5% or 10% of the purchase price of your house up front (before the bonus) in most cases, but talk to your broker or bank to make sure.\n\nFor those of you unsure on buying a house, it\u2019s worth noting, too, that you won\u2019t get your bonus if you decide to take your savings out without purchasing. You will get your money back, as well as any interest due.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can also make partial withdrawals if necessary, but the bonus will only be applied to the amount you have in the account when you do buy a house.\n\nDo your homework first, check if it\u2019s the right option for you, and get in there quick if it is.\n\nWhy the Help to Buy ISA is being stopped and when it ends\n\nThe Help to Buy ISA closes to new savers on 30 November 2019.\n\nThis is to be replaced by the Lifetime Isa or LISA, a similar product for first-time buyers or those saving for retirement.\n\nIf you manage to get your foot in the door (with up to \u00a31,200), however, you\u2019re able to keep saving until November 2029, and claim your cash bonus from the government until November 2030.\n\nHow to set up a Help to Buy ISA\n\nYou set up a Help to Buy ISA as you would any other bank or savings account.\n\nDifferent banks will offer different interest rates and benefits, and you don\u2019t have to open yours with the same bank you\u2019re already with or the one you plan on getting your mortgage with.\n\nIt\u2019s worth checking on comparison sites first to get the best deal for your needs.\n\nHow to claim your bonus when you buy a home\n\nRather than simply going straight into the ISA as you save, the government 25% top-up has to be claimed when you buy a house.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to let your ISA provider know that you\u2019re buying a house, at which point they\u2019ll close the account and transfer over the money you\u2019ve saved.\n\nThey\u2019ll also send a letter to your solicitor that\u2019ll allow them to claim the bonus for you, and this will be transferred upon completion.\n\nMORE: You can buy a Big Mac for just 99p from McDonald\u2019s next week\n\nMORE: Woman\u2019s self esteem dropped after brain tumour caused nose and chin to grow\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "With less than a month to claim your Help to Buy ISA, we look at who is eligible and what you can benefit from.", "authors": ["Jessica Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1140404399_1572450520.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
