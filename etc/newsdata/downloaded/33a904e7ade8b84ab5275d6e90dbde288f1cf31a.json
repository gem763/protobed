The layoffs were disclosed in an August 29 notice with the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity.\n\nIn early August, Transformco said it would close 26 stores by October. Transformco, however, declined to comment on media reports that as many as 100 additional Sears and Kmart stores would close by year-end. Some of the closings have been posted online on sites including thelayoff.com.\n\n\"We're not providing a list of any of the more recent closings,\" Sears spokesman Larry Costello told CBS MoneyWatch. Instead, the company is responding to queries \"at a local level,\" he added.\n\nFormer Sears exec says retailer has been on \"death spiral\" for decade\n\nAt one time the country's biggest retailer, Sears declared bankruptcy in October amid slowing growth and weighed down by billions in debt. Lampert, the company's former CEO and largest shareholder, bought it and 425 stores in February in a bankruptcy auction.\n\nIn winning a judge's approval to buy what remained of Sears for $5.2 billion, Lampert touted his plan as a means of saving as many as 50,000 jobs and said he was setting aside funds to pay workers' severance.\n\nThe company reiterated that pledge in its statement on store closures last month. \"As we promised, all eligible associates will be offered the same number of weeks of severance as offered to employees of Sears Holdings Corporation prior to that company's Chapter 11 filing in October 2018,\" Transformco stated at the time.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Costello declined to say whether laid-off workers would get severance.", "description": "Struggling retailer still shrinking, but the hedge fund that bought it out of bankruptcy won't say how much", "authors": ["Kate Gibson"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/01/08/9fe9cf05-d2ac-44d7-930a-f126726145cb/thumbnail/1200x630/da3d11b1c1929283f5834cba262023f4/2019-01-08t120501z-650949300-rc146b2d77d0-rtrmadp-3-sears-bankruptcy-tweets.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
