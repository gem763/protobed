Pete Buttigieg wants to cut the incarcerated population in half. Joe Biden, who helped to author the infamous 1994 crime bill as a senator, is urging \u201credemption and rehabilitation.\u201d And Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor, just released a sweeping proposal to transform the system and end mass incarceration.\n\nThe Democratic front-runners all agree that the U.S. imprisons too many people (around 2.2 million in 2017) and that people of color have been disproportionately affected. Some, like Harris, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have released comprehensive plans to address the crisis, which include efforts to tackle the root causes of crime, like poverty and homelessness, and calls to eliminate the mandatory sentencing laws ushered in by the war on drugs.\n\nBut largely absent in these proposals is a public reckoning with the primary cause of America\u2019s high prison population: violent crime. Over half the people serving time in state prisons, which house the majority of the U.S.\u2019s prisoners, are convicted of violent offenses, ranging from robbery to murder. Yet only Harris\u2019 proposal explicitly mentions violent crime as an underlying driver of mass incarceration. Her plan would create a commission to study the issue and make policy recommendations.\n\n\n\nExperts interviewed by HuffPost warned that meaningful reform requires changing how the U.S. punishes violent crime, not just ending the war on drugs. They also cautioned that drawing a hard line between violent and nonviolent crime, as some candidates have done on the campaign trail, obscures a more complicated reality.\n\n\n\n\u201cFrankly, those who think we can eliminate mass incarceration without dealing with violent crimes are committing a math error,\u201d said Keith Wattley, executive director of UnCommon Law, a nonprofit law firm in California. \u201cMost of these proposals are silent on the issue of serious and violent crimes. And silence really signals acquiescence.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn the two double-feature Democratic presidential debates to date, the candidates (and, to be fair, the moderators) have devoted scant time to criminal justice. Beto O\u2019Rourke brought up mass incarceration but framed it around marijuana legalization. Warren went after private prisons, which house only 8% of the country\u2019s incarcerated population. Others talked about gun violence. Criminal justice advocates hope that at the next debate on Sept. 12. candidates will be pressed for a fuller discussion.\n\n\n\nName The Problem\n\n\n\nThe rate of incarceration in the United States has more than quadrupled in the past four decades, and scholars are still debating why.\n\n\n\nA 2014 report by the National Academy of Sciences attributes the rise to mandatory sentences, longer sentences, overzealous prosecutors and harsher enforcement of drug laws. Policies such as \u201cthree strikes\u201d laws, which require sentences of 25 years to life after a person is convicted of a third felony, and \u201ctruth in sentencing\u201d laws, which force people to serve most of their sentences before qualifying for parole, have resulted in more people spending more time behind bars.\n\n\n\nBut while the war on drugs undeniably contributed to mass incarceration, the majority of people in state prisons, which account for 88% of the total U.S. prison population, are there on convictions for violent crimes. Only 15% of people in state prisons are held for drug crimes. (Federal prisons, which house 12% of the U.S. prison population, are a little different. There, about 45% of inmates are convicted of drug offenses.)\n\n\n\nThe public is woefully misinformed about these facts. A 2016 poll by Morning Consult and Vox found that the majority of people erroneously believe that nearly half of all U.S. prisoners are incarcerated for drug offenses. When asked if they supported reducing prison time for nonviolent offenders, an overwhelming majority of respondents said yes. But only 29% felt the same way about people who committed a violent crime, even if the individual had a low risk of reoffending.\n\n\n\nJohn Pfaff, author of \u201cLocked In\u201d and professor at Fordham Law School, believes these attitudes are intertwined.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because we believe that everyone\u2019s in prison for drugs that we don\u2019t have to ask these hard questions of violence,\u201d he said. \u201cPoliticians are afraid to talk about it. So they talk about drugs and that reinforces people\u2019s belief that everyone\u2019s there for drugs. It\u2019s a hard cycle to snap out of.\u201d\n\nPfaff commended Harris for noting the central role that violent crime plays in driving prison populations, but said he wished she\u2019d gone further.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that she demands action now when it comes to how we handle drugs, but pushes the issue of violence to a commission \u2015 even though we have the data to change how we approach violence now too,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Plans\n\n\n\nIn some ways, the current debate over criminal justice reform is historic. Most 2020 Democratic candidates are now openly opposed to the death penalty and want to legalize marijuana \u2015 positions relegated to the fringe in past election cycles.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe way they are talking about criminal justice is dramatically different from what we\u2019ve heard before in a presidential campaign,\u201d said Marc Mauer, executive director of The Sentencing Project.\n\n\n\nHe praised the candidates for thinking systemically about the causes of crime and focusing on prevention. Warren\u2019s plan, for example, connects the dots between adverse childhood experiences, such as poverty and homelessness, and later involvement in the criminal justice system. Sanders\u2019 plan emphasizes the need to address the social and environmental conditions that lead to crime and calls for increased funding for violence interruption models.\n\n\n\nBut to truly reduce the prison population, the U.S. needs to shorten sentences, including for violent crimes, Mauer said. That will require comprehensive sentencing reform.\n\n\n\nIn theory, a number of candidates have endorsed such reforms. Warren, Sanders and Biden, for example, have said they want to reduce or eliminate mandatory minimum laws, which require judges to sentence people to a specific prison term for a specific crime. But none of the candidates have explained what this would mean in practice: a radical rethinking of how we punish violence.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are not articulating what the problem is, and difficult as it is, why it needs to be addressed,\u201d said Mauer, who proposed a 20-year cap on sentences in his book \u201cThe Meaning of Life,\u201d arguing that many people age out of crime and pose little risk to public safety. The U.S.\u2019s excessively long sentences are an outlier compared to much of the world, he said, and the practice is counterproductive and costly.\n\n\n\nReconsidering how to handle people who commit violent crimes raises complicated and uncomfortable questions. The criminal justice system is riddled with cases like this man, who served 36 years behind bars for robbing a bank of $50 \u2015 considered a violent crime \u2015 when he was 22. But tougher are the cases that involve a serious injury or death. How long should someone who commits murder but who is no longer deemed dangerous be held in prison? Does it make sense for a woman who kills her abusive husband to spend the rest of her life behind bars? Should a person who sells drugs that are later connected to an overdose spend three decades in prison on homicide charges? Could some violent crimes be dealt with using alternatives to incarceration, such as restorative justice, as one group in Brooklyn is now doing?\n\n\n\nMauer said he was encouraged by legislation written by presidential hopeful and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) that would allow federal prisoners who have served more than 10 years of their sentence to petition a judge for a reduced sentence or early release. Crucially, the bill does not exclude people convicted of violent crimes.\n\n\n\nStill, in the press release touting the legislation, Booker talks only about the impact of the drug war. And on his campaign website, he promises to extend clemency to individuals serving excessive sentences \u2015 but only for nonviolent drug crimes.\n\n\n\nThe Power Of The Pulpit\n\nPresidents have limited power to reform the criminal justice system writ large, as states and local districts set their own policies, said Pfaff, the Fordham professor. The federal government can wield some influence by offering grant money to states that adopt certain programs or policies, but ultimately, its impact is minimal.\n\n\n\nWhere presidents can do is set the agenda, he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cImagine if someone like Warren or Sanders or Biden got up and said, \u2018Look, we need to talk about how we punish violence. We are harsh on it in a way that baffles Europeans, in a way that flies in the face of what we know about what deters behavior, and we do it in a brutal and inhumane way that is often counterproductive,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat statement alone would do more than any 50-page policy would do.\u201d\n\n\n\nWattley, the executive director of UnCommon Law, agreed.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt could set the tone for what people are willing to say, and what people are willing to risk,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nHe urged the candidates to stop making a distinction between nonviolent and violent crimes when talking about the need for reform.\n\n\n\nThe line is not as clear-cut as the public might imagine, he said. Some individuals convicted of drug crimes also committed violent crimes but pleaded to the lesser charge; some violent crimes are directly related to drug activity.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those false distinctions, but the underlying causes [of the crime] are often the same,\u201d he said. \u201cWe pretend that there\u2019s an added evil component to people who commit violence. That\u2019s just not my experience.\u201d\n\n\n\nKristen Bell, an assistant professor at University of Oregon School of Law, said she understands why candidates wouldn\u2019t want to speak openly about changing how the country treats violence, especially as Democrats have long been branded as weak on crime by Republican opponents.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard as a politician who wants to get elected to run on a platform of releasing people from prison who have committed murder and rape, right?\u201d she said. But stressing the difference between violent and nonviolent crimes sends the wrong message, she added.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt legitimizes the way we incarcerate people who commit violence and makes it seem like it\u2019s OK and not in need of change,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just not true. We need to be talking about them because they are the majority of people in prison.\u201d", "description": "They\u2019re focusing on the war on drugs, but that\u2019s not why most people are in prison.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7669ac2300009b03512927.jpeg?cache=hx0v7r5reu&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
