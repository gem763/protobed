REUTERS/Mohamed Nureldin Abdallah\n\nUnder deposed president Omar al-Bashir, who was toppled in April after months of protests, Sudan was governed using a strict interpretation of sharia law and largely neglected women\u2019s participation in sports.\n\nBut both male and female fans cheered in the stands as the Eltahadi and Eldifaa teams graced the country\u2019s oldest sports stadium in the capital Khartoum in the league\u2019s opening match on Monday.\n\n\u201cNot all of Sudanese society accepts (women\u2019s football), but a small group does and they support us,\u201d said Eltahadi player Nariman Lino.\n\n\u201cWe will continue, and do what we can, until the rest of the Sudanese people accept it.\u201d\n\nThe league includes 21 teams from across Sudan and the match was officiated by female referees. A past attempt at an unofficial women\u2019s league featured only three Khartoum teams.\n\n\u201cAt the start we struggled, firstly with acceptance of the idea (of women\u2019s football), and then with the fact that we couldn\u2019t even find a pitch to train on,\u201d said Duria Taqialdin, Eltahadi\u2019s manager.\n\n\u201cThe union gave us a space, not even really a pitch, but we cleaned it up and made it into one. We named it the graveyard, because anyone who came to play us there would lose.\u201d\n\nSudan\u2019s new prime minister, Abdalla Hamdok, has said female participation across society is a priority for his government, citing the prominent role of women in the protests that brought down Bashir.\n\n\u201cThere is now the political will to make women\u2019s sports one of the pillars of the country\u2019s development and we will work to provide the infrastructure for (it),\u201d said Walaa Elboushi, the minister of youth and sport in the transitional cabinet.\n\nAisha Musa, one of two female members of Sudan\u2019s 11-person joint military-civilian sovereign council, attended Monday\u2019s match as a special guest.\n\n\u201cOur dream is to move forward, we want to participate in the (women\u2019s) World Cup, and we want to raise Sudan\u2019s name up high,\u201d said Huda Ali, a goalkeeper for Eltahadi.", "description": "Sudan has launched a women's football league, a move that reflects the new transitional government's aspirations for the country and allows female players to push for wider acceptance.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436560323&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920IA-OZASP"}
