That means that the lawmakers are still in session and will continue the debate over Brexit that was short-circuited when Mr. Johnson asked the queen to suspend, or prorogue, Parliament for five weeks.\n\n\u201cThe decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue Parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of Parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification,\u201d said Baroness Hale, the president of the court, speaking for the 11-judge panel that heard the case.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect,\u201d she said. \u201cParliament has not been prorogued.\u201d", "description": "In a major blow to the prime minister, the court ruled unanimously that Parliament is still in session.
