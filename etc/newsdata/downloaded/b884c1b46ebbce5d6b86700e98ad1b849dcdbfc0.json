Some of the photos showed Hill with the campaign staff member.\n\nHer decision also came after the House Ethics Committee last week opened an investigation of the Democratic freshman from California amid separate allegations she had an improper relationship with a congressional staffer. Hill had denied that accusation.\n\n\u201cFor the mistakes made along the way and the people who have been hurt, I am so sorry, and I am learning -- I am not a perfect person and never pretended to be, \u201d Hill, 32, said in a letter announcing her resignation posted Sunday on Twitter.\n\n\u2018Revenge Porn\u2019\n\nHill said private photos of personal moments were \u201cweaponized\u201d against her amid an ongoing divorce, adding that as long as she\u2019s in Congress, \u201cwe\u2019ll live fearful of what might come next and how much it will hurt.\u201d\n\nShe said the posting of her private photos was illegal and that she\u2019s pursuing legal options. California has one of the strongest \u201crevenge porn\u201d laws in the U.S. against posting explicit photos of individuals without their consent.\n\nHill, the first openly bisexual person elected to Congress from California, was seen as a rising star among House Democrats.\n\nDespite her freshman status, she was named to be a member of the House Oversight Committee, one of the panels investigating President Donald Trump\u2019s conduct in office and leading the impeachment process. She also assumed a leadership role in the freshman class of House Democrats and joined the whip team, which is responsible for counting votes.\n\nHer departure will open up a swing district in the U.S. House that Democrats will have to defend. Republicans had held her Southern California seat -- which includes part of Los Angeles County and part of eastern Ventura County -- for 15 years before she won it in 2018, ousting Republican Representative Steve Knight.\n\nHill swept into Congress as part of the wave that flipped the House majority to the Democratic Party. Democrats gained a net total of 41 House seats in the 2018 midterm election.\n\nKyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia, said on Twitter that in a special election to replace Hill the California 25th district would be considered \u201cLeans Democratic\u201d to start, against an earlier \u201cLikely Democratic.\u201d\n\n(Updates with likely special election rating in final paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Billy House.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Derek Wallbank in Singapore at dwallbank@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Chua Baizhen at bchua14@bloomberg.net, Mark Niquette, Ros Krasny\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Democratic Representative Katie Hill, who\u2019s apologized for an \u201cinappropriate\u201d sexual relationship with a female campaign staffer, announced her resignation from Congress, saying in a statement she was departing with a \u201cbroken heart.\u201dThe conservative blog RedState and some news websites", "authors": ["Derek Wallbank"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zCPqHpH96MqT79Z4FNk8zQ--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/5c996fca35ace455841637a26b4b457e", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
