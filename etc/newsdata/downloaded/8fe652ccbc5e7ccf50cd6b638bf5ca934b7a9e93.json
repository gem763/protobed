Something eventually had to give. There was a serious case to be made for pulling out.\n\nBut not like this.\n\nThe acute shame of the moment was captured in two reports this week. The first was a video of a Russian-speaking reporter wandering through a hurriedly abandoned American base in northern Syria, rummaging among the Coca-Cola cans and footballs. The second arrived with news that two United States Air Force F-15 jets had destroyed an American munitions bunker in Syria to prevent munitions and other equipment from falling into the hands of other armed groups.", "description": "The Turkish president got what he wanted \u2014 as did Russia and Iran.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/17/opinion/17syriaWeb/17syriaWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
