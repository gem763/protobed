He has been accused of attacking two men outside a bar in his home country\n\nThe late-night incidents are alleged to have happened the day before South Africa's World Cup squad was announced.\n\nEtzebeth, who won his 81st cap today playing for South Africa against Italy today, denies the allegations him and insists he never attacked anyone or used any racial slurs.\n\nHe said in a statement after the allegations surfaced that it was 'completely untrue and unfounded to claim that I physically or racially abused anyone \u2026 multiple witnesses can corroborate that'.\n\nLawyer Mr Samuels said: 'The investigating officer told me that they are still awaiting the DNA reports to confirm if there is any other DNA on the firearm other than that of Etzebeth.\n\n'So if there is any other DNA on the gun than that of Etzebeth's then the police will take DNA swabs from my clients and will match them up to see if their DNA is on his gun.\n\n'One of my clients says he was pistol whipped twice by Etzebeth which left him with two head wounds and the other says he was pistol whipped once and had one head wound.\n\n'This is what they both say in their affadavits which make up the police docket.'\n\nEtzebeth, 27, was picked by South Africa to play in the vital game against Italy today in the Rugby World Cup in Japan despite facing calls for him to be sent back home to face trial.\n\nEben Etzebeth during the warm up ahead of the World Cup game in Fukuroi against Italy today (left) and (right) Enver Wilsnach who claims he was attacked by the lock forward\n\nThe 6ft 8in tall and 19 stone second row has been in hot water since being accused of racial and physical assault by beating the two men with his gun and calling them a derogatory name.\n\nUnder pressure Springbok Etzebeth who is the cornerstone of the South African scrum and line out responded to the allegations on his Facebook page by totally denying any wrongdoing.\n\nThe powerhouse rugby star wrote: 'It is completely untrue and unfounded to claim that I physically or racially abused anyone in Langebaan as has been reported on social media.\n\n'Multiple witnesses can corroborate that. I am and will always strive to be a true ambassador to this beautiful rainbow nation and the sport of rugby that I love' he said.\n\nLocal men Enver Wilsnach, 42, and Shiyaad Smith, 21, have both laid charges with the police that Etzebeth assaulted them by striking them in the face with a firearm after a night out.\n\nMr Wilsnach told News24: 'I was a fan of his and I am disappointed in him.

He plays for the Springboks. What happened changed the way I see him'.\n\nFollowing legal advice both alleged victims would say no more in case it jeopardised their case against the star.\n\nEtzebeth had been out drinking with his brother and a cousin and a group of friends on the night before the Springbok team was officially announced by SA coach Rassie Erasmus.\n\nThey were drinking in a popular seaside pub and sports bar called Die Watergat in the resort of Langebaan on the west coast some 80 miles north of Cape Town and left at 2am.\n\nIt is said that an ugly confrontation then broke out between Etzebeth's group and locals.\n\nThe two men Mr Wilsnach and Mr Smith alleged Etzebeth used the word 'hotnots' which is a derivative of Hottentot which is a historical description of the original indigenous people.\n\nEben Etzebeth played against Italy in Fukuro today (pictured) despite calls for him to be sent home from the World Cup in Japan over allegations he assaulted two men\n\nThey claim that the word is a racial slur and as insulting as the 'K' word is to black people, similar to the 'N' word in Britain and the US.\n\nThe Springbok lock met with the South African Human Rights Commission with his lawyers following the alleged assault at the end of August before the squad flew to Japan.\n\nSA Rugby Chief Executive Officer Mr Jurie Roux told the media that if the allegations were found to be true then Etzebeth would have to withdraw from the squad and fly home.\n\nHe is also said to have told Etzebeth if he lied about not having racially abused or assaulted the two men then he would never wear the green and gold shirt of the Springboks again.\n\nPolice spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexan confirmed the assault case was active and the docket had been sent to the National Prosecuting Authority to make a charging decision.\n\nLawyer Nigel Samuels is representing two men who claim they were attacked by Eben Etzebeth\n\nThe South African Human Rights Commission is taking the matter to the Equality Court today to see if it will her what amounts to a civil case and ask for a date for it to be heard.\n\nThe case can be brought even if the National Prosecuting Authority does not bring a criminal case and if it finds against Etzebeth its punishment results in fines or community service.\n\nLawyer for the two alleged victims Mr Samuels said that there was already enough evidence in the original docket sent to the NPA and was disappointed they had asked for more.\n\nHe said: 'The NPA want more but I believe there is already enough evidence for a prima facie case to answer and it is not the NPA's job to decide if he is guilty or not but to establish if there is a case.\n\n'A court of law would decide if he is guilty or not and I am confident there is enough evidence for a prima facie case already and in a perfect world Etzebeth should be brought home to face trial.'\n\nThe allegations came after Yorayda Papier-Jansen posted on her social media that her friend had been 'brutally' attacked by Etzebeth, his brother Ryen and their group of friends.\n\nShe accused the group of pointing a gun, swearing at them and using foul language and shouting at them in Afrikaans: 'Hotnots, what are you still doing out on the streets.'\n\nEtzebeth denies any wrongdoing and says he did not racially abuse or attack the two men outside a bar in his home country\n\nThe friend who had been walking Yorayda and her cousin home is shown on the post lying on the floor unconscious, battered and bloodied outside the Die Watergat sports bar.\n\nYorayda said on her post: 'Brutally attack while walking me and my Couzens home by Eben Edzebet, [sic] Ryen, Emile and friends calling us hotnots and swearing, this is not on.\n\n'Gun pointing innocent people and assaulting a poor innocent man who has done absolutely nothing wrong to u. Eben Edzebet [sic] u the biggest racist coz how can u ask Hotnots was suk julle nog op [sic] start and yet you a public figure?'\n\nSA Rugby said in a statement they would co-operate with the authorities in investigating the incident but said he would remain a part of their World Cup team until told otherwise.\n\nEtzebeth will play for French rugby team Toulon after the World Cup having been signed from Cape Town team Stormers on a mega \u00a31m a year deal.", "description": "Attorney Nigel Samuels revealed that South African police seized the firearm of rugby star Eben Etzebeth and sent it to be DNA tested at a laboratory.
