MICHIGAN STATE\n\nMichigan State has all the pieces to go out and win a national championship this year. They have shooting. They have size. They have talented veterans in starting roles with promising younger pieces ready to push them for minutes. They have a Hall Of Famer running the show in Tom Izzo. And I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention the fact that they have this kid who just so happens to be the best player in college basketball this season. Cassius Winston, ever heard of him?\n\nIf there are concerns here, it\u2019s that the Spartans are a little bit thin up front. Xavier Tillman is ready to take over the five-spot in a full-time role with Nick Ward gone, but the bigs behind him are young. Will Marcus Bingham be ready to play 20 minutes a night? What will be more interesting to see is if Izzo goes full small-ball. With Aaron Henry, Gabe Brown and Malik Hall on the roster, he has the bodies to do it, especially if Marquette transfer Joey Hauser finds a way to get a waiver from the NCAA.\n\n2. KENTUCKY\n\nStory continues\n\nWHO\u2019S GONE : P.J. Washington, Keldon Johnson, Tyler Herro, Reid Travis\n\nWHO\u2019S BACK : E.J. Montgomery, Ashton Hagans, Immanuel Quickly, Nick Richards\n\nWHO\u2019S COMING IN : Kahlil Whitney, Tyrese Maxey, Keion Brooks, Johnny Juzang, Dontaie Allen, Nate Sestina\n\nPROJECTED STARTERS: Tyrese Maxey, Ashton Hagans, Kahlil Whitney, Keion Brooks, E.J. Montgomery\n\nSurprise, surprise: Kentucky is loaded again, especially in the backcourt. Ashton Hagans returns for his sophomore season where he will be joined by Tyrese Maxey in what may end up being the toughest, most competitive and best defensive backcourt in college basketball. Immanuel Quickly, Kahlil Whitney, Johnny Juzang and Keion Brooks will give John Calipari more than enough weapons to keep defenses guessing on the perimeter; those practice battles to earn playing time are going to be fun to watch.\n\nThe big question mark is going to be in Kentucky\u2019s frontcourt, where E.J. Montgomery will look to take a P.J. Washington-esque step forward and Nick Richards will, hopefully, live up to his five-star potential. The addition of grad transfer Nate Sestina from Bucknell will provide some depth and experience where the Wildcats really need it. It will be interesting to see if Coach Cal makes the decision to play small this year, because he certainly has the roster to do it.\n\n3. KANSAS\n\nWHO\u2019S GONE : Lagerald Vick, Dedric Lawson, Quintin Grimes, K.J. Lawson, Charlie Moore\n\nWHO\u2019S BACK : Devon Dotson, Ochai Agbaji, Udoka Azubuike, Marcus Garrett, Silvio De Sousa, Mitch Lightfoot, David McCormack\n\nWHO\u2019S COMING IN : Isaiah Moss, Jalen Wilson, Tristan Enaruna, Christian Braun\n\nPROJECTED STARTERS: Devon Dotson, Isaiah Moss, Ochai Agbaji, Silvio De Sousa, Udoka Azubuike\n\nThe NCAA investigation into Kansas and the possible ramifications of the Notice of Allegations that the university received last week will hang over the Jayhawks\u2019 head all season long. That\u2019s a given.\n\nAnd with the understanding that this off-the-court stuff is something that Kansas is going to have to deal with all season long, let\u2019s talk about what is actually happening on the court, because Kansas is going to be fascinating next season. The Jayhawks may have the best center in the country in Udoka Azubuike. At the very least, he\u2019s the best low-post scorer in college hoops. They have one of the best point guards in Devon Dotson. They have one of college basketball\u2019s breakout stars in Ochai Agbaji headlining a plethora of quality wing pieces \u2013 Marcus Garrett, Isaiah Moss, Tristan Enaruna, Jalen Wilson. They have more frontcourt depth than just about anyone else, with Silvio De Sousa, David McCormack and Mitch Lightfoot all fighting for minutes up front.\n\nThe big question is going to be what the Jayhawks do at the four. Dedric Lawson is the perfect player to slot in there, but he\u2019s gone. In his stead, they have \u2026 well, I\u2019m not really sure. They can play two bigs, but that will obliterate their spacing. The same can be said if Garrett slots in at the four. Agbaji would make some sense, but I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s capable of guarding college fours the way that someone like Josh Jackson was. There is no easy answer, which means that Self will have his work cut out for him.\n\n4. LOUISVILLE\n\nWHO\u2019S GONE : Christen Cunningham, Khwan Fore, Akoy Agau\n\nWHO\u2019S BACK : Jordan Nwora, Dwayne Sutton, Ryan McMahon, Steve Enoch, Malik Williams, Darius Perry\n\nWHO\u2019S COMING IN : Samuell Williamson, Jaelyn Withers, Josh Nickelberry, Fresh Kimble, David Johnson, Aidan Igiehom, Quinn Slazinski\n\nPROJECTED STARTERS: Fresh Kimble, Samuell Williamson, Dwayne Sutton, Jordan Nwora, Steve Enoch\n\nThe big news for Louisville is that they bring back Jordan Nwora, who looks to be the favorite to win the ACC Player of the Year award heading into the season. They also get back Dwayne Sutton, and Malik Williams, and Steve Enoch, and add a recruiting class that is exactly what you would expect someone like Chris Mack to bring into a program like Louisville. They have everything that you would expect out of a top five team \u2026\n\n\u2026 except clarity at the point guard spot.\n\nThere are options there. Darius Perry returns from last year\u2019s team. Fresh Kimble, a grad transfer from St. Joseph\u2019s, joins the program, as does four-star freshman David Johnson, who is dealing with a shoulder injury that could keep him out at the start of the season. Someone is going to have to win the starting job. Will they be good enough to carry the Cardinals to the top of the ACC?\n\n5. VILLANOVA\n\nWHO\u2019S GONE : Eric Paschall, Phil Booth, Jahvon Quinerly\n\nWHO\u2019S BACK : Jermaine Samuels, Cole Swider, Saddiq Bey, Collin Gillespie, Dhamir Cosby-Rountree, Brandon Slater\n\nWHO\u2019S COMING IN : Bryan Antoine, Jeremiah Robinson-Earl, Justin Moore, Eric Dixon\n\nPROJECTED STARTERS: Collin Gillespie, Bryan Antoine, Saddiq Bey, Jermaine Samuels, Jeremiah Robinson-Earl\n\nMaybe I\u2019m overvaluing Villanova again because they\u2019re Villanova, but I am quite bullish on them once again. I think the Saddiq Bey and Jermaine Samuels are both in line for big seasons, and when combined with Bryan Antoine \u2013 who will hopefully be healthy by December \u2013 give Jay Wright three wings that fit perfectly with the way that he wants to play. Collin Gillispie isn\u2019t Jalen Brunson, but not very many people are Jalen Brunson, so that\u2019s a concern, but I think that he\u2019ll be serviceable in the Big East this season.\n\nAnd then there is all the young talent on the roster. Cole Swider should take a significant step forward as a sophomore. Jeremiah Robinson-Earl is a five-star recruit. Brandon Slater should be ready for a bigger role. The big concern here is that this team is still going to be very, very young for a Villanova team. We might still be a year away with this group.\n\n6. DUKE\n\nWHO\u2019S GONE : Zion Williamson, R.J. Barrett, Cam Reddish, Marques Bolden\n\nWHO\u2019S BACK : Tre Jones, Alex O\u2019Connell, Jack White, Javin DeLaurier, Jordan Goldwire, Joey Baker\n\nWHO\u2019S COMING IN : Vernon Carey, Wendell Moore, Matthew Hurt, Cassius Stanley\n\nPROJECTED STARTERS: Tre Jones, Alex O\u2019Connell, Wendell Moore, Matthew Hurt, Vernon Carey\n\nThis Duke roster is weird. Talented, but weird.\n\nI like a lot of the pieces here. Vernon Carey is going to be a very good college basketball player. Same with Matthew Hurt. Wendell Moore should be able to impact the game on the defensive end of the floor from day one. Javin DeLaurier is a very useful role player, while the likes of Alex O\u2019Connell, Jack White, Joey Baker and Jordan Goldwire will all be a year older this season.\n\nThe problem is that Duke doesn\u2019t have very many lineups that they can play that will be good defensively and be able to create enough space for Carey to operate in the lane. That\u2019s where Tre Jones comes into play. We wrote all about Mr. Jones and why his ability to shoot will be the most influential skill for any player in college basketball next season right here.\n\n7. FLORIDA\n\nWHO\u2019S GONE : KeVaughn Allen, Jalen Hudson, Kevarrius Hayes, Keith Stone, DeAundre Ballard\n\nWHO\u2019S BACK : Noah Locke, Andrew Nembhard, Keyontae Johnson, Dontay Bassett, Isaiah Stokes\n\nWHO\u2019S COMING IN : Kerry Blackshear Jr., Scottie Lewis, Tre Mann, Omar Payne, Jason Jitoboh\n\nPROJECTED STARTERS: Andrew Nembhard, Noah Locke, Scottie Lewis, Keyontae Johnson, Kerry Blackshear Jr.\n\nThe outlook for Florida\u2019s season changed dramatically when they landed a commitment from Kerry Blackshear Jr., the Virginia Tech grad transfer that picked the Gators over Tennessee and Kentucky. He is an All-American talent that will anchor the frontcourt for a team that has all the perimeter depth you would want.\n\nIt starts with Andrew Nembhard, who is going to have a big sophomore season and will pair with Tre Mann to handle Florida\u2019s point guard duties. Scottie Lewis is going to be one of the best perimeter defenders in the sport next season, while Noah Locke and Keyontae Johnson are back to round out Florida\u2019s rotation.\n\n8. GONZAGA\n\nWHO\u2019S GONE : Rui Hachimura, Brandon Clarke, Josh Perkins, Zach Norvell, Geno Crandall, Jeremy Jones\n\nWHO\u2019S BACK : Killian Tillie, Filip Petrusev, Corey Kispert\n\nWHO\u2019S COMING IN : Admon Gilder, Drew Timme, Oumar Ballo, Ryan Woolridge, Brock Ravet, Anton Watson, Martynas Arlauskas, Pavel Zahkarov\n\nPROJECTED STARTERS: Ryan Woolridge, Admon Gilder, Corey Kispert, Killian Tillie, Filip Petrusev\n\nMark Few lost quite a bit off of last season\u2019s roster, and there are more than a few questions about just who this team is going to be able to trust this season, but there is more than enough talent here for the Zags to once again make a run at being a top ten team.\n\nKillian Tillie is back and healthy. Corey Kispert is a talent that has been waiting for more opportunity in Spokane. Filip Petrusev will finally be able to anchor the frontcourt on his own, while the likes of Drew Timme and Oumar Ballo are promising freshman that are going to push for minutes immediately. The big question is going to be in the backcourt, where a pair of grad transfers \u2013 Ryan Woolridge and Admon Gilder \u2013 are going to take the reins with a freshman \u2013 Brock Ravet \u2013 providing depth. All three are new to the program, and it\u2019s never ideal to head into a season with such inexperience at the point guard spot.\n\n9. MARYLAND\n\nWHO\u2019S GONE : Bruno Fernando\n\nWHO\u2019S BACK : Anthony Cowan, Jalen Smith, Serrel Smith Jr., Eric Ayala, Aaron Wiggins, Ricky Lindo, Darryl Morsell\n\nWHO\u2019S COMING IN : Chol Marial, Makhi Mitchell, Makhel Mitchell, Donta Scott\n\nPROJECTED STARTERS: Anthony Cowan, Eric Ayala, Aaron Wiggins, Ricky Lindo, Jalen Smith\n\nThere is nothing riskier than going all-in on a team coached by Mark Turgeon, but here we are. Losing Bruno Fernando hurts, but the Terps not only got Jalen Smith back, they also return Anthony Cowan. That could end up being the best 1-2 punch in the Big Ten this side of Michigan State.\n\nWhat\u2019s more promising is that the Terps have a loaded sophomore class. Smith is the name you know, but Eric Ayala, Aaron Wiggins and Ricky Lindo all had promising rookie campaigns, while the likes of Darryl Morsell and the Mitchell twins give Turgeon plenty of depth.\n\n10. VIRGINIA\n\nWHO\u2019S GONE : De\u2019Andre Hunter, Ty Jerome, Kyle Guy, Jack Salt\n\nWHO\u2019S BACK : Braxton Key, Mamadi Diakite, Jay Huff, Kihei Clark\n\nWHO\u2019S COMING IN : Casey Morsell, Tomas Woldetensae, Kadin Shedrick, Justin McKoy\n\nPROJECTED STARTERS: Kihei Clark, Casey Morsell, Braxton Key, Mamadi Diakite, Jay Huff\n\nI am a Tony Bennett stan, and I fully believe that the combination of Mamadi Diakite and Jay Huff is the kind of malleable, versatile and talented frontcourt that will allow Bennett to flex his X\u2019s-and-O\u2019s muscles and get creative offensively, but I fully admit that putting Virginia in the top ten is likely beyond the top of their range.\n\nThey lost De\u2019Andre Hunter. They lost Ty Jerome. They lost Kyle Guy. That\u2019s a lot to lose, especially when Virginia was not planning on losing the latter two for another year. Will Casey Morsell be ready at the start of the season? Is Kihei Clark going to be able to handle the lead guard role in a ball-screen heavy offense? Just how good is Braxton Key going to be as a senior?\n\nI don\u2019t really have answers. But I\u2019m willing to bet on Bennett figuring those answers out.\n\n11. TEXAS TECH\n\nWHO\u2019S GONE : Jarrett Culver, Matt Mooney, Tariq Owens, Brandone Francis, Norense Odiase, Khavon Moore\n\nWHO\u2019S BACK : Chris Beard, Davide Moretti, Kyler Edwards, Andrei Savrasov\n\nWHO\u2019S COMING IN : Jahmius Ramsey, Chris Clarke, T.J. Holyfield, Kevin McCullar, Russel Tchewa, Terrence Shannon\n\nPROJECTED STARTERS: Jahmius Ramsey, Davide Moretti, Kyler Edwards, T.J. Holyfield, Chris Clarke\n\nThe Red Raiders only return two players from last year\u2019s national runner-up: Davide Moretti and Kyler Edwards. But there is no one in college basketball that has proven to be better at finding a way to entirely remake a roster year after year that Chris Beard. Jahmius Ramsey is going to be one of the most productive freshman in all of college basketball this season \u2013 he is a perfect fit for Beard\u2019s style of play \u2013 and the addition of grad transfers Chris Clarke and T.J. Holyfield will help as well. Like Virginia, I\u2019m not really sure how, exactly, it\u2019s going to happen, but I fully believe that Tech is going to end up being right there in the mix at the top of the Big 12 once again this season.\n\n12. OREGON\n\nWHO\u2019S GONE : Paul White, Louis King, Ehab Amin, Kenny Wooten, Bol Bol, Victor Bailey\n\nWHO\u2019S BACK : Payton Pritchard, Will Richardson, Francis Okoro\n\nWHO\u2019S COMING IN : N\u2019Faly Dante, C.J. Walker, Anthony Mathis, Shakur Juiston, Addison Patterson, Chris Duarte, Lok Wur, Chandler Lawson\n\nPROJECTED STARTERS: Payton Pritchard, Chris Duarte, Anthony Mathis, C.J. Walker, Shakur Juiston\n\nThe Ducks are the toughest team for me in these rankings. On the one hand, they lost oh-so-very-much from last season. On the other hand, Payton Pritchard is back, as is Will Richardson, and they will be joined by a rebuilt roster with quite a bit of interesting talent: Freshmen N\u2019Faly Dante, C.J. Walker, Addison Patterson and Chandler Lawson; transfers Shakur Juiston, Anthony Mathis and Chris Duarte. Throw in Francis Okoro, and there are enough pieces here for Dana Altman to have fun figuring things out.\n\n13. SETON HALL\n\nWHO\u2019S GONE : Michael Nzei\n\nWHO\u2019S BACK : Myles Powell, Myles Cale, Quincy McKnight, Sandro Mamukelashvili, Ikey Obiagu\n\nWHO\u2019S COMING IN : Tyrese Samuel\n\nPROJECTED STARTERS: Quincy McKnight, Myles Powell, Myles Cale, Sandro Mamukelashvili, Ikey Obiagu\n\nThere\u2019s an argument to be made that Seton Hall is going to be the best team in the Big East next season. This is essentially the same roster that Seton Hall had last season, which matters because Myles Powell returns for his senior season. He is one of the most dangerous scorers in all of college hoops. He is going to be an All-American. He\u2019s awesome. He also has a solid supporting cast, with Myles Cale, Quincy McKnight and Sandro Mamukelashvili all back. Their ceiling will likely be determined by how good Jared Rhoden and Ike Obiagu end up being this season.\n\n14. NORTH CAROLINA\n\nWHO\u2019S GONE : Coby White, Nassir Little, Luke Maye, Cam Johnson, Kenny Williams, Seventh Woods\n\nWHO\u2019S BACK : Leaky Black, Garrison Brooks, Brandon Robinson\n\nWHO\u2019S COMING IN : Cole Anthony, Armando Bacot, Jeremiah Francis, Anthony Harris, Christian Keeling, Justin Pierce\n\nPROJECTED STARTERS: Cole Anthony, Christian Keeling, Leaky Black, Armando Bacot, Garrison Brooks\n\nCole Anthony is going to be the most productive freshman in college basketball this season. He\u2019s a terrific athlete, a high-volume scorer and the kind of uber-competitive lead guard that will make North Carolina fans forget about Coby White fairly quickly. The problem for the Heels is that White isn\u2019t the only guy they lost. Luke Maye, Nassir Little, Cam Johnson and Kenny Williams are all gone as well. I think Armando Bacot is going to be very, very good for UNC in the long term, and adding a pair of grad transfers in Justin Pierce and Christian Keeling will certainly help, but there is going to be a learning curve early on for this group.\n\n15. UTAH STATE\n\nWHO\u2019S GONE : Quinn Taylor\n\nWHO\u2019S BACK : Sam Merrill, Neemias Queta, Diogo Brito, Brock Miller, Abel Porter\n\nWHO\u2019S COMING IN : Alphonso Anderson, Liam McChesney, Sean Bairstow\n\nPROJECTED STARTERS: Diogo Brito, Abel Porter, Sam Merrill, Brock Miller, Neemias Queta\n\nOnce we got word that the knee injury suffered by star center Neemias Queta in the FIBA U20 Euros was not serious, we knew that Craig Smith and this Utah State team would be the best in the Mountain West and arguably the best outside the power conferences. Queta is one reason why. Sam Merrill, who might play his way onto All-America teams by the time March roles around, is probably a bigger reason why. All told, the Aggies bring back five of their top six from last season. They are going to be dangerous.\n\n16. ARIZONA\n\nWHO\u2019S GONE : Justin Coleman, Ryan Luther, Brandon Randolph\n\nWHO\u2019S BACK : Dylan Smith, Chase Jeter, Brandon Williams, Alex Barcello, Ira Lee\n\nWHO\u2019S COMING IN : Nico Mannion, Josh Green, Max Hazzard, Christian Koloko, Zeke Nnaji, Stone Gettings\n\nPROJECTED STARTERS: Max Hazzard, Nico Mannion, Josh Green, Ira Lee, Chase Jeter\n\nWith everything going on around the program, it\u2019s hard to believe that this team will be fighting with Oregon and Washington for Pac-12 supremacy. Nico Mannion and Josh Green, a pair of five-star freshman, are the headliners, and their jobs will be all-the-more important with Brandon Williams out due to a knee injury. UC Irvine transfer Max Hazzard should provide some experience and depth, but the key is going to be how Sean Miller handles his frontcourt. Can Chase Jeter be trusted? Is Zeke Nnaji going to live up to the preseason hype? How good is Ira Lee?\n\n17. SAINT MARY\u2019S\n\nWHO\u2019S GONE : Jordan Hunter\n\nWHO\u2019S BACK : Jordan Ford, Malik Fitts, Tommy Kuhse, Tanner Krebs, Dan Fotu, Jock Perry\n\nWHO\u2019S COMING IN : Aaron Menzies, Alex Ducas, Kyle Bowen\n\nPROJECTED STARTERS: Jordan Ford, Tommy Kuhse, Tanner Krebs, Malik Fitts, Jock Perry\n\nThe Gaels have been to just two of the last six NCAA tournaments, but this looks like a season where they are going to get back. Jordan Ford is going to be this year\u2019s mid-major star to know, while Malik Fitts is the kind of athletic and versatile small-ball four that will allow SMC to matchup with power conference programs. Throw in the return of Tommy Kuhse and Tanner Krebs as well as the addition of 7-foot-3 center Aaron Menzies, Randy Bennett has himself a squad.\n\n18. XAVIER\n\nWHO\u2019S GONE : Ryan Welage, Zach Hankins, Kyle Castlin, Elias Harden\n\nWHO\u2019S BACK : Quentin Goodin, Naji Marshall, Paul Scruggs, Tyrique Jones\n\nWHO\u2019S COMING IN : Kyky Tandy, Dahmir Bishop, Zach Freemantle, Jason Carter, Daniel Ramsey, Dieonte Miles\n\nPROJECTED STARTERS: Quentin Goodin, Paul Scruggs, Naji Marshall, Jason Carter, Tyrique Jones\n\nThe Musketeers are better than people realize. After a strong finish to last season, Travis Steele returns four starters, including potential breakout star Naji Marshall. Quentin Goodin, Paul Scruggs and Tyrique Jones are all back as well, and with the arrival of recruiting class that includes five four-star players and a pair of immediately eligible transfers, Xavier has the look of a team that is going to make a run at the top of the Big East.\n\n19. LSU\n\nWHO\u2019S GONE : Tremont Waters, Naz Reid, Kavell-Bigby Williams\n\nWHO\u2019S BACK : Javonte Smart, Skylar Mays, Emmitt Williams, Marlon Taylor, Darius Days\n\nWHO\u2019S COMING IN : Trendon Watford, James Bishop\n\nPROJECTED STARTERS: Javonte Smart, Skylar Mays, Marlon Taylor, Trendon Watford, Emmitt Williams\n\nLSU looked like they could be one of the worst teams in the SEC heading into this year. Then the school decided not to fire Will Wade. Then Javonte Smart, Skylar Mays, Emmitt Williams and Marlon Taylor all decided to return to schol. Then Trendon Watford committed. Wade has done more with less. The x-factor is going to be when the NCAA drops their Notice of Allegations.\n\n20. BAYLOR\n\nWHO\u2019S GONE : King McClure, Makai Mason, Jake Lindsey\n\nWHO\u2019S BACK : Tristan Clark, Jared Butler, Devonte Bandoo, Mark Vital, Freddie Gillespie, Matthew Mayer\n\nWHO\u2019S COMING IN : Jordan Turner, MaCio Teague, Davion Mitchell\n\nPROJECTED STARTERS: Davion Mitchell, Jared Butler, Mark Vital, MaCio Teague, Tristan Clark\n\nI\u2019ll be honest: I think I might actually have Baylor too low here. The Bears finished in the top half of the Big 12 last season despite missing Tristan Clark for all of league play. Now he\u2019s back, as is the majority of their key pieces: Mark Vital, Devonte Bandoo. Throw in Davion Mitchell and Macio Teague, a pair of talented transfers, and freshman Jordan Turner, and Scott Drew might have his deepest team in Waco. He finds a way to get it done with guys that don\u2019t really matter. It\u2019s going to be interesting to see what he can do now that he has a roster that\u2019s good enough to give the Bears some level of expectation.\n\n21. MEMPHIS\n\nWHO\u2019S GONE : Jeremiah Martin, Kyvon Davenport, Mike Parks Jr., Raynere Thornton, Kareem Brewton, Antwann Jones Jr.\n\nWHO\u2019S BACK : Tyler Harris, Alex Lomax, Isaiah Maurice\n\nWHO\u2019S COMING IN : James Wiseman, D.J. Jeffries, Lester Quinones, Malcolm Dandridge, Damian Baugh, Lance Thomas, Precious Achiuwa, Boogie Ellis\n\nPROJECTED STARTERS: Tyler Harris, Boogie Ellis, D.J. Jeffries, Precious Achiuwa, James Wiseman\n\nI am lower than consensus on Memphis. I explained why here.\n\n22. AUBURN\n\nWHO\u2019S GONE : Jared Harper, Bryce Brown, Malik Dunbar, Horace Spencer, Chuma Okeke\n\nWHO\u2019S BACK : Samir Doughty, J\u2019Von McCormick, Danjel Purifoy, Anfernee McLemore, Austin Wiley\n\nWHO\u2019S COMING IN : Isaac Okoro, Tyrell Jones, Jaylin Williams, Babatunde Akingbola, Allen Flanigan, Jamal Johnson\n\nPROJECTED STARTERS: J\u2019Von McCormick, Samir Doughty, Danjel Purifoy, Isaac Okoro, Anfernee McLemore\n\nLosing Chuma Okeke early to the draft hurts, but that was expect. Losing Jared Harper? That hurt more. The good news is J\u2019Von McCormick showed flashes of being ready to take over for Harper, and it looks like Isaac Okoro is going to be able to do some of the things that made Okeke so good for Auburn. There are going to be some growing pains, but there is enough talent here for the Tigers to be relevant in the SEC.\n\n23. TENNESSEE\n\nWHO\u2019S GONE : Admiral Schofield, Kyle Alexander, Jordan Bone, Grant Williams, Derrick Walker Jr, D.J. Burns\n\nWHO\u2019S BACK : Lamonte Turner, Jordan Bowden, Yves Pons, John Fulkerson, Jalen Johnson\n\nWHO\u2019S COMING IN : Josiah James, Drew Pember, Olivier Nkamoua, Davonte Gaines\n\nPROJECTED STARTERS: Lamonte Turner, Jordan Bowden, Josiah James, Yves Pons, John Fulkerson\n\nMissing out on Kerry Blackshear really hurt, because the Vols have everything other than a big man. Lamonte Turner should be able to make Tennessee fans forget Jordan Bone left early. Josiah James should have an immediate and significant impact as a freshman. There\u2019s a lot to like about Jordan Bowden, too. But not having that rock to anchor the offense, a guy to fill the Grant Williams role, is why Tennessee is at the back end of the top 25.\n\n24. VCU\n\nWHO\u2019S GONE : Michael Gilmore\n\nWHO\u2019S BACK : Marcus Evans, Isaac Vann, Deriante Jenkins, Marcus Santos-Silva, Vince Williams, Mike\u2019L Simms, P.J. Byrd, Malik Crawford\n\nWHO\u2019S COMING IN : Jarren McAlister, Tre Clark, Hason Ward, Nah\u2019Shon Hyland\n\nPROJECTED STARTERS: Marcus Evans, Isaac Vann, Vince Williams, Deriante Jenkins, Marcus Santos-Silva\n\nThe Rams being essentially everyone back from a 25-win team that went 16-2 in the Atlantic 10 last season, finished the year ranked seventh in KenPom\u2019s adjusted defensive efficiency metric and adds an impressive recruiting class. Perhaps most important \u2013 Marcus Evans has had a full offseason to get himself healthy. Look out for the Rams.\n\n25. OHIO STATE\n\nWHO\u2019S GONE : C.J. Jackson, Keyshawn Woods\n\nWHO\u2019S BACK : Kaleb Wesson, Andre Wesson, Luther Muhammad, Duane Washington, Kyle Young, Justin Aherns, Musa Jallow, Jaedon LeDee\n\nWHO\u2019S COMING IN : D.J. Carton, Alonzo Gaffney, EJ Liddel, Ibrahima Diallo, CJ Walker\n\nPROJECTED STARTERS: C.J. Walker, Duane Washington Jr., Luther Muhammad, Andre Wesson, Kaleb Wesson\n\nI might be too low on the Buckeyes.
