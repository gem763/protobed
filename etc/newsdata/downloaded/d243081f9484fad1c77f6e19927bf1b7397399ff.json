You have to be direct about the fact that there are certain consequences of it that will affect people differently. The more you can be transparent about it, I think it\u2019s important,\u201d said Sen. Ben Cardin Benjamin (Ben) Louis CardinDemocrats vow to push for repeal of other Trump rules after loss on power plant rollback Senate Democrats aim to repeal rules blocking Trump tax law workarounds Congress briefed on Iran after Saudi oil attacks MORE (D-Md.), who has not endorsed a candidate for president.\n\nCardin acknowledged that \u201ctaxes are sort of a toxic word\u201d but argued that Warren and other candidates who back Medicare for All would be doing themselves a favor by leveling with voters.\n\n\u201cI think you have to be transparent. I think the more you try to be cute, the more it hurts you with voters,\u201d he said, noting that Warren\u2019s rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersSanders seeks spark from Ocasio-Cortez at Queens rally On The Money: Supreme Court takes up challenge to CFPB | Warren's surge brings scrutiny to wealth tax | Senators eye curbs on Trump emergency powers Biden seeks to fundraise off fact he's running out of money MORE (I-Vt.), who admits that taxes on the middle class will go up, \u201cis much more direct on this.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s support for Medicare for All is popular among liberal voters in the Democratic base but there\u2019s deep skepticism among many Senate Democrats for the plan because of its cost, and because it would jeopardize the nation\u2019s longstanding system of employer-provided health care.\n\nWarren\u2019s presidential rivals see the potential tax hit on middle-class voters as a vulnerability they can exploit to derail her march to the nomination.\n\nSen.

Michael Bennet Michael Farrand BennetThe Hill's Campaign Report: Biden camp faces new challenges Bennet reintroduces bill to ban lawmakers from becoming lobbyists Schumer seeks focus on health care amid impeachment fever MORE (D-Colo.), who is also running for president, expressed exasperation Thursday with Warren\u2019s lack of detail.\n\n\u201cThis is her most important plan, this is her most significant plan and she\u2019s running on Medicare for All and she will not tell the American people how she\u2019ll pay for it,\u201d he said.\n\nWarren was careful at Tuesday\u2019s debate to emphasize her guarantee that total costs for families would go down under her plan. She also promised that wealthy individuals and corporations would carry much of the burden instead.\n\n\u201cCosts will go up for the wealthy, for corporations,\u201d she said Tuesday. \u201cBut for middle-class families, it will go down.\n\nWarren stuck to that description when asked Thursday about pressure from fellow Democratic senators to be more explicit in explaining how she\u2019ll pay for Medicare for All.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made my principles on this clear. I will not sign a bill into law that does not reduce costs for hardworking middle-class families,\u201d she said. \u201cI meet families every time I do a town hall who talk to me about how health care is crushing them financially, even though they have health insurance.\u201d\n\nAsked about criticism that she dodged admitting at the debate that taxes would go up for the middle class, Warren said: \u201cWhat I explicitly said is exactly what I wanted to say. And that is I will not raise costs for hardworking middle-class families.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe attacks on Warren at Tuesday night\u2019s debate highlighted how she increasingly is seen as the front-runner in the race. She has surpassed former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenTrump knocks Romney as 'Democrat secret asset' in new video Giuliani asked State Dept. to grant visa for ex-Ukraine official at center of Biden allegations: report Perry won't comply with subpoena in impeachment inquiry MORE in recent polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, and is among the Democratic leaders in fundraising.\n\nSenate Democrats who back Biden are among those ramping up pressure on Warren over Medicare for all. They contrast Warren\u2019s statements about her plan with Sanders, who backs Medicare for All and says it will require tax hikes.\n\n\u201cSen. Sanders has said it will reduce overall costs for beneficiaries but to pay for it will require raising taxes on virtually everyone,\u201d sad Sen. Chris Coons Christopher (Chris) Andrew CoonsMeet the dog and 'sea turtle' who launched campaigns for office Senators demand briefing on Trump's decision to withdraw from Syria 2020 Democrats push for gun control action at forum MORE (D-Dela.), who has endorsed Biden.\n\n\u201cI respect the transparency that Sen. Sanders is bringing to this.\u201d\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein Dianne Emiel FeinsteinSchiff should consider using RICO framework to organize impeachment We need answers to questions mainstream media won't ask about Democrats The Hill's Morning Report - Trump grapples with Syria fallout MORE (D-Calif.), who has also endorsed Biden, said \u201cany big health plan is obviously costly and how you pay for it is important and people should know.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy own view is that people who can pay for it, should pay for it but if you can\u2019t, you ought to have the government\u2019s help,\u201d she said.\n\nOther Democrats who are concerned about the potential cost of Medicare for All are leery to direct any criticism at Warren.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on any specific candidate\u2019s current proposals,\u201d said Sen. Mark Warner Mark Robert WarnerLawmakers set to host fundraisers focused on Nats' World Series trip The Hill's 12:30 Report: Washington mourns loss of Elijah Cummings Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle mourn Cummings MORE (D-Va.), another member of the Finance Committee. But he did warn that candidates should be mindful of how their plans could grow federal deficits.\n\n\u201cI know there are some theories out there that say that debt and deficit don\u2019t matter anymore, deficits can never cause problems. I don\u2019t think the basic rules of economics have been reversed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have, thank goodness, not paid the price yet of our close to $24 trillion in debt because we\u2019ve had remarkably low interest rates for a long time but I would hate to bet the future of our country on that continuing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t find anything progressive about saddling our kids and our grandkids with a balance sheet that is so far in the red that they\u2019ll never be able to dig their way out,\u201d he said.\n\nCardin, who like the majority of the Senate Democratic caucus does not support Medicare for All, said the plan would require raising taxes substantially because private employers would no longer foot the bill for insuring the majority of the American public.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re doing is you\u2019re transferring \u2026 the responsibility of payment from the private sector, which is employer, employee and individual, to more on the governmental sector. So there are savings on the private sector, there are costs on the government sector. That means there\u2019s going to be need for greater revenue in the public sector,\u201d he said.\n\nOther Democratic senators also argued for transparency.\n\n\u201cI think everyone who\u2019s running for president should talk about their plan, how they plan to implement it and how to plan to pay for it,\u201d said Sen.
