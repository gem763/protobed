On some occasions, we earn revenue if you click the links and book, but we never allow this to affect our coverage.\n\nCraving some winter sun? There\u2019s never been a better time to check out Goa (aka India\u2019s capital of coastal cool), thanks to a spate of recent hotel openings and Virgin Atlantic\u2019s relaunched London to Mumbai flights, which take to the skies at the end of October 2019.\n\nHere are 10 reasons to visit.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThere are fantastic new hotels popping up\n\nYou\u2019ll find the Hilton Goa Resort, which opened in December 2018, perched above the banks of the Nerul River, making it the perfect base if you\u2019re keen to explore beyond Goa\u2019s beaches. We\u2019re also rather smitten with Postcard Resorts\u2019 recently opened Goa hotels \u2013 you\u2019ll find the brand\u2019s three heritage properties well away from the beach, in Moira, Velha and Cuelim.\n\nFor sheer opulence, it\u2019s got to be the Taj Fort Aguada Resort & Spa, close to the ramparts of a 16th-century fort; while guests at Cabo Serai, which opened in mid-2019 in South Goa, can stay in luxurious tents or beautiful cottages. For travellers tempted by the self-catering route, consider Ama Stays & Trails\u2019 two new boutique villas in Candolim.\n\nThere\u2019s a whole other world beyond the beach\n\nA growing number of tourists are realising there\u2019s so much more to Goa than golden beaches, whether it\u2019s Goa\u2019s Unesco-listed churches and convents (the late-Renaissance Church of Bom Jesus, which contains the tomb of St Francis-Xavier, is a favourite) or the colourful chaos of Panaji, the region\u2019s capital. And it\u2019s easier than ever to explore this side of Goa, thanks to tours like the ones offered by b:live, which specialises in e-bike tours of lesser-known destinations such as Divar Island.\n\nIt\u2019s shaping up to be India\u2019s adventure capital\n\nIn August 2018, India unveiled its second bungee jumping site \u2013 55 metres above the shimmering Mayem Lake in North Goa. And there\u2019s no end to the ways in which adrenaline junkies can get their fix. Fancy a spot of parasailing? The best spots are Bogmalo, Calangute, Colva, Majorda and Anjuna. It\u2019s now possible to try flyboarding at Baina Beach, while Majorda and Candolim are two fantastic destinations for windsurfing and kitesurfing. And for further proof that Goa isn\u2019t just about the beach, head to Upper Sauri Canyon \u2013 a popular canyoning spot.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It\u2019s never been easier to explore inland Goa by bike. Several hotels have joined forces with bike-based tour operators: one example is the Hilton Goa Resort, which has linked up with Goa-based bike tour operator b:live to offer guests tours of nearby sights, such as the pretty village of Saipem.\n\nIt\u2019s now even easier to get there\n\nIf you\u2019re heading to Goa from the UK, the quickest route is via Mumbai, and in late October, Virgin Atlantic launched new flights from London. From there it\u2019s just a short hop, and you\u2019ll have a number of brilliant budget airlines to choose from. If you\u2019ve got time to spare, consider taking the train. The journey takes 14 hours but you\u2019ll pass through some of the country\u2019s most beautiful landscapes, including the Western Ghats and mountainous Konkan Region.\n\nThe beaches are looking better than ever\n\nGoa\u2019s litter problem has been widely reported in the past, but the situation\u2019s improving, thanks to regular organised beach clean-ups alongside innovative schemes such as the one recently organised by Drishti Marine, a private beach management agency. The organisation set up a pop-up waste bar, allowing visitors to pick up a free beer or cocktail in exchange for 10 bottle caps, 20 cigarette butts or five used plastic straws. The cleaner, clearer waters have transformed it into one of India\u2019s top diving destinations, and popular spots include Baga Beach, with its rich selection of marine life, and the waters surrounding Grande Island, where you\u2019ll find the submerged wreck of SS Rita, a British cargo ship.\n\nIt\u2019s an important time to show your support\n\nThe collapse of Thomas Cook has hit Goa hard \u2013 it was one of the tour operator\u2019s most popular long-haul destinations. On the plus side, it\u2019s a great time to show your support for the region, because the holiday firm\u2019s collapse means this year\u2019s peak season (from November to February) will inevitably be slightly quieter, meaning fewer crowds and more choice when it comes to accommodation.\n\nYou\u2019ll never go hungry\n\nWashing down ocean-fresh plates of calamari with cheap bottles of Kingfisher is all well and good, but Goa\u2019s culinary scene is evolving at lightning speed. Take Ashvem Beach\u2019s La Plage restaurant, where you can dine on traditional Goan cuisine with a French twist, or the delicious Burmese cuisine on offer at Bomra\u2019s in Candolim. And then there\u2019s Arpora\u2019s Royal Enfield Garage Caf\u00e9 Goa, which is a restaurant and live music venue as well as a motorcycle hire and repair shop. Head here to gorge on a mix of deliciously diverse cuisine (you\u2019ll find everything from hearty burgers to seafood spring rolls), surrounded by rare Enfield motorcycles.\n\nWinter sun\n\nDesperate to get away from England\u2019s cloud-filled skies? Goa\u2019s the perfect antidote. Visit Goa in peak season (between November and February) and you can look forward to 11 hours of sunshine a day, minimal rain and temperatures of around 30C. Monsoon season in Goa lasts between June and September, although don\u2019t let that put you off. Although the sea is colder and rougher, showers are short and sharp, and Goa is at its greenest during the monsoon period, making it a brilliant time to explore places such as Mollem National Park, on the state\u2019s eastern border.\n\nIt\u2019s one of India\u2019s most wallet-friendly destinations\n\nSure, you can come to Goa and spend thousands of pounds on a night in a suite at a five-star hotel beloved by Bollywood types, but you can also base yourself at one of Goa\u2019s brilliant homestays, or book a hut on the beach for just a few pounds a night. Take Agonda Beach\u2019s Om Sai Beach Huts, for example \u2013 their nightly rates start from just \u00a318 per hut. Food and drink is wonderfully cheap, too. Top of your list should be Panjim\u2019s Bay 15, a laidback beachfront restaurant famous for its chicken xacuti (a type of curry popular in Goa). You\u2019ll pay around \u00a315 for a meal for two, including drinks.\n\nTravel essentials\n\nFor more information on booking a holiday to Goa, visit goaexperience.co.uk", "description": "The Independent\u2019s hotel recommendations are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
