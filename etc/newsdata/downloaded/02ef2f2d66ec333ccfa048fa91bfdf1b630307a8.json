FIFA President Gianni Infantino attended.\n\nThe Asian governing body cited \"existing sanctions in place\" affecting North Korea and acknowledged broadcasters' concerns and logistic challenges around working in Pyongyang next week.\n\n\"The AFC has been advised by its commercial rights partners of the challenges in enabling among other matters, the production and broadcast delivery of the Final match,\" the Malaysia-based soccer body said.\n\nApril 25 is the first North Korean team to advance to the final of the AFC Cup, which began in 2004 and involves teams from lower-ranked Asian countries.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
