Lorenzo Reyes delivers this weeks power rankings and biggest risers and fallers. USA TODAY\n\nIn the aftermath of the controversy on a spurned handshake that never was, Cleveland Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield took the high road.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, San Francisco 49ers cornerback Richard Sherman said on the Pat McAfee Show that he would \u201cget an apology\u201d to Mayfield over comments he made after San Francisco\u2019s 31-3 victory over the Browns. Sherman alleged that Mayfield refused to shake his hand during the pre-game coin toss.\n\nOn Tuesday, however, multiple video angles showed that Mayfield had, in fact shaken hands with Sherman before the coin toss.\n\n\"No, I know what I did,\" Mayfield said when asked if he was bothered by Sherman's comments. \"That\u2019s the one time the camera recording me has gone in my favor.\"\n\nMayfield seemed to be making a joke about the time he was arrested in Arkansas in February 2016 for public intoxication, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. The arrest, in which he tried to run away from police but was tackled, was caught on camera and later made public.\n\n100 WORST NFL TEAMS OF ALL TIME: Could Dolphins, Redskins join most hopeless in history?\n\n49ERS: Richard Sherman doesn't want anyone joining bandwagon\n\nMayfield said he was \u201csurprised\u201d to hear the comments Sherman made, but stressed that he didn\u2019t harbor any ill feelings toward the cornerback.\n\n\"I respect him and who he is as a player,\" Mayfield said. \"He's a great player and has been for a while, in no way did I mean (any disrespect).\"\n\nMayfield said he hadn\u2019t yet heard from Sherman but said \u201cthat\u2019s nice of him\u201d to initiate the apology.\n\nWhile Mayfield took the high road with Sherman, he was less forgiving with 49ers defensive end Nick Bosa. After nearly sacking Mayfield and forcing an intentional grounding penalty shortly before halftime in Monday\u2019s game, Bosa got up and celebrated by waving an imaginary flag and gesturing as though he were planting it into the field. Then, after the game as he celebrated, Bosa took an actual 49ers flag and repeated the gesture.\n\nBosa acknowledged after the game that the celebrations were in response to a September 2017 game in which Mayfield, who was then the quarterback of the Oklahoma Sooners, planted a flag at midfield at Ohio Stadium after the Sooners beat Bosa's Buckeyes, 31-16.\n\n\"I don't think Sherman's was a personal vendetta,\" Mayfield said. \"He said what he said. But Bosa, good for him. He had that premeditated. He's been thinking about that obviously for two years now, so, that's a long time to be think about that loss.\"\n\nMayfield finished Monday night\u2019s loss with 100 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions on 8-of-22 passing.\n\nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes.", "description": "After a controversy revealed that Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield did shake Richard Sherman's hand, the Browns QB took the high road.", "authors": ["Lorenzo Reyes", "Published P.M.
