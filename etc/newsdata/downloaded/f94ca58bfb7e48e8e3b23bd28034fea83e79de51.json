Musk told reporters, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be pretty epic to see that thing take off and come back.\u201d\n\nThe prototype, displayed alongside SpaceX\u2019s original Falcon 1 rocket on Saturday, is made of stainless steel rather than the carbon composite or aluminium-based materials, which Ars Technica noted gives it \u201cexceptional thermal properties\u201d and a lower cost:\n\nAt extremely cold temperatures, stainless steel 301 does not turn brittle; and at the very high temperatures of atmospheric reentry, it does not melt until reaching 1500 degrees Centigrade. Starship therefore requires only a modest heat shield of glass-like thermal tiles. Another benefit is cost, which matters to a company building Starships on its own dime, with the intent to build many of them. Carbon fibre material costs about [$190,000] a ton, he said. Stainless steel sells for [$3,700] a ton.\n\n\u201cStainless steel is by far the best design decision we have made,\u201d Musk said, according to Ars Technica. \u201c... Steel is easy to weld, and weather resistant... Honestly, I\u2019m in love with steel.\u201d\n\n11 years ago today, we launched our first successful mission. To date, we\u2019ve completed 78 launches and have developed the world\u2019s only operational reusable orbital class rockets and spacecraft\u2014capable of launching to space, returning to Earth, and flying again pic.twitter.com/5L0q9PJ90P \u2014 SpaceX (@SpaceX) September 29, 2019\n\nOn the transporter pic.twitter.com/CGNj1MlKAU \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 26, 2019\n\nMusk \u2014 who has a habit of wild proclamations and claims that Starship will eventually carry colonists to Mars \u2014 said that a refined Starship paired with a Super Heavy booster stage, which will increase the rocket\u2019s height to 118 metres and be capable of carrying 99,790kg, could be ready for orbital flights within six months. Musk added SpaceX \u201ccould potentially see people flying next year,\u201d according to the Times. The paper noted that experts say little about Starship is considered infeasible other than its business model, as the rocket is outlandishly large for most commercial uses:\n\nExperts say the technology of Starship lies within the realm of the possible, without requiring impossible physics or unlikely technological leaps. Indeed, Starship employs many ideas that were studied decades ago but never built. What is more puzzling to them is how SpaceX can make money with Starship. Mr. Musk agreed that it was far larger than necessary to launch current satellites. For now, Mr. Musk conceded, there is not much of a commercial market\u2014\u201cnot that\u2019s especially relevant\u201d \u2014 for Starship to fill.\n\nPossible uses include launching SpaceX\u2019s Starlink internet satellite network (which astronomers have worried could interfere with scientific research and contribute to space junk) and presumably very expensive international travel. Musk told reporters, the Times wrote, that Starship could complete a New York to Tokyo trip in 30 minutes and \u201cIt\u2019s basically an I.C.B.M. that lands. Nothing gets there faster than a I.C.B.M. It\u2019s just minus the nuclear bomb and add landing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith any development into uncharted territory, its difficult to predict these things with precision,\u201d Musk added, according to CBS News. \u201cBut I do think things are going to move very fast.\u201d\n\nMusk also predicted that the long-term costs of Starship will come below initial estimates, CNN reported, saying it was \u201cprobably closer to a two or three [billion] than it is to 10.\u201d The reusable nature of the spaceship is critical, Musk added, \u201cIn almost any motor transport \u2014 whether it\u2019s a plane or car, a horse, or bicycle \u2014 it\u2019s reusable. If you could use a car only once, very few people could afford to drive a car. So the critical breakthrough that\u2019s necessary is a rapidly reusable orbital rocket.\u201d\n\nNASA administrator Jim Bridenstine seemed less enthusiastic, fairly clearly calling out SpaceX and Musk in a tweet that suggested the company should instead be focusing on the repeatedly delayed Commercial Crew Program.\n\nSpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon program, which along with competitor Boeing\u2019s CST-100 Starliner project is intended to replace the retired space shuttle, is years behind schedule; a Crew Dragon capsule exploded in April 2019, though SpaceX later identified the issue.\n\n\u201cI am looking forward to the SpaceX announcement tomorrow,\u201d Bridenstine wrote on Saturday. \u201cIn the meantime, Commercial Crew is years behind schedule. NASA expects to the same level of enthusiasm focused on the investments of the American taxpayer. It\u2019s time to deliver.\u201d For his part, Musk has denied that the work on Starship has at all interfered with the delivery timeline for the Dragon capsules (and NASA\u2019s inspector general and former NASA deputy administrator Lori Garver have both pointed to funding shortfalls as reasons for the delays).\n\nMusk said that the next five to six months will see SpaceX building multiple new iterations of Starship, as well as ramping up rocket engine production to a target of one per day by early 2020.\n\n\u201cThe rate at which we will be building ships is going to be quite, quite crazy by space standards,\u201d Musk said, according to NPR.", "description": "SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk unveiled the towering Mk1 prototype of his Starship space vehicle on Saturday in Boca Chica Village, Texas, announcing that the craft will be ready to fly within the next few months....", "authors": ["Tom Mckay", "Julie Muncy"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/zeqdllwh69cj7uxziwxg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
