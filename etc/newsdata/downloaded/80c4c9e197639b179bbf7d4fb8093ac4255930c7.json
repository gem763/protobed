No, not \u201cbuy the book,\u201d which I\u2019ve been trying to get people to do since \u201cBall of Collusion\u201d was published a few weeks back. I\u2019m talking about by the book. That was the memorable phrase Obama National Security Adviser Susan Rice emphasized in her notorious CYA memo.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nRemember? The memo took the form of an email. She wrote it while clearing out of her White House office while Donald Trump was being inaugurated. It purported to summarize a meeting more than two weeks earlier, when President Obama held an Oval Office pow-wow on next steps in the Trump-Russia investigation.\n\nANDREW MCCARTHY: AMERICANS DESERVE A PUBLIC IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY \u2013 SCHIFF AND DEMS SHOULD END THE SECRECY\n\nFully aware that what they were orchestrating was highly irregular (the continuation of a probe targeting the new president even as he entered office), Rice took pains to note that Obama had insisted that everything be done \u201cby the book.\u201d It was a flashing neon sign that \u201cthe book\u201d was being burned. There is no \u201cbook\u201d \u2014 no set of legit procedures and norms \u2014 that endorses the exploitation of executive investigative powers in the service of partisan politics.\n\nThe President\u2019s best Ukraine defense has always been that any quid pro quo demand was not close to an impeachable offense.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThat\u2019s why the Justice Department is pursuing criminal and inspector-general probes of the matter. While we wait on those, Democrats are not idling. With the Mueller collusion caper having flamed out, they have moved on to an \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d in the House, focused on President Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.\n\nMuch of our country opposes impeachment (especially in Trump-friendly districts Democrats need to win to keep control of the lower chamber), so Democrats have refused to conduct a vote to endorse their inquiry. That shows what thin gruel it is. Their theory, though, is analogous to Obama\u2019s \u201cby the book\u201d practices: They allege that Trump exploited executive power for partisan political purposes.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ THE REST OF THIS COLUMN IN THE NATIONAL REVIEW\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ANDREW MCCARTHY", "description": "Foreign relations is categorically distinct from domestic law enforcement.
