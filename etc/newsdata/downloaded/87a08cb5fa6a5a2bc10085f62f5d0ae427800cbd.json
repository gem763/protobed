Many think this water bottle is perfect because of how simple the design is. \u201cThis one is great because you can open it with one hand, and drink while walking without splashing water all over yourself (due to the narrow opening),\u201d one writes, adding, \u201cAt the same time it doesn\u2019t have any fussy parts that are prone to mold (like the ones with straws) so I am confident I am really getting it clean when I wash it.\u201d Hundreds also note the carrying handle as a selling point. \u201cI like the carrying handle it\u2019s really convenient, I can use my phone and hold it with my pinky finger,\u201d one writes, while another says \u201cI only have one functional hand and I love the loop handle and the fact that I am able to press one thick button and it pops open and just one snap and it closes.\u201d If you\u2019re wondering how durable it is, one user writes: \u201cI\u2019ve dropped it. I\u2019ve left it in the car and had it completely freeze. I\u2019ve thrown it in my backpack with my laptop, and tossed it around a little \u2026 It has never leaked. It doesn\u2019t crack.\u201d But at least one user notes one downside: \u201cBecause it\u2019s not insulated, it will sweat but if that\u2019s not a problem for you the price/quality can\u2019t be beat.\u201d", "description": "The best water bottles on Amazon include vacuum-insulated stainless steel water bottles, wide-mouth and narrow-mouth Nalgenes, a gallon-size water bottle, and a filtered water bottle from brands like Brtita, Contigo, S\u2019well, and Corkcicle.", "authors": ["The Editors"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/03/05/05-water-bottles.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
