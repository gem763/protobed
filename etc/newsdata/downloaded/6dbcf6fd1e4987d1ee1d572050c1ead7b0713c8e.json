Whatever the reason, Christopher Columbus is now the fall guy for the sins of slavery, the exploitation of indigenous peoples, the rape of natural resources and most of the legal, financial and territorial abuses that followed the first European steps in the New World. His accusers want to eliminate Columbus Day and replace it with Indigenous Peoples Day.\n\nColumbus is a 15th-century man in a 21st-century court, and the jury is stacked with self-righteous, injured parties who have 20-20 hindsight. Vilifying him won\u2019t change the unfairness of history, but it will delegitimize the outright and undeniable contributions of Western civilization. Tearing down statues to him won\u2019t undo the damage from two worlds colliding, but it will mask the progress and achievements that emerged from two worlds converging.\n\nColumbus Day exists for two reasons. The first: Columbus was the explorer who completed four recorded voyages across the Atlantic, showing great courage, determination and skill. His audacity and vision revolutionized worldwide human migration. Hundreds of millions of immigrants have followed his brave example over the course of more than five centuries. Today, his legacy endures in every immigrant who seeks opportunity and a better life.\n\nThe second reason is that on March 14, 1891, Italian-Americans hit a low point in the long, arduous hazing period that every immigrant group seems condemned to suffer before emerging into the status of respectable American-hood. That year, an angry New Orleans mob lynched 11 Italian immigrants after they were cleared of murder charges. Perhaps the largest lynching in US history, it was condoned by The New York Times and a future president, Teddy Roosevelt.\n\nItalian-Americans desperately needed a hero to stand for them, someone to symbolize their contributions to their adopted land. The following year, Italian-Americans in New York City erected a statue to Columbus at what became \u00adColumbus Circle and inscribed it, \u201cTo the world, he gave a world.\u201d\n\nSo, when the attack on Columbus is as virulent as it is, the Italian-American community is understandably distressed. He is the icon who represents our presence here, and symbolizes our enduring love and commitment to this haven for immigrants.\n\nCritics assign him the most mal\u00adevolent personal motives. Yet cultural anthropologist Carol Delaney notes that Columbus himself never owned a slave and adopted an \u00adindigenous child as his son.\n\nWhy must he shoulder the guilt for the entire 15th century? Slavery was already here in the New World. So were cannibalism and human sacrifice, neither tolerated in the Old World.\n\nBut the forces that shaped the New World were out of the hands of any single man: The Doctrine of Discovery, human greed, free enterprise, international competition spurred by Old World Mercantilism, abuse of power \u2014 all unleashed on a playing field without rules.\n\nThese are dangerous days for our republic. We are being pitted against one another as never before, weakening the pillars of our rational but still imperfect democracy. The attacks on Columbus feed into that conflict.\n\n\u201cIs this an attempt to obliterate the history and contributions of Western civilization?\u201d said one angry man at a recent meeting of Italian-Americans. Another said, \u201cIt\u2019s an attack on Catholicism\u201d; still another, \u201cIt\u2019s an insult to all Italian-Americans.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s not take that path. Let\u2019s not squabble over injustices of the past only to wind up creating new ones. With the knowledge and tools we have acquired, let us remedy the unfair conditions for today and tomorrow \u2014 and let\u2019s do it together.\n\nIndigenous Peoples Day should be a holiday \u2026 and it is: Aug. 9. And November is Indigenous Peoples Month.\n\nThanks to Christopher Columbus\u2019 efforts, the floodgates of immigration were opened. We were granted the \u201cpossibility of a world\u201d . . . a new and just one. Many, many others have worked hard since then, but particularly over the past 243 years, to make that possibility real. It is up to us, the immigrants, to carry on.\n\nAt bottom, we are all immigrants. Whether we walked across an iced-over Bering Strait with our Native American siblings or we came in chains or desperation or hope from Africa, Europe or Asia, we are all immigrants here.\n\nAnd we are all Americans.\n\nAileen Riotto Sirey is founder of the National Organization of Italian Women.
