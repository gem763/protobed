USA TODAY Sports\n\nBronze medal-winning Olympian Adam Rippon had many options to sift through when choosing a title for his memoir. That's because he went to his Twitter account for inspiration.\n\n\"I was in a (expletive) zone on Twitter then,\" Adam Rippon tells USA TODAY, referring to his social media presence during the 2018 Olympic Games in Pyeongchang. Rippon's account became the source of much fascination following an interview with USA TODAY's Christine Brennan, where he criticized the selection of Vice President Mike Pence to lead the U.S. Olympic delegation to South Korea. Pence later tweeted at him not to \"let fake news distract you.\"\n\nRippon ultimately chose this Feb. 14, 2018 tweet as inspiration: \"With everything going on in the media about me this Valentine\u2019s Day I don\u2019t want people to get distracted and forget how beautiful I am (on the outside).\" His memoir, \"Beautiful on the Outside\" (Grand Central Publishing, 245 pp.), is out Tuesday.\n\nHe loves the title because it goes tongue-in-cheek with skating: Drama can be going on behind closed rinks, but when you go out and compete, you have to pretend everything's perfect. \"You don\u2019t want to seem weak in front of your competitors and, it\u2019s this really 'beautiful on the outside' sort of mentality,\" he says.\n\nWith everything going on in the media about me this Valentine\u2019s Day I don\u2019t want people to get distracted and forget how beautiful I am (on the outside) \u2014 Adam Rippon (@Adaripp) February 14, 2018\n\nWhat you may not know about Adam Rippon\n\nRippon's life may indeed have looked beautiful on the outside \u2013 but readers will quickly learn at times it wasn't beautiful at all.\n\nFailing to make the 2014 Sochi Olympics, struggling with his diet, dealing with romantic and familial relationship issues, navigating his coming-out experience \u2013 Rippon's sleek, stunning skating doesn't tell his whole story.\n\n\"Beautiful on the Outside,\" by Adam Rippon. (Photo: Grand Central Publishing)\n\nFor example, one of his coaches told Rippon that he would stop accepting money from his mother and wanted him to pay for everything on his own. Rippon agreed \u2013 but to save money, ended up eating free green apples and drinking TAZO tea from a resort gym where he worked out. The problem? Rippon is allergic to apples. He had an itchy throat during that time (that's where the tea came in to help).\n\nAs for coming out: Once he came out publicly in aSkating Magazine article in 2015, his mother was his no. 1 fan. She was worried for him previously, as she had many LGBTQ friends growing up who died during the AIDS crisis and wanted to save him from the things they had gone through. She was worried it would hold back his skating career. He said it was important for him to do, and his mom trusted him.\n\nAdam Rippon competes in the men's figure skating short program during the Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic Winter Games at Gangneung Ice Arena on Feb. 16. (Photo: Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nRippon had girlfriends in the past and felt like he liked them. \"If I'm being 100 percent honest, the reason I wasn't having sex with the girls that I had dated was because I thought I was being a good guy,\" he writes.\n\nIt wasn't until he was with a man that something clicked. \"These are the feelings that everybody talks about,\" he tells USA TODAY.\n\nRippon's book, however, isn't all serious or depressing. Much like his Twitter account, the book is full of pithy one-liners, jokes and pop-culture references. Wait until you get to the part about an incident between a hawk and two birds he was pet-sitting (we won't spoil the ending).\n\nAlso, remember that his birthday is Nov. 11. Trust us. \"That was my Taylor Swift Easter egg, that at least someone would remember my birthday,\" he says.\n\n'He lied every single day': Adam Rippon slams 'Dancing With the Stars' contestant Sean Spicer\n\nWould Adam Rippon have a chat with Mike Pence now?\n\nRippon would be open to talking to Pence, though he'd want to bring people with him to share their stories.\n\n\"Mike Pence hasn\u2019t affected my life. He\u2019s affected the lives of a lot of other people,\" Rippon says. He adds that they deserve to have the time in front of him to tell him what they\u2019ve gone through because of legislation he\u2019s pushed, but that it's not his conversation.\n\nRippon claims, however, he knows Pence's outreach in the first place was no more than a \"stunt.\"\n\n\"I knew it was a stunt when I was getting tweeted at by the vice president directly at the Olympics,\" he says.\n\n'The Masked Singer' egg, and 'Dancing With the Stars'\n\nRippon came home to trending topics on Twitter recently, and saw his name, \"impeachment\" and \"Nancy Pelosi.\" Naturally, he was confused. He realized that this had to do with speculation that he was the egg on FOX's reality show \"The Masked Singer.\" The egg turned out to be another ice-skating Olympian: Johnny Weir! Rippon says he loves the show.\n\nSpeaking of reality television: Rippon also spoke out about the current \"Dancing With the Stars\" cast. He didn't have kind words for current \"Dancing\" contestant Sean Spicer.\n\n\"I had Tonya Harding on my cast \u2026 but this cast is a little bit more extreme,\" Rippon says.\n\nRippon says he isn't a Spicer fan, suggesting that the former press secretary and White House communications director \"lied\" during his tenure. \"I know he was just doing his job, but he lied every single day,\" Rippon says. \"Sean Spicer's a (expletive) liar.\"\n\nRippon's candid nature is evident in the book, in conversation and on his Twitter account. The best part? It doesn't seem like a calculation: He says he only posts items on social media he thinks his friends will find funny.\n\n\"Because of that the people who have followed me can feel like I\u2019m already friends with them,\" he says.\n\nNoted.\n\n5 books not to miss: Jojo Moyes' 'The Giver of Stars,' Zadie Smith, Leigh Bardugo\n\nThe best books becoming must-see movies: 'Little Women,' 'Cats' and more\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2019/10/11/adam-rippon-spills-on-twitter-mike-pence-and-the-masked-singer/3853782002/", "description": "Bronze medal-winning Olympian Adam Rippon's new memoir, \"Beautiful on the Outside,\" debuts Oct. 15.", "authors": ["David Oliver", "John Sandford", "Rachel Maddow", "Delia Owens", "Stephen King", "Ta-Nehisi Coates", "Published A.M.
