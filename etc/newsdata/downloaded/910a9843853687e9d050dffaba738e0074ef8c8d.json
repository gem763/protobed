In many other countries, including our opponent last night, the state has taken serious measures to get rid of hooliganism. All we can do is condemn it but we do not have the jurisdiction to investigate hooligans.\"\n\nBulgarian fans have already been sanctioned for other racist abuse in qualifying for Euro 2020 and played the match against England on Monday in a partially closed stadium.\n\nIn his post, Borissov also called for Mihailov to resign because of the team's poor results. He said he ordered sports minister Krasen Kralev to terminate any relations with Mihailov until he quits.\n\nZapryanov, however, at first said Mihailov would not step down. The resignation announcement came a short time later.\n\nBulgaria is last in its Euro 2020 qualifying group but will have a second chance to advance through playoffs in March.\n\nMihailov, who served as president of the federation for 14 years, played in England after the 1994 World Cup and later was elected to the UEFA executive committee for eight years until February.\n\nFIFA has rules protecting soccer federations from government interference, including suspension as a possible punishment.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "Criticized around Europe for the racist behavior of Bulgarian fans and under pressure from the country's prime minister following a run of poor results, the president of the country's soccer federation has resigned", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ebeeee93ffea014c2e37a4605b2066be8c0fff03/c=0-214-2711-1739/local/-/media/2019/10/15/USATODAY/usatsports/55823b2613f34d6db6cc5afac97d2700.jpg?width=2711&height=1525&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
