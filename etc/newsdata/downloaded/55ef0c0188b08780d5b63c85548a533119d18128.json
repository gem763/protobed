When these dust particles are breathed in, they can cause respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses.\n\nDuring a speech at a conference earlier this year, Thailand\u2019s prime minister, Prayut Chan-o-cha, floated the idea of completely moving the capital as a way to dramatically reduce traffic and overcrowding.\n\nEarlier this year, Indonesian officials announced they were preparing to move the nation\u2019s capital from Jakarta to Borneo in large part because of rising sea levels.\n\nVisit Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nDense clouds of dangerous toxic smog suffocated Bangkok\u2019s air on Monday, forcing residents to seek shelter inside and wear special masks.\n\nThe thick smog \u2013 which is caused by a mix of ultra fine dust particles emitted from vehicles and construction sites and high humidity levels \u2013 has grown so bad in recent years that some of the nation\u2019s highest officials are considering moving the capital entirely.\n\nSMOG: A dozen districts in Thailand's capital of Bangkok are covered in smog today at unhealthy levels pic.twitter.com/Pyo9y9TEzo \u2014 Bloomberg TicToc (@tictoc) September 30, 2019\n\nThe dust particles, which are known by the identifier PM2.5, are thin enough to enter a person\u2019s bloodstream if they breathe them in. Once inside the body, the pollutants can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses.\n\nThe Thailand government has set the bar for \u201csafe\u201d levels of PM2.5 at 50 micrograms per cubic meter of air. On Monday, PM2.5 levels soared to 79 micrograms, The Seattle Times reported.\n\nThailand\u2019s government is considering moving the capital\n\ncaption A worker rides an elevator in smog a smog filled Bangkok on Monday. source Getty\n\nIn a statement released on Facebook, Thailand\u2019s prime minister, Prayut Chan-o-cha, told residents to avoid going outside and advised wearing special masks to keep from breathing in the toxic smog. Chan-o-cha ordered government agencies to ramp up their anti-pollution efforts and simultaneously instructed private manufacturing and construction companies to reduce their output in a desperate attempt to quickly bring pollution levels down.\n\nEven with these concentrated efforts, dangerous levels of smog are expected to continue hovering around the Thai capital for the next few days.\n\nIn an interview with ABC News, one Bangkok resident described a harrowing scene of residents walking into work coughing violently, with blood running from their nostrils.\n\n\u201cA lot of my friends are saying they come to the office, their noses are running,\u201d Bangkok officer worker Piyavathara Natthadana told ABC. \u201cAll of them are really coughing today. It\u2019s not normal anymore.\u201d\n\nMassive overcrowding, traffic congestion, and lackluster regulations have all played a major role in Bangkok\u2019s pollution woes, leading some major officials, including prime minister Chan-o-cha, to float the idea of moving the capital entirely. Chan-o-cha hinted at the possible relocation effort during an address to the World Conference earlier this month.\n\n\u201cThe first is to find a city that\u2019s neither too far nor too expensive to move to,\u201d Chan-o-cha said. \u201cThe second is to move to outer Bangkok to reduce crowding.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister stressed that more research is needed before the government officially decides to move to the outskirts of Bangkok but said it\u2019s possible such a move could happen under his administration.\n\nIndonesia moved its capital because it\u2019s sinking into the sea\n\nIf Bangkok were to move the capital, it would do so one the heels of similar initiatives being implemented by Indonesia. In that case, Indonesia has planned to move its capital from Jakarta to Borneo due in large part to the fact that the former capital city, which is home to 10 million people, is sinking.\n\ncaption Bangkok residents were told to remain inside and wear special smog masks on Monday. source Getty\n\nWhile the Indonesian example proves such a move is theoretically possible, some Thai officials, like National Economic and Social Development Council secretary-general Thosaporn Sirisamphand, expressed skepticism over the possibility of such a drastic move actually happening in Thailand.\n\n\u201cCapital relocation is a big issue and needs serious cooperation from various agencies,\u201d Sirisamphand told The Bangkok Post. \u201cI think Gen Prayut just threw an idea out to the public on how to tackle traffic congestion in Bangkok.\u201d\n\nMonday marks the second time this year Bangkok officials have been forced to scramble to mitigate the toxic smog. During the other incident, which occurred in January, firefighters sprayed the air with gushing water from giant hoses in an attempt to bring pollution levels down.", "description": "Business Insider - The consideration comes as overcrowding and dense traffic have led to two toxic smog outbreaks in one year..
