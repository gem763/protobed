If you really want to watch, these are the main storylines to keep an eye on:\n\nOpponent: Miami Dolphins (0-4)\n\nWhere: Hard Rock Stadium, Miami Gardens, Fla.\n\nWhen: Sunday, Oct. 13, 1 p.m.\n\nTelevision: Fox\n\nRadio: The Team 980, ESPN 630AM\n\nWhat to watch for:\n\n- Bill Callahan takes over for the first game of the post-Jay Gruden era. The last time the offensive line coach held a head coaching gig in the NFL, he led the Raiders to a Super Bowl appearance and went 4-12 a year later. There are tangible ways his practices were different from Gruden\u2019s this week, from having players run sprints at the end of sessions to bringing in referees to call penalties. Callahan also wants to emphasize the rushing attack, so watch for whether the Redskins\u2018 percentage of run plays goes up in Week 6.\n\n- Is Washington headed for yet another season with a damaged offensive line? Guard Brandon Scherff missed the last two games with a sprained ankle and was limited in practice this week. So were right tackle Morgan Moses, with a shoulder issue, and left tackle Donald Penn, who left last week\u2019s game with a hamstring injury. Who starts and who sits Sunday is up in the air. Of course, another week goes by with regular starting left tackle Trent Williams nowhere in sight.\n\n- Seriously, someone does have to win \u2014 unless these two sides are doomed for a long, painful draw. The Dolphins named Josh Rosen their starting quarterback for the rest of the year, and while the Redskins may envy that kind of QB stability, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that both teams are almost equally bad. Miami and Washington rank bottom-three in both points scored and points allowed per game, and bottom-five in both yards gained and yards allowed. The loser is sure to be the unanimous No. 32 in every power ranking published next week.\n\nPre-game reading:\n\n\u201cWashington\u2019s bye comes in Week 10. The team easily could be 0-9 or 1-8 by that point.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf Haskins isn\u2019t inserted into the starting lineup \u2014 for good \u2014 by Week 11, they might as well draft another first-round QB next year,\u201d @DeronSnyder writes. https://t.co/4oo1bzfCMZ \u2014 WashTimes Sports (@WashTimesSports) October 10, 2019\n\nAdrian Peterson called this the \u201cbest week of practice since I\u2019ve been here\u201d with the #Redskins, @Matthew_Paras reports from Ashburn https://t.co/HmTK3Z9I54 \u2014 WashTimes Sports (@WashTimesSports) October 11, 2019\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
