Therefore, if Benny Gantz offers Netanyahu to sit down with him one-on-one, I'm confident that Netanyahu will sit with him.\"\n\nIsraeli public television reporters caught up with Gantz outside his home after a workout on Tuesday morning.\n\n\"We're always optimistic, it's a way of life,\" he said from behind the wheel of his car, dressed in shorts and a T-shirt.\n\nA senior member of his centrist Blue and White alliance was strongly critical of Netanyahu.\n\n\"What has Bibi done with the mandate to build a government? Four weeks of nothing,\" Ofer Shelah said on Twitter, using Netanyahu's nickname.\n\n\"He passed the time in order to continue as prime minister for a little while longer... Bibi wants elections. That is obvious.\"\n\nRivlin said Monday night he intends to ask Gantz to try to form a government, but he can take up to three days to hear out the parties elected to parliament before officially tasking him with doing so.\n\nThe Blue and White leader had no political experience before he mounted his challenge to the prime minister he once worked with as military chief of staff, but has now found himself at the doorstep of power.\n\nWhether he can enter the office Netanyahu has held for a total of more than 13 years, however, is a challenge that could bedevil even the most skilled politicians.\n\nReporting from Jerusalem, Al Jazeera's Harry Fawcett explained that Israel faced a turbulent time ahead.\n\n\"His [Gantz] prospects of forming a minority or unity government with the Likud potentially jettisoning Netanyahu, both look extremely unlikely.\n\n\"He may well fail as well. If that happens, the mandate will go the Knesset. If no government is formed after all of this, then Netanyahu could stay in office until a third election is held. But there may be a legal challenge as to whether a prime minister could sit in office while being indicted.\"\n\nDisunity on unity\n\nThe deadlock following September 17 polls will likely require major concessions or a decision by members of Netanyahu's right-wing Likud to abandon him - and both of those options appear a long way off for now.\n\nBoth Likud and Blue and White say they want a unity government, but they are divided on how.\n\nLikud has been seeking to negotiate based on a compromise set out by Rivlin that takes into account the possibility the premier will be indicted for corruption in the upcoming weeks.\n\nIt could see him remain prime minister for now, but step aside at some point later as he combats the charges.\n\nGantz would take over as acting premier under such a scenario.\n\nBlue and White said Gantz should be prime minister first under any rotation arrangement since his party won the most seats, finishing with 33 compared with Likud's 32.\n\nGantz also said Blue and White cannot serve in a government with a prime minister facing serious indictment.\n\nNetanyahu added a further complication to the coalition talks.\n\nHe pledged not to abandon the smaller right-wing and religious parties that support him in parliament, saying he represents the entire bloc in coalition negotiations.\n\nThat condition is also unacceptable to Gantz, who said it would mean Blue and White joining a Netanyahu government as a junior member.", "description": "If former military chief also fails to form a government within the next 28 days, Israel may face another election.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/22/62d5134267f84432808bf31c90389afa_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
