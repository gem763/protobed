Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), a leading 2020 Democrat presidential primary candidate, says transgender border crossers and illegal aliens \u201cmust\u201d be released into the United States.\n\nWarren, with Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) where she demands that transgender border crossers and illegal aliens be released into the U.S. rather than being held in Mexico under President Trump\u2019s \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy.\n\n\u201cWhile in detention, transgender migrants and asylum seekers are particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment, discrimination, and abuse,\u201d Warren writes in the letter. \u201cThe United States should protect individuals fleeing persecution and targeted violence, including persecution based on gender identity or expression \u2014 not subject them to further harm.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrans migrants and asylum seekers are particularly vulnerable,\u201d Warren wrote on Twitter. \u201cWe must end unnecessary detention and enforce strict standards to keep trans migrants and asylum seekers safe \u2014 and I\u2019ll continue holding our government accountable when they fail to do so.\u201d\n\nTrans migrants and asylum seekers are particularly vulnerable.

Likewise, Warren has said that border crossers must not be \u201cunnecessarily\u201d detained and instead freed into the interior of the U.S. and has claimed that driving up foreign competition in the labor market by providing amnesty to 11 million to 22 million illegal aliens is \u201cgood\u201d for American workers.\n\nThough Warren has taken a populist-nationalist stance on various economic policies, her plan to support more immigration to the U.S. is a key component of the globalist agenda supported by the nation\u2019s donor class.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
