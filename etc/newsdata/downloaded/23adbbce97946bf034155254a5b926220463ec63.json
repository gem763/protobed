Courtesy of Seta\n\nThe sweet-sour concoctions of this one Michelin-starred deluxe establishment tantalize taste buds.\n\nWith deep roots in southern Italy's Puglia region, chef Antonio Guida combines his native cooking style with unexpected Asian ingredients, primarily from Japan and China.\n\nBehind tall glass windows and in front of an open kitchen, diners savor exotic flavored dishes such as butterfly-shaped farfalle with king crab soup, coriander scented seafood and coconut, cauliflower with almond milk sauce, yuzu juice and seafood, and roasted blue lobster with zabaglione, white miso and matcha tea.\n\nThe wine list features more than 1,300 bottles from Israel, California and South Africa among others.\n\nSeta , Via Monte di Piet\u00e0 18; +39 02 8731 8897\n\nRistorante Berton\n\nBroth is the king of Chef Andrea Berton's cuisine at his eponymous restaurant. Courtesy Marco Scarpa\n\nSet in the futuristic district of Porta Nuova, the niche private rooms of this one-Michelin starred restaurant offer intimate dinners.\n\nHere, it's all about the broth philosophy. When Italians say \"it's the usual broth,\" they mean the usual plain stuff, the drill -- a popular Italian sentiment. But not chef Andrea Berton.\n\nBroth is literally the king of his cuisine. He's dead serious about it and believes it can be drank or poured in a plate.\n\nThe eight-course broth-tasting menu spans from raw ham broth with codfish, parsley bread and radish to veal broth with Nonino grappa liqueur spray and lemon, caramel and rosemary broth with cereal and beer ice cream.\n\nRistorante Berton , Via Mike Bongiorno 13; +39 02 67075801\n\nTano Passami L'Olio\n\nGeatano Simonato's Tano Passami L 'Olio is funny, simple, healthy and creative. Courtesy Tano Passami L'Olio\n\nThe name says it all. Literally meaning -- \"Tano, please pass me the (olive) oil\" -- Gaetano Simonato's one Michelin-starred cuisine is funny, simple, healthy and creative.\n\nThere's no butter or cream -- just the premium extra virgin olive oils he uses to spice up the dishes. But the recipes are far from ordinary.\n\nA caramelized dish of scallops and leeks served with meringue and crunchy red beetroot is just as extravagant and unexpected as homemade ricotta and caviar ravioli with purple potato puree.\n\nRelated content Gray Malin's new book takes on Italy\n\nInnocenti Evasioni\n\nInnocenti Evasioni features a Zen garden and sublime seasonal dishes. Courtesy Innocenti Evasioni\n\nChef Tommaso Arrigoni believes food is not just food.\n\nHis seasonal menu is the constant pursuit to transform the best raw materials into emotion-arousing plates and savory experiences, hence the name \"Innocent Evasions\" of his Michelin-starred temple located in an old industrial district and featuring a Zen garden.\n\nIt's an ideal location for escaping the metropolitan buzz and enjoying a moment of peace and relaxation.\n\nFish and meat are cooked with fresh and dry fruits. Signature dishes include fried oyster with raisins, swordfish with pistachio mayonnaise and baby piglet with sweet potatoes and balsamic vinegar.", "description": "If there's one city in Italy that dares to mix culinary traditions with experimental twists, it's Milan.
