Not only is the 41-year-old a Chelsea hero but the fans recognise that he has a huge job ahead of him. There will be more afternoons like the 2-2 draw with Sheffield United. There will be worse days. Quite a few of them.\n\nSaturday was bad enough. Chelsea were two goals up at half-time and should have been cruising but they conceded goals in the first and last minutes of the second period. In between Chris Wilder\u2019s team had the better of the game.\n\nLampard is a substantial presence at the Bridge but his team is lightweight. The club\u2019s transfer ban has left the squad short of the gravitas needed to compete at the top of the Premier League. They lack physicality and it showed against United.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nInitially, it did not appear that power and maturity would be needed to beat the newly-promoted side. A pair of dreadful errors gave Chelsea a cushion. Tammy Abraham was the recipient of these mistakes and the 21-year-old is beginning to show hints that he is good enough to lead the line at this level. He was a handful for the United defence from the start, bustling across the back line, producing dancing if fruitless stepovers and shooting whenever there was a sniff of a chance. His goals were gifts, though. For the first he headed a Cesar Azpilicueta cross rather tamely goalwards but Dean Henderson failed to gather the ball under pressure from Christian Pulisic. Abraham fired the rebound into the net.\n\nThe second was even more of a farce from the visiting side\u2019s point of view. John Egan and Jack O\u2019Connell got tangled up trying to deal with a routine lob forward. The ball ran to Abraham who doubled the lead from just inside the box.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Pulisic has not been able to replicate the threat and creativity lost when Eden Hazard moved to Real Madrid. Mason Mount, highly regarded during his spell under Lampard at Derby County, struggled to get onto the ball and into the game. Both need time to grow into top-flight players but neither looks ready to impose themselves on matches like this.\n\nThe midfield was equally insubstantial. Jorginho was deeply unconvincing \u2013 as he has been throughout his career in SW6 \u2013 and Ross Barkley and Mateo Kovacic were largely peripheral. The central areas will be better when N\u2019Golo Kante recovers from injury but the Frenchman is not the panacea for Chelsea\u2019s problems.\n\nWilder had some hard words for his team at the interval but even before that, around the half-hour mark, there was a palpable moment when the United players seemed to exchange glances that said, \u2018hang on, these aren\u2019t great.\u2019 While the visiting team\u2019s belief grew, Chelsea\u2019s ebbed.\n\nEnda Stevens was emboldened enough to dribble down the left wing and pull back a cross to Callum Robinson. The forward had missed a headed chance just before Chelsea\u2019s second goal but he made no mistake now, opening his body and directing the ball into the net.\n\nRobinson was a constant threat, dragging Kurt Zouma across the area and tormenting the centre half at the near post. Zouma gave everything but appeared short of confidence. When he turned in Robinson\u2019s cross for the equaliser in the dying minutes it was no surprise. He was often a crucial millisecond late to the flight of the ball.\n\nGiven the youthfulness of the squad \u2013 it was Chelsea\u2019s youngest starting XI in the Premier League era \u2013 there was always a danger that inexperience could be a factor in the team\u2019s lack of game management. Lampard shot that idea down. \u201cIt is not just the young players,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is up to all of us to resolve the issue.\u201d\n\nThe manager is right. Once in front, Chelsea were unable to impose any level of authority on the match. Lampard\u2019s substitutions were questionable. Billy Gilmour might have a great future in front of him but sending on the 18-year-old to bolster the midfield with six minutes left looked perverse, as did removing Abraham. Yes, the team needed energy but control was more important.\n\nUnited were open and adventurous. Against a better side their approach might have been considered naive. The teams Lampard played in would have picked off Wilder\u2019s men with ease. On Saturday, the Blades were rarely in trouble in the second half and after this experience will go into the international break with renewed faith that they can make a good impression in the division.\n\nLampard has talent at his disposal but it is callow and unfocused. The team will suffer plenty of growing pains. Stamford Bridge will need to be patient in the coming months. The manager has to ensure that belief in the squad is as strong as in the stands.", "description": "Stamford Bridge is sympathetic to Frank Lampard.
