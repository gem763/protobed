Today, we\u2019ve got hot bods, dad bods, metal bods, all sorts of bods! And that\u2019s even before we get to Canada\u2019s finest superheroes (some of whom I\u2019m sure also have lovely bods, I\u2019m certain). Check it out!\n\nMedicom Toy MAFEX Spider-Man Into The Spider-Verse Peter B. Parker\n\nA few weeks ago Medicom blessed us with our first look at their ultimate take on Into the Spider-Verse\u2019s Miles Morales, and now, he has an incredibly underprepared mentor figure to go with him!\n\nClocking in at 6.3 inches tall, Peter Parker \u2014 sorry, Peter B. Parker \u2014 actually comes with a bunch of accessories replaceable parts to recreate either his appearance as an, uh, thicker-round-the-middle, experienced version of Spider-Man or in his raggedy, half-clothed self from when he first arrives in Miles\u2019 universe.\n\nBeyond the pieces and fabric clothing to recreate either look, Peter comes with some pizza (of course), a coffee cup (of course), various hands and webbing attachments to pose him mid-swing, multiple headpieces depicting him masked, unmasked, and even partially wearing his spider-mask, and a loose mask to grip for when he isn\u2019t wearing. That is attention to detail right there. He\u2019ll set you back roughly $125 when he releases alongside Miles in June next year. [Medicom]\n\nHasbro Marvel Legends Series 6-inch Alpha Flight 6-Pack\n\nSan Diego Comic-Con isn\u2019t the only opportunity for toymakers to release limited-run collectible versions of their wares.\n\nAt Toronto\u2019s Fan Expo last week, Hasbro unveiled a six-pack of six-inch Alpha Flight figures, which, if you\u2019re not familiar, are Marvel\u2019s most polite and apologetic heroes hailing from the great white north (aka Canada). Available in December for about $163, the six-pack includes Snowbird, Shaman, Aurora, Vindicator, Puck and Northstar, and not a single miniature bottle of maple syrup to be seen \u2014 thankfully.\n\nMezco One:12 Collective Batman: Supreme Knight Figure\n\nEven the Dark Knight himself is forced to work right up until retirement if he wants that cushy Bat-pension to fall back on. But as Mezco\u2019s One:12 Collective Batman: Supreme Knight figure demonstrates, we should all hope we look as good as Bruce does when we go completely grey up top.\n\nIt won\u2019t officially be available until February 2020, but to help convince you to drop $120 the figure boasts over 30 points of articulation, three swappable heads included an unmasked Bruce, nine different hands, a giant collection of weapon accessories (including 10 batarangs) and a costume with stubby bat ears that don\u2019t look quite as ridiculous.\n\nS.H. Figuarts Avengers: Endgame Thor\n\nYes, it\u2019s finally time for Dad-bod Thor to get his moment in the merchandise spotlight. With Endgame far behind us now, we no longer have to pretend that all those toys of a svelter, space-suited Thor were a true representation of the wayward god of thunder\u2019s appearance in the film, and Bandai is happy to oblige us with a Figuarts with a specially-designed body to accomodate Thor packing some... extra heat.\n\nWhat, I\u2019m clearly talking about him having both Stormbreaker and Mjolnir, of course! As well as various hands to wield either axe or hammer (or both at the same time), Thor has a fabric cape and with a poseable wire armature inside it for extra dramatic action. A web store exclusive in Japan, Thor will cost you around $90 when he releases in January 2020 \u2014 but preorders are live now!\n\n1000Toys RE-Edit Halo Master Chief 1/12-Scale Figure\n\nThe character that helped establish Microsoft as a legit contender in the console gaming market can, as far as we\u2019re concerned, never have too many figures. But 1000Toys\u2019 RE-Edit Master Chief has to be one of the impressive scaled versions of the character, featuring a remarkably detailed recreation of his Mjolnir Mark V assault armour from the original Halo game.\n\nAvailable sometime in April of 2020, the figure stands just seven-inches tall but costs around $185 since it\u2019s made from a mix of die-cast metal and plastic and weighs in at just over a pound. It also includes all the requisite Master Chief accessories like an energy sword, a pair of M6D pistols, and the MA5B assault rifle.\n\nFactory Entertainment The Man With the Golden Gun Limited Edition Golden Gun Prop Replica\n\nI\u2019m (Andrew) not entirely sure why I was allowed to repeatedly watch The Man With the Golden Gun when I was a kid. But it remains one of my favourite James Bond films to date for one single reason: Francisco Scaramanga\u2019s golden gun that Voltron\u2019d together from seemingly innocuous items.\n\nFor many years I was obsessed with that prop, and built many (terrible) Lego replicas. Decades later, Factory Entertainment wants to sell you the (almost) real thing. Aside from actually firing bullets it\u2019s fully functional and assembled from 18-carat gold plated items including a fountain pen, a lighter, a cigarette case and a cufflink.\n\nPre-orders start on September 1, but at around $1,187 you\u2019ll need MI6's budget to add this to your collection.\n\nMattel Inspiring Women Sally Ride Barbie\n\nEvery International Women\u2019s Day, Mattel announces a new real-life historical figure to join their special line of \u201cInspiring Women\u201d Barbie dolls \u2014 and this year is getting an astronomical boost in the form of noted NASA icon Sally Ride, the first American woman in space and, after a posthumous reveal in her obituary, the first known LGBT astronaut.\n\nAnnounced alongside a Barbie of civil rights activist Rosa Parks, the Sally Ride Barbie features the astronaut in her 1983 Challenger mission suit and comes with both a communication headpiece and an astronaut helmet to wear.\n\nThe Ride Barbie is available now, with the Rosa Parks Barbie joining her in the series on Septemeber 6, for about $46 each.\n\nEditor's Note: The Mattel store doesn't appear to ship to Australia.\n\nLego Pumpkin Head Storage Container\n\nYou might already be well into costume prep for Halloween, but have you given any thought to how you\u2019re going to haul treats around? Don\u2019t panic, Lego\u2019s got you covered with its new pumpkin head storage container that looks like a life-size minifigure version of the Headless Horseman\u2019s \u2014 err... head. It will about $18 for the small version, and $30 for the large, and hopefully it will arrive well ahead of October 31 so you can strap some carrying handles on there.", "description": "Welcome back to Toy Aisle, our regular round-up of the best toys we\u2019ve seen on the internet this week.
