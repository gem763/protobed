Unlike the whistle-blower, whose identity is still unknown, Vindman had first-hand knowledge of the call; he also complained up the chain of command.\n\nVindman would seem like a difficult witness to attack: a career soldier, an active-duty lieutenant colonel in the Army, a Purple Heart recipient for a wound from an IED in Iraq. Yet imagining that Trump\u2019s allies might struggle to impugn Vindman badly overestimates their scruples.\n\nShortly after the statement was released, Laura Ingraham covered his story on her Fox News show.\n\n\u201cThis is buried in the New York Times piece tonight,\u201d Ingraham said. \u201cHe\u2019s a decorated colonel, by the way, in the Iraq war. \u2018Because [Colonel Vindman] emigrated from Ukraine along with his family when he was a child and is fluent in Ukrainian and Russian, Ukrainian officials sought advice from him on how to deal with Mr. Giuliani, though they typically communicated in English.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe went on: \u201cHere we have a U.S. national security official who is advising Ukraine while working inside the Ukraine, apparently against the president\u2019s interest, and usually they spoke in English. Isn\u2019t that kid of an interesting angle to this story?\u201d\n\nDavid A. Graham: Impeachment just became inevitable\n\nIngraham\u2019s comment is spurious in several ways. First, it was Vindman\u2019s job to speak with Ukrainians. Second, it is of course useful for foreign-policy professionals to speak the language of the foreign countries they handle. Third, other officials, including Sondland and Ambassador William Taylor have recounted offering advice to Ukrainians on navigating their relationship with Giuliani. Fourth, there is no evidence that Vindman was acting against the president\u2019s interest; indeed, he was trying to execute official U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine, even as Giuliani ran a rogue and dubiously legal shadow foreign policy.\n\nJohn Yoo, a former Bush administration official and law professor at the University of California, reacted to Ingraham\u2019s prompt by casually accusing Vindman of treason.\n\n\u201cI find that astounding and some people might call that espionage,\u201d said Yoo,\u201cI find that astounding and some people might call that espionage,\u201d said Yoo. (This may illustrate the danger of allowing Yoo, author of a Bush-era legal opinion justifying torture, to weigh in on questions of law and morality.)\n\nThe attacks continued Tuesday morning. On CNN, newly hired contributor and former Representative Sean Duffy baselessly accused Vindman of dual loyalty or treason.\n\n\u201cIt seems very clear that he is incredibly concerned about Ukrainian defense,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cI don't know that he's concerned about American policy, but his main mission was to make sure that the Ukraine got those weapons. I understand that. We all have an affinity to our homeland where we came from\u2026. He\u2019s entitled to his opinion, he has an affinity for the Ukraine. He speaks Ukrainian, and he came from the country and he wants to make sure they're safe and free. I understand that.\u201d", "description": "Without substantive defenses of the president, and deprived of process complaints, Trump\u2019s allies resort to toxic xenophobia and baseless accusations.", "authors": ["David A.
