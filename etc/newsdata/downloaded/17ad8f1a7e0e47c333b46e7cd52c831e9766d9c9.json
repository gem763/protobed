Post 2012, I had a few hissy fits\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "The cyclist on the birth of his daughter, his estranged father, and living life in the public eye\n\nBorn in Belgium, Bradley Wiggins, 39, grew up in London. He became a junior world champion in 1998 and won Olympic bronze in 2000. In 2012, he was the first Briton to win the Tour de France and took his fourth Olympic gold medal in the time trial in London. He was knighted the following year. In 2016, he won gold in Rio, becoming Britain\u2019s most decorated Olympian, and announced retirement. He is touring the UK with his show, Bradley Wiggins: An Evening With, until 6 October.\n\nWhen were you happiest?\n\nWhen my second child Bella was born in 2006. I missed my son Ben being born because I was racing, so seeing it for the first time was quite an experience.\n\nWhat is the trait you most deplore in yourself?\n\nOne I\u2019ve tried to change: burying my head in the sand.\n\nWhat is the trait you most deplore in others?\n\nCondescension.\n\nWhat was your most embarrassing moment?\n\nLiving out most of my adult life in the public eye. Post 2012, I had a few hissy fits, throwing my bike on the floor, things like that, and they are all now on YouTube.\n\nAside from a property, what\u2019s the most expensive thing you\u2019ve bought?\n\nI bought a pink leader\u2019s jersey from the 1953 Tour of Italy which belonged to Swiss rider Hugo Koblet. I spent \u00a345,000.\n\nWhat is your most treasured possession?\n\nWhen I was 14, I bunked off school to watch my hero, a British rider called Sean Yates, take the yellow jersey in the Tour de France. I have that jersey.\n\nWhat do you most dislike about your appearance?\n\nI am completely happy in my own skin, other than a bit of weight round the middle which I am trying to get rid of.\n\nWho would play you in the film of your life?\n\nMichael Fassbender.\n\nBradley Wiggins: \u2018I\u2019d have had more rights as a murderer \u2026 I only asked for a fair trial\u2019 | Donald McRae Read more\n\nWhat is your most unappealing habit?\n\nFarting in public.\n\nWhat is the worst thing anyone\u2019s said to you?\n\nWhen I met my dad again when I was 18 [they had been estranged], I didn\u2019t really like the person I was confronted with. He said, \u201cI want to make up for 17 years of not being there.\u201d I was scared of him and I didn\u2019t know what to say. I chose to become estranged from him again.\n\nWhat does love feel like?\n\nLoss of control.\n\nWhat is the worst job you\u2019ve done?\n\nI\u2019ve never had a job.\n\nWhat has been your biggest disappointment?\n\nNever going back to the Tour de France and trying to win again.\n\nWhat is the closest you\u2019ve come to death?\n\nI had quite a chequered childhood. I had a knife put to my throat once when I was a kid, which was very scary.\n\nWhat single thing would improve the quality of your life?\n\nThis isn\u2019t a complaint, but obscurity would be nice. You can\u2019t have a bad day in public because everyone\u2019s got phones.\n\nHow would you like to be remembered?\n\nAs an honest person who did his best.\n\nTell us a joke\n\nMy girlfriend said she\u2019d only marry me if I overcame my ambulance obsession. I can\u2019t wait to go down on one knee-nor-knee-nor-knee-nor.", "description": "The cyclist on the birth of his daughter, his estranged father, and living life in the public eye", "authors": ["Rosanna Greenstreet"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6535462c9adade146f535f9001baf256fc8134f3/2658_664_2378_1426/master/2378.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3751cf61ffa8e335eb6e988e8abf2aae", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
