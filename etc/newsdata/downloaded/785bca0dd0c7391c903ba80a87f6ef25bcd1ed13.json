The launch is yet another example of the eased tensions between the two rivals, who finally came to an agreement to support each other\u2019s streaming media services on their respective platforms.\n\nWith the new Amazon Music app for Fire TV, customers will gain access to millions of songs and thousands of playlists and stations, including Amazon Music\u2019s version of Spotify\u2019s \u201cRap Caviar,\u201d which it calls \u201cRap Rotation.\u201d Users will also be able to browse and search music from their favorite artists, as well as access all their purchased and imported music available in their \u201cMy Music\u201d library, says Amazon.\n\nThis latest launch follows the debut of Apple Music on Fire TV back in March, and is now one of several examples of the two companies playing nice with one another.\n\nLast year, for example, Amazon expanded its assortment of Apple inventory to include other devices besides Apple TV \u2014 like iPads, iPhones, Apple Watch and Beats headphones. It also brought its FreeTime Unlimited app to iOS. Meanwhile, Apple Music arrived on Echo devices last year.\n\nPlus, you\u2019ve been able to watch Amazon Prime Video on Apple TV since December 2017. And with the upcoming Apple TV+ streaming service, Apple promises a cross-platform experience, which includes Fire TV.\n\nBut the new app\u2019s launch is notable for another reason, as well.\n\nApple today is in the crosshairs of several antitrust investigations worldwide, including in the E.U., Russia, and the U.S.\n\nSpotify, in particular, has been calling out Apple for its alleged anti-competitive behavior, like charging the so-called \u201cApple tax\u201d on Spotify\u2019s in-app subscriptions when it sells a rival service with Apple Music, or for having too much control over if and when Spotify can release app updates. As a part of Apple\u2019s defense, it\u2019s been showcasing how it allows competitors on its platform.\n\nThe addition of Amazon Music to Apple TV will be another example it can now point to, alongside the arrival of Spotify to Apple TV just a few days ago.\n\nThe new Amazon Music app is live in the Apple TV App Store in the U.S., UK, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Canada, France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Mexico, Japan, and India.", "description": "Amazon Music is now available on the Apple TV, including both the Apple TV 4K and the Apple TV HD running tvOS 12.0 or later, Amazon announced this morning.
