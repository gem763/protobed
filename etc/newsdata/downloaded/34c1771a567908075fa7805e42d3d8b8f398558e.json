It ensured the Polish striker matched Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's Bundesliga record of scoring in each of the first eight games of the season. The former Dortmund striker managed it in 2015. Lewandowski also became the first to score in eight consecutive league games for Bayern since Dutch forward Roy Makaay in 2005.\n\nBayern's first-half performance was marred by many small mistakes, though both sides missed good chances to score.\n\nGnabry made no mistake four minutes into the second half with a fine individual goal, but the visitors were stunned again when Sergio Cordova set up Finnbogason's late leveler.\n\nThere was further bad news for Niko Kovac's team as defender Niklas S\u00fcle was forced off early with an injury and left the dressing room on crutches.\n\nBayern began the game with former Germany forward Thomas M\u00fcller on the bench for the sixth consecutive game, while midfielder Javi Mart\u00ednez started for the first time this season.\n\nUNION WINS\n\nUnion Berlin ended a run of four defeats by beating Freiburg 2-0 at home thanks to goals from Marius B\u00fclter and Marcus Ingvartsen.\n\nB\u00fclter got the home side off to a flying start when he let fly inside the top right corner in the second minute, while sealed the result with a fine dipping shot under the crossbar in the 84th.\n\nLeipzig was held 1-1 at unbeaten Wolfsburg, Hertha Berlin came back to draw 1-1 at Werder Bremen and Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf defeated 10-man Mainz 1-0.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nCiar\u00e1n Fahey on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cfaheyAP\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
