By the way, J.Hannah nail polish has an amazing \"Eames\" color that's a highly-pigmented mossy green.\n\nRoyal reds\n\nRed is an essential color that tends to transcend seasons. Deep, rich oxblood tones took center stage during New York Fashion Week Fall/Winter 2019. Duri's latest launched nail polish collection includes a gorgeous, glossy high-impact red called Humble Brag.\n\nAnimal prints\n\nSure, it's not a color, but artsy cheetah print nails have been popping up all over Instagram. If you aren't ready to sport a full hand of animal print, take baby steps with a fun accent nail.\n\nWarm Toffee\n\nWarm toffee hues were another Fall Fashion Week winner, and will absolutely elevate any outfit you are wearing during the season. Try Mented Cosmetics' Yes We Tan nude nail shade and prepare to be mesmerized.\n\nMust-have metallics\n\nThere's lots of holiday fun in the final months of the year. Instead of the usual glitter-filled nail color, go for a glowing metallic that's slightly more subtle, still very festive and easier to remove.", "description": "Check out five of the trendiest nail colors for Fall 2019.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/nail1-gty-ml-190916_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
