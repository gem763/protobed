In other words, spend, spend, spend.\n\nWhat a contrast with a few years ago, when the focus was on cuts.\n\nThe Conservatives argue that is because the public finances can now support a new approach.\n\nBut vast uncertainty still swirls around Brexit - and what it might mean for the national balance sheet.\n\nSince the start of this conference, the party has fleshed out details on how it will spend more than \u00a350bn.\n\nChancellor Sajid Javid will later make his contribution to this tally with promises on roads, buses and broadband.\n\nThe chancellor will say the full benefits of his infrastructure investment \"may not be felt for some time\", but \"the work must start here and now\".\n\nThe \u00a325bn pot had already been set aside provisionally by his predecessor, Philip Hammond, but Mr Javid will confirm it will be spent on upgrades for 14 of England's major roads, including:\n\nCompleting the dualling of the A66 Trans-Pennine expressway and the A46 Newark bypass\n\nImproving the M60 Simister Island interchange in Manchester\n\nStarting construction on the A428 to improve journeys between Cambridge and Milton Keynes and widening the A12 in east England\n\nAt least \u00a35bn will also be set aside to maintain and renew other strategic roads between 2020 and 2025.\n\nThe chancellor will renew a pledge made earlier this month to invest \u00a3220m into improved bus services in England, including \u00a350m for the country's first all-electric bus town or city.\n\nAnd he will set a goal for contactless payments to be made available on every city bus.\n\nPlans for so-called superbus networks, where local authorities will invest in bus lanes in exchange for more services from operators, will also be announced. A pilot is planned for Cornwall in 2020.\n\nImage copyright PA Media\n\nOther promises unveiled on Monday include:\n\nA \u00a35bn investment to support the roll-out of gigabit-capable internet, and mobile networks - including 5G.\n\nAn ambition to connect the hardest-to-reach 20% of the country - upping the earlier target of 10% - but a deadline to reach this goal has not been confirmed.\n\nA pledge by Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick to give tenants in new housing association properties the right to shared ownership of their home.\n\nPlans to create a simpler planning system to speed up the building of new homes.\n\nLabour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, accused the Tories of only offering \"a combination of re-announcements and damp squibs\".\n\nHe added the announcements showed \"the real difference between the parties\" with the Tories were \"tinkering around the edges, while Labour was proposing a fundamental shift of power and wealth from the few to the many\".", "description": "The chancellor holds out the prospect of tax cuts, as the PM faces more questions about his conduct.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07ppmjg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
