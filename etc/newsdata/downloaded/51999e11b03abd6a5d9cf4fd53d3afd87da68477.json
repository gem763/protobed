The drop in HPH Trust Kwai Tsing's throughput was mainly due to the decrease in intra-Asia and transshipment cargoes,\" it said.\n\nThe trust derives some 68 per cent of its revenue from China, and the remainder from Hong Kong.\n\nIn Hong Kong, HPH Trust operates Hongkong International Terminals, Cosco-HIT Terminals and Asia Container Terminals. In mainland China, HPH Trust operates YICT and Huizhou International Container Terminals.\n\nLooking ahead, the trust expects global trade to be sluggish on the back of intensifying trade tensions, slowing manufacturing and business activities, and elevated geopolitical and economic risks and uncertainties.\n\n\"While the bilateral trade talk between the US and China resumed, it is not expected that the trade dispute can be fully resolved shortly and will continue to weigh on HPH Trust's performance.\n\n\"Given the uncertainties in the global trade outlook, HPH Trust management remains cautious about future cargo trends and will continue to adhere to cost discipline and efficiency improvements in order to face the challenges ahead,\" it said.\n\nIt also believes that the continued deployment of mega vessels will necessitate investment in port facilities and continuous process improvements by deepwater port operators.\n\nUnits of HPH Trust closed one US cent lower at US$0.157 on Friday.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Companies & Markets - HUTCHISON Port Holdings Trust (HPH Trust) on Friday posted a 2.9 per cent drop in profit attributable to unitholders to HK$232.5 million (S$40.4 million) for its third quarter ended Sept 30 due to higher taxation. .
