Sissi launches her partner into the air, setting her up for a perfect backflip.\n\nSouth Island School synchronised swimmer Haruka Kawazoe tells us why it's hard to make her passion into a career in HK\n\nIt was hard for audiences at the Fina World Youth Artistic Swimming Championships 2019 to take their eyes off the dynamic duo, as they danced with effortless grace in the water.\n\nWhat the audiences did not see, however, was the real show beneath the surface.\n\nThe Chinese mixed duet put on a display of exceptional athleticism underwater, where they held their breath, kept their eyes open and used eggbeater kicks and sculling, moving their hands to propel their bodies, to support their balletic grace above the water.\n\nSissi said it is the artistic swimmer\u2019s job to make their routine look effortless.

Although she didn\u2019t go home with any shiny medals, Sissi felt it was an honour to represent her country at a top-tier competition.\n\n\u201cI knew we wouldn\u2019t come in first place, so we didn\u2019t think too much and just did our best,\u201d Sissi tells Young Post in a telephone interview.\n\nThe 14-year-old was introduced to synchronised swimming, also known as artistic swimming, when she was nine. With a strong background in swimming, many of her friends thought the discipline would be easy for Sissi to pick up, but she was quick to correct them, saying the Olympic sport requires skills from three separate fields \u2013 swimming, of course, but also gymnastics and ballet.\n\nSync or swim? Synchronised swimmer Christie Poon from GSIS can do both\n\n\u201cSometimes, people think my sport is easy, because synchronised swimmers are always smiling,\u201d Sissi says.\n\n\u201cTruth is, in order to get high scores, we have to smile to make it look easy.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese national team, which has won medals in the last three Olympic Games, is known for its intense training format and strict discipline.\n\nA member of the Shenzhen city team, Sissi admits not everyone can handle the taxing and stressful training schedule, which is typically 15 hours per week, but it can go up to 48 hours a week during her school holidays.\n\nSissi Li (right) and her partner represented China at the Fina World Youth Artistic Swimming Championships this year.

One time, her coach was so upset at her mistakes that she threw a metal chair into the pool, and made Sissi pick it up.\n\n\u201cMy coaches are really tough; a lot of my teammates had great potential but stopped training because they couldn\u2019t handle the pressure,\u201d says Sissi.\n\n\u201cBut I know they\u2019re being strict for us to improve, so I won\u2019t give up easily.\u201d\n\nThe teen\u2019s tenacity and talent caught the attention of the Guangdong regional team, which has recruited Sissi several times before. But since regional team athletes have to train on a full-time basis, Sissi had to turn down the offer because she wants to continue her education at Harrow International School Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong teen swimmer Natalie Kan has the 2020 Tokyo Olympics in her sights\n\nThe Year 10 student transferred to the school four years ago, as she felt like the international schools in Shenzhen did not suit her. She stays in the boarding school in Tuen Mun, and returns home on Tuesday and Friday for her practice. While travelling back and forth between the neighbouring cities is tiring, Sissi knows it is a sacrifice worth making.\n\n\u201cSometimes I\u2019m quite jealous of my friends because they have so much free time, but I know I have to compromise if I want to go to school and do synchronised swimming at the same time,\u201d she said.\n\nWith the competition season coming to an end, Sissi can loosen up a little and dedicate more time to her schoolwork (and maybe leisure time). She won\u2019t stop practising completely though, as she has set out to make the representative list to join the junior and senior world championships in five years\u2019 time.\n\n\u201cI really love the sport and I know I have the talent to do it at a high level,\u201d Sissi says.\n\n\u201cThe World Championships is definitely the competition I want to take part in at least once in my career.\u201d", "description": "Travelling between Hong Kong and Shenzhen for training is exhausting, but it's all for the love of the sport.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/668741e6-f540-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6imagehires112255.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
