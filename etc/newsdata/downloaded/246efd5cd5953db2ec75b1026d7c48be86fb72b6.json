David Pollard reports.\n\nA Vietnamese woman has been deported for failing to declare more than 4.5kg of pork, as authorities desperately try to protect our borders from African swine fever.\n\nBiosecurity officers punted the 45-year-old from Sydney on Saturday after 10kg of squid, quail and cooked pork products were found in her luggage.\n\n\u201cIf you are travelling from an African swine fever country - we are watching you,\u201d Agriculture Minister Bridget McKenzie told reporters in Canberra on Tuesday.\n\nAfrican swine fever is an incurable disease which kills pigs but is not harmful to humans.\n\nSenator McKenzie said Australia must protect its disease-free status, with swine fever decimating herds as it sweeps across Asian nations.\n\nThe minister also thanked Suki - a Darwin-based biosecurity dog that polices flights from Dili after the disease was found in East Timor.\n\nShe also had a message for visitors coming from nations affected by African swine fever.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t ask for your favourite meal, don\u2019t ask for your favourite meat treat or don\u2019t ask mum to cook you her favourite sausage and bring it over in her handbag,\u201d Senator McKenzie said.\n\n\u201cYou will be subject to the full force of our biosecurity regime because we are not going to take any risks with our agricultural platform, our pork producers and letting African swine fever into Australia.\u201d", "description": "A Vietnamese woman has been deported for failing to declare more than 4.5kg of pork, as authorities desperately try to protect our borders from African swine fever.", "authors": ["Matt Coughlan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/11141de2c0db828a08fc3af8ea35d4e0?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
