They were swimming in the hotel pool when a staff member called police who later maced Stroye before wrestling him to the ground during his arrest\n\nWhen asked about Nucera\u2019s being convicted of lying to the FBI, Cipparone said it was \u2018the lesser of three evils.\u2019\n\n\u2018I was hoping that it was not guilty, but we\u2019re going to see what happens tomorrow as well,\u2019 Cipparone said.\n\n\u2018It is what it is, and I have to accept it.\u2019\n\nKugler said that Nucera will be sentenced on February 6. Lying to the FBI carries with it a maximum prison sentence of five years.\n\nThe Nucera case made headlines nationally three years ago when allegations emerged that he slammed Stroye\u2019s head into a metal doorjamb while he was in handcuffs.\n\nDash cam video from September 2016 shows the moments before Stroye (center) was allegedly assaulted by Nucera (who is not seen in the dash cam footage)\n\nIn September 2016, Stroye and his girlfriend were with her aunt, uncle, and three young cousins when they rented a hotel room at a Ramada in Bordentown before Stroye was later accused of also renting, but refusing to pay $65 for a separate room.\n\nHe and his girlfriend were swimming in the hotel pool when a staff member called police who later maced Stroye, whose family says he suffers from chronic asthma, before wrestling him to the ground during his arrest.\n\nNucera was one of the officers who responded to a call for backup.\n\nStroye told the Philadelphia Enquirer the chief shoved his head into a glass door while he was in handcuffs and being escorted to a patrol car.\n\nHe said Nucera also slammed his head against the patrol car's door as Stroye was being placed inside.\n\nStroye was charged with resisting arrest, assault on an officer, and theft after the incident.\n\nHe ultimately took a plea deal, agreeing to serve 180 days in jail and two years probation for the officer assault charge in exchange for the other charges being dropped.\n\nDash cam footage shows Stroye being led away in handcuffs from the hotel and placed in the back of a police car, but Nucera is never seen in the video.\n\nAfter the incident, one of Nucera's fellow officers recorded him making many racist comments about African Americans over the course of a year, court records show.\n\nProsecutors said Nucera had a 'significant history' of spewing racist venom against blacks.\n\nHalf of the officers in his department have recorded him making racist comments, according to CBS News.\n\nAfter the incident, audio tapes surfaced in which Nucera (above) is heard making racist remarks about African Americans. Half of the officers in Nucera's department recorded him making the comments\n\nOne of the whistleblower cops said the former chief, who abruptly retired after the hotel incident, referred to the teens in Stroye's group using racial slurs after learning they were from Trenton, New Jersey, a city known for high crime, saying, 'Stay the f--- out of Bordentown.'\n\n'I'm tired of them, man,' Nucera said during the recording, according to court records. 'I'll tell you what, it's getting to the point where I could shoot one of these mother f****rs. And that n****r b***h lady, she almost got it.'\n\nThe same officer recorded Nucera making racist comments in November of 2015 after the ex-chief suspected a black man of slashing tires on a police vehicle.\n\n'These n****rs are like ISIS, they have no value,' Nucera said in the recording.\n\n'They should line them all up and mow 'em down. I'd like to be on the firing squad, I could do it. I used to think about if I could shoot someone or not, I could do it, I'm tired of it.'\n\nThree months after the incident, Nucera was secretly taped while being interviewed by the FBI.\n\nDuring the interview, Nucera denied that he had anything to do with Stroye's arrest.\n\nHe also told the FBI that he had no knowledge of any officer using excessive force against Stroye.", "description": "A jury convicted Frank Nucera Jr (left), 62, in federal court in Camden, New Jersey on Wednesday for lying to the FBI in connection with the September 2016 arrest of Timothy Stroye (right).", "authors": ["Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/23/19562034-0-image-a-7_1570746337945.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
