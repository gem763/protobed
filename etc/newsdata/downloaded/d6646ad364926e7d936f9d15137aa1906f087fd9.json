Love Island 2019: Most memorable fashion moments 1/15 When wedding dresses were destroyed, episode 12 While we're not exactly fans of the sexist 'Bridezilla' concept - seeing the female islanders squirt scarlet ketchup at one another in optic white wedding dresses was a sight we won't be forgetting anytime soon. And who knows, given the influence of Love Island, ketchup splattered dresses could be the next big thing in bridal trends. Rex Features 2/15 When white skinny jeans made a double appearance, episode 5 White skinny jeans are a staple look among the men in the Love Island villa, the reason for which remains a mystery. We're not sure who said sausage-tight white jeans were a good look, but the message has clearly spread, as not one but two islanders, Joe and Anton, were spotted donning the look in this episode with pride. Rex Features 3/15 When Belle wore belts as a top, episode 24 Traditionally, belts are worn to hold up trousers. But Belle offered an innovative new take on the accessory when she wore not one, but two belts around her midriff - and they weren't holding up anything at all. Instead, their purpose was purely aesthetic. It's a creative twist on the traditional crop top, one that might raise eyebrows on the tube, but turns heads in the Love Island villa. Rex Features 4/15 When Elma and Maura meant business, episode 9 The look in their eyes says it all, really. Elma and Maura arrived in the villa and clearly meant business. While Elma chose a scarlet cowl neck cocktail dress, Irish Samantha Jones-type Maura chose a white halterneck frock. The whole thing was very devil vs angel. Rex Features 5/15 When Curtis tried to do an Ovie, episode 31 Ovie Soko became renowned for his Hawaiian shirts in the villa, prompting some islanders to try and emulate his signature look. Curtis Pritchard was one of them. The professional dancer's efforts were commendable, but few can compete with Soko's suave. Perhaps that's why he looks so downtrodden here. ITV 6/15 When drama unfolded in neon, episode 22 The neon party was off to a roaring start, until a shock dumping saw two islanders booted out of the villa. Amber, Lucie and Molly-Mae were understandably shocked by the news. Or perhaps they came across a mirror and were blinded by the iridescence of their outfits. Rex Features 7/15 When Michael donned specs and stripes, episode 25 Michael might've made more enemies than friends during his time in the Love Island villa thanks to his treatment of Amber, but the firefighter did do one thing right when he paired a retro striped shirt with round spectacles. It's the kind of look that wouldn't have looked out of place on the stylish shores of the French Riviera in 1957. At least he did something right. ITV 8/15 When Curtis wore sparkly pink hotpants, episode 33 No, we're not sure what Curtis was thinking either when he decided to emerge inside the villa wearing a feathered headdress and pink sparkly hotpants. Perhaps he had taken style notes from King Julien in Madagascar. Or, maybe he was offering viewers a taste of how he chooses to dress outside of the Love Island villa. He donned the flamboyant ensemble to perform his dance as part of the heart rate challenge, and it's one we'll be trying to erase from our memories for the foreseeable future. ITV 9/15 When Ovie turned the nation's head, episode 33 This is another look from the heart rate challenge that the nation won't be forgetting in the near future, though perhaps the reasons are different. Ovie's camouflage look prompted thousands of viewers to gush over the professional basketball player on Twitter. Naturally, he wore one of his signature hats for the performance. ITV 10/15 When Curtis wore a kimono, episode 44 Another memorable Curtis moment was when he wore a floral kimono during a romantic exchange with partner Maura Higgins. We think it suits him, actually. ITV 11/15 When Penny-Sue Tinkerbell wore sunglasses, episode 45 The Love Island baby challenge brought out the best in Harley and Chris, whose child, named Penny-Sue Tinkerbell, made her on-camera debut in these stylish red shades. ITV 12/15 When Ovie matched his bucket hat to his baby, episode 45 Of course Ovie's baby was always going to be the trendiest infant in the villa. The child arrived in its toy cot wearing a bucket hat not dissimilar from the ones Ovie has frequently worn throughout the series. Like father, like son. ITV 13/15 When Ovie wore a Hawaiian shirt and hat combo for the 20th time, episode 46 Ovie's Hawaiian shirts could quite easily have their own spin-off show. Here, he pairs a black and white variation with a classic sun hat. Even without a ray of sunshine in sight (Ovie wore the look for an evening date) he still manages to look as polished and on trend as ever. ITV 14/15 When Chris wore a towel on his head... and two pairs of glasses, episode 47 It's not every day that you see a man embrace the art of grooming quite as enthusiastically as Chris. The heavily-tattooed islander was frequently seen in the villa sporting a towel on his head to protect his quiff. But he outdid himself here, by completing his beauty queen look by wearing not one, but two pairs of glasses. A true style icon. ITV 15/15 When Molly-Mae had her Beauty and the Beast moment, episode 54 When Molly-Mae sashayed down the steps in a sunshine yellow gown for her final date with Tommy Fury, she looked every part the Disney princess. It was an apt choice for the romantic evening ahead.

ITV\n\nBut the ASA said online age is often \u201cmisreported\u201d and said it \u201chad not been provided with details of any further steps Boohoo had taken to reduce the likelihood of under-18s being targeted with the ad\u201d.\n\nThe ASA ruled that because the advertisement was aimed at a relatively young audience, who it said \u201cwere more likely to be harmfully affected by pressure to share sexual images of themselves\u201d, it considered the reference to \u201csend nudes\u201d to be in breach of its code.\n\nMissguided\u2019s now-banned advertisement featured on ITV Hub during Love Island in June. It opened with a close-up of a woman\u2019s mouth holding a strawberry between her lips before going on to show a young woman in swimwear on a boat while on-text screen read: \u201cIf you plan on wearing clothes this summer \u2026 we\u2019ve got you covered \u2026 kind of\u201d.\n\nThe advertisement went on to show a young woman on the beach with her legs apart in what the ASA described as \u201cseductive poses\u201d.\n\nMissguided said that its advertisement was aimed at promoting a certain type of lifestyle and had intended to empower young women by showing them as confident. It added that images such as the strawberry between the lips were \"merely motifs used to create the lifestyle brand.\"\n\nThe online fashion brand also said the advertisement was \u201cnot overly different to images one might see on a beach during summer months or that were used in any ad for a bikini\u201d.\n\nBut the ASA concluded that while some of the scenes were in keeping with those typical for advertisements for swimwear, those which showed women running their hands up and down their thighs and sitting astride motorbikes in thong bikinis were \u201csexually suggestive\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe did not therefore agree that the women in those scenes were presented as empowered, confident young women,\u201d the advertising watchdogs state.\n\n\u201cWe considered that the cumulative effect of the scenes meant that overall, the products had been presented in an overly-sexualised way that invited viewers to view the women as sexual objects.\u201d\n\nThe ASA also stated that some viewers might be \u201cseriously offended by advertising that presented women as sexual objects\u201d.\n\nIn January, Boohoo and Missguided were named as two of the least sustainable fashion brands in the UK in a report published by the Environmental Audit Committee.\n\nThe Independent has contacted Boohoo and Missguided for comment.", "description": "Two separate advertisements for Boohoo and Missguided have been banned by watch dogs, with the former being deemed \u201csocially irresponsible\u201d while the latter \u201cobjectified women\u201d.
