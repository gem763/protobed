A joint statement said both sides could see a \"pathway to a possible deal.\"\n\nThe E.U.'s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, then had what was described as a \"constructive meeting\" with the U.K.'s Brexit minister, Stephen Barclay.\n\nThe two sides will now proceed to the next stage of talks, jokingly referred to as entering \"the tunnel\" due to their arduous nature.\n\nThat means that negotiators can move on from the mostly theoretical discussions that have been taking place for the past few weeks and work toward a final agreement.\n\nHowever, president of the European Council Donald Tusk struck a cautious note Friday and pointed out that the U.K. has not yet proposed a deal that the 27 remaining members of the E.U. consider acceptable.\n\nThis is merely the latest in a complex, fast-moving storythat has seen the E.U. repeatedly rejectBritish proposals for what should happen to Northern Ireland after Brexit.\n\nNorthern Ireland is part of the U.K. but shares a land border with the Irish Republic, which remains a key E.U. member. Goods and people cross the border freely and without checks at the moment \u2014 one of the conditions of the Good Friday Agreement of 1998.\n\nLondon's complex workaround announced last week \u2014 and quickly dismissed by Irish leaders on both sides of the border \u2014 involved Northern Ireland remaining in the E.U.'s single market for goods, but bound by U.K. customs rules.\n\nThis posed a range of problems for the highly integrated all-Ireland economy and is further complicated by the question of how the Northern Ireland Assembly \u2014 which has been suspended since 2017 \u2014 would agree to such a system.\n\nWhat concessions the British have made in order to secure deeper talks also remain unclear.\n\nAnalysis\n\nAs it stands, the U.K. will leave the E.U. with or without a deal on Oct. 31. But a law passed by the British Parliament compels Johnson to ask the E.U. for a Brexit extension \u2014 something he has repeatedly said he doesn't want to do.\n\nIt would be the third Brexit extension to date and mark a huge defeat for Johnson's \"do or die\" promise of leaving on time.\n\nAnd most observers see next week's E.U. summit in Brussels as the last practical chance for Johnson to secure a withdrawal agreement and avoid an extension.", "description": "Time is running out to agree a deal before the Oct. 31 deadline for Britain to leave the European Union.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4225724/1000x563_nbc-191011_ps_brexit_barnier_barclay_1411_d5c8766fe946336e3e527cd1b450096a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
