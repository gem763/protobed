(Simon Dawson/Bloomberg News)\n\nWhen Phillip Lee walked across the carpeted green aisle in the House of Commons on Tuesday, the lawmaker instantly erased British Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s majority.\n\nWhen Lee strolled through an upscale shopping center in his home district days later, voters showed why Johnson thinks an election just might win it back.\n\n\u201cTraitor,\u201d hissed a woman in a blue sweater.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely disgusted with you,\u201d snapped another in a yellow raincoat.\n\nLee\u2019s dramatic defection from the Conservative Party was one of several indignities in the past week that have left Britain\u2019s once-swaggering prime minister staggering. Not only did Johnson lose his governing majority, he also fell short in a string of critical votes that could have cleared a path to the E.U. exit he has promised by Oct. 31. Even his brother abandoned him, quitting as a Conservative lawmaker and minister.\n\nYet if Johnson has any hope of righting his young premiership \u2014 and of delivering on his Brexit vows \u2014 analysts say he will need an election victory to stock Parliament with enough Conservatives willing to follow him over the cliff-edge of a no-deal departure.\n\n[Boris Johnson\u2019s statements about the state of Brexit negotiations bear little relationship to reality, E.U. officials say]\n\nAnd for that, he and his party will be targeting districts like Lee\u2019s to eliminate a contradiction that hard-line Brexiteers see at the heart of the United Kingdom\u2019s gridlock: A majority of Britons voted in 2016 to leave the European Union. But a majority of lawmakers, elected a year later, favored staying in.\n\nLee is among those who wanted Britain to remain, even though his constituents in this Tory-dominated region 30-some miles west of London leaned toward leaving. If he runs again, his old party will seek to capitalize on voter frustration with the interminable exit and challenge him with a candidate committed to \u201cgetting this done, even if it means no deal,\u201d said Gerry Barber, the local Conservative leader. \u201cNo more delays. No more shenanigans.\u201d\n\nJust getting to an election may require shenanigans aplenty. Johnson is expected to lose on Monday when he asks Parliament to support a vote, his second such defeat in as many weeks. With the opposition dismissing election calls as \u201ca trap,\u201d the prime minister may end up needing to resign before the voters can have their say.\n\nWhether it\u2019s weeks or months off, analysts say a new election is all but inevitable given Johnson\u2019s lack of a majority. And in Bracknell, all sides are already preparing for it.\n\nYet here, as is the case in districts nationwide, the calculus will be exceptionally tricky. The country remains polarized along the binary lines of leave or remain, with polls showing a nearly even divide three years after the referendum.\n\nBut an election would offer voters a full spectrum of options that will ensure that neither the pro- nor the anti-Brexit camp is fully united.\n\nSince Johnson became prime minister in late July, his Conservatives have opened up a significant lead over the opposition Labour Party. He\u2019s done that, analysts say, by winning back some of the disenchanted leave voters who had spurned the Tories for the nascent Brexit Party.\n\n\u201cGiven how volatile politics is at the moment, it won\u2019t take much for the Brexit Party to be a real problem for Boris,\u201d said Adam McDonnell, an analyst with the polling firm YouGov. \u201cSo his strategy is to really appeal to those leave voters, and especially those leave-at-any-cost voters.\u201d\n\nThe approach has come at the expense of a full-scale rupture among the Conservatives. The most successful party in British political history has been divided for decades over the country\u2019s membership in the E.U., with room both for fervent supporters and opponents.\n\nBut Johnson appears bent on a fundamental realignment, one that leaves little room for those who want to keep Britain in the world\u2019s largest trading bloc.\n\n\u201cIt feels like plate tectonics,\u201d said Lee, the pro-E.U. Tory who defected to the opposition Liberal Democrats on Tuesday. \u201cAnd I was straddling the divide.\u201d\n\nHad Lee not jumped, he would have been pushed. When, later on Tuesday, 21 other Conservative lawmakers defied the prime minister and voted with opposition parties to stave off a potential no-deal Brexit, Johnson purged them from the party. Those forced into exile included former top ministers, rising stars and Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson.\n\nLee, a 48-year-old medical doctor who was first elected to Parliament in 2010, chose to leave the Conservatives on his own terms \u2014 and in the most humiliating possible way for the prime minister, who in that instant lost his single-seat majority.\n\nJohnson was mid-speech when Lee crossed the aisle, provoking hoots of approval from the opposition benches and a perhaps not entirely sincere \u201cI wish my honorable friend all the best\u201d from the prime minister.\n\nIn a withering letter to Johnson, Lee wrote that the \u201cbroad political church\u201d he had joined as a young man had been transformed by Brexit into \u201csomething more akin to a narrow faction, where an individual\u2019s \u2018conservatism\u2019 is measured by how recklessly one wishes to leave the European Union.\u201d\n\nDays later, as Lee walked the stone-paved central shopping district in the town of Bracknell, some of his constituents congratulated him.\n\n\u201cWell done, sir,\u201d offered a street sweeper as he worked his rounds. \u201cYou did the right thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a man of integrity,\u201d said Chris Lovejoy, who stopped shopping long enough to shake Lee\u2019s hand. \u201cHe\u2019s working in the interests of the British people.\u201d\n\nOthers confronted him, irate that he had not fallen into line with Johnson \u2014 or with his constituents.\n\n\u201cThe right thing to do was to support your prime minister, support your party,\u201d Amanda Casbon, 50, angrily told her representative. \u201cWe voted to leave. We all need to get on board.\u201d\n\nCasbon told Lee she had voted for Brexit because she assumed that politicians, particularly Conservative ones, had a plan to get out. The Conservatives had called the referendum. Johnson and other top Tories had led the exit campaign. Weren\u2019t the Conservatives responsible for seeing it through?\n\n\u201cIt was your party!\u201d she shouted.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve left it,\u201d he told her. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a plan.\u201d\n\nLee was opposed to calling the referendum. But now he supports a second one to help undo what he sees as the grievous harm done to British democracy by the first. Above all, he wants to avoid what he regards as the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d damage that would befall the British economy if Britain exits without a deal.\n\n[Boris Johnson\u2019s no-deal Brexit could lead British lambs to slaughter]\n\nBracknell, a relatively prosperous area that is home to several major British companies, could be hit especially hard if economists\u2019 dire predictions about the consequences of a crash-out prove true.\n\nBut there is also strong local sentiment for an exit, and Lee acknowledges that his defection to the pro-E.U. Liberal Democrats could cost him his seat whenever there\u2019s an election. \u201cThis was not the move of a careerist,\u201d he said.\n\nBoth the Conservatives and the Brexit Party say they will run on a pledge to get Brexit done, come what may.\n\n\u201cThis has to stop,\u201d said David Winsper, an Army veteran who is running as the Brexit Party candidate here. \u201cIt\u2019s a complete omni-shambles in the House of Commons.\u201d\n\nWinsper, 47, long supported the Conservatives and said he voted for Lee in 2017. But, like Lee, he has defected \u2014 although for opposite reasons. He blames the Tories for dithering over Britain\u2019s departure.\n\nBrexit Party leader Nigel Farage has offered to strike an election pact with the Conservatives that could help to maximize the impact of the pro-leave vote. Winsper said such a deal \u201cwould deliver Boris Johnson and the Conservatives a thumping victory,\u201d and some analysts agree.\n\nFor now, Tories are cool to the idea. In an area that has voted Conservative for decades, they are confident they can flip the seat from a Brexit critic to a booster without help from a polarizing figure such as Farage.\n\nBut they also acknowledge that a lot of damage has been done along the way. In an office complex on the edge of town, the local Conservative Party and Lee continue to share a building. In the last election, they campaigned together. This time, they\u2019ll be on opposite sides of Britain\u2019s great divide.\n\n\u201cBrexit has torn relationships \u2014 friends, family,\u201d said Barber, the local Conservative leader.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all been torn asunder.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nBoris Johnson continues push for election as brother Jo Johnson resigns\n\nThree ways Boris Johnson could become Britain\u2019s shortest-serving prime minister\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Phillip Lee\u2019s seat is a must-win for the Tories if Johnson wants to deliver on his Brexit vows.", "authors": ["Griff Witte", "Roaming America After Years Overseas In Europe", "The Middle East", "South Asia", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/QJQRsxyjlMzZ6lWji9qfbZsR3pc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7J33NFGROEI6TB72QUA2IVWAAM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
