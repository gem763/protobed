The most popular type of home first-time buyers enquire about on Zoopla\u2019s portal are three-bedroom properties that they can grow into, rather than rushing into buying smaller, lower value homes in order to force their way onto the market.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Liz Lucking"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-104434?size=1.3544973544973544&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
