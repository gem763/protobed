Nobody \u2013 least of all Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s snivelling party entertainer \u2013 believed he stood a snowball\u2019s chance in hell. But his message hit home and the voters clamoured for change and we live in interesting times where the old rules don\u2019t apply.\n\nAs with the man, so with the film. Since its grand unveiling at the Venice film festival last weekend, Phillips\u2019s revisionist comic-book blockbuster - charting the formative years of Batman\u2019s nemesis - has had the critics worrying at it like a ham-bone tugged between a pack of dogs. It\u2019s been hailed as a fiery socialist call-to-arms and damned as a cynical instruction manual for incel vigilantes. It\u2019s been seen as left-wing; it\u2019s been seen as right-wing. Its politics are so turbulent, so unrefined - and yes, arguably garbled - that they sprawl and crawl beyond traditional party boundaries. Much, it might be said, as real-world politics has a tendency to do these days.\n\n\u201cIs it just me or is it getting crazier out there?\u201d asks Phoenix\u2019s antihero near the start of the film. And this was a question that - with variations - was being posed again and again on social media as Lucrecia Martel\u2019s Venice jury decided to hand the Golden Lion to Joker ahead of the numerous other, more favoured candidates. Most onlookers were fine with Martin Eden\u2019s brooding Luca Marinelli winning the best actor prize and Gloria Mundi\u2019s Ariane Ascaride being named best actress. And you could almost hear the collective sigh of satisfaction when the directing award went to Sweden\u2019s Roy Andersson for his inimitable About Endlessness. In any other year, the decision to lavish the Silver Lion \u2013 effectively the event\u2019s second prize \u2013 on the disgraced Roman Polanski for his historical thriller An Officer and a Spy would have provided the night\u2019s biggest controversy. Except that the jury had a final twist in store.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Phillips and Phoenix with their award.

Only insofar as Joker hardly needs the attention and there are other, smaller productions (off the top of my head: Pablo Larrain\u2019s Ema and Haifa al-Mansour\u2019s The Perfect Candidate) which would have benefited from a leg-up. But if the remit is to reward the competition\u2019s most bold and ambitious production, then why not Joker? Phillips\u2019s film is slippery, divisive and borderline irresponsible in its climactic call to arms. But it\u2019s also exuberant, exciting and at times genuinely radical \u2013 the sort of movie that takes a gleeful delight in pushing the envelope; in taking three steps further than you imagine it will. I loved the film when I saw it and it\u2019s been buzzing in my head ever since. Joker\u2019s set-up was fabulous and its punchline was devastating. But tonight\u2019s killing joke is what really brought the whole house down.\n\n\n\n", "description": "The victory for Todd Phillips\u2019s revisionist comic book blockbuster is a credit to a festival in touch with crazed politics, contemporary paranoia \u2013 and superb cinema", "authors": ["Xan Brooks"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49060c76130e65e7cfa4ab909d04d14329e98b57/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ffb20875d381faedb766f37529824085", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
