Before I had braces, my teeth stuck out and I was picked on by the boys.\n\n\u201cThe girls made fun of my thick, wavy hair, as Jennifer Aniston\u2019s poker straight locks were in fashion.\n\n\u201cI failed maths and science at school and got Cs in everything else.\n\n(Image: Susie Hasler)\n\n\u201cWhen I got to college, I reinvented myself, my style, became more confident, got a great group of friends and was regularly told off by the teachers for socialising more than working.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go to uni as I hated studying and didn\u2019t pass my exams with good enough grades.\u201d\n\nAfter starting an admin career at 18, Susie spent the next 12 years \"hating\" what she did for a living.\n\nNot only that, she was again being mocked for her sense of style.\n\nSusie said: \"It felt like I was being stifled and I felt terrified it would be my life forever. I had so much creativity and had no idea where to channel it.\n\n(Image: Susie Hasler)\n\n\"My last job in admin was for a male-dominated engineering company. I expressed my style when I worked in the office and got ribbed regularly by the many older men I worked with.\"\n\nConfessing she isn't \"academically gifted\" Susie feared she would fail as a businesswoman but made the brave step to quit the job she despised to strike out on her own.\n\nBy 2011 she had pulled together the \u00a31,500 she needed to study for a diploma in personal styling at the Style Coaching Institute in 2011.\n\nShe wanted to \u201chelp women feel good about their bodies and to bring personal style to women like me\u201d.\n\nAt 29, Susie gave birth to her son Clark and at six weeks old he caught whooping cough and almost died.\n\n(Image: Susie Hasler)\n\nSusie admits she found motherhood tough - and developed post-natal depression after Clark\u2019s brush with death.\n\nShe said: \"It was so hard and I felt out of my depth.\"\n\nEmotionally drained, Susie knew she didn\u2019t want to go back to work in an office so she took the leap to launch her own website, Styled By Susie .\n\nSusie said: \u201cI\u2019m not from a middle-class, privileged background and have no amazing connections; and I had to work very hard.\n\n\u201cI used to work for free to help build up my client base. I would work Friday evenings doing group styling, until 1am, and would be in Bluewater on a Saturday morning at 9am the next day.\n\n(Image: Susie Hasler)\n\n\u201cMy little boy was only 18 months and it was hard!\u201d\n\nBut her efforts paid off.\n\nHer clients - known as her \u2018tribe\u2019 - took to Facebook to praise her personal stylist sessions, and word soon spread.\n\nThe group now boasts 11,000 women from around the world who Susie has styled - or who are waiting for sessions to become available.\n\nNow, she only works four days a week during term-time and enjoys spending time with Clark and Tom during the school holidays.\n\nShe has also won a Best Stylist Award.\n\n(Image: Susie Hasler)\n\nSusie specialises in women on a budget whose bodies have changed shape - whether that\u2019s due to motherhood, the menopause, or losing or gaining weight.\n\nShe offers face-to-face styling sessions at Bluewater shopping centre, which cost \u00a3150 for three hours.\n\nBut she's so in demand she's booked up until Christmas next year.\n\nSusie also offers online consultations ranging from \u00a335 to \u00a385 to women from around the world.\n\nShe said: \u201cI empower women to dress for their shapes as they are and to shine to their full potential.\n\n(Image: Susie Hasler)\n\n\u201cI help clients of all shapes and sizes, and I work with realistic budgets and my clients like me because they can relate to me. I am not filtered, glossy or pretentious.\n\n\u201cIn a world of Instagram fashion influencers and celebrity stylists, I like to fly the flag for real women, and offering realistic style tips on achievable and affordable budgets.\u201d\n\nSusies expertise have already saved one teenager from being bullied and helped her to make a bold fashion choice.\n\nShe rushed to the teenager's rescue when her own friend told her she looked \"terrible\".\n\nSusie couldn't stop herself taking action when the girl's pal was even grabbing passers-by to get them to tell her how awful she looked in a pair of sunglasses.\n\n(Image: Susie Hasler)\n\nShe was out shopping at Bluewater when she overheard the insults and decided to step in.\n\nSusie said: \"\"I was in Primark and there were two girls who were trying on sunglasses.\n\n\"One of the girls - and with friends like this who needs enemies - was getting passers-by to get her friend how awful she looked.\n\n\"She was saying 'those glasses look awful, excuse me, can you tell my friend how terrible she looks'.\n\n\"I said 'excuse me, can I have a look?' She turned around and she was wearing high-fashion sunglasses, not to everyone\u2019s taste.\n\n\"And I said 'I\u2019m a personal stylist, and I think they look fab, and if you love them, you should get them'.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\"At which point, the friend said 'I think I\u2019m going to listen to the personal stylist\u2019s point of view'.\n\n\"And her friend said 'but I don\u2019t like them, I like the more classic styles'.\n\n\"I said to her, 'what about your friend? She likes these? She looks fab in them' - so she went and bought them.\"\n\nAnd Susie has a powerful message behind her intervention.\n\nShe said: \"Be careful who you surround yourself with and remember just because your friend doesn't like it doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have to buy it.\n\n\"Follow your own style intuition. And if I\u2019m nearby, I\u2019ll tell them off!\"", "description": "Susie Hasler, from West Sussex, launched her fashion blog when she was suffering from post-natal depression and is now booked up until December 2020", "authors": ["Carol Driver", "Jane Lavender", "Image", "Susie Hasler"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20545963.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_I-was-badly-bullied-at-school-but-now-Im-an-award-winning-fashion-blogger.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
