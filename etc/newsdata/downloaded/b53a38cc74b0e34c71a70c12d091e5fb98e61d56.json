The tragic high speed collision in 1999 that cost 31 lives On October 5, 1999, two trains collided at high speed close to Paddington station shortly after 8.10am, killing 31 people as a further 227 people were taken to hospital. The Thames Trains driver, Michael Hodder, 31, and the First Great Western (FGW) driver, Brian Cooper, 52, were among those killed as the collision led to a fireball in which coach H was burnt out. Rescue workers surround the wreckage of two trains which lie on rails in west London after a crash near Paddington Station on October 5, 1999 As well as the fatalities, more than 220 other people were injured, including Paddington Survivors Group chairman Jonathan Duckworth, now 61, from Stroud in Gloucestershire. Travelling on the FGW train, Mr Duckworth said he was left 'battered and bruised' after being thrown around the carriage during the crash, and later he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. The subsequent inquiry into the disaster revealed that the Thames service travelling from Paddington to Bedwyn in Wiltshire had gone through a red signal before crashing into the London-bound high-speed FGW train which had left Cheltenham Spa in Gloucestershire at 6.03am. The newly-qualified Thames driver, for reasons we will never know for he was one of those to perish in the crash, ignored warning horns blaring in his cab after running through two yellow signals, then a red, before impact.\n\nAfter the collision two decades ago, large fires broke out on the two trains and a significant effort was required to rescue those trapped in the wreckage, which later took eight days to clear.\n\nBrett Loft, a firefighter who was based in North Kensington at the time of the disaster, said: 'It's one of the biggest incidents we've attended on the railway in London, probably ever.\n\n'It was obviously a very traumatic day for everyone involved, we did all we could at the time.\n\n'I came on later in the incident to take over from those who got there in the beginning and they wouldn't leave until they had made sure they had rescued everyone that could be rescued.\n\n'The main memory I have from it was people's mobile phones ringing and obviously no-one there to pick them up, we didn't know if they had been taken to hospital or just misplaced their phone.\n\n'It took a good few months to get over what we had seen and done on that day and I just can't believe it was 20 years ago.'\n\nStressing that lessons had been learnt, the Government's rail minister said safety is 'hardwired into the DNA' of the country's network on the 20th anniversary of the rail crash.\n\nChris Heaton-Harris said the disaster was 'one of the most tragic rail accidents in recent times'.\n\nHe offered the Government's 'heartfelt sympathies' to those affected by the crash, which he said had 'fundamentally changed my view on how the railways work'.\n\n'If you don't learn from these disasters then you just have them again and again and again,' Mr Heaton-Harris said.\n\n'Our thoughts have to be with those who suffered injuries and the bereaved families as we approach the anniversary.'\n\nThe minister argued that the incident and other crashes had lead to 'positive' safety developments.\n\nThis included the creation of the Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB) in 2003, and the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) in 2005.\n\n'They were fundamental game changers in the way we review safety on our network,' Mr Heaton-Harris said.\n\nThe Tory MP recalled learning of the Paddington disaster and the earlier Clapham Junction crash in 1988, in which 35 people were killed.\n\nHe said: 'It was one of those moments where you knew someone who was on or you knew someone who knew someone who was on the train affected, or one of the people who was there to pick up the pieces.'\n\n'I can only remember the TV footage afterwards... which was unbelievably shocking. I don't think I'd ever seen anything quite like that,' he added.\n\n'I was living in south-west London at the time so the fact that these were London accidents brought it way closer to home.'\n\nMr Heaton-Harris said it was important to remember such rail crashes for the bereaved families and to ensure 'we don't have tragedies like these again'.\n\nThe minister highlighted that in 2018-19 there were almost 1.8 billion passenger journeys made on the country's rail network, with 1.4 fatalities per billion train kilometres recorded.\n\nBy comparison, in the same period, Spain recorded 89.2 fatalities per billion train kilometres recorded, Germany 11.4, France 7.2, with the overall EU average being 24.2.\n\nThe Government's rail minister, Chris Heaton-Harris (pictured), said the disaster was 'one of the most tragic rail accidents in recent times'\n\nAccording to the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), there were 17 passenger fatalities on the railway in 2018-19, up from nine in 2017-18, and the highest number for the last 10 years.\n\nThirteen of the passenger fatalities occurred on the mainline and four on the London Underground, with none being the result of a train accident.\n\nThe ORR has identified a 'worrying rise' in the number of Signals Passed at Danger (SPADs) given a 'potentially severe' ranking, from 10 in 2017-18 to 16 in 2018-19.\n\nIt said the figures were low and it is too early to know if the rise is significant, but emphasised that SPADs would be a priority for ORR inspections in 2019-20.\n\nRSSB research indicates that more trains on the network and declining punctuality levels mean drivers are seeing more red signals, which increases the opportunity for SPADs.\n\nMr Heaton-Harris acknowledged that there were still 'plenty of lessons to learn' and the need to 'maintain vigilance'.\n\nHe pointed to the death of two rail workers killed by a train while carrying out engineering work for Network Rail on the line near Port Talbot, South Wales, in July.\n\nAn interim report by Network Rail said there was no official lookout in place to give warning of oncoming trains on the morning the two men died.\n\nMr Heaton-Harris said the incident 'should absolutely not have happened', adding: 'We need to learn from every single incident and ensure that they don't happen again.'\n\nAsked what the Government was doing to improve safety, he highlighted plans to introduce new safer rolling stock and the ongoing 'root and branch' rail network review lead by Keith Williams, former chief executive of British Airways.\n\n'It is the most significant change in the rail sector in 25 years and its going to lead to a white paper and legislation and a different way of running the railways,' Mr Heaton-Harris said.\n\nThe review is due publish its findings and recommendations in the autumn this year.\n\nReflecting the impact of past rail crashes Mr Heaton-Harris said: 'We do have, because safety is now almost fundamentally hardwired into the DNA of everybody connected with the railways, a much safer rail network.'\n\nHe added: 'We have learnt from them and it does mean that we have one of the highest standards of safety when it comes to railways across Europe, if not the world, for passengers, workers and the public.'", "description": "On October 5, 1999, two trains collided at high speed close to Paddington station shortly after 8.10am, killing 31 people as a further 227 people were taken to hospital.", "authors": ["James Wood For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/15/19334282-0-image-a-14_1570284527232.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
