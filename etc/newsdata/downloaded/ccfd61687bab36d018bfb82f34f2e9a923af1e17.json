SBW should\u2019ve started, and lineout target backfired with England dominating turnovers.

THE most physical of games! At the end of the game.... respect shown by both sides and congratulatory hand shakes..... followed by a guard of honour by each team.

Our players made a commitment to each other that they\u2019d enjoy the World Cup and I think we\u2019re seeing that.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s actually been a trend for English sides this year with the cricket side also claiming the World Cup for the first time.\n\nWhile it is the fourth time England have made the Rugby World Cup final, it would be the second title for the nation if they were able to lift the trophy next Saturday night.\n\nBut the parallels between the cricket and rugby triumphs were clear, with the Barmy Army dropping a slice of gold on Twitter to celebrate the victory.\n\nIt came as the world reacted the result.\n\nFormer English rugby stars were all for it.\n\nImmense!! Individually and together as a team....immense! On to next week's final. Can't wait! \u2014 Jonny Wilkinson (@JonnyWilkinson) October 26, 2019\n\nThe greatest 41st birthday ever ...

Come On England. \u2014 Gary Lineker (@GaryLineker) October 26, 2019\n\nBut not all are happy with the bandwagon fans with former One Direction star Niall Horan slamming the fairweather supporters.\n\nThe thoughts of listening to so called English rugby fans now, makes me sick. \u2014 Niall Horan (@NiallOfficial) October 26, 2019\n\nThey are phenomenal. One of the best performances I\u2019ve seen in a long time but...... the fans will be unbearable \u2014 Niall Horan (@NiallOfficial) October 26, 2019\n\nHansen selection of Barrett at 6 isn't working. England tight five hammering NZ with unbelievable defense but also offering so much going forward. Ford has options everywhere. Impressive #ENGvNZL \u2014 Darren Waters (@darrenwaters) October 26, 2019\n\nSKIPPER\u2019S NOW ICONIC SMIRK\n\nThe haka stare down was a brilliant piece of theatre to start the game with England illegally walking over the halfway line in a V formation.\n\nThe haka drama also delivered one of the iconic images of the World Cup, with English skipper Owen Farrell smirking at the All Blacks\u2019 traditional war dance.\n\nBBC reporter James Waterhouse said on Twitter it \u201cwill age brilliantly. Or terribly.\u201d\n\nTurns out it worked out alright for the Poms.\n\nAfter the match, Farrell said his side wanted to get in their faces.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to just stand there and let them come at us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted to keep a respectful distance, but we didn\u2019t want to stand in a flat line and let them come at us.\u201d\n\nThis was actually brilliant, and part of the psychological warfare that the Haka represents. #AllBlacks taken aback. Our boys make own visual, V for Victory. Owen Farrell\u2019s confident, amused face. Undermined NZ before the whistle even blew. https://t.co/cvj2xW3J2u \u2014 Louise Mensch (@LouiseMensch) October 26, 2019\n\nThe moment I saw Owen Farrell smirk at the haka I knew it would be England\u2019s day.
