It all goes to show that, sometimes, it\u2019s better not to say anything.\"\n\nHowever, a statement issued after that interview stated that any claim Mr Johnson had taken cocaine was \"simply untrue\".\n\nHe was asked to clear up the confusion during his leadership campaign launch, to which he replied: \"I think the account of this event when I was 19 has appeared many, many times.\n\n\"I think what most people in this country want us to really focus on in this campaign, if I may say so, is what we can do for them and what our plans are for this great country of ours.\"\n\nAsked whether he had ever done anything illegal, Mr Johnson said: \"I cannot swear that I have always observed a top speed limit of 70mph.\"\n\n3 Will this affect the contenders for No 10?\n\nHow the past drug use of the 10 candidates vying for the top job will impact their chances is unclear, although Mr Gove's campaign has been overshadowed by the issue.\n\nThe question of drug use is unlikely to sway a significant number of Tory MPs, who will be tasked with whittling down the crowded field to just two.\n\nBut the 100,000-plus Tory party members, who will be casting the deciding votes before the winner is announced later in July, may be more profoundly influenced by what has emerged in the last two weeks.", "description": "The past drug use of Tory leadership hopefuls has become an unlikely theme of the race to succeed Theresa May.
