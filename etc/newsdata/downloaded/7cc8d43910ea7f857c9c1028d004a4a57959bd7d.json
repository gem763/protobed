The UK proposals do not match even remotely what was agreed as a sufficient compromise in the backstop,\u201d the committee said.\n\n\u201cThe Brexit steering group does not find these last-minute proposals of the UK government of 2 October, in their current form, represent a basis for an agreement to which the European parliament could give consent. The proposals do not address the real issues that need to be resolved, namely the all-island economy, the full respect of the Good Friday Agreement, and the integrity of the single market.\u201d\n\nThe parliament has three main concerns with the proposals: it says plans for customs checks represent \u201ca serious risk to the peace process\u201d in Ireland; that the half-finished nature of the plans \u201cdo not provide the necessary certainty\u201d; and that the veto given to Stormont \u201cmakes an agreement contingent, uncertain, provisional\u201d and subject to a unilateral decision.\n\n\u201cThe question is: is this a serious compromise? And we have serious doubts about that, certainly after the leak of a paper, a document, by Downing Street to the Tory MPs to blame the European Union directly,\u201d Mr Verhofstadt told Channel 4 News.\n\n\u201cIf there is a Tory document saying that they have to blame the European Union then it\u2019s obvious that that is the purpose ... The backstop is in fact a safeguard that is a type of insurance that you never hope to use. That\u2019s a backstop. And this is quite the opposite, what is proposed. It\u2019s temporary, so it\u2019s not for a long period. It\u2019s depending on the consent of an assembly in Northern Ireland that, for three years, has not been seated, was never in place. And there are serious doubts that it will be in place in the coming years.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in Ireland\u2019s parliament on Thursday, the country\u2019s deputy prime minister Simon Coveney echoed EU concerns about the customs checks and built-in veto for the Northern Ireland Assembly.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It is not something we could possibly support as part of any final deal.\u201d\n\nHe added that there were \u201clegal and technical\u201d problems with the plan, stating: \u201cDespite this paper saying they want to avoid customs checks, they do raise the prospect of customs checks somewhere, not just in premises and businesses, and we think that\u2019s going to be a real problem.\u201d\n\nMr Coveney expressed hope that the plan could be developed into something that was \u201cfit for purpose\u201d and be a starting point for negotiations. Leo Varadkar later told reporters at a press conference that having two customs zones on the island of Ireland was \u201cgoing to create a real difficulty that\u2019s going to be very hard to reconcile\u201d.\n\nThe UK proposals do not match even remotely what was agreed as a sufficient compromise in the backstop European Parliament Brexit Steering Group\n\nBack in Brussels, a spokesperson for the European Commission warned that it was down to the UK to fix the \u201cproblematic\u201d aspects of the proposals.\n\nAsked whether Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay was right to say that the ball was \u201cin the EU\u2019s court\u201d following the release of the policy on Wednesday, a spokesperson for the European Commission said the EU would not be left \u201cholding the bag\u201d and that it was the UK that needed to act.\n\n\u201cWe would disagree.\u201d she told reporters in Brussels. \u201cThere are, as we have said, problematic points in the United Kingdom\u2019s proposal and further work is needed \u2013 but that work needs to be done by the United Kingdom and not the other way around.\n\n\u201cWe would remind you that it\u2019s the UK leaving the European Union and not the EU leaving the UK.\n\n\u201cWe are doing everything in our power to ensure that exit is on an orderly basis and we are willing to engage constructively with our counterparts. But we are not going to be the ones left holding the bag, the ball, or any other kind of object.\u201d\n\nEuropean Council president Donald Tusk said on Thursday: \u201cMy message to taoiseach Leo Varadkar: We stand fully behind Ireland. My message to prime minister Boris Johnson: We remain open but still unconvinced.\u201d\n\nAn initial polite but firm response from Brussels to the plans on Wednesday evening had been interpreted ambiguously back in the UK, with EU officials saying they would study the plans before commenting in detail.\n\nBut reaction behind the scenes hardened on Wednesday. One senior EU official said the UK proposals \u201ccan\u2019t fly\u201d and that plans to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto over the plan were not acceptable.\n\nJean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, is expected to call Irish premier Leo Varadkar on Thursday afternoon to discuss the proposals. A spokesperson for Mr Juncker said he would \u201creiterate the EU\u2019s continued unity and solidarity behind Ireland\u201d.\n\nBoth Ireland and Brussels have dismissed reports in the UK media that Ireland is under pressure to accept the proposals. The country\u2019s European affairs minister Helen McEntee said: \u201cOur EU partners have stood beside us for the last three-and-a-half years, and that has not changed. We are not coming under pressure to change those key objectives.\u201d\n\nShe added that the proposals were \u201ca basis for discussions\u201d but that there \u201care obvious concerns\u201d.\n\nUnder the British plan, Northern Ireland would stay aligned with the EU single market regulations for goods, but stay in the UK customs zone. The result would be customs checks on products moving between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and regulatory checks on products moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The UK government says the checks could be done away from the border, though has provided little detail on how \u2013 with critics warning the sites would be customs centres in all but name.\n\nThe Northern Ireland assembly and executive would also have to vote to keep the plan going every four years, effectively constituting a veto.\n\nThe proposal has been received very poorly in Northern Ireland, where only the DUP has welcomed it out of the territory\u2019s main political parties. Business groups also condemned the plan, with a spokesperson for Manufacturing NI saying it would be \u201cworse\u201d than a no-deal Brexit and \u201cdecimate\u201d entire industries.\n\nIn the Commons, Boris Johnson indicated that he might be open to making further concessions to Brussels if it helped unblock talks. But he also faced a torrent of criticism that his plan lacked support in Northern Ireland and would break the law by imposing new customs checks.\n\nChallenged to name a single business that backed the blueprint, the prime minister was only able to say that companies badly wanted an agreement of some sort.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
