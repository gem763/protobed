Whoever their Pollster is, they suck. But @FoxNews is also much different than it used to be in the good old days. With people like Andrew Napolitano, who wanted to be a Supreme.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2019\n\n...Court Justice & I turned him down (he\u2019s been terrible ever since), Shep Smith, @donnabrazile (who gave Crooked Hillary the debate questions & got fired from @CNN), & others, @FoxNews doesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be. Oh well, I\u2019m President! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2019\n\nIn a series of tweets, Trump said the network\u2019s pollsters \u201csuck\u201d and falsely claimed he has \u201cNEVER had a good Fox News poll\u201d \u2014 despite regularly tweeting about favorable Fox News polls.\n\nHe went on to attack network figures like legal analyst Andrew Napolitano, who last week called Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukraine\u2019s president, in which he asked the country to investigate 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden, \u201ccriminal and impeachable.\u201d Trump also went after afternoon anchor Shep Smith, who frequently fact-checks Trump and points out the president\u2019s penchant for lying.\n\nThey stand in sharp contrast to the hosts of the network\u2019s flagship morning show \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d evening hosts Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham, and weekend host Jeanine Pirro, who are more friendly toward Trump.\n\nA representative for Fox News did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump\u2019s tweets Thursday.\n\nPolitical polling experts typically consider the network\u2019s polling team highly reputable.\n\nThe poll was covered on Thursday\u2019s episode of \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d which the president regularly watches.", "description": "The network released a poll showing 51% of registered voters favor impeachment proceedings against him.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9f37e4200000da064ff3d1.jpeg?cache=jqbqqdo9ow&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
