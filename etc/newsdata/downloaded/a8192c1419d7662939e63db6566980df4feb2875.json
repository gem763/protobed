So what?\u201d Hart\u2019s question is, I think, intended to display a lack of prejudice, but instead implies that coming out as gay is no longer newsworthy, because being gay is fine \u2014 especially with Hart.\n\nPutting aside that this is coming from the guy whose homophobic tweets lost him the job as host of the Academy Awards, let\u2019s be clear: It is huge news that Lil Nas X is gay. He has the longest-standing No. 1 hit in the entire history of the Billboard Hot 100, and chose to come out at that peak of his very young career. Like the rest of the world, rap and country music aren\u2019t known to welcome open queerness, and Lil Nas X\u2019s \u201cOld Town Road\u201d stands at the intersection of both. He had nothing to gain and everything to lose by coming out, and he did it anyway.\n\nSo. In his diplomatic response to Hart, Lil Nas X explained that his decision was also informed by having been raised to hate [homosexuality]. Hart\u2019s response: \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\nNas, who is 100 times funnier than Hart, replied, \u201cCome on, now.\u201d\n\nLike many people, I found Hart\u2019s comments dismissive, even delusional. If Hart was trying to perform his progressivism, he missed the mark. Pretending that everyone is already treated equally is not allyship, it\u2019s ignorance. That this is obviously and painfully untrue only makes the sentiment embarrassing for the speaker, and yet! Straight people \u2014 as any privileged group \u2014 love to say shit like this. \u201cOh, it doesn\u2019t matter! Love is love!\u201d Give me a break. Only some of that love is legislated by the Supreme Court and potential grounds for firing.\n\nOn a recent visit home, my mom told me how often her acquaintances react to the news of my (lesbian) wedding with self-congratulatory comments like, \u201cOh, isn\u2019t it great how easy it is to do that now?\u201d My mom finds this very annoying, and so do I. It\u2019s silencing, in a way \u2014 because the person is technically correct, and it is better than it used to be, I feel that the only acceptable (and certainly the desired) response is to agree. But that it\u2019s easier now to be queer than ever before doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy, particularly if you\u2019re not also white, cis, able-bodied, and middle class, as I am. What Lil Nas X did was exceptional, and courageous, and he\u2019s made it clear he thought carefully about what it would mean for him to come out when he did. There is no \u201cso what\u201d about it.", "description": "In a clip of an episode of \u201cThe Shop\u201d on HBO, Kevin Hart dismissed a question intended for Lil Nas X, who was asked to explain his decision to come out as gay while at the top of the charts.", "authors": ["Katie Heaney"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/05/05-lil-nas-x-kevin-hart.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
