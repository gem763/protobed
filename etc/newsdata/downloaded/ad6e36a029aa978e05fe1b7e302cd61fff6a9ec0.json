As Jones\u2019 right-hand man he led them to a Grand Slam, a Six Nations title and a world record-equalling run of 18 successive wins.\n\n(Image: Sunday Mirror)\n\n\u201cEddie is a competitor and that is what you want from a coach,\u201d said England\u2019s second most-capped player. \u201cHe talks openly about winning and the more you talk about winning the more you want to be a winner.\n\n\u201cFor too long we have tiptoed around the idea of being a winning English rugby team. There is nothing wrong with saying you want to win.\n\n\"We get caught up with being respectful and humble, but we are there to win, and Eddie communicates that to a T - and publicly.\n\n(Image: Jed Leicester)\n\n\u201cUnfortunately in this day and age a lot of the personality that you guys crave in the media is drummed out of the players. They are too cautious, they are too aware.\n\n\u201cSince day one Eddie has spoken about winning this World Cup and becoming the best team in the world. He brings colour and he brings personality along with being a bloody good coach.\u201d\n\n(Image: Jed Leicester)\n\nAs to how Jones will prepare his team for tomorrow\u2019s semi-final, Hartley said: \u201cFour years\u2019 worth of work has got England to this point.\n\n\"They will be preparing like they are going to win this game and push on.\n\n\u201cHow do I know this? Because Eddie is fairly consistent with his preparation, with his words and how he carries himself around the team. He is meticulous in everything he does.\u201d\n\nDylan Hartley was taking part in the Jeep Wrangler Trick Shot Challenge.
