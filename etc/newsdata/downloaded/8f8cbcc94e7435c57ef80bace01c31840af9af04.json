And he\u2019s gonna serve one month for each felony. How can you explain that to me?\u201d\n\nTurner faced a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison after being convicted of three felony counts of sexual assault for the January 2015 rape. The former athlete\u2019s sentence was later reduced due to good behavior and was subsequently released after serving 90 days.\n\nJUDGE IN BROCK TURNER CASE NOW WORKS AS HIGH SCHOOL TENNIS COACH\n\nMiller also recalled learning from news articles about the details of her rape, in which she was passed out outside a fraternity party.\n\n\u201cIt was surreal having the news broken to me by the internet,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI was alone, sitting at my desk, surrounded by coworkers, reading about how I was stripped and then penetrated and discarded in a bed of pine needles behind a dumpster.\u201d\n\nShe also pushed back against public scrutiny including those commenting online that she was to blame for her own assault because she had been drinking.\n\n\u201cRape is not a punishment for getting drunk,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd we have this really sick mindset in our culture as if you deserve rape if you drink to excess.\u201d\n\nBROCK TURNER SEX-ASSAULT VICTIM PLANS MEMOIR FOR SEPTEMBER RELEASE\n\n\u201cYou deserve a hangover, a really bad hangover, but you don\u2019t deserve to have somebody insert their body parts inside of you,\u201d she added.\n\nMiller also met Peter Jonsson and Carl Arndt, the two Swedish graduate students who intervened the assault and chased down Turner during Sunday night\u2019s program.\n\n\u201cThe same night the assault happened, a miracle also happened, which was that I was saved,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd thinking of the two Swedes who knew to do the right thing, and who wanted me really to be OK, always gave me hope.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThey changed the story,\u201d Miller added. \u201cThey changed the entire trajectory of my life.\u201d\n\nMiller is set to release a memoir on Tuesday titled \u201cKnow My Name\u201d about her sexual assault experience and its aftermath.", "description": "The woman who was sexually assaulted by former Stanford University swimmer Brock Turner was \u201cshocked\u201d when she learned he had been sentenced to only six months in jail, she said during a TV interview Sunday.", "authors": ["Gerren Keith Gaynor", "Gerren Keith Gaynor Is A Digital Editor At Fox News.
