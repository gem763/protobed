Now the company says it has grown to host more than 500,000 accounts on its service and has closed on $20 million in Series B funding to further its growth.\n\nThe round included new investors Wellington Management Company, Galaxy Digital EOS VC Fund and CMFG Ventures \u2014 the venture capital arm of the CUNA Mutual Group, a mutual insurance company serving credit unions and their 120 million members. Returning investors included QED Investors, Expa and Elizabeth Street Ventures.\n\nThe first version of Current, which debuted in 2017, was focused on giving parents a more modern way to dole out allowances and reward their kids for chores. But over time, the product became more like a real bank account for teens, culminating with the addition of routing and account numbers late last year. This allowed working teens to direct their paycheck to Current, as they could with a traditional bank.\n\nThis year, Current launched personal checking using the same core technology powering its teen banking product. The product includes features like faster direct deposits, gas hold crediting and merchant blocking without charging overdraft fees, hidden fees or requiring minimum balances.\n\nWhile the teen checking account users have an average age of 15, the average age for the new personal checking account users is 27.\n\nAlthough personal checking was only launched in late January, it already accounts for about half of Current\u2019s accounts. It also benefits from conversions from Current\u2019s teen users who turn 18 and want to graduate to their own banking app. (Around 98% of teens on Current move to the personal checking app when they come of age, the company noted.)\n\nThis puts Current in a more competitive market, where a number of banking apps are now targeting a younger, more mobile generation that has begun to favor modern, feature-rich apps over brick-and-mortar banks. Among its rivals are apps like Step, Cleo, N26, Chime, Simple, Stash and others.\n\nLike many in this space, Current isn\u2019t actually a bank \u2014 its banking services are provided by Choice Financial Group and Metropolitan Commercial Bank, which allows it to offer FDIC insurance up to $250,000. Instead, many of the banking apps focus instead on the feature set and user experience they can offer.\n\nBoth of Current\u2019s products include a Visa co-branded debit card tied to the Current account. Along with the funding, Current and Visa are also announcing an expanded joint marketing partnership, which will help Current reach new customers.\n\n\u201cWe believe everyone should have access to affordable financial services that improve the chances for a better life,\u201d said Stuart Sopp, Current founder and CEO. \u201cWe have made this a reality through rebuilding financial infrastructure with the Current Core. It allows us to build more products that offer new ways to interact with money. Our rapid growth to half a million accounts serves as a testament to the ways our products and cost savings are bringing better financial outcomes and we anticipate bringing those benefits to over 1,000,000 customers by mid-2020.\u201d\n\nThe company is planning to launch more features starting next year, including a cash-back system with brands and merchants in Q1, and further down the road, it\u2019s considering things like a credit product and maybe Bitcoin investing. But this will require further education and careful attention to do well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s expensive to be poor \u2014 it really is,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have much money, you\u2019re paying 30% or 35% for your credit, whereas if you\u2019re rich you\u2019re paying 5%. So it\u2019s like the world is inverted for you and it holds you down,\u201d Sopp says. \u201cSo if we were to do [credit], we are going to do it right.\u201d\n\nIn the near-term, the focus is on offering better budgeting tools and more ways for users to save money. This, Sopp argues, is what Current\u2019s young users need most.\n\nTo date, Current has raised $45 million in funding.", "description": "Mobile banking app Current, which began as a teen debit card controlled by parents, expanded to offer personal checking accounts earlier this year.
