Chief", "language": "en", "text": "(STRASBOURG, France) \u2014 The risk of Britain leaving the European Union without a divorce deal remains \u201cvery real,\u201d European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker declared Wednesday as EU lawmakers debated the ramifications of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nSpeaking at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, Juncker, who met with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday, said a no-deal Brexit \u201cmight be the choice of the U.K., but it will never be ours.\u201d\n\nAfter the debate, the European Parliament is set to adopt a resolution laying out its concerns about Britain\u2019s impending departure from the 28-nation bloc on Oct. 31. Johnson has been adamant the U.K. will leave the EU on that date with or without a withdrawal agreement.\n\nThe main sticking point over a Brexit deal is the Irish border backstop, which would require Britain to respect EU trade and customs rules in order to avoid a hard border between EU member Ireland and the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland until a better solution is found.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\n\u201cI have no sentimental attachment to the backstop,\u201d Juncker said, adding, however, that he remains attached to the purpose it serves, which is not to create border structures that could be detrimental to peace in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u201cThat is why I called on British prime minister to come forward with concrete proposals, operational and in writing on all alternatives that would allow us to reach these objectives,\u201d Juncker said.\n\nEU leaders have made clear that any amendment to the current proposed divorce deal should preserve the bloc\u2019s single market and uphold the Good Friday peace agreement that ended decades of conflict in Northern Ireland.\n\nDespite his declaration that Britain will leave on Oct. 31 \u201cdo or die,\u201d Johnson insists he can strike a revised divorce deal with the bloc in time for an orderly departure. European leaders are skeptical of that declaration.\n\n\u201cI asked the British prime minister to specify the alternative arrangements that he could envisage,\u201d Juncker said. \u201cAs long as such proposals are not made, I cannot tell you \u2014 while looking you straight in the eye \u2014 that progress is being made.\u201d\n\nThe Brexit agreement made with the EU by Johnson\u2019s predecessor, Theresa May, was rejected three times by Britain\u2019s Parliament, prompting May to resign and the fiercely pro-Brexit Johnson to come to power in July.\n\nSpelling out the need for the backstop, EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier warned that even if Britain leaves without any agreement at all, several major problems will still have to be resolved, including the future of citizens hit by Brexit, peace in Northern Ireland and the protection of the EU\u2019s single market and the Irish economy.\n\n\u201cNone of these questions disappears,\u201d Barnier said Wednesday, insisting that the challenges must not be underestimated. \u201cWe need legally operative solutions in the withdrawal agreement to respond precisely to each problem \u2014 to address each risk \u2014 that Brexit creates.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome three years after the British referendum, it\u2019s not a question of pretending to negotiate. It\u2019s our responsibility to continue this process with determination and sincerity,\u201d Barnier told the European lawmakers.\n\nIn London, Britain\u2019s Supreme Court was set to resume its hearing to determine whether Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend Parliament was illegal. Judges must determine if Johnson overstepped his authority by suspending Parliament for a five-week period during the run-up to the Brexit deadline.\n\nThe government\u2019s opponents argue that Johnson illegally shut down Parliament just weeks before the scheduled Brexit date for the \u201cimproper purpose\u201d of dodging lawmakers\u2019 legitimate scrutiny of his Brexit plans. They also say Johnson misled Queen Elizabeth II, whose approval was needed for the shutdown.\n\nSpeaking in Strasbourg, the European Parliament\u2019s top Brexit official attacked Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue Parliament. Noting that Eurosceptic politicians often criticize the EU for being undemocratic, Guy Verhofstadt said EU leaders \u201ccan do a lot of things, but at least they cannot close the doors of our house. That is not possible.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The risk of Britain leaving the E.U. without a divorce deal remains \"very real,\" European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker says", "authors": ["Samuel Petrequin", "Mark Carlson"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/european_commission_jean-claude_juncker_brexit.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C123px%2C4844px%2C2536px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
