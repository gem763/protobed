Bolton, the former national security adviser, delivered a stark warning on Monday about President Trump\u2019s approach to North Korea, undercutting the president\u2019s insistence that its leader, Kim Jong-un, wanted to make a denuclearization deal with him.\n\nWithout mentioning Mr. Trump by name, Mr. Bolton said he wanted to \u201cspeak in unvarnished terms about the threat posed by North Korea,\u201d and made it clear that he thought the president\u2019s outreach to Mr. Kim had benefited only one side. And while Mr. Trump has made a deal with Mr. Kim one of his signature foreign policy goals, Mr. Bolton asserted that there had been no gains with his approach.\n\n\u201cThe strategic decision Kim Jong-un is operating through is that he will do whatever he can to keep a deliverable nuclear weapons capability and to develop and enhance it further,\u201d Mr. Bolton said during an appearance at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cUnder current circumstances, he will never give up the nuclear weapons voluntarily.\u201d\n\nMr. Bolton was pushed out from his job as Mr. Trump\u2019s third national security adviser less than a month ago amid disputes over how to handle major foreign policy challenges, including North Korea.", "description": "John R.
