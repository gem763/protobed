Show Hide The EU Withdrawal (No 2) Act, often referred to as the Benn act, is a law that was passed by MPs in an attempt to prevent Boris Johnson's government leaving the EU without a deal. It specifies that by 19 October the government must have either secured a deal that parliament has approved, or secured explicit approval from parliament to leave without a deal. If neither of those conditions are met \u2013 and if Johnson cannot get his deal passed on 'super Saturday' \u2013 it requires the prime minister to write to the EU to ask for a further Brexit extension. The form of the letter that the prime minister must send is set out in full in the act. The act says the extension should last until 31 January 2020, or longer if the EU suggests. Here is the full text of the European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act 2019 Martin Belam\n\nThe court needs to decide whether those pledges included not trying to frustrate that act, known in full as the European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act, by simultaneously asking for the extension request to be ignored.\n\nCarloway postponed a ruling at the first hearing of this case on 9 October, in part because the government\u2019s lawyers made \u201cdetailed and specific\u201d statements to uphold the law on Johnson\u2019s behalf.\n\nIf the three judges find Johnson is in contempt, he could theoretically face a fine or even jail, but the court could suspend a ruling on sanctions to give the prime minister time to comply with its ruling.\n\nAfter losing a knife-edge Commons vote on Saturday on a delay to his deal, Johnson sent an unsigned copy of the letter required by the act but also sent another personal letter to Brussels that explicitly asked EU leaders not to agree yet to an extension.\n\nJohnson is also reported to have spoken privately to key EU figures on Saturday to make the same point, as he tries to buy extra time to force his deal through Westminster before the planned Brexit day on 31 October.\n\nLawyers for three anti-Brexit campaigners are expected to argue on Monday those steps are a clear breach of the government\u2019s promises to the court, made by lawyers acting on behalf of Lord Keen, the advocate general and the UK government\u2019s law officer for Scotland.\n\nThe government objected to an application from those campaigners, Dale Vince, a green energy entrepreneur, Jolyon Maugham QC, and Joanna Cherry QC, an SNP MP, for an interdict or injunction that would force the prime minister to stick to the Benn act\u2019s provisions.\n\nActing on Lord Keen\u2019s behalf, the government\u2019s lawyers told the court there was no need to issue an interdict because Johnson accepted \u201cthat he is subject to the public law principle that he cannot frustrate its purpose or the purpose of its provisions\u201d.\n\nThe submission repeatedly added that \u201cthe prime minister is subject to the law and, as would be expected of a minister of the crown, there is no question but that he will comply with the requirements of the law. He has repeatedly said so.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 1:23 Keir Starmer suggests Labour could back Brexit deal if second referendum attached \u2013 video\n\nAidan O\u2019Neill QC, the anti-Brexit campaigners\u2019 advocate, is expected to ask the judges to replay sections of a BBC recording of the first hearing on 9 October when government lawyers confirmed Johnson would not try to sabotage the Benn act\u2019s provisions.\n\nThe government is expected to argue on Monday that Johnson honoured his promises to the court by sending the letter as required, and that it was lawful for him to simultaneously argue against an extension.\n\nHowever, David Johnston QC, one of the government\u2019s two QCs, told the court earlier this month that Johnson knew he faced legal sanctions if he broke the law. \u201cI would have to accept that the court will be able to deal with that one way or another,\u201d he said.\n\nMaugham and his co-campaigners had originally asked the court to consider using its unique powers, known as nobile officium, to write that letter on Johnson\u2019s behalf if he failed to do so. That part of the case is now likely to be dropped.\n\nMaugham said it was up to Carloway and his fellow judges to consider now whether they felt the court had been misled about Johnson\u2019s plans to frustrate the act and if so, what sanction should be imposed.\n\n\u201cThe court\u2019s role is to uphold the law \u2013 not to act as parent to a stroppy child,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question of whether the prime minister is in contempt of court \u2013 as many commentators have argued \u2013 is really one for it. But we will supply the court with the relevant footage from the inner house hearing [of 9 October].\u201d", "description": "Prime minister broke promise not to frustrate Benn act, Scotland\u2019s most senior judge will hearBrexit latest: the day\u2019s developments", "authors": ["Severin Carrell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/607fb4edde5d3001b0f68cf9242ffdf4afef63eb/371_652_2748_1649/master/2748.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=65bdc02c2f4cd77cd554ed29aaa505d4", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
