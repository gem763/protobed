And then we move on. But then that person\u2019s life has still been, in some cases, irrevocably altered even as the rest of us have moved on,\u201d Mr. Yang added. \u201cSo to me, it\u2019s vital that we humanize each other. We humanize the consequences of some of these impulses not just in terms if who hears the expression but who is losing a livelihood as a result.\u201d\n\nMr. Gillis was named last Thursday, Sept. 12, as one of three comedians joining the cast of \u201cSNL\u201d for the show\u2019s 45th season starting next month. He was cut days later, however, after recordings surfaced of him using racist and bigoted language, including an ethic slur for Asian people while joking about Mr. Yang, the son of Taiwanese immigrants.\n\n\u201cHe was a still forming comedian that had made some terrible and offensive jokes, and to me, that did not rise to a level where he should lose his job,\u201d said Mr. Yang, The Hill reported.\n\nMr. Gillis said last week that he is \u201chappy to apologize to anyone who\u2019s actually offended by anything I\u2019ve said.\u201d He said in a subsequent statement that he understands the show\u2019s decision and is grateful for briefly bringing him on board.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
