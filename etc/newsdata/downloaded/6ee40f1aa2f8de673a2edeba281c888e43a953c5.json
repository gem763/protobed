Gavin Newsom on Friday announced that he has commuted the sentences of 21 prison inmates.\n\nMost were convicted of murder or attempted murder; seven had been serving life terms with no chance of parole.\n\nThe freshman Democratic governor criticized what he called the \u201cdisproportionately long sentencing enhancements\u201d for some felons, including 25-years-to-life enhancements for using a firearm.\n\nThe commutations do not free the inmates, but make them eligible for parole hearings.\n\nHe noted in several of the commutations that the offender had been an accomplice in a slaying but did not pull the trigger. California recently enacted laws limiting the so-called felony murder rule, as well as laws making sure youthful offenders are considered for parole.\n\nHis office could not say if those laws would have affected any of those whose sentences he commuted.\n\nNewsom\u2019s predecessor, Jerry Brown, had criticized the numerous sentencing enhancements allowed under California law, many adopted as get-tough policies in the 1980s and 1990s. State lawmakers on Friday were on the verge of sending him a bill ending a mandatory one-year enhancement for repeat nonviolent felonies, though Newsom has not said if he will sign it.\n\nThe governor commuted the sentence of an 80-year-old woman, Doris Roldan, who was serving a life-without-parole sentence from Los Angeles County for working with two accomplices to kill her husband when she was 42 years old.\n\nBut he cited the youth of 16 offenders, several of whom were teenagers and one of whom was convicted as a minor.\n\nNewsom\u2019s office pointed to studies that the part of the brain responsible for impulse control does not mature until well into adulthood, along with offenders\u2019 capacity for remorse and rehabilitation. He noted that the state and federal courts and California lawmakers have all found that youthful offenders must have a meaningful opportunity for parole.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTwo other inmates benefited from a program that trains and socializes dogs rescued from animal shelters, some of who are prepared to help veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nThe Paws For Life program says former Governor Brown also recognized the program, which it says has had the most commutations of life sentences of any program in the state.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nClick for more from Fox 11 Los Angeles.", "description": "Citing the youth of several of the offenders when they committed their crimes, California Gov.
