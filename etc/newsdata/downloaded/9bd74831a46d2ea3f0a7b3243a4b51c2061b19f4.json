Fighting continued in a northeast Syrian border town at the center of the fight between Turkey and Kurdish forces early Friday, despite a U.S.-brokered cease-fire that went into effect overnight. Shelling and gunfire could be heard in and around Ras al-Ayn, as smoke billowed from locations near the border with Turkey and the Turkish town of Ceylanpinar. (AP Photo/Lefteris Pitarakis)\n\nANKARA, Turkey (AP) \u2014 The latest on Turkey's invasion of northern Syria (all times local):\n\n11:50 a.m.\n\nA member of the Syrian Kurdish force says its fighters will not pull back from border towns, asserting that an agreement with Turkey to vacate those areas \"will not work.\"\n\nThe fighter spoke Friday while Ras al-Ayn, a town on the border, was shelled from Turkey despite the cease-fire agreement brokered overnight between the U.S. and Turkey. The Syrian Kurdish forces say they will abide by the cease-fire.\n\nBut the Kurdish fighter says the agreement \u2014 which asks them to withdraw \u2014 is an \"insult\" to the force. He says the Kurds will not give up their land. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters.\n\nThe agreement would solidify the position Turkey has gained in the offensive that began Oct. 9, and asks the Kurdish-led force to vacate a swath of land along the border.\n\nWhile the Kurds call it a cease-fire, Turkey says it is a pause. The two sides disagree on the size of the cease-fire area.\n\n\u2014 Sarah El Deeb\n\n___\n\n11:40 a.m.\n\nTurkey's Defense Ministry says a soldier has been killed by shots fired across the border from Iran during a border patrol.\n\nA ministry statement on Friday said the soldier was killed in the border town of Caldiran, in eastern Van province. Two other soldiers were lightly wounded, it said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the attack was related to Turkey's invasion of northeast Syria against Kurdish forces. Tens of thousands of people have been driven from their homes ahead of the Turkish advance.\n\nTurkey views the Kurdish fighters as terrorists because of their links to a decades-long insurgency in the country's southeast.\n\nIran \u2014 like Turkey, Iraq and Syria \u2014 is home to an ethnic Kurdish population. An Iranian Kurdish militant group, also accused of links to Kurdish insurgents in Turkey, operates there.\n\n___\n\n11:30 a.m.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has met with Israel's prime minister to reaffirm the countries' close ties at a time when many in Israel fear the Trump administration intends to give up on the Middle East.\n\nIn brief remarks after their meeting, Pompeo praised the \"remarkable, close relationship\" with Israel and said they discussed efforts to counter Iran and other challenges in the region. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked Pompeo for America's \"consistent support.\"\n\nNetanyahu is a close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump and welcomed his decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.\n\nBut Trump's decision to abandon America's Syrian Kurdish allies in the face of Turkey's offensive in northern Syria, along with other recent moves, has raised concerns that Trump might not be a reliable ally.\n\nWhen asked about a U.S.-brokered cease-fire on Thursday aimed at halting the fighting in Syria, Netanyahu said \"we hope things will turn out for the best.\"\n\n___\n\n11:20 a.m.\n\nTurkey's pro-government dominated media is hailing the U.S.-Turkish cease-fire deal in northeast Syria as a victory for Turkey's president.\n\nAfter hours of negotiations between Recep Tayyip Erdogan and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, the two nations agreed to a five-day cease-fire in Turkey's weeklong offensive against Kurdish fighters in northern Syria.\n\nThe agreement requires the Kurdish fighters to vacate a swath of territory inside Syria along the Turkish border. That arrangement would largely solidify the position Turkey has gained after ten days of fighting. The Kurds were U.S. allies in the fight against the Islamic State.\n\nYeni Safak newspaper's banner headline on Friday hailed a \"Great Victory.\" It wrote: \"Turkey got everything it wanted.\"\n\nSabah newspaper's headline read: \"We won both on the field and on the (negotiating) table.\"\n\nKurdish-led forces have invited the Syrian government's military, backed by Russia, to deploy there to protect them from Turkey.\n\n___\n\n9:20 a.m.\n\nAssociated Press journalists are seeing continued fighting in a Syrian town at the center of the fight between Turkey and Kurdish forces, despite a U.S.-brokered cease-fire.\n\nShelling and smoke could be seen around Ras al-Ayn on Friday morning, a day after Turkey and the U.S. agreed to a five-day cease-fire in Turkey's offensive.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, reports intermittent clashes in Ras al-Ayn, but relative calm elsewhere since the cease-fire.\n\nThe agreement requires the Kurdish fighters to vacate a swath of territory in Syria along the Turkish border, largely solidifying Turkey's position.\n\nTurkish troops and Turkish-backed Syrian fighters launched their offensive a week ago, two days after U.S. President Donald Trump suddenly announced he was withdrawing American troops from the border area.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/o.2CrZOxy3M1TL6SI5D4Aw--~B/aD0yNTI1O3c9MzUxODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/1e1a78343e13e15ef5123f0fc3f2f0c9", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
