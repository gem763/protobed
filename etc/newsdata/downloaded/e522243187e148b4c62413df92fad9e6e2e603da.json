Expeditions at the quarries from 2014 to 2016 recovered ancient charcoal and stone tools. In some places, the charcoal was mixed with dirt and stones to form flat platforms, which may have been used like loading bays to distribute the massive pillars, said Michael Parker Pearson, an archaeologist at University College London and an author of the new study.\n\nAmong the Welsh hills, bluestones erupted from the ground. Here, millions of years ago, sheets of magma slowly cooled into columns. Eons passed, and softer rock around the magma eroded. Only the jagged bluestones remained.\n\nPrehistoric workers probably exploited natural weaknesses in these structures, Parker Pearson said. \u201cThey\u2019re nearly vertical,\u201d he said. \u201cAll you\u2019ve got to do is get a lasso around each one and pull.\u201d\n\nWith ropes and simple tools, such as sandstone wedges shoved into the outcrop\u2019s joints, excavators may have plucked out a pillar as cleanly as a loose tooth. Those on top of the outcrop could have carefully slackened their ropes to control the pillar\u2019s descent to a platform below, the authors wrote. From there, workers may have lowered a stone, six feet long and weighing two to four tons, onto a wooden sled to haul it away.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBluestones are big, but not so big that a \u201cburly group of Stone Age men\u201d couldn\u2019t drag them across the countryside, said Nicholas Pearce, a geochemist at Aberystwyth University in Wales, who was not involved with the current study.\n\nThese pillars are \u201cthe Ikea version of Neolithic megaliths,\u201d Parker Pearson joked \u2014 the stones peeled off the outcrop as though from ready-to-use kits. Unlike the people who crafted Egypt\u2019s obelisks from much larger rocks, Stonehenge\u2019s builders did not need to rework the bluestone pillars.\n\nThe bluestones, which are speckled with fingernail-size deposits of white minerals, form an inner horseshoe and ring at Stonehenge. These rocks, though impressive, are not Stonehenge\u2019s biggest. The imposing sandstone trilithons, the three-part structures made of two vertical stones and a horizontal top, are larger and more locally sourced, though their exact origins are unknown.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPrevious chemical studies linked the bluestones to the Preseli Hills in Pembrokeshire, Wales. \u201cThat\u2019s the only place you get that particular rock type,\u201d Pearce said.\n\nHumans buried at Stonehenge probably came from this region of Wales, too. Remains at the site contain isotopes consistent with life near the quarries. Just a few miles separate the two outcrops \u2014 standing on one quarry, it\u2019s possible to see the other, Pearce said.\n\nRadiocarbon dating indicates that the quarry charcoal is about 5,000 years old. The Welsh charcoal and Stonehenge remains suggest a connection in time as well as space. \u201cWe\u2019ve got dates for both quarries that link nicely with the first dates at Stonehenge,\u201d Parker Pearson said. The bluestones and early Welsh travelers could have arrived at the Salisbury Plain together. There\u2019s about 100 years of fuzziness in the radiocarbon dating, though. \u201cIt could be immediate, it could be 100 years from getting from A to B,\u201d Parker Pearson said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUnexpectedly, the quarries are on the northern side of the hills. The south side is closer to the ocean, where, according to one hypothesis, prehistoric travelers floated bluestones along the coast. An attempt to replicate a bluestone float failed spectacularly in 2000, however, when a raft carrying a stone sank close to shore. Parker Pearson and his colleagues suspect that the stones were transported over land instead, on sledges.\n\nThe existence of the quarries \u201cconclusively invalidates\u201d the misconception that Ice Age glaciers pushed the bluestones into the region, the authors of the new study said.\n\nBournemouth University archaeologist Timothy Darvill, who was not involved with this study, said that geological evidence points to \u201cseveral other sources\u201d of stone, including a site called Carn Menyn. Routes between Wales and Stonehenge remain speculative, Darvill said, though he agreed stones probably moved over land rather than by sea.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAmong Europe\u2019s megalithic structures, Stonehenge is an oddity. Most other prehistoric builders did not stray more than 10 miles to collect stones for their monuments. Why craft Stonehenge from such far-flung pieces? Parker Pearson offered one idea. He suggested that Stonehenge was a unifying symbol for British tribes, constructed during what may have been a period of economic and population decline.\n\n\u201cA major event like this,\u201d he said, \u201cwould have brought together disparate communities that were growing apart.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Archaeological evidence suggests a strong connection between Stonehenge and distant parts of Great Britain.", "authors": ["Ben Guarino", "Reporter Covering The Practice", "Culture Of Science"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rFsHr-r4wBJKeZR-5cTXYhhqkT8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/N4M7GDNROBDYZHTE7S6DT3JBOU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-20"}
