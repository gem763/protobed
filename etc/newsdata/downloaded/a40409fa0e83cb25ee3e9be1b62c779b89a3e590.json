Following McCain\u2019s remarks on the China comments, Behar pointed out that they would be discussing this next segment and to hold her thoughts until then, prompting McCain to complain that she wasn\u2019t aware it was coming up.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know we were doing it next,\u201d she huffed. \u201cSorry! I\u2019m sorry! It was in conjunction of what we were saying.\u201d\n\nBehar, meanwhile, noted that it was \u201calright\u201d before pivoting to the economy, pointing out that the president\u2019s base isn\u2019t turning on him yet and the media needs to focus on economic concerns.\n\n\u201cThe media needs to stop doing Trump 24/7 and start talking about the fact that the economy is really slowing down,\u201d she stated. \u201cJobs are slowing down. The farmers are in trouble. Manufacturing is taking a dive.\u201d\n\nMcCain, however, vehemently disagreed with Behar, claiming the \u201ceconomy is not falling down\u201d before insisting that her liberal counterpart\u2019s warning about the economy is \u201cpart of the problem\u201d for conservatives.\n\n\u201cYeah, it is, the Dow dropped 800 points in two days,\u201d Behar shot back. \u201cAgriculture is taking a hit. The farmers are in trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fake news,\u201d McCain sneered, using one of the president\u2019s favorite attack lines. \u201cThat\u2019s just fake news that the economy is slowing down. That\u2019s just fake news. It\u2019s part of the paradigm of why his base is still standing with him.\u201d\n\nMcCain further asserted that if the economy was struggling Trump wouldn\u2019t tweet about the jobs numbers on Friday morning.\n\nThe jobs numbers, meanwhile, were short of expectations and the manufacturing index is at its lowest point in more than a decade amid Trump\u2019s trade wars. Furthermore, the service job sector hit its slowest growth in three years. This all comes on the heels of this summer\u2019s recession panic over the yield-curve inversion, causing stocks to drop sharply and the Federal Reserve to cut rates twice in recent months.", "description": "The conservative co-host suggested negative comments about the economy are \u201cwhy [Trump\u2019s] base is still standing with him.\u201d", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_701,w_1247,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570206866/mccainbehar_qt8gmj", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
