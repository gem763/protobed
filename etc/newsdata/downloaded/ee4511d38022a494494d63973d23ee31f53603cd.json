They're also more fun to play with an audience.\n\nGame-streaming has taken off in recent years, thanks to the lowered barriers to entry: Webcams and microphones aren't too expensive, and there are so many computers out there with more than enough power to handle playing a game and streaming it online simultaneously.\n\nThousands of people have turned their game-playing habits into full-fledged careers. Many don't reach the heights of, say, Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins, who rose to fame after rappers Drake and Travis Scott played \"Fortnite\" with him on Twitch one fateful night (he's also one of the best players of \"Fortnite,\" one of the most popular games in the world, which totally helps).\n\nBut even if you don't become a celebrity through streaming, people can still make a decent living from playing video games in front of a live audience. And game-streaming can be a great outlet, too: a way to work out your problems, connect with others, and make new friends.\n\nGame streamers have done lots of good for greater communities as well: For example, players from the \"Destiny\" community raised over $4 million for St. Jude Children's Research during a few short weeks this summer. Many streamers also participate in the series of Games Done Quick charity marathons each year, which have raised over $22 million for charities like Doctors Without Borders and the Prevent Cancer Foundation.\n\nIf you're considering game-streaming for a living, there's a lot to look forward to. We have a separate story detailing the downsides of being a professional gamer, but we wanted to highlight all of the ways in which this profession can have a positive impact on your life, and the lives of others.", "description": "Game-streaming can be a great outlet: a way to make extra money on the side, work out your problems, connect with others, and make new friends.", "authors": ["Dave Smith"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8537692e22af74d03079a4?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
