Some men buy flowers. Some men buy gifts. This man brought a bouquet of fresh cut petty,\" another wrote.\n\nHowever, someone else stated that in their opinion, wearing the T-shirt to the match was an \"appalling\" thing for Ohanian to do.\n\n\"He's not how real men support their wives,\" they continued.\n\nWilliams' victory against Sharapova at the 2019 US Open marked her 19th consecutive win against the 32-year-old.\n\nThe 23-time Grand Slam winner beat Sharapova 6-1 6-1 in a match which lasted just under an hour.\n\nWilliams will face fellow American tennis player Catherine McNally in the second round of the tournament on Wednesday.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
