Credit Suisse has since passed the stake on SPF Investment Management, which was spun out of the Swisse bank.\n\nTogether the \"minority investors\" would own 9 per cent of the listed Latitude worth about $350 million, according to an offer structure in front of potential investors.\n\nIt's another big move by First State, which is proving to be an active dealmakers in Australian capital markets. The industry fund rocketed on to dealmakers' radars when it paid $1 billion for NSW's financial planning business State Plus in 2016 and has been an active equity syndicate member in recent asset auctions.", "description": "The industry fund dubbed \"the mini AustralianSuper\" is set to be one of Latitude's biggest institutional shareholders.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.572%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/73a8fe9c34491f6c085c6ade0cfb4152f5d9403c", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
