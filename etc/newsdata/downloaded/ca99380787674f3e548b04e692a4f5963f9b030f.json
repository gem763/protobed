The successful test of the framework has been first announced by Italian media at the end of September though with little details.\n\nPlatform viability has been demonstrated\n\nNow ABI reveals that the test has seen 200 million data entries being processed by the blockchain banking reconciliation system, effectively simulating one year of Italian banking activity.\n\nThe successful test allegedly demonstrates the sustainability of the verification procedure and the platform itself.\n\nThe data has been introduced to the platform through 35 nodes distributed throughout Italy. Eighteen Italian banks \u2014 comprising 78% of the country\u2019s banking workforce \u2014 are part of the project.\n\nImplementation to come in 2020\n\nThe recently amended banking agreements will reportedly allow for the system to be implemented by March 1, 2020. As Cointelegraph reported, ABI first announced the intention to deploy blockchain technology in mid-June.\n\nThe Spunta Project is coordinated by the association\u2019s research organization, ABI Lab, and sees participation from system integration firm NTT Data, decentralized data storage platform Sia and enterprise blockchain firm R3 with its Corda network.", "description": "The reconciliation data of an entire year of Italian banking activity on a blockchain platform, announced the local banking association", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvOWI5MGUzNjMzMjAyYzRjNDYyMDVkMWZiOTIzOTkyNWEuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
