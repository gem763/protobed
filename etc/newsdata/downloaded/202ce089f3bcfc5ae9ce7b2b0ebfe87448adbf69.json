REUTERS/Matthew Tostevin\n\nVeerathai Santiprabhob told Reuters in an interview that he thinks monetary policy is currently accommodative, but the bank is ready to take action if needed - and is keeping a close watch out for any further global shocks.\n\nThe Bank of Thailand (BOT)'s monetary policy committee held policy steady last week after a surprise rate cut in August, but downgraded its 2019 growth outlook amid heightened global risks and a strong baht THB=TH.\n\n\u201cFor the current projections, I think that the current policy rate is accommodative,\u201d Veerathai said.\n\n\u201cBut if we see the deterioration of economic activity beyond what we have forecast, we stand ready to review our monetary policy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf the global economic condition deteriorates much further, that would be one of the main factors. I think that\u2019s the largest factor\u201d.\n\nRisks to financial stability are still a concern for the policy committee, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen interest rates have been low for a long time, it has some impact on the leverage of the whole economy... We need to be mindful of that impact on financial stability as well\u201d.\n\nHigh household debt levels - at 78.7% of GDP at the end of June - are \u201cnot healthy\u201d, Veerathai said, adding he is hoping that will come down or at least the trend will stop.\n\nRecent government stimulus measures are helpful, and more are expected, Veerathai said. He declined to give details as to exactly what he expected, but said it was not only about spending money.\n\nOn Sept. 25, the BOT kept its benchmark interest rate THCBIR=ECI unchanged at 1.50% - just a quarter point above the record low.\n\nBut it cut its 2019 economic growth forecast 2.8% - which would be the lowest since 2014 - from 3.3%, and predicted falling exports. Last year\u2019s growth was 4.1%.\n\nIn April-June, Southeast Asia\u2019s second-largest economy expanded just 2.3%, the weakest pace in nearly five years.\n\nThe rate cut did little to curb the baht\u2019s strength and with low inflation and weak growth, some analysts expect further rate cuts later this year.\n\n(GRAPHIC - Thai Policy interest rate, GDP and CPI: here)\n\nFURTHER RELAX RULES ON OUTFLOWS\n\nThe central bank will monitor the movement of the baht closely and is ready to deploy measures on \u201cundesirable inflows\u201d to make sure that the baht\u2019s movement does not hurt the economy, Veerathai said.\n\nBefore the end of the year, the central bank will announce more liberalization on capital outflows for Thai investors to invest abroad to help better balance inflows and outflows, Veerathai said.\n\nThat will be a \u201csubstantial increase\u201d in the ceilings that let investors such as mutual funds invest abroad, while the limit that allows Thai investors to directly invest overseas will also be increased, he said.\n\nThere will be measures that allow exporters to have more flexibility in keeping foreign currencies abroad, instead of bringing them back to Thailand, Veerathai said.\n\nThe baht is Asia\u2019s best performing currency this year, up nearly 7% against the dollar, putting further pressure on Thailand\u2019s export-driven economy.\n\nVeerathai said he did not expect headline inflation to be negative and it should return to the central bank\u2019s 1-4% target range next year.\n\nThe central bank will decide at the year-end whether it needs to impose a debt service ratio limit, he said.", "description": "In the face of a strong baht that has been Asia's best performing currency this year, Thailand will further relax rules on capital outflows before the end of the year, the central bank governor said on Friday.", "authors": ["Matthew Tostevin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437005608&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930VJ", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
