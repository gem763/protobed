Experts are sceptical", "language": "en", "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A team of experts has come up with a plan to use blockchain tracking for trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to avoid the re-imposition of a hard border after Britain leaves the European Union.\n\nFILE PHOTO: View of the border crossing between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland outside Newry, Northern Ireland, Britain, October 1, 2019. REUTERS/Lorraine O'Sullivan/File Photo\n\nThe ELAND consortium said on Monday that its proposal would involve building a secure freight transit system based on digital-locking containers, GPS routing records, automated certification and anti-tampering enforcement with every detail recorded in a blockchain time-series database.\n\n\u201cIn essence, it is a bonded warehouse on wheels, and cuts the Gordian knot of how the UK can both leave the EU and maintain the guarantees set out in the Good Friday Agreement,\u201d ELAND CEO Charles Le Gallais said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe are enabling the seamless movement of goods across borders to continue without the need for an Irish backstop,\u201d said Le Gallais, a former British soldier whose team includes business leaders, haulage experts and technology engineers.\n\nLe Gallais told Reuters that British Brexit officials and the Irish parliament had been briefed on the plan.\n\nA British government spokesman, asked about the plan, said: \u201cThe government is grateful for all input in this matter, which it considers carefully.\u201d\n\nIn Dublin, a spokesman for the Irish government said: \u201cWe have no comment to make on this proposal.\u201d\n\nRazat Gaurav, chief executive office of Llamasoft, which produces software to help companies around the world manage and structure supply chains, said the plan would provide visibility of what is crossing the border, and security. However, if it is too complex, industry wouldn\u2019t use it.\n\nManufacturing Northern Ireland, a group that campaigns to reduce the cost of doing business, dismissed it as only viable for valuable or sensitive goods such as alcohol or medicines.\n\nThe Irish border is the main stumbling block for Britain\u2019s divorce from the EU, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson says must happen on Oct. 31 even without a deal.\n\nLast week Johnson proposed that, after Brexit, Northern Ireland would remain aligned with the EU\u2019s single market for trade in animal, food and manufactured goods but would leave the EU\u2019s customs union along with the rest of the UK.\n\nThis would inevitably require some form of border checks to preserve the integrity of the single market. The Johnson proposal says there would still be no need for physical infrastructure on the border thanks to alternative arrangements for checks, including monitoring technology.\n\nEU officials have been sceptical of British suggestions that technology could do the job because London has not demonstrated that such solutions even existed.\n\nELAND said its proposal was based on \u201cproven technology\u201d, would be demonstrable within three months and could be fully implemented within one year.\n\nManufacturing Northern Ireland Chief Executive Stephen Kelly said the plan might work for rigid lorries that can be digitally locked at loading point, but it\u2019s not clear how it would work for other vehicles such as curtain-side trailers and tankers.\n\nIt would also require customs officials to trust operators not to smuggle and to be truthful about the content of their trucks, and he doubted that the owners of Northern Ireland\u2019s 140,000 lorries would invest in the equipment needed.\n\n\u201cIf this was a viable idea, Sweden-Norway, USA-Canada borders would be already using it and both are world leaders in transport tech,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nLlamasoft\u2019s Gaurav said that, based on his experience elsewhere in the world, if industry finds the tracking system too cumbersome it won\u2019t adopt the technology.\n\n\u201cThey try to find ways to work around it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then you\u2019re back to a physical check.\u201d", "description": "A team of experts has come up with a plan to use blockchain tracking for trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to avoid the re-imposition of a hard border after Britain leaves the European Union.", "authors": ["John Chalmers", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438339759&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF961B7", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
