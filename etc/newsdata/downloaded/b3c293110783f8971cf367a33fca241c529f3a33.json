I\u2019m worth nearly $111 billion. Don\u2019t tell the Democrats and the unions, though.\u201d\n\nScene: A promise to the people of Flint, Michigan.\n\n\u201cHello, allow me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cElon Musk. You need safe drinking water, I\u2019m going to provide water filters. Your water needs filtering, I\u2019ll provide filtering. Five years, no water. Shameful.\u201d\n\nScene: Outside the D.C. mayor\u2019s and council\u2019s offices.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to testify about the unsafe water at St. Elizabeths mental hospital.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the hearing?\u201d\n\n\u201cVincent Gray said Nov. 20.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen did the water go bad?\n\n\u201cDunno, but we found out a month ago. We can\u2019t drink it, bathe in it or cook with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLead?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Legionella bacteria.\u201d\n\nAt this point, you can tell none of these conversations actually happened \u2014 not precisely anyway. But surely you get the gist.\n\nIn the first scenario, Mr. Bezos does what philanthropists routinely do \u2014 donate to education. Monday, he visited what used to be the District\u2019s most academically prestigious public high school for blacks, Dunbar High. Mr. Bezos, Amazon owner and owner of The Washington Post, surprised Dunbar students and urged them toward engineering studies.\n\nIn the second scene, Mr. Musk, worth $20.9 billion, vowed to provide clean water to residents in Flint, where drinking water has been leaded down by, well, lead pipes \u2014 an unthinkable threat to young minds and compromised immune systems.\n\nThe third scenario is ongoing and truly troubling because D.C. officials promised and spent tax dollars on water projects near St. Elizabeths Hospital, but it seems mentally ill patients and their caretakers weren\u2019t the chief beneficiaries.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt, however, that Democratic leaders and their political caretakers were and still are.\n\nDemocratic minions should be raising Cain. But they aren\u2019t because it\u2019s their fault and they can\u2019t point fingers at Donald Trump or other Republicans.\n\nThey dare not snub Mr. Bezos, either. He owns the \u201cOther Paper\u201d in Washington, which supports their social causes and vice versa.\n\nIt\u2019ll be interesting to see what D.C. officials unveil Tuesday at an important press conference on school enrollment. The sanctuary city mayor is scheduled to deliver the news at MacFarland Middle School, which has a Hispanic-majority enrollment.\n\nNow, you get the point, eh?\n\nFake news doesn\u2019t always spin on what politicians and their friends actually say. Often, it spins on what they don\u2019t want you to know.\n\n\u2981 Deborah Simmons can be contacted at [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
