More than half of the railway stations were severely damaged, and their services suspended during violent protests on Sunday.\n\nOver the weekend, police and protesters exchanged tear gas and petrol bombs while multiple Chinese banks and shops deemed to be pro-Beijing were trashed.\n\nIt was estimated back in early September that MTR has suffered damages of HK$50 million.\n\nShare prices of the company last traded at HK$44.10 by 11:18 PM ET (03:18 GMT), falling about 10% since Hong Kong\u2019s unrest began in early June.", "description": "MTR Corp.
