(AP) - The solar system has a new winner in the moon department.\n\nTwenty new moons have been found around Saturn, giving the ringed planet a total of 82. That beats Jupiter and its 79 moons. The announcement came Monday.\n\nIf it's any consolation to the Jupiter crowd, our solar system's biggest planet - Jupiter - still has the biggest moon. Jupiter's Ganymede is almost half the size of Earth. By contrast, Saturn's 20 new moons are minuscule, each barely 3 miles (5 kilometers) in diameter.\n\nThe Carnegie Institution for Science's Scott Sheppard, who led the discovery team, says 100 even tinier moons may be orbiting Saturn, still waiting to be found.\n\nSheppard and his team used a telescope in Hawaii to spot Saturn's 20 new moons over the summer.", "description": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
