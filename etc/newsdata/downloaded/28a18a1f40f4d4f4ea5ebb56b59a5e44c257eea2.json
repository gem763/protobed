The secretary of homeland security can renew the status if the conditions that necessitated TPS have not improved or if a country is unable to absorb returnees.\n\nAbout 500,000 people have been allowed to stay in the United States as a result of the protected status, and Salvadorans are the largest group, according to federal data.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Trump administration has pushed to limit the use of the program, arguing that disasters that occurred years ago should not be grounds for temporary residency now. The administration regularly deports people to some TPS-designated countries.\n\nTrump has sought to end TPS for nearly all of the 10 nationalities that are protected, while also working to reduce the avenues to asylum and legal permanent residency.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union has sued the administration to challenge its efforts to end TPS protections, accusing it of discrimination. Federal judges have issued preliminary injunctions to halt the deportation of the Salvadorans, Haitians, Hondurans, and Nicaraguans, whose TPS the administration has tried to terminate. The Trump administration has appealed that decision, and advocates expect an appellate court ruling soon.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe largest number of Salvadorans with TPS live in the Washington, D.C., area, followed by Los Angeles, New York and Houston.\n\nMany Salvadorans fear returning to a country that ranks among the most dangerous in the world, a nation that long has experienced high rates of poverty, corruption and gang violence. Salvadorans also send home billions of dollars a year to relatives, a critical infusion that helps keep the economy afloat.\n\nIn a statement, DHS said it arrived at its revised decision on TPS for Salvadorans after considering the possible consequences of mass deportations.\n\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s goal is to create an orderly and responsible process to repatriate Salvadorans and help them return home; however, a sudden inflow of 250,000 individuals to El Salvador could spark another mass migration to the U.S. and reinvigorate the crisis at the southern border,\u201d the agency said in the statement. \u201cTaking into account these concerns, we have decided to provide additional time to work out that plan. We cannot allow the progress the president has made the past several months to be negated.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe agency said Salvadorans who have TPS protection would have their work permits extended through Jan. 4, 2021, and that the government is providing Salvadorans with TPS an additional year after the conclusion of the TPS-related lawsuits to repatriate back to their home country.\n\nKen Cuccinelli, acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, disputed the U.S. ambassador\u2019s description of the arrangement as a TPS extension.\n\n\u201cSome reporting has spoken of \u2018extending TPS,\u2019 \u201d Cuccinelli tweeted. \u201cThat has important legal meaning, and that\u2019s not what happened w/the agreements. Rather, work permits for Salvadorans will be extended for 1 year past resolution of litigation for an orderly wind down period.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDHS framed the TPS decision as part of a larger collaborative security package the United States and El Salvador signed Monday in Washington.\n\nAD\n\nUnder the new arrangement, DHS officials will deploy to El Salvador \u201cto advise and mentor\u201d their police and immigration counterparts, and El Salvador and the United States will \u201cenhance cooperation to prevent and combat crime and other threats to public security through the expansion of biometric data collection and information sharing,\u201d DHS officials said.\n\nThe U.S. government typically provides public justification for TPS extensions by explaining the conditions within a country that make it too dangerous for nationals to return, but the Trump administration offered no such explanation Monday.\n\nAD\n\nThe Trump administration in September signed a separate deal with El Salvador that allows the U.S. government to divert asylum seekers from the southern border to El Salvador as part of a broader strategy to discourage would-be immigrants from seeking refuge in the United States.\n\nAD\n\nImmigrant rights advocates celebrated the reprieve from deportation but criticized what they saw as the administration\u2019s leveraging the safety of hundreds of thousands of immigrants as part of a \u201ctrade\u201d to keep new asylum seekers out of the United States.\n\n\u201cThat is totally unacceptable,\u201d Gustavo Torres, executive director of CASA, an immigrant rights group, told reporters Monday.\n\nNick Miroff contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "The decision reverses course on President Trump\u2019s earlier vow to deport Salvadorans living in the country.", "authors": ["Abigail Hauslohner", "National Reporter Focusing On Immigrant Communities In America", "Maria Sacchetti", "Reporter Covering Immigrant Communities", "Immigration", "Customs Enforcement"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2eojxn_CMSu9XJ3vWsYxbk3cVmI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HUA6DXHZYMI6TCIGVNVWBXUREQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
