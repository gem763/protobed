(Carlos Jasso/Reuters)\n\nIt has consequences that threaten liberty.\n\nWe have a serious governance problem.\n\nOur system is based on separation of powers, because liberty depends on preventing any component of the state from accumulating too much authority \u2014 that\u2019s how tyrants are born. For the system to work, the components have to be able to check each other: The federal and state governments must respect their separate spheres, and the branches of the federal government must be able to rein in a branch that oversteps its authority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe steady federal encroachment on state authority has created an imbalance that probably cannot be rolled back. I want to focus on the collapse of inter-branch checks in the federal government.\n\nThis was the issue I dealt with in Faithless Execution. The thesis was that the Framers feared an agglomeration of power in the presidency they were creating, so they endowed Congress with significant checks on the executive. The ultimate one was impeachment. But this was supposed to be reserved for truly abominable misconduct. Though Madison concluded that impeachment was \u201cindispensable\u201d in light of the damage a rogue president could do, it also came with its own set of problems. Not least, impeachment might give Congress too much power over the executive. It might be invoked out of partisan mischief, rather than serious maladministration. Consequently, impeachment was made to be really hard to do.\n\nThe Framers were sophisticated men, who saw themselves as both students and victims of executive power run amok (as about two minutes\u2019 perusal of the Declaration of Independence elucidates). They understood that governance would involve tussles between the political branches and episodes of overreach \u2014 whether out of incompetence, malevolence, or urgency \u2014 for which the extraordinary impeachment remedy would be gross overkill. Routine disputes involving the propensities of both the legislature and the executive to act outside their authorities would be handled by lesser remedies. Congress, most importantly, was given the power of the purse and significant power over executive agencies (to create them, to limit their authority, and, in the Senate\u2019s case, to approve their leaders).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy argument in Faithless Execution was that this system has broken down, with no repairs on the horizon. The Framers naturally thought congressional control of the executive budget would obviate the need to resort to impeachment. Lawmakers could defund dubious executive initiatives and withhold funds necessary to carry out the president\u2019s priorities; this would pressure the executive branch to comply with statutes as well as congressional demands for information and policy modification. The ultimate question of a president\u2019s fitness would be left to the sovereign \u2014 the American people, exercising the franchise.\n\nIn the last century, however, the federal government and the administrative state have grown enormously, vastly increasing executive power. Meanwhile, congressional funding processes have descended into dysfunction. Rather than budgeting programmatically and with an eye on individual outlays, Congress does mammoth omnibus funding. Spending grows on autopilot, with both the president and lawmakers fearful of being seen as slashing dollars from what the media portray as critical federal functions. The power of the purse is no longer a practical check on executive overreach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat would seem to make impeachment even more indispensable. In the absence of a credible threat of impeachment, lawmakers would have no real check on presidential misconduct \u2014 other than Congress\u2019s capacity to embarrass the administration politically with public hearings and commentary. That is, unless impeachment is a real possibility, presidents are limited only by their own sense of what they can get away with politically. That is barely a check in day-to-day governance. It leaves a wide berth for presidential legislating, lawlessness, and flouting of congressional mandates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImpeachment is a political remedy, not a legal one. With Donald Trump in office and impeachment in play, that adage is repeated so often it seems platitudinous. But it states a vital truth: The mere existence of misconduct that the House might judge impeachable does not mean the Senate \u2014 by a two-thirds supermajority \u2014 would remove a president over it. That fact, coupled with the inherent societal discord impeachment is bound to cause, has historically discouraged the House from commencing impeachment inquiries, even for arguably impeachable offenses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe upshot is that impeachment can never be successfully invoked \u2014 in the sense of both filing articles of impeachment and ousting the president from power \u2014 absent a public consensus, cutting across partisan lines, that a president needs to be removed. Only such a consensus would move members of the House and Senate, who must face voters. Therefore, a public political case has to be made for impeachment. It is not enough to show that a president has overstepped here or there. The public must be convinced that these excesses are so serious, so indicative of unfitness, that it is worth putting the country through the trauma of removing the chief executive.\n\nSignificantly, I contended in the book that the goal is not necessarily to remove the president but to change presidential behavior. To be sure, if misconduct were sufficiently egregious that the president could not credibly carry out his responsibilities any longer, removal would be the only option. But with the power of the purse falling into desuetude, impeachment could address less serious misconduct, too. If a president who is not otherwise unfit pursues unlawful or harmful policies, a credible threat of impeachment might be enough to persuade the president to reverse course \u2013 obviating the need to impeach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Faithless Execution, I laid out various instances of presidential misconduct which could be used to try to build a political case for President Obama\u2019s impeachment. I did it, though, with these caveats: 1) a president should not be impeached in the absence of a public consensus for his removal (an unsuccessful impeachment is likely to encourage more abuse of power); 2) if making the political case induced a president to cease and desist the misconduct, an impeachment effort should generally be aborted since the credible threat of impeachment had served its purpose; and 3) if Congress concluded that impeachment would be so unpopular that a president\u2019s opposition party would suffer politically for invoking it, then it was a rational choice not to seek impeachment \u2014 but a choice that came with the price tag that a rogue president would be encouraged to continue abusing power.\n\nIn the case of President Trump, Democrats are doing what I suggested should be done with President Obama \u2014 building a political case for impeaching a president they deeply oppose. They certainly have the right to do this, yet there is a problem. I may have been right that this revival of impeachment as a credible threat is necessary (in the absence of any other realistic alternative for addressing presidential overreach), but it is also causing serious governance problems. Ignoring them would be irresponsible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be sure, the Democrats\u2019 underlying rationale for impeachment is different from mine. Democrats decided Trump was unfit before he ever entered office and have been seeking any ostensibly plausible reason to vindicate this predisposition in articles of impeachment. By contrast, while I was never an Obama fan, my argument was not that he came to office as an impeachment waiting to happen; it was that, for years, he governed in a manner intentionally designed to undermine the Constitution\u2019s structure, and that he had elevated the interests of foreign powers and actors over the interests of the American people and our security.\n\nThose differences aside, however, we can see that relying on impeachment as the go-to response to presidential overreach \u2014 real or alleged \u2014 has manifest downsides.\n\nTo build their political case, Democrats frame every dispute with President Trump in dire terms: proof of his unfitness and the imperative of removing him. No misstep is too trivial. The president\u2019s supporters, to the contrary, are incentivized to defend the president, even when they should be trying to convince him to change course. They do not want to be seen as implicitly supporting the impeachment effort, so every misstep, even ones that are serious though not egregious enough to warrant impeachment, must be defended rather than corrected. And the president \u2014 especially one with Trump\u2019s persona, which is always to attack and never to confess error \u2014 is encouraged to double down on his mistakes, lest his changing course be seen as an implied admission of misconduct that strengthens the impeachment case.\n\nThe Democratic base demands impeachment. Recently, speaker Nancy Pelosi has come around to the conclusion that it can be done quickly and with minimal political damage to Democrats who hold seats in pro-Trump districts. It thus appears highly likely that the president will be impeached in the coming weeks.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 euphoria will be short-lived. There will be deep, bitter public protest because impeachment, on the facts before us, is objectively foolhardy. Trump\u2019s missteps do not rise to the level of impeachable offenses. If they did, Democrats would not fear voting to conduct the impeachment inquiry, and they would proudly hold their hearings in public with due process, rather than behind closed doors with selective leaking.\n\nMoreover, we are just one year out from an election in which, if Trump is as bad as Democrats say, the voters will remove him. Yet, Trump\u2019s approval rating hovers at around 43 percent, close to what Obama\u2019s was a year before his reelection. Trump could certainly lose, but he stands a decent chance of being reelected. Hence far from a strong public consensus for his removal, there will be zealous public protest against impeachment by a significant segment of the public. Consequently, the Republican-controlled Senate will swiftly reject the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment articles as a partisan stunt \u2014 as precisely the abuse of power the Framers feared. And woe betide the next Democratic president seeking the bipartisan cooperation needed to govern.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur constitutional system will be damaged because impeachment will be discredited. That will not make it any less indispensable than Madison judged it to be. Yet its invocation will be even less likely in some grievous future instance, when a presidential abuse of power actually does imperil the nation. We will have a virtually omnipotent president. As a practical matter, there will be no viable congressional check \u2014 no impeachment, no power of the purse \u2014 to rein the president in. The powers of the competing political branches will be in gross imbalance, making functional separation of powers impossible.\n\nAs the Framers would tell us, that is not a prescription for the preservation of liberty.", "description": "Our constitutional system will be damaged because impeachment will be discredited.
