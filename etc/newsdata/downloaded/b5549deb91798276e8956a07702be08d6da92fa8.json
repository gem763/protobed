He is in the intensive care unit at a Pietermaritzburg hospital.\n\nThe other three who are dead have not been named.\n\nTransport MEC Bheki Ntuli said: \u201cThe road where the crash occurred needs urgent attention and signage and guardrails. A team needs to be set up to look at what measures can be implemented.\n\n\u201cAn intersection that has a taxi rank, police station, shops and municipal offices in one vicinity requires all means of safety to be visible. We will work closely with the local leadership to address the safety challenges in KwaXimba,\u201d said Ntuli.\n\nSpeaking to The Witness on Sunday, Mzulwini, who is subcontracted to build RDP houses in the area, said his employees were travelling to one of the sites in the area at the time of the accident.\n\n\u201cArriving at the scene was a daunting and traumatic experience. All the bodies were already covered, and it was heartbreaking to watch,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are still trying to process this. To lose four employees at once is devastating. It feels like a bad dream, like we are going to wake up tomorrow and find them at work.\u201d\n\nMzulwini said he had just arrived back from Johannesburg on Friday when he was informed that his workers had been involved in a bad accident.\n\n\u201cWhen I arrived at the scene, they were already gone. I couldn\u2019t even recognise my car. It was crushed beyond recognition,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said his brother has broken ribs as well as lung and spinal injuries.\n\nZwelihle Thabethe, Sphesihle\u2019s brother, said the family found his body at a Pinetown mortuary.\n\n\u201cWe were told about the accident at about 9 pm on Friday. We only found the body at the mortuary on Saturday morning,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are all heartbroken. It happened so unexpectedly and it\u2019s all still unbelievable for the family.\u201d\n\n\u201cSphesihle was an all-rounder. He was everything to me. You could ask him for anything, and he would do it,\u201d he said.\n\nMusa Mkhize, the ward councillor in the area, said together with officials from the KZN transport department, they will be meeting with families to discuss funeral arrangements.", "description": "A KwaXimba businessman, Philani Mzulwini, has told of his agony as he saw the bodies of his employees under crushed vehicles in an accident in the area on Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7621/3fda2861eff84cfdb57f7d31a54dafd2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
