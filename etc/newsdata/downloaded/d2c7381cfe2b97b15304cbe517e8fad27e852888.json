In other islands across the Aegean archipelago, close to 30,000 are currently forced to endure conditions human rights groups have described as deplorable.\n\nMitsotakis pledged to move as many as 20,000 to the mainland, insisting \u201cwe don\u2019t want fences or walls\u201d, but he also claimed that most of those now entering Greece were economic migrants rather than refugees.\n\n\u201cToday only two out of 10 are Syrians,\u201d he told parliament, recalling that in 2015, at the height of Europe\u2019s migration crisis, 75% of those landing on Greek shores had come from the war-torn nation.\n\n\u201cSome 50% are Afghans and Pakistanis, who are moved by organised traffickers. Most have the profile of economic migrants, not refugees.\u201d\n\nThe sharp increase has alarmed Brussels and Berlin. Under a landmark accord struck with the EU in March 2016, Ankara agreed to curb flows by enhancing patrols along its Aegean coast. In return, Brussels promised to hand over $6bn in funds to the country.\n\nAmid bitter recriminations over the amount of money given thus far, Turkey\u2019s strongman president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has threatened \u201cto open the gates\u201d and flood Europe with migrants if demands aren\u2019t met.\n\nThe Turkish leader is also pressing for European support in creating a \u201csafe zone\u201d in northern Syria where Ankara aims to resettle some 2 million Syrian refugees. As home to close to 4 million displaced Syrians, Turkey hosts more Syrians than any other place in the world.\n\nWith concerns heightened over the pact\u2019s durability, the European commission\u2019s migration commissioner, Dimitris Avramopoulos, and German interior minister, Horst Seehofer, held talks in Turkey and Greece on Friday as officials called for more deportations of asylum seekers whose applications are rejected.\n\nMitsotakis reiterated his government\u2019s plans to send back 10,000 migrants to Turkey by the end of 2020 \u2013 an eight-fold increase of the number readmitted under the former Syriza administration.\n\nBut the returns \u2013 and plans to create closed, pre-deportation centres \u2013 are controversial.\n\n\u201cWe are very much opposed to this policy of deterrence,\u201d Dimitris Vitsas, the former migration minister under the Syriza government, told the Guardian. \u201cIn every flow there is a mix of migrants and refugees. To say that only migrants are arriving now is very wrong when you are asking for others to equitably share the burden. Does this government honestly think that Hungary and other [central and European countries] will accept to take in more when it is openly saying they are not refugees?\u201d", "description": "Kyriakos Mitsotakis vows to take tougher line on migration by stepping up deportations", "authors": ["Helena Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1230077ba6ada42270e2b97290c8cd46695c7f0a/0_349_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=aff771dbd657b53e0d875e7e8e024a42", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
