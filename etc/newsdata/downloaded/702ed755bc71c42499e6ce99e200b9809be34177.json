REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nPotential rival bids from Blackstone and Fortress would mark another twist in the takeover saga surrounding the once-obscure hotelier, now seen as a test case for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s push for greater transparency and corporate disclosure.\n\nBlackstone last week told Unizo it would launch a tender offer at 5,000 yen ($46.05) a share and said it would consider other options, including initiating a bid, if Unizo did not agree to the conditions by Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe have carefully evaluated and considered Blackstone\u2019s offer. And today all the board members agreed to continue talks with Blackstone as its proposals could help maintain and improve corporate value and secure shareholders benefit,\u201d Unizo said in a statement.\n\nUnizo said separately on Monday it would also continue talks with Fortress, which in August emerged as Unizo\u2019s white-knight bidder. But in September, Unizo had withdrawn its backing for Fortress.\n\nUnizo said it had asked Fortress to raise its offer price to 5,000 yen a share, the same as Blackstone\u2019s offer, from 4,000 yen. Unizo said Fortress had said it was ready to discuss improving the bid.\n\nUnizo had said previously that Fortress did not respond to a\n\nrequest to raise its offer price to 5,000 yen from 4,000 yen. Unizo shares closed at 4,960 yen on Monday.\n\nLast week, Fortress had said it would extend its tender offer period for Unizo for a third time to Nov. 1.\n\nA Tokyo-based Fortress representative declined to comment on Monday. A Hong Kong-based Blackstone spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment.\n\nUnizo has already rejected other buyout proposals from Blackstone as well as one from a \u201clocally renowned\u201d fund that it did not identify.\n\nIn July, Unizo became the target of a hostile bid from a travel agent H.I.S. Co (9603.T).\n\nLast week, Unizo\u2019s biggest shareholder Elliott Management had pushed Unizo to accept Blackstone\u2019s offer, saying the offer of 5,000 yen was beneficial for shareholders.\n\nBut Unizo is continuing to demand certain conditions that both Blackstone and Fortress have not agreed to.\n\nUnizo said it had asked both Blackstone and Fortress to allow it to create an entity that would have veto rights over the timing and method of a future exit of Blackstone.\n\nUnizo also said it had also asked the both funds not to break up the company.", "description": "Unizo Holdings <3258.T> said Monday it would continue talks with Blackstone Group and SoftBank-backed <9984.T> Fortress Investment Group on a potential takeover, raising the possibility of a bid battle between the two global buyout firms.", "authors": ["Junko Fujita", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443327476&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0GX", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
