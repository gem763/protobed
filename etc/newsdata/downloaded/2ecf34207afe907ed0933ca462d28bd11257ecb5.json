REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo\n\nThe \u201cFull House\u201d star is one of 11 parents hit with new charges. Federal prosecutors in Boston say Loughlin conspired to bribe University of Southern California employees to secure the admission of her two daughters.\n\nShe and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, were previously charged with conspiring to commit honest services fraud and money laundering. They now face a new charge of conspiring to commit federal programs bribery.\n\nThe new charges contained in the revised indictment filed against them and the other parents adds to the potential maximum prison terms they each face if convicted. In Loughlin\u2019s case, it jumped from 40 to 45 years, though she would likely get far less.\n\nAll 11 parents have previously pleaded not guilty.\n\n\u201cOur goal from the beginning has been to hold the defendants fully accountable for corrupting the college admissions process through cheating, bribery and fraud,\u201d U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling said.\n\nDefense lawyers did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nProsecutors have charged 52 people with participating in a vast scheme in which wealthy parents conspired with a California college admissions consultant to use bribery and other forms of fraud to secure the admission of their children to top schools.\n\nWilliam \u201cRick\u201d Singer, the consultant, pleaded guilty in March to charges he facilitated cheating on college entrance exams and helped bribe sports coaches at universities to present his clients\u2019 children as fake athletic recruits.\n\nThe 35 parents charged since March include \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d star Felicity Huffman, who last week began serving a 14-day prison term after pleading guilty.\n\nProsecutors allege that Loughlin and Giannulli agreed with Singer to pay $500,000 to have their two daughters named as recruits to the University of Southern California (USC) crew team, even though they did not row competitively.\n\nAt an Aug. 27 hearing, William Trach, their attorney, argued that \u201czero evidence\u201d existed to support the allegations, saying they believed they were providing legitimate donations to USC.\n\nThe new charges came a day after USC confirmed the couple\u2019s daughters, Olivia Jade Giannulli and Isabella Rose Giannulli, were no longer enrolled at the school.\n\nFour other parents, including former Pimco Chief Executive Douglas Hodge and Hercules Capital Inc founder Manuel Henriquez, pleaded guilty on Monday after prosecutors agreed to not bring additional charges against them if they did so.", "description": "Actress Lori Loughlin is facing a new bribery charge after federal prosecutors on Tuesday said they brought additional charges against 18 wealthy parents, university athletic officials and others accused of participating in the largest U.S. college admissions scam ever uncovered.", "authors": ["Nate Raymond", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1443944630&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L1PZ-OCAEN", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
