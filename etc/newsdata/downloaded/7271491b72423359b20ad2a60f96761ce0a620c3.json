Above all, a revival of the Green Movement that nearly toppled the regime following the stolen presidential election of 2009. As Omid Memarian of the Center for Human Rights in Iran noted recently in Foreign Affairs, \u201cThe ferocity with which the authorities have persecuted human rights lawyers, who bring abuses to both domestic and international attention, reflects their fear of exposure and their urgent desire to evade accountability.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the task of helping to revive the Green Movement \u2014 ideally, by providing the type of public and covert support the Reagan administration once gave Solidarity in Poland \u2014 has been made harder by Trump\u2019s general indifference to human-rights issues, to say nothing of his rhetoric and policy toward migrants. Who knew that abandoning American values would have strategic repercussions?\n\nA third implication is that we may be witnessing the beginning of the end of the American era in the Middle East. Trump has boasted of his willingness to support the House of Saud (not least when it\u2019s butchering journalists) and even seemed to be asking for Saudi direction when it came to responding to Saturday\u2019s attacks.\n\nAt the same time, Trump has also made plain his desire to withdraw from Syria and Afghanistan (to Iran\u2019s advantage in both cases), his reluctance to re-establish deterrence with Tehran through a limited military reprisal, and his general skepticism regarding America\u2019s role in policing the global commons. That ought to be music to the ears of America\u2019s quasi-isolationists, including Trump\u2019s critics on the left.\n\nBut it ought to frighten America\u2019s traditional Mideast allies. It\u2019s long been obvious that Saudi Arabia can\u2019t defend itself despite its $68 billion military budget \u2014 and that\u2019s probably just as well. If the U.S won\u2019t defend it, who will? If it\u2019s undefended, what might Iran do next? It\u2019s worth remembering that there is a large and unhappy Shiite minority in eastern Saudi Arabia.\n\nThose who don\u2019t like Saudi Arabia as it is will like it even less when it\u2019s gone.\n\nThat\u2019s a thought that ought to be at the top of Robert O\u2019Brien\u2019s mind as he assumes the role of Trump\u2019s national security adviser \u2014 with the tremulous optimism of a new bride joining Henry VIII at the altar. How the U.S. responds to an unprovoked attack on one of the central pillars of the global economy is a test of American leadership. The consequences of failure will be felt for years.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
