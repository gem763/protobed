Japan's wins over Ireland and Scotland in Pool A went against pre-tournament predictions and saw the hosts emerge atop their pool, forcing second-place Ireland into a quarterfinal against Pool C winner New Zealand.\n\nIf there is an outside influence on the match it is the fact New Zealand's last scheduled pool match against Italy on Saturday was canceled because of Typhoon Hagibis, meaning they will go into the knockout round without a match since Oct. 6 when they beat Namibia 71-9 in a muddling performance.\n\nIreland go into the quarterfinal on the back of a much more emphatic 45-7 win over Samoa on Saturday, achieved with only 14 men. That gives Ireland the better preparation, leaving New Zealand to do the bulk of its lead-up work on the training field.\n\nThe match is one of two \u2014 the other is between Japan and South Africa \u2014 which will involve an evident contrast in styles.\n\nNew Zealand and Japan will both attempt to play an adventurous style, while Ireland and South Africa will attempt to slow down the game.\n\nThat may be an over-simplification but the evidence of the tournament to date is that Ireland may rely strongly on a pick-and-go style, on box kicking and on a swift defensive line.\n\nThe All Blacks showed a new ability to outflank rush defense in their pool win over South Africa but haven't been able to build on that in group matches against weaker opponents. New Zealand's high-tempo style often takes several matches each season to develop both in timing and accuracy. Their almost two-week layoff threatens a return of the rustiness they showed at the start of this season.\n\nAt the same time Ireland does not appear to be as strong as they were last year when it won 11 or 12 tests, beat the All Blacks, won the Six Nations title and was named World Rugby Team of the Year. It's tactical focus has narrowed and it has become more forward-oriented and one-dimensional.\n\nBecause both teams and coaches know each other well, there are likely to be subtle changes in tactics and systems on Saturday.\n\n\"Rugby evolves quickly and the game moves on, stuff changes, systems change,\" Ireland prop Tadhg Furlong said. \"I suppose it gives us confidence that we have had results in the past but at the same time it doesn't guarantee anything.\n\n\"It doesn't mean they're going to rock up and play with the same plan as before. (The All Blacks) are so dangerous, you can't switch off.\"\n\nAll Blacks captain Kieran Read said his team had not been adversely affected by their longer than expected break before the quarterfinals. Their systems are strongly bedded in, their fitness is beyond question and they had used their down time productively.\n\n\"Final games are mental, as well as physical,\" he said. \"The eight teams left are capable of winning the competition, physically and probably mentally.\n\n\"It's about who can step up to the pressure moment.\"\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.
