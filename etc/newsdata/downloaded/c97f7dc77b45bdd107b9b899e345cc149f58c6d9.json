We might know what class they main, or which zones they like best. We might know what state they live in, or what they do for work. We might know them from high school but not have seen them since. But sometimes, when we\u2019re in-character and thousands of miles apart we might realise that the semi-stranger we\u2019re gaming with really, really sucks.\n\nThere are guidelines for breaking up with romantic partners, but it\u2019s uniquely tricky to break up with the edgelords in your Discord group or the guy who goes apeshit when he loses a game of DOTA 2. Whether it\u2019s just one person or an entire online gaming community, sometimes the people we game with make our lives worse. On occasion, it\u2019s a good idea to cut them out and set yourself free.\n\nKnow When Enough Is Enough\n\nThe time you spend gaming after a hard day at school or work is valuable. Most of us play games to relax and enrich our lives. If another person\u2019s behaviour is getting in the way of that, then maybe it\u2019s time to break up.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to nuke a perfectly good gaming relationship after your buddy points out your positioning could have been better last game. Similarly, don\u2019t hold it against an online gaming buddy if they had a bad day at work and don\u2019t have the energy to bring the fun one night. If you\u2019ve spent significant time chatting with someone online while you game, you\u2019ve formed a connection, and leaving them in the dirt for some banal reason is callous.\n\nThat said, common online gaming wisdom maintains that you really don\u2019t owe anyone shit. It\u2019s easy as hell to hit the \u201ceject\u201d button on an online friendship and never think about or hear from that person again. But how do you know when you\u2019re doing it for the right reason?\n\nAsk yourself: Does this person bring you more joy or comfort than they bring you a) frustration, b) annoyance, or c) fear? If yes, then keep queueing up. If no, then consider ending the relationship.\n\nKnow Your Dealbreakers\n\nWe\u2019ve all played with people who are annoying or whom we\u2019d probably not hang out with in real life. Maybe that friend-of-a-friend in your party kind of gets on your nerves when she brags about her gameplay or when he disses the armour you spent so long trying to get, but isn\u2019t, at heart, that bad.\n\nThere are, however, some behaviours that you shouldn\u2019t ever have to tolerate, and you shouldn\u2019t question whether or not to cut the offender loose. Relationship-ending behaviours could include:\n\nConsistent toxicity or abusive language toward you or others\n\nRacism, sexism, homophobia or bigoted language, even in memes\n\nRepeated anger problems or lashing out repeatedly after losing\n\nMaking violent threats\n\nMaking you feel bad about your gameplay every time you game with them\n\nRegularly manipulating you into doing things you don\u2019t want to do, like staying up too late grinding, or helping them with quests after you said no\n\nAttempting to find out more about your IRL life than you feel comfortable sharing\n\nAsking to meet in person after you\u2019ve said no\n\nTalking about you behind your back to other friends or sabotaging your friendships\n\nApproach Them First\n\n\u201cIf you are looking for healthy recommendations, I don\u2019t know lol,\u201d said one extremely online friend of mine when I asked how he\u2019s broken up with online friends. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s always drama or just ghosting.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be that way! Talking to someone about why you\u2019re fed up with them can give them a chance to change. And if they respond poorly, it can give you closure that your decision to end things was a good one.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to address a gaming friend\u2019s flaws immediately after they manifest. If they\u2019ve crossed the line \u2014 used hateful language about you or another member of your group, or made violent threats \u2014 calling that behaviour out in the moment might be necessary.\n\nIn other instances, a more strategic line of action is to wait until everyone\u2019s calmed down \u2014 maybe between games or a day later on Discord. People can come to the conversation with fresh eyes, and it\u2019s likely your friend be more open to what you have to say when their heart rate is down.\n\nIf this is someone you know in real life and their behaviour isn\u2019t on the extreme end of things, you might offer to help them with the behaviour. You can lean on your existing relationship to frame your conversation as something you want to address together so that you can keep being friends.\n\nRemember that communicating clearly is more likely to get you what you need, even though it may feel scary to be so straightforward with a friend. Don\u2019t write a manifesto about why they suck. Just succinctly point out the behaviour and explain how it makes you feel. Say you\u2019re open to chatting about it more if you, in fact, are, but also be firm that you\u2019re not open to debating the merits of racist memes or creepy flirting.\n\nHere\u2019s an example: \u201cHey buddy, I wanted to talk to you about something a little awkward. Last night\u2019s game got me thinking \u2014 I\u2019ve noticed that whenever you lose, you get really upset. It sucks to see you upset because I care about you and I don\u2019t want you to feel that way. It also can stress me out a little when you flame teammates or yell into the mic. I\u2019m just trying to have fun, so I\u2019d love if we could talk about ways to handle your temper.\u201d\n\nIf it\u2019s someone you don\u2019t know in real life, approaching them about an issue can be trickier. We don\u2019t always share the same values as people we meet randomly online. In a lot of ways, that\u2019s a beautiful thing because it means we befriend people we might have overlooked at the local pub. In other ways, you don\u2019t have a lot of context for why someone behaves the way they do.\n\nIf their behaviour is something that\u2019s straight-up unacceptable to you, you should tell them clearly to cut it out. Here\u2019s an example of how to broach that: \u201cHey buddy, let me know when you have a moment to talk about something a little sensitive. . . I\u2019ve noticed that whenever there\u2019s a woman on our team, you kind of single them out and hit on them, like last night when you did [specific example]. I get that you want to have fun, but I\u2019m not really down with that. It just feels kind of creepy. Would you mind keeping it to yourself?\u201d\n\nAside from differing values, when people game online, they often detach themselves from the standards they\u2019re expected to live by in daily life. People don\u2019t always consider what they\u2019re saying when there are no repercussions for their behaviour. That\u2019s not an excuse. But it can help you strategize on how to talk to them once you\u2019ve decided you\u2019re fed up. It\u2019s not your job to educate people on what good and bad behaviour is. But sometimes online, people might not understand how they\u2019re coming off.\n\nHere\u2019s an example: \u201cI appreciate your sense of humour, but sometimes, I feel like you take it a little far. Yesterday, you thought it was funny to spam /all chat with all of the lyrics to \u201cHey Mamma\u201d by The Black Eyed Peas. That was a little annoying for me. I\u2019m hoping you could tone it down on the shitposts because it\u2019s kind of distracting.\u201d\n\nHopefully your conversation will go well, and they\u2019ll change their behaviour. If it doesn\u2019t end well, you have a few options:\n\nGhost\n\nYou gave them a chance, maybe many chances, but nothing sticks. Leave. Leave the Discord group. Leave the Linkshell or guild. Stop responding to their texts. Unfriend and block them on Battle.net. Switch servers. Fade into the darkness.\n\nIt will sting for a little bit. You might feel a ping of sadness. You\u2019ll miss having that buddy to rank Marvel movies with or queueing up with the one person who actually supplements your tanking. Most of the time, that stinging feeling won\u2019t last. Other people will replace them in your life. In a year, you\u2019ll be like, Sorry, who?\n\nExplain Yourself; Then Ghost\n\nYou don\u2019t owe anyone an explanation of why you\u2019re leaving if you felt strong enough in the first place to go. Empathy is a bitch, though. You\u2019d feel bad, confused, and worried if someone you gamed with every night just dropped off the face of the earth.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to leave a goodbye message. A lot of people just lie and say they got busy with school, a new relationship, or general life stuff. I\u2019m not going to suggest lying, but it is certainly the easy way out. The alternative is to write a message like this to your Discord group:\n\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry to say this, but I\u2019ll be moving on from here. Wishing you all the best.\u201d\n\nOr to a specific person:\n\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry to say this, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a good idea for us to game together anymore. I let you know what was up and nothing changed. Wishing you the best.\u201d\n\nSometimes a person\u2019s behaviour isn\u2019t just damaging to you but to others, too. If that\u2019s the case, you can leave a message like this before going:\n\n\u201cHey, sorry to say, but I\u2019m moving on from the guild. I\u2019m not ok with the way you guys talk about [X] and this just isn\u2019t for me.\u201d\n\nTake Your Allies With You\n\nThis isn\u2019t as sneaky as it sounds. If there\u2019s a rift in your group \u2014 some people are cool with edgy memes while you and others aren\u2019t \u2014 then it\u2019s ok to communicate with people who agree with you about branching off. \u201cHey all, I know this sounds really harsh, but a lot of us in here aren\u2019t and haven\u2019t been ok with [X]. We tried to sort it out, but we\u2019re at an impasse. The best way forward for us is to start our own group. Feel free to contact me over there and thanks for understanding.\u201d\n\nSome people who decide to stay in the original group might view this as undermining. That\u2019s ok, though. You and others can rebuild a more positive gaming community together. Once you do that, set some ground rules so things don\u2019t get out of hand again.", "description": "We don\u2019t always really know the people we game with online.
