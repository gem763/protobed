The attack underscored the record numbers of civilians dying in the country\u2019s 18-year war.\n\nAttahullah Khogyani, spokesman for the governor of Nangarhar province, said the militant attack wounded 36 others. He said it was not immediately clear whether the mosque was attacked by a suicide bomber or it was some other type of bombing.\n\n\u201cBoth men and children are among those killed and wounded in the attack,\u201d he said.\n\nSediq Sediqqi, spokesman for the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, criticised the attack on his official Twitter account. \u201cThe Afghan government strongly condemns today\u2019s suicide attack in a mosque in Nangarhar province,\u201d he tweeted.\n\n'They were all killed in front of my eyes': the brutal cost of war in Afghanistan Read more\n\n\u201cThe Taliban and their partners heinous crimes continue to target civilians in time of worship,\u201d he added.\n\nNo one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but both the Taliban and Islamic State are active in eastern Afghanistan, especially Nangarhar province.\n\nHowever, the Taliban\u2019s spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid condemned the attack in a statement and called it a serious crime.\n\nZahir Adil, spokesman for the public health department in Nangarhar province, said 23 of the wounded were transferred to Jalalabad, the provincial capital, and the rest were being treated in the Haskamena district clinic.\n\nThe violence comes a day after a UN report said Afghan civilians were dying in record numbers in the country\u2019s increasingly brutal war, noting that more civilians died in July than in any previous month since the UN began keeping statistics.\n\n\u201cCivilian casualties at record-high levels clearly show the need for all parties concerned to pay much more attention to protecting the civilian population, including through a review of conduct during combat operations,\u201d said Tadamichi Yamamoto, the UN secretary general\u2019s special representative for Afghanistan.\n\nThe report said pro-government forces caused 2,348 civilian casualties \u2013 1,149 killed and 1,199 wounded \u2013 a 26% increase from the same period in 2018.\n\nThe report said 2,563 civilians were killed and 5,676 were wounded in the first nine months of this year. Insurgents were responsible for 62% of all civilian casualties. July to September were the deadliest months so far this year.\n\nEfforts to restart talks to end Afghanistan\u2019s 18-year war increased earlier this month. President Donald Trump had last month declared the talks \u201cdead\u201d, blaming a surge in violence by the Taliban that included the killing of a US soldier.\n\nThe US peace envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, visited Pakistan and met the Taliban\u2019s top negotiator, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. Baradar is a co-founder of the hardline Islamic movement and was head of a Taliban delegation to Islamabad.\n\nUS officials said Khalilzad was only in the Pakistani capital to follow up on talks he held in September in New York with Pakistani officials, including the prime minister, Imran Khan. They insisted he was not in Pakistan to restart US-Taliban peace talks.\n\nIn western Herat province, six civilians, including four children, were killed on Thursday when their vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb, said Jelani Farhad, spokesman for the provincial governor. He added that five other civilians were wounded in the attack in the Zawal district.", "description": "Militant attack caused roof to collapse as worshippers met for Friday prayers", "authors": ["Associated Press In Kabul"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a42763439ce6f4893286bad75af2fb6b1dc34e9/0_0_4519_2712/master/4519.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f7431b17d65a76e95b8d8a41045c7468", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
