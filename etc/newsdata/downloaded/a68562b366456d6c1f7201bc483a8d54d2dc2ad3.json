The financial sector is now roughly 3% below the all-time peak reached before the financial crisis in 2007 and retested in February of this year.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note, the benchmark for many consumer loans, rose for a second consecutive trading session to 1.7%, one-quarter of a percentage point above the three-year low recorded last Wednesday.\n\nWrite to Rob Curran at rob.curran@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 10, 2019 17:25 ET (21:25 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
