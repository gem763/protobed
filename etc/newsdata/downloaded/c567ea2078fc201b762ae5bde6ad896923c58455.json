He clustered left-handers at the top and in the middle of his lineup to get them more at-bats against starter An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez and then, when Corbin entered, sprung his plan.\n\nCorbin, who gave up just three hits to Los Angeles in the first game of the series, emerged from the bullpen to start the sixth inning. So Roberts flipped his lineup, pinch-hitting his weaker left-handers with right-handers David Freese, Chris Taylor and Enrique Hern\u00e1ndez. He trusted his stronger left-handers to come through, and they did. The result was a seven-run sixth inning \u2014 every run came with two-strike counts and two outs for the inning \u2014 en route to a 10-4 win that has Los Angeles one win away from advancing.\n\n[Patrick Corbin, Nationals get rocked by Dodgers in sixth inning, lose NLDS Game 3, 10-4]\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think that we were going to be glad that Corbin was coming into the game after Game 1, but sometimes that\u2019s what a team needs,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t plan for seven-run innings, but after the first five tonight and to see us kind of get back to what we do best was really good to see,\u201d Roberts said.\n\nOutside of Max Muncy and Justin Turner, the Dodgers\u2019 prized bats were dormant through S\u00e1nchez\u2019s five-inning appearance, continuing a trend for the series. Bellinger was 0 for 8 with five strikeouts. Left fielder A.J. Pollock was 0 for 9 with seven strikeouts. Los Angeles had worked S\u00e1nchez for 28 pitches in the first inning, loading the bases only to strand all three runners, managing just one hit in this series with runners in scoring position to that point.\n\nThe biggest offensive outburst of the series naturally started with arguably its best player, Bellinger getting his first hit of the series with a line drive to right field with two outs in the sixth.\n\n\u201cHe wants to be that MVP guy for us that he\u2019s been all year,\u201d Turner said. \u201cThat at-bat kind of unlocked him. He got down 0-2, took some tough pitches, got the 3-2 count, fouled off a couple more tough pitches and found a way to get on there. It just seemed like that kind of got the ball rolling.\u201d\n\nThen after shortstop Corey Seager and Pollock both struck out, Roberts turned to Freese for Gavin Lux, and Freese was clutch as he has a reputation for being this time of year. He singled to right, advancing Bellinger to third. On the next at-bat, Russell Martin, the team\u2019s backup catcher who hit .220 this season, doubled, driving in both runs to lift the Dodgers to their first lead of the game 3-2.\n\nTaylor stepped up to the plate for starting pitcher Hyun-Jin Ryu and earned a four-pitch walk to have runners on first and third for Roberts\u2019s next pinch-hitter \u2014 Hern\u00e1ndez. He doubled on a sharp line drive to left field, bringing home Martin and Taylor and flipping the game on its head.\n\n[The Nationals\u2019 bullpen moves in Game 3 were a disaster. That doesn\u2019t mean they were wrong.]\n\n\u201cWe all know that we chased a lot of his sliders in the dirt in L.A.,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cFor us tonight, it was about staying simple with the approach \u2014 hit whatever\u2019s over the plate and not trying to expand down.\u201d\n\nThe next left-hander, Muncy, had already made his mark on the game with a solo home run in the fifth, so Corbin intentionally walked him. That was the last batter Corbin faced, but it left two runners on base for reliever Wander Suero, who was welcomed into the game with a three-run homer by Turner, the exclamation point on a seven-run inning for Los Angeles. It was a show of the Dodgers\u2019 depth and versatility throughout their lineup, from the stars who did as they were expected to the reserves who delivered in big spots.\n\n\u201cOffense is definitely contagious,\u201d Turner said. \u201cWe all caught it that inning.\u201d", "description": "Los Angeles stayed patient and the result was a seven-run sixth inning.", "authors": ["Isabelle Khurshudyan", "Reporter Covering The Washington Capitals", "October At Am", "Isabelle Khurshudyan Covers The Washington Capitals.
