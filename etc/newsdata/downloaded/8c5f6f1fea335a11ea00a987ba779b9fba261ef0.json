And I\u2019m here.\u2018\n\nConscious that such a massive car might run somewhat contrary to the more environmentally friendly mood of the modern world, BMW has made an electric hybrid version of the 7 series to slightly ease owners' concerns.\n\nI've been to the global launch event hosted in Portugal to get behind the wheel of the new Bavarian limo - and also kicked my feet up in the back seats to get the full chauffeured experience.\n\nGrilling: Ray Massey tries BMW's new 7 Series limo - the car with a biggest nostrils on the planet\n\nFirst things first, let's get back to the elephant in the room - or, in this case, the grille on the saloon.\n\nIt may appear too over-the-top and cartoonish for some \u2013 it\u2019s 40 per cent larger and takes a leaf from the monumental presence of the grille that adorns a Rolls-Royce, also part of the BMW family \u2013 but it is expected to play well in China where the average age of 7 Series owners is just 38.\n\nBut is it too brash for more conservative British and European buyers? Time will tell.\n\nAppealing to younger tech-savvy drivers has also been the driving force to ensuring that the new generation 7 Series is well connected to owners who want to be online and on social media.\n\nThere is, however, a bit of softening from the clever battery-powered hybrid tech that makes this a more frugal and less environmentally harmful ride \u2013 whether you are driving up front or being chauffeur-driven in the back.\n\nThe new 745Le xDrive hybrid, with its extended wheelbase and intelligent all-wheel drive and costing from \u00a383,560, is a smooth operator with some very sporty performance when needed.\n\nThe extended 7 Series might be a car you buy to be driven in, but Ray Massey found first hand that it has plenty of performance from the driver's seat\n\nThe plug-in hybrid model can be driven in electric-only mode for a maximum of 34 miles before the batteries are depleted\n\nBMW claims it can return over 100mpg, so it will be cheap to run - though in reality it's unlikely to match those claims. With CO2 emissions of just 52g/km, it'll be a front-running company car for business execs\n\nAs a hybrid, the near silent electric mode from start gives an elegant beginning to any journey.\n\nWill it fit in my garage? BMW 745Le xDrive plug-in hybrid On sale: April 13 Price: \u00a383,560 Length: 5,260mm Width: 1,902mm Height: 1,476mm 0-62mph: 5.1 seconds Top speed: 155mph (electronically limited) Petrol engine: 3.0 litre inline six-cylinder (286hp) Electric motor: 113hp Electric motor: 113hp Battery: High voltage 12kWh Lithium ion Total power: 394hp Gears: 8-speed Steptronic automatic (with manual paddle-shift) Top speed in ELECTRIC only mode: 87mph Top electric-only speed in HYBRID mode: 68mph (13mph faster than predecessor) Fuel consumption: 105mpg to 118mpg (unlikely to be achieved in real world driving) CO2 emissions: 52g/km Range in electric-only mode: 34 miles Fuel-tank: 46-litres\n\nIndeed, it will travel up to a claimed 34 miles in zero-emissions mode where the maximum top speed is 87mph.\n\nIf you are in mix\u2019n\u2019match hybrid mode, the executive cruiser-bruiser will go up to 68mph in electric power\u2013 some 13mph faster than predecessor models \u2013 before drawing on the 3.0-litre inline six cylinder petrol engine.\n\nThis 3.0-litre engine develops 286hp and is linked to a 113hp electric motor. Together they total 394hp (not 399hp as some energy is lost in the transfer) \u2013 equivalent to four Ford Fiestas.\n\nBut that's enough of about how it drives. What most buyers of this extended saloon will want to know is how it feels being driven.\n\nSitting in the back is a very comfortable and serene experience, with some exceptionally floaty and soft headrests amid the quilted Nappa leather.\n\nIt is like flying business class. Sit back and read the newspapers \u2013 if you\u2019re old school \u2013 or select some music or scan the internet from one of the two main rear screens.\n\nIf you really feel impelled to do some work in-transit, a clever laptop table pops out from the central rear console and slides across your lap. Or if you fancy a snooze, the rear seats recline to a suitably relaxing incline.\n\nThere\u2019s a seat massage, interior blinds to suite the level of sunshine or the level of privacy you require, and all manner of electronic wizardry, from connected sat-nav, digital dashboard screens and diversions, wireless phone charging, and a removable and portable seven-inch touchscreen.\n\nBut I really did also drive the car \u2013 as indeed do many buyers who want the 7 Series as much for the driving enjoyment as for the chauffeur-driven experience in the rear. And it doesn\u2019t disappoint.\n\nThere are three settings: Sport, Hybrid and Electric. Pressing the Hybrid button twice engages Hybrid Eco pro which reduces fuel consumption even more.\n\nMost of those interested in the 7 Series will want to know what it's like from the back. Our man Ray tried it out for size\n\nFor its size - especially in long-wheel-base spec - the new BMW 7 Series is surprisingly nimble\n\nIs that whopping grille too brash for more conservative British and European buyers? Time will tell\n\nBut press the pedal to the metal in Sport and you experience sports-car-like acceleration from rest to 62mph in just 5.1 seconds, up to a top speed (where permitted such as German Authobahns) limited electronically to 155mph.\n\nAnd it\u2019s pretty nimble for a car of this size, taking twisty mountain roads with ease and having a real burst of speed and acceleration on long straights when required or desired.\n\nThere are manual-shift paddles on the steering wheel if you want some even more engaging driving.\n\nFrom sitting in the back you can use the removable and portable seven-inch touchscreen to view the navigation screen the driver sees and adjust the temperature and music played in the cabin\n\nThe electric motor is integrated into the slick and seamless eight-speed Steptronic automatic gearbox which also acts as a power generator when you are braking or coasting.\n\nThe regenerative energy collected is fed back into the lithium ion battery which, as well as supplying electric power to the wheels, can also power the car\u2019s auxiliary air conditioning system and on-board electrics.\n\nThis all helps keep fuel consumption down to between 105mpg and 118mpg providing of course that you do actually charge up your plug-in hybrid before departure.\n\nThey are some bold claims - and fuel economy figures motorists are highly unlikely to be able to match when driving every day.\n\nOfficial CO2 emissions are as low as 52g/km, making this a low rate motor for company car drivers.\n\nThe new 7 Series goes on sale this month. Prices range from \u00a369,430 up to a hefty \u00a3139,000\n\nDon't get in its way - with a grille this big it might suck-up small cars cowering in its path\n\nThe battery is under the rear seats and the 46-litre fuel tank above the rear axle, meaning only slightly less space in the hybrid\u2019s already pretty cavernous boot.\n\nNot everyone wants or needs a chauffeur or the extra legroom in the back.\n\nSo for those who prefer to drive themselves, the standard length 745e hybrid costing \u00a376,815 has similar acceleration (just 0.1 seconds slower) and the same limited top speed, but lower CO2 emissions (48g/km) and better fuel consumption (123-141mpg) than the extended wheelbase.\n\nOverall, the new 7 Series range on sale from this month is priced from \u00a369,430 on the road for the 730d \u2013 likely to be the biggest seller because of corporate business fleet customers - up to a hefty \u00a3139,000 for the Motorsport-enhanced M760Li xDrive.\n\nWith those enormous grille nostrils, the M760Li should be able to snort-up most of the traffic in its way.", "description": "You can be mean, lean and also slightly green when travelling business class in BMW\u2019s feisty new flagship plug-in hybrid 7 Series.
