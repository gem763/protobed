His family cannot afford a private tutor as financial resources are limited.\n\nLast few years have seen enormous consumption of high-speed data by Indians due to affordable 4G internet, the use of high-speed internet will be further boosted by the introduction of 5G technology. 5G will change the world even more profoundly than 3G and 4G; that it will be as revolutionary as electricity or the automobile, benefitting entire economies and entire societies.\n\nEconomists estimate the global economic impact of 5G in new goods and services will reach $12 trillion by 2035 as 5G moves mobile technology from connecting people to people and information, towards connecting people to everything.\n\n5G will impact every industry \u2013 autos, healthcare, manufacturing and distribution, emergency services, and education just to name a few. And 5G is purposely designed so that these industries can take advantage of cellular connectivity in ways that wouldn\u2019t have been possible before, and to scale upwards as use of 5G expands. 5G is set to have a profound effect on countries\u2019 economic performance and GDP. In 2016, mobile technologies and services generated 4.4 per cent of GDP globally, equating to about $3.3 trillion in economic value. This has been estimated to grow to over $4.2 trillion by 2020, or 4.9 per cent of global GDP, as faster mobile connectivity continues to drive gains in productivity and efficiency.\n\n5G is a technological paradigm shift, analogous to the shift from typewriter to computer. 5G has the potential to unlock up to $12.3 trillion of revenue across a broad range of industries. The internet economy in India is expected to touch the USD 155 billion mark by 2018, contributing to around 5% to the GDP. It is believed that India\u2019s digital economy has the potential to reach USD 1 trillion by the year 2025 driven by increased proliferation of smartphones, increased internet penetration, growth of mobile broadband, growth of data and social media.\n\nThe World Bank estimates that for every 10% increase in broadband penetration rates, per capita GDP grows 1.38 percentage points for low- and middle-income countries.\n\n5G networks are expected to be at least 100 times faster than current 4G networks and cut latency to less than one-thousandth of a second. Cellular technology innovation has been instrumental in creating wealth in recent years and has contributed significantly to global economic growth, either directly or indirectly. Each mobile network generation, including 2G, 3G, and 4G, has transformed consumers\u2019 lifestyles and has enabled businesses to deploy new tools to enhance productivity and work efficiency.\n\nIt\u2019s the introduction of new technologies over time that\u2019s been responsible for the major developments that have impacted the flow of money and goods throughout economic history. These innovations serve as the cornerstone for new jobs, industries, and even lifestyles.\n\n5G network would also help in achieving UN SDG\u2019s, consider Sustainable Development Goal 4 \u2013 to \u201censure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all\u201d \u2013 which affects the achievement of all other SDGs, beginning with ending poverty. As the UN Development Programme\u2019s Multidimensional Poverty Index shows, of all of the deprivations that affect the poor \u2013 from inadequate nutrition to lack of access to clean water and sanitation \u2013 lack of quality education is among the biggest obstacles to upward social mobility.\n\nEnsuring quality education is also closely tied to the goal of achieving gender equality (SDG5). In India, women lag men in educational attainment by one year, on average. Unsurprisingly, men earn an average of 1.6 times more than women. More educated women have better health practices, marry later, and have fewer children. This leads to better maternal and child health. Furthermore, the children of educated mothers are more likely to attend school themselves, creating a virtuous cycle of intergenerational progress\n\n5G technology can offer improved remote-learning opportunities. This would eliminate the need for large-scale land use and construction while keeping procurement processes confined largely to investments in the technology itself. These investments should not be too difficult to secure, given that 5G\u2019s applications extend well beyond the education sector. But 5G would greatly improve the quality of such learning, because of its sheer speed \u2013 up to 100 times faster than 4G \u2013 which would allow for instant interactivity, without much energy consumption. This means that, rather than watching videos of distant teachers, students in remote African villages would be able to participate in classes in real-time.\n\nCutting-edge tech can be a fantastic learning tool, making subjects more engaging, helping children who struggle to learn new concepts from textbooks, and bringing education into the homes of kids without easy access to a physical classroom.\n\nRemote learning has already begun to take off in some parts of the world. But 5G would greatly improve the quality of such learning, because of its sheer speed \u2013 up to 100 times faster than 4G \u2013 which would allow for instant interactivity, without much energy consumption. This means that, rather than watching videos of distant teachers, students in remote villages would be able to participate in classes in realtime.\n\n5G-enabled classrooms could include a holographic teacher who can beam in to lead discussions on specialized topics; seamless virtual reality experiences that can help students with diverse learning needs better engage, or connected devices that could help close gaps in education for international students.", "description": "Ashok belongs to a low-income family and is preparing for his 12th class exams by studying on YouTube.
