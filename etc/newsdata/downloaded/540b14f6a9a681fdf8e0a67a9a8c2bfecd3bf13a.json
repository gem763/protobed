And a source told the Mirror that the motorway would not be back to normal today as removing the infrastructure takes around 48 hours.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nA Highways England spokesperson said: \"We are keeping the deployment of Operation Brock continually under review and are ready to stand it down if it will not be needed.\n\n\"Any decision to de-activate Operation Brock will be taken jointly, and we are in constant contact with the Government and our partners in Kent.\"\n\nOperation Brock was initially deployed on March 25, four days ahead of the first planned Brexit date.\n\nIt was deactivated about three weeks later following the delay to the UK's withdrawal from the EU, but the steel barriers for the contraflow system and 50mph speed limit remain in place.\n\nIt comes after Boris Johnson pledged to spend \u00a3100m on the biggest advertising campaign since World War 2 to tell people to \"get ready\" for October 31.\n\nIt involved an \"unprecedented marketing blitz\" on billboards, radio and television to prepare for a no deal departure.\n\n(Image: Christopher Furlong)\n\nDowning Street was unable to say today how much of the \u00a3100million had been spent.\n\nJosh Hardie, CBI Deputy Director-General, said: \u201cBusiness will be relieved that common sense has prevailed and a damaging no deal exit has been avoided this year.\n\n\"But uncertainty remains high. It is vital - this time - the extra time leads to a deal. All politicians must break the gridlock and let the country move on.\n\n\u201cThen economic evidence must be the guiding light as the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU develops.\n\n\"Firms are keen to see commitments to regulatory alignment, frictionless trade and the UK\u2019s all-important services sector, protecting the UK economy over the longer-term.\"", "description": "Operation Yellowhammer and Operation Brock are still in force - and No10 was unable to say how much of a \u00a3100m no-deal advertising budget has been blown", "authors": ["Nicola Bartlett", "Dan Bloom", "Image", "Pa", "Christopher Furlong"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20743626.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Brexit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
