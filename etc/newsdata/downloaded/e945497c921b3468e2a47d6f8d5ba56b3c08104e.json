State television lauded the September 2010 meeting, saying Hu lavished praise on the tycoon for contributing to the city\u2019s prosperity and stability.\n\nThese days, as Hong Kong reels from months of violent demonstrations, China\u2019s government is weaving a much harsher narrative around the billionaires who dominate the business and politics of the city. In recent weeks, it\u2019s linked them to the rising inequality it blames for the social unrest, a new stance that threatens the close ties Hong Kong dynasties have forged with Beijing.\n\nWhile most of Hong Kong\u2019s wealthiest families have sprawling property holdings, they also dominate industries from telecommunications to retail, giving them outsize influence. The 20 Hong Kong tycoons tracked by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index -- including moguls like Li and property magnate Lee Shau Kee -- have a combined net worth of more than $200 billion. So any shift in China\u2019s posture toward those wealthy families has the potential in coming years to ripple through the city\u2019s $360 billion economy.\n\nIn a scathing article posted on social media earlier this month, China\u2019s Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, the nation\u2019s most powerful law-enforcement body, lashed out at Hong Kong\u2019s property tycoons for \u201choarding land and grabbing money.\u201d Next, the Communist Party\u2019s mouthpiece, the People\u2019s Daily, said the government should take away land from Hong Kong developers through compulsory acquisition.\n\n\u201cIt is very clear that Beijing\u2019s attitude toward Hong Kong\u2019s property tycoons has changed,\u201d said Joseph Wong, who was secretary for commerce, industry and technology under the city\u2019s former leader, or chief executive, Donald Tsang.\n\nChina appears to be encouraging state-backed enterprises to expand in Hong Kong, a special administrative region, and, over the coming years, these companies likely will play a leading role in industries the tycoons have controlled, Wong said.\n\nChina Mobile Ltd., the mainland\u2019s biggest carrier, has increased its subscriber base in Hong Kong by more than 50% since 2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. Mainland developers, including China Resources Land Ltd., bought almost 60% of the residential land sold by Hong Kong\u2019s government in the first half of this year.\n\nRepresentatives at family holding companies of Li and Lee didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nWhile much of their power comes from these informal relationships, members of the wealthiest families in Hong Kong also have official positions, including on the election committee of about 1,200 people that selects the city\u2019s leader. Hong Kong business people sit on the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference, an advisory body that meets once a year in Beijing.\n\nChinese leaders were friendly toward the tycoons when the mainland economy was opening up because they wanted to encourage them to invest across the border, said Ding Yifan, a former senior government researcher who now teaches world economy at Beijing Foreign Studies University.\n\n\u201cNow that things have hit the fan, they realize there are many things quite unfair in Hong Kong,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course they need to deal with these problems.\u201d\n\nHong Kong\u2019s protests erupted in June in response to a proposed bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. They\u2019ve continued even after that legislation was shelved, with protesters making other demands, including universal suffrage and an investigation into police actions toward demonstrators.\n\nChina\u2019s office for Hong Kong and Macau affairs this month said it would support Hong Kong\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, in efforts to address social problems such as the housing shortage, the large wealth gap and the difficulty in upward social mobility. Hong Kong has the world\u2019s least affordable housing.\n\nAt the end of July, about half of Hong Kong\u2019s new apartments for sale came from five of its largest developers -- including the Li family\u2019s CK Asset Holdings Ltd.; Henderson Land Development Co. of the Lee family; and Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd., controlled by the Kwok family -- according to an analysis of data from realtor Centaline Property Agency.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Less than a decade ago, Hong Kong\u2019s richest man, Li Ka-shing, was granted an exclusive audience with China\u2019s then-President Hu Jintao, a rare honor.
