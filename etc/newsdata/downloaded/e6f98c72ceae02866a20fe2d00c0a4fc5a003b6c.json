As a boy, Elijah's dad made him shine his shoes and tie his tie, and they\u2019d go to the airport\u2014not to board the airplanes, but to watch others do it. I remember Elijah telling me this story. Robert would say, \u201cI have not flied. I may not fly, but you will fly one day. We can\u2019t afford it right now, but you will fly.\u201d\n\nHis grandmother\u2014as Elijah related\u2014and as grandmothers do, was a little more impatient with her advice. Your daddy, she said, \u201che\u2019s been waiting and waiting for a better day. Don\u2019t you wait.\u201d And Elijah did not wait. Against all odds, Elijah earned his degrees. He learned about the rights that all people in this country are supposed to possess, with a little help, apparently, from Perry Mason. Elijah became a lawyer to make sure that others had rights, and his people had their God-given rights, and from the statehouse to the House of Representatives, his commitment to justice and the rights of others would never, ever waver.\n\nRead: Elijah Cummings, reluctant partisan warrior\n\nElijah\u2019s example: a son of parents who rose from nothing to carve out just a little something, a public servant who toiled to guarantee the least of us have the same opportunities that he had earned. A leader who once said he would die for his people, even as he lived every minute for them\u2014his life validates the things we tell ourselves about what\u2019s possible in this country. Not guaranteed, but possible. The possibility that our destinies are not preordained. But rather, through our works, and our dedication, and our willingness to open our hearts to God\u2019s message of love for all people, we can live a purposeful life. That we can reap a bountiful harvest. That we are neither sentenced to wither among the rocks nor assured a bounty, but we have a capacity, the chance, as individuals and as a nation, to root ourselves in good soil.\n\nElijah understood that. That\u2019s why he fought for justice. That\u2019s why he embraced his beloved community of Baltimore. That\u2019s why he went on to fight for the rights and opportunities of forgotten people all across America, not just in his district. He was never complacent, for he knew that without clarity of purpose and a steadfast faith, and the dogged determination demanded by our liberty, the promise of this nation can wither. Complacency, he knew, was not only corrosive for our collective lives, but for our individual lives.\n\nIt has been remarked that Elijah was a kind man. I tell my daughters\u2014and I have to say, listening to Elijah\u2019s daughters speak, that got me choked up. I am sure those of you who have sons feel the same way, but there is something about daughters and their fathers. And I was thinking, I would want my daughters to know how much I love them, but I would also want them to know that being a strong man includes being kind. That there is nothing weak about kindness and compassion. There is nothing weak about looking out for others. There is nothing weak about being honorable. You are not a sucker to have integrity and to treat others with respect. I was sitting here and I was just noticing The Honorable Elijah E. Cummings and, you know, this is a title that we confer on all kinds of people who get elected to public office. We\u2019re supposed to introduce them as honorable.", "description": "\u201cHis commitment to justice and the rights of others would never, ever waver.\u201d", "authors": ["Christian Paz"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/AP_19298608585172/facebook.jpg?1572024453", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
