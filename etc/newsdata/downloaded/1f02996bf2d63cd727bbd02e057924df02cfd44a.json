REUTERS/Marina Depetris\n\nGENEVA (Reuters) - A Syrian Kurdish man in his 30s set himself on fire outside the United Nations refugee agency headquarters in Geneva on Wednesday and was quickly airlifted to hospital after the flames were extinguished, police said.\n\nThe man, who resides in Germany, was flown by helicopter to the specialized burns unit at the university hospital in Lausanne where he is receiving treatment, Geneva police spokesman Silvain Guillaume-Gentil said.\n\n\u201cGiven his state, it was impossible to ask him about his motive, but we imagine that it was the political situation.\u201d\n\nTurkish forces launched an offensive into northern Syria on Oct 9 to drive Kurdish militia away from the border region. Russia and Turkey reached an accord on Tuesday calling for the withdrawal of Syrian Kurdish YPG forces from the entire length of Syria\u2019s northeastern frontier with Turkey.\n\n\u201cWe are saddened and shocked (about) an incident of self-immolation that happened in front of our Geneva headquarters this morning,\u201d said Andrej Mahecic, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).\n\nThe man had set himself ablaze and then tried to enter the UNHCR building but security officers and medical services intervened and the fire was put out, Mahecic said, adding: \u201cWe hope he will recover.\u201d\n\nThe UNHCR building is located across the street from a collective shelter for asylum-seekers, including Syrian Kurds.\n\n\u201cI saw the flames and the security agents from the building came and then a few minutes after that the police and ambulance. There are Syrians here (at the asylum center), but I can\u2019t confirm (the man) was a resident,\u201d an employee told Reuters.\n\nA witness at the asylum center said that the man resembled a \u201chuge human flame\u201d, adding: \u201cI doubt he could survive that.\u201d", "description": "A Syrian Kurdish man in his 30s set himself on fire outside the United Nations refugee agency headquarters in Geneva on Wednesday and was quickly airlifted to hospital after the flames were extinguished, police said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444074726&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0V6", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
