Popular Australian YouTube star Jordan Shanks, aka Friendlyjordies, has exposed The Bachelorette for using a manipulative editing trick known as 'frankenbiting'\n\n'Does anyone else notice the really poor voice editing in these shows?' he asked.\n\n'They're cutting words from different days and jamming them together to make a sentence,' he added.\n\nOf course, this isn't the first editing fail to emerge so far this season.\n\nDid you notice it? The editing technique was seemingly used on Angie Kent and Jess Glasgow (pictured) during an episode of The Bachelorette that aired last week\n\nLast Thursday, Warwick Adams appeared to quit The Bachelorette without saying goodbye to Angie.\n\nBut on Sunday, the 36-year-old construction supervisor exposed the reality show's editing by sharing a picture of himself hugging Angie goodbye.\n\nThe photo, which was previously published by Daily Mail Australia, showed Warwick embracing the blonde while getting into a car outside the mansion.\n\nNot happy! Warwick Adams (pictured) found himself involved in another editing scandal earlier this season, when footage of him saying goodbye to Angie was not aired\n\nA cameraman could be seen filming the whole interaction, but it appears the goodbye scene did not make the final edit.\n\n'When you \"ghost\" the Bachelorette,' Warwick captioned the Instagram post.\n\nThe episode that went to air suggested that Warwick had stormed out of the house without even informing Angie of his intention to quit.", "description": "A popular Australian YouTube star has exposed\u00a0The Bachelorette for using a manipulative editing trick known as 'frankenbiting'.", "authors": ["Jo Scrimshire For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/23/19811368-0-image-a-6_1571265629261.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
