The direct link to North Korea's missile program creates further ethical hurdles for companies, insurers and municipalities that must decide whether or not to pay ransoms to criminal groups that have locked up their files.\n\nTreasury says three hacking groups are \"responsible for North Korea's malicious cyber activity on critical infrastructure.\" The groups were sanctioned by Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control.\n\nOne of the groups was responsible for the infamous WannaCry ransomware attacks of 2017, which cost companies and governments hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n\"Treasury is taking action against North Korean hacking groups that have been perpetrating cyber attacks to support illicit weapon and missile programs,\" Sigal Mandelker, Treasury under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in the release.\n\n\"We will continue to enforce existing U.S. and UN sanctions against North Korea and work with the international community to improve cybersecurity of financial networks,\" Mandelker said.", "description": "Those groups are \"responsible for North Korea's malicious cyber activity on critical infrastructure,\" the Treasury said in a news release.", "authors": ["Kate Fazzini Amanda Macias Kevin Breuninger", "Kate Fazzini", "Amanda Macias", "Kevin Breuninger"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105997539-1562002468373rts2kaw3.jpg?v=1562002537", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
