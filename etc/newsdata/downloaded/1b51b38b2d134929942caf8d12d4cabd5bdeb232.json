This was in the beginning of their fight, so I don\u2019t know maybe Urijah kind of forgot about that. And since he\u2019s got new fighters and new things, he\u2019s not really too concerned with what kind of \u2026 they basically don\u2019t fight each other. Nick Diaz guys, Nate Diaz guys don\u2019t fight Urijah Faber guys, and I\u2019m part of Nick\u2019s team.\u201d\n\nAnd because of his team\u2019s relationship with Faber, Gracie just didn\u2019t want to be in the middle of it. But after Faber came out in interviews and said he\u2019d love to fight him, Gracie changed his tune.\n\nIf Faber keeps talking and mentioning his name, then he\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to make anybody from my team feel weird,\u201d Gracie said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want anybody from their team to feel weird, so I was kind of like it\u2019s not an interesting fight for me, but if he keeps calling my name and keeps talking (expletive), and he keeps wanting the fight, I mean I\u2019m not going to not fight him if he\u2019s attacking me, you know?\n\n\u201cI did my part and said at first that I didn\u2019t want to fight him based on the fact that he has an affiliation with Nick and Nate, but to a certain extent I\u2019m still mad, and I personally don\u2019t have a relationship with him.\u201d\n\nUFC on ESPN+ 19 takes place Saturday at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Fla., where Gracie meets Cub Swanson in the co-main event. The card streams on ESPN+.\n\nTo hear more from Gracie, watch the video above.", "description": "A pact between the Diaz brothers and Urijah Faber might not mean anything anymore.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Mike Bohn", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "John Morgan"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/kron-gracie-ufc-tampa-open-workouts-1.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
