Once they have your number, the bad guys can clean out your financial accounts, confiscate your email, delete your data and take over your social media profiles.\n\nFraudsters can do all this because many companies \u2014 including banks, brokerages, email providers and social media platforms \u2014 verify your identity by texting a code to your cellphone. Intercepting those codes can give a criminal an all-access pass to your financial and digital life.\n\nThis kind of identity fraud has been around for years, but it\u2019s getting more attention after a wave of cryptocurrency thefts and attacks on high profile victims, including Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who briefly lost control of his Twitter account.\n\nThis is the fraud the experts fear most\n\nThe potential damage is so great that security expert Avivah Litan, vice president at research firm Gartner Inc., fears losing her phone number far more than having her Social Security number compromised.\n\nAlso read: This couple fought $25,000 in fraudulent credit-card charges after falling prey to identity theft \u2014 then things got worse\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather they took my social, to tell you the truth,\u201d Litan says, \u201cbecause I care about my retirement money and I know some of it\u2019s protected through phone number access.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, you can\u2019t prevent this fraud \u2014 only your carrier can. And right now, criminals are finding it\u2019s pretty easy to fool the phone companies.\n\nSometimes the scam artists bribe or blackmail carrier employees; sometimes, the employees are the criminals. Other times, the fraudsters use identifying data they\u2019ve stolen, bought on the dark web or gleaned from social media to convince carriers that they\u2019re you. They pretend they want to change carriers or say they need a new SIM card, the module that identifies a phone\u2019s owner and allows it to connect to a network. Once they persuade the carrier to transfer your number to a phone they control, they can attack your other accounts.\n\nEven getting your cellphone carrier to recognize what\u2019s happening, and help you stop it, can be a challenge, says security expert Bob Sullivan, host of the \u201cSo, Bob\u201d technology podcast. Victims report being forced to educate phone company employees about the fraud and having their numbers stolen more than once, even after protections were supposedly in place.\n\n\u201cThe real problem is when you call, are you going to get a person that you can talk to about this quickly and are they going to recognize what\u2019s happening?\u201d Sullivan asks. \u201cOr are you going to be in voice mail hell for three hours while a criminal raids all your accounts?\u201d\n\nPhone companies protest they\u2019re doing all they can, and solutions that would make this theft harder also would inconvenience people who legitimately want to switch carriers or need their numbers transferred to new SIM cards because their phones have been lost or stolen.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Your baby\u2019s identity may already have been stolen\n\nWhile you can\u2019t prevent this fraud if you have a cellphone, you may be able to reduce the chances of being victimized or at least limit the damage.\n\nChange how you\u2019re identified, if you can\n\nFirst, ask your phone company to put a personal identification number on your account. Hopefully the carrier will require that to be produced before your phone number is \u201cported out\u201d to a new carrier or assigned to a different SIM card.\n\nThen, investigate whether you can switch to more secure authentication on your sensitive accounts. Being texted a code is better than nothing, since this \u201ctwo factor\u201d authentication is harder to beat than just using a password. Better options would be to get the codes through a call to a landline or by using an authenticator app such as Authy, Google Authenticator or Duo Security on your smartphone.\n\nAssume the worst\n\nIf your phone stops working or you can\u2019t send or receive texts, don\u2019t assume it\u2019s a glitch. Call using an alternate method or visit your carrier immediately to report phone takeover fraud. Sullivan recommends knowing a few alternate ways to contact your carrier, such as Wi-Fi calling, Skype or an easily accessed backup phone.\n\nRead next: 5 ways to keep your money safe from hackers in 2019\n\nIf you do become a victim, you should:\n\nAlert your financial institutions.\n\nChange the email and password associated with all your financial and payment accounts.\n\nFreeze your credit reports.\n\nFile identity theft reports with the Federal Trade Commission and your local police department.\n\nThe important thing is to move quickly, because the bad guys won\u2019t wait.\n\n\u201cYou have a plan in place because minutes are going to matter,\u201d Sullivan says.\n\nMore from NerdWallet:", "description": "If you\u2019re not familiar with SIM swap fraud, prepare to be terrified.", "authors": ["Liz Weston"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT993_nerd_s_ZG_20191024181726.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
