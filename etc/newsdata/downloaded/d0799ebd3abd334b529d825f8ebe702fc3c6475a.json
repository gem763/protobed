Potentially four times that amount ends up on the land.\n\nNearly half of the plastic waste on the Earth right now was produced after the year 2000, mainly for packaging and in the construction and car industries.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Environment Programme, at current rates of pollution there will likely be more plastic in the sea than fish in thirty years\n\nLizzie Prior from the Marine Conservation Society told the Daily Express: 'These images from Purfleet are heartbreaking'\n\nThe WWF says more than 270 animal species have been entangled in plastic debris, which is how at least 1,000 marine turtles die each year.\n\nIt hit out at just 20 per cent of plastic being collected for recycling worldwide, while more than half is burned or sent to landfill.\n\nIts analysis reveals that carbon dioxide released by burning plastic will triple by 2030, despite plastic compounds from incineration being linked to heart disease. The charity wants single-use plastics like carrier bags and straws to be phased out by 2030.\n\nIn December 2017 Britain joined the other 193 UN countries and signed up to a resolution to help eliminate marine litter and microplastics in the sea.\n\nIt is estimated that about eight million metric tons of plastic find their way into the world's oceans every year", "description": "Plastic bottles, containers, straws and polystyrene line the banks in Purlfeet, Essex, near where the river meets the North Sea.", "authors": ["Sophie Law For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/01/20355462-0-image-a-41_1572398081396.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
