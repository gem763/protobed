Fidelity\u2019s research found that one in ten women (12 per cent) find it hard to discuss household spending with their partners and that 15 per cent struggle to talk about the debt they had accumulated.\n\nWhen asked 16 per cent said that talking about money concerns was their 'no-go' topic.\n\nOverall, money was the fourth taboo topic identified by women ahead of politics (15 per cent) and just behind sex (27 per cent), their dating history (21 per cent) and religion (16 per cent).\n\nEmma-Lou Montgomery, associate director at Fidelity International, relays how important it is to be open about our finances.\n\nShe says: \u2018While everyday money concerns can be tough or uncomfortable to discuss as a couple, it\u2019s important these are faced head on for the future benefit of both partners.\n\nEmma-Lou Montgomery, associate director of Fidelity International says that organising \"money dates\" is one way to get the conversation about finances started\n\n\u2018Whether you want to buy a property one day, have a family or travel the world in retirement, these are all life goals that need to be planned for and ultimately saved for in advance.\n\n'Discussing what you want from life early on in a relationship and then planning together how you will get there is a good start to approaching the topic of money.\u2019\n\nMum\u2019s the word on savings\n\nEven more positive financial topics were a struggle for women to talk about.\n\nFor instance, long-term savings was also an out-of-bounds topic for many with 12 per cent of women finding it difficult to discuss future investment plans with their partner.\n\nFidelity International\u2019s report \u2018The Financial Power of Women\u2019, identified that women were generally behind when it came to getting savings, like pensions in order. This is because there is still a gender gap in earnings.\n\nAccording to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data published in the report the average man working full time earns an average \u00a3718 per week, while the average woman earns \u00a3578 a week.\n\nThe gender pay gap is driven by many factors including under representation of women in the workforce as well as familial responsibilities which women, on the whole, generally still juggle the most.\n\nWomen fall behind in their pensions because they are under represented in the workplace and also lose out when they take time off to look after their children\n\nWhy women hate to talk about money\n\nFidelity\u2019s report attributed a lack of time and confidence as some of the biggest barriers to women discussing their finances and the problems relating to them.\n\nMontgomery adds that there are tactics couples can adopt to encourage more openness about money.\n\nShe says: \u2018Of course, not all couples can be expected to be completely transparent and everyone will have their personal reasons for keeping certain topics off the table.\n\n\u2018However, catching up regularly on your financial situation, or setting up \u201cmoney dates\u201d to discuss your household\u2019s day-to-day spending together can be beneficial.\n\n\u2018We know from our research that women can lack confidence when it comes to investing; seeking advice from a partner as a first step could help with getting to grips with the topic.\n\n\u2018But remember that, there are also external resources for both men and women who need help addressing financial concerns that they aren\u2019t yet comfortable discussing with their loved ones.\u2019", "description": "Most women would rather red card their partner's sexual performance and reveal their own relationship history than talk about their finances, according to a Fidelity survey.", "authors": ["Angelique Ruzicka For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
