It is not even a paid up whole life policy, so basically I will be stuck paying rather high premiums as long as I live if I keep it. . My only resort now is to find someone that can service this policy to help me\n\n1) lower the premiums either by lowering the face amount of payout, or help me figure out other options.\n\n- - Metlife sold its life insurance advisor force, and gradually phased out the role of the life insurance agent - - in fact I don't have anyone assigned to my policy at all. Repeated calls into customer service or to no avail. I am told to find a local agent on my own to service this policy. Going that route, no one is really motivated to help me - they either want to sell me some other type of policy, or not return calls.\n\nSo I hate to throw all the money away that my mother and I have paid into this policy, but quite frankly it burns me up to continue paying premiums on a product, that I can not even get advised on . .\n\nThe cash value is around $12,000.00\n\nI am not yet retired, so I am not sure cashing it in to get another policy is a smart move?What sort of tax implication will I face?\n\nJean", "description": "I have this Metlife Whole life insurance policy that my mother took out on me when I was in my early 20's - - I'm now 50.
