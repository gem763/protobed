Others pitch solutions for leaving planet Earth.\n\nMusic composer Alex Braga is playing electronic polyphonies on an upright piano.\n\nBraga stripped it of its front wood panel and wired it to A- Mint: the first ever artificial intelligence that can decode any musical improvisation style in real time, without the use of databases.\n\nA-Mint can multiply 10 fingers into 160.\n\nIt can orchestrate with different instruments and build an endless overlaying of tunes.\n\nInside the \"Re-Think\" pavilion, hydroponic farming, which needs no soil and little water, offers a solution to farming in harsh climates.\n\nA way to give astronauts their daily greens, or provide produce for a new colony of humans on another planet.\n\nProduce innovator Renato Reggiani is preparing to farm on Mars.\n\nHis food-tech startup Biopic uses photosynthesis lamps to grow produce of all kinds.\n\nHe uses a specific wavelength that can modify the genetic expression of the plant, to make them richer in antioxidants, taller or tastier.\n\nThe Maker Faire has opened its doors to cutting-edge artists for the first time this year.\n\nArtist Joaquin Fargas from Argentina has created artwork as a commentary on climate change. Together with the designer Elia Gasparolo, they created two solar-powered art installations called the Glaciator and the Rabdomante. The Glaciator is designed to compact and crystallise snow under its feet. Rabdomante collects water from dry atmosphere.\n\nThis year marks the Maker Faire's 7th edition in Rome. More than 100-thousand visitors attended the three-day event, according to organisers.", "description": "The innovative solutions also rely on artificial intelligence, which can be used to compose music or drive a game of high tech football", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/24/84/78/1000x563_cmsv2_bf888c05-0d9d-5a41-9dee-06946eee0df3-4248478.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
