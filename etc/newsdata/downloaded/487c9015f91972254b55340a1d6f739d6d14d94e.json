Chicago-based Boeing BA, +0.22% hopes to use pilots in a campaign to reassure travelers once regulators approve changes that the company is making to the plane.\n\nSouthwest LUV, +0.47% had more Max jets than any airline when the plane was grounded in March. It has canceled thousands of flights through early January as a result.\n\nThe president of the pilots\u2019 union said in an interview that the lawsuit followed failed negotiations with Boeing over compensation for income that pilots have lost due to canceled flights. Also at issue were the union\u2019s expenses to comply with a subpoena from the Justice Department, which is conducting a criminal investigation into Boeing\u2019s representations to regulators who certified the plane.\n\nThe union leader, Jon Weaks, said he believes Boeing will make the plane safe and pilots will resume flying it.\n\n\u201cWhen the plane comes back, it will be one of the most examined airplanes ever,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problems they had with MCAS are being engineered out of it.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit, however, uses harsh language in condemning Boeing for what it told airlines and pilots about the Max, which went into service in 2017. Boeing sold the plane as a more fuel-efficient but otherwise lightly modified version of the 737, which has flown since the 1960s.\n\n\u201cThose representations proved to be false,\u201d the union says in its lawsuit. \u201cThe 737 MAX now is grounded worldwide because it is unsafe, unairworthy, and contrary to Boeing\u2019s representations, distinct from the 737 family of aircraft that preceded it, which SWAPA pilots have flown for years.\u201d\n\nCrashes involving Max jets in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people. The company faces dozens of lawsuits filed by passengers\u2019 families and has settled a few for undisclosed terms. In July, it announced a $4.9 billion after-tax charge to cover compensation it expects to pay airlines in coming years to cover canceled flights.", "description": "The Southwest Airlines Pilots Association said in the lawsuit filed Monday that Boeing rushed the plane into service and misled pilots by saying it was...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR696_737max_ZG_20190919184114.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
