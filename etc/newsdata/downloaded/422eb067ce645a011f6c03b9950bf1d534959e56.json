The Stranger Things actress is the latest star to completely change her hair this fall season. She's blonde now with a lob, though she did flirt with long brown hair shortly before.\n\nTwo Miami salons shared photos of Brown's two hair transformations yesterday, though when they were actually done is unclear.\n\nIt appears Brown went and got extensions first just for kicks. Dafne Evangelista Beauty Lounge shared three Instagrams of Brown yesterday smiling with her new 'do. In the one video they shared, Brown gushed, 'I have hair for the first time in four years, so it\u2019s good.' (Brown shaved her head for her role as Eleven in Stranger Things. She has since been growing her hair out.)\n\nBut then, Brown decided to change her look again. YSV Salon shared a photo of Brown on its Instagram yesterday too, extensions out, going blonde. So Brown is no longer a brunette...for now. Stranger Things hasn't been confirmed for a fourth season yet, but should it be, she'll likely return to brown for her role as Eleven.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho else has completely changed their hair this fall? Several people: Selena Gomez debuted super long hair, Mila Kunis went out with blonde and teal hair, and Rihanna got bangs.\n\nA fifth\u2014albeit more subtle\u2014hair change? Hilary Duff, who went Lizzie McGuire blonde. She'll be shooting a reboot of the series, which will feature her Disney Channel sitcom character as a 30-year-old, for Disney's new streaming service, Disney+.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Eleven with the wig, only make it permanent", "authors": ["Alyssa Bailey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4IKId.iMVF4bjHcKttACAg--~B/aD03MjM7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_865/e074eaee7a5721db3f7c97833517ab03", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
