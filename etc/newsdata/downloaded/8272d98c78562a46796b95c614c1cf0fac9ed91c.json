I feel so bad about what I saw today, I can't imagine what those poor living creatures have endured....in the name of progress and technology?\"\n\nAccording to CFI, tests carried out at the laboratory involve poisoning animals to see how much of a chemical or drug it takes to cause serious harm, in an attempt to measure what a \u2018safe\u2019 dose for humans might be.\n\n(Image: Cruelty Free International)\n\nThey claim the animals are injected with or made to eat or inhale increasing amounts of a substance to measure the toxic effects.\n\nThe horrific effects include vomiting, internal bleeding, respiratory distress, fever, weight loss, lethargy, skin problems, organ failure and even death.\n\nCFI claim animals are not given pain relief or anaesthetics.\n\nThe undercover worker said staff are not trained animal carers and were often violent towards the animals.\n\nThey said they witnessed beagles bleeding after the experiments in which pipes forced were down their throat as they were given capsules.\n\n(Image: Cruelty Free International)\n\n(Image: Cruelty Free International)\n\nMichelle Thew, CFI chief executive, is calling for the laws to be changed.\n\nHe said: \"Our investigation has uncovered appalling animal suffering, inadequate care, poor practices and breaches of European and German law.\n\n\"We are calling for LPT to be closed.\n\n\"We are also calling for a comprehensive review into the use of animals in regulatory toxicity testing in Europe, including the UK.\n\n\"Every investigation, without fail, shows a similar tale of misery and disregard of the law.\"\n\nAn online petition has been launched by activist Carolin Iding that calls for LPT to be shut down.\n\n(Image: Cruelty Free International)\n\nIt says: \"The recent research by the SOKO Animal Welfare to LPT shows again in horrible pictures and video recordings that in my city animals are tortured and maltreated.\n\nWhen I think about how animals are suffering behind the walls of the LPT right now and experiencing hell on earth right now, everything in me contracts.\n\n\"No living thing deserves to be treated like that and die like that!\"", "description": "Infuriated animal rights protesters are demanding the Laboratory of Pharmacology and Toxicology near Hamburg be shut down", "authors": ["Milo Boyd", "Image", "Cruelty Free International", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20584470.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_SOCIAL-Monkeys-scream-out-in-pain-in-secret-footage-recorded-at-German-lab.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
