We had much different expectations for the beginning of the season.\u201d\n\nGruden, 52, is the younger brother of Oakland Raiders coach Jon Gruden. He was dismissed in a Monday meeting with team owner Dan Snyder and president Bruce Allen.\n\nGruden finished with a record of 35-49 and one drawn and only one playoff appearance, a first-round loss to Green Bay in the 2015 postseason.\n\nThe Redskins, looking at a third consecutive losing season after back-to-back 7-9 campaigns, named Bill Callahan, the assistant head coach and offensive line coach as interim head coach.\n\nCallahan has coached for more than two decades in the NFL, starting as offensive line coach for the 1995 Philadelphia Eagles. He served as an offensive coordinator for the Oakland Raiders from 1998 to 2001 before taking over as head coach for two seasons when Jon Gruden left to coach Tampa Bay. Callahan was offensive coordinator of the Dallas Cowboys from 2012 to early 2015 until he was hired away to join Jay Gruden at the Redskins.\n\nCallahan\u2019s first game as interim head coach will be next Sunday at winless Miami.\n\nUnder Gruden, the Redskins, who have had only five winning seasons this millenium, crept above .500 in 2015 and 2016, when Sean McVay, now coach of the Los Angeles Rams, served as Washington\u2019s offensive coordinator.\n\nThis season, the Redskins began with Case Keenum as starting quarterback. Rookie Dwayne Haskins has struggled in limited action, throwing three interceptions in a relief role in a fourth-game loss to the New York Giants.\n\nOn Sunday, Gruden started Colt McCoy against New England but the attack continued to sputter.\n\nGruden also raised questions by benching veteran running back Adrian Peterson for the season opener.\n\nWashington\u2019s defensive unit is without tackle Trent Williams, the NFL\u2019s only remaining contract holdout.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Jay Gruden was fired Monday as coach of the NFL\u2019s Washington Redskins, ending his reign early in his sixth season after an", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/c9934f_jay-gruden-was-fired-on-monday-as-coach-nfl-washington-redskins-team-lost-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
