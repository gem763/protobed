Here is how the results came in:\n\nNET PROFIT: Total's net profit in the third quarter fell to $2.80 billion from $3.96 billion in the year-earlier period. Adjusted net income came in at $3.02 billion, ahead of a FactSet-compiled consensus that had forecast it at $2.79 billion.\n\nPRODUCTION: Total's third-quarter production hit a record high, helping offset the negative impact of lower energy prices. Hydrocarbon production jumped 8% to 3.04 million barrels of oil equivalent a day compared with 2.80 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in the year-earlier period. Production was boosted by a number of projects, including the Yamal liquefied natural gas project in Russia and Ichthys in Australia. The company said it expects its 2019 production to grow by 9%.\n\nWHAT WE WATCHED:\n\n- INTEGRATED GAS, RENEWABLES AND POWER: Total reported a strong performance in its integrated gas, renewables and power business segment, where production rose 45% to 539,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day compared with 371,000 daily barrels of oil equivalent the same period a year earlier.\n\n- DIVIDEND: The company declared an interim dividend of EUR0.68 a share for, a 6% increase compared to the previous year.\n\nWrite to Giulia Petroni at giulia.petroni@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 30, 2019 10:48 ET (14:48 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
