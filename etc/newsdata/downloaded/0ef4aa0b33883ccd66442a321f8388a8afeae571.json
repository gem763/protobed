The technology behind it is similar to Apple\u2019s Face ID, and aside from just letting you into your phone, Google believes face unlock is secure enough to serve as an authentication method across Android. (There\u2019s no more fingerprint sensor on the Pixel 4, remember.) And it\u2019s very fast. But BBC News reporter Chris Fox has noticed an alarming privacy concern with Google\u2019s face unlock: it works even if your eyes are fully closed.\n\nA support page about face unlock directly confirms as much. \u201cYour phone can also be unlocked by someone else if it\u2019s held up to your face, even if your eyes are closed,\u201d the page reads. \u201cKeep your phone in a safe place, like your front pocket or handbag.\u201d You\u2019ll want to follow that advice at night since face unlock would also work if you\u2019re sound asleep.\n\nThis is a risk factor that iPhones don\u2019t share. By default, Apple\u2019s Face ID requires attention \u2014 meaning your eyes need to be open and actively looking at the iPhone or iPad Pro screen \u2014 to successfully unlock a device. This setting, which Apple says is an added security measure, can be disabled in settings if a customer so chooses. But Apple clearly states that \u201crequiring attention makes Face ID more secure.\u201d\n\nFor the Pixel 4, there\u2019s no such option \u2014 not yet, at least. There\u2019s evidence that Google is working on it. Among the countless Pixel 4 leaks, you might\u2019ve missed a photo of this screen with an option to \u201crequire eyes to be open\u201d for face unlock to work.\n\nHowever, according to Fox, this toggle is not present on the Pixel 4\u2019s software that will ship to consumers next week. When reached by The Verge, Google didn\u2019t say one way or the other whether this added layer of security is definitely coming. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything specific to announce regarding future features or timing, but like most of our products, this feature is designed to get better over time with future software updates,\u201d a spokesperson said by email.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re wondering why this matters. Well, aside from snooping friends or partners, the Pixel 4\u2019s face unlock (in its current state) could make it easier for authorities to unlock a seized device without the owner\u2019s permission. If all it takes is pointing the phone at your face, that\u2019s not great.\n\nBut there is one way Pixel 4 buyers can prevent that possibility until Google rolls out a fix.\n\nGoogle is reminding customers about Android\u2019s lockdown function, which completely disables biometric authentication and will only unlock a phone if and when the PIN is entered. Lockdown can now be added directly to the power menu options on Pixel phones for fast access if you find yourself in a situation where you urgently need to thwart prying eyes \u2014 like so:\n\niOS has a similarly quick trick: you can just hold down the power button and one of the volume buttons until you see the power down menu (or feel a vibration if you\u2019re not looking at the phone), after which Face ID is temporarily disabled until the PIN is entered.\n\nHere\u2019s how to add a shortcut for lockdown to your power options in Android 10, which is what the Pixel 4 ships with:\n\nOpen settings\n\nChoose Display\n\nExpand the \u201cAdvanced\u201d section at the bottom\n\nTap on \u201cLock screen display\u201d\n\nEnable \u201cShow lockdown option\u201d\n\nAside from disabling face unlock, lockdown also turns off smart lock (so your trusted Bluetooth devices won\u2019t unlock the phone if they\u2019re still on you) and hides notifications from the lock screen.", "description": "The new face unlock feature on Google\u2019s Pixel 4 works even if the phone owner\u2019s eyes are closed.
