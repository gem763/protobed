He also mentioned \u201cyounger players\u201d as part of his back-up options given Laporte is likely to be out for six months.\n\nEven if Guardiola is not ready to axe his current partnership, with the Champions League and League Cup coming into the fixture list this month, it would be surprising if the City boss did not try some other options.\n\nGuardiola has not got a great track record at City of throwing in kids, but it might not be long until he gives a start to 18-year-old Spanish centre-half Eric Garcia.\n\nA product of Barcelona\u2019s La Masia academy, Garcia plays with a maturity beyond his age and, while he has had only one League Cup start, last December against Leicester City, he might soon find himself a little busier.\n\nNORWICH A REFRESHING CHANGE\n\nPromoted Norwich\u2019s 4-1 loss at Liverpool on the opening day prompted many pundits to suggest there was a naivety to maintaining their attacking style in the top flight.\n\nOf course, after their stunning win over City, Canaries coach Daniel Farke is basking in praise from the same commentators.\n\nThere will be plenty more ups and downs this season but it is refreshing to see a promoted side stick to their guns and play with the kind of ambition needed to produce a shock win.\n\nABRAHAM AN ENGLAND OPTION?\n\nWith seven goals in his last three games, Chelsea forward Tammy Abraham has answered the doubters who wondered if, after scoring 26 goals for Aston Villa in the Championship (second-tier) last season, he could deliver in the top flight.\n\nAbraham has two England caps and appears to fit the profile of young talent that national team boss Gareth Southgate looks for. After featuring in the 2017 friendlies against Germany and Brazil, few would be surprised if he returns to the camp soon.\n\nBut Abraham surprised many when, after his impressive hat-trick at Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday, he was rather vague when asked if he still could choose to play for Nigeria for whom he qualifies through his father.\n\n\u201cI have heard the talk... When the time comes, the time comes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe never know. You can never say never... whatever comes first really.\u201d\n\nMcTOMINAY MATURING\n\nHe might want to bring back the dashing, attacking style of the past, but Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was happy enough with a slightly dull 1-0 home win against Leicester City.\n\nHe was particularly pleased with the performance of Scott McTominay, who delivered one of his best displays in the centre of the park, marrying aggression and work-rate with increasing maturity.\n\n\u201cHe goes into tackles, challenges and fights. If there\u2019s a team trying to intimidate us, he\u2019s the first one there - he\u2019s a leader. I wouldn\u2019t want to go into a 50-50 with him,\u201d said the United boss.\n\nFAMILIAR PROBLEM FOR GUNNERS\n\nArsenal gave up a two-goal lead at Watford in a 2-2 draw at Vicarage Road as their opponents had 31 shots.\n\nThat is the most the Gunners have allowed since such statistics were first collected in 2003 and proof that Unai Emery has yet to fix his stuttering side\u2019s biggest weakness.", "description": "The following are five talking points from the weekend's Premier League action:", "authors": ["Simon Evans", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430436885&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0SS", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
