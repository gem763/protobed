Ted Cruz during confirmation hearing, Sept. 6, 2018.)\n\n\u201cYes, I was asked to get involved and it was a case of importance for people (Elian\u2019s humble Miami relatives) who needed help.\u201d (Judge Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearing, Sept. 6, 2018.)\n\nMany forget how widespread across the political spectrum\u2014thanks to the non-stop Fake News Media/Clinton parroting of Castroite propaganda--was the public pressure to partner (not with those \u201cdeplorable\u201d anti-communist Cuban-Americans, heaven forbid!) --but with Fidel Castro and return Elian to his Stalinist clutches.\n\n\u201cEverywhere in America outside the Greater Miami area, the reaction to Janet Reno's dawn raid was not `Oh, my God, how could she do that?' but `What took her so long?\u201d wrote Mark Steyn (no less!) expressing his own sentiments. \u201cEveryone was sick of Elian's `Miami family.\u201d\n\nSadly, most Americans swallowed Castro\u2019s bait, as did the otherwise brilliant Steyn. Polls at the time showed most Americans siding with Fidel Castro on the issue.\n\nBut Brett Kavanaugh wasn\u2019t having any of it. He was not swayed. His backbone remained straight and stiff. His fortitude prevailed. Unlike \u201csavants\u201d like Mark Steyn and a majority of Americans, Brett Kavanaugh saw right through the Castroite/ Fake News Media/ Democrat scam. Better still, he was so outraged by its vileness that he volunteered to work with and for those (deplorable-before-the-term-was-cool) Cuban-Americans pro bono!\n\nGranted, the scam that took in Mark Steyn and so many others was a skillful and elaborate one, typical of the Castro regime\u2019s propaganda schemes:\n\nLest we forget, on Dec. 1st 1999, shortly after Elian\u2019s rescue at sea, the matter seemed settled. The INS asserted that Miami-based uncle Lazaro was indeed Elian\u2019s legal custodian and Florida\u2019s family court indeed the place to arbitrate further issues. In addition, Elian\u2019s father Juan Miguel thanked his Miami relatives for rescuing Elian and vowed to soon follow him.\n\nThen on Dec. 5th, 1999, Fidel Castro stepped onto the stage, issued a sharp whistle and his Fake News Media lapdogs rushed around him, their eyes wide, their tongues out and their tails wagging frantically.\n\n\u201cMuch more valuable than rural recruits for our Cuban guerrilla force were American media recruits to export our propaganda.\u201d -Ernesto \u201cChe\u201d Guevara 1959)\n\nAnd those invaluable American \u201creporters\u201d (especially from The New York Times) were still as tail-waggingly eager for Castro/Che commands in April 2000 as they\u2019d been in 1957--and as they remain today for his successors.\n\nThe genuine issue during the Elian Gonzalez circus had nothing to do with \u201cparental rights,\u201d as the Castro/Fake News Media/ Democrat propaganda campaign claimed (and many half-wits swallowed.) Instead it was: should a mass-murdering, terror-sponsoring foreign dictator trample on the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights with the compliance of a U.S. President.\n\nWell, a Clinton was in the White House. So naturally, despite the best efforts of people like Brett Kavanaugh, the communist dictator whose lifelong dream was to nuke the U.S., whose own \u201ccourts\u201d channeled Stalin\u2019s during the Great Terror, and whose sidekick Che Guevara boasted that \u201cjudicial procedures are an archaic bourgeois detail\u201d \u2013the whims of this mass-murdering international terrorist and criminal easily prevailed over the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAfter all, even lifelong liberal Democrats like Alan Dershowitz and Harvard\u2018s Lawrence Tribe gagged at the unconstitutionality of Elian\u2019s kidnapping by the INS (on Fidel Castro\u2019s orders as obeyed by Bill Clinton and transmitted to Eric Holder, Janet Reno and ultimately the INS.)\n\n\u201cThey (the Clinton administration) acted lawlessly. They should have gotten a court order. They didn't go for a court order because they knew they couldn't get one. It's a dangerous day for all Americans. (Alan Dershowitz, April 25, 2000.)\n\nIn fact, this key item was frantically hushed by the Fake News Media/Democrat cabal, but: Elian\u2019s father was initially delighted that his motherless son was in the U.S. and in the loving arms of his uncles and cousins.\n\nMauricio Vicent, a reporter for Madrid newspaper El Pais, wrote that a week after Elian\u2019s rescue at sea, he\u2019d visited Elian\u2019s hometown of Cardenas in Cuba and talked with Elian\u2019s father, Juan Miguel, along with other family members and friends. All confirmed that Juan Miguel had always longed for his son Elian to flee to the United States. Shortly after Elian\u2019s rescue, his father had even applied for a U.S. visa!\n\nThen Fidel Castro stepped into the picture. The mass-murderer stuck his fingers in his mouth, issued a sharp whistle of summons and instantly the Media/Democrat complex (including the Clinton team) was all around him, tails wagging and tongues hanging, eager to start taking their usual dictation regarding his every whim and wish\u2026.but we\u2019ve exposed the details of that legal and moral atrocity often hereabouts.\n\n\u201cI always said I would turn over Elian to his father,\u201d repeatedly explained Elian\u2019s Miami uncle Lazaro, \u201cif Juan Miguel would come here freely and claim him. But I knew he could never do that. I knew it wasn\u2019t Juan Miguel requesting Elian--it was Fidel.\"\n\nSomehow Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s instincts told him the same thing.", "description": "\u201cYup, I gotta confess, that now-famous picture of a U.S. .09/21/2019 3:12:33AM EST.", "authors": ["Humberto Fontova", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/184/fee76cbd-1122-41b5-a349-87c5a6ec3b13.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
