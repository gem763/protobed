We need a Final Say to stop our country becoming permanently divided", "language": "en", "text": "Vince Cable is absolutely right when he draws attention to the risk that the country could stay divided over Brexit indefinitely.\n\nIt seems to me that the dangers posed by a permanently divided society now outweigh the whole of both sides of the Brexit argument in terms of the potential future damage to the social and cultural fabric of our society.\n\nLike many, I follow this closely but I have seen nothing from politicians about how we will be unified afterwards and, unless we are, we will not move forward.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe only conceivable solution is a Final Say referendum. Accepting the outcome would be difficult for both sides but all would know that the result represented the views of an informed electorate \u2013 perhaps an electorate more informed than any other, ever.\n\nTo me, Brexit is a damaging neoliberal project which has tricked large parts of the nation. I reject it vehemently but I would accept the outcome of a second referendum and find a way to move on if Leave won again.\n\nRegardless of any outcome, the next thing I want is major strengthening of controls over public dishonesty and deception. This could start with banning media briefings by unaccountable civil servants in Downing Street who play games with people\u2019s lives.\n\nHow low must we sink?\n\nDavid Lowndes\n\nHampshire\n\nWhat lies in store for Britain?\n\nI\u2019ve just read Samah Hadid\u2019s piece about Lebanon, the unrest, the shortages, the unemployment. Even longstanding sectarian divisions have yielded to a common opposition to the self-serving elements of the political class.\n\nIf Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit goes ahead, with or without his deal, that could be the UK in not many years\u2019 time. But why would he care?\n\nSusan Alexander\n\nSouth Gloucestershire\n\nHeated argument\n\nYour item on portable heaters confuses efficiency with effectiveness of heat. All electric heating is 100 per cent efficient as all the heat is contained in the room and there is no loss (once the electricity is inside your house that is). Fan heaters and oil-filled radiators may distribute the heat more effectively but are no more efficient than any other electric heater.\n\nPeople are already poorly informed about heating and energy and many struggle to get to the reality of it. Perpetuating confusion with colloquial use that distorts the meaning of important defining words only adds to the confusion.\n\nAshley Herbert\n\nWest Yorkshire\n\nApathetic fallacy\n\nJohn Rentoul writes: \u201cI don\u2019t know how much he [Boris Johnson] understood about the mood of exhaustion among Labour MPs, but he did grasp the effectiveness of the slogan, \u2018Get Brexit Done\u2019.\u201d\n\nThis slogan, along with other Johnson phrases such as \u201cthe country is tired\u201d and \u201cjust get it over the line\u201d are very dangerous, suggesting that we are now worn down to a state of such apathy that we will accept whatever the government can be bothered to offer us.\n\nAre we really content to be persuaded by cleverly designed advertising jingles rather than by clearly and honestly presented policy? After all, I can indeed believe that it\u2019s not butter.\n\nBeryl Wall\n\nLondon\n\nMeet back here? 2044?\n\nYour article about 17 minutes of Brexit sense is spot on. Right down to the fact that many of those debating had indeed been around for Maastricht.\n\nIt is simply unbelievable that they still at it.\n\nBut what\u2019s worse is that we the public, whatever persuasion we are from, are continuing to pay for them to have turned parliament into the Brexit chamber. This is an all-consuming Tory argument with itself that leaves no room to govern this country at all.\n\n\u201cGetting brexit done\u201d really means only opening up the next stage of the process. That is the stage that is the really difficult one as it is all about the deal. Since we can\u2019t agree on how we leave after three years and counting... good luck with that.\n\nIf this keeps up I could be writing on similar terms in 25 years\u2019 time!\n\nJohn Sinclair\n\nEast Riding of Yorkshire\n\nIf only there was some way to test public opinion...\n\nThe Brexiteers keep referring to the will of the people.\n\nWe can now find out the exact will of the people by having a referendum where the electorate vote for which one of the four possibilities available they regard as the best for the UK to pursue: no deal; Johnson\u2019s deal; May\u2019s deal; or Remain.\n\nWhat could be fairer than that?\n\nTony Baker\n\nNorth Yorkshire", "description": "Vince Cable is absolutely right when he draws attention to the risk that the country could stay divided over Brexit indefinitely.
