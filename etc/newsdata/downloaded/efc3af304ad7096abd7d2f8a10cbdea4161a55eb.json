In the past few years, dozens and dozens of writers have emerged who focus almost solely upon motherhood and the political issues that are integral to it. This has made writing about parenting not less interesting but more so, because we\u2019re not just voices in a vacuum: We\u2019re part of a conversation. And parents need conversations more than ever because parenting, in the 21st century, can often be isolating.\n\nWhich is why we\u2019ve made a Facebook page dedicated to readers of the Cut who are interested in parenting. Here, you\u2019ll find New York Magazine\u2019s parenting coverage as well as other peoples\u2019 writing. We hope to use this page to start conversations with all of the parents out there who are reading and writing every single day.\n\nThere are more than a few studies, often written about with a hint of eye-roll, about mothers and how much they post on Facebook. It\u2019s a particularly fertile space for writing and sharing about motherhood specifically because it\u2019s geared toward communities and dialogue. While it\u2019s not always perfect, it\u2019s probably the best place on the web for complex, nuanced conversations about such a complicated topic. Some of the most heated \u2014 but also some of the most intelligent \u2014 responses to things I have written came not in the comments on the article, or on Twitter, but on Facebook: This is where most of the moms are.\n\nAt first, when you become a mother, you feel like a completely different person. But quickly, many of us realize that motherhood doesn\u2019t change who we are. It adds to who we are. Becoming a parent means becoming more powerful than one could have ever imagined, and becoming more in tune with our own mortality, humanity, and day-to-day emotions. Being a parent is hard, it\u2019s rewarding, it\u2019s really funny. It\u2019s an identity worth considering and writing about, not just for those of us who are writers, and not in a vacuum. I\u2019ve always been a writer, but what I\u2019ve realized since becoming a mother is that parenthood makes storytellers of us all.\n\nThe internet can be a shitty place \u2014 for everyone, not just parents. But it\u2019s also incredibly useful and beautiful sometimes, too. Hopefully, this Facebook page will become a place where we can talk about the things that matter to us, from the minute to the epic, and know that our voices are being heard. I\u2019ll be reading.\n\nJoin us right here to get started.", "description": "<span class=message_body>A new home for real talk.</span>", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2016/05/11/womens-work-alice-proujansky/Womens-Work-Petrushka-1.w1200.h630.jpg"}
