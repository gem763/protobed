I ask for forgiveness for Germany\u2019s historical guilt and I recognise our enduring responsibility,\u201d Frank-Walter Steinmeier said at a ceremony in Pi\u0142sudski Square in Warsaw.\n\nSteinmeier and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, joined a number of heads of state at the ceremony. Other events were held in Wielu\u0144, which was heavily bombarded by the German air force on the first day of the war; and Westerplatte, where the first shots of the war were fired when a German battleship opened fire on a Polish garrison in the early hours of 1 September.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to imagine that cataclysm of history today, the armed conflict which brought the most disastrous consequences in the history of mankind. We have to remember, and therefore we are gathered here today,\u201d the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, said at the Warsaw ceremony.\n\nPoland\u2019s nationalist government had hoped that the US president, Donald Trump, would be the guest of honour, but he cancelled at the last minute and sent his vice-president, Mike Pence, in his place.\n\nDespite the atmosphere of reconciliation, different politicians drew very different conclusions about the lessons of the war.\n\nThere was a note of anger in Duda\u2019s speech, as he said Europe should have stood up to the Nazis earlier. \u201cPerhaps the second world war would not have broken out in the first place, if the states in the west had put up a decisive resistance against \u2026 the imperial ambitions of Hitler,\u201d he said.\n\nBy way of comparison, Duda also criticised western leaders who propose rapprochement with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, after Moscow\u2019s actions in Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014. \u201cTurning a blind eye is not the recipe for preserving peace. It is a simple way to give consent to further attacks,\u201d he said.\n\nPutin was present at a similar commemoration 10 years ago, but was not invited this year because of the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and Russia\u2019s new revisionist historical policy, which downplays the Nazi-Soviet pact agreed a week before Germany attacked Poland.\n\nThe Soviet Union, in accordance with a secret protocol of the pact, invaded Poland from the east on 17 September. Putin called the pact a mistake a decade ago, but Russia\u2019s foreign ministry has embarked on a campaign in recent weeks to show it as necessary and even a diplomatic triumph.\n\nPence used his speech to talk as much about Soviet atrocities as Nazi crimes, paying tribute to Polish bravery and quoting the Russian writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn. The main problem of the 20th century was that men had forgotten God, he said.\n\nThe European commission vice-president, Frans Timmermans, attended the ceremony in Westerplatte and had a different message. He said the best way to honour the memory of the war dead was by \u201cworking for tolerance, working for mutual respect, working to remove the feeding ground of those who propose intolerance\u201d. Timmermans has been a vocal critic of the current Polish government.\n\nThe Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, raised another thorny issue, using his speech at Westerplatte to demand Germany pay reparations for the devastation of Poland during the war.\n\n\u201cWe have to talk about, remember and demand the truth regarding those losses. We have to demand compensation,\u201d he said. German officials have insisted that the matter is closed and they will not pay reparations.", "description": "Frank-Walter Steinmeier made speech at Warsaw event to mark 80 years since start of war", "authors": ["Shaun Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c335b880aaf5a03c76559712a58b64c1050afa1/0_32_2932_1759/master/2932.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=251921f91eb91144bff5381034b81236"}
