The use of social and scientific innovation in economic growth and technology, and a focus on \"made in China\", apart from reforms at all levels, including industry, education, health and other important areas, are reasons behind the country's progress and prosperity.\n\nWhile we reflect on the glorious history of China, the contribution made by the Communist Party of China in the development process needs to be emphasized. Founded in 1921, the CPC has contributed to China's growth process through dynamic leadership and ideology. One of the world's largest parties, with more than 90 million members, the CPC marks its 98th year in 2019.\n\nSocialism with Chinese characteristics, including multiparty cooperation and political consultations, has laid a solid foundation for the country's overall growth.\n\nThere are no political or other bottlenecks to progress, thanks to one-party rule. The essence of the CPC is \"serving the people\", and this has remained the driving principle behind its reform policies and development efforts. The current CPC leadership is determined to promote national, regional and global peace and prosperity.\n\nThe growth path has widened since 2012 under the leadership of President Xi Jinping. In 2013, Xi proposed the One Belt and One Road, later renamed the Belt and Road Initiative, a dream to connect the world.\n\nThe BRI has now turned into China's global strategy with far-reaching implications. President Xi made \"dare to dream, work assiduously to fulfill the dreams and contribute to the revitalization of the nation\" the new Chinese motto. The idea was to call upon the nation to work passionately toward the development of China as well as for global stability and development.\n\nPakistan and China are celebrating 2019 as the Pakistan-China Year of Friendship/Sister Cities. Their relations reached a new level with the announcement of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a part of the BRI. The corridor has entered its second phase of development, which includes the establishment of special economic zones.\n\nPakistan also has made its own contribution to enhancing China's larger connectivity dream through its unwavering support at both public and policy levels.\n\nWith the success of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, the BRI dream is becoming reality. The economic corridor has provided a massive investment opportunity for China while providing Pakistan with immense opportunities.\n\nThe world may not be fully aware of China's peaceful development ambitions in the region and beyond. As Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, a US poet, had said, \"The heights by great men reached and kept were not attained by sudden flight, but they, while their companions slept, were toiling upward in the night.\" And China will continue to rise.\n\nThe People's Republic of China, which celebrated its 70th anniversary this month, has several achievements to its credit, including being a leader in GDP growth and production of steel, cement, aluminum, cars and agricultural goods, as well as poverty alleviation, international tourism spending, smartphone manufacturing and consumption, and number of billionaires.\n\nChina has set an example for the world and other developing countries like Pakistan that, through hard work, dedication, honesty and exemplary leadership, it is possible to achieve development and prosperity.\n\nThe author is director of the Institute of Peace and Diplomatic Studies and secretary-general of the Pakistan Shanghai Cooperation Organization Friendship Forum.
