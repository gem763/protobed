Trump also announced the US would recognize Jerusalem as Israel's official capital.\n\nIsrael had captured east Jerusalem from Jordan during the 1967 Six-Day War, and in 1980, the Knesset \u2014 Israel's unicameral parliament \u2014 passed a law declaring Jerusalem as the united capital of Israel.\n\nThe annexation of Jerusalem is not internationally recognized, and Palestinians see east Jerusalem as a capital of their future state \u2014 should a two state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict come to fruition.\n\nDeadly protests in the Gaza strip leading up to and during the opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem claimed the lives of 58 Palestinians and injured more than 2,700, CNN reported.\n\nThe MEU never mobilized its forces to evacuate personnel during the embassy move, but it did practice such an operation a month prior in Jordan.\n\nOn April 25, 2018, as part of the annual Eager Lion exercise in Jordan, the 26th MEU carried out a \"full mission profile\" of a noncombatant evacuation operation, according to the chronology.\n\nDuring the exercise, Marine inserted security augments and evacuated 36 Department of State and military personnel to the Iwo Jima, the chronology detailed. The 36 evacuated personnel received a tour of the ship before departing.\n\nThe 26th MEU also participated in the biennial exercise held in Israel known as Juniper Cobra in March 2018, several months before the embassy move to Jerusalem.\n\nMarine Corps Times reached out to the Marine Corps, US Central Command and US European Command regarding the 26th MEU's response to the Jerusalem embassy move and did not receive a response.", "description": "The USS Iwo Jima and embarked members of the 26th Marine Expeditionary spent May 2018 in the Red Sea to provide quick reaction forces if needed.", "authors": ["Shawn Snow", "Marine Corps Times"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7bf05c2e22af176a6d50d5-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
