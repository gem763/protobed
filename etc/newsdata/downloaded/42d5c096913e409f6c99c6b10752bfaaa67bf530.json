They\u2019ll sing songs. They\u2019ll dance around. They\u2019ll fall out. They'll go back, and it\u2019ll be over with. So when you ask me about the things people do for you to show up, they\u2019ll continually do it as long as you show up.\u201d\n\nTexas Police Officer Fatally Shoots Black Woman Inside Her Own Home During Welfare Check\n\nLee Merritt, the attorney representing some relatives, said on Twitter Friday night that the Saturday memorial service would still happen, but it was ultimately delayed until later in the week.\n\n\u201cAtatiana\u2019s family is mourning. They\u2019re looking forward to getting through this really difficult process of grieving and memorializing their sister,\u201d Merritt told KDFW. \u201cThis is a bit of a distraction. It\u2019s unfortunate, but they are trying to stay focused and stay together during this time of bereavement.\u201d\n\nAtatiana\u2019s aunt claims that Marquis Jefferson is not Atatiana\u2019s legal or biological father, the Dallas Morning News reported. Both sides are due in court Monday morning for a hearing.\n\nAtatiana Jefferson, 28, was gunned down in her Fort Worth home on Oct. 12 after a neighbor called police to check on an open door in the dead of night.\n\nHer 8-year-old nephew told authorities she heard someone outside, got a gun out of her purse and pointed it at the window, fearing an intruder, according to court documents.\n\nBodycam footage shows Officer Aaron Dean shouting at her to put her hands up before opening fire within seconds; it\u2019s not clear if he saw the weapon.\n\nTexas Cop Who Fatally Shot Black Woman Charged With Murder\n\nDean resigned from the police force the next day and has since been charged with murder.\n\n\u201cI get it. We are trying to do better... anyone who had looked at that video saw it was wrong,\u201d Fort Worth Police Chief Ed Kraus told reporters earlier in the week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
