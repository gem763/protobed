Charity Commission records show it spent \u00a3135,982 in 2015.\n\nMs Miller also began the True and Fair Campaign in 2012, which campaigns against mis-selling and hidden fund charges in the City of London's fund management industry.\n\nAccording to an interview with the Financial Times in April, this has led some in the industry to label her the \"black widow spider\".\n\nSpeaking about a time she asked three men at an industry party why they were staring at her, she told the paper: \"One of them replied that I was a disgrace and that my lobbying efforts would bring down the entire City.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Speaking before the High Court ruling, Ms Miller said she had a strong case\n\nMs Miller launched her first Brexit legal case with London-based Spanish hairdresser Deir Tozetti Dos Santos and the People's Challenge group, set up by Grahame Pigney - a UK citizen who lives in France.\n\nBacked by a crowd-funding campaign, they argued the government could not invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - starting the formal process of the UK leaving the EU - without seeking approval from Parliament.\n\nThree London law firms - Mishcon de Reya, Edwin Coe and Bindmans - agreed to take up the case.\n\nMs Miller argued that only Parliament could make a decision leading to the loss of her \"rights\" under EU law.\n\nBut she has stressed throughout that the challenge was not an attempt to overturn the referendum decision, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We are all leavers now.\"\n\n'Verging on dictatorship'\n\nOn 3 November 2016, three judges ruled Parliament must vote on when the process can begin. The case went to the Supreme Court the following December but the 11 judges rejected the government's appeal by a majority of eight to three.\n\nSpeaking after the High Court verdict, Ms Miller told the BBC the case was about scrutinising the details of Brexit, such as \"how we leave, how they're going to negotiate, the directions of travel the government will take\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Gina Miller is considering telling the police about the vitriol she's received.\n\nMs Miller added that the challenge was about more than Brexit.\n\n\"It is about any government, any prime minister, in the future being able to take away people's rights without consulting Parliament,\" she said.\n\n\"We cannot have a democracy like that. That isn't a democracy, that is verging on dictatorship.\"\n\nParliament 'silenced'\n\nEven before Boris Johnson announced in August 2019 that he would suspend Parliament for five weeks, Ms Miller had warned she was prepared to go back to court to \"defend Parliamentary sovereignty\".\n\nHer case challenging the legality of the suspension was heard at the High Court in September. Lord Pannick, her lawyer, argued Parliament would be \"silenced\" for an \"exceptional\" length of time in the critical period before the 31 October Brexit deadline.\n\nMs Miller was backed by several other parties, including former prime minister Sir John Major.\n\nBut lawyers for Mr Johnson said prorogation - the power to suspend Parliament - was a political, not a legal, matter.\n\nThe High Court rejected her case, but said she could immediately appeal to the Supreme Court because of the important points of law at stake.\n\nIn another legal challenge, judges in Scotland took the opposite view and ruled the suspension was unlawful.\n\nThe UK government has appealed to the Supreme Court against this, and the two cases are being heard together.\n\n'Biggest fan'\n\nShe has described herself as neither a leave nor a remain campaigner.\n\nAsked whether she was \"a remainer to your boots\", she told BBC's Andrew Marr Show she had campaigned for \"remain, reform and review\" during the referendum.\n\nBut she said the case was now not about the referendum result, but \"how we leave the EU\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Ms Miller clashed with Nigel Farage on the Andrew Marr Show\n\nShe told the then-UKIP leader Nigel Farage that he should be her \"biggest fan\" following the controversial court case.\n\n\"This is about creating legal certainty and actually, everyone in the country should be my biggest fan because I've used my own money and a few of us we have used our own money to create legal certainty for Mrs May to move ahead,\" she told the programme.\n\nRape threats\n\nSome newspapers have focused on Ms Miller's private life. However, she said \"everyone has a past\" and it was \"totally irrelevant\" to the importance of the case.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Gina Miller arrived at the Supreme Court in 2017 flanked by security guards, having received death threats\n\nShe has also spoken about the abuse she suffered as a result of her legal battle.\n\n\"I was aware there would be nastiness because anything to do with the word Brexit, people lose their minds and it's all about heart. Actually it is about your head and your heart.\"\n\nShe told BBC Radio 5 live she plans to report online trolls to police after receiving rape and beheading threats.\n\nIn December, a 55-year-old man from Swindon was arrested over alleged threats against Ms Miller. He was later released and, after consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service, no further action was taken, the Metropolitan Police said.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Gina Miller told the BBC's Clive Coleman she had employed security to protect herself\n\nMs Miller told the BBC's Clive Coleman that a discussion with the police concluded that employing security would be \"sensible\" during the Supreme Court hearing.\n\nShe also told the Andrew Marr Show she was appalled by fierce criticism by the newspapers of the High Court judges who ruled on the case.\n\nThe Daily Mail branded the judges \"Enemies of the people\", while the Daily Express said the ruling had marked \"the day democracy died\".\n\nMs Miller said \"that is unforgivable\", saying they are \"the biggest brains in this country\".\n\n\"They are what make us great.\"", "description": "Gina Miller is the figurehead of two of the legal challenges to the Brexit process - but who is she?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4AAA/production/_92241191_mediaitem92241189.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
