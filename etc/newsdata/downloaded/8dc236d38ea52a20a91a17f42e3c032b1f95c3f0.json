I\u2019m somebody that would like not to have war,\u201d Trump said Monday, while also cautioning that the U.S. is \u201cprepared more than anybody\u201d to retaliate.\n\nBut Trump appeared defensive Tuesday evening of his approach toward Tehran after Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) tweeted that the White House\u2019s \u201cmeasured response\u201d to the shooting down an American drone in June \u201cwas clearly seen by the Iranian regime as a sign of weakness.\u201d\n\nTrump responded online: \u201cNo Lindsey, it was a sign of strength that some people just don\u2019t understand!\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

It\u2019s very easy to start,\" he told reporters in Los Angeles, adding: \"I think we have a lot of good capital. If we have to do something, we\u2019ll do it without hesitation.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo echoed that hardline rhetoric Wednesday before arriving in Saudi Arabia for talks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\n\u201cThis is an attack of a scale we\u2019ve just not seen before,\u201d he told reporters, according to Reuters. \u201cThe Saudis were the nation that were attacked. It was on their soil. It was an act of war against them directly.\u201d\n\nIran on Monday delivered an ominous message to U.S. officials through the Swiss Embassy in Tehran, denying involvement in the attack and \"warning that in case of any aggression against the Islamic Republic, Iran\u2019s response will be prompt and strong and it may include broader areas than the source of attacks,\" the Mehr News Agency reported.\n\nThe memo communicated that \"the Islamic Republic's reaction will be rapid and crushing and will likely target more extensive areas than the origin of the attack,\" Iran's state-run Fars News also reported.\n\nWhile Pompeo explicitly condemned Iran on Saturday for having \"launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply,\" Trump's more equivocal assessment of Iranian guilt earlier this week \u2014 paired with his apparent deference to the Saudi government in his weekend social media posts \u2014 provoked some consternation in Congress.\n\nStill, Trump has repeatedly suggested in recent days that Iran was behind the attack in Saudi Arabia, remarking Monday that \u201ccertainly it would look\u201d as though Tehran was responsible and accusing its leadership of promulgating \"a very big lie\" in relation to the destruction of the American drone earlier this summer.\n\nCol. Turki al-Maliki, a Saudi military spokesman, showed journalists at a news conference in Riyadh on Wednesday the remains of Iranian cruise missiles and drones he alleged were deployed in the attack on the kingdom's facilities, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\u201cThe attack was launched from the north and was unquestionably sponsored by Iran,\u201d he said, contradicting the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen who have claimed credit for the assault. Iran and Iraq are situated to the north of Saudi Arabia, while Yemen is located to the south.\n\nTrump's order Wednesday to hike sanctions on Iran comes as the Islamic Republic already faces punishing economic penalties the administration has leveled since withdrawing last year from the 2015 multinational nuclear deal.\n\nTensions have escalated and diplomacy has steadily deteriorated between Tehran and Washington, with a potential meeting between Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani now unlikely to take place on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly later this month.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) said Wednesday she applauded the president's latest sanctions maneuver, but called for a \u201cproportional military response\" to the attack in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cIt's got to be a response that is significant enough that it lets the Iranians know that this sort of attack on the global oil supply won\u2019t be accepted, that it won\u2019t go unanswered,\" Cheney, the chairwoman of the GOP conference, told reporters. \u201cThe Iranians have to understand that the United States is serious about our commitment to our allies.\u201d\n\nMelanie Zanona contributed to this report.", "description": "The president has hesitated to respond militarily to Tehran for allegedly disrupting the international crude oil supply.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/fa/69/91517f924585a571da0a0f453832/190918-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
