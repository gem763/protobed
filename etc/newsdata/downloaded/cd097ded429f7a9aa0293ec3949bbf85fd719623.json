Doug Jones (D-AL) in the Nov. 3, 2020 general election.\n\nHowever, there could be a familiar face among the list of candidates on the ballot.\n\nIn recent days, there has been rampant speculation that former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions could enter the contest for his old seat. Sessions held the seat currently occupied by Jones from 1997 through 2017. He gave up that seat to serve in the Trump administration until his unceremonious exit in late 2018.\n\nIf Sessions were to enter the race for the Republican Party\u2019s nomination, he would be joining a crowded field that includes former Auburn University head football coach Tommy Tuberville, U.S. Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-AL), Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, State Rep. Arnold Mooney (R) and former Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore.\n\nLate last month, Tuberville secured front-runner status by receiving the endorsement of the influential Alabama Farmers Federation. At the time and to this day, publicly available polling has shown Tuberville with a substantial lead over the rest of the field.\n\nOne poll leaked to the media last week showed Tuberville with a 21-point lead over second-place Roy Moore.\n\nTuberville\u2019s commanding lead hasn\u2019t stopped the insider buzz about Sessions entering the race. Privately and publicly, Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL) has made overtures about Sessions running in 2020.\n\nThat speculation reached a fever pitch this week as talk that polling was being conducted on Sessions\u2019 behalf to gauge public interest in his potential U.S. Senate candidacy.\n\nDuring an appearance on Huntsville, AL radio\u2019s WVNN on Friday, Alabama political columnist and Troy University political science professor Steve Flowers addressed the possibility of Sessions entering the field, adding that it has not gone unnoticed by other campaigns.\n\n\u201cIn my conversation with Coach Tuberville \u2013 he had two or three of his aides with him \u2013 they are very apprehensive that Sessions is going to run,\u201d Flowers said on \u201cThe Jeff Poor Show.\u201d \u201cI do know that there is a poll in the field right now trying to ascertain how he would do. I\u2019ll say this: A month ago, I would have told you \u2013 I may have told you on your show \u2013 I didn\u2019t think there was any chance Sessions was going to run. I think there\u2019s a possibility of it now. I\u2019m hearing strong rumors from all over the place. Nobody knows. I don\u2019t think Sessions knows, but I think Sessions is revisiting it.\u201d\n\nFlowers said he expected the falling out between Sessions and President Donald Trump to be a factor in a potential 2020 U.S. Senate run for Sessions. That falling out apparently remains fresh on Trump\u2019s mind, who described Sessions as both an \u201cembarrassment\u201d and a \u201cdisaster\u201d as U.S. attorney general in an interview with Sebastian Gorka for The Daily Caller published on Thursday.\n\n\u201cTwo different sides of it \u2013 Trump is so popular in the state, I think some of the crossfire they were in hurts Sessions, and then I don\u2019t know,\u201d Flowers said.\n\nFlowers predicted if Sessions did announce his candidacy, at least two of the candidates could seek other political opportunities.\n\n\u201cI do think this \u2013 I think he is heavy enough that if he did run, you might see two of the people, and I don\u2019t know this. I\u2019ve not talked to them about it. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see Bradley Byrne go back to his congressional race, and John Merrill go back and wait for 2022 rather than run against Jeff Sessions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Tuberville is in it,\u201d he continued. \u201cI think Moore is in it. I don\u2019t think they fold their tent. But I think Sessions is heavy enough that if he gets in there, he may run Byrne and Merrill home. I don\u2019t know that now, I just say that because if this time next week we\u2019re talking, and we find out Sessions is in there, it\u2019s not going to surprise. I don\u2019t think it happens, but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d\n\nSessions has not put to rest any of the rumors about his return to politics. During his appearance at a Madison County, AL Republican Party fundraiser earlier this month, he declined to answer questions from attendees about a potential 2020 U.S. Senate run.\n\nThe clock is ticking for Sessions to make a final decision. Qualifying began last week for Republican candidates and continues until Nov. 8. Thus far, only Adair, Merrill, Mooney and Tuberville have formally qualified.\n\nAlso up for grabs is Alabama\u2019s first congressional seat occupied by Byrne with several candidates including Mobile County Commissioner Jerry Carl, State Rep. Chris Pringle (R), restauranteur Wes Lambert and former State Sen. Bill Hightower currently campaigning for the post on the assumption Byrne is seeking the U.S. Senate. As of Saturday, no one has qualified as a GOP candidate for that seat.\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "description": "HUNTSVILLE, Alabama -- Republicans voters in Alabama will not go to the polls for another four and a half months to cast a ballot for who they would prefer to face incumbent Sen.
