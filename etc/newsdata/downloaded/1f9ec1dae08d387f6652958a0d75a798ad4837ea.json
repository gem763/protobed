The international benchmark was at $66.51 a barrel, up 10.5% from immediately before the attacks.\n\nThe attacks, which took supply totalling some 5.7 million barrels a day out of action, have had a twofold impact on prices. In addition to concerns about future shortfalls in the physical market, traders have had to build in higher geopolitical risk premiums into prices to protect themselves against the risk of further escalation.\n\nEscalation now looks virtually certain after Saudi officials corroborated U.S. claims that the weapons used in the attacks were Iranian and not \u2013 as earlier reported \u2013 launched by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\nPresident Donald Trump had indicated over the weekend that U.S. forces were prepared to strike Iran directly in retaliation, pending confirmation of its intelligence by Saudi Arabia.\n\nAside from the risk of escalation, the actual disruption to the physical market may be worse and longer than first thought.\n\nReports by Jones and Bloomberg cited people familiar with the matter as saying that officials at Saudi Aramco were no longer confident of restoring the damaged capacity quickly, having initially said they would replace one-third of the lost output already by Monday.\n\nThat\u2019s important because world crude stocks, while high, don\u2019t offer enough of a buffer to make up for the loss of so much Saudi capacity over a protracted length of time.\n\n\u201cThe world is not even close to being able to replace more than 5 million bpd day of Saudi Arabian exports,\u201d Bj\u00f8rnar Tonhaugen, head of oil market research at Rystad Energy, said in a note to clients. \u201cThe longer the processing facility remains disrupted, the larger the potential impact on actual crude flows will be.\u201d\n\nTonhaugen noted that Saudi Arabia currently has the equivalent of some 26 days of its exports in storage around the world, much of which is outside the Persian Gulf and therefore safe from any likely intervention by Iran or its proxies in Yemen.", "description": "Oil Prices Rise Again as U.S. Retaliation Against Iran Looms", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE7G0CO_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
