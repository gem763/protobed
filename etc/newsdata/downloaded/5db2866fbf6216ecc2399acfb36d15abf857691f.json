Earlier this week, the Washington Post reported that an intelligence official approached Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson \u201cwith claims that Trump had made troubling \u2018promises\u2019 during communication with a foreign leader.\u201d\n\nBoth Abby Huntsman and McCain argued that this anonymous whistleblower is like WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange because the individual \u201cput people\u2019s lives in danger.\n\nMcCain said that she thinks any interference in an election by a foreign country is bad and should be condemned, adding that she\u2019s mad that \u201cpeople on the left\u201d defend Assange for publishing secret military and diplomatic documents.\n\nHuntsman added that Assange\u2019s leaks, like releasing Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, are \u201cjust as dangerous as what the president is being charged with doing or people are assuming that he did\u201d and that it\u2019s putting people in danger.\n\nThe group then began talking over one another causing McCain to exclaim: \u201cExcuse me, maybe I was clumsy in the way that I said it.\u201d\n\nlol Meghan McCain stormed off after Ana Navarro said \u201cdon\u2019t scream at me, i\u2019m two feet away.\u201d pic.twitter.com/Gz2omi69LC \u2014 Ibrahim (@IbrahimAS97) September 20, 2019\n\nNavarro responded by telling McCain, \u201cI\u2019m two feet away, I don\u2019t need you to scream at me this way.\u201d\n\nMcCain replied that she didn\u2019t \u201cknow what you just said,\u201d leading Navarro to repeat: \u201cI said, don\u2019t scream at me. I\u2019m two feet away.\u201d\n\nHost Joy Behar moved the group to a commercial break as McCain is heard in the background calling Navarro \u201cso rude\u201d before eventually walking off the stage.\n\nAfter Ana Navarro put that BOOM down, Meghan stormed off and the looks on the faces of some audience members was priceless! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 #TheView pic.twitter.com/HqdeiGAHhq \u2014 Wayne Pittman, Jr. \u2712\ufe0f \ud83d\udc10\ud83d\udcaa (@Sony12Play) September 20, 2019\n\nMcCain came back after the break and didn\u2019t miss any of the show.
