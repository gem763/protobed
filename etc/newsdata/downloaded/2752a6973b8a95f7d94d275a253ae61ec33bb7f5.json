As a result, Martin was left with no other choice but to comply with Ben\u2019s wishes, and thus set about ensuring wife Stacey (Lacey Turner) stays away from the Square.\n\nAfter getting Ben arrested with some help from Jack (Scott Maslen), Martin was on cloud nine, as he believed his chaotic alliance with the young man was finally at an end. However, Ben\u2019s not one to let someone away with such a betrayal, and thus he set about reminding Martin of who\u2019s boss.\n\nMartin wasted little time in making up to Bex (Jasmine Armfield) for having neglected her as of late, but his plans were sabotaged by Ben and Tubbs, who kidnapped him and hung him upside down from the railway bridge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBen made clear that Martin will work for him until he sees fit to suggest otherwise, but when Martin refused to do so, Ben threatened to kill Stacey and all of their kids.\n\nKnowing he had no choice but do as Ben wishes, Martin continued to meet the young man\u2019s demands during tonight\u2019s episode. However, with Stacey wanting to return home, he needed to ensure that she stayed as far away from Walford as possible. As a result, he arranged to meet with her \u2014 outside the Square, of course.\n\nMartin awaited Stacey\u2019s arrival, but when she finally showed up she was devastated by the extent of his injuries. Faced with little choice, he was forced to lie about how he got said injuries.\n\nHowever, perceptive as ever, Stacey knew something was awry \u2014 and thus she threatened to go to Albert Square and uncover the mystery for herself. Knowing that was absolutely out of the question, Martin resorted to drastic measures to protect his wife.\n\nHe proceeded to tell Stacey that their marriage was over. However, Stacey wasn\u2019t buying it, so he was forced to go even further, and thus he told her he slept with Sonia (Natalie Cassidy).\n\nStacey was devastated at Martin\u2019s revelation, and thus she broke down.\n\nHas Martin\u2019s plan worked? Is this really the end of their marriage?\n\nEastEnders continues Tuesday 29thOctober at 7:30pm on BBC One.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "With Stacey wanting to come home to Walford, Martin was forced to resort to some pretty drastic measures to keep her away.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/martin-and-stacey-fowler-in-eastenders_1572270117.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
