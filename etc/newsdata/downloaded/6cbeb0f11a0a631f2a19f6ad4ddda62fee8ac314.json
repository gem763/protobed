In March, Cainiao smart lockers under Alibaba logistics unit also launched the function by using cameras to scan users' faces or personal QR codes.\n\nChina's two largest mobile payment platforms, WeChat and Alipay, also use the tech for logging in or transactions.\n\nIt varies on different platforms as the tech has been divided into 2D and 3D, some experts explained. The Hive Box camera collects facial data and then forms a 2D flat image, equal to a printed photo. It could be easily be decoded as it has a lower defined security level.\n\nMeanwhile, WeChat said it utilizes 3D depth-sensing tech to create a safe and secure e-payment environment. That has been tested to resist fraudulent attempts using videos, paper or masks with faces.\n\nExperts also warned users not to copy what some students did to Hive Box while using facial-recognition tech as a caution. The incident has also reminded the public of privacy concerns.\n\nEarlier in September, a Chinese face-swapping app Zao that lets users superimpose their face on those of celebrities and produce synthesized videos and emojis shared some similarities with the Hive Box. And it also later triggered enhanced regulatory oversight on data security and led to the app getting banned across online stores.", "description": "The self-serve package locker Hive Box made headlines again days earlier after it misled users to pay an extra yuan to get their parcels out from the express buffet cabinet.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/17/5da82d92a310cf3e97a1b928.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
