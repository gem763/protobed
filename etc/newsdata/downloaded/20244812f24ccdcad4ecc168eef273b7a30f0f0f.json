People need to understand that it\u2019s a crime against humanity\u2019.\n\n\u2018We have a responsibility to try and prevent that happening again.\n\n\u2018Holocaust survivors aren\u2019t getting any younger, they\u2019re a dying species and unfortunately we don\u2019t have them around for too much longer to tell their first hand accounts.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
