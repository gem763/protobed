(Picture: Primark)\n\nStacey Solomon is launching a new Primark collection and it\u2019s full of cosy knits.\n\nIf you\u2019re a mere mortal, you might be troubled by the sudden dip in temperatures. Figuring out how to still get some wear out of your beloved summer frock means you\u2019ve probably just acquired your Masters in artful layering. A hearty congrats to ya.\n\nElevating your cold-weather fashion game is no overnight feat, but Stacey Solomon\u2019s new Primark collection has arrived just in time.\n\nThe panellist is about to drop a new line of winter-ready office-to-drinks ensembles this week.\n\nWhen it comes to bottoms, there\u2019s an on-trend snake print A-line skirt, sleek leather-look trousers and a pleated black skirt. There\u2019s also a cream jumper that looks cosy enough to sleep in and a teddy coat that appears to be a big ol\u2019 (fashion) hug.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis comfort factor happened to be all part of Stacey\u2019s grand plan.\n\nPrices range from \u00a313 jumpers to \u00a36 roll necks to \u00a315 dresses. (Picture: Primark)\n\n\u2018There are skirts you can wear with heels or trainers, baggy jumpers and statement tops. It\u2019s all super comfy because I can only wear comfy these days,\u2019 Stacey said in a statement.\n\nThe mum-of-three has also designed a few items for her fellow life-givers, including a sloppy joe and a plain white tee that defines your trusty mother as \u2018friend for life, teacher, loves conditionally. caring, nourishes, peace keeper, comforting\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since she released her first collection with the high street brand, a line so popular it sold out in some stores. One of the skirts even ended up being sold on eBay for twice the original price.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m so overwhelmed and excited to have been asked to design another collection for Primark. I\u2019m so thrilled that my last collection went down so well, and I can\u2019t quite believe I\u2019m doing it all again.\u2019\n\nOf course, the stunning singer modelled the line herself. Check out some of her favourite looks:\n\nPrices of the collection range from \u00a313 jumpers to \u00a36 roll necks to \u00a315 dresses.\n\nThe new line will drop this Thursday, October 10, so there\u2019 still time take stock of your existing autumn/winter lewks.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The Celebrity Juice panellist is about to drop a new line of winter-ready office-to-drinks ensembles this week.", "authors": ["Serena Coady"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_88964580_1570529014.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
