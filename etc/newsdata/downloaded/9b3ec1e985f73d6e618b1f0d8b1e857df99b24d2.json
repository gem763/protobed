The firm has focused its efforts on the production of a pizza-making robot which now appears to be almost ready to go to market.\n\n\u201cFood is hard. It\u2019s highly variable,\u201d said Picnic CEO Clayton Wood. \u201cWe learned a lot about food science in the process of developing the system.\u201d Journalist James Thorne who was invited to see Picnic\u2019s pizza-making machine, describing it as a \u201cwhite, kitchen-sized iPhone.\u201d\n\nI visited Seattle startup @PicnicNews last week to see how their pizza robot can assemble 300 pies per hour. Here's a video of the system in action. pic.twitter.com/gz3795H9YE \u2014 James Thorne (@jamescthorne) October 1, 2019\n\nPizza making machines are not entirely new, but Picnic sets its robot apart in a number of ways. Its machine is much smaller than industrial-sized pizza makers, the recipes can be easily tweaked for each restaurant, and the ingredients used are fresh.\n\nPicnic\u2019s machine is capable of producing 300 12-inch pizzas per hour, much faster than most restaurants could produce pizzas by hand. What sets Picnics robot apart from competitors as well is that certain elements are still left up to the restaurant chefs, such as dough preparation, sauce making, and baking.\n\nPicnic\u2019s business model for the pizza-making system is quite simple, owners pay a regular fee to use the system in their restaurant and in return, they receive ongoing maintenance as well as hardware and software updates. \u201cPeople are getting more accustomed to the idea of not owning technology because they perceive it to be something that changes quickly. They don\u2019t want to buy a major investment and have it be obsolete in three years,\u201d said Wood.\n\nKati Fritz-Jung, a former Little Caesars executive who serves as an advisor to Picnic, commented on the future of the firm stating: \u201cThe potential for Picnic\u2019s technology is broad-reaching for the pizza and other food industries. Innovations like this will change the way we approach customer service, product quality, operational costs and overall consumer satisfaction.\u201d\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
