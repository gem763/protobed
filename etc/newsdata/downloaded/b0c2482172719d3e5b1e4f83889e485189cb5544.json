It was just something I wanted to have a good think about.\n\n\"After the World Cup and this time as well Arnie had a big part to play in me wanting to hang around. A lot of discussions we had definitely helped me decide to stay on for a little bit longer.\n\n\"That's a good understanding that we have. I don't want to be holding anyone else back but also saying that I need to make sure I'm here for the right reasons for me as well.\n\n\"There's a number of things but at the moment it's still a good fit.\"\n\nReleased by Scottish club Hibernian, Milligan landed at English League One club Southend United in July.\n\nPlaying in the notoriously gruelling 22-team English lower divisions has proven he can still mix it physically and he credits the move to Roots Hall for re-energising him as well.\n\n\"It's been good, it's kept me very fit,\" he said.\n\n\"Proved a lot of things to me that I can still do, that my body can handle and can still cope. Probably the expectation was that I didn't know if I'd be able to or not.\n\n\"Just from the physical side of things, it's been good, reassuring.\"\n\nAs to whether Milligan can keep going to a fifth World Cup, the jury is still out.\n\n\"It's very much short-term at the moment in terms of the qualification period,\" he said.\n\n\"There's a number of things I feel I can help with this team still and I can still bring, for me on the field was not really the issue. I know what my body's capable of, it was more the expectations that are placed on me outside of that.\n\n\"I want to make sure that I could fulfil them.\"\n\nThe Socceroos will train at Kaohsiung's National Stadium on Monday ahead of Tuesday's qualifier, which kicks off at 7.40pm (2240AEDT).", "description": "Socceroos captain Mark Milligan credits a series of in-depth discussions with coach Graham Arnold for convincing him to play on for Australia.Just as he did...", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
