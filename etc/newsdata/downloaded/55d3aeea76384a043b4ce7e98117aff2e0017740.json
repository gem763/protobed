And although he has conceded \u201cthere may be a United Nations violation,\u201d the president says any concerns are overblown.\n\nKim Jong-un, North Korea\u2019s leader, Mr. Trump explained recently, just \u201clikes testing missiles.\u201d\n\nNow, American intelligence officials and outside experts have come to a far different conclusion: that the launchings downplayed by Mr. Trump, including two late last month, have allowed Mr. Kim to test missiles with greater range and maneuverability that could overwhelm American defenses in the region.\n\nJapan\u2019s defense minister, Takeshi Iwaya, told reporters in Tokyo last week that the irregular trajectories of the most recent tests were more evidence of a program designed to defeat the defenses Japan has deployed, with American technology, at sea and on shore.\n\nMr. Kim\u2019s flattery of Mr. Trump with beguiling letters and episodic meetings offering vague assurances of eventual nuclear disarmament, some outside experts say, are part of what they call the North Korean leader\u2019s strategy of buying time to improve his arsenal despite all the sanctions on North Korea.", "description": "American intelligence officials and outside experts say that Kim Jong-un is capitalizing on a diplomatic standoff with President Trump to significantly improve his arsenal.", "authors": ["David E.
