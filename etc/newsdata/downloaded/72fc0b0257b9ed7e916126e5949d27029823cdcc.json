REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/Files\n\nDuring previous big events in a capital long plagued by festering pollution, the government has pulled out all the stops to guarantee air quality - seeding clouds for rain to wash the pollution away, restricting traffic, and shutting factories, shops and construction sites.\n\nBeijing will close building sites, curb fireworks and restrict fuel sales ahead of the National Day celebrating the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China. But government officials say the era of economically disruptive \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d crackdowns is over, replaced by a more nuanced approach at a time when the country\u2019s economy is creaking under the pressure of its trade war with the United States.\n\nThough there is still time for a clampdown, executives at major heavy industrial firms believe sweeping closures are not yet on the agenda - as long as routine smog controls continue to do the job. An independent survey last week showed Beijing is on track to drop out from the list of the world\u2019s top 200 most-polluted cities this year.\n\nChina\u2019s biggest cement producer, China National Building Materials Corp, is one that hasn\u2019t yet received any formal notification, and doesn\u2019t expect special measures.\n\n\u201cI think that if there are measures they won\u2019t necessarily be connected with National Day,\u201d Cui Xingtai, vice-president of the state-run company with facilities across the country, told Reuters during a recent interview. \u201cIn certain seasons, some places can introduce policies to alleviate the extent of air pollution.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, officials with three small independent refineries in Shandong province, south of the capital, also told Reuters they were not anticipating stiffer cuts in production before October.\n\nProvincial authorities do have the Oct. 1 anniversary in focus: Hebei, which surrounds Beijing, has launched an inspection of coal mines which it explicitly says is designed to prevent any accident ahead of the anniversary celebrations.\n\nMeanwhile the province has imposed production curbs in Tangshan, China\u2019s biggest steelmaking city, after a rise in smog earlier this month.\n\n\u201cThe Tangshan plan didn\u2019t mention National Day but it\u2019s clearly a big part of the motivation,\u201d said Lauri Myllyvirta, senior energy analyst with Greenpeace.\n\nAs Oct. 1 approaches, industry sources said production cuts could get tougher, especially in Tangshan and other cities close to Beijing, but comprehensive shutdowns were still unlikely.\n\nThe environment ministry said on Tuesday that mostly favourable weather would keep pollution in check over September, though concentrations of small floating particles known as PM2.5 were forecast to rise slightly in Beijing in the last 10 days of the month.\n\n\u201cThere has been no official notice, though there\u2019s still time,\u201d said an industry consultant with ties to the Tangshan Iron and Steel Association who declined to be identified because he wasn\u2019t authorised to speak to media. \u201cControls will definitely be stricter before National Day.\u201d\n\nLiu Qingxi, manager of a cement plant owned by Anhui Conch in Tongling city, about 1,200 kilometres south of Beijing by road, told Reuters the company only expected to take action if air quality deteriorated significantly.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve not been told anything yet but if there are bad weather conditions they might ask us to stop production,\u201d he said.", "description": "When the sun comes up in Beijing on Oct. 1, the Chinese government will aim to celebrate its 70th birthday under a brilliant blue sky - and factory bosses hope they can get through it without blanket closures.", "authors": ["David Stanway", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430699770&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G08O", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
