His blue Scania truck was impounded.\n\nEssex police say they are \u2018liaising\u2019 with their Irish counterparts over the case.\n\nThe man was arrested and appeared in court over a road accident in Germany.\n\nIt came as a married couple from Cheshire and a man from Northern Ireland held last week were released on police bail. The man detained in Dublin is from Co Down in Northern Ireland and according to his social media posts drives his lorry all over Europe.\n\nA van from the Border Force enters the Port of Tilbury, Essex, after the bodies of 39 people were found inside a lorry in nearby Grays on Wednesday\n\nHe is said to have been identified from CCTV showing the container believed to be carrying the migrants arriving at Zeebrugge at 2.49pm last Tuesday, hours before the tragic discovery in Essex, the Brussels public prosecutor said yesterday.\n\nThe man was remanded in custody by a court in Dublin on Saturday which dealt only with allegations of assault and criminal damage relating to the accident in Germany.\n\nHis solicitor said the man had planned to make himself available to Irish police to assist with an investigation in Northern Ireland.
