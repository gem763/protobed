Pontius Pilate was the fifth governor of the Roman province of Judaea. He is best known for presiding over the trial of Jesus and ordering his crucifixion \u2014 events detailed in both the Bible and record from Jewish and Roman historians of the time. While there are few records detailing Pilate's time in office, his long tenure suggests he was a competent governor. However, the Jewish historian Josephus and philosopher Philo of Alexandria both recount incidents of tension and violence between Pilate's administration and the Jewish population. Pilate is believed to have been removed from office after violently suppressing an armed Samaritan movement at Mount Gerizim. He was sent to return to answer for his actions before the Roman emperor Tiberius, but the latter died before Pilate arrived home to Rome.\n\nThe 722 feet (220 metre) -long section of road was unearthed by researchers from the Israel Antiquities Authority and Tel Aviv University after six years of extensive archaeological excavations.\n\nThe walkway ascends from the Pool of Siloam in the south to the Temple Mount \u2014 both sites of significance to the followers of Judaism and Christianity.\n\nThe Temple Mount, located within the Old City of Jerusalem, has been venerated as a holy site for thousands of years.\n\nAccording to the bible, the Pool of Siloam was the location where Jesus performed the miracle of healing the man born blind, at around the same as the street was being constructed.\n\nDuring the dig, the team uncovered more than 100 coins trapped beneath the street's paving stones.\n\nThe latest coins were dated between 17\u201331 AD \u2014 firm evidence that work began and was completed during the time that Pilate governed Judea.\n\n'Dating using coins is very exact,' said paper author and archaeologist Donald Ariel, of the Israel Antiquities Authority.'\n\n'As some coins have the year in which they were minted on them, what that means is that if a coin with the date on it is found beneath the street, the street had to be built in the same year or after that coin had been minted, so any time after.'\n\n'However, our study goes further, because statistically, coins minted some 10 years later are the most common coins in Jerusalem.'\n\n'So not having them beneath the street means the street was built before their appearance, in other words only in the time of Pilate.'\n\nArchaeologists have unearthed part of a 2,000-year-old 'lost' street, pictured, built by Pontius Pilate that likely served as a route for pilgrimage within the ancient city\n\nThe ancient walkway linking the Temple Mount with the Pool of Siloam, pictured in this artist's impression, was first discovered in 1894 by British archaeologists in Jerusalem's 'City of David'\n\nAccording to the bible, the Pool of Siloam was the location where Jesus performed the miracle of healing the man born blind, at around the same as the street was being constructed\n\nThe street \u2014 which was 0.37 miles (600 metres) -long and around 26 feet (eight metres) wide \u2014 was paved with the large stone slabs that were customary across the Roman Empire.\n\nThe researchers estimate that some 10,000 tons of quarried limestone rock would have been used in its construction \u2014 a feat requiring considerable skill.\n\nThe opulent and grand nature of the street, coupled with the fact that it links two of the most important spots in Jerusalem \u2014 Temple Mount and the Pool of Siloam and \u2014 both provide strong evidence that the street acted as a route for pilgrims.\n\n'If this was a simple walkway connecting point A to point B, there would be no need to build such a grand street,' said paper author and Israel Antiquities Authority archaeologist Joe Uziel.\n\n'At its minimum it is eight metres wide. This, coupled with its finely carved stone and ornate \"furnishings\" like a stepped podium along the street, all indicate that this was a special street.'\n\nPilate is best known as the biblical official who presided over the trial of Jesus and ordered his crucifixion, as depicted in this painting\n\nThe street \u2014 which was 0.37 miles (600 metres) -long and around 26 feet (eight metres) wide \u2014 was paved with the large stone slabs that were customary across the Roman Empire\n\n'Part of it may have been to appease the residents of Jerusalem,' added paper co-author and archaeologist Nahshon Szanton.\n\n'Part of it may have been about the way Jerusalem would fit in the Roman world, and part of it may have been to aggrandise [Pontius Pilate's] name through major building projects.'\n\nThe paving stones of the street were found hidden beneath layers of rubble, which researchers believe was generated when Romans captured and destroyed the city in 70 AD.\n\nThis rubble contained weapons \u2014 including arrowheads and stones for slings \u2014 along with the remains of burnt trees and collapsed stones from the buildings along its edge.\n\nThe researchers say that it is possible that Pilate had the street built in order to help reduce tensions with the Jewish population.\n\n'We can't know for sure, although all these reasons do find support in the historical documents,' added Dr Ariel.\n\nThe full findings of the study were published in Tel Aviv: Journal of the Institute of Archaeology of Tel Aviv University.", "description": "The 722 feet (220 metre) -long section of road was unearthed by researchers from the Israel Antiquities Authority and Tel Aviv University after\u00a0six years of digging in Jerusalem.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/10/19984670-0-image-a-37_1571651684210.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
