And the process is coming together little by little.\n\n\u201cNicolas will be more confident after Thursday. This club follows a lot of players all around the world, because we have very good scouts. We are very happy with Pepe.\n\n\u201cWe need patience and to be calm with him, help him and protect him because he can think he is playing under pressure.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAlthough Zaha is yet to score for Palace this season, Emery knows his players will have to keep an on the winger when Arsenal host Roy Hodgson's side on Sunday.\n\nOn the subject of the 26-year-old, who was also a target for Everton , the Gunners boss added: \u201cHe is a very good player and he has been the difference in a lot of matches against us.\n\n\u201cBut we have players who can stop him and impose our capacity, our organisation on them.\n\n\"For sure he is very motivated - but our challenge is how we can stop him and use our own quality.\u201d\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nMeanwhile, Pepe said he was grateful for the faith and support Emery has shown him as he continues to get up to speed in the Premier League.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe manager trusts me. Even if I hadn\u2019t been decisive, it is always important to have the manager\u2019s faith.\n\n\u201cOf course I knew it would be hard. This is totally different to Ligue 1, a different intensity.\n\n\u201cI had to adapt quickly because expectations were high. Unfortunately, that is not what I did at the beginning - but I had the manager\u2019s trust and the players have supported me.\u201d", "description": "The Ivory Coast international scored two stunning free kicks for the Gunners during midweek's Europa League win", "authors": ["Hassan Rashed", "Image", "Reuters", "Pa", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20719090.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Europa-League-Group-F-Arsenal-v-Vitoria-SC.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
