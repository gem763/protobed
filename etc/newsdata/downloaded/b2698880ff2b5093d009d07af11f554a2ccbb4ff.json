It\u2019s something Russians call beznadyoga \u2014 a collective feeling of hopelessness that paralyzes any sustained effort to overturn the status quo and marginalizes those who try.\n\nIt\u2019s this aspect of the collective Russian psyche that the opposition, led by Alexei Navalny, smashed on Sunday, after a two-month marathon of protests in the Russian capital.\n\nChange comes excruciatingly slowly in Russia. Brief periods of optimism typically end in catastrophic upheavals.\n\nThe formal result of the city council election was, perhaps, not all that spectacular. Liberal candidates, barred from standing themselves, had to resort to promoting a tactical voting campaign that unseated nearly half of all Kremlin-backed candidates, but also saw most of those seats go to the Communists and two smaller parties, which are under the influence of the Kremlin to some degree.\n\nAnd yet, the campaign\u2019s success has endowed opposition and protest leaders, including Navalny, with greater legitimacy in the Russian capital than many of the Kremlin-backed politicians who were only able to secure their seats through manipulation and electoral fraud.\n\nChange comes excruciatingly slowly in Russia. Brief periods of optimism typically end in catastrophic upheavals. But there is reason to believe that this time Navalny\u2019s optimism and confidence has infected an increasingly large swath of the voting population \u2014 and empowered a new group of liberal opposition leaders.\n\nThe Kremlin is right to be alarmed. In a poll conducted by the independent pollster Levada Center last month, 37 percent of Muscovites supported the citywide protests, while some 27 percent said they did not. Those are striking numbers in a highly centralized country where the survival of the political regime depends on who controls the capital.\n\nOther regions are also showing signs of following in Moscow\u2019s footsteps. The ruling party may have won most of the regional elections that also took place on Sunday, but it lost many local council seats nationwide.\n\nIn Khabarovsk Territory, for example, Putin\u2019s party retained just two out of 36 seats in a regional assembly it used to control. In St. Petersburg, the election was marred by what appeared to be blatant fraud that will almost certainly add fuel to the already raging fire.\n\nFor Putin, the problem is how to contain the rapidly spreading discontent.\n\nHe won\u2019t be able to repeat the move that \u2014 following the Bolotnaya Square protests of 2011-2012 \u2014 caused his popularity ratings to shoot through the roof: the annexation of Crimea.\n\nThere is simply no other piece of land in Russia\u2019s vicinity that would evoke the same feeling of historical injustice, with an overwhelmingly pro-Russian population with deep family and personal links to Russia.\n\nNor are there any upheavals in sight on the scale of Ukraine\u2019s Maidan Revolution that could turn any other territory into a \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d for Putin to pick. Crucially, there is very little appetite in Russian society for territorial expansion that can\u2019t be convincingly framed as saving \u201cour people\u201d from imminent threat.\n\nOther methods of shoring up support haven\u2019t yielded good results. In the five years since the Crimean annexation, the Kremlin tried to win the trust of Muscovites by pouring billions into a very thorough reconstruction of Moscow streets and transport infrastructure.\n\nThe move turned the capital into an attractive and liveable city \u2014 and certainly the most modern in the former USSR, including in the Baltic countries \u2014 but it did little to mitigate the protests. In fact, the lack of public debate about the reconstruction, coupled with rampant corruption and the fact that the city became a gigantic construction site for a few years, angered many more voters.\n\nThe regime Putin created reflected the expectations of Russian society two decades ago. But that generation is giving way to the next.\n\nPerhaps Putin\u2019s best hope for a breather would be to strike an agreement with Ukraine to end the armed conflict in the Donbas region \u2014 and, by extension, Russia\u2019s isolation on the world stage.\n\nThere are clear signs of d\u00e9tente between the two countries since the comedian-turned-president Volodymyr Zelenskiy took office, including a large scale prisoner swap last week and ramped up diplomatic efforts by the likes of French President Emmanuel Macron to normalize relations between Russia and the West.\n\nBut just as Crimea eventually failed to change the trajectory of Putin\u2019s political decline, so will any other foreign policy stunt the Kremlin could conceivably come up with.\n\nRussia\u2019s slide toward authoritarianism under Putin has obscured tectonic cultural shifts that are pushing the country in the opposite direction. And now the cracks are coming to the surface.\n\nPeople have been getting wealthier, more cosmopolitan and have largely recovered from the traumas of the Soviet era and the turbulent 1990s. New social strata have emerged, along with a vibrant civil society. A whole new generation is coming of age that wants to see something other than Putin before they grow old.\n\nThe regime Putin created reflected the expectations of Russian society two decades ago. But that generation is giving way to the next. And Putin won\u2019t be able to outrun them.\n\nLeonid Ragozin is a freelance journalist based in Riga.", "description": "With Moscow city council vote, Russia\u2019s liberal opposition scored a major victory.", "authors": ["Leonid Ragozin", "Marc Bennetts"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1024582196-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
