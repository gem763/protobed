(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Washington Nationals\u2019 chances worsened with almost every pitch Roenis El\u00edas threw to a left-handed batter on Tuesday night. The reliever, himself a lefty acquired at the trade deadline for situations just like those, got rocked.\n\nThe first batter he faced, the Mets\u2019 Jeff McNeil, homered to lead off the eighth. Brandon Nimmo did the same on El\u00edas\u2019s first pitch of the ninth. El\u00edas got one lefty out in between on a pop up from Michael Conforto, but followed the Nimmo blast by allowing a single to lefty Joe Panik. Manager Dave Martinez jogged out of the dugout and El\u00edas\u2019s night was over.\n\nEl\u00edas later asserted \u201cthere\u2019s nothing wrong, that\u2019s baseball.\u201d He explained Tuesday\u2019s outing nose-dived more because of location than stuff, and said that will improve with more innings as he works his way back from the injured list; he returned to the team Friday after spending a month there with a right hamstring strain.\n\n\u201cThose pitches I left over the plate that got hit out?\u201d El\u00edas said in Spanish through a team translator. \u201cIf I locate them where I want to locate them, they don't hit that. That's the biggest thing.\u201d\n\n[Hours after historic comeback, Nationals can\u2019t recapture the magic in 8-4 loss to Mets]\n\nThe Nationals are running out of time. Their lack of a reliable lefty-on-lefty matchup option is a concerning development and, coupled with an impending four-game series against the NL East-leading Atlanta Braves \u2014 the team with one of the game\u2019s best left-handed hitters in Freddie Freeman \u2014 it has prompted a bigger question. Who can the Nationals trust to get left-handed hitters out?\n\nMartinez remains convinced it must be El\u00edas. He believes El\u00edas\u2019s struggles against left-handed hitters stems from too much fastball, not enough breaking ball. He wants his reliever to use the \u201creally good\u201d change-up more. Yet El\u00edas\u2019s Tuesday night struggles were not atypical.\n\nLeft-handed hitters have a .981 on-base-plus-slugging percentage against El\u00edas this season, the seventh-worst rate of the 120 lefties who have pitched 10 or more innings. But this year is out-of-character for El\u00edas, who has allowed a .717 OPS to left-handed hitters in his career. The question of whether he\u2019ll figure out what\u2019s going wrong is crucial with 23 games left.\n\nEl\u00edas agrees with Martinez that he needs to adapt. He thinks this down year is because hitters understand the scouting report on him now \u2014 \u201cvery aggressive in the strike zone\u201d \u2014 and they\u2019ve recalibrated. But he believes the necessary tweaks amount to simply throwing more sliders and pounding the zone inside to left-handed hitters. He stressed again that he needs more game situations to actualize the adjustment.\n\n\u201cWhat I feel like I need to do is keep pitching,\u201d El\u00edas said. \u201cThat\u2019s basically it.\u201d\n\nThe manager understands this, and he saw Tuesday\u2019s outing as a hiccup.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not down on him at all,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cHe came off the IL, and we got to get him out there.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cAnd he\u2019s got to get lefties out.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals need El\u00edas because they have few other options. Two lefties they carried earlier in the season, Tony Sipp and Matt Grace, have been designated for assignment There are no real solutions in the minors and meaningful free agent signings in September are rare. Plus, the team must weigh ability against fit because players praise the team\u2019s chemistry almost every time they step in the clubhouse.\n\n[Nats\u2019 stretch run promises more lessons from book of baseball: Don\u2019t get too high or low.]\n\nThe Nationals do, however, have one other left-hander in the bullpen. He has, even in a down year, posted good numbers against left-handed batters. But Sean Doolittle is supposed to be the closer. Right?\n\nMartinez asserted that was still Doolittle\u2019s role until he returned last week from his rehab assignment. Then the two met and Doolittle said his stuff wasn\u2019t there. His fastball dipped from about 94 mph in the majors to barely touching 90 for Class A Potomac, so they decided he shouldn\u2019t close. They concluded, for the time being, to use Doolittle in low-leverage situations while he rebuilds his arm. Therein lies the opportunity to experiment with him as the lefty specialist.\n\nDoolittle is already on board. He said in April \u201cyou can\u2019t have an ego in the bullpen\u201d and has demonstrated his commitment to actualizing the statement ever since. He said, when the Nationals activated him, he would do whatever it took in his return. On Wednesday, after a scoreless ninth inning against the Mets, he and Martinez said was as good as he has in a while. He touched 94 mph again and his spin rate increased.\n\n\u201cThe ball was really coming out,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nBut Doolittle is not sure what\u2019s next. He doubled down on his commitment to do whatever the team needed.\n\n\u201cHopefully I\u2019ll be in the mix in some capacity in Atlanta,\u201d he said, \u201cespecially with the lefties they have in their lineup.\u201d\n\nThis option of Doolittle as the lefty specialist is presumptive. It doesn\u2019t account for how Martinez might navigate the decision with his tightknit clubhouse. It doesn\u2019t account for who would become the closer and if that pitcher has the mentality for it, though Daniel Hudson seems like a candidate. It doesn\u2019t account for how the Nationals\u2019 relievers themselves might adjust, or what they then might do with El\u00edas.\n\nIt does account for who can get left-handed hitters out, though, and that\u2019s what matters.\n\nThe Nationals will still likely go to El\u00edas the next time they need a lefty specialist, to give him the chance to work through this. But, as the season gets shorter and the moments bigger, each decision becomes more important. There are plenty of fearsome left-handed hitters on deck.\n\nRead more:\n\nAfter a miracle comeback from a broken arm, Aaron Barrett aims to prove he belongs in MLB\n\nNationals\u2019 stunning rally over the Mets could be a springboard toward October\n\nThe seven best reactions to Nats\u2019 insane walk-off win over the Mets\n\nNats fan who snagged Kurt Suzuki\u2019s walk-off homer: \u2018I blacked out and then I caught the ball\u2019\n\nDespite a bumpy inning, Max Scherzer feels encouraged as workload climbs", "description": "Roenis El\u00edas has struggled this season against left-handed hitters, and that's something Manager Dave Martinez recognizes his team can't afford.", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter", "September At Am", "Sam Fortier Is A Sports Reporter For The Washington Post."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/X0NSugBeuuqLX2teC2cbK9iRMSA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DGD7E3GPRMI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
