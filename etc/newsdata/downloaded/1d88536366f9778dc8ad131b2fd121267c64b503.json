This 'Essence' cover honors the monumental moment.", "language": "en", "text": "After becoming Miss USA, Miss Teen USA and Miss America, the three women are still reigning supreme and racking up the wins. The trio\u2019s most recent achievement: appearing together on the cover of Essence magazine to honor the beauty of black women and the importance of inclusion.\n\nIn the feature, \u201cOur Crowns, Our Glory: America's Reigning Beauty Queens Are Black, Bold and Rocking Many Crowns,\u201d Cheslie Kryst (Miss USA), Kaliegh Garris (Miss Teen USA) and Nia Franklin (Miss America) talk making history this year as their wins in their respective pageants marked the first time black women held those titles simultaneously.\n\n\u201cMy title and my crown mean a chance to be inclusive,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cIt gives me the opportunity to represent a group that has not always been represented in this country.\u201d\n\nEven when Vanessa Williams became the first black woman to win the Miss America pageant, her 1984 feat was shortly overshadowed by controversy as she not only received racist hate mail, she was also forced to give up her crown over nude photos taken prior to her win. Though Carole Gist won Miss USA in 1990, Janel Bishop won Miss Teen USA in 1991 and other black winners would go on to be crowned, Kryst noted that dated beauty standards often left women of color feeling unwelcome in beauty pageants.\n\n\u201cPageants weren\u2019t always welcoming to women of color. It took decades of persistence and courageous women showing the world a new kind of beauty,\u201d Kryst said.\n\nGarris said securing her title made such a difference in her life \u201cnot only because I am a woman of color but also because I am biracial.\u201d\n\nSocial media users praised the beauty queens\u2019 spread as Black Girl Magic.\n\nThey are all beautiful \ud83d\udc93#blackgirlmagic WE ROCK!!! \u2014 laine (@only1laine) October 3, 2019\n\nCongratulations Queens. \u2014 Krazy4Bope AndKrazy4Cin Krazy4Drake (@KRAZY4BOANDHOPE) October 3, 2019\n\nThis is art \ud83d\ude0d \u2014 Caroline Weinroth (@carofinew) September 28, 2019\n\n\u201cEssence you did a beautiful job on this cover.
