Indeed, the FlyPOP news feed since 2016 has been largely devoted to celebrating key Indian holidays.\n\nBut in June it announced the opening of a new corporate HQ at Stansted, the Essex airport from where it plans to fly to Amritsar and Ahmedabad. A sign that flights could soon start? Perhaps.\n\nIn a July interview with the website Simple Flying, Singh Judge said he hoped the inaugural flight would be within six months.\n\nBut don\u2019t bet your mortgage on it. The airline is still firmly in the funding stage and is yet to receive approval to operate from the Civil Aviation Authority. It now hopes to raise a total of \u00a36m by the end of 2019. Telegraph Travel has contacted it for further comment.", "description": "", "authors": ["Oliver Smith", "Digital Travel Editor", "Hugh Morris", "Annabel Fenwick Elliott"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2019/October/pop-top-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
