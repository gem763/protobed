The U.S. Commerce Department said each firm is implicated in human rights abuses perpetrated by the Chinese government against Muslim minorities. (New York Times)\n\nTalking point: Washington said the move wasn\u2019t connected to trade negotiations, which are set to resume Thursday, for the first time citing human rights concerns as a reason for banning Chinese companies. The bans could seriously undermine China\u2019s burgeoning AI industry and curb the country\u2019s stated goal of becoming a global leader in the field by 2030. Several companies\u2014including Hikvision, the world\u2019s largest maker of video-surveillance equipment\u2014have strongly condemned the decision. Many of the newly banned firms, which are now effectively disallowed from buying American products, rely on U.S.-made parts and will have to move their supply chains elsewhere. That could bolster Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s existing directive to increase self-sufficiency in the country\u2019s tech sector.", "description": "", "authors": ["Liza Agrba"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
