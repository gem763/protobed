When news broke last month that congressional Democrats were opening an impeachment inquiry, the campaign responded with an advertising blitz aimed at firing up the president\u2019s base.\n\nSign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter\n\nThe campaign slapped together an \u201cImpeachment Poll\u201d (sample question: \u201cDo you agree that President Trump has done nothing wrong?\u201d). It invited supporters to join the Official Impeachment Defense Task Force (\u201cAll you need to do is DONATE NOW!\u201d). It produced a slick video laying out the debunked conspiracy theory about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Ukraine that is now at the center of the impeachment battle (\u201cLearn the truth. Watch Now!\u201d).\n\nThe onslaught overwhelmed the limited Democratic response. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign put up the stiffest resistance: It demanded Facebook take down the ad, only to be rebuffed. It then proceeded with plans to slash its online advertising budget in favor of more television ads.\n\n< PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 4 NEXT SLIDE > An ad seeking contributions for Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election bid. \u00a9 Provided by The New York Times Company\n\nThat campaigns are now being fought largely online is hardly a revelation, yet only one political party seems to have gotten the message. While the Trump campaign has put its digital operation firmly at the center of the president\u2019s re-election effort, Democrats are struggling to internalize the lessons of the 2016 race and adapt to a political landscape shaped by social media.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s first campaign took far better advantage of Facebook and other platforms that reward narrowly targeted \u2014 and, arguably, nastier \u2014 messages. And while the president is now embattled on multiple fronts and disfavored by a majority of Americans in most polls, he has one big advantage: His 2020 campaign, flush with cash, is poised to dominate online again, according to experts on both ends of the political spectrum, independent researchers and tech executives. The difference between the parties\u2019 digital efforts, they said, runs far deeper than the distinction between an incumbent\u2019s general-election operation and challengers\u2019 primary campaigns.\n\nThe Trump team has spent the past three years building out its web operation. As a sign of its priorities, the 2016 digital director, Brad Parscale, is now leading the entire campaign. He is at the helm of what experts described as a sophisticated digital marketing effort, one that befits a relentlessly self-promoting candidate who honed his image, and broadcast it into national consciousness, on reality television.\n\nThe campaign under Mr. Parscale is focused on pushing its product \u2014 Mr. Trump \u2014 by churning out targeted ads, aggressively testing the content and collecting data to further refine its messages. It is selling hats, shirts and other gear, a strategy that yields yet more data, along with cash and, of course, walking campaign billboards.\n\n\u201cWe see much less of that kind of experimentation with the Democratic candidates,\u201d said Laura Edelson, a researcher at New York University who tracks political advertising on Facebook. \u201cThey\u2019re running fewer ads. We don\u2019t see the wide array of targeting.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign, she said, \u201cis like a supercar racing a little Volkswagen Bug.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats would be the Volkswagen. They are largely running what other experts and political operatives compared to brand-loyalty campaigns, trying to sway moderates and offend as few people as possible, despite mounting research that suggests persuasion ads have little to no impact on voters in a general election.\n\n\u00a9 Scott McIntyre for The New York Times Andrew Gillum, a former Democratic candidate for governor of Florida, in Miami this year. Two people on his campaign clashed over the tone of an ad.\n\nThe candidates, to be sure, are collectively spending more on Facebook and Google than on television and are trying to target their ads \u2014 Mr. Biden\u2019s tend to be seen by those born before 1975, for instance, while Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s are aimed at those born later. But without the same level of message testing and data collection, the Democrats\u2019 efforts are not nearly as robust as Mr. Trump\u2019s.\n\n[Read more on how Democrats are using Facebook to reach specific voters.]\n\nDemocratic digital operatives say the problem is a party dominated by an aging professional political class that is too timid in the face of a fiercely partisan Republican machine. The Biden campaign\u2019s decision to tack from digital to television, they say, is only the most glaring example of a party hung up on the kind of broad-based advertising that played well in the television age but fares poorly on social media.\n\nThe digital director of a prominent Democratic presidential campaign recounted how he was shut down by an older consultant when pressing for shorter, pithier ads that could drive clicks. \u201cWe don\u2019t need any of your cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 clickbait,\u201d the consultant snapped, according to the digital director, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid risking his job.\n\nOther digital consultants and campaign officials told similar stories, and complained that the Democratic establishment was too focused on winning over imagined moderates, instead of doing what the Trump campaign has done: firing up its base.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that anodyne messaging doesn\u2019t turn anyone off. But it doesn\u2019t turn them on either,\u201d said Elizabeth Spiers, who runs the Insurrection, a progressive digital strategy and polling firm.\n\nRepublicans are \u201cnot messaging around unity and civility, because those things don\u2019t mobilize people,\u201d Ms. Spiers said, adding that while everyone may want to live in a less divided country, \u201cnobody takes time off work, gets in their car and drives to the polls to vote specifically for that.\u201d\n\nFacebook Favors the Angry\n\nFar more than any other platform, Facebook is the focus for digital campaign spending, and it is in many ways even friendlier turf for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign than in 2016.\n\nSince then, many younger, more liberal users have abandoned the platform in favor of Instagram, Snapchat and various private messaging apps, while older users \u2014 the type most likely to vote Republican \u2014 are still flocking to Facebook in droves. People over 65 now make up Facebook\u2019s fastest-growing population in the United States, doubling their use of the platform since 2011, according to Gallup.\n\nIn a speech this year in Romania, Mr. Parscale recalled telling his team before the 2016 election that Facebook would allow the campaign to reach the \u201clost, forgotten people of America\u201d with messages tailored to their interests.\n\n\u201cMillions of Americans, older people, are on the internet, watching pictures of their kids because they all moved to cities,\u201d Mr. Parscale said. \u201cIf we can connect to them, we can change this election.\u201d\n\nFacebook also favors the kind of emotionally charged content that Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign has proved adept at creating. Campaigns buy Facebook ads through an automated auction system, with each ad receiving an \u201cengagement rate ranking\u201d based on its predicted likelihood of being clicked, shared or commented on. The divisive themes of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign tend to generate more engagement than Democrats\u2019 calmer, more policy-focused appeals. Often, the more incendiary the campaign, the further its dollars go.\n\nProvocative ads also get shared more often, creating an organic boost that vaults them even further ahead of less inflammatory messages.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an algorithmic bias that inherently benefits hate and negativity and anger,\u201d said Shomik Dutta, a digital strategist and a founder of Higher Ground Labs, an incubator for Democratic start-ups. \u201cIf anger has an algorithmic bias, then Donald Trump is the captain of that ship.\u201d\n\nA Facebook spokeswoman disputed the notion that ads got more visibility just because they were negative, and noted that users were able to flag offending ads for possible removal.\n\nThe company, since the 2016 election, has invested heavily to prevent Russian-style interference campaigns. It has built up its security and fact-checking teams, staffed a \u201cwar room\u201d during key elections and changed its rules to crack down on misinformation and false news.\n\nBut it has left a critical loophole: Facebook\u2019s fact-checking rules do not apply to political ads, letting candidates spread false or misleading claims. That has allowed Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign to show ads that traditional TV networks have declined to air.\n\nOne recent video from the Trump campaign said that Mr. Biden had offered Ukraine $1 billion in aid if it killed an investigation into a company tied to his son. The video\u2019s claims had already been debunked, and CNN refused to play it. But Facebook rejected the Biden campaign\u2019s demand to take the ad down, arguing that it did not violate its policies.\n\nAt last count, the video has been viewed on the social network more than five million times.\n\nThe 2016 Playbook\n\nIn the wake of the 2016 election, some on the left sought an explanation for Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in the idea that his campaign had used shadowy digital techniques inspired by military-style psychological warfare \u2014 a \u201cWeaponized AI Propaganda Machine,\u201d as one article described it \u2014 created by the defunct political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The theories around Cambridge Analytica have never been fully demonstrated, however, and there is a far less nefarious explanation: The Trump campaign simply made better use of standard commercial marketing tools, particularly Facebook\u2019s own high-powered targeting products.\n\nAn internal Facebook report written after the 2016 election noted that both the Trump and Clinton campaigns spent heavily on Facebook \u2014 $44 million for Mr. Trump versus $28 million for Hillary Clinton. \u201cBut Trump\u2019s FB campaigns were more complex,\u201d the memo said, and were better at using Facebook to bring in donations and find new voters. For instance, roughly 84 percent of the Trump ads focused on getting voters to take an action, such as donating, the report said. Only about half of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s did.\n\nAt the same time, the Trump campaign sought to tailor its ads more precisely to specific voters, the report said, with a typical Trump message targeted at 2.5 million people, compared with eight million for the Clinton campaign. And the Trump team simply made more unique ads \u2014 5.9 million versus 66,000.\n\n\u201cWe were making hundreds of thousands\u201d of variations on similar ads, Mr. Parscale told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d last year. \u201cChanging language, words, colors.\u201d\n\nThe idea, he said, was to find \u201cwhat is it that makes it go, \u2018Poof! I\u2019m going to stop and look.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor the left, the Trump campaign\u2019s mastery of social media in 2016 represented a sharp reversal. From the blogs of the mid-aughts to Netroots Nation, the digital activists who helped propel Barack Obama to victory in 2008 and 2012, the left was seen as the dominant digital force. The Democrats had an array of tech-savvy campaign veterans who were adept at data mining and digital organizing, and had overseen the creation of a handful of well-resourced digital consulting firms.\n\nStarting with the 2016 primaries, the Trump campaign reversed the trend. While the more traditionally minded Republican operatives signed on to work for the party\u2019s more traditional candidates, such as Jeb Bush, the Trump campaign found itself reliant on \u201cthe outliers, and a lot of them truly believed in digital,\u201d said Zac Moffatt, chief executive of Targeted Victory, a Republican digital strategy firm. \u201cIt was a changing of the guard, strategically.\u201d\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 2020 operation \u2014 with more than $150 million in cash on hand, according to the latest filings \u2014 appears to have picked up where it left off.\n\nThe Trump campaign\u2019s intense testing of ads is one example. It posts dozens of variations of almost every ad to figure which plays best. Do voters respond better to a blue button or a green one? Are they more likely to click if its says \u201cdonate\u201d or \u201ccontribute\u201d? Will they more readily cough up cash for an impeachment defense fund or an impeachment defense task force?\n\nThe president\u2019s re-election effort is also making use of strategies common in the e-commerce world, such as \u201czero touch\u201d merchandise sales. T-shirts, posters and other paraphernalia are printed on demand and sent directly to buyers, with the campaign not required to make bulk orders or risk unsold inventory. Sales of these items amount to a lucrative source of campaign fund-raising, and the zero-touch technique allows the campaign to move fast \u2014 it was able to start selling T-shirts that say \u201cget over it\u201d a day after the president\u2019s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told reporters to do just than when it came to Ukraine.\n\nPerhaps most important, the Trump campaign is spending to make sure people see its ads, emails, texts, tweets and other content. In the week the impeachment inquiry was announced, for instance, the campaign spent nearly $2.3 million on Facebook and Google ads, according to data compiled by Acronym, a progressive digital strategy organization that tracks campaign spending. That is roughly four to five times what it spent on those platforms in previous weeks, and about half of what most Democratic front-runners have spent on Facebook and Google advertising over the entire course of their campaigns.\n\nThe president\u2019s team has also invested heavily in YouTube, buying ads and counterprogramming his opponents. In June, during the first Democratic primary debates, the Trump campaign bought the YouTube \u201cmasthead\u201d \u2014 a large ad that runs at the top of the site\u2019s home page and can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per day \u2014 to ensure that debate viewers would see it.\n\nThe Trump campaign \u201cis always re-upping their ad buy. As soon as an ad runs out, another one goes in,\u201d Ms. Edelson said, adding, \u201cNo one is waiting for next month\u2019s marketing budget to kick in.\u201d\n\nGlamour Shots Only\n\nDemocrats are struggling to match more than the sheer volume of content coming out of the Trump campaign. Interviews with Democratic consultants and experts revealed a party deeply hesitant to match the Trump campaign\u2019s intense and often angry partisan approach.\n\nMost of the Democratic Party is \u201cnot even fighting last year\u2019s war \u2014 the war that they\u2019re fighting is 2012,\u201d said David Goldstein, chief executive of Tovo Labs, a progressive digital consulting firm.\n\nMr. Goldstein offered an instructive anecdote from the 2018 midterm elections. That spring, Tovo signed on to do online fund-raising for Andrew Gillum, the Democratic candidate for governor in Florida. Tovo wanted to build on the work it had done the year before in Alabama, where it claimed to have depressed Republican turnout by running ads that showcased conservatives who opposed the far-right Senate candidate Roy Moore. The ads did not say they were being run by supporters of the eventual Democratic winner, Doug Jones.\n\nMr. Goldstein hoped to bring the same edge to Mr. Gillum\u2019s campaign and came up with ads that \u201cwere really aggressive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wanted to provoke people,\u201d he said.\n\nOne was a particularly buffoonish caricature of Mr. Trump holding the world in his palm. \u201cAs Florida goes in 2018, so goes the White House in 2020,\u201d read the tagline.\n\nThe ad was aimed at far-left voters deemed most likely to be motivated by the prospect of pushing Mr. Trump from office, and the response rate was high, Mr. Goldstein said. But a few days after it went up, the campaign manager saw it and \u201cfreaked out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is entirely unacceptable,\u201d the campaign manager, Brendan McPhillips, wrote in an email on April 6, 2018.\n\nIn Mr. Goldstein\u2019s telling, the campaign manager feared offending voters whom Mr. Gillum hoped to sway. Mr. McPhillips was not mollified when Tovo explained that the ad was targeted only at voters thought to be deeply anti-Trump. He wanted ads that were focused on his candidate, not produced to elicit an emotional response with images the campaign considered crass.\n\nMr. McPhillips ordered Tovo to immediately stop running the ads. He said Tovo could only use images approved by the campaign. Tovo left soon thereafter.\n\nThe approved images \u2014 \u201cstandard glamour shots of the candidate\u201d \u2014 would work for a newspaper ad or television spot, Mr. Goldstein said, but were not \u201cgoing to drive clicks and provoke people to take action.\u201d\n\nMr. Gillum narrowly lost the race.\n\nFollow Matthew Rosenberg on Twitter at @AllMattNYT, and Kevin Roose at @kevinroose.", "description": "On any given day, the Trump campaign is plastering ads all over Facebook, YouTube and the millions of sites served by Google, hitting the kind of incendiary themes \u2014 immigrant invaders, the corrupt media \u2014 that play best on platforms where algorithms favor outrage and political campaigns are free to disregard facts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAJ40Cx.img?h=169&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=474&y=166", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
