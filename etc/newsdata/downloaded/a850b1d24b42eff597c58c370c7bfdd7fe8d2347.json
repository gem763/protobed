For many, the line between a stable life and a fragile one is thinning.\n\nExamine the typical American family\u2019s monthly budget, line by line, and a larger story emerges about how the middle class has evolved.\n\nWhat it means to be middle class hasn\u2019t changed much \u2014 there\u2019s a steady job, the ability to comfortably raise a family if you choose to, a home to call your own, an annual vacation. But what it takes to achieve all that has become more challenging.\n\nThe costs of housing, health care and education are consuming ever larger shares of household budgets, and have risen faster than incomes. Today\u2019s middle-class families are working longer, managing new kinds of stress and shouldering greater financial risks than previous generations did. They\u2019re also making different kinds of tradeoffs.\n\nMost people believe that they belong somewhere in the middle class, but its boundaries and markers of it are subject to interpretation.\n\nBased on income alone, about half of all adults in the United States fall in this category, according to a 2018 report from the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan research group. It defined being middle class as having an annual household income from about two-thirds to double the national median, which translates to roughly $48,000 to $145,000 for a family of three (in 2018 dollars).\n\nFour families, from Sheboygan, Wis., to San Francisco, gave us a glimpse at their monthly budgets. Their stories help illustrate how a middle-class existence has fundamentally shifted over a generation.\n\n\u2018Such High Levels of Stress\u2019\n\nLauren and Trevor Koch Lauren is in retail sales, and Trevor is a chef.

Mr. Koch, a chef earning $51,000, often worked 50 hours or more a week. Ms. Koch decided to give up her job as a restaurant server after the couple had the first of their two children. Given the high cost of child care, she felt her time was better spent at home.\n\nLife got trickier when Mr. Koch lost his job as a chef at the end of February. Now he cares for the children in the morning, while Ms. Koch works part time at a shop that sells CBD, or cannabidiol, products. When she gets home at 1 p.m., he leaves for his job as a line cook, where he is paid hourly and works until 11 p.m. Neither of them receives paid time off or health insurance.\n\n\u201cWe have such high levels of stress from juggling our schedules,\u201d Ms. Koch said. Collectively, they earn slightly more than before, she said, but it\u2019s unclear if their hours will dwindle during the winter months.\n\nAs family incomes have become more volatile, academic experts said, the trend has contributed to greater feelings of financial insecurity. For many people who experience a drop in income, whatever the reason, the declines tend to be greater than in the past, according to an analysis by Jacob Hacker, the director of Yale University\u2019s Institution for Social and Policy Studies.\n\nThe share of Americans who experience income loss tends to rise and fall with the economy. But the share of Americans experiencing larger losses has increased.

Employers and government institutions keep shifting responsibility to workers, forcing them to navigate more threats to their financial well-being. Pensions have been largely replaced by 401(k) plans. Comprehensive health coverage has given way to high-deductible plans. Paid family leave is uncommon.\n\nSo families make tradeoffs. Even when Mr. Koch had a salaried job with benefits as a chef, he and his wife couldn\u2019t afford to save for retirement. Their biggest expenses were rent, food and debt payments, and they were just scraping by. At $80 a month, their health care premiums seemed reasonable, until they needed a doctor: Both had deductibles of $3,000.\n\nSuch a fragile existence is threatened even further when major investments meant to cement a middle-class life \u2014 getting a college degree, buying a home \u2014 backfire. Mr. and Ms. Koch both have more than $70,000 in loan debt for college educations they never completed, meaning a good chunk of their money is effectively gone every month before they have spent anything at all.\n\nIf their finances were stronger, Ms. Koch said, they would seek help handling life\u2019s stresses and complexities. \u201cTherapy is probably the first thing we would add into our lives,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2018We Are in Survival Mode\u2019\n\nMelanie Espinosa and Brett Townsend Melanie is a procurement specialist, and Brett is an internet sales manager at a car dealership.

He rouses and dresses their two toddler daughters about 15 minutes later and gets them a snack. They buckle the girls into their carseats by 8 and head to preschool. They\u2019ll have breakfast there.\n\nMs. Espinosa, a purchasing specialist at a transit technology company, and Mr. Townsend, an internet sales manager at a car dealership, together earn about $90,000 a year. And yet their income never seems to go as far as they need it to.\n\nMs. Espinosa said they would like to save for a down payment on a home and for the girls\u2019 college educations. But that isn\u2019t possible right now.\n\n\u201cWe are in survival mode,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can mostly break even.\u201d\n\nEven with two paychecks, middle-class status has become more elusive. The soaring costs of those three big-ticket items \u2014 housing, health care and college \u2014 have made it more difficult for some people to achieve certain milestones.\n\nThe struggle is not unique to the United States. In April, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reported that pressures on the middle class around the world have increased since the 1980s. What sets middle-class Americans apart, the study found, is that they are struggling under several burdens \u2014 low income growth, rising costs, declining job security \u2014 while those in many other countries face just one or two.\n\nSpending patterns have also shifted drastically over the past century. American households spend significantly more of their budgets on housing and less on items like food than they did in previous decades.\n\nHousing accounted for 23 percent of the average household\u2019s total expenditures in 1901, 27 percent in 1950, and nearly 33 percent in 2018, according to data from the United States Consumer Expenditure Survey. Those squarely in the middle of the income distribution spent slightly more, or 34.5 percent. (The data doesn\u2019t account for homes today being larger and having more amenities.)\n\nRising Costs Outpace Income Growth 180 % Education costs 160 U.S. nominal prices and income, 1995 = 100% Housing costs 140 Health care costs 120 Median income 100 \u201995 \u201900 \u201905 \u201910 \u201915 \u201917 Rising Costs Outpace Income Growth 180 % Education costs 160 U.S. nominal prices and income, 1995 = 100% Housing costs 140 Health care costs 120 Median income 100 \u201995 \u201900 \u201905 \u201910 \u201915 \u201917 Rising Costs Outpace Income Growth 180 % Education costs 160 U.S. nominal prices and income, 1995 = 100% Housing costs 140 Health care costs 120 Median income 100 \u201995 \u201900 \u201905 \u201910 \u201915 \u201917 Notes: Median income is used as a proxy for the middle class.

Michael F\u00f6rster, a senior policy analyst at the O.E.C.D.\u2019s jobs and income division.\n\n\u201cYoung families with kids are really getting slammed on all sides,\u201d said Jenny Schuetz, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies housing policy. \u201cThey are more likely to have some student debt, and child care has gotten more expensive. So if you are trying to pay off student debt, pay for child care and rent, it will be tough to save for a down payment.\u201d\n\nChild care is a substantial expense for Ms. Espinosa and Mr. Townsend \u2014 and it just swelled. They were paying about $800 a month, a relative bargain because they relied on someone who watched children in her home. But they had to find a replacement quickly when their caregiver stopped working recently. Two spots at a Montessori school were available, but they\u2019re now paying $1,200 for that \u2014 nearly as much as their rent.\n\nThe girls are thriving, Ms. Espinosa said, but the extra cost will probably push the prospect of owning a home further into the future.\n\nThe couple\u2019s only debt is from Ms. Espinosa\u2019s student loans, now just under $16,000, and car payments on their six- and 11-year-old Hondas.\n\nMs. Espinosa said she had always thought being middle class meant living a humble life, without having to constantly worry about which bills were coming up.\n\n\u201cWe have a good income for where we are,\u201d she added. \u201cBut for some reason every single month it seems like, \u2018Oh, something came up or we didn\u2019t make enough.\u2019 It\u2019s just a constant battle.\u201d\n\n\u2018If It Had Not Been for Women\u2019\n\nAmanda Rodriguez and David Allen Amanda managed a health care intervention program at a hospital, and David is a director at a charter school.

But in San Francisco, where they live, it\u2019s considered middle class, according to Pew\u2019s calculations.\n\nThe couple welcomed a baby girl in May, meaning their income will have to stretch even further: They will likely spend roughly two-thirds of their take-home pay on child care and rent on their two-bedroom apartment. For now, they\u2019re managing on less money.\n\nMs. Rodriguez, who has been on maternity leave, had planned to return to her job \u2014 managing a program that trained medical providers to help victims of violence \u2014 in mid-September. But little more than two weeks before her scheduled return, she learned she no longer had a position to return to \u2014 federal funding had been slashed, eliminating the program.\n\nSo her leave from the work force has effectively been extended \u2014 she plans to look for another job in public health in the coming months.\n\nThe shape of the American family is in a steady state of flux, but two-earner households are the norm now. In perhaps one of the biggest shifts of the past 50 years, married mothers entered the work force in ever-greater numbers in a wave that peaked in the 1990s before leveling off and retreating slightly. Women, in general, followed a similar pattern.\n\nBut for many families, the addition of women\u2019s earnings has simply helped maintain their position or kept household income from dropping, according to an analysis by Heather Boushey, the president and chief executive officer of the nonprofit Washington Center for Equitable Growth.\n\nFrom 1979 to 2018, middle-income families\u2019 incomes rose 23.1 percent, adjusted for inflation, according to the study. Professional families\u2019 incomes, by contrast, rose 68.3 percent. Over the same 39 years, the average American woman experienced a 21 percent increase in annual working hours, according to Ms. Boushey\u2019s analysis.\n\nMost of the earnings gains among families in the period Ms. Boushey studied can be traced directly to working women. They accounted for three-quarters of the rise in income among middle-class families in that time. Among professional families, women\u2019s earnings were the most important factor, but men\u2019s incomes rose, too.\n\n\u201cMany families would have seen their income drop precipitously over the past few decades if it had not been for women going to work,\u201d Ms. Boushey said.\n\nWomen are working more hours . . . 1,720 Professional 1,460 Middle class 1,330 1,180 Annual hours worked by women 760 Low income 630 1979 2018 . . . and account for most income growth. +$100,000 Other sources Change in household income, 1979 to 2018 +$80,000 Men\u2019s earnings +60,000 +40,000 MORE PAY Women\u2019s earnings +20,000 MORE HOURS 0 Low- income Middle- class Professional \u201320,000 Women are working more hours . . . 1,720 Professional 1,460 Middle class 1,330 1,180 Annual hours worked by women 760 Low income 630 1979 2018 . . . and account for most income growth. +$100,000 Other sources Change in household income, 1979 to 2018 +$80,000 Men\u2019s earnings +60,000 +40,000 MORE PAY Women\u2019s earnings +20,000 MORE HOURS 0 Low- income Middle- class Professional \u201320,000 Women are working more hours . . . . . . and account for most income growth. +$100,000 Earnings from other sources 1,720 Professional +$80,000 Change in household income, 1979 to 2018 Men\u2019s earnings 1,460 Middle class +60,000 1,330 1,180 Annual hours worked by women +40,000 MORE PAY Women\u2019s earnings 760 Low income +20,000 630 MORE HOURS MORE HOURS 0 Low income Middle class Professional \u201320,000 1979 2018 Low-income households: those in the bottom third of the income distribution, or earning less than $26,080 annually in 2018 dollars; Professional families have income in the top 20 percent, or roughly $71,913 or higher, with at least one member holding a college degree or higher.

Ms. Rodriguez wasn\u2019t comfortable with leaving her infant in a big day care, so she and Mr. Allen will most likely pay a little more to share a nanny with another family.\n\nThat means they will be forced to set aside significantly less for retirement, eliminate trips to the chiropractor and cut back on weekend jaunts out of town. Saving for a down payment on a home isn\u2019t a priority because they don\u2019t have any aspirations of ever owning in high-cost San Francisco.\n\n\u201cWe will rearrange things,\u201d Ms. Rodriguez said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very expensive city, and we are actively making a choice to be here.\u201d\n\n\u2018We Have Been Incredibly Lucky\u2019\n\nMike and Lindsay Schluckebier Mike is a college academic adviser, and Lindsay is a K-12 public school curriculum coordinator.

That has allowed their collective net worth to grow far more, even if they feel pinched by rising costs.\n\n\u201cA good proxy for points at which we can be pretty sure people are in a strong financial position is if their income is congealing into wealth,\u201d said Richard Reeves, director of the Future of the Middle Class Initiative at the Brookings Institution and the author of \u201cDream Hoarders: How the American Upper Middle Class Is Leaving Everyone Else in the Dust.\u201d \u201cIt is not what is coming in, but what is staying in.\u201d\n\nThere is no magic formula for creating that congealing effect, but achieving it often involves several factors, including a bit of luck and a bit of help.\n\nShare of all U.S. income Share of all U.S. wealth Grouped by income Upper- middle class Middle class 51% 48% 46% Upper- middle class 40% 35% 34% Top 1% 32% 29% 24% 21% Middle class Top 1% 13% 8% 8% 7% Lowest 20% Lowest 20% 4% 2% 1979 2016 1995 2016 Share of all U.S. income Share of all U.S. wealth Grouped by income Middle class Upper- middle class 51% 48% 46% Upper- middle class 40% 35% 34% Top 1 percent 32% 29% 24% 21% Middle class Top 1 percent 13% 8% Lowest 20 percent 8% 7% Lowest 20 percent 4% 2% 1979 2016 1995 2016 Share of all U.S. income Share of all U.S. wealth Grouped by income Upper- middle class Middle class 51% 48% 46% Upper- middle class 40% 35% 34% Top 1 percent 32% 29% 24% 21% Middle class Top 1 percent 13% 8% 8% Lowest 20 percent 7% Lowest 20 percent 4% 2% 1979 2016 1995 2016 SHARE OF INCOME: Income after accounting for federal taxes; social insurance benefits like Social Security, Medicare, unemployment insurance; and mean-tested benefits like Medicaid and food stamps. SHARE OF WEALTH: Income groups are measured by usual income, which is designed to capture income without economic fluctuations. Does not count value of Social Security benefits or defined benefit plans; also excludes Forbes 400, so likely underestimates wealth held by top 1 percent. \u00b7 Source: Brookings Institution (using data from the Congressional Budget Office and the Federal Reserve\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finance)\n\nA few factors helped shape the Schluckebiers\u2019 circumstances. They made deliberate financial decisions that have worked out well: Both kept the cost of college down by working on campus as resident assistants. They also worked full time during graduate school \u2014 Mr. Schluckebier was a residence hall director, so they had free housing \u2014 and eventually saved $16,000 for a down payment on a house.\n\nOnce they were ready to buy, they didn\u2019t reach for a more spacious house in the parts of town where two-car garages are the norm. They chose a modest, 1,500-square-foot ranch, then dedicated an extra $800 a month to paying off the principal on their mortgage while making healthy contributions to their retirement accounts. That may be easier to do in a relatively low-cost locale with healthy job opportunities like Iowa City than in a big city on one of the coasts.\n\nTiming also helped. They were ready to buy a home in 2008, as prices were trending lower. They also have the good fortune of having what Mr. Schluckebier calls \u201cspectacular\u201d retirement and health benefits at work. His employer contributes 10 percent of his salary to his retirement account.\n\nThe couple\u2019s student debt, now paid off, was manageable, in part because their parents contributed to their tuition payments.\n\nBut they worry about whether they will be able to contribute enough toward their own children\u2019s college expenses, given what college might cost 10 years from now. More broadly, they are concerned about the state of the country, and how other Americans are faring.\n\n\u201cWe have been incredibly lucky,\u201d Mr. Schluckebier said, \u201cwhich is why I don\u2019t necessarily worry about us as much as I worry about the macro picture across the country.\u201d", "description": "Most Americans think of themselves as middle class.
