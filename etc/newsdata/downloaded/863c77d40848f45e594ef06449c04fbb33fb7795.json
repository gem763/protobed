For the second straight year, the A\u2019s have found their way into the postseason.\n\n\u201cIt feels amazing. It feels like this is becoming a habit. It\u2019s a good thing,\u201d drenched outfielder Mark Canha said.\n\nOakland wrapped up a playoff spot before first pitch, but missed a chance to move closer to hosting next week\u2019s wild-card game when closer Liam Hendriks gave up two runs in the ninth inning of a 4-3 loss to the Seattle Mariners on Friday night.\n\nOakland is tied with Tampa Bay for the two wild-card spots at 96-64. Oakland holds the tiebreaker if the teams wind up even, meaning the A\u2019s would host the Rays on Wednesday night.\n\nOakland sealed its postseason berth when Cleveland lost to Washington. Many of the A\u2019s exchanged a brief set of hugs and high fives in the dugout after the Indians loss went final.\n\nThe real party was still to come, even if it came after a loss. And for the second straight year, the party took place in Seattle, home of the team with the longest playoff drought in baseball.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty much why we play the game is to get an opportunity to play in the postseason,\u201d Oakland starting pitcher Mike Fiers said. \u201cObviously we set our goals to win the division, that didn\u2019t happen, but as long as we\u2019re in we have an opportunity to make some noise. We can\u2019t ask for anything more than that.\u201d\n\nSeattle put a damper on some of Oakland\u2019s party by scoring twice with two outs in the ninth. Shed Long\u2019s RBI single scored Mallex Smith with the tying run and J.P. Crawford followed with an RBI double to win it for the Mariners.\n\nHendriks (4-4) blew his seventh save of the season. Seattle tied the game at 3 on Long\u2019s two-strike single up the middle. Smith singled with one out, moved up on a pair of wild pitches and jogged home on Long\u2019s hit.\n\nCrawford followed going the opposite way down the left-field line and Long used his speed to score from first.\n\n\u201cOur guys have a lot to play for too, trying to prove themselves. \u2026 It\u2019s nice for those guys to get the results like that,\u201d Seattle manager Scott Servais said.\n\nIt\u2019s the second straight year and third time since 2014 the A\u2019s have earned a wild-card berth. Last year the A\u2019s lost 7-2 to the New York Yankees in the wild-card game, and they fell to Kansas City in 2014.\n\nTwo years ago, the A\u2019s won 75 games. Last year, they won 97 games. With two more wins this weekend, they would finish with 98 victories.\n\n\u201cThis group\u2019s establishing themselves as one of the better teams in the American League, and any time you win as many games as we have it means you had another successful season,\u201d Oakland manager Bob Melvin said. \u201cThese guys are still hungry.\u201d\n\nMatt Olson appeared to make it celebratory night for the A\u2019s with a two-run home run off Taylor Guilbeau in the seventh inning to give Oakland a 3-2 lead. It was his 36th home run of the season and brought raucous cheers from the small smattering of fans in green around the ballpark.\n\nBut Hendriks ran into trouble in the ninth. He had allowed just two earned runs in the past 10 appearances.\n\nMarcus Semien led off the game with his 33rd home run on the fourth pitch from Justus Sheffield. Seattle took a 2-1 lead in the third inning after Austin Nola\u2019s RBI single. It was the Mariners\u2018 first lead since the first inning of last Sunday\u2019s 2-1 loss to Baltimore, a span of 37 innings since Seattle was last in front.\n\nArt Warren (1-0) pitched the ninth to get the victory.\n\nSTARTING OFF\n\nFiers got through five innings, but wasn\u2019t at his best. He allowed two runs and four hits and struck out four. It wasn\u2019t as good as his last start when he pitched eight shutout innings against Texas, but was better than the two prior starts against the Astros and Rangers where he allowed 12 earned runs in 2 2/3 combined innings.\n\nSheffield labored through five innings in the final start of his first season with the organization, but limited the A\u2019s to only Semien\u2019s homer. Sheffield allowed five hits and walked four, and stranded baserunners at third in the second, fourth and fifth innings.\n\n\u201cHe was really amped up in the first \u2026 and we needed him to calm down. And he did. He started to get into his flow and his pitches,\u201d Servais said.\n\nHOMER NOTES\n\nSemien\u2019s home run moved him into the lead among shortstops in the AL. Semien has one more than Boston\u2019s Xander Bogaerts and two ahead of Cleveland\u2019s Francisco Lindor. \u2026 Olson leads all AL first basemen with his 36 homers.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nMelvin is hoping for a chance to work OF Stephen Piscotty into the lineup over the weekend after he missed a month with an ankle injury.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAthletics: Brett Anderson (12-9, 4.00) is 8-3 with a 3.40 ERA in 15 road starts this season. It will be his 31st start of the season, tying a career-high.\n\nMariners: Marco Gonzales (16-12, 4.09) looks to put a capper on a season that\u2019s already seen career highs in wins and starts.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Even in the aftermath of a loss that could end up costing them in the race to host the AL wild-card game, the party raged on in the Oakland Athletics clubhouse.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tim Booth"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/28/athletics_mariners_baseball_75779_c0-155-3710-2318_s1770x1032.jpg?175ae27d8ab1ce1278d45ce0c2bee8a54d616425", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
