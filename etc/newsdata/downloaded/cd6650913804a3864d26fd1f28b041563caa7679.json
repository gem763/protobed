Many sun creams today contain ingredients which are toxic to wildlife and humans, and can cause the bleaching of corals.", "description": "The end of reapplying sunscreen could be on the horizon after scientists found a molecule which can \u2018dance\u2019 away the harmful sunlight.", "authors": ["Sarah Knapton", "Science Editor"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/science/2016/06/30/sun-cream_2912502b-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpJliwavx4coWFCaEkEsb3kvxIt-lGGWCWqwLa_RXJU8.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
