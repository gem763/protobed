REUTERS/Kyle Grillot/File Photo\n\nFederal investigators have interviewed here the only survivors from the fire aboard the Conception, the captain and four crew members, as well as Glen Fritzler, whose Truth Aquatics Inc owns and operates the vessel.\n\nWhile no one has sued yet, wrongful death lawsuits by families of the victims were a near certainty, legal experts said.\n\nAccidents that occur on land with a similar death toll could lead to more than $100 million in damages, lawyers said.\n\nBut on the water, maritime law applies, and any lawsuits will run up against a statute that allows the owner of a vessel and its insurer to escape or severely limit its liability in certain cases.\n\nExperts in maritime law said Truth Aquatics will almost certainly file a petition under the Shipowner\u2019s Limitation of Liability Act of 1851. The law is routinely invoked for an accident on a waterway, whether it involves tug boats and barges in busy harbors or leisure boats at vacation hotspots.\n\nTruth Aquatics declined to comment.\n\nThe law allows the owner of a vessel to petition a federal court to exonerate it from damages, or limit damages to the post-accident value of the ship, which would be zero in the case of the sunken Conception. An owner has roughly six months to file a petition and can do it before or after it is sued.\n\n\u201cIt really is antithetical to most fair-minded people and jurists to allow this old defense to potentially let someone off scot free,\u201d said Daniel Rose, an attorney with the Kreindler & Kreindler firm which represents victims in maritime accidents.\n\nThe 1912 sinking of the Titanic on its maiden voyage, in which more than 1,500 people were killed, is a classic example of the law being successfully employed.\n\nThe ship\u2019s owner, White Star Lines, was able to limit its liability in lawsuits in the United States to $92,000, which was the value of the lifeboats that survived the accident.\n\nThe act requires an owner to show its actions did not cause the accident, or as 19th Century maritime law put it, that the owner lacked \u201cprivity or knowledge\u201d of the incident. Owners rely on evidence that their ship was properly equipped, the crew well-trained and procedures were being followed.\n\nIn the case of the Titanic, the ship was state-of-the-art and deemed unsinkable, and White Star Lines played no part in the captain\u2019s navigation into an iceberg.\n\nCircumstances have changed with modern communications, increasing the owner\u2019s role in a ship\u2019s operation and decreasing the owner\u2019s ability to limit liability under the act.\n\n\u201cThese days a master won\u2019t scratch himself without asking the owner\u2019s permission,\u201d said Martin Davies, who teaches admiralty law at Tulane Law School.\n\nIn the case of the Conception, a judge would look for evidence that showed the owner had \u201cknowledge,\u201d or some involvement in the accident. The captain and four crew were on deck when the flames erupted early Monday morning and were able to escape in an inflatable life boat, investigators said. One crew member was sleeping below deck with the passengers.\n\n\u201cI think court would look to the competency of the crew, their background, education, what was put on board for firefighting equipment, what training the crew had, what training the passengers had,\u201d said Michael Karcher, a maritime law specialist with Karcher, Canning & Karcher in Dania Beach, Florida.\n\nThe owner will try to pin blame solely on the crew and try to show the accident cannot be linked to something the owner did or should have done, legal experts said.\n\nThe Truth Aquatics fleet is moored in Santa Barbara, California, and the Conception was on a three-day excursion to the Santa Cruz Islands.\n\nJudges have been reluctant to apply the law outside purely maritime accidents, especially in high-profile accidents involving tourists, lawyers said.\n\n\u201cThe courts are generally not in favor of it,\u201d said Karcher. \u201cIt\u2019s a fairly high threshold.\u201d\n\nThe act was invoked in last year\u2019s duck boat accident near Branson, Missouri, which killed 17 people. Even though the judge has yet to rule on the petition to limit liability, many of the victims\u2019 claims have settled.\n\nKreindler attorney Rose said it was not unusual for an owner to try to strike settlements in headline-grabbing cases.\n\n\u201cIn a case with egregious facts you don\u2019t want to push too far because they risk raising the ire of the public and people in Congress who maybe take a look at the law anew,\u201d Rose said.", "description": "The company that owns a scuba dive boat that caught fire and sank off California killing 34 people, may seek to limit its liability by invoking a 19th Century law that has shielded vessel owners from costly disasters such as the sinking of the Titanic.", "authors": ["Tom Hals", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426886863&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF850YU", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
