Photo: New York Magazine\n\nHistory books will record Donald Trump as the first president of the United States to assume office without any previous experience in government. This is not a mere biographical detail but a skeleton key for understanding his methods of wielding power. Trump has never recognized any distinction between his public and private life. Extraordinarily, he didn\u2019t divest from his businesses even while serving as president. Even worse, he treated the government as if it were his property. The Ukraine scandal is another case of Trump treating the executive branch as though it had been acquired by the Trump Organization. It may or may not be the worst of his many offenses, but it would be perfectly fitting if, as now seems possible, it is ultimately the instrument of his demise.\n\nThe scandal revolves around Trump turning American foreign policy toward Ukraine into an extortion scheme for his political benefit. The plot began as early as this spring and at first was mostly conducted in broad daylight. Trump deputized his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to undertake this mission.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s original goal was to prod Ukraine to turn over evidence that would exonerate Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign manager. Manafort had worked in Ukraine for a pro-Russian party, then gone on to manage Trump\u2019s campaign while maintaining secret contacts with a Russian intelligence officer, and he was helping Trump in 2018 by withholding cooperation from special counsel Robert Mueller. Giuliani was attempting to prove that Manafort had been set up by Ukrainians working with the Clinton campaign and that \u2014 even more bizarrely \u2014 Ukrainians had stolen Clinton\u2019s emails.\n\nIf these theories sound fantastical, they are. But just as Watergate demystified the White House staff as bumblers, the Ukraine scandal has revealed Trump and his allies are suffering from Fox News poisoning. The bizarre conspiracy theories that the rest of us took to be devious propaganda had a profound impact on the president and his inner circle. They are not-very-bright guys who also happen to be genuinely nuts.\n\nBut the mission followed a coherent strategic goal. Trump thrives on cynicism, excusing his misconduct with the assumption everybody does it \u2014 simultaneously condoning his own failings while dragging his antagonists down to his level. His election required many Americans to believe his opponent had engaged in criminal behavior. He has instinctively replicated those conditions in his quasi-campaign against Mueller as well as against the Democrats in 2020.\n\nIn the course of his work, Giuliani made contact with Ukrainian prosecutors and hit upon yet another conspiracy theory. The story held that, during the Obama administration, Joe Biden had called for the firing of a prosecutor who was on the tail of a Ukrainian firm that had hired his son Hunter. This theory, too, was wrong. Hunter Biden had gone to work for a Ukrainian energy firm as part of a generally sleazy practice of trading on his father\u2019s name. And it was true that Joe Biden spearheaded demands to fire a prosecutor. But the prosecutor was not investigating Hunter Biden\u2019s firm at that time. And the vice-president\u2019s call to fire the prosecutor, who was notoriously ineffectual at rooting out corruption, placed him squarely on the side of human-rights activists, democratic countries, the IMF, the World Bank, and other international do-gooders.\n\nPresident Trump began to focus on the twin goals of pressuring Ukraine\u2019s government to investigate his antagonists from the 2016 election and the leading contender to face him in the next one. He had the benefit of leverage: Ukraine was under military attack from Russia, which had seized a chunk of its territory five years before and was beginning a new offensive. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s new president (and, like Trump, a straight-from-television political novice), desperately needed aid from the U.S. to fend off the invasion as well as a meeting with Trump to underscore Trump\u2019s commitment and to discourage Russia from expanding its attacks.\n\nGiuliani spearheaded the effort, holding numerous meetings with Ukrainians to demand the investigations. Far from disguising his role, Giuliani went out of his way to advertise it. \u201cWe\u2019re meddling in an investigation \u2026 because that information will be very, very helpful to my client,\u201d he boasted to the New York Times in May. The intended audience for his confession was likely Zelensky. The Ukrainian president, after all, needed to understand that this intermittently coherent cable-news shouting head, who did not hold a government job of any kind, did in fact speak on behalf of the world\u2019s most powerful person.\n\nIn an April phone call, Trump urged Zelensky to coordinate with Giuliani. Zelensky dragged his feet, causing Trump to increase the pressure. According to the complaint of a CIA officer detailed to the White House, Trump ordered Vice-President Pence not to attend Zelensky\u2019s inauguration (a snub celebrated by Russian television). Trump held up the military aid and withheld the cherished meeting, while Giuliani continued demanding the investigations. Trump reiterated the demands in a second call in July, in which the two presidents danced around each other while making their respective asks perfectly clear.\n\nIn recent days, Trump denied ever having made an explicit quid pro quo. \u201cI did not make a statement that \u2018you have to do this or I\u2019m not going to give you aid,\u2019 \u201d he told reporters. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d This is probably true. As Trump\u2019s former fixer Michael Cohen testified, he \u201cspeaks in a code.\u201d Trump makes it clear that he views relationships as transactional and lets counterparties know what he wants from them. Trump phrased his demands as rooting out \u201ccorruption\u201d (i.e., \u201cWe\u2019re giving a lot of money away to Ukraine and other places. You want to see a country that\u2019s going to be not corrupt\u201d), but nobody mistook him as a wide-eyed advocate of good government.\n\nTrump\u2019s salad days as a young builder working Mob contacts and crooked politicians left him with the belief that greasing palms is how business gets done. He has imported that style to the presidency, letting it be known that putting money in his pocket is the entry price to secure his favor.\n\n(In their phone call, Zelensky mentions that he had stayed in one of Trump\u2019s New York properties.) He has cozied up to a rogues\u2019 gallery of the world\u2019s most corrupt states (including Russia and the Gulf kingdoms). Trump believes in corruption at an almost ideological level. He is not only corrupt but a corruptionist.\n\nBoth Ukrainians and American officials, the Times reported, understood his talking about the term \u201cas code\u201d \u2014 there\u2019s the word Cohen used again \u2014 \u201cfor the Bidens and Ukrainians who released damaging information about the Trump campaign in 2016.\u201d Trump has even translated the code himself. Asked by a reporter if he \u201craised Joe Biden or his son\u2019s name with Ukraine,\u201d the president replied, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t even want to mention it, but certainly I\u2019d have every right to. I\u2019d have every right to. If there\u2019s corruption, and we\u2019re paying lots of money to a country, we don\u2019t want a country we\u2019re giving massive aid to to be corrupting our system, and we don\u2019t want it to be corrupt in any way.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainians \u201cexpressed concern to U.S. senators that the aid had been held up as a penalty for resisting that pressure\u201d to investigate Biden, reported The Wall Street Journal. In an early-September press conference, a reporter asked Pence if the aid was being held up over Ukraine\u2019s failure to open the investigations requested by Giuliani. Pence did not deny it. Instead, he reiterated the threat in the familiar code. After insisting that the U.S. stands behind Ukraine, he warned, \u201cBut as President Trump had me make clear, we have great concerns about issues of corruption.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s diplomatic interactions have prioritized using foreign leaders to solicit endorsements. He regularly boasts that world leaders praise him and mock his enemies behind closed doors. Trump told reporters in May, \u201cKim Jong-un made a statement that Joe Biden is a low-IQ individual,\u201d as if Americans should trust the assessment of a possibly insane dictator. His efforts with Ukraine took that tendency to an extreme, pushing for a formal investigation that he could brandish as evidence of guilt.\n\nTrouble is, American foreign policy is not designed to jack up other countries to supply dirt on the president\u2019s enemies. Trump had to jury-rig the system to run it through a non-diplomat without security clearance or even a government job, who represented not the U.S. government but Trump personally. And when American diplomats and members of Congress raised concerns, he engaged in a cover-up that recruited numerous officials, some of them high ranking, into the plot.\n\nPence and Mick Mulvaney, Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff and budget director, were tasked with disseminating cover stories to explain the holdup with aid. (Pence, for one, almost certainly knew the real story.) White House officials hid the records of Trump\u2019s phone calls with Zelensky on a classified system, fearing they contained incriminating evidence of Trump using the Ukrainian leader for domestic political gain. When the CIA operative filed an official complaint about the scheme, the Inspector General for the Intelligence Community deemed it credible, but the acting director of national intelligence didn\u2019t send it to Congress, and the Department of Justice quashed a referral for a criminal investigation. Attorney General William Barr did not recuse himself, even though Barr himself is implicated. (On the second Zelensky call, Trump promises to put Barr on the Biden case, reflecting once again his faith in his AG\u2019s subservience and total lack of professional ethics.)\n\nTrump\u2019s Ukraine policy was at best illegitimate and at worst illegal, so there was no way to operate it through normal channels. The cover-up rippled through the bureaucracy. Trump\u2019s accomplices have already begun fingering each other. Giuliani waved around his phone on a Fox News segment, claiming it contained messages authorizing his actions from the State Department \u2014 which, if true, may implicate Mike Pompeo, who was just subpoenaed by three House committees. \u201cI\u2019m the real whistle-blower,\u201d he later warned his co-conspirators. \u201cIf I get killed now, you won\u2019t get the rest of the story.\u201d Trump told reporters, \u201cI think you should ask for Vice-President Pence\u2019s conversations, because he had a couple conversations also,\u201d a helpful reminder that if Trump goes down, his subordinate might, too.\n\nThe most committed of Trump\u2019s defenders have insisted that he is the victim of smears or the usual litany of Fake News, radical socialists, and their allies in the intelligence community. A somewhat more sophisticated defense has emerged, predicated on the absence of an explicit statement by Trump that he would grant the aid and the meeting in return for the investigations. They are circulating the same pointillistic defenses of his statements and actions they used during the Russia scandal, analyzing each statement in isolation and in the most favorable light, ignoring the unmistakable context. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial page insists that in the second phone call, Zelensky brings up Giuliani and his investigative demands before Trump mentions them, as if Zelensky had thought up the idea of investigating Biden himself, rather than having faced months of pressure to do it.\n\nWhat almost none of the Republicans have dared offer is a positive defense of his actions. Their shyness reflects a surprising consensus that withholding military aid to force Ukraine to investigate Biden \u2014 i.e., exactly what Trump did \u2014 is deeply improper. A September 24 YouGov poll asked: If Trump \u201csuspended military aid to Ukraine in order to incentivize the country\u2019s officials to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden,\u201d is impeachment warranted? Fifty-five percent supported impeachment, with only 26 percent opposed. No wonder Trump\u2019s defenders have concluded their only viable defense is to dispute the factual premise.\n\nThe public remains divided on impeachment, reflecting the fact that the scandal remains unfamiliar to many. Democrats must prove their case to the public, but if they do, they have a path to a solid majority. They have weeks of hearings to drive home the known facts and produce additional evidence. The cynical and historically correct assumption is that Republicans will rally around the president who boasted he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue without losing any support.\n\nYet there is at least some reason to suspect this episode might play differently. The customary phalanx of Republicans has failed to materialize. \u201cI want to say to the president, \u2018This is not okay,\u2019 \u201d scolded Ohio Republican Mike Turner. \u201cI think it\u2019s disappointing to the American public when they read the transcript.\u201d Mitt Romney said he was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by Trump\u2019s behavior. Ben Sasse, who has curried Trump\u2019s favor, said his party \u201cought not just circle the wagons.\u201d Dozens of Republicans either refused to comment or said they needed more information.\n\nMost of the holdouts will hop back on the Trump train eventually. But their lack of vocal support creates a favorable asymmetry for Democrats as the impeachment process begins. Democrats are unanimous in their condemnation of Trump\u2019s behavior, while Republicans are divided, giving Democrats an opportunity to split wide open the crack in the Republican wall. The appearance of more evidence against Trump might conceivably cause them to defect. It is, at least, no longer unimaginable.\n\nTrump responded to the threat of impeachment by reaffirming why he deserves it. He told reporters that impeachment (a mechanism in the Constitution) \u201cshouldn\u2019t be allowed. There should be a way of stopping it.\n\nMaybe legally through the courts.\u201d And he told a private audience that the media reporting the story were \u201canimals\u201d and \u201cscum\u201d and said the CIA officer who filed the complaint (through approved legal channels) committed \u201ctreason\u201d and implied that he should be executed. L\u2019\u00e9tat, c\u2019est Trump, as always.\n\nPart of Trump\u2019s rage stemmed from what appeared to be genuine surprise that the record of him pressuring Zelensky failed to win the approbation he expected. Hadn\u2019t Zelensky flattered him and noted his great electoral victory? Didn\u2019t his counterpart meekly submit to Trump\u2019s demands? How could this be received as anything other than the \u201cperfect\u201d conversation Trump had promised it would be?\n\nRepresentative Mark Meadows, one of Trump\u2019s more slavish followers, observed in the president\u2019s defense, \u201cHe didn\u2019t see anything wrong with the conversation he had with a foreign leader.\u201d That is probably accurate. Trump has a finely honed antenna for assessing winner versus loser, or loyal versus disloyal. But the formulation of moral concepts is not a function he can perform. His brain is no more capable of distinguishing right from wrong than your microwave oven can tell you what\u2019s on Netflix. No American president has more richly deserved impeachment.\n\n*This article appears in the September 30, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
