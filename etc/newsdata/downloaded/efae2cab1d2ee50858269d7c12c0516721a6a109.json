Bowel cancer screening is offered to those aged 60 to 74 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - but not anyone younger. The main screening method is the faecal occult blood test (FOBT), which looks for hidden blood in stools. It is posted to people in the age range every two years \u2014 they then post a sample back. Bowel cancer is the UK's second biggest cancer killer - around 16,000 people die from it each year. If caught early, at stage one, patients have a 97 per cent survival rate for at least five years, but discovered later, at stage four, this falls to just 5 per cent for men and 10 per cent for women. Former Tory health secretary Lord Andrew Lansley launched a screening programme, called bowelscope, to detect signs of cancer for 55 year olds eight years ago. It was due to be rolled out nationally in 2016 - but fell foul of financial cuts. Bowel cancer screening starts at 50 in Scotland. The decision to start 10 years later in the rest of the UK has been the subject of controversy. BBC news presenter George Alagiah previously said his bowel cancer could have been caught earlier if the screening programme in England was the same as in Scotland. He was first diagnosed four years ago, at the age of 58; last Christmas he was told that the cancer had returned and it\u2019s now stage four.\n\nThey said that instead of screening based on age alone, everyone's individual risk should be assessed and a test offered.\n\n'People need balanced information to decide whether they wish to screen for colorectal cancer, and public health efforts should focus on shared decision making for individuals who are eligible for screening,' the scientists wrote.\n\n'As many well informed individuals will choose to forego screening, discussion and information sharing on screening for colorectal cancer would be a better marker of care rather than uptake.'\n\nBritish experts criticised the findings, saying there is no accurate way at present to determine individual risk.\n\nDr Lisa Wilde, director of research and external affairs at Bowel Cancer UK, said: 'Inviting people to take part in bowel cancer screening based on their individual risk of developing the disease is absolutely something we would like to see in the future.\n\n'However, at the moment we're a long way off this being possible and as the research highlights, there is more work needed in this area to make this a reality.\n\n'We know that the current bowel cancer screening programme saves lives.\n\n'The new screening test, the faecal immunochemical test, is a game changer as it can detect twice as many cancers and four times as many adenomas (pre-cancerous growths) than the previous screening test and is much easier for people to use.\n\n'We welcome studies that look at ways to improve the current screening programme as early detection of bowel cancer gives people the best possible chance of survival.'\n\nBowel cancer is the second deadliest cancer in the UK, claiming 16,000 lives a year, and about one in 20 are diagnosed with it in their lifetime.\n\nCurrently only 10 per cent of bowel cancer cases are diagnosed through screening, with roughly a fifth of diagnoses not made until the patient is in an emergency department.\n\nBy this time, the cancer has often spread around the body and cannot be cured.\n\nStephen Duffy, professor of cancer screening at Queen Mary University of London, said a move to separate patients based on their risk was 'premature'.\n\nHe said: 'As the panel notes, we already screen based on the most important risk factor of all - age.\n\n'How much the other risk factors would add to this is unclear.\n\n'This also means that it is not certain what the total numbers of lives saved would be in the UK under the panel's recommended regimen compared to the current bowel screening programme.'\n\nBut Professor Anne Mackie, director of screening at Public Health England, said the National Screening Committee will take the new recommendations into account as it looks to improve the screening programme.", "description": "Scientists from Norway, Canada and the US, said those who are at low risk of the disease, but whose home tests raise red flags, could be harmed by the resulting colonoscopies.", "authors": ["Ben Spencer Medical Correspondent For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/16/19210702-0-image-a-36_1570029290200.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
