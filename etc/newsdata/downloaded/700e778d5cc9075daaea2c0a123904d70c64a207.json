Got to think this through strategically.\n\nGears 5? Finish that campaign this week.\n\nThen move to Destiny 2. Still haven\u2019t cleared that game\u2019s original campaign but don\u2019t want to skip ahead. I\u2019ve got two weeks or so to catch up. Probably won\u2019t catch up but will get close.\n\nSomehow juggle Ghost Recon Breakpoint alongside Destiny 2. I am, after all, a sucker for open world Ubisoft games.\n\nRed Dead Online\u2019s big update? I\u2019m curious, but not enough to take the plunge. Need to finish the main game first. Waiting for a slow period, so, not now.\n\nThat upcoming Switch remake of The Legend of Zelda: Link\u2019s Awakening? The one big Zelda I\u2019ve never played. But it\u2019s on Switch, so I can play it any time and therefore wait! Just like I\u2019ve told myself about Fire Emblem: Three Houses, Mario Maker 2\u2019s campaign, Astral Chain, Creature in the Well, Wilmot\u2019s Warehouse, etc, etc.\n\nWait a minute.\n\nMaybe I should delay all of this and try to finish Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey\u2019s bonus quests. The last one came out last week. I could be finished with that game.\n\nI could also hold off on playing Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey again until it comes to consoles in December. Also in December I can finally finish Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man.\n\nBacking up, November\u2019s got Doom Eternal, so I should finally finish Doom 2016 on my Switch before then. Clean out 20GB of space, maybe (no, don\u2019t do this to yourself, Stephen), then download Divinity Original Sin II to the machine. I\u2019ll need space for that Luigi\u2019s Mansion game, too.\n\nWait, didn\u2019t I just read about Ashen getting DLC? I never finished Ashen. I want to play more of that game.\n\nWhat about Borderlands 3? Maybe I can wait on that one, find out later if it\u2019s a must-play. Same with Code Vein. Same with Daemon X Machina. Same with that new Pok\u00e9mon. I sure hope that new Star Wars is going to be great.\n\nThen there\u2019s Death Stranding coming up. Never did play MGSV. Probably should before then, huh?\n\nAnd I thought this was going to be a slow fall.\n\n(Oh, god, I just remembered that I still haven\u2019t finished Outer Wilds. And Outer Wilds makes me think of Outer Worlds. I\u2019m doomed.)", "description": "Lots of games coming up.
