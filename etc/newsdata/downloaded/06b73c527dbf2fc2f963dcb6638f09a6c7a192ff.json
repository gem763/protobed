Bullying animals and force-feeding them is also an act of animal cruelty. Recently, a video showing a man trying to force-feed beer to an alligator, went viral and created outrage.\n\nFlorida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission officers began an investigation into the incident after a complaint was made against two men for catching an alligator in Palm City, US.\n\n27-year-old Timothy Kepke and 22-year-old Noah Osborne were reportedly later charged with unlawfully taking the alligator.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two first made the alligator bite the hand of one - for some unfathomable reason - and then poured beer into its mouth. One can see from the video that the alligator absolutely did not like that, and it sent the little beast into a frenzy.\n\nReportedly when the officers interviewed the accused, Kepke acknowledged that it was indeed him in the video, and he said that the alligator was alive when they released it. The two men were released later, on bond.\n\nDon't Miss 220 SHARES 1.5 K SHARES 6.6 K SHARES 2 K SHARES\n\nThat\u2019s the thing about laws against animal cruelty, they are easy to get out of and there are rarely any serious consequences.
