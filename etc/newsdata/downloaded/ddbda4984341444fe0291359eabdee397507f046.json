It was really upsetting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Coleen knows it\u2019s a problem that can be fixed but it\u2019s still been massively stressful.\u2019\n\nShe denies all claims (Picture: RebekahVardy/Twitter)\n\nColeen is stressed from the refurbishing (Picture: Backgrid)\n\nColeen had already been renovating the home to ensure it is perfect before Wayne returned to the UK after finishing his contract with DC United so it was the perfect opportunity.\n\nThe news comes (before) and after the mum-of-four accused Rebekah Vardy of selling fake stories about her to the press.\n\nShe made the accusations on Instagram, alleging that she set up a plot to expose her fellow WAG.\n\nColeen wrote: \u2018For a few years now someone I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing The Sun newspaper of my private posts and stories.\n\n\u2018There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family \u2013 all without my permission or knowledge. After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.\n\n\u2018To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except ONE account. (Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven\u2019t had stories on there for a while.)\u2019\n\nColeen continued: \u2018Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it\u2019s come from.\n\n\u2018I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It\u2019s\u2026\u2026 Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u2019\n\nYou got us there, Coleen.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
