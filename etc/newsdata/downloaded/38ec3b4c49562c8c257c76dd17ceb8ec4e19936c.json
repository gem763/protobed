MKTS/GLOB\n\nData on Sunday showed China's exports unexpectedly fell in\n\nAugust as shipments to the United States plummeted, pointing to\n\nfurther weakness in the world's second-biggest economy and\n\nunderlining the need for more stimulus. Risk sentiment was also supported by comments from Federal\n\nReserve Chair Jerome Powell that the U.S. central bank would\n\ncontinue to act \"as appropriate\" to sustain the economic\n\nexpansion. Powell's comments and a mixed U.S. employment report firmed\n\nmarket expectations that the Fed would cut interest rates at its\n\nmeeting later this month.\n\nData from the Labor Department on Friday showed U.S. job\n\ngrowth slowed more than expected in August, but strong wage\n\ngains should support consumer spending and keep the economy\n\nexpanding moderately.
