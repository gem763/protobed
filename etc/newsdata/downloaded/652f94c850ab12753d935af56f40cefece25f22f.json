In total, it announced close to 10 new products, including the surprising Surface Duo phone that runs Android. Some other big announcements include Windows 10X, the Surface Neo, Surface Pro X, Surface Earbuds, the Surface Pro 7, and the Surface Laptop 3, the latter of which will be available in two sizes.\n\nCheck out our live blog to see photos and insights from the event as they happened. But if you\u2019re catching up, and just want to look at the headlines, you\u2019ll find the key takeaways below.\n\nMicrosoft has announced an Android-powered foldable tablet-meets-phone. It looks similar to the upcoming Surface Neo, but it\u2019s smaller, has phone functionality, and since it runs on Android, it has access to the Google Play Store.\n\nThe Duo has two 5.6-inch displays merged by a 360-degree hinge. It allows greater cross-functionality between Windows 10 and Android than we\u2019ve seen before.\n\nIt\u2019s coming holiday 2020.\n\nMicrosoft has developed a new version of Windows 10 called Windows 10X. It\u2019s made specifically for multiscreen devices, like the Surface Neo. Microsoft says that it can run all apps, and it must be expecting an influx of devices like these to hit the market.\n\nThe big surprise of this event is Microsoft\u2019s new Surface Neo. It\u2019s a multiscreen device that features two 9-inch displays held together by a sturdy 360-degree hinge. (The screen itself isn\u2019t foldable, like Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Fold.) Microsoft says that this product is still in development, and it\u2019s targeting a holiday 2020 release date.\n\nMicrosoft has engineered a new keyboard for the Neo that can rest on top of the display. It features a Touch Bar-like interface called the WonderBar above it, and when you slide it up toward the hinge, a on-display trackpad section is revealed.\n\nIt runs new software called Windows 10X, which has been engineered specifically for multiscreen devices like this one.\n\nMicrosoft announced the Surface Pro X, a 13-inch 2-in-1 that takes the basic formula of the Surface tablet and refines it. The bezels are smaller, it runs Windows 10, and the Type Cover seems to have been reengineered with a dedicated spot for the Surface Pen.\n\nIt\u2019s powered by Microsoft\u2019s custom SQ1 chipset, which is ARM-based and allows for LTE connectivity. Microsoft says that it has three times the amount of performance per watt than the Surface Pro 6. The GPU apparently pushes over 2 teraflops, which my colleague Tom Warren says is roughly equivalent to what the Xbox One is capable of.\n\nIt\u2019s available for preorder right now for $999, and it will be available in November.\n\nMicrosoft introduced the Surface Earbuds, a set of truly wireless headphones that offer up to 24 hours of battery life with its charging case. These feature what it calls omnisonic sound and a directional dual-array microphone. They feature standard headphone controls, like skipping songs by tapping on the sides. But they also have tight Office integration, surprisingly, like being able to advance slides in PowerPoint.\n\nThey\u2019ll be available later this year for $249.\n\nThe latest iteration of Microsoft\u2019s tablet-meets-laptop gets a big upgrade this year. It charges via USB-C instead of the proprietary Surface Connector the company has used with most of its previous Surface computers. The Surface Pro 7 also has Intel\u2019s 10th Gen processor.\n\nIt\u2019s available for preorder starting today, and the base model costs $749.\n\nThe next iteration of the Surface Laptop will be available in 13- and 15-inch models. It will arrive with Intel 10th Gen quad-core Ice Lake processors with Iris Plus graphics, and Microsoft says that this product is three times faster than Apple\u2019s current MacBook Air. Microsoft worked with AMD to co-engineer the new Ryzen Surface Edition processor in its 15-inch Surface Laptop 3. Microsoft says this processor brings the \u201cfastest graphics performance\u201d of any laptop in its class. Both processors allow this device\n\nNotably, Microsoft will be offering an option without the Alcantara fabric laid over the keyboard area, which will allow it to more easily be repaired \u2014 a big issue for previous versions of this device. Its trackpad is 20 percent bigger than the one found on the Surface Laptop 2.\n\nBoth sizes are available for preorder now, starting at $999 for the 13.5-inch model and $1,199 for the 15-inch model.", "description": "Microsoft\u2019s annual Surface event is over, and we\u2019ve bundled all of the big headlines right here.
