'I call on Turkey as well as the other actors to act with restraint and to stop operations already, as we are speaking, under way,' Juncker said. 'I have to say if the Turkish plan involves the creation of a so-called safe zone, don't expect the European Union to pay for any of it.' NATO Turkey's military operation in northeastern Syria must be restrained, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said today, adding that it was important not to destabilise the region any further. Stoltenberg told reporters that Turkey had 'legitimate security concerns' and had informed NATO about its attack against Kurdish fighters in Syria. 'I count on Turkey to act with restraint and ensure that any action it may take in northern Syria is proportionate and measured,' he said after meeting Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. 'It is important to avoid actions that may further destabilise the region, escalate tensions and cause more human suffering.' Germany German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Turkey's operation would lead to further destabilisation of the region and could strengthen Islamic State. He urged Turkey to end the operation. France France's European affairs minister Amelie de Montchalin said France and Britain would call a U.N. Security Council meeting over the Turkish offensive. France, Germany and Britain are finalising a joint statement condemning the advance. Italy Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the operation risked destabilising the region and harming civilians. Denmark Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod tweeted: 'Deeply concerned about Turkish military operation in Syria. 'In my view, this is a regrettable and wrong decision, which can have serious consequences for civilians and the fight against ISIL (Islamic State). 'Turkey must show restraint. Denmark is in close contact with allies on the matter.' Russia Russian President Vladimir Putin urged his Turkish counterpart President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to 'think carefully' before taking any action. 'Putin called on his Turkish partners to think carefully about the situation so as not to harm overall efforts to resolve the Syrian crisis,' the presidency said following a phone call between the two leaders. Erdogan for his part told Putin that the offensive 'will contribute to Syria's peace and stability and ease the path to a political solution'. Netherlands Dutch foreign minister Stef Blok said he had summoned Turkey's ambassador to condemn the assault. 'I call on Turkey not to follow the path it has chosen,' Blok, whose country is a member of the coalition against the Islamic State, said on Twitter. 'No one can benefit from the potentially terrible humanitarian consequences. The operation can trigger new refugee flows and harm the fight against IS and stability in the region.'\n\nLarge explosions also rocked Ras al Ain, just across the border from the Turkish town of Ceylanpinar, a CNN Turk reporter said. The sound of planes could he heard above and smoke was rising from buildings in Ras al Ain, he said.\n\nThe SDF said military positions and civilians in the city of Qamishli and the town of Ain Issa - more than 20 miles (30km) inside Syria - had been hit, and said there were initial reports of civilian casualties.\n\nTurkish media said mortar and rocket fire from Syria struck the Turkish border towns of Ceylanpinar and Nusaybin. There were no immediate reports of casualties there.\n\nTrump's decision has led to criticism from members of both parties that he abandoned America's Syrian Kurdish allies under pressure from Turkey.\n\nPresident Trump later tweeted that the US should have never used troops in the Middle East and referenced the failed bid to find Saddam Hussein's alleged weapons of mass destruction as the premise for the Iraq war under President George W. Bush as a reason for the US withdrawal from northern Syria.\n\nTrump said he is 'slowly and carefully' bringing soldiers home from the Middle East, ending US involvement in what he described as the 'worst mistake' in the nation's history and winding down nearly two decades of American warfare.\n\nHe told his detractors that culling bloodshed by US soldiers is the 'BIG PICTURE'. He said it's up to regional forces, now, to kill, capture and prosecute the remaining terrorists.\n\nHe declared in cap-filled tweets: 'USA should never have been in Middle East.'\n\nOn his Twitter account, the president wrote: 'The United States has spent EIGHT TRILLION DOLLARS fighting and policing in the Middle East. Thousands of our Great Soldiers have died or been badly wounded. Millions of people have died on the other side. GOING INTO THE MIDDLE EAST IS THE WORST DECISION EVER MADE.....\n\n'....IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY! We went to war under a false & now disproven premise, WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. There were NONE! Now we are slowly & carefully bringing our great soldiers & military home. Our focus is on the BIG PICTURE! THE USA IS GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE!'\n\nHe later retweeted a message criticising Republicans opposing Trumps withdrawal from Syria, adding: 'True. Should have never been there in the first place!'\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham vowed today that Congress will inflict a cost on Turkey for its offensive against Syria's Kurds as the usually loyal ally of President Donald Trump sharply criticised US policy.\n\nGraham said this morning that 'a disaster is in the making,' if Turkey entered Syria.\n\nThe senior Republican later tweeted, referring to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan: 'Pray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration. This move ensures the reemergence of ISIS. Will lead effort in Congress to make Erdogan pay a heavy price.'\n\nThe Turkish leader declared an offensive against US-allied Kurdish fighters who effectively control northeastern Syria after a telephone conversation with Trump, who promised to withdraw US troops serving as a buffer.\n\n'I urge President Trump to change course while there is still time by going back to the safe zone concept that was working,' said Graham\n\nDamascus today said it 'is determined and willing to confront a Turkish assault using all legitimate means,' said a foreign ministry statement carried by state news agency SANA, condemning Ankara's 'hawkish statements, hostile intentions...and military build-up' along the border.\n\nIt said it held 'some Kurdish groups [in Syria] responsible' for the current situation on the border, but would still be ready to 'embrace' them if they decide to return to the fold.\n\nGOP senators like Mitt Romney, Homeland Security Chair Ron Johnson, Energy Committee Chair Lisa Murkowski also accused Trump of 'betraying' and 'abandoning' the Kurds in Syria to no avail.\n\nAnti-war GOP Sen. Rand Paul was one of a handful of Republican lawmakers to openly hail Trump's decision.\n\n'President Trump should be applauded for putting America first! I support bringing our troops home from endless wars in the Middle East!' he said on Tuesday evening.\n\nTurkish Armed Forces' armoured vehicles and armored personnel carriers, carrying Turkish commandos move towards to Turkey's Syrian border as they are being dispatched to support the units at the border, in Kilis today\n\nLarge explosions rocked Ras al Ain, just across the border from the Turkish town of Ceylanpinar.

They [European countries] should take them, try them and follow the due judicial process'.\n\nKurdish leaders also issued a call to civilians to join the military on Wednesday morning and 'do your duty'.\n\nA statement issued by the SDF on Wednesday said: 'The border areas of northeast Syria are on the edge of a possible humanitarian catastrophe.\n\n'All indications, field information and military build-up on the Turkish side of the border indicate that our border areas will be attacked by Turkey in cooperation with Syrian opposition tied to Turkey.\n\n'This attack will spill the blood of thousands of innocent civilians because our border areas are overcrowded.\n\n'Accordingly we call on the international community and all countries of the international coalition who fought together and triumphed together over the so-called ISIS Caliphate to carry out their responsibilities and avoid a possible impending humanitarian disaster.'\n\nThe statement was released shortly before the Kurdish administration in northeastern Syria called up civilians to defend the region against an attack.\n\n'We announce three days of general mobilisation in northern and eastern Syria,' it said, urging all civilians to 'head to the border with Turkey to fulfil their duty.'\n\nTrump golf buddy Lindsey Graham, a leading voice in American foreign policy, urged the president to reverse course\n\nSoldiers patrol the border ahead of an anticipated attack to extend Turkish control of more of northern Syria, a large swath of which is currently held by Syrian Kurds, whom Turkey regards as a threat\n\nA wall separating Turkey from Syria is seen behind a Turkish soldier who stands guard in Akcakale, close to where an expeditionary force is said to have crossed into Syria early on Wednesday\n\nTwo small expeditionary forces of Turkish troops moved into northern Syria on Wednesday morning, an official claimed, ahead of a much larger invasion (pictured, a tank near the border overnight)\n\nThe SDF begged world leaders for help to avoid 'thousands of innocent civilians' being killed as Turkey prepared for a wide-scale invasion (pictured, troops on the Turkish side of the border)\n\nA Turkish officer sits atop this tank as it movers to its new position on the Turkish side of the border between Turkey and Syria\n\nA truck carrying two armoured vehicles makes its way towards the border crossing between Turkey and Syria overnight\n\nTurkey has said President Trump gave assurances to President Erdogan during a phone call that security in Syria would be fully handed over to their control\n\nVehicles carrying the members of Free Syrian Army, a Turkish-backed rebel group, patrol in the Turkish side of the border between Turkey and Syria Wednesday\n\nIn the early part of the eight-year-old civil war in Syria, Kurdish forces took control of Kurdish-majority areas of the the north and east and set up their own autonomous institutions.\n\nWhen the Islamic State group swept across the region in 2014, they mounted a fierce defence of their heartland and became the US-led coalition's main military partner on the ground.\n\nAnkara strongly opposed Washington's support for Kurdish forces in Syria citing their links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) which has fought a deadly insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984.\n\nDamascus rejects Kurdish self-rule and wants central government institutions restored in Kurdish-held areas.\n\nThe Kurds want protection from the long-threatened Turkish offensive.\n\nWeakened by Washington's decision to withdraw most of its troops following the capture of the last vestige of IS's 'caliphate' in March, the Kurdish-led alliance has opened talks with Damascus.\n\nBut the negotiations have yet to bear fruit.\n\nTurkey has already carried out two cross-border offensives into Syria, including one in 2018 that saw it and allied Syria rebels overrun the majority Kurdish Afrin enclave in the northwest.\n\nMany Syrians displaced by fighting elsewhere in the country have fled to the Aleppo region in the hopes of seeking shelter there.\n\nAccording to data collected by Global Shelter Cluster, which is leading relief efforts in Syria, there are currently some 600,000 people receiving aid in the Aleppo region -

in 2016 and 2018 - to push back from its border Islamic State group jihadists and Kurdish militia fighters. Known as Euphrates Shield, Turkish artillery pound dozens of ISIS targets around the Syrian border town of Jarabulus, near the Euphrates river in the early hours of August 24, 2016. On February 24, 2017, the Turkish army announces it has taken control of the Syrian town of Al-Bab, the final objective of Euphrates Shield and the last IS bastion in Syria's northern Aleppo province. For Ankara, control of the town means it can establish a buffer between the different Kurdish-controlled territories in northern Syria, preventing them from uniting. On January 20, 2018, Turkey launches a major air and ground operation, dubbed Olive Branch, against the YPG in Syria's region of Afrin, about 30 kilometres from the border. The next day, Turkish tanks and soldiers enter the region. Ankara says it aims to create a security zone deep inside Syria. On March 18, Turkish forces and their Syrian auxiliaries oust the Kurdish militia from the town of Afrin and raise the Turkish flag.\n\n'YPG militants have two options: They can defect or we will have stop them from disrupting our counter-ISIS efforts.'\n\nAnkara says the creation of a safe zone will allow for the return of Syrian refugees in Turkey, and create greater regional stability.\n\nHowever, observers warn fresh conflict along the border will destabilise the region and likely lead to an ISIS resurgence as the SDF diverts forces to fight the Turks.\n\nOvernight the SDF reported three suicide bomb attacks in Raqqa, the defacto capital of ISIS's self-declared Caliphate, by sleeper cells which had activated in the city.\n\nEarly on Wednesday the group tweeted: 'Daesh takes advantage of Imminent Turkish invasion.\n\n'Three ISIS suicide bombings on our military positions in Raqqa, clashes still ongoing.'\n\nDaesh is a derogatory Arabic term for ISIS.\n\nWhile previous plans for a 'peace corridor' outlined by Erdogan at the United Nations called for it to extend 20 miles into Syrian territory, Altun suggested on Tuesday night that it could go far beyond this.\n\nIf Turkish forces were allowed to spread their reach to the Raqqa-Dier Ezzor line - he wrote in the Washington Post - then it would allow them to resettle some 3million refugees, including 1million currently in Europe.\n\nExtending Turkish control that far into Syria would mean taking control of almost all the territory that Kurdish forces now control.\n\nDescribing Kurdish fighters as 'armed thugs', Altun said their forces threaten the existence of the Turkish state, and must be eliminated.\n\nTurkey-backed members of Syrian National Army prepare for moving to Turkey for an expected military operation by Turkey into Kurdish areas of northern Syria\n\nTurkey-backed members of Syrian National Army riding in machine gun-mounted trucks yesterday as troops amassed along the Turkish-Syria border\n\nThe Syrian National Army preparing for military operations.

Turkey has historically treated the Kurds unsympathetically and has effectively made them 'mountain Turks' by driving them into the hilly areas around the south of the country. The founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal, better known as Atat\u00fcrk, pushed through a constitution 70 years ago which denied the existence of distinct cultural sub-groups in Turkey, which the Kurds fall under. Due to this, when the Kurds - along with other minorities in the country - express ethnic differences it has been repressed by the government. Up until 1991 the daily use of the Kurdish tongue was outlawed and seen as separatism, and even today any minor expression of Kurdish nationalism can lead to imprisonment. The government thwarts any effort by the Kurds to become political, with parties consistently shut down and party members often imprisoned for 'crimes of opinion'. The historical repression led to the creation of the PKK, an armed separatist movement, in 1984. Most Kurds in Turkey do not promote separatism from the Turkish state, but a large number back the PKK. Who are the Kurds? There are around 35million Kurds living in the hilly parts of Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Iran and Armenia - making them the fourth-largest ethnic group in the Middle East. Yet they do not have a permanent state. They do not have an official dialect but are part of a united community through race, culture and language. The Kurdish people are made up of a number of religions but they are mostly Sunni Muslims. The idea of a 'Kurdistan' came about in the 1900s following the fall of the Ottoman Empire after the First World War. The Treaty of Sevres among the Western nations in 1920 also made provision for one. But just three years later the Treaty of Lausanne overwrote this as it set the new boundaries for Turkey. There was no space for a Kurdistan and left them stranded as a minority community in other countries. Attempts over the rest of the 20th Century to bring about an independent state were dashed at every turn. What do they want? The Kurdish people make up around 10 per cent of the Syrian population and most lived in Damascus and Aleppo before uprisings started against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011. Despite this, they have never had basic rights and at least 300,000 have had citizenship requests denied since the 1960s. Land has also been consistently taken from them and given to Arabs in a bit to 'Arabize' the area. In 2011 when uprisings got underway, most Kurds did not publicly back a side, but from halfway through 2012 they seized the opportunity when government forces withdrew to fight rebels elsewhere. The main Kurdish parties, notably the Democratic Union Party in January 2014 announced the creation of 'autonomy' for the areas of Afrin, Kobane and Jazira. This escalated to a 'federal system' in March 2016 in Turmen and Arab areas snatched from ISIS. This, unsurprisingly, was turned down by Assad, as well as the country's official opposition and the Americans. The Democratic Union Party claims it is not looking for independence, but says there must be Kurdish legal rights and autonomy in any political end to the Syrian war. In government there has been a disparity, with Assad pledging to fight back for all of Syria, but his foreign minister hinting at possible talks with the Kurds in September 2017. What does Turkey want? Turkey wants a 'safe zone' in northern Syria - 30 kilometres deep and 300 miles wide - that would push the YPG away from its border. It says the buffer zone would also allow for the return of some of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees currently in Turkey, where anti-refugee sentiment is growing. The YPG spearheaded the fight on the ground against the Islamic State (IS) group as part of the Syrian Democratic Forces, with the support of the US-led international coalition. But Ankara says the YPG is a 'terrorist' offshoot of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has waged a bloody insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984. A victory for Erdogan? Since Erdogan has long pushed for the 'safe zone', the US move is 'absolutely' a victory for him, said Steven Cook, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. 'Erdogan has been working tirelessly to convince (US President Donald) Trump that the US should leave Syria so that Turkey can prosecute the fight against the YPG and resettle Syrians,' he said. The White House decision came after a phone call between Trump and Erdogan, demonstrating the Turkish leader's ability to convince his American counterpart despite resistance within the US administration. 'By giving the green light to Turkey to intervene, the United States has given the impression of having 'capitulated' with Turkish demands,' said Jana Jabbour, a Turkish foreign policy expert at Sciences Po in Paris. 'This in itself is a diplomatic victory for Erdogan,' she said. Challenges ahead? Turkey has launched two military operations supporting Syrian opposition fighters - in northern Syria against IS in 2016 and against the YPG in 2018. But a question remains over Turkey's ability in the air. During the offensive against the Kurdish enclave of Afrin in early 2018, Ankara needed Russia's permission for Turkish planes to take off. The latest plan is much bigger in scope - and more expensive. 'A new Syria operation will generate economic costs, and it is not certain that in the context of the current recession in Turkey the country has the means for such an operation,' Jabbour said. She also pointed to growing scepticism among the Turkish public towards Ankara's involvement in the 'Syrian chaos'. 'This is why Ankara would have preferred an agreement with the United States for the establishment of the safe zone on the border, a scenario which would have allowed Turkey to share the burden with Washington,' Jabbour said. How to manage IS? Turkey has another burden, as the White House said Ankara would now be responsible for IS fighters captured over the past two years and held in Kurdish detention centres. Trump, who has frequently urged European governments to repatriate jihadists from their countries, has now pushed the problem onto Turkey. Erdogan said Monday that Washington and Ankara would work on the issue together but he did not elaborate on the form of the eventual cooperation. 'Now Turkey has to confront IS, which shows every indication of trying to regroup and threaten the countries in the area,' Cook said. However, Erdogan's spokesman insisted in a tweet on Monday that Turkey 'will not allow (IS) to return in any shape and form'.\n\nHe initially had hoped to do it in collaboration with the United States but grew frustrated with what he considered to be delaying tactics by the U.S.\n\nOnce secured, Turkey wants to resettle the area with 2 million Syrian refugees who fled to Turkey due to the conflict in their home country.\n\nHow such a massive resettlement would be carried out is unclear. Human rights groups have warned that any escalation of fighting in the area could displace hundreds of thousands more people.\n\nErdogan has spoken of plans to build towns, villages, hospitals and schools but also says Turkey, which has already spent some $40 billion on the refugees, cannot afford to do it alone.\n\nHe has said he will convene a donors conference to help meet the cost and has called on European nations to share the burden, warning that Turkey could be forced to open the 'gates' for an influx of migrants to Western nations.\n\nTurkey has carried out two previous incursions into northern Syria in recent years with the help of Syrian rebels.\n\nIn the first offensive in 2016, Turkey pushed back Islamic State group militants west of the Euphrates River.\n\nIn the second operation last year, Turkey captured the Syrian-Kurdish controlled enclave of Afrin.\n\nThose regions are currently administered by Turkish-backed opposition groups who run them as virtual Turkish-administered towns.\n\nAnalysts say this operation would likely be more complicated.\n\nThe SDF says ISIS has already launched three suicide attacks in Raqqa, the group's former capital, in expectation of a Turkish assault\n\nIf Turkey claims all the territory currently held by the SDF then it will become responsible for between 10,000 and 15,000 ISIS fighters - 2,500 of whom are foreign-born (pictured, an SDF soldiers guards ISIS prisoners)\n\nThe SDF is also responsible for guarding the notorious Al-Hawl prison camp, where many captured ISIS wives and their children are being held (pictured)\n\nUnwilling to let go of an area they wrested from the Islamic State group, the battle-hardened Kurdish fighters - trained and equipped by the U.S. - have vowed to fight the Turks until the end.\n\n'It's a huge area for the Turkish military to go into and clearly there will be resistance on the part of the (Syrian Kurdish forces),' said Bulent Aliriza, of the director of the Turkey Project at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nAliriza suggested the operation may be a limited one that does not stretch all the way to the Iraqi border.\n\n'That's what we are going to look at first. How deep and how broad is it, whether it's all the way across from the Iraqi border to the Euphrates, or just limited to two or three penetration points,' he said.\n\nCritics of Trump's decision fear a Turkish operation could have destabilizing consequences for the region, while both Democrats and Republicans have warned that a Turkish attack could lead to a massacre of the Kurds, who are holding thousands of captured IS fighters and their families.\n\nOne of the big question marks surrounding Turkey's plans is whether fighting the Syrian Kurdish forces would allow IS to make a comeback.\n\nTurkey insists that the global battle against the militants won't suffer, and points to its 2016 incursion, which drove away IS from another border region.\n\nBut Kurdish officials have warned that they would have to divert their forces away from guarding IS prisoners in case of a Turkish assault.\n\nThe White House has said Turkey will take over responsibility for the imprisoned fighters, but it is unclear how that would happen, if it all.\n\nErdogan says Turkey and the United States are working separately on plans to repatriate foreign fighters held in Kurdish prisons.", "description": "The Turkish military operation into Syria has been launched with airstrikes and will be supported by artillery and howitzer fire, as civilians we seen fleeing the aerial bombardment.", "authors": ["Chris Dyer", "Chris Pleasance For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/17/19501596-0-image-a-4_1570638901463.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
