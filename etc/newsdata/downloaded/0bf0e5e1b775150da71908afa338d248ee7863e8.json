Obama couldn\u2019t come close.... A man named @VanJones68, and many others, were profusely grateful (at that time!). I SIGNED IT INTO LAW, no one else did, & Republicans deserve much credit.\u201d\n\nHe apparently did not think the MSNBC special gave him and Republicans their proper due for passing what\u2019s known as the First Step Act.\n\n\u201cBut now that it is passed, people that had virtually nothing to do with it are taking the praise,\u201d he continued. \u201cGuys like boring\u2026 musician @johnlegend, and his filthy mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is - but I didn\u2019t see them around when we needed help getting it passed.\u201d\n\nLegend later responded to Trump by imploring first lady Melania Trump to help calm her husband down with love.\n\n\u201cImagine being president of a whole country and spending your Sunday night hate-watching MSNBC hoping somebody\u2014ANYBODY\u2014will praise you,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMelania, please praise this man. He needs you.\u201d\n\nAs for Teigen, whom Trump blocked on Twitter more than two years ago, she had a more direct message to the president. She tweeted, \u201clol what a pussy ass bitch. tagged everyone but me. an honor, mister president.\u201d\n\nLater, she added, \u201cthe absolute best part of his tweet is I literally didn\u2019t speak in the special, nor was I mentioned. I\u2019m cackling at the pointless addition of me because he cannot not be a bitch.\u201d\n\nDuring the #JusticeForAll special, Legend promoted his organization FREEAMERICA, which \u201caims to amplify the conversation about mass incarceration at the local, state, and national levels.\u201d\n\nThe president went on to attack the host of the special in his tweetstorm, complaining that Lester Holt didn\u2019t \u201ceven bring up the subject of President Trump or the Republicans when talking about\u2026 the importance or passage of Criminal Justice Reform. They only talk about the minor players, or people that had nothing to do with it\u2026 And the people that so desperately sought my help when everyone else had failed, all they talk about now is Impeaching President Trump!\u201d\n\nHowever, during the Dateline episode that preceded the town hall on Sunday night, Holt did explicitly give Trump credit for passing the law, showing footage of him signing the bill in the Oval Office and noting that is \u201cprojected to reduce the sentences of thousands of non-violent offenders in federal prisons.\u201d But, the anchor added, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t affect more than 90 percent of the U.S. prison population, which is locked up in state and local facilities.\u201d", "description": "The president went on a Twitter tirade against John Legend and his \u201cfilthy mouthed wife\u201d Sunday night.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568005653/RTX6OF1M_tnqnav", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
