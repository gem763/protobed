There\u2019s a 60-day wait before any of the products can be sold in stores.\n\nThe rules around edibles are pretty conservative.\n\nThere is a 10 milligram THC limit per package of solid and drinkable edibles\u2014that\u2019s basically one serving size per package (or can, in the case of a drink.)\n\nThere is also a 10 mg THC limit per unit for ingestible extracts, with 1000 mg cap per package. The 1000 mg THC cap per package also applies to topicals (e.g. skin creams) an inhalable extracts like dabs.\n\nProducts can\u2019t contain nicotine or alcohol and cannot appeal to children.\n\nIt\u2019s still not clear what the ban on products that appeal to kids really means. Health Canada hasn\u2019t outright banned gummies, for example. So we\u2019ll have to wait and see what makes it to market.\n\nPackaging must be plain and child-resistant and no elements can be associated with alcohol\u2014so marketing something as a cannabis \u201cmargarita\u201d won\u2019t fly.\n\nAnd provinces are able to tighten the restrictions. Quebec has already banned any dessert-type edibles, which is in line with its other foolish cannabis-related regulations.\n\nAll that said, the edibles market is predicted to be a big one and will likely help transition people from the black market to the legal one.\n\nEstimates vary quite dramatically, but Deloitte predicts Canada\u2019s edibles and topicals market will be worth more than $2.5 billion.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Manisha Krishnan on Twitter.", "description": "But you can\u2019t buy them yet.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da86edea8cf7f000a655317/lede/1571320143873-Screen-Shot-2019-10-17-at-94826-AM.png?crop=1xw:0.8490366541353384xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
