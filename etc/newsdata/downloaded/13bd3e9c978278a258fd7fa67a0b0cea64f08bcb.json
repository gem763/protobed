Per Apple Insider, who was present at Dickinson\u2019s premiere at the Tribeca TV Festival on Saturday evening, John Mulaney is confirmed to portray transcendentalist extraordinaire Henry David Thoreau on the show opposite Hailee Steinfeld\u2019s poet. Besides the casting confirmation, we have zero idea what will lead to Mulaney\u2019s (neck)bearded arrival in the Dickinson clan\u2019s orbit, but this is coming from a place where Wiz Khalifa will literally be playing a death \u201cmuse,\u201d so we guess anything is possible. Mulaney joked about Dickinson in his 2015 stand-up special The Comeback Kid, which, if history were to repeat itself, means he\u2019ll be starring in a big-screen J. J. Bittenbinder biopic in two and a half years. We don\u2019t make the rules!", "description": "John Mulaney will be playing Henry David Thoreau in Apple\u2019s upcoming television show Dickinson, about Emily Dickinson.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/15/15-mulaney.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
