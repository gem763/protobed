El Salvador and the Dominican Republic followed in 2018. And in a four-day period in September this year, the Solomon Islands and Kiribati, both Pacific Island countries, left Taiwan behind.\n\nNow just 15 countries, five of them small Pacific islands, have full diplomatic relations with Taipei, compared to 180 that recognize Beijing.\n\nIn an email interview, Dr. Anna Powles, a senior lecturer at the Centre for Defence and Security Studies at New Zealand's Massey University and an expert on security issues in the Pacific, explained why countries are embracing Beijing, how the US and others have responded, and why some in the region aren't won over by those responses.\n\nChristopher Woody: For the countries in the Pacific that have switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China, what factors have influenced their decisions to do so?\n\nAssociated Press\n\nDr. Anna Powles: The factors that drove the Solomon Islands and Kiribati to switch diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in September have less to do with ideology and more to do with development imperatives and domestic politics.\n\nChina is seen as having more to offer, and certainly from an infrastructure development perspective, that is true.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind too that this was very much a political decision in both countries, and, in the case of the Solomon Islands, the process \u2014 which was meant to have included public consultations \u2014 was circumvented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWoody: What efforts have the US, its partners in the region, and other Western countries made to counter China's influence among Pacific Island countries, and how have those island countries responded to those efforts?", "description": "The benign neglect of the US and its partners in the Pacific created an opening for China, according to Dr. Anna Powles.", "authors": ["Christopher Woody"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KSyVN3I35D_7rIdLRo67Jw--~B/aD03MDA7dz0xNDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/d893609fa74c74428ebe7c1f7bcb660e", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
