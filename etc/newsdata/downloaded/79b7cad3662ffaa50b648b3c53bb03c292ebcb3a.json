The driver reportedly heard the boys pleading from the back of the truck to be let out.\n\n\"The driver sought the assistance from Broadmeadows Police to remove the pair who were known to police,\" the statement reads. They sustained minor injuries during the ordeal and were assessed by paramedics at the scene, but no police action was taken. The statement described the outcome as \u201ca lucky escape.\u201d\n\nThis is a truly ludicrous series of events, yes, but it also serves as a timely reminder that you should avoid getting in bins, if you can help it. For further proof, please see the video below of a child in Zurich who climbed into a trash can thinking it would be good for a laugh, while not realising that some of the city\u2019s bins empty their contents into an underground storage space when the lid closes. The video is aptly titled \"Kid Falls Through Trash Can.\" You\u2019ve been warned, people.\n\nFollow Gavin on Twitter or Instagram", "description": "The truck's next stop just so happened to be a Melbourne police station.", "authors": ["Talia Slonim", "Meera Navlakha"], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d706a41082121000814c516/lede/1567649677061-pjimage-2019-09-05T121424225.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
