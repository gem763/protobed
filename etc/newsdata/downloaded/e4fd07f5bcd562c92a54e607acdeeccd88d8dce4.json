We talked about how bewildering it was to be alive at a time when viral ideas can slide so precipitously into terror. Then I wondered what steps should be taken. Immediately, our conversation ran aground. \u201cNo steps,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat exactly do you have in mind? Thought police?\u201d He told me that he was a leftist, but he considered his opinion about free speech to be a matter of settled bipartisan consensus.\n\nI imagined the same conversation, remixed slightly. What if, instead of talking about memes, we\u2019d been talking about guns? What if I\u2019d invoked the ubiquity of combat weapons in civilian life and the absence of background checks, and he\u2019d responded with a shrug? Nothing to be done. Ever heard of the Second Amendment?\n\nUsing \u201cfree speech\u201d as a cop-out is just as intellectually dishonest and just as morally bankrupt. For one thing, the First Amendment doesn\u2019t apply to private companies. Even the most creative reader of the Constitution will not find a provision guaranteeing Richard Spencer a Twitter account. But even if you see social media platforms as something more akin to a public utility, not all speech is protected under the First Amendment anyway. Libel, incitement of violence and child pornography are all forms of speech. Yet we censor all of them, and no one calls it the death knell of the Enlightenment.", "description": "", "authors": ["Andrew Marantz", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Sunday Free-Speech-Social-Media-Violence.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
