It also installed technical blocks to prevent HiQ from accessing otherwise publicly available information on LinkedIn users. A 2017 ruling ordered LinkedIn to stop blocking the startup. LinkedIn appealed.\n\nLinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft Corp., said it is disappointed in the decision and evaluating options for an appeal. HiQ did not immediately respond for a message by the Associated Press for comment Monday.\n\nOrin Kerr, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley called the ruling a \"major decision for the open internet.\"\n\n\"It doesn't establish that scraping websites is completely legal, but it goes a long way toward establishing that it's not a federal crime,\" he said.\n\nThe decision, he added, means that, while a hacker could be arrested for breaking into a website, a person \"can't be arrested and prosecuted just for visiting it.\"", "description": "Company called HiQ Labs wins court OK to scrape profiles on LinkedIn for data about people's lives and connections", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/07/19/e4ab7ca7-e5f6-4d24-9cf4-ae1427c99f13/thumbnail/1200x630/46b559bd10719fe567d9706a25ef85a4/istock88471337large.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
