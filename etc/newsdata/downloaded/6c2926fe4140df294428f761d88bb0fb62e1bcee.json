It was a humid Wednesday in Los Angeles, and even though she didn\u2019t know the boy, she overheard that he was also 17 and had been stopped for riding an electric scooter helmetless and underage \u2014 exactly what she had just done, on her way to return a pair of Warby Parker glasses in Santa Monica. It earned him a $500 ticket and a court date his parents would have to attend. Angelica was next in line.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working too hard this summer to pay $500 for this stupid shit,\u201d she recalled thinking in an interview with The Verge. Fortunately, she had a plan. When it was her turn, she handed the officer an ID from a year spent in Spain with her birthday written day-month-year. The trick worked, the officer was convinced she was 18, and only wrote her a ticket for riding without a helmet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working too hard this summer to pay $500 for this stupid shit.\u201d\n\nBird\u2019s headquarters are in Santa Monica, but it rents electric-powered scooters in 41 cities in the US, as well as Paris and Tel Aviv. Meanwhile, other companies have placed tens of thousands of scooters in cities such as Washington, DC, Portland, and Los Angeles. The scooters began showing up in cities a year ago, growing exponentially thanks to millions of dollars that investors like Uber and Google have put into startups like Lime, Scoot, Jump, and Skip. The vehicles, which look like souped-up Razor scooters, cost $1 to unlock, 15 cents for each minute of riding, and can go up to 15 mph.\n\nThe scooters have become wildly popular among adult riders \u2014 Lime says it has racked up 6 million trips between June 2017 and July 2018. Last June, Lime and Bird received valuations of $1 billion and $2 billion, respectively, and the scooters have inspired everything from protests to rap songs.\n\nBut while they are only supposed to be used by adults over the age of 18 with valid driver licenses, the scooters have also become insanely popular among teenagers, with young people like Angelica skirting the law to ride them to work, the movies, shopping, and just about everywhere teens go these days. The Verge interviewed ten high schoolers, including seven who had ridden underage, to get a better sense of the growing trend. Most said they ignored the rules to use the scooters out of necessity or to hang out with friends.\n\nAngelica, for instance, said she didn\u2019t want to pay for car insurance or to sit in LA\u2019s notorious traffic on her way to waitress at a seafood restaurant on the Santa Monica Pier. If she got a bike, she was too afraid it would get stolen. Instead, she preferred to commute on a Bird scooter every day to work this summer, and when Bird turned off its service at night, she came home on a Lime scooter. She also rode to the movies or with friends to get tacos, racking up 250 rides on Bird and 150 on Lime this summer alone.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re out of our cars, they\u2019re much cheaper than Ubers, and you look pretty cool,\u201d said Angelica, who only wanted to use her first name.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re out of our cars, they\u2019re much cheaper than Ubers, and you look pretty cool.\u201d\n\nUnderage scooting isn\u2019t just an LA thing. Teens from San Francisco to Washington, DC have ridden illegally, including Ashton, 17, who said he sometimes scooters home after school in DC, but mostly rides with friends. \u201cIt\u2019s a quick way to navigate across the city,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can tell people are looking at you, but it makes you feel different.\u201d\n\nMax Gorman, 17, also rides in Washington. He last rode a few blocks to the bank, but on another occasion, he rode four miles across the city to see a friend. He boasts about pushing the scooters past their intended speed limits going down hills, which Lime cautions against. \u201cYou can get up to 25,\u201d Gorman said. \u201cYou get a major adrenaline rush. That you can go about as fast as a car on the road is an exhilarating feeling,\u201d said Ashton.\n\n\u201cYou get a major adrenaline rush.\u201d\n\nOf course, that exhilaration can backfire or lead to questionable decisions. \u201cI saw one kid who went straight through an intersection with cars about to go,\u201d Ashton said. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018That is so stupid.\u2019\u201d\n\nAll of the teenagers interviewed by The Verge said they refuse to wear helmets, though the companies and cities they operate in typically require helmet usage. (In California, a bill on governor Jerry Brown\u2019s desk could lift the helmet requirement for riders 18 and over.) Most services provide helmets for riders who request them.\n\nAngelica said she went helmetless on the way to a date because she didn\u2019t want to ruin her hair \u2014 but she also said wearing a helmet compromised her \u201caesthetic.\u201d \u201cI only break one law, and that is the helmet law,\u201d she said. (In reality, Angelica also breaks the age requirement law.)\n\nOther riders interviewed said they\u2019ve watched underage friends ride two-at-a-time, or jump and rotate the scooters in the air. Some have even crashed, such as Max Wix, 15, who fell off a Skip scooter in DC while leaning back riding down a hill. Wix lost three brackets off his braces and chipped a tooth. \u201cI was in shock and surprise and pain,\u201d said Wix, whose 13-year-old sister, Ruthie, introduced him to the scooters. \u201cI went home after that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were kind of laughing until we realized he was hurt,\u201d Ashton, who was riding alongside Wix at the time, said. \u201cHe was inches away from losing his teeth.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was inches away from losing his teeth.\u201d\n\nWix avoided a trip to the emergency room, only going to the orthodontist \u2014 though the Washington Post recently reported that hospitals across the country have seen a surge of scooter-related injuries in recent months, with the Nethercutt Emergency Center at UCLA in Santa Monica treating 18 serious injuries over the final two weeks of July. Last week in Dallas, a man reportedly died after falling off a Lime in what is thought to be the first scooter-related death.\n\nTo be fair, the age requirement is easy to ignore. To ride, you first punch in a phone number and a payment method to each service\u2019s app before finding a scooter from a map. The scooters unlock after you scan a QR code, typically found on the handlebars. On Lime, there\u2019s no age check once a user certifies that they\u2019re 18 by signing the user agreement \u2014 just a reminder of the 18+ and license requirement from a decal on the scooter\u2019s neck and a message in the app.\n\n\u201cBy getting on the scooter, you\u2019re acknowledging that you\u2019re over 18,\u201d Lime spokeswoman Emma Green said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to test various things to ensure safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy getting on the scooter, you\u2019re acknowledging that you\u2019re over 18.\u201d\n\nLime did promise to verify age by scanning the barcodes on riders\u2019 driver\u2019s licenses in its successful proposal to operate in Santa Monica, a key piece of the city\u2019s administrative regulations for scooter operators. If a license indicates the user is a minor, the app prevents them from riding.\n\nBut Lime doesn\u2019t scan licenses anywhere else. In late August, when the San Francisco Municipal Transit Agency awarded permits for scooter operation, Lime didn\u2019t receive a permit. The San Mateo-based company is the only one that failed to promise license-scanning \u2014 a decision they made in June, citing concerns regarding \u201cdata privacy and security issues\u201d in addition to discouraging the \u201cimmigrant community from riding.\u201d Green reiterated the company\u2019s concerns regarding data in an email to The Verge.\n\nLime also doesn\u2019t verify age in DC beyond the user agreement, and their warnings didn\u2019t stop Gorman. \u201cThey didn\u2019t really have any way of proving I was under 18. I was just like, \u2018I\u2019ll be responsible,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let a little sign stop me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a Google account,\u201d said Wix. \u201cAll you have to say is \u2018I am that age,\u2019 and they say, \u2018Okay, we believe you.\u2019 If they really made you verify, they would lose some business.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they really made you verify, they would lose some business.\u201d\n\nSkip, on the other hand, received a permit in San Francisco based in part on a promise to verify rider ages. Darren Weingard, general counsel to Skip, said the company already scans licenses throughout California, though it doesn\u2019t in DC, one of its other markets. Weingard cautioned underage riders against interpreting the lack of enforcement as encouragement. \u201cWe\u2019re not targeting our service to children,\u201d Weingard said. \u201cThere are many ways we could consider looking at age compliance and they\u2019re all under review.\u201d\n\nIn an email, Weingard later said that license-scanning may cause issues for cities regarding data and \u201cdiscrimination against those who don\u2019t have government IDs.\u201d\n\nBird scans licenses nationwide, but Angelica said she used a Chinese-made fake ID that shows her as a 21-year-old from Arkansas (different than the one she gave the policeman) to unlock access to Bird. She also has friends who scanned siblings\u2019 and parents\u2019 licenses \u2014 something that Bird said it wanted to crack down on in its proposal to operate in Santa Monica. As scooters proliferate, license scanning is unlikely to catch on, said Santa Monica personal injury attorney Catherine Lerer. \u201cIf you require a license, you\u2019re limiting your rider population,\u201d she said.\n\nAngelica said other services adding license scanning probably won\u2019t change much. \u201cI think everyone\u2019s conning the system so much with Bird that it\u2019s not going to make a difference,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI think everyone\u2019s conning the system so much with Bird that it\u2019s not going to make a difference.\u201d\n\nAs scooter-sharing enters more cities and becomes an increasingly regulated system, more questions may arise regarding how teens interact with the vehicles. But for now, the kids are still riding, including those like Angelica and Max Wix who experienced problems with the scooters.\n\nWix said he started riding again a week after his accident. Though he still doesn\u2019t wear a helmet, he now goes slower and keeps weight off his back foot. Meanwhile, Angelica said roughly five of her friends received tickets ranging from $350 to $500 later in the summer for riding underage, but she also has friends who got off with warnings for riding helmetless.\n\n\u201c\u2018Haha, we didn\u2019t get a ticket\u2019 was the text I got from my group chat,\u201d said Angelica, who sent back a middle finger emoji in response.\n\nAngelica\u2019s ticket later came in the mail for $197, which she sent and paid to the county. She said she started riding again two weeks later, but the ticket changed one thing. \u201cAs someone who now has constant Bird paranoia, I now take a helmet with me,\u201d Angelica said. \u201cI put it in my bag.\u201d", "description": "Teenagers are flocking to electric scooter services like Bird and Lime, ignoring requirements that riders be age 18 or older", "authors": ["Will Kubzansky", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qb4TYbhJX4AWHryFXxIXIbNVxsM=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11665125/VRG_ILLO_2724_Scooter_World_Social.jpg", "published_at": "2018-09-23"}
