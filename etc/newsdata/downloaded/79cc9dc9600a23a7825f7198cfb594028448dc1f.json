My cognitive memory ... just memorizing the dance routine was difficult at times, but I felt like I got better every week. It's so crazy because I felt like this was my best dance tonight.'\n\nPeta - who wept after being voted off - added: 'You get to see like, a one-minute package before we dance every week, and so much work and hours go in behind it that people don't really get to see. It's emotional because I see him every day -- I'm with him for at least four hours a day, and to know the work he's put in behind it, I was just really super proud of him.'\n\nWhile Lamar would have liked to progress further in the competition, he's keeping a positive attitude and focusing on his other work.\n\nBrave: Lamar reflected on his near-fatal 2015 overdose as he was eliminated\n\nThe 39-year-old told Entertainment Tonight: 'I feel all right. I feel good. The sun will shine tomorrow. I'll wake up, work out, move forward.\n\n'It means a lot, especially when I see Peta crying, my sister here.\n\n'I would [have] liked to move on, but since it didn't happen, now I can just move on to other things in my life. Public speaking, telling people my story and I figure I can change lives doing that.'\n\nGuest judge Leah Remini praised Lamar for overcoming his struggles to dance on the show.\n\nLucky to be alive: The former basketball player took the elimination in his stride as he remarked he was 'lucky to be walking and talking' after overdosing in a Nevada brothel four years before - and slipping into a four day coma\n\nShe said: 'I don't think people understand that Lamar is not a dancer, and on top of that he's dealing with [an accident where he was] almost dying.\n\n'It's not easy to learn a dance. Because not only are you learning a new thing that you have never learned in your whole life, but you're doing it live.\n\n'I think he represents what the show is. The fact that he's out there ... and also, I think, he's used to a game face. He's not really used to showing his emotions. He's also a man in sports, I just don't know if they're used to showing their emotions out there.'", "description": "Standing alongside Erin Andrews as she interviewed Hannah Brown, the former NBA star reached down to reorganize his manhood.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/16/19449014-0-image-a-43_1570548182572.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
