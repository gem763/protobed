According to the criminal complaint filed by the victim, Mothershead, 46, flew to the Philippines to meet her in July 2017 and stayed there for three weeks. The suspect allegedly promised his victim, who sold ice to make ends meet, that he would marry her, take care of her family, and send her children to school.\n\nHowever, when the Filipina and her son flew to the United States in November 2018, Mothershead allegedly welcomed them by handing them cleaning gloves and masks as soon as they arrived at the airport. He then brought the two to his filthy home in the city of West Allis and told them to clean the place or else they would not be fed. It was also on that night that Mothershead allegedly raped the Filipina, reported the Journal Sentinel.\n\nThe victim and her son were allegedly enslaved by the suspect for weeks, with Mothershead threatening them that they would not be given food and water if they did not work. The Filipina would often wake up at 5am to prepare breakfast for Mothershead and his own son and would spend the rest of the day cleaning the house.\n\nIn one instance, the Filipina and her son cooked a meal for Thanksgiving but were forbidden by the suspect to eat it. Mothershead allegedly forced the victims to watch him and his own son eat the food.\n\nOne day, the Filipino boy contracted a fever but Mothershead allegedly refused to send him to the doctor. The suspect also repeatedly threatened the Filipina that he would send her and her son back to the Philippines.\n\nAfter several weeks of living with the suspect, the Filipina contacted the police to report the way they were being treated. She and her son sought refuge in a shelter in December 2018, reported WTMJ-TV.\n\nThe suspect is currently on unpaid leave from the school he works in while he is being investigated.
