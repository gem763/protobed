If there is no capital gain, the taxpayer has to wait until it can offset the loss.\n\nIn 2012, Victoria moved from a gaming operator structure dominated by Tattersalls to a venue operator structure. The trustee of the Royal Hotel at Daylesford, 100 kilometres west of Melbourne, bought 18 GMEs lasting 10 years (2012-2022) for $600,300. The trustee arranged a deferred payment by instalments and claimed the purchase price as a deduction or one-fifth of that price.\n\nThe ATO rejected both claims, but the Full Federal Court held the outlay was deductible under general provisions, and alternatively over five years as capital expenditure.\n\nHowever, the High Court said the value of the GMEs \"was not solely attributable to their effect on goodwill, but resided in their capacity to generate gaming income and to be sold and transferred\".\n\nThomson Geer tax partner Ron Jorgensen said the court had arguably limited licence fee deductions without conferring any ownership right in the asset: \"This may adversely affect deductibility of other statutory licence schemes fees.\"\n\nVenue operators that claimed the payments as a general tax deduction or five-year capital expenditure write-off might have to repay those deductions \"if the commissioner is in time to amend their income tax returns\", Mr Jorgensen added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClayton Utz tax partner Amber Agustin said the decision was \"a lesson for businesses in highly regulated industries\".\n\nPenalties and interest\n\n\"The fact that the taxpayer had no commercial choice but to incur an expense in response to legislative change did not affect whether the expense was immediately deductible or not .\n\n\"For those businesses who will have to refund amounts to the ATO, they are also exposed to the imposition of penalties and interest by the commissioner.\"\n\nATO deputy commissioner Jeremy Geale said it was a \"a significant decision\".\n\n\"It provides clarity across the industry about the application of this area of tax law.\u201d", "description": "The High Court has ruled that gaming machine entitlement fees are not deductible, hitting the bottom line of venues such as pubs and casinos.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_4.4148%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d95160c31b4543a790c8dc3becfde90b5dffbb60", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
