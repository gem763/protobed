Given the US pricing, it would be natural to assume that Samsung is releasing a 5G version of the smaller 6.3-inch Galaxy Note 10 to the US \u2014 however, you\u2019d be wrong. Samsung isn\u2019t bringing this version of the phone to the US or other regions, for that matter. The 5G version of the Note 10, which was briefly mentioned on a slide during today\u2019s Unpacked 2019 event, is launching exclusively in South Korea.\n\nAs for why other countries are only getting the Note 10 Plus 5G, there are a few possible reasons. It\u2019s not unusual for Samsung to treat its home country to exclusive variations of its devices, and given that many of South Korea\u2019s cities are densely populated, it\u2019s an ideal testing ground for the Note 10 5G models.\n\nIn fact, in a glass-half-full kind of way, it makes sense that the US and other places will only be offered the larger Note 10 Plus 5G. The US has only a fledgling 5G infrastructure, and where mmWave 5G nodes are actually available, they are only in very small areas.\n\nBesides, how many flagship phones does Samsung really need to introduce at one time?", "description": "If you live outside of South Korea, you\u2019ll have just one size of Note 10 5G to choose from. Samsung teased the existence of a smaller Note 10 5G phone, complete with US pricing, but it\u2019s exclusive to South Korea.", "authors": ["Cameron Faulkner", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yR230vEDcbyC1m3vtS94RAQUuNA=/0x84:1167x695/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18941201/note105gsmall.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-07"}
