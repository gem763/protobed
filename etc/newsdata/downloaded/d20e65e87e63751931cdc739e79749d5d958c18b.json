Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) responded with lazy partisanship, telling Fox News the real controversy was Joe Biden getting a Ukrainian prosecutor fired to protect his son.\n\nEven those who\u2019ve come to expect very little from Rubio were struck by the pitiful response. As the Florida Republican must know, the former vice president \u2013 representing the bipartisan position of the United States and much of the Western world \u2013 targeted an inept prosecutor who wasn\u2019t pursuing a company Biden\u2019s son was associated with. Rubio\u2019s reflexive effort to defend Trump by smearing Biden didn\u2019t even make sense.\n\nThis week, however, the GOP senator was handed a great opportunity to redeem himself. Rubio has earned a reputation as a fierce China critic, so when his party\u2019s president publicly sought Beijing\u2019s assistance in targeting a domestic opponent yesterday, it offered the Floridian the chance to do the right thing, put country over party, and rebuke Donald Trump\u2019s obvious abuse.\n\nAlas, as the Miami Herald reported, the senator chose a different path.\n\n[W]hen President Donald Trump on Thursday publicly called on China to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential 2020 rival, Rubio said Trump\u2019s words were a ruse. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a real request or him just needling the press knowing that you guys are going to get outraged by it,\u201d Rubio told reporters at an economic opportunity event in the Florida Keys on Friday. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty good at getting everybody fired up and he\u2019s been doing that for a while and the media responded right on task.\u201d [\u2026] \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a real request. I think he did it to gig you guys [reporters],\u201d Rubio said. \u201cI think he did it to provoke you to ask me and others and get outraged by it. He plays it like a violin and everybody falls right in, that\u2019s not a real request.\u201d\n\nAs Republican talking points go, this comes up from time to time as a way of shrugging off assorted Trump abuses. Last year, for example, when the White House went after the security clearances of former intelligence officials who\u2019ve criticized the president, then-House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) told reporters, \u201cI think he\u2019s trolling people, honestly.\u201d\n\nIn that example, Ryan may have had a point; Trump didn\u2019t actually follow through. In the effort to compel foreign officials to help the president\u2019s re-election campaign, however, Rubio, in a rather literal sense, doesn\u2019t appear to know what he\u2019s talking about.\n\nIn fact, if there\u2019s one thing that even the most unobservant Republicans should understand at this point, it\u2019s that Trump wasn\u2019t just popping off on Twitter or during an impromptu Q&A. The president and his team hatched a deliberate scheme, involving a variety of officials and offices, in the hopes of trying to coerce campaign assistance out of foreign governments.\n\nTrump wasn\u2019t trolling or trying to get a rise out of reporters; the media didn\u2019t even know about the president\u2019s efforts until reports of a complaint from an intelligence community whistleblower came to the fore.\n\nOn the White House South Lawn yesterday, Trump didn\u2019t speak with a wink and a nod. There was no smirk. No one on his team came forward later in the day to suggest the president was just joshing. What we saw was real: the American president, desperate and afraid, publicly appealed to foreign countries to do his re-election campaign a favor \u2013 again.\n\nTrump could\u2019ve walked it back, and suggested this was all just a joke that journalists failed to understand, but he instead published a follow-up missive claiming an \u201cabsolute right\u201d to pressure foreign governments to target those he deems corrupt.\n\nIt\u2019s the sort of thing Marco Rubio should care about. His indifference says quite a bit about how the Florida Republican approaches his weighty responsibilities, and none of it\u2019s good.", "description": "Marco Rubio's initial response to Trump's Ukraine scandal was pitiful.
