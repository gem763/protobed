Under this scenario, the country\u2019s top diplomat would absorb the national security adviser role and do both jobs, according to a senior administration official and a source familiar with the possibilities.\n\nThat would make Pompeo the second person in history to have both jobs at the same time. The first, Henry Kissinger, was already President Richard Nixon\u2019s national security adviser when he was appointed secretary of state in 1973, and filled both roles for two years.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how seriously Trump is considering this possibility, and a source familiar with the process says that Pompeo has given the President a list of other names to consider. On Wednesday, when asked about his top picks to replace Bolton, the President said, \u201cI have five people that want it very much\u2026 Five people that I consider very highly qualified, good people.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Cnn.Com Politics Pompeo-Kissinger-Model-Bolton-Trump Index.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
