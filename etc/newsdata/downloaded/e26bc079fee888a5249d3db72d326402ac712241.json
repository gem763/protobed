We would like it to show today the same spirit towards us,\u201d the embassy said in its statement.\n\nFrance\u2019s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "description": "China's embassy in Paris on Monday strongly criticised French and European reaction to protests in Hong Kong calling it hypocritical and telling France to show empathy after it experienced its own violent demonstrations.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
