(Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nSerhiy Leshchenko is a Ukrainian journalist and political activist.\n\nOn Aug. 19, 2016, I convened a news conference in Kiev at which I revealed previously secret records of payments made by the former pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych to Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. (Yanukovych fled the country in February 2014 after he was toppled by our Revolution of Dignity, a popular uprising on the streets of Kiev.) The information came from the \u201cblack ledger of the Party of Regions,\u201d which was obtained by an anonymous source in the burned-out ruins of the headquarters of Yanukoych\u2019s party. Yanukovych had used the ledger to keep records of his illegal transactions. At that time, although I was a member of parliament, I continued to combine that position with my journalistic work, which is allowed by the laws of Ukraine.\n\nI will always be angry at Manafort. His work contributed greatly to Yanukovych\u2019s election victory in 2010; Yanukovych then used his position as president to enrich himself and his inner circle. I have no doubt that Yanukovych paid Manafort for his services out of the funds he robbed from Ukrainian taxpayers.\n\nCorruption is harmful whether it takes place America or Ukraine. My desire to expose Manafort\u2019s doings was motivated by the desire for justice. Neither Hillary Clinton, nor Joe Biden, nor John Podesta, nor George Soros asked me to publish the information from the black ledger. I wanted to obtain accountability for the lobbyist whose client immersed Ukraine in a blood bath during the Revolution of Dignity and the subsequent war in eastern Ukraine, when Yanukovych called on Russia to send troops.\n\nA federal judge in the United States later sentenced Manafort to 7\u00bd years in prison for his many crimes. Among his offenses was his non-payment of taxes on undeclared income whose origins were revealed by Yanukovych\u2019s secret accounts.\n\nNever in my wildest dreams did I imagine the Manafort revelations would become fodder for the U.S. elections in 2020. President Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, the mouthpiece of this campaign, is not only attempting to rehabilitate Manafort but is also working to undermine U.S. relations with Ukraine, which has been confronting Russian aggression on its own for more than five years. Giuliani and his associates are trying to drag our newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, into a conflict between two foreign political parties, drastically limiting Ukraine\u2019s room for maneuver in respect to the United States, perhaps its most important international partner.\n\nGiuliani attempted to visit Ukraine in May 2019 with the express purpose of involving Zelensky in this process. His aim was quite clear: He was planning to ask Zelensky to intervene in an American election on the side of Trump.\n\nZelensky refused, forcing Giuliani to cancel his trip. Shortly after that, Giuliani went on Fox News, where he called me \u201c[an enemy] of the president [and] of the United States.\u201d This accusation had a devastating effect on my political career. I had been helping Zelenksy\u2019s team since January \u2014 but now Giuliani\u2019s smear cost me a job in the new administration. Not wanting to create problems for Zelensky, I withdrew from consideration.\n\nGiuliani's entire approach is built on disinformation and the manipulation of facts. Giuliani has developed a conspiracy theory in which he depicts my revelations about Manafort as an intervention in the 2016 U.S. election in favor of the Democratic Party. In his May interview on Fox, Giuliani even claimed that I was convicted of a corresponding crime.\n\nThe facts do not support this allegation. Here\u2019s the truth: The administrative court \u2014 which has long had a reputation as the most corrupt in Ukraine \u2014 ruled in December 2018 that I had acted illegally by disclosing the payments to Manafort. We appealed, and the verdict was suspended. And in the summer of this year, we won the appeal and the court\u2019s decision was completely annulled. The appeal concluded that all the charges against me were unfounded, and even obliged my opponents to reimburse me for $100 in legal costs.\n\nBut Giuliani continues to quote this court decision even though it never attained legal force.\n\nGiuliani also persists in claiming that the \u201cblack ledger\u201d is a fake. He stated this most recently just a few days ago in an interview with CNN. In fact, the book is a genuine document. Expert examinations have confirmed the authenticity of the signatures shown in it.\n\nGiuliani has also been attacking the fearless activists from our Anti-Corruption Action Center, who managed to uphold their ideals even though they were persecuted by the previous government of President Petro Poroshenko.\n\nBy repeating this lie, Giuliani is not only deceiving American citizens. He is not only intervening in Ukrainian politics, smearing parliamentarians and officials of the presidential administration. He is also trying to drag the new president of Ukraine into an American election, which is absolutely unacceptable.\n\nI know that leaders of the three U.S. congressional committees that are now investigating the whistleblower case have asked the White House and the State Department to share all correspondence regarding the people involved in this story, including me. As a person who has had direct experience of many of these events, I express my readiness to testify to the U.S. Congress about what has been happening for the past six months in the gray zone of Ukrainian-American relations.\n\nRead more:\n\nAnne Applebaum: Welcome, Americans, to the Ukrainian swamp\n\nHenry Olsen: Giuliani has got to go\n\nDana Milbank: Trump and his lawyer can do better on Ukraine.
