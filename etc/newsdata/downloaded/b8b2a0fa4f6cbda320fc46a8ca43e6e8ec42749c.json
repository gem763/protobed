I beat him, so he represents no challenge. I said it before the fight and I'm going to repeat it.'\n\nThe manner of Canelo's victory over Golovkin, which split the judges after eight rounds and was considered the wrong decision by many critics, means talk of a third fight has rarely quelled.\n\nMexican superstar Alvarez saw off Daniel Jacobs in their middleweight unification bout in May\n\nGolovkin outlanded Canelo in their original draw, retaining the WBA (Super), WBC, IBF and IBO middleweight titles on a split decision before losing them a year later.\n\nPound-for-pound number one Canelo derided his main rival's display against Derevianchenko, claiming it had shown that shots to the body were the 'pathway' to hurting Golovkin.\n\nThe hugely popular Mexican, whose \u00a3278m deal with broadcasters DAZN is the most lucrative in sports history, strongly hinted that he could be swayed by the kind of figures that gave the original fight the third-highest proceeds ever recorded in boxing.\n\n'What he does represent is some good business,' conceded Canelo, who helped to generate revenue of more than \u00a393m in the second fight.\n\n'So if they offer me something really good, maybe the third fight can happen.'\n\nCanelo will fight Sergey Kovalev for the WBO light heavyweight title at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on November 2, making his first appearance since earning a unanimous points decision over Daniel Jacobs on May 4.", "description": "Golovkin looked far less menacing than he did when he knocked out Steve Rolls in June during a laboured points victory over Ukrainian Serhiy Derevianchenko.", "authors": ["Ben Miller For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/15/19628316-0-image-a-33_1570892074503.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
