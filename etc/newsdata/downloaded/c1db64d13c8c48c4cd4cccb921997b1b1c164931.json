Restructuring them is one. This option came up recently; in August, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, led several of his colleagues in filing a brief with the Supreme Court regarding the scope of the Second Amendment. It accused the Court of being governed by partisan considerations and concluded with a scarcely veiled threat: Quoting a recent poll about the judiciary, the brief hoped the Court could \u201cheal itself before the public demands it be \u2018restructured in order to reduce the influence of politics.\u2019\u201d\n\nRead: America\u2019s fragile Constitution\n\nThis threat may have been overheated\u2014after all, the \u201cneutral justiciability principles\u201d the senators insisted be followed in the case of gun control could not have generated many landmark precedents sacred to the left\u2014but congressional authority to control the court is unquestionable.\n\nIt could not have been otherwise, because the Framers feared unchecked authority for any institution of government, a mood the pseudonymous writer Brutus\u2014an opponent of the Constitution\u2014captured in arguing that the document did not sufficiently check judges: \u201cIn short, they are independent of the people, of the legislature, and of every power under heaven. Men placed in this situation will soon feel themselves independent of heaven itself.\u201d\n\nSupporters of the Constitution were eager to dispel this impression of unchecked judicial power. In \u201cFederalist No. 81,\u201d Alexander Hamilton denied that the Supreme Court could get away with sustained abuses of its power, in part because Congress could retaliate by impeaching justices\u2014a second tool available to elected officials seeking greater control over the courts. \u201cThis is alone,\u201d he wrote, \u201ca complete security.\u201d\n\nA third option for controlling the judiciary is Congress\u2019s power to place boundaries around the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisdiction. This power of \u201cjurisdiction stripping\u201d results from Article III of the Constitution, which gives the Court appellate jurisdiction in certain categories of cases, \u201cwith such exceptions, and under such regulations as the Congress shall make.\u201d\n\nThe political authority inherent in wielding these tools, in turn, is subject to the oversight of the people, who have proved reluctant to support its frequent use. Even in the throes of the Great Depression, Americans rejected Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s plan to save the New Deal by adding several justices to the Supreme Court.\n\nThere is no comparable crisis that would justify congressional interference with the Supreme Court today. (Some assert that Donald Trump\u2019s presidency presents such a crisis, but that is a crisis for voters, not judges, to consider.) The problem is not that these tools are unused, but rather that their deployment has become unthinkable. Justices know they will never be impeached for the content of their rulings, a power Congress has shunned since the abortive impeachment of Justice Samuel Chase in the early 19th century. Similarly, Congress should not restructure the Supreme Court because it disagrees with a single decision or even with a single generation of justices. But the idea that Congress could never legitimately do so encourages judicial arrogance.", "description": "The Founders never intended for the Court to be the final arbiter of what the Constitution means.", "authors": ["Greg Weiner", "Political Scientist At Assumption College"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/resizedConstitution/facebook.png?1569356936", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
