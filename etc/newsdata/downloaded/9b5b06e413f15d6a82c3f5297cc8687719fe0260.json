Boneless, skinless chicken breasts have weeknight appeal, largely because they cook so quickly, but that also means they can dry out and become tough if you\u2019re not careful. Here, the chicken is gently cooked for about 10 minutes, then simmered in a ginger-scented coconut sauce studded with green beans and corn, resulting in tender and juicy chicken. Slicing the breasts before serving allows the sauce to coat each piece, adding more moisture and flavor. If you want more heat, sprinkle thinly sliced serrano chile over the top before serving. The best part is the entire meal comes together in about a half-hour: If you\u2019re quick, you can get all the vegetable prep done while the chicken cooks.", "description": "This fast but fabulous chicken dish pairs Thai-inspired flavors with French technique Boneless, skinless chicken breasts have weeknight appeal, largely because they cook so quickly, but that also means they can dry out and become tough if you\u2019re not careful Here, the chicken is gently cooked for about 10 minutes, then simmered in a ginger-scented coconut sauce studded with green beans and corn, resulting in tender and juicy chicken", "authors": ["Susan Spungen", "Molly O'Neill", "Melissa Clark", "Sarah Copeland", "Jennifer Steinhauer", "Jim Shahin", "Claire Saffitz", "Sam Sifton"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/04/dining/ss-thai-chicken/ss-thai-chicken-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
