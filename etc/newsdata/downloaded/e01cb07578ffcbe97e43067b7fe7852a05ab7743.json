Researchers made use of questionnaires, diaries, and physical assessments throughout the pregnancies of participating members.\n\nThey divided the women into three groups \u2013 those who have a healthy pregnancy with no stress, those who show signs of physical stress and those with signs of psychological stress.\n\nOf the sample group, one in six women were psychologically stressed, reporting negative feelings during their day, feeling overwhelmed and out of control, or indicating mild to moderate depression or anxiety.\n\nA similar number of women showed signs of physical stress, such as higher blood pressure and a tendency to consume more calories, which is suggestive of comfort eating.\n\nAmong the moms-to-be who were physically stressed, less than a third (31%) gave birth to a boy, a ratio of nine girls to every four boys.\n\nThe study\u2019s findings were presented even more clearly among women coping with psychological stressors, with only 40% giving birth to a boy \u2013 a ratio of two baby girls to every boy.\n\nAccording to study leader, Catherine Monk, male foetuses are less likely to \u201csurvive in suboptimal conditions\u201d for an abundance of biological reasons.\n\nFor example, a 2010 study proved that male foetuses grow more quickly in the womb and therefore are more at risk of becoming undernourished and being born prematurely.\n\nMonk claims that the impact of stress on male births can be seen on a population level after catastrophic events.\n\n\u201cOther researchers have seen this pattern after social upheavals, such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York City, after which the relative number of male births decreased,\u201d she says.\n\nAccording to a study, 12% more male babies were lost in September 2001 after the 20th week of pregnancy than expected.\n\n\u201cThis stress in women is likely of long-standing nature; studies have shown that males are more vulnerable to adverse prenatal environments, suggesting that highly stressed women may be less likely to give birth to a male due to the loss of prior male pregnancies, often without even knowing they were pregnant.\u201d\n\nThe findings were published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal (PNAS).\n\nHowever, the negative effect of stress appeared to be offset by social support from friends and family. For example, they found that the more social support a mother received, the more she was likely to give birth to a boy.\n\n\u201cScreening for depression and anxiety are gradually becoming a routine part of prenatal practice,\u201d Monk says.\n\n\u201cBut while our study was small, the results suggest enhancing social support is potentially an effective target for clinical intervention.\u201d\n\nSources: NCBI, PNAS, Columbia University, Daily Mail", "description": "Researchers at Columbia University in New York have found that mothers-to-be who are stressed are more likely to have daughters.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9487/543f81da40c44d2c9796898320510bff.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
