Tilray stock closed Monday just above $20. To be sure, cannabis stocks have seen volatility over the past year, and nearly all of them have declined sharply of late. But none have had quite the highs \u2014 or the pullback \u2014 of TLRY.\n\nThe irony is that I still think Tilray stock is one of the more intriguing stocks in the category. The bubble last year \u2014 and it was a bubble \u2014 has given Tilray the reputation of a fly-by-night operator, or even something close to a \u201cpump and dump.\u201d That\u2019s not the case.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTilray\u2019s long-term strategy, which is to focus not on production, but on products, makes some sense. And as I wrote after Tilray earnings in August, investors\u2019 sudden interest in profitability is odd. Even Tilray CEO Brendan Kennedy noted it after the second-quarter release.\n\nIn fact, I called out TLRY as one of 10 mid-cap stocks to buy in late August. But as I noted at the time, patience was advised: The Tilray stock chart looked like a falling knife.\n\nIt still does \u2014 and that patience still is advised. TLRY, perhaps more than any other pot stock, shows just how much sentiment has changed and how much it will take to reverse it.\n\nWhat Will It Take for TLRY Stock to Rally?\n\nOver the last three months, TLRY stock has lost more than half of its value. And yet, in the context of cannabis investor expectations as recently as this summer, the news hardly seems all that grim.\n\nQ2 earnings were fine. Yes, Tilray missed analyst expectations for profitability. But profits are not the endgame right now \u2014 positioning for cannabis growth is. Tilray\u2019s solid revenue growth is up 371% year-over-year and nicely ahead of analyst estimates. That seemed like a step in the right direction. Investors agreed with that at the start of the year, when pot stocks like TLRY, Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) and Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) were rallying. That\u2019s true no more.\n\nIndeed, off what was at worst a decent quarter, Tilray stock fell 35% in four sessions. A big whiff at Canopy, which pressured the sector, certainly didn\u2019t help. But in no way should the report have driven a 35% decline. And I\u2019d argue that even six months earlier, the same report may well have been perceived as positive, not negative. Even Aphria (NYSE:APHA) has continued to decline despite what was clearly a blowout report. It\u2019s hard to imagine what kind of earnings beat it would take to truly change investor sentiment.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolitical Help, Right?\n\nThe last time cannabis stocks rallied was late last year. And a key catalyst for the rally was the passage of the Farm Bill, which legalized hemp in the U.S.\n\nThat new law was seen as a potential first step toward legalization in the U.S. \u2014 an obviously enormous opportunity for legal cannabis producers. And so the rally, admittedly off lows driven in part by a market-wide selloff, seemed to make some sense.\n\nLate last month, the SAFE Banking Act passed the U.S. House of Representatives. The act allowed banks to legally work with cannabis companies in states where marijuana was legalized. The impact on cannabis stocks was minimal. TLRY stock gained 2.7% that day and the gains were erased in less than two sessions.\n\nTo be sure, the SAFE Banking Act isn\u2019t necessarily going to become law. Indeed, it\u2019s unlikely to pass the Republican-controlled Senate. But, here too, it\u2019s not hard to imagine the reaction being very different last year or even earlier this year. It\u2019s a step in the right direction for the sector, seemingly. But investors don\u2019t care.", "description": "The trading in Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) stock has been jaw-dropping.
