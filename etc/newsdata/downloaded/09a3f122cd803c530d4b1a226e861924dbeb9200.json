Soybeans, the most valuable U.S. agricultural export, have been among the products hardest hit by China's retaliatory tariffs.\n\nLOWERED EXPECTATIONS\n\nThe two sides have been at loggerheads over U.S. demands that China improve protections of American intellectual property, end cyber theft and the forced transfer of technology to Chinese firms, curb industrial subsidies and increase U.S. companies' access to largely closed Chinese markets.\n\nBut Chinese officials, surprised by the U.S. blacklisting of Chinese companies, including video surveillance gear maker Hikvision, (SZ: ) along with the suspension of U.S. visas for some Chinese officials, told Reuters that Beijing had lowered expectations for significant progress from the talks.\n\n\"I've never seen China respond with concessions to someone throwing down the gauntlet in this manner,\" said Scott Kennedy, a China trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \"It suggests to me that the U.S. may have determined that progress was impossible, so everyone is just going through the motions.\"\n\nOther flashpoints that have cropped up in recent days include China's swift action to cut corporate ties to the National Basketball Association over a team official's tweet in support of Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters.\n\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in Sydney on Thursday that the tariffs were working, forcing Beijing to pay attention to American concerns about its trade practices.\n\n\"We do not love tariffs - in fact we would prefer not to use them - but after years of discussions and no action, tariffs are finally forcing China to pay attention to our concerns,\" Ross said in remarks prepared for delivery on an official visit to Australia.", "description": "U.S., China resume high-level talks to end grueling trade war", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF991AH_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
