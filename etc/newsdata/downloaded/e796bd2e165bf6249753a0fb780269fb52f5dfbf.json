They were words related to death, such as 'funeral', 50 per cent of the time.\n\nThese sorts of words appearing next to someone's own face caused the brain's prediction system shut off as it was unable to put itself together with the idea of death.\n\nAs children begin to understand that everybody dies, the mechanism switches on to stop an onslaught of morbid thoughts (stock image)\n\nScientists who conducted the study, that will be published next month in NeuroImage, saw no 'surprise' signals at all when this pairing appeared.\n\nMr Dor-Ziderman added that years ago, death was faced much more regularly than it is now acting as a counterbalance to the brains defences against morbid thoughts.\n\nBut nowadays, people know less about death and are therefore more scared of it.\n\nYet, while people are more apprehensive about the realities of death, this doesn't mean they aren't still entertained by visual depictions of it.\n\nA 2014 study found that people exposed to blood and guts in film clips showed higher levels of attention the more extreme the content became - even though the people watching admitted to being disgusted.\n\nA total of 120 people watched film clips showing three types of disgust, described as socio-moral, body product and death, and gore.\n\nThe experiment was devised by Bridget Rubenking of University of Central Florida, and Annie Lang of Indiana University.", "description": "Researchers at\u00a0Bar Ilan University in Israel studied  participants' 'surprise' signals in their brains.
