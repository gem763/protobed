Reminder: There are 109 days until the Iowa caucuses and 383 days until the 2020 election.\n\nFor the first time, a majority of Americans said this week that they supported the impeachment of President Trump. Not just in one, outlying poll \u2014 in an average of all current national polls compiled by the data journalists at FiveThirtyEight.\n\nFor Trump this polling milestone comes less than one month after reports first surfaced of a Ukraine whistleblower and roughly three weeks after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the start of a formal impeachment inquiry \u2014 meaning that it represents a historical milestone as well.\n\nTrump hasn\u2019t just crossed the 50 percent threshold on impeachment, peaking at 50.3 percent earlier this week. He\u2019s gotten there faster than Richard Nixon \u2014 and, for that matter, Bill Clinton, who never got there at all.\n\nLet\u2019s rewind. From start to finish, the Watergate scandal took more than two years to unfold. The break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters occurred in June 1972; Nixon was reelected that November; the burglars\u2019 trial began in January 1973; top White House aides resigned in April; a special prosecutor was appointed in May; the Saturday Night Massacre went down in October; formal impeachment proceedings began in May 1974; the House Judiciary Committee passed articles of impeachment in July; and Nixon resigned in August.\n\nPhoto: Win McNamee/Getty Images More\n\nBut for the vast majority of that time, public support never passed the 50 percent mark. In June 1973, right after the Senate Watergate Committee launched televised hearings, only 19 percent of Americans told Gallup that Nixon should be impeached and removed from office. By November, after the Saturday Night Massacre, that number had ticked up to 38 percent. But it wasn\u2019t until August of the following year \u2014 after articles of impeachment had been approved and after the Supreme Court forced Nixon to release the transcript of a \u201csmoking gun\u201d tape that showed he had helped orchestrate the cover-up \u2014 that a majority of Americans came around to the view that he should be impeached and removed.\n\nIn other words, if you start the clock with the Senate hearings, it took 14 months for Nixon to get where Trump has gotten in one. Start with formal impeachment proceedings \u2014 which began three months before support for Nixon\u2019s impeachment breached 50 percent \u2014 and Trump still outpaces his ignominious predecessor by some distance.\n\nThe contest with Clinton, meanwhile, isn\u2019t even close. In early 1998, Clinton denied that he\u2019d had a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, both publicly and in a sworn deposition; in August he admitted that he\u2019d lied; in September independent counsel Kenneth Starr released a report accusing Clinton of committing perjury and trying to influence witnesses to hide the affair; in October the House Judiciary Committee launched a formal impeachment inquiry; in December the House approved two articles of impeachment against Clinton; and in February 1999 the Senate rejected both articles, acquitting the president.\n\nThroughout that entire process, however, public sentiment barely budged: Polls consistently showed that only a quarter to a third of Americans favored Clinton\u2019s impeachment. The highest that number ever got \u2014 retrospectively, in late 1999 \u2014 was 44 percent, which is still 5 to 6 percentage points lower than Trump\u2019s number today.", "description": "President Trump hasn\u2019t just crossed the 50 percent threshold on impeachment, peaking at 50.3 percent earlier this week.
