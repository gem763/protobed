The department, in Pleasanton, Calif., posted a fake outage map on Facebook, with the entire state scribbled out in red.\n\n\u201cRemain calm,\u201d the post read. \u201cUse your cellphone light to search frantically for the one flashlight you think you have in the house. It will be dead of course. Search for batteries.\u201d\n\nOthers did not appear to share their sense of humor. California Highway Patrol said that it was investigating a report that a PG&E vehicle had been shot at in Colusa County, north of Sacramento.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday that residents in the blackout areas had a right to be \u201coutraged.\u201d\n\nBut he stopped short of criticizing PG&E for the shut down.\n\n\u201cThis is industry best practice,\u201d he said of the decision to cut electricity. \u201cThis is just at a scale that we haven\u2019t seen.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who was speaking with reporters, said the state needed to do everything it could to avoid a recurrence of last year\u2019s Camp fire, which killed 86 people.\n\nThere are still weeks left in fire season, he said.\n\n\u201cRemember, we are in the peak of it.\u201d\n\nQuick, charge the Tesla.\n\nBefore the power went out on Wednesday, lines grew at gas stations across the Bay Area. And this being California, a queue had also formed at a row of Tesla superchargers in downtown Los Gatos.", "description": "The second phase of a safety plan intended to prevent wildfires left hundreds of thousands more without electricity.", "authors": ["Thomas Fuller"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/10/world/10blackout-briefing-1/10blackout-briefing-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
