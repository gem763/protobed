But there was Mr. Rees-Mogg, nicknamed \u201cthe honorable gentleman from the 18th century\u201d for his old-world tics and antiquarian poshness, looking like a Degas model, with his willowy frame and long, angular face.\n\nHis legs were crossed. His midsection, wrapped in a double-breasted suit, was nearly flush with the green leather bench. He clasped his hands and tipped back his head.", "description": "Mr. Rees-Mogg, the House of Commons leader, reclined on Parliament\u2019s front benches during Tuesday\u2019s debates, offering a target for the prime minister\u2019s foes and inspiring internet memes.", "authors": ["Benjamin Mueller"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/04/world/04rees-mogg2/04rees-mogg2-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
