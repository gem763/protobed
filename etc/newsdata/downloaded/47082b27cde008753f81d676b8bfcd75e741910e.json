REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson More\n\nA coalition of companies that oppose the law, set to become effective January 1, including Lyft, Uber, DoorDash, and Postmates, has been working with elected officials and labor leaders to find an alternative to the law\u2019s full application.\n\nLyft, along with Uber and DoorDash, have each committed $30 million to a would-be $90 million fund to launch a ballot initiative, should an agreement fail to be reached before January 1.\n\nFlexible hours \u2018extremely important\u2019\n\nIn negotiations, Lyft says it offered drivers alternatives to AB5. Under its proposed terms, California drivers would be the first to receive a net earnings guarantee of at least 32% above local minimum wage, as well as expense reimbursement, ensuring at least $21 per booked hour.\n\nIn addition, Lyft offered to establish legislation permitting workers to form a labor union, plus establish a benefits fund, which could include protection for injured workers. The company says it also offered paid sick leave and paid family leave for drivers who spend in excess of 20 hours per week in booked rides, though it did not specify what additional requirements would apply to drivers who elect to have injured worker and paid leave benefits.\n\nLyft stresses that it would have as many as 300,000 fewer drivers in California if it were required to classify drivers as employees because employee-drivers would be slated to work in scheduled shifts. According to the company, 77% of drivers identify flexible hours as \u201cextremely important.\u201d\n\nFor Uber\u2019s part, the company has said, despite the law, it plans to continue treating drivers as independent contractors, and may have success challenging it.\n\nYahoo Finance contacted Uber for a response to Newsom\u2019s signature on the bill, and did not receive an immediate response.\n\nShares of Uber at market close Wednesday were mostly flat. Lyft shares ended the day down 3%.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a reporter for Yahoo Finance and former litigation attorney.
