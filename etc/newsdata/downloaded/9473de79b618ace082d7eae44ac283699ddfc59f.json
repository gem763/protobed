Your stories remind us why this is all worth it\".\n\n\"This is not about me, though. This is about all of us. I am just overwhelmed that a sign that started as a joke will end up making such a meaningful impact for years to come.\"\n\n\"Our society can be so divisive at times,\" his letter continued.\n\n\"But these two weeks have shown we have the power to come together to make a difference. I hope this can be an inspiration for all of us going forward.\"", "description": "The Des Moines Register has been forced to hire extra security for its newsroom due to threats.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17EEE/production/_109003089_cap324234ture.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
