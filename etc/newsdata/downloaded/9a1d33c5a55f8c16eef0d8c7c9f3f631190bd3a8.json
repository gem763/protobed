China first overtook Japan as the world's second largest economy in the latter months of 2010.\n\nJapan has held the second position in terms of funding quotes, and therefore voting rights, since 1992. However, its proportion of funding has slipped to 6.46% from 6.56%. China's contribution has jumped to 6.39% from 4%, rising from sixth to third place.
