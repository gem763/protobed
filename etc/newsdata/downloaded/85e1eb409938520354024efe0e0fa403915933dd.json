The pair ended the week up for the 7th out of 8 trading days. The latest economic reports beat expectations with rising 0.4% in August, which was double expectations. also improved with the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index rising to 92 from 90.8.\n\nAccording to , the market completely discounted a quarter point rate cut and sees a 70% chance of a second move before the end of the year. Interestingly enough, these odds shifted lower over the past week because prior to that the market was pricing in a 100% chance of two rate cuts before the end of the year.
