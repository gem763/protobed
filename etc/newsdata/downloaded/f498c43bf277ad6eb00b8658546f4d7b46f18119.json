Ironically and problematically, the DOJ filed its denial of delay tactics some four and a half hours after a deadline drawn by a federal judge.\n\n(Note: a nearly five-hour-late submission might, in some quarters, be considered a \u201cdelay.\u201d We\u2019re just saying.)\n\nBecause of the \u2014 ahem \u2014 \u201cdelay\u201d \u2014 the federal government also filed a letter with the judge requesting a post-facto four-hour and 30-minute deadline extension, saying DOJ attorneys were unable to file on time \u201cdespite [their] best efforts.\u201d The request for the extension makes clear that federal and local court rules do not favor extensions, but begs for mercy anyways.\n\nWhile you were sleeping\u2026@TheJusticeDept filed a memo opposing sanctions for alleged \u201cdelay and obfuscation\u201d in the citizenship question case in New York. They filed it 4 hours, 28 minutes after the judge\u2019s deadline (4:28 am EDT), seeking a post-facto deadline extension. pic.twitter.com/zcn26dtkx8 \u2014 Adam Klasfeld (@KlasfeldReports) August 3, 2019\n\nThe litigation stems from the Trump Administration\u2019s attempt to add the citizenship question to the 2020 U.S. Census. The United States Supreme Court struck down the question in June, ruling that the government\u2019s stated reasons for adding the question were \u201ccontrived\u201d and contrary to the government\u2019s own analysis. The Trump Administration originally argued that adding the citizenship question would help with enforcement of the Voting Rights Act by further ensuring minority voters were able to exercise their right to vote despite contradictory evidence from the Census Bureau.\n\nFollowing the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, New York State asked federal judge Jesse Furman for two things: (1) new discovery into the administration\u2019s alleged misconduct, and (2) monetary sanctions for the federal government\u2019s \u201cconcerted campaign of delay and obfuscation\u201d during last year\u2019s trial. According to New York\u2019s motion to re-open discovery and impose sanctions, the federal government knowingly provided \u201cfalse or misleading\u201d testimony thereby committing \u201cfraud on the court.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe misconduct was intentional. This is clear from the pattern of Defendants using false and misleading statements and testimony to obstruct Plaintiffs\u2019 from discovering evidence of their true, discriminatory motive,\u201d the motion alleged.\n\n\u201cDefendants\u2019 misconduct was not isolated. It started at the very outset of the case, includes multiple acts of false and misleading statements delivered in testimony, court filings, and communications to Plaintiffs,\u201d attorneys wrote in the motion. \u201cIndeed, Defendants\u2019 misconduct continues through the present day as Defendants have never attempted to correct the record and continue to deny the existence of any misstatement of fact.\u201d\n\nAlthough a few hours late, the federal government\u2019s latest court filing strongly challenged New York\u2019s allegations, which the DOJ deemed as \u201cbaseless.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs now seek sanctions against the Government based on a web of speculation that is no more plausible, credible, or grounded in actual evidence than the theories they offered in their original sanctions motion several months ago,\u201d the U.S. DOJ argued.\n\n\u201cFar from advancing a clear case of Government misconduct, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion traffics in speculation and innuendo, accompanied by a series of mischaracterizations of what the record actually shows.\u201d\n\nThe federal government also disregarded any notion that Trump Administration officials had engaged in a concerted effort to withhold the truth from the court.\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 assertion of a broad inter-agency conspiracy \u2014 involving countless public officials in multiple components of different federal agencies \u2014 to withhold evidence, frustrate discovery, and mislead the Court in these proceedings, is baseless. Defendants vigorously contested Plaintiffs\u2019 claims during the course of the litigation, but they did so ethically and appropriately,\u201d the federal government wrote.\n\n[Image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images.]", "description": "New York State accused the DOJ of delay tactics in litigation surrounding a citizenship question on the 2020 Census.
