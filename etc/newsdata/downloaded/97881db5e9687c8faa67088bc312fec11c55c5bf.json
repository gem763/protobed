Solis)\n\nThe rate of U.S. home price increases rose in August, reversing a 16-month slowdown.\n\nStandard & Poor\u2019s said Tuesday that its S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index posted a 3.2% annual gain in August, up from 3.1% in the previous month. The increase ends a 16-month deceleration in price growth. Last month, the 20-City Composite posted a 2% annual gain, unchanged from July and below analysts\u2019 estimates of a 2.1% gain.\n\n\u201cThe trend remained intact with a year-over-year price change,\u201d said Philip Murphy, managing director and global head of index governance at S&P Dow Jones Indices, in a press statement.\n\nThe results follow weak sales activity data \u2014 existing and new home sales declined in September. Last week, the National Association of Realtors said existing home sales fell 2.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.38 million units in September, reversing two straight months of gains. Meanwhile, new home sales dipped 0.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 701,000 units \u2014 meeting expectations and in line with August's sales pace, which was revised down to 706,000 units from the previously reported 713,000 units, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.\n\nSeparately, on Tuesday the NAR reported that pending home sales, a leading indicator of the health of the housing market, rose 1.5% in September, increasing for the second straight month. The results beat analysts\u2019 expectations of a 1% increase.\n\n\u201cEven though home prices are rising faster than income, national buying power has increased by 6% because of better interest rates,\u201d said Lawrence Yun, NAR\u2019s chief economist in a press statement. \u201cFurthermore, we\u2019ve seen increased foot traffic as more buyers are evidently eager searching to become homeowners.\u201d\n\nRegional shift\n\nPhoenix led the 20-City Composite for the third straight month, posting the fastest annual home price gain of 6.3%. It was followed by Charlotte, N.C., which posted a 4.5% increase and Tampa, which posted a 4.3% increase.\n\nMeanwhile, Las Vegas which has led the 20-City Composite until it was unseated by Phoenix in June, fell to No. 8 among the cities, posting just a 3.3% annual gain in home prices in August. Amazon\u2019s home state Seattle finally turned positive, posting a 0.7% gain \u201cafter three consecutive months of negative yOY price changes.\u201d\n\n\u201cA shift in regional leadership may be underway beneath the headline national index,\u201d said Murphy. \u201cThe Southeast region included three of the top four cities. Charlotte, Tampa, and Atlanta all recorded solid YOY performance with price changes of 4.5%, 4.3%, and 4.0%, respectively.\u201d\n\nAmanda Fung is an editor at Yahoo Finance.\n\nRead more:\n\n\n\nWhy mortgage delinquencies are at a 12-year low\n\nUS home price growth unchanged after 15-month slowdown\n\nLow interest rates are giving the housing market a boost\n\nHere are 10 U.S. cities where homebuyers have an advantage over sellers\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Home prices in the U.S. rose for the first time in 16 months, according to the latest S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index.", "authors": ["Amanda Fung"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/va_S8fQPZIWRok5sAUwSGg--~B/aD0yOTMwO3c9NTEwNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/85ee8f20-fa37-11e9-addd-54fdc7d3e3fb", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
