The property includes a large barn that holds both a private squash gym and an attractive indoor garage space for his race cars.\n\nThe 14,873-square-foot villa has a fa\u00e7ade of limestone and stucco with both traditional and more modern Palladian details.\n\nOther architectural highlights include a grand two-story foyer with a dual floating circular staircase, stone and hardwood floors, cathedral and beamed ceilings, multiple wood-burning fireplaces, and a Palladian window in the master bedroom.\n\nThe kitchen features an oversized island, a commercial stove and an informal dining area with a large table and a fireplace with an oversized granite hearth.\n\nThe property is \"extremely private, with a driveway that\u2019s a mile long,\" Mr. Goldspiel said. \"It\u2019s beautifully sited.\"\n\n\"You\u2019ve got the best of both worlds here,\" he said. \"It\u2019s large but it\u2019s intimate.\"\n\nIt\u2019s also a \"really fun property,\" Mr. Goldspiel said. \"It\u2019s got trails throughout the property and there\u2019s a stream and a pond and old back roads that you can drive on.\"\n\nMore: A Waterfront House in Connecticut Comes With Four Lots\n\nStats\n\nThe 14,873-square-foot house has five bedrooms, four full bathrooms and four partial bathrooms.

It\u2019s also close to the town of Kent, in Putnam County, New York.\n\nFor rail commuters to New York, it\u2019s about a 30-minute drive to the closest Metro-North Commuter Railroad station, which services Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan, he said.\n\nAgents: Ira Goldspiel and Steve Pener, William Pitt/Julia B Fee Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\n\nView the original listing.
