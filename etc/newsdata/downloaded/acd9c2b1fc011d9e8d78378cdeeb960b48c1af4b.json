The pink scars from his breast removal surgery crossed his chest like war paint. \u201cWe exist. There are others like me and we are searching for a path in fashion.\u201d\n\nMore transgender people are killed in Brazil than anywhere else in the world, and discrimination is rampant. Last year the country elected a socially conservative president partial to antigay rhetoric. Now the fashion community is emerging as a center of the LGBT resistance.\n\nIn 2016, Brazil launched the world\u2019s most famous transgender model, Valentina Sampaio. She became the first transgender model hired by Victoria\u2019s Secret, and the first featured on a cover of Vogue.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSampaio followed the path blazed by Leandra Medeiros Cerezo, known as Lea T, the Brazilian transgender model who was the face of French luxury fashion brand Givenchy in the early 2010s.\n\nBut as Brazil\u2019s transgender models have attained success abroad, life for the trans community back home has grown worse.\n\nAn astounding 41 percent of documented killings of transgender people worldwide take place in Brazil, according to the country\u2019s National Association of Transvestites and Transsexuals. At least 163 trans people were killed last year. Life expectancy for transgender people here is 35, half the national average.\n\nViolence against the LGBT community rose last year as fringe politician Jair Bolsonaro campaigned for president. The father of five said he would rather a son die in an accident than be gay. It did not stop Brazilians from electing him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDuring Bolsonaro\u2019s first week in office, his minister of women, family and human rights said that from now on \u201cboys will wear blue and girls will wear pink.\u201d\n\nThe pronouncement drew outcry and ridicule, but the fashion community saw it as a challenge. At Rock Management, a modeling agency in Sao Paulo, the election sparked an all-hands meeting.\n\n\u201cWe said, either we accept this political situation and show only white men,\u201d said 25-year-old Clara Vieira, a booking agent at Rock. \u201cOr we say, \u2018No, honey, we are going to show trans, blacks, plus-size models.\u2019\n\n\u201cKeeping our head down was not an option.\u201d\n\nThe agency tried to expand its \u201cfreestyle\u201d department, focused on alternative looks: Models with tattoos, dyed hair and curvy bodies. But founder Clovis Pessoa, 46, quickly saw there were limits to what the fashion world would accept.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou still need to have a perfect body, long legs and a short torso,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a standard shape that fashion requires.\u201d\n\nPorto, at six feet tall with an angular jaw and narrow frame, fit the bill. One year past his gender transformation surgery, he was eager to break into fashion \u2014 and not as a man, but as a transgender model. In his portfolio, he included a photo of himself topless to show his scars.\n\nPessoa took Porto in. The two would pace the agency\u2019s small office for hours as Pessoa offered guidance: Keep your head up and your chin back. Porto sometimes hunched as he walked, Pessoa said, as if he still had to carry breasts in front of him.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cImagine you are a puppet and there is a line pulling you up,\u201d he advised. \u201cI want you to gain height and presence.\u201d\n\nAfter a month of catwalk practice, Porto was ready for casting. In a whitewashed room thick with cologne and anxiety, six male models sat on a leather couch, looking nearly identical in tight pants, gold rings and piercings, waiting to be seen.\n\nAlexandre Queiroz is casting director of the Brazilian fashion label Ellus. When he saw Porto, he was sold.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe is beautiful,\u201d Queiroz said. But it was more than his looks. Gone were the days, Queiroz said, when consumers demanded perfection. The modern audience wanted a model with personality \u2014 someone who was fighting for something.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere was a time when brands were scared that the final consumer wouldn\u2019t understand,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we live in a country where homophobia kills. We can\u2019t be scared. Back in the day, it could have bothered me. But now it is a fight.\u201d\n\nPorto got that gig, and eight others \u2014 the most shows for any model this season. Brands wanted him because he was trans, not despite it. He was rarely the only trans model in a show.\n\nAt the end of one appearance, Sao Paulo Fashion Week founder Paulo Borges pulled him aside. \u201cMy god, you\u2019re gorgeous,\u201d Borges told him. \u201cI want to see more of you.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFor some \u2014 particularly black or androgynous trans models \u2014 the climb has been more difficult.\n\nMaria Clara de Melo, 24, a transgender model from southern Brazil, said she decided to sit out Sao Paulo Fashion Week this year because the discrimination she has suffered in previous seasons left her depressed and exhausted. Makeup artists routinely referred to her as \u201chim.\u201d As she was undergoing her transition, she struggled to get gigs.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPeople say that the fashion industry is so accepting, but it isn\u2019t quite like that,\u201d de Melo said. She decided to try her luck abroad in Paris or Milan. \u201cTo be a successful Brazilian trans model, you have to have a career outside the country first. Then people here will value you.\u201d\n\nWhatever strides the fashion industry has made toward embracing transgender people, some say it took too long. Neon Cunha is a transgender producer for designer Isaac Silva. The brand included three black transgender models in its debut show this year.\n\n\u201cI see there is a concern this season about bringing in new faces, new voices, to make fashion that has a sociopolitical thought process,\u201d Cunha said. \u201cBut nobody asks, where has this vacuum been for 21 years? How long does it take to have a designer like Isaac?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis year, inclusivity was the explicit theme of several shows. Cavalera, a Brazilian brand known for its urban street style, chose Porto to close the runway.\n\nOther male models wore colorful eyeliner and lipstick, but Porto\u2019s face was blank, save for three black tears under one eye \u2014 symbolic of the country\u2019s trans murder rate.\n\nAs he reached the end of the runway, he slowly unzipped his vest and knelt before the flashing cameras. Under his scars, a clear message was scrawled in black across his abdomen: \u201cTrans respect.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The country kills more transgender people than anywhere in the world.\u00a0Now the industry is taking a stand.", "authors": ["Marina Lopes"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/UdIULMywUSuXpL_ERiLZyoUQiq4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XFVXNKXWTMI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
