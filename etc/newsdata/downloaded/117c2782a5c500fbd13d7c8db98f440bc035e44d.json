She started to cry.\n\nFor two full minutes\u2014a length of time, it should be said, that is longer than you think\u2014the audience delivered a standing ovation, whistling and screaming and cheering as Zellweger, wearing a sleek powder blue dress, made her way in front of them, her hand over her heart in shock. The crowd only relented when, after hurriedly wiping tears from her cheeks, she tapped the microphone and humbly scolded: \u201cY\u2019all better quit it. You\u2019re messing up my makeup!\u201d\n\nThe film, out Sept. 27, chronicles Judy Garland\u2019s tumultuous time performing a run of sold-out concerts at London\u2019s famed Talk of the Town. It\u2019s a time defined by the highs of a comeback and the vindication of her talents, and the lows of depression, insomnia, and substance abuse. Garland wouldn\u2019t make it to the end of the year. She died of an overdose in June 1969 at the age of 47.\n\nNEWSLETTERS The Daily Beast\u2019s Obsessed Everything we can\u2019t stop loving, hating, and thinking about this week in pop culture.

Coming back from that to play Judy Garland, of all fixtures and icons, is the kind of big swing that can\u2019t be oversold.\n\nYet as the rapturous reception\u2014at TIFF, in reviews, from this journalist\u2014attests, she defies all expectations, no matter how high or low. It\u2019s the kind of performance\u2014not a mimic, but an embodiment\u2014that leaves you completely breathless. Survival instinct kicks in. You must cry; with the tears come more oxygen.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know how to take that,\u201d Zellweger says when we meet a few days before Judy hits theaters. The experience at TIFF was overwhelming, to the point that even now, weeks later, she seems triggered back into astonishment. \u201cOur intention was to celebrate her. I was just so happy that it seemed like we had gotten it right.\u201d\n\nZellweger has just arrived in New York to begin her dutiful press blitz in support of the film. While early yet, she has already received the ecstatic pronouncement, from those in the industry who do such pronouncing, that she will likely earn her second Oscar for her performance. It\u2019s a hell of a way to be thrust back into the harsh glare of the spotlight: as Judy Garland at the start of a long Best Actress campaign.\n\nInterviews thus far have covered the gamut, from the fascination over the technicalities\u2014how, exactly, did Zellweger get her voice, her posture, and her very being to so cannily resemble Garland?\u2014to the more uncouth fascination over her 10-year absence: What demons was she fighting? Why did she need such a break? What about the crass headlines over her appearance?\n\n\u201cIt does feel very different this time around,\u201d she says.\n\nIt\u2019s an adjustment to be back doing press, back on the red carpet, back to being vulnerable, and back to all that entails being a major lead actress on a media tour.\n\n\u201cHaving stepped away from that for a little while, I have a new perspective and I have different boundaries. A person without boundaries is, I would probably say, less authentic or comfortable in any exchange. So it\u2019s a bit of a happier experience this go-round.\u201d After a beat, she repeats herself. \u201cIt\u2019s happier.\u201d\n\nShe greets me in the lobby of the Bowery Hotel, which she fawns over as she nestles into a large, velvet chair. She\u2019s been coming here since it was new, she says, \u201clike a thousand years ago,\u201d when it was a music venue. \u201cOh, I have great memories here\u2026\u201d she goes on, smirking and bashfully burying her head in her shoulder, as if afraid of the stories she\u2019d tell.\n\nIn a way that for some reason seems remarkable, Zellweger appears to be very comfortable. Maybe it\u2019s projection because of all the stories about her\u2014she has more to say about that\u2014or maybe it\u2019s because I last saw her as Garland in the throes of a nervous breakdown. Either way, it is somehow refreshing.\n\nShe greets me dressed in a long-sleeved henley shirt and loose cargo pants, fully made up, with her hair styled in a dramatic, Dolly Parton bouffant. She\u2019s a Texas girl, something that seems to lead her personality, whether it\u2019s the instinct to barrel through pleasantries into real conversations\u2014somehow, the first thing we end up talking about is my friend\u2019s wedding\u2014or the twang in her accent which is much more pronounced in person than some may expect.\n\nHer resting position is to cross her legs and fold over, leaning in close to the person she\u2019s talking to\u2014a warring body language that telegraphs someone who\u2019s guarded, but also eager to draw you into their intimate space. Barely speaking above a whisper, she tells me she loves New York City, almost as if she\u2019s sharing a secret.\n\n\u201cI always forget that every now and then you need an infusion of that energy, you know? Just talking to people in the street,\u201d she says, suddenly uncoiling and letting out a startling, loud guffaw. \u201cYou know you\u2019re from out of town when you\u2019re talking to people in the street.\u201d\n\nAt face value, it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that a performer playing Judy Garland is garnering awards attention, especially when they\u2019re chronicling such an explosive period of her life.\n\nJudy Davis and Tammy Blanchard won Emmys for their work in the 2001 miniseries Life With Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows. Tracie Bennett was nominated for a Tony Award for playing Garland in the 2012 play, End of the Rainbow, which serves as the source material for Judy.\n\nYou may think you know what you\u2019re in for when you buy a ticket to the film: the brassiness, the jerking mannerisms, the mania as she pops pills and swills booze. But Zellweger defies all of that by infusing a period of Garland\u2019s life we all associate with tragedy with a dazzling, infectious warmth. It\u2019s a shade of the rainbow, so to speak, we\u2019re not used to seeing when it comes to Garland. For some viewers, it may even be a revelation.\n\nIt fascinated Zellweger that, after Garland passed, people described that period of her life with such darkness.\n\n\u201cThat leaves very little room to consider her humanity,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as the salacious bits of a person\u2019s experience. There\u2019s so much that\u2019s in between the lines, that\u2019s not spoken, that\u2019s not addressed. That changes the truth of the picture and people\u2019s perception in a way that I think is often very unfair. Those omissions are essential to understanding what is truthful to the person\u2019s experience.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say she\u2019s speaking from a place of authority. The omissions, what we didn\u2019t know, are very much a part of Zellweger\u2019s own story.\n\n\u201c There\u2019s so much that\u2019s in between the lines, that\u2019s not spoken, that\u2019s not addressed. That changes the truth of the picture and people\u2019s perception in a way that I think is often very unfair. \u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a story we\u2019ve all been rather obsessed with, even during her self-imposed exile. She attained a level of celebrity that kicked off with a rocket launch after 1996\u2019s Jerry Maguire\u2014she had us at hello\u2014and burnt fuel in the stratosphere for more than a decade: the Bridget Jones movies, Chicago, Cold Mountain, Nurse Betty.\n\nLife entailed running from film sets to photo shoots to red carpets to awards podiums and back again, a kind of merry-go-round. Except, instead of whimsical music tinkling in the background, people shout demands and criticisms of everything from your performances to your looks. After a string of misfires and misses in the early 2010s, the carousel finally slowed and Zellweger took the opportunity to step away.\n\nA chance to breathe meant a chance to realize how unhealthy she had been, and how neglectful she was of her personal well-being. She started to see a therapist, who helped her realize she was depressed.\n\nThere was a path to self-healing afforded by a return to relative anonymity, now that every day of her schedule wasn\u2019t planned two years in advance. She could travel. She took classes in international policy at a university in Los Angeles.\n\nIt was an opportunity to recalibrate on her own terms, an opportunity that was nearly crushed by an anvil after a rare public appearance she made at 2014\u2019s Elle Women in Hollywood Awards.\n\nThe crudest savagery of the media rose up ravenously, as commentary about her face, which critics wondered had been altered through plastic surgery, drove up page views and magazine sales. She addressed it all in an essay for HuffPost titled, \u201cWe Can Do Better.\u201d\n\nShe speaks about the whole experience again in a New York magazine profile, first laughing, \u201cNothing like international humiliation to set your perspective right!\u201d But then she wonders what the cost is of this scrutiny: \u201cThe implication that I somehow needed to change what was going on because it wasn\u2019t working. That makes me sad. I don\u2019t look at beauty in that way. And I don\u2019t think of myself in that way. I like my weird quirkiness, my off-kilter mix of things. It enables me to do what I do.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no reason to gossip about it more here, except that it is the question I\u2019ve been asked most by friends and colleagues who knew I was meeting Zellweger. She looked great: extremely pretty, very youthful, and palpably happy.\n\nHer eyes sparkled through that squint as we talked. She\u2019s in constant, lively motion, like embers crackling off a fire. In this case, that fire is the barn-burner of a performance she gives in Judy.\n\nIt\u2019s a reflex of the media to construct a narrative when it comes to major cultural moments like this. With Judy, that\u2019s meant drawing parallels between what Garland was going through during that time in her career and Zellweger\u2019s own journey these past 10 years.\n\nWhen I ask her what she thinks of those comparisons, she crosses her hands on her legs and leans forward. \u201cWell, I haven\u2019t read anything, so I don\u2019t specifically know what you\u2019re referring to.\u201d\n\n\u201c That makes me sad. I don\u2019t look at beauty in that way. And I don\u2019t think of myself in that way. I like my weird quirkiness, my off-kilter mix of things. \u201d\n\nIn my head, I go through the examples I\u2019ve read: that they\u2019re performers who took hard hits from an industry that expected too much of them and treated them unfairly; that critics felt entitled to scrutinize and belittle them as if they weren\u2019t real people; that at moments when each was discounted, they triumphed with resilience. Would she like me to tell her about these, for context?\n\nWith a sense of comedic timing that could only be ascribed to a summoning of Garland herself, she deadpans, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nLaughter explodes from her with such a volcanic force, the chandeliers hanging at the Bowery Hotel nearly melt. She throws her entire body back into her chair as she cackles. It\u2019s no giggle, but a loud, throaty, brash laugh.\n\nIt\u2019s like when her friends text her to alert her to something they read about her and she deletes the message before finishing the first sentence. \u201cI\u2019ve got plenty of reasons not to sleep at night,\u201d she says. \u201cThat does not need to be one of them. And believe me, I will punish myself plenty about the choices I\u2019ve made or don\u2019t make. You don\u2019t even know.\u201d\n\nShe lets out that familiar sigh of someone who has nearly exhausted themselves in a fit of laughter, finally calmed down. \u201cBut I can imagine that there are certain things that I might be able to empathize with in a more substantial way than I might have earlier in my life.\u201d\n\nThe most striking commentary that Judy makes about celebrity is the loneliness one feels amidst all that fame.\n\nFor all the people who are watching you, who buy tickets to your show, and who surround you to make sure you get from point A to point B, it just seems so isolating.\n\nZellweger\u2019s Garland portrays that to heartbreaking effect. A mother missing her kids. A woman starved for love who enters yet another unhappy marriage. A celebrity so in need of human interaction that, in the film\u2019s tenderest scene, she asks two gay fans to join her for dinner after a concert. Did Zellweger identify with that?\n\n\u201cI understand other people's projections and assumptions, I know that,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I understand that as a person\u2019s persona gets bigger, it takes up more space and it becomes more difficult to have authentic exchanges with people. Because they don\u2019t really meet you. They meet a projection of you.\u201d\n\nShe knows she\u2019s not alone in feeling that way. \u201cIt\u2019s universal. You look at Janis Joplin, who I always assumed desperately wanted to be seen and wanted to be enough. I thought the irony was that the bigger her star grew, the bigger the shadow she stood in. It\u2019s a hard thing, I guess.\u201d\n\nThe goal of the movie was for Judy Garland to be seen as a full person, not to be defined by the troubles and tribulations that make up a juicy story and the stuff of legend. Through her performance as Garland, that\u2019s now what we\u2019re witnessing with Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, too.\n\nWe\u2019re back to talking about all that crying that happens at the end of the film. In the last scene, Zellweger as Judy performs a gutting rendition of \u201cSomewhere Over the Rainbow\u201d on the final night of Garland\u2019s Talk of the Town dates.\n\nGarland is so overcome by emotion she can barely get out the notes through her quivering throat, so the audience joins her in a singalong. She stands in shell-shocked tears as she takes in the ovation\u2014an incredible art imitating life moment when one considers Zellweger\u2019s own experience at TIFF. \u201cDon\u2019t forget me,\u201d Garland says. \u201cPromise me you won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nOne can\u2019t possibly imagine what it must be like to sing \u201cSomewhere Over the Rainbow\u201d in those circumstances, with that much emotional weight behind it, with that audience, and, for the love of Liza, dressed as Judy Garland, to boot. What must that be like?\n\nZellweger takes in a breath so deep it\u2019s as if she\u2019s imbibing all the air of Manhattan, clutching her chest and relaxing into a serene smile. \u201cProbably just what you imagine,\u201d she says.\n\nThe performance was filmed on the last of five days of shooting the movie\u2019s musical numbers. In between takes, the extras in the audience would share stories about and memories of Garland. Some had seen her perform themselves. Each time Zellweger would sing the song, she would combust with emotion, thinking about what it must have meant to Garland, and what it must have taken to maintain what may have seemed like an unattainable optimism.\n\nI tell her it sounds like an amazing experience. \u201cWell,\u201d she says, flitting her eyes to the side like she\u2019s about to deliver a bawdy dare, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you try it some time?\u201d\n\nWe both collapse in laughter again. She says never wants to stop talking about what it was like to perform that song. It\u2019s a kind of vibrancy and genuine appreciation I can\u2019t recall ever seeing while interviewing an actor this famous. Maybe this isn\u2019t a comeback, I think, in that it\u2019s not a return at all. Maybe it\u2019s someone finally living the way she was meant to.\n\n\u201cThat moment, it was like the seal on the love letter,\u201d she says. \u201cShe never quit. She never gave up.\u201d", "description": "After the harsh scrutiny and demands of Hollywood sent Zellweger into exile, playing Judy Garland is a hell of a way to return to the spotlight.
