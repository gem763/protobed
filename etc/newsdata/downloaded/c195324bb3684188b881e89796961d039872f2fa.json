I\u2019ve not seen signs of weakness ... to be worried about. He is a top-class defender. If now he gets to play games, things will sort themselves out, no doubt,\u201d Kompany said.", "description": "Manchester City defender John Stones needs to show consistency of form and fitness to silence critics and establish himself as the first-choice centre back for the Premier League champions, former club captain, Vincent Kompany, has said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429378132&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0NQ", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
