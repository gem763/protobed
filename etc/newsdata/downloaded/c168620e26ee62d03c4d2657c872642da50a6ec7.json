Here\u2019s What They Said", "language": "en", "text": "Democratic senators on Capitol Hill had mixed responses \u2014 from saying it\u2019s a woman\u2019s choice to dodging the question altogether \u2014 about whether they were comfortable with calling abortion immoral in any circumstance.\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation asked nearly 10 Democratic senators about abortion and if there was a point at which it would be considered immoral Tuesday and Wednesday after the Republican-led Senate failed to pass a bill, which would mandate medical care and legal protections to infants born alive after an attempted abortion. Doctors who don\u2019t comply would be punished.\n\nRepublicans were only able to get three Democrats to vote in favor, crossing party lines to vote for the bill, while three Republican lawmakers did not vote. Republicans were seven votes short of passing the bill, in what President Donald Trump called \u201cone of the most shocking votes in the history of Congress.\u201d\n\nDemocratic California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 hopeful who voted against Republican Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse\u2019s bill, would not say if abortion was ever immoral.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s up to a woman to make that decision, and I will always stand by that,\u201d she told TheDCNF. \u201cI think she needs to make that decision with her doctor, with her priest, with her spouse. I would leave that decision up to them.\u201d\n\nSIGN THE PETITION: Stop Infanticide! Stop Abortions Up to Birth!\n\nOther Democratic senators gave similar responses, like Delaware Sen. Chris Coons.\n\n\u201cI, nor frankly anyone in my caucus, is pro-abortion. But I think the decision when and under what circumstances to terminate a pregnancy is something best left to a woman, her doctor, and her minister or family,\u201d Coons told TheDCNF. \u201cI don\u2019t think infanticide is and was illegal, and I didn\u2019t think the vote last night advanced that issue one bit.\u201d\n\nMany Democratic senators refused to answer the question, such as Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono, who also voted against the bill, and Alabama Sen. Doug Jones, who was one of three Democrats to vote in favor of Sasse\u2019s bill. Hirono refused to acknowledge the question and a member of her staff told TheDCNF \u201cwe don\u2019t talk to you, I don\u2019t know why you keep asking.\u201d\n\nJones told TheDCNF he is \u201cnot going to answer abortion questions,\u201d saying, \u201cI\u2019m just not going to answer. You can talk to my communications director.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Connecticut Sen. Dick Blumenthal responded to a question about whether abortion could in any way be immoral.\n\n\u201cI have to think about that.\u201d\n\nWhen TheDCNF reminded Blumenthal he voted in favor of a bill that supports abortion, he said, \u201clet me think about that and I\u2019ll get back to you. Do you have a card?\u201d\n\nTheDCNF ran into Blumenthal on Wednesday and reminded him of the question, asking if he had thought about it.\n\n\u201cI can think of instances where it might be,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, if it is performed with criminal intent. If there is criminal intent or, in fact, intent to harm another person, I can see how that might be immoral.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine was the only Democrat asked who said there were cases in which abortion could be immoral, saying he has \u201csupported all kinds of regulations that I think are completely consistent with Roe v. Wade. So, yeah \u2014 many over the course of my career.\u201d\n\nHowever, he did not vote in favor of Sasse\u2019s bill Monday night.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a 2020 hopeful, ran away from TheDCNF\u2019s question Wednesday, sprinting down Senate escalators and into the Senate subway, while refusing to answer the question as the subway doors closed.\n\n\u201cThe Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don\u2019t mind executing babies AFTER birth,\u201d Trump said Monday.\n\nLifeNews Note: Henry Rodgers writes for Daily Caller.
