He previously referred to Mr. Trump on the Senate floor as a \u201cspoiled brat,\u201d \u201ca con artist\u201d and a \u201chuman leech,\u201d CNN noted.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s, intellectually, a powerhouse, but he is basically a very, very smart man,\u201d Mr. Reid recently told CNN, the network reported. \u201cNo matter what the subject, any argument he involves himself in, it\u2019s on his terms. You\u2019re always arguing against him. He never, never, is willing to debate an issue on terms that aren\u2019t his.\n\n\u201cHe is not going to be a pushover,\u201d Mr. Reid added, according to CNN. \u201cHe is a very untruthful man who a lot of people acknowledge and accept everything he says, and so don\u2019t think that Donald Trump is a pushover. That\u2019s the first thing people need to understand.\u201d\n\nMore than a dozen candidates are currently seeking the Democratic nomination to run against Mr. Trump in 2020, including current front-runners former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, among others.\n\nThe results of a recent nationwide Fox News poll released this week found each of the three Democratic front-runners beating Mr. Trump in a hypothetical head-to-head contest.\n\nMr. Reid was interviewed by CNN host and Democratic strategist David Axelrod. The segment is set to air Saturday evening.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
