[WARNER BROS. PICTURES]\n\nAs expected, \u201cJoker\u201d had a big debut at the local box office thanks to enthusiastic fans who waited a long time to see the acclaimed film that won the Golden Lion at the 2019 Venice International Film Festival.The psychological thriller drew 1.3 million people to 1,418 screens over its first weekend and shot straight to the top spot. Overall, the film has sold a total of 2.2 million tickets since its release on Oct. 2. Played by award-winning actor Joaquin Phoenix, many local moviegoers have applauded the actor\u2019s convincing portrayal of his transition from the social outcast Arthur Fleck to the Joker, with critics commenting that they \u201cgot goose bumps\u201d seeing his performance. Director Todd Phillips described Phoenix\u2019s performance as \u201ctranscendent\u201d during a live conference held with local press that took place last month.Local romantic comedy \u201cCrazy Romance\u201d took the second spot in its first weekend, gathering 625,000 moviegoers to 1,069 screens. The story revolves around Sun-young (played by Gong Hyo-jin) and Jae-hoon (played by Kim Rae-won) who meet while they are suffering from the aftermath of each own\u2019s breakup. Although the film was overshadowed by the local premiere of \u201cJoker,\u201d reviews are overwhelmingly positive. Moviegoers who\u2019d seen the film unanimously agreed that the film depicts a brutal, yet overwhelmingly realistic side of romance between two people.Local comedy \u201cMan of Men\u201d debuted in third, selling 325,000 tickets through 803 screens.Featuring well-known actors Seol Kyung-gu and Cho Jin-woong, the film is about Young-gi (played by Cho), a gangster who wants \u201cto have it all\u201d in one go, which is why he foolishly steals 700 million won ($585,000) from his boss to invest it all, hoping that he can reap a fortune. Instead, however, he loses it all and is at risk of losing his life when a coldhearted, but terminally ill law firm CEO named Jang-soo appears in front of him. Jang-soo proposes a deal which would allow Young-gi to acquire his death benefit worth 12 million won if Young-gi helps him strike things off of his bucket list for two months. Young-gi believes that this is the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to have everything he has ever dreamed of.The war film \u201cBattle of Jangsari\u201d fell to fourth place against the slew of new releases. The film sold 102,000 tickets at 650 screens.Russian animated film \u201cThe Princess and the Dragon\u201d landed at fifth, attracting 36,000 people to 469 screens. The protagonist, Sophie, embarks on a magical adventure when she comes across an enchanted book and finds herself plunged into the middle of the book\u2019s world.In North America, the filmmakers and studio behind \u201cJoker\u201d have reason to put on a happy face. Despite concerns over its violent themes and ramped up theater security, audiences flocked to the multiplex to check out the film, resulting in a record October opening.Warner Bros. said Sunday that \u201cJoker\u201d grossed an estimated $93.5 million in ticket sales from 4,374 screens in North America. The previous October record holder was the Spider-Man spinoff \u201cVenom\u201d which opened to $80 million last year. Internationally, \u201cJoker\u201d earned $140.5 million from 73 markets, resulting in a stunning $234 million global debut.\u201cThis was a much larger result at the box office than we had ever anticipated globally,\u201d said Jeff Goldstein, Warner Bros. president of domestic distribution. \u201cPutting records aside, we\u2019re just thrilled that audiences are embracing the movie as strong as they are.\u201dThe film from director and co-writer Todd Phillips was always seen as a bit of a gamble with one of the studios\u2019 most valuable pieces of intellectual property, hence its modest-for-a-comic-book-film $55 million budget.But in the weeks leading up to its release, hype and uneasiness intensified beyond how audiences would react to placing this character in a realistic and unambiguously adult setting with \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d undertones. Responding to anxiety that the film might have the potential to inspire violence, multiple theater chains banned costumes or reaffirmed earlier policies regarding masks, and authorities in numerous cities said they were placing police patrols around theaters. Some relatives of the victims of the 2012 Aurora movie theater shooting even asked Warner Bros. to commit to gun control causes - the studio said it always has.While some worried this would impact the box office, it did not ultimately detract audiences from turning out opening weekend; the box office surpassed industry expectations and may rise even higher when weekend actuals are fully reported. Although the film got a B+ CinemaScore from opening night audiences, the studio is optimistic about its long-term playability.\u201cSixty-six percent of the audience was under the age of 35,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cThat tells you that the audience will expand out with that younger group as time goes on.\u201d The younger audience also gave the film a more favorable A- CinemaScore.Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for box office tracker Comscore, said that the convergence of critical acclaim and controversy actually helped the film become bigger than expected at the box office.\u201cIt\u2019s the ultimate water cooler movie right now,\u201d Dergarabedian said.He added that it was important that \u201cJoker\u201d was always marketed as a \u201cvery dark, R-rated film.\u201d\u201cIt always had an element of mystery and danger surrounding it,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cIf it was a G-rated film, controversy like this would not be a good thing.\u201dIn the landscape of R-rated comic book films, \u201cJoker\u201d is nestled between \u201cDeadpool\u201d and its sequel, both of which opened over $125 million, and \u201cLogan,\u201d which launched with $88.4 million.\u201cJoker\u201d was the only new wide release this weekend, which is down from last year when both \u201cVenom\u201d and \u201cA Star is Born\u201d opened. Holdovers populated the top 10: The more family-friendly \u201cAbominable\u201d landed in second place with $12 million in its second weekend, and \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d took third in its third weekend with $8 million.With awards buzz behind it, the Judy Garland biopic \u201cJudy,\u201d starring Renee Zellweger, added nearly 1,000 screens this weekend and placed seventh with $4.5 million from 1,458 locations.And in limited release, Pedro Almodovar\u2019s critically acclaimed \u201cPain and Glory\u201d launched on four screens to a solid $160,087. Less fortunate was the Natalie Portman-led astronaut drama \u201cLucy in the Sky\u201d which earned only $55,000 from 37 theaters resulting in a dismal $1,500 per screen average.BY LEE JAE-LIM, AP [lee.jaelim@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/07194437.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
