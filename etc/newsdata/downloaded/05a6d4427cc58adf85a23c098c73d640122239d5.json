In summer, temperatures can reach 48 degree Celsius.\n\nIt has more than 1.5 million permanent residents, and another 2 million pilgrims journey there each year.\n\nFor more stories, go to Business Insider SA.\n\nMuslim's holiest city is also the world's hottest city.\n\nMecca, in Saudi Arabia, is the warmest inhabited place on earth. Its average annual temperature is 87.3 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius). In summer, temperatures can reach 122 degrees fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius).\n\nThe city is located in Sirat Mountains, inland from the Red Sea.\n\nOn top of the heat, it gets busy. While a little over 1.5 million people live there permanently, more than 2 million pilgrims travel to Mecca annually. Every Muslim, who is able and can afford it, is expected to travel there at least once in their life for the Hajj. Non-Muslims are not allowed to enter Mecca.\n\nFor those who live there year-round, winters are a little more manageable. But it never gets cold.\n\nThese photos show what it's like in the world's hottest inhabited city.\n\nWelcome to Mecca, the world's hottest inhabited place.\n\nIn Mecca, during the summer, between June and September, temperatures can reach 48 degrees Celsius, and the streets get busy.\n\nSources: Weather Spark, Britannica\n\nThe city has about 1.5 million permanent residents, but more than 2 million pilgrims flood into Mecca for six days for the Hajj every year.\n\nSources: Al Arabiya, The National, Al Jazeera\n\nThe main day of the pilgrimage, which requires worship outside from sunrise to sunset, can be particularly trying.\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nThe closest city to Mecca is Jeddah, a seaside port on the Red Sea. It's about 112km away and requires travelling through the desert to get there.\n\nSource: UNESCO\n\nMecca's wild temperatures are due to its location, in a dry valley at the base of the Sirat Mountains ...\n\nSources: Britannica, Seasons of the Year\n\n... surrounded by the Arabian Desert. Its average annual temperature is 30 degree Celsius, but it's a dry heat.\n\nSources: Britannica, Seasons of the Year\n\nThere's very little greenery, as the view from space shows here. The white structure in the middle is the Great Mosque.\n\nSource: Wikimedia\n\nFor the next 10 years, the Hajj will be during the summer.\n\nSources: Al Arabiya, The National\n\nBut the high temperatures are nothing new. Seen here is a pilgrim being given a cold bath to cope with the heat in 1967.\n\nIn 1985, a reported 2,000 people got heat stroke, and more than 1,000 of those people ended up dying.\n\nSource: Vox\n\nDealing with the heat requires preparation. Hotels and some home owners, like the Saudi royalty seen here, have air conditioning.\n\nAnd one of Mecca's cooler spots is around the Kaaba, one of Islam's most holy objects.\n\nSources: Khaleej Times, The National\n\nThe ground near the Kaaba is made from white Thassos marble, which was imported from Greece. It reflects the sun and heat during the day and remains cool even on hot days. The area also has an abundance of air conditioning.\n\nSources: Khaleej Times, The National\n\nBut people have to go outside. It's common for pilgrims to buy lots of water to help them get through the heat later in the day.\n\nSource: The National\n\nFor those who need to be outside in the heat, umbrellas are a must.\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nSome have modified them to limit energy use as much as possible.\n\nOne man has even created a \"smart umbrella,\" which uses solar energy to power a fan to keep the user cool. It also has a flashlight, a USB outlet to charge phones, and a GPS tracker.\n\nSource: Eco-Business\n\nTo keep cool, pilgrims may also eat ice cream.\n\nSource: New York Times\n\nAnd whenever there's time for a break, people keep drinking water.\n\nWater is even sprayed into the mouths of those in need.\n\nSince Mecca is in the desert, even during the evening temperatures only drop to about 84 degrees Fahrenheit (28 degree Celsius).\n\nSources: My Weather 2, Weather and Climate\n\nFor the 1.5 million residents who live there year-round, two of Mecca's main industries are now tourism and construction. Thirteen of 15 of Mecca's old neighbourhoods have been rebuilt for tourism and commerce.\n\nSmaller businesses like tour guides, vegetable sellers, and street vendors are struggling to compete with the newly built fast-food chains and hotels.\n\nSource: The Guardian\n\nDuring the winter, locals can look forward to milder temperatures, with an average high of 30 degrees Celsius, and a low of 18 degree Celsius.\n\nSources: Britannica, My Weather 2\n\nOver the entire year, there is usually fewer than 13 centimetres of rain.\n\nSources: Britannica, My Weather 2\n\nDue to the arid, harsh conditions, wild animals and plants aren't abundant.\n\nOther wild animals in the area include wolves, hyenas, foxes, mongooses, and jerboas. There has also been a surge in monkeys in Mount Al-Noor District since weapons used to shoot them were banned.\n\nSources: Britannica, Al Arabiya\n\nIf carbon emissions continue at their current rate, by 2100, Mecca's maximum temperature could soar to 55 degree Celsius.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nIf it continues to get hotter, the Hajj may become a physically impossible journey due to heat stress.\n\nSource: Wired", "description": "Mecca in Saudi Arabia is the world's hottest inhabited place.
