By reuniting Linda Hamilton, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and James Cameron, the film recreates the magic of Terminator 2: Judgment Day.\n\nThe film takes place 27 years after the events of Terminator 2: Judgement Day. A new, highly advanced Terminator has been sent to terminate its target, a Mexican woman, Daniella (Natalia Reyes). The only thing standing in its way is Grace (Mackenzie Davis) \u2013 a powerful cyborg-human hybrid \u2013 Sarah Connor (Hamilton), and the original Terminator (Schwarzenegger), who returns as an ally. With a different apocalyptic future looming, it is up to these four individuals to prevent humanity's extinction.\n\nMORE FILM REVIEWS:\n\n'Hello World' is a mind-boggling, sci-fi romance anime\n\nAngelina Jolie carries a predictable but enjoyable 'Maleficent: Mistress of Evil'\n\nWill Smith\u2019s 'Gemini Man' feels like a video game come to life\n\nPHOTO: 20th Century Fox More\n\nAdmittedly, the Rev-9 (Gabriel Luna), the antagonist of the film, doesn't seem that fearsome on first sight. But it's only as the film progresses that the sheer inevitability of its hunt slowly dawns on us, translating into tension and horror as we realise just how unstoppable this menace is. But it's not as if the Rev-9 feels completely invincible, and that's where the film finely balances the power and vulnerability of its main villain. It makes it powerful and persistent enough that we know it's a threat, while still ensuring that it yields to gunfire and other attacks so that its (eventual) defeat is believable.\n\nBut despite the fights and violence, it's not all grit and dirt, as many modern science fiction films are wont to do. The film knows exactly what it's doing \u2014 delivering pain and blood and fear only when it needs to, not just for the sake of it. It knows when to play up the bleak outlook of the characters with such techniques, but it holds back on the more emotional scenes to prevent overuse of its grittiness, allowing some wit and self-awareness to take its place.\n\nPHOTO: 20th Century Fox More\n\nTerminator: Dark Fate is incredibly self-aware (fitting, given its themes), especially since Sarah Connor has lived through a similar adventure once before. But it's not the smarmy kind of self-awareness that comes with a side of self-referential humour \u2014 rather, it\u2019s a self-awareness that comes from knowing how its premise has evolved over the years, and how certain tropes are just taken for granted (like the odd compatibility and knowledge of present and future tech). It's a self-awareness that comes from the sheer confidence that the film possesses.\n\nStory continues", "description": "\"Terminator: Dark Fate\" works because it knows exactly what it's doing.", "authors": ["Marcus Goh"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yg9hThOm7kkgZ2eU_6IhJA--~B/aD01NjM7dz0xMDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/d8783550-f61a-11e9-aefe-8344bfa6fed5", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
