We are an independent country.\u201d\n\nProject Veritas\u2019s Wednesday release comes after the group published a video of a CNN media coordinator saying Zucker has a \u201cpersonal vendetta\u201d against President Donald Trump.\n\nThe UPI contributed to this report.", "description": "Project Veritas released undercover audio in which CNN president Jeff Zucker is heard encouraging staff to vigorously report on impeachment.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/06/GettyImages-521585344.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
