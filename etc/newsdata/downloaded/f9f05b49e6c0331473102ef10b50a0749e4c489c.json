While Republicans are establishing a massive national infrastructure devoted to reelecting President Donald Trump and winning congressional majorities, party officials say the state legislative races are being overlooked.\n\nThe trepidation comes as an array of well-funded Democratic groups \u2014 including one with the backing of former President Barack Obama and ex-Attorney General Eric Holder \u2014 are flooding cash into Virginia, a key redistricting battleground that\u2019s holding state legislative elections this fall\u2026\n\n\u201cThis is as serious as a heart attack and we\u2019ve got to do everything we can to win it because this isn\u2019t about one cycle.
