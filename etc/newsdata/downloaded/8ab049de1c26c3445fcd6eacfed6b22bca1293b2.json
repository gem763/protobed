To celebrate, CBC Books is asking Indigenous artists, community leaders and advocates to share their favourite #IndigenousReads.\n\nActivist, youth educator and cultural performer Theland Kicknosway chose the novel Legacy by Waubgeshig Rice, who hosts CBC Radio's Up North.\n\nKicknosway is the culture, heritage and spirituality recipient of the 2018 Indspire Awards which recognize the contributions Indigenous peoples are making across Canada. The Indspire Awards aired on CBC television, CBC Radio and CBC online on June 24, 2018.\n\n\"This book is based upon a young First Nations woman named Eva Gibson from the Birchbark Indian Reserve. Throughout the book, we get to witness the before and after lives of the Gibson siblings after loss and tragedy. This book touches on how they are rising from substance abuse with help from relatives while rediscovering their healing path and turning to ceremony.\n\n\"I can connect with this book because of what my relatives have shared with me and how I've had to deal with my own loss. One sentence in the book said, 'You had a chance to redefine that legacy.' I believe what they're trying to say to us is that if we get the chance to redefine a legacy, we should seize it. After reading this book, I am grateful that Waubgeshig shares his talents of creating through his storytelling. I look up to him and acknowledge his perseverance and determination for writing such a powerful book.\"\n\nTheland Kicknosway is Potawatami and Cree, a member of the Wolf Clan and of Walpole Island-Bkejwanong Territory in Southern Ontario. He is a singer, a grass and hoop dancer, who helps in various ceremonies. He attends high school in the Ottawa Region, where he is a part of many sports teams and enjoys offering his gifts of song, dance and voice for all. In spring 2018, he completed his fourth annual run in partnership with Families of Sisters in Spirit, a 130-km run to raise awareness for the children of missing and murdered Indigenous Women. At 14, he is the youngest Indspire Award recipient under the Culture, Heritage & Spirituality category in the award's 25-year history.", "description": "Artists, community leaders and advocates are sharing their favourite books by Indigenous writers for Indigenous Book Club Month.", "authors": ["Cbc Books"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4713809.1529499290!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/legacy-theland-kicknosway.jpg"}
