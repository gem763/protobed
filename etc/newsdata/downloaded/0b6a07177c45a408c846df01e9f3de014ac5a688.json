John Fleck made his debut in a deep midfield role with Callum McGregor and John McGinn accompanying him.\n\n\u201cI wanted to have three solid midfield players in the middle, and I thought for 57 minutes that was working fine for us,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we went out of the game because of the personnel or the team shape or the way we set up the tactics.\n\n\u201cWe went out the game because we switched off for a corner, and the fragile confidence after that, we just allowed the game to run away from us.\u201d\n\nScotland had next to no chance of a top-two finish before the defeat confirmed that fact, but they are now four points adrift of third-placed Cyprus in fifth and in serious need of a confidence boost before they take part in the play-offs in March.\n\nThey now host San Marino on Sunday before facing Cyprus and Kazakhstan next month to round off the group.\n\nPA", "description": "Scotland\u00a0head coach Steve Clarke insists he is up for the fight despite finding international management more difficult than he imagined.
