General Assembly.\n\n\u201cWe want to avoid war. But at the same time we have to signal to the Iranians that \u2018your behavior cannot continue\u2019,\u201d he added.\n\nJubeir said the United Nations was helping it identify the launch site for the Sept. 14 attacks, which temporarily knocked out over 5 percent of global oil production and sent petroleum prices spiking higher.\n\nHe said he expected the investigation to be completed \"fairly soon\" but suggested it would be weeks and not days.\n\nYemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attacks on Saudi's Abqaiq and Khurais facilities, but both Riyadh and Washington have laid the blame on Iran.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said there was no evidence the attack came from Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition has been battling the Houthis for over four years in a conflict widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\nTehran has denied involvement.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday called on other nations to join the United States to pressure Iran after the attacks, but said there is a path to peace.
