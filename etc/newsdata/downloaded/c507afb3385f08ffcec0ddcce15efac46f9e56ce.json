Chris Coons (D-DE) warned 2020 presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke about the dangerous road he's going down when he calls for a ban on all semi-automatic AR-15s. Specifically, Coons is afraid O'Rourke's words will be used against the Democratic Party for years to come.\n\n\u201cI frankly think that that clip will be played for years at Second Amendment rallies with organizations that try to scare people by saying that Democrats are coming for your guns,\u201d he told hot Poppy Harlow. \u201cI don\u2019t think having our presidential candidates, like Congressman O\u2019Rourke did, say that we\u2019re going to try to take people\u2019s guns against their will is a wise policy or political move.\"\n\n\"I don't think a majority of the Senate or the country is going to embrace mandatory buybacks. We need to focus on what we can get done,\" Coons said.\n\nCoons has partnered with colleague Pat Toomey (R-PA) to reintroduce the NICS Denial Notification Act. If passed, the bill would require federal authorities to alert local law enforcement agencies about a prohibited possessor attempting to purchase a firearm.\n\nToomey took to Twitter to say he agrees with Coons' assessment of the situation:\n\nI agree with @ChrisCoons. This is an awful and extreme idea. Thankfully, there\u2019s not enough support in Congress to do it. But this rhetoric undermines and hurts bipartisan efforts to actually make progress on commonsense gun safety efforts, like expanding background checks. https://t.co/lRmy8SHc47 \u2014 Senator Pat Toomey (@SenToomey) September 13, 2019\n\nBeto, however, hit back at Coons for his criticism:\n\nMuch respect to Sen. Coons for leading the fight on background checks. But the time for letting status quo politics determine how far we can go is over. If we agree that having millions of weapons of war on the streets is a bad idea, we have to do something about it. https://t.co/xf8tdKrMBJ \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) September 13, 2019\n\nCoons gets it. Gun owners are protective of our Second Amendment rights. We want to make sure our right is sacred. When there are people, like Beto, running for office who explicitly say, \"We're coming for your guns,\" Democrats no longer have anything to grasp. They can no longer use the talking point, \"No one is trying to take your guns away.\"\n\nBeto is confirming what gun owners always knew to be true: our suspicions were right. We can read through the lines and we know what you're going to try to do. They just have an outspoken poster child giving away their so-called \"secrets\" and \"strategy.\"", "description": "Might pay attention, Beto..09/14/2019 20:02:05PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/248/baacaca6-4152-48bb-81e1-75c7736d8b69.png", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
