He would then be expected to turn his efforts to trying to trigger a general election.\n\nLabour is expected to table a customs union amendment later this week when MPs vote on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which would implement Mr Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal in law.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

likely to be backed by almost all opposition party MPs and most of the 21 former Tories expelled by Boris Johnson last month.\n\nAmid speculation that the DUP could also support it, the Daily Telegraph quoted a senior party sources as saying: \u201cClearly that would be one way we could look at addressing our concerns. There will be some very grown-up conversations over the next 48 hours and we will be looking at all the options we have available.\u201d\n\nThe source said the party would launch \u201cparliamentary guerilla warfare\u201d against Mr Johnson in a bid to defeat his deal, which it opposes because the agreement would create a new customs and regulatory border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\n\nThe threat came amid growing confidence among opposition parties that they have the numbers needed to pass a customs union amendment.\n\nNick Thomas Symonds, Labour\u2019s shadow solicitor general, told the BBC\u2019s Westminster Hour: \u201cA customs union is going to be one of the amendments that comes forward and I think that is something that is going to have a very good chance of getting a majority.\u201d\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It is the option that was three votes short of passing in Parliament. I am convinced we can get majority support for it. It would enable us to stay true to the Labour manifesto every Labour MP was elected on.\u201d\n\nLiz Truss, the international trade secretary, claimed that a customs union with the EU would \u201ctake us back to square one and render the UK unable to strike our own bilateral trade agreements around the world\u201d.\n\nWriting in the Telegraph, she said: \u201cThis week, we have another crucial opportunity to end this uncertainty and take the UK out of the EU with deal. And think of where we could be in December 2020 if we do? Free trade deals negotiated with the EU and other partners that ensure our future as a high skilled, innovative, free enterprise economy, excelling in tech, data and services and selling our high-quality food around the world.\n\n\u201cParliament, it\u2019s time to stop the delaying tactics, the games, the excuses. End the waiting. Move forward to the future.
