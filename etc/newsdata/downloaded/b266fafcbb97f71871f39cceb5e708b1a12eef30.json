Brady asks with a smile.\n\n'Uh-huh. You?' Rudd answers.\n\n'Sixth,' Brady says while getting into his car.\n\nTwitter erupted Friday night with people speculating that this was a funny dig at Kraft.\n\nEarlier this year, Kraft (pictured) was busted as one of several clients soliciting services from prostitutes in Jupiter, Florida\n\nIn 2019, it was reveled in a bombshell report that the 77-year-old billionaire was busted for soliciting sex from prostitutes at an Asian massage parlor in Florida.\n\nIt was reported that Kraft visited a prostitute on two separate occasions at Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter.\n\nHe was one of 25 suspected clients whose names were released as part of a six-month human trafficking investigation.\n\nKraft reportedly visited the massage parlor just hours before watching the Patriots beat the Kansas City in the playoffs.\n\nPictured: Brady (left) and Kraft (right) hugging in Gillette Stadium in Massachusetts\n\nBut excited fans have taken the scene out of context, according to Brady.\n\nDuring a locker room interview on Saturday, Brady explained the joke wasn't aimed at Kraft and took a slight jab at reporters in the room.\n\n'That's not what it was about. I think it was taken out of context, just like you're taking it out of context and trying to make it a story for yourself. Which has a negative connotation to it,' he said in a clip from reporter Mark Daniels.\n\n'It was meant to be something different then that.'\n\nHere\u2019s Tom Brady talking about his Netflix cameo pic.twitter.com/OCd8vzMRK3 \u2014 Mark Daniels (@MarkDanielsPJ) October 19, 2019\n\nHe later doubled down and pointed to the 'blame and shame' media atmosphere.\n\n'I think there are a lot of things taken out of context that you chose to make a headline out of, as opposed to understanding what it's actually about.'\n\n'It's unfortunate that people would choose to think I would ever do something like that about Mr. Kraft. I think it's a very bad assessment of my relationship with him.'\n\nIn a locker room interview on Saturday, Brady cleared up the rumors and explained the clip was taken 'out of context'\n\nBrady says the clip has not raised any bad blood between the two, noting that they've known each other for 20 years.\n\nShow creator and writer Timothy Greenberg backs up Brady's point in an interview with Refinery 29.\n\nGreenberg reached out to Brady's team after he wrote him into the script four years ago and couldn't believe when the football legend agreed to do it.\n\nUnfortunately, it was in the middle of football season.\n\nGreenfield said: 'So, we were waiting and waiting and waiting for the Patriots to finish their run and then, sure enough, they won again.'\n\nDuring this time, the Kraft scandal blew wide open and Greenfield was sure Brady would back out of his cameo.\n\nOn top of that, the strip mall where they were shooting had an uncanny similarity to the one Kraft visited.\n\n'Like, I would have used it as a reference photo,' Greenfield said. 'So we\u2019re like, \"Alright, this is clearly not going to happen now\".'\n\nRegardless, Brady still shot the scene and Greenfield was ecstatic.\n\n'When I wrote the script, I was like, \"Here\u2019s a guy that seems ageless and he\u2019s still performing so well because he\u2019s 37 years old and he just won his fourth Super Bowl\".'\n\n\"Four years later, the guy is now 41 and he\u2019s won six Super Bowls. He just won another Super Bowl!\"", "description": "Tom Brady's new cameo in the Netflix show 'Living with Yourself', where he walks out of a massage parlor, has made fans believe he's taking a jab at Patriots owner Robert Kraft", "authors": ["Lauren Edmonds For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/21/19936324-0-image-a-54_1571517031624.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
