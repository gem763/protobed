That\u2019s something that\u2019s impacted manufacturing broadly and textiles specifically.\u201d\n\nWinthrop says he hopes his business model will be a blueprint for other companies since American Giant, which manufactures 100% of its products in the U.S., feels a minimal impact from the trade war.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, U.S. President Donald Trump's national security adviser John Bolton and Chinese President Xi Jinping attend a working dinner after the G20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina December 1, 2018.

The negotiations, which include a delegation on 30 Chinese officials, aim to lay a foundation for further talks next month.\n\nManufacturing output gains in the U.S. for the apparel and leather goods sector are on a steady decline, plummeting 85% between 1987 and 2017, according to the Federal Reserve Board. Winthrop says it\u2019s time to rethink the trend of moving manufacturing overseas.\n\n\u201cMost of the last 40 years were marked by a massive movement overseas by all the brands that I grew up around,\u201d Winthrop explained. \u201cThere are two things that have happened there. One is that the work has left and that\u2019s had real implications for towns, communities and middle class paying jobs\u2026 And the other thing is quality. American Giant is rooted in a quality story and trying to get quality back in the supply chain.\u201d\n\n\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Bayard Winthrop, CEO of clothing company American Giant, joins Alexis Christoforous on 'The Ticker' to discuss how his companying weathering the trade war.", "authors": ["Meghan Fitzgerald"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ujpP79oqINon2epgxWiFHw--~B/aD0yMTk3O3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/5a1ffbc0-db21-11e9-bbd7-952fc37edd0c", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
