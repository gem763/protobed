I believe the whistleblower followed the steps every step of the way.\"\n\nSchiff: \"I'm just asking about the whistleblower right now.\"\n\nMaguire: \"Yes, I think the whistleblower did the right thing. I think he followed the law every step of the way.\"\n\nThe big picture: Maguire further defended the whistleblower's actions, but did not say if he believes the allegations in the complaint are credible.\n\nHe instead said he respected the inspector general of the intelligence community Michael Atkinson's definition of the complaint as credible.\n\nContext: Maguire received the complaint on Aug. 16 from Atkinson but did not forward it to Congress as required by the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act.\n\nMaguire said he did not give Congress the complaint because the protection act stipulates that complaints must concern members of the intelligence community, and the president is not considered a part of the community.\n\nHe said he gave the complaint to the White House and the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) because it concerned the president's phone calls with another foreign leader and could fall under the definition of executive privilege.\n\nMaguire said the OLC ruled that the phone call did fit the definition of executive privilege, so he did not give Congress the complaint because he must comply with its ruling.\n\nGo deeper:", "description": "He testified before the House Intelligence Committee.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/BCo1gg1or7wuiqqVJ7NY1u4R3l8=/47x25:777x436/1920x1080/2019/09/26/1569509002138.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
