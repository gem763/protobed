During some of my most brutal skin phases, Tatcha products have single-handedly saved my complexion from bad breakouts, dullness, and dryness. They also have some of the best dewy-inducing, radiance-boosting, pre-event skincare I\u2019ve ever used. What I love about Tatcha is that while the products are incredibly effective, they\u2019re equally gentle \u2014 you get results without harsh chemicals or skin irritation.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s a downside: Tatcha\u2019s goods are horrifyingly expensive. Their Indigo Cream may have made my dry, eczema-prone skin supple and soft last winter, but paying $85 to re-up became unsustainable. And while the Silk Primer rid me of my fear of primers (they usually make me break out and this one decidedly did not), 0.7 ounces of it will cost you a shocking $52. Are you upset? Ready for some good news? Here it is: Tatcha is having a 20 percent sitewide sale from now through October 20, if you use the code FRIENDS19 at checkout. If you\u2019re overwhelmed or curious where to start, I\u2019m here to help. I created a list of all my favorite products from the Tatcha sale \u2014 some you may recognize from previous articles, some are new friends.\n\nTATCHA The Dewy Skin Cream $55 (was $68, now 19% off) This Dewy Skin Cream from Tatcha has quickly become on my all time favorite pre-makeup skin prep heroes. After applying this cream, you\u2019ll instantly notice that your skin looks plumper, brighter, and intensely nourished. I have super temperamental, eczema prone skin that loves to curse me with flakey dry patches as soon as the temperature drops below 70 degrees. This cream heals any of that and gives me the glowy skin base of my dreams. Plus, makeup glides over it like a dream. This is a must-have for any dewy skin enthusiasts or makeup lovers. $55 at Tatcha Buy with code: FRIENDS19\n\nTatcha Violet-C Vitamin C Radiance Mask $55 (was $68, now 19% off) One of my all-time favorite, pre-event staples is this Violet-C Vitamin C Radiance Mask. Just to get this out of the way: This mask is the most beautiful violet color, so taking photos in it is super fun. But apart from the aesthetic delights of this product, it has awesome skin-brightening and skin-nourishing ingredients. This mask is packed with green tea, algae, and rice for anti-aging, skin-softening, and hydrating benefits, as well as two types of vitamin C (oil-soluble and water-soluble), so make sure your skin is getting that antioxidant protection and serious radiance boost. $55 at Tatcha Buy with code: FRIENDS19\n\nTatcha The Essence Plumping Skin Softener $76 (was $95, now 20% off) As someone with super dry, irritated skin, I love an essence. If you haven\u2019t yet incorporated an essence into your routine, it\u2019s a great supplementary step to ensure your skin is getting as much moisture and nourishment as it needs after exfoliating. This essence from Tatcha I tried a little while ago and fell in love with. Much like the dewy skin cream, the ingredient list includes what Tatcha deems their \u201choly trinity\u201d: green tea extract, algae, and rice which, when fermented, all have this amazing plumping, softening, and hydrating effects. This is great for anyone who struggles with dryness as it doubles the skin\u2019s moisture in take. $76 at Tatcha Buy with code: FRIENDS19\n\nTatcha Indigo Recovery Cream $68 (was $85, now 20% off) This is one of the best nighttime moisturizers I have ever used. It\u2019s very rich, but it absorbs into the skin very quickly so it doesn\u2019t leave you feeling greasy or sticky. The product\u2019s blend of oatmeal and Japanese indigo is calming and reparative, and has helped me calm redness from breakouts and eczema. For anyone with dry, acne prone skin, this is a must-try. $68 at Tatcha Buy with code: FRIENDS19\n\nTatcha Luminous Dewy Skin Mist $38 (was $48, now 21% off) When it comes to face mists, this one is the one to try. On rushed, no makeup mornings, I sometimes use this as the only step in my routine: A few spritzes on clean skin provides nourishment and moisture, and makes my face look super-bright and dewy. On full-on glam makeup days, I use this as my final, makeup-setting step. It makes everything melt into my skin and gives a perfect, flawless finish. $38 at Tatcha Buy with code: FRIENDS19\n\nTatcha Silk Canvas Primer $42 (was $52, now 19% off) I wrote a full-length review of this product, so if you want the nitty-gritty, read it. But very long story short, this is one of the only primers I\u2019m willing to use. Not only does this never, ever make me breakout, it also keeps my makeup looking frighteningly fresh and flawless \u2014 like I\u2019ve just applied it \u2014 all day long. $42 at Tatcha Buy with code: FRIENDS19\n\nTatcha Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen $52 (was $65, now 20% off) If you\u2019re looking for a great, everyday sunscreen this one is definitely worth buying. It absorbs super quickly into the skin and doesn\u2019t leave a white cast. Plus, after you apply, makeup glides on super easily on top of it. It also has a slight matte-ifying effect on the skin, so it won\u2019t leave you looking greasy \u2014 which I think we all can agree is unique for an SPF. $52 at Tatcha Buy with code: FRIENDS19\n\nTatcha Camellia Goldspun Lip Balm $24 (was $30, now 20% off) This lip balm is not only the perfect gift (it has pretty gold flakes in it), it\u2019s also really effective. Apparently Japanese female free-divers have used camellia oil (the main product in this balm) for thousands of years to protect their skin and hair from the salty ocean water. I can see why: this super-thick and creamy lip balm does a truly incredible job at soothing and healing chapped lips. It is probably my second favorite chapstick of all time, right after my beloved Bite Agave Lip Mask. $24 at Tatcha Buy with code: FRIENDS19\n\nTatcha Rice Polish: Gentle $52 (was $65, now 20% off) This is a physical \u2014 not a chemical \u2014 exfoliant. Though it is technically a scrub, it is incredibly gentle \u2014 it contains rice bran and papa enzymes and transforms into a foam when you add water to it. Tatcha\u2019s motto is, essentially, \u201cdoing small things for your skin every day will give you the best results\u201d (instead of using super-intense chemical exfoliants, in other words). This product the definition of that ethos: It\u2019ll never make your skin red and dry, and will make your skin noticeably smoother within just one use. $52 at Tatcha Buy with code: FRIENDS19\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
