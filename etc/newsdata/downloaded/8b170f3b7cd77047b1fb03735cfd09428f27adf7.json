Austin Ekeler's huge day lifts Chargers, doesn't bode well for Gordon", "language": "en", "text": "What remained of Melvin Gordon\u2019s leverage with the Los Angeles Chargers took a big blow on Sunday.\n\nAustin Ekeler had a huge day that included the game-winning touchdown against the Indianapolis Colts and reinforced the team\u2019s stance that its backfield can thrive with or without its Pro Bowl running back.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nEkeler tallied 58 rushing yards, 96 receiving yards and three total touchdowns in an effort that should have Chargers management and his fantasy owners beaming.\n\nWhere do things stand with Melvin Gordon?\n\nGordon, meanwhile, is still holding out after the Chargers announced they were done negotiating last week.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\n\u201cWe have to get focused on the season and our next opponent,\u201d general manager Tom Telesco told reporters. \u201cSo when or if Melvin reports, he'll play this season on his current contract, and we'll just revisit it after the season.\u201d\n\nAustin Ekeler looked more than ready to fill Melvin Gordon's shoes on Sunday. (Reuters)\n\nThat focus Telesco spoke of included a heavy does of Ekeler with an effective sprinkling of Justin Jackson, the second-year running back who tallied 57 rushing yards on just six carries Sunday.\n\nWill Gordon\u2019s holdout follow Le\u2019Veon Bell\u2019s path?\n\nFor one week, at least, it proved a successful formula and points to a situation that looks more like Le\u2019Veon Bell\u2019s with the Pittsburgh Steelers last season than Ezekiel Elliott\u2019s holdout that ended with a rich new deal with the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nThe Steelers discovered a new Pro Bowl running back in James Conner last season and stood fast in refusing to give Bell a rich new contract.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s only one game, but Ekeler flashed Pro Bowl potential in Sunday\u2019s win playing in loaded Chargers offense. Regardless, the Chargers remain clearly intent on declining to entertain a contract extension with Gordon, a 25-year-old four-year veteran on his rookie deal looking to cash in while he\u2019s in his prime.\n\nHoldout could last until November\n\nESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter reported early Sunday that Gordon\u2019s holdout could continue into November, where Gordon may be compelled to report to avoid missing a deadline that would cost him his shot at unrestricted free agency in 2020.\n\nThis appears the most likely scenario outside of a trade if Gordon is intent on protecting his body without a big payday, much like Bell was last year.\n\nIf Sunday is any indication, the Chargers will be satisfied with their backup plan in the meantime.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "What remained of Melvin Gordon\u2019s leverage with the Los Angeles Chargers took a big blow on Sunday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/mWTMIVt2qi48quE7ng1HoA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.L1zWpJbRC0WxfBkJILYZA--~B/aD0yNDAwO3c9MzYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/f52f37e0-d2a5-11e9-a370-6b8788c011c3", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
