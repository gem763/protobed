He was given \"dangerous offender\" status in 2015 and is currently serving an indefinite sentence.\n\nIn 2018, Toutsaint filed a human rights complaint against Corrections Canada for denial of mental health treatment. Corrections Canada said it cannot comment on Toutsaint's case and pointed to the new law for inmates who cannot be held in general population.\n\nWarning: This video contains some graphic and disturbing content:\n\nDid Ashley Smith\u2019s death end solitary confinement? The tragic death of inmate Ashley Smith in 2007 was supposed to change everything for mentally ill patients in prison. Canadians were horrified to see the video of her suicide with prison guards looking on that The Fifth Estate fought to make public. The inquest into her death called for 104 recommendations including eliminating solitary confinement. We investigate the case of Joey Toutsaint, an inmate with serious mental illness who, by his own count, has spent nearly six years (2580 days) in isolation in prison. 16:54\n\nPrisoner isolation, declared unconstitutional nearly two years ago, remains legal after Canada's top court granted Ottawa's request in June to allow the current law to stay in force for the time being \u2014 a law that Smith's mother and sister say is highly flawed.\n\nSmith died in 2007 by self-strangulation at Grand Valley Institution in Kitchener, Ont., while guards videotaped her death and did not intervene. She was 19 and had spent more than 1,000 days in segregation and was moved from institution to institution.\n\nThe inquest into Smith's death produced 104 recommendations, including a call to end \"indefinite solitary confinement.\"\n\nA number of human-rights organizations say the law \u2014 known as Bill C-83 before it was given royal assent in June\u2014 offers only a cosmetic rebranding of solitary confinement with no hard time limits on isolation or separation of inmates. The current law has such restrictions on the use of segregation when it's used a disciplinary measure.\n\nIn June, a spokesperson for Ralph Goodale, the former public safety minister, disputed suggestions that the then-bill preserves solitary confinement under a different name.\n\n\"C-83 allows for the separation of inmates when that's necessary for safety reasons, while providing programs, interventions, mental health care and meaningful human contact on a daily basis \u2014 all subject to binding external review,\" Scott Bardsley said.", "description": "Ashley Smith's death in prison 12 years ago was supposed to lead to reforms for mentally ill inmates and changes to solitary confinement, but\u00a0The Fifth Estate\u00a0discovered another troubling case unfolding in a Canadian prison.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5336345.1572038545!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/homepagefifthestateashleysmith.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
