She claimed it would often blame the national government for its woes.\n\nDiep River not contaminated - City\n\nLimberg said mobile diesel pumps were currently being used while the damaged pump was being repaired.\n\nThe spill has apparently not flowed into the Diep River or Rietvlei, which is next to the R27 on the way to suburbs such as Dolphin Beach and Bloubergstrand.\n\nThe City planned to submit samples from Rietvlei and Diep River as part of a due diligence process.\n\nSewage spill at the Rietvlei section of Table Bay Nature Reserve (Supplied)\n\nIt would also run educational campaigns around preventing sewer blockages throughout the metro and has applied for funding to prevent contaminated run-off from entering the river system.\n\nLimberg added \"recently invaded land\" was unserviced at first and this had resulted in the pollution of nearby water bodies until municipal services such as sewers and toilets were provided.\n\n\"As mentioned above, the vast majority of sewer overflows are caused by the misuse of the system, rather than capacity constraints,\" she said.\n\nDr Jo Barnes, who works at Stellenbosch University's water-borne diseases unit at Tygerberg Hospital, remarked, \"that's extremely convenient\".\n\nGovernment spheres passing the buck\n\nBarnes added it was not people blocking sewers, or land invasions that were the problem.\n\nPoor maintenance and upkeep was a widespread problem in South Africa, she said, and the departments of water and sanitation, environmental affairs, and cooperative governance passed the buck whenever there was a spill.\n\nRietvlei section of Table Bay Nature Reserve (Supplied)\n\nBarnes added sewage spills were happening in established \"formal\" suburbs and new informal settlements, saying proper municipal oversight was needed to hold the responsible bodies to account.\n\n\"In part we have the municipalities doing the least they can get away with, and also, because they are cash-strapped. I am really, really, really worried because we are not even creating channels but highways for the outbreak of diseases.\"", "description": "A faulty sewage pump is causing a stink among residents of Table View in Cape Town who are concerned about the environment and potential for diseases.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9457/6b230b173f2846719a4ff4b71a74b097.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
