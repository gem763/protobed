REUTERS/Phil Noble\n\nDIGITAL WORLD\n\nThe 40-year-old firm based in Sunderland in north-east England reached sales of more than 1 billion pounds ($1.2 billion) in 2018.\n\nIts management said it was optimistic the shops would prosper thanks to the firm\u2019s distinctive approach, where employees have free rein to give each branch a distinctive character, often built through social media.\n\n\u201cThe death of the high street travel is a question we\u2019ve been asked for many years, but we feel we do something different to other high street travel agents,\u201d John Hays told reporters.\n\n\u201cWe live in a digital world ... The Web was their enemy (at Thomas Cook), whereas if you ask the Hays Travel member of staff, they would say the Web is their friend, because we interact positively with it.\u201d\n\nHays Travel currently operates just 190 of its own branches across the United Kingdom, employing 1,900 people.\n\nThe company said it had no plans to close any shops, but would evaluate the performance of each store going forward.\n\nHays Travel did not disclose financial details of the deal, other than saying it had been funded without taking on any debt.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nRyanair boss Michael O\u2019Leary (RYA.I) last week said the business models of both tour operators and travel agents were dead as no young people bought holidays from them.\n\nIrene Hays said her company\u2019s data showed differently.\n\n\u201cThere has been a huge resurgence in package holidays in recent years,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s evident, it\u2019s in all of our metrics. So the answer is no, we do not agree with Michael O\u2019Leary.\u201d", "description": "Hays Travel will buy all of Thomas Cook's British travel agent shops, potentially saving up to 2,500 jobs and providing a rare boost for high streets across the country.", "authors": ["Alistair Smout", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438795267&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF980VG", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
