The Saints\u2019 Drew Brees is out several weeks with a thumb injury. The Panthers\u2019 Cam Newton has a foot injury, the Jets\u2019 Sam Darnold has been out with mono and Jacksonville\u2019s Nick Foles will miss several weeks with a broken collarbone.\n\nAnd two more got hurt Sunday.\n\nThe Bears\u2019 Mitchell Trubisky left the game against Minnesota because of a left shoulder injury. A scrambling Trubisky was hurt on the opening possession. Danielle Hunter dragged him down and the quarterback\u2019s arm got pinned awkwardly under his body as the ball popped out. Minnesota recovered the fumble, but a holding penalty against Anthony Harris negated the play.\n\nBills quarterback Josh Allen was placed in the NFL\u2019s concussion protocol after taking a helmet-to-helmet hit by Patriots defensive back Jonathan Jones in the opening minute of the fourth quarter of a 16-10 loss to New England.\n\nThe hit occurred when Allen scrambled out of the pocket and burst through a hole up the middle while facing third-and-8 at the New England 45. He gained 7 yards before Jones closed in on him, lowered his helmet and struck the quarterback in the crown of his helmet. Jones was flagged for a personal foul for unnecessary roughness.\n\nAllen lay on the field for several minutes before hopping up on his own. He was briefly evaluated on the sideline before being escorted up the tunnel. Allen was spotted in the locker room chatting with teammates following the game.\n\nIn other injury news:\n\nChargers defensive end Melvin Ingram left in the first quarter at Miami with a hamstring injury.\n\nLions tight end T.J.
