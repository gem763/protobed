(Anything below 50 on the index signifies contraction.) The good news was that forecasters expected an uptick this month, with economists surveyed by MarketWatch predicting a total of 50.2 percent. That would indicate only very modest expansion, but any expansion is good.\n\nThe actual number released today: 47.8 percent. The contraction is deepening. If it were to deepen further, the entire economy could be dragged into contraction as well.\n\nThere are two competing narratives for why this happened. There\u2019s Trump\u2019s, which is to blame anyone and anything except the trade war he initiated. That means blaming the Fed.\n\nAs I predicted, Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve have allowed the Dollar to get so strong, especially relative to ALL other currencies, that our manufacturers are being negatively affected. Fed Rate too high. They are their own worst enemies, they don\u2019t have a clue. Pathetic! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2019\n\nThe wrinkle in that theory is that the Fed did lower interest rates two weeks ago, the second time since late July that it\u2019s ordered a rate cut. Powell is doing what he can to counteract the economic slowdown caused by the exchange of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs between Trump and China. Trump\u2019s attitude is that no matter how much the Fed cuts, it\u2019s not cutting enough. If your business is suffering, take it up with Powell.\n\nThe other narrative, repeated ad nauseam by analysts in the reporting today on the manufacturing downturn, is that it\u2019s the trade war that\u2019s driving this. Of course it\u2019s the trade war:\n\nMany of the comments from survey participants point to Trump\u2019s trade war with China, noting that the retaliatory tariffs are hurting business and undermining confidence, despite comments from administration officials claiming Americans have not been impacted by the dispute\u2026 Total new orders for manufactured goods were at their lowest since 2012. Export orders, which feed into overall orders, fell to 41 percent, their worst month since March of 2009\u2026 Of 18 industries surveyed, three experienced growth \u2014 miscellaneous goods, food and chemical products \u2014 and even they reported growth was weak to flat.\n\nAlthough this is only the second straight month in which the index has been below 50 percent, it\u2019s the sixth straight month that it\u2019s declined. \u201c[T]he warning signs here are clear enough. The trade war is wreaking havoc, to the point where the incipient upturn in manufacturing in China is not transmitting, at all, to the US,\u201d said one analyst to IBT. \u201cWe have now tariffed our way into a manufacturing recession in the U.S. and globally,\u201d another investment advisor told CNBC. More from MarketWatch:\n\n\u201cChinese tariffs going up are hurting our business. Most of the materials are not made in the U.S. and made only in China,\u201d said an executive at a food and beverages manufacturer. \u201cEconomy seems to be softening. The tariffs have caused much confusion in the industry,\u201d said an executive at a company that makes electrical equipment\u2026 \u201cManufacturing weakness is close to dangerous levels. Historically, readings under 46 are consistent with recession,\u201d said senior economist Chris Low of FTN Financial. \u201cManufacturing is a small part of the economy, but it is a vitally important one, producing income and multiplier effects, especially in the Midwest.\u201d\n\nThe chief economist for the Japanese bank MUFG put it this way: \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be more ironic that the trade tariffs done to bring factories back from overseas, are actually shutting down production at existing plants here in the U.S.\u201d The news about American manufacturing shrinking comes a day after the WTO announced that it\u2019s cutting its forecast for global trade growth from 2.6 percent to 1.2 percent, the weakest projection since the Great Recession. They could cut it further pending further trade war escalation and the outcome of the Brexit mess in the UK.\n\nAll of this helps explain Trump\u2019s curious congratulatory tweet to China this morning on the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the PRC. Righties have been lashing him for that on Twitter today because the ChiComs are, after all, one of the world\u2019s most loathsome regimes. But Trump has never had moral qualms about doing business with monsters, as his North Korea policy proves most vividly. He\u2019s transactional, and he\u2019s trying to get Kim Jong Un to agree to a particular transaction. The state of U.S. manufacturing makes it that much more urgent that he convince China to agree to a particular transaction too \u2014 the end of the trade war sometime over the next 13 months, preferably sooner rather than later so that the economy has time to regain steam before November. Some economists are already predicting that he\u2019ll make a deal even if the differences between the old and new U.S./China trade relationship end up being cosmetic, simply in order to get past this in time for reelection.\n\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s been uncharacteristically friendly-sounding to China throughout the process, up to and including something as small as this morning\u2019s tweet. He just can\u2019t afford to lash them like he does with most other rivals and enemies. They have too much leverage over his electoral fortunes by dint of the trade war, and the worse the economic forecasts look, the more leverage they have.", "description": "\u201cWe have now tariffed our way into a manufacturing recession in the U.S. and globally.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/t-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
