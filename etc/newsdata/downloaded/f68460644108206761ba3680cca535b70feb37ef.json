It captured an illuminated image of the moon and also measured the variation in the sunlight reflected by the moon\u2019s surface.\n\nThe image will help us understand the composition of the moon\u2019s surface (its origin and evolution) better. As we know that the moon doesn\u2019t have light of its own and what it does is reflect the sunlight that hits the lunar surface. There are variations in the sunlight that the moon reflects and these variations happens due to the composition of minerals on the lunar surface.\n\nHere is the picture:\n\n#ISRO\n\nSee the first illuminated image of the lunar surface acquired by #Chandrayaan2\u2019s IIRS payload. IIRS is designed to measure reflected sunlight from the lunar surface in narrow and contiguous spectral channels.\n\nFor details visit:https://t.co/C3STg4H79S pic.twitter.com/95N2MpebY4 \u2014 ISRO (@isro) October 17, 2019\n\nA particular area of the moon that is rich in a certain mineral will always reflect the sunlight differently than another area that is rich in some other mineral. And that is why clicking the variations can give us an insight into the composition of the moon\u2019s surface.\n\nDon't Miss 5.3 K SHARES 593 SHARES 1.9 K SHARES 240 SHARES\n\nIdentifying the elements, seeing the lunar surface will definitely help us in understanding the moon better.\n\nNASA also tried to establish the contact with Vikram Lander and sent 'hello' messages to the Indian lander in hopes to connect with it. NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory beamed a radio frequency to Vikram to establish contact with it.", "description": "Even though we could not establish any contacts with the Vikram Lander that lost communication with ground stations during its final 2.1-km descent.
