Such moves would typically be considered only when the economy faces a substantial downturn.\n\nWednesday\u2019s comments are the first time Mr. Trump has called for rates below zero. In response to a reporter\u2019s question several weeks ago, Mr. Trump said he didn\u2019t want negative rates.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nYields in some countries including Germany, France and the Netherlands have fallen below zero already. On Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive James Dimon said the bank has begun discussing what fees and charges it could introduce if interest rates go to zero or lower. Even during the last recession, the Fed didn\u2019t employ negative rates.\n\nPresident Trump and White House officials have said they don\u2019t believe the U.S. is headed toward a slowdown, but also have floated other ideas, such as tax cuts, to boost the economy.\n\nA rate cut of the magnitude Mr. Trump is calling for hasn\u2019t happened since the global financial crisis in late 2008.\n\nIn comments last week, Mr. Powell said the U.S. economy faced a favorable outlook despite significant risks from weaker global growth and trade uncertainty.\n\n\u2014Paul Kiernan contributed to this article.\n\nSpeaking on a panel in Switzerland, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the Fed isn\u2019t expecting a recession and that the U.S. economy is in a good place.
