The fact is that the financial system .... is the most heavily regulated part of the economy. That's for a reason, there are lots of ways it can go wrong,\" Carney said.\n\nThe central banker cited the example of the \"huge advances\" of financial technology (fintech) in China which has helped to create \"one of the larger shadow banking bubbles in the world today.\"\n\n\"Quite often a good idea leads to other issues which is why central banks and regulators have to be on top of them. And its why we have to look at them as a whole,\" said Carney.\n\nThe U.K. central bank chief was speaking on an IMF panel moderated by CNBC's Elizabeth Schulze in Washington on Wednesday.\n\nCarney said one main role of central banks in the development of fintech would be to remove impediments to different parties, ensuring a \"level playing field\" so good ideas aren't excluded.\n\nCarney has appeared more open to Facebook's libra cryptocurrency than other officials. He said on Tuesday that the digital token could help offer an alternative U.K.'s payments system, which he described as \"slow and expensive.\" As far back as June, Carney had said he was keeping an \"open mind but not an open door\" on libra.\n\nThe central banker has also proposed a virtual currency alternative to the dollar as the world's reserve currency. Carney argued such a digital currency \"could dampen the domineering influence of the U.S. dollar on global trade.\"", "description": "Carney says the financial system is the most heavily regulated part of the economy and central banks must use its role to act as a guardian to risk.", "authors": ["David Reid Ryan Browne", "David Reid", "Ryan Browne"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106054086-1564661476700gettyimages-1158928105.jpeg?v=1564661529", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
