She performed in works by renowned choreographers including George Balanchine, Antony Tudor, Michel Fokine and Agnes de Mille, and her longtime onstage partnership with the late Igor Youskevitch was such a successful match that the pair earned favorable comparisons to ballet legends Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs a performer, Ms. Alonso\u2019s singular achievement was her rendition of the title role in \u201cGiselle.\u201d More than 60 years after she first performed it, Ms. Alonso\u2019s interpretation is still widely considered the definitive version of one of ballet\u2019s most difficult and demanding parts.\n\nCritics were impressed by Ms. Alonso\u2019s versatility and power. \u201cEqually admired for her classical and modern interpretations, in her prime she also commanded extreme extensions, stunningly fast turns and powerful jumps of the kind that made audiences gasp,\u201d Washington Post dance critic Alan M. Kriegsman once wrote.\n\nIn launching the National Ballet in 1959, Ms. Alonso gave Cuba a first-rate classical dance troupe and school that could rival the world\u2019s best \u2014 no minor feat in a small country without any noteworthy ballet tradition. She imbued the company with the sensuality and musicality that defined her own dancing and that she has said is ingrained in Cuban culture.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCuban leader Fidel Castro sought to revitalize the arts in post-revolution Cuba, and his backing was critical to the National Ballet\u2019s success. \u201cHe knew I was a cultural ambassador for our little land. He saw I had vision. Well, he did, too,\u201d Ms. Alonso told an interviewer in 2007.\n\nGiven her formidable contributions to the arts and her strong ties to Castro, arts critic Octavio Roca wrote in the Miami Herald in 2004 that Ms. Alonso \u201cis unique in the world of culture: one of the greatest of all time and a political figure who polarizes argument in every corner of the Cuban diaspora.\u201d\n\nThough she typically shunned discussing politics in interviews, she occasionally spoke of her support of Cuba\u2019s communist regime, earning her adoration from loyalists and ire from defectors and others who opposed Castro\u2019s government.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 1957 and 1958, Ms. Alonso was asked to give guest performances with the Bolshoi Ballet and Kirov Ballet, a rare invitation for a ballerina from the Americas in an era when Russian and European performers reigned supreme in the ballet world. She also performed with the Ballet Russes de Monte Carlo and served as a guest choreographer for the Paris Opera Ballet.\n\nAlicia Ernestina de la Caridad delCobre Martinez y del Hoyo was born in Havana on Dec. 21, 1920, to an army officer and his wife.\n\nBefore beginning ballet lessons at 9, \u201cMama used to put me in a room with a phonograph and a scarf,\u201d she told Dance magazine in 1953. \u201cThat would keep me quiet for a few hours, doing what I imagined was dancing.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhen she was 15, she eloped with Fernando Alonso, a fellow ballet student. The pair left Cuba for New York, convinced they\u2019d have a better chance of becoming ballet stars. Within a year, Ms. Alonso gave birth to their only child, Laura. She later divorced Fernando Alonso and married Pedro Simon, a lawyer and dance writer. Her husband and daughter survive.\n\nAD\n\nBefore she was able to land jobs in ballet, Ms. Alonso and her first husband appeared in two short-lived Broadway musicals, \u201cGreat Lady\u201d (1938) and \u201cStars in Your Eyes\u201d (1939).\n\nNot long after, Ms. Alonso received a contract with Ballet Caravan, a group headed by impresario Lincoln Kirstein that was a precursor to the New York City Ballet. In 1940, she became a member of the nascent Ballet Theatre, which is today known as American Ballet Theatre.\n\nAD\n\nThe following year, just as her star was beginning to rise, she noticed that her vision was beginning to fail. She underwent three surgeries to try to correct a detached retina, the last of which required her to stay in bed for a year, lying practically motionless with her eyes covered by bandages.\n\nStill, her passion for dance wouldn\u2019t allow her to remain completely sedentary. Employing small movements of her hands and feet, she taught herself the lead role in \u201cGiselle\u201d during this time.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was torture for me to be still, feeling myself gain weight and become flabby,\u201d she told Dance magazine in 1953. \u201cI realized then that dancing was the most important part of my life.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn a testament to her grit and determination, Ms. Alonso was back onstage by 1943. The surgeries did not completely correct her sight; she still lacked peripheral vision from that point forward. To help her, a wire was often placed at the front of the stage to prevent her from falling into the orchestra pit, and lights were strategically placed around the stage so she could determine where she was by their relative brightness.\n\nYouskevitch, her partner, became an expert at dancing with her, making sure he was always in the exact correct position relative to Ms. Alonso so she would not have to rely on sight to dance with him.\n\nAD\n\nMs. Alonso gave her first performance of \u201cGiselle\u201d in 1943 as a last-minute replacement for an ill Alicia Markova. The part would come to define her career, and she would perform it for ABT, Ballet Russes de Monte Carlo and National Ballet of Cuba for decades to come.\n\nAD\n\nMs. Alonso\u2019s other notable roles include a turn as Lizzie Borden in de Mille\u2019s \u201cFall River Legend\u201d (1948) and in Fokine\u2019s \u201cLes Sylphides.\u201d She originated lead roles in Balanchine\u2019s \u201cTheme and Variations\u201d (1947) and \u201cUndertow\u201d (1945), Tudor\u2019s psychological drama about a tormented man who commits a murder.\n\nWhile working with Tudor, fellow ABT dancer Donald Saddler remembered Ms. Alonso\u2019s flinty attitude when the choreographer, notorious for berating his dancers, approached her. \u201cShe put her hands on her hips and she said, \u2018Mr. Tudor, you can\u2019t ever make me cry.\u2019 He never picked on her again,\u201d Saddler told the Los Angeles Times in 1998.\n\nAD\n\nIn 1948, Ms. Alonso headed back to Cuba to establish her own company. However, Alicia Alonso Ballet Co. struggled from the start, largely because of a lack of funding, and it folded in 1956. Three years later, when Castro came into power, Ms. Alonso asked the new leader for funds to set up a ballet school and company.\n\nAD\n\nFernando Alonso, who served as an administrator for the company, settled on the details with Castro during a late-night meeting at the Alonso home.\n\nIn 1978, he told The Post that Castro said, \u201c \u2018It\u2019s so late, I forgot I have an appointment and must go.\u2019 He started down the stairs and stopped to shout up, \u2018I forgot what I came for! I forgot to ask you how much money you need for the ballet.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI shouted back, without thinking, \u2018About $100,000!\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you $200,000, but it better be a good ballet!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWith that, Ms. Alonso founded the National Ballet of Cuba, which would comprise a school and professional company. To recruit dancers and drum up interest in ballet among Cubans, she had her fledgling group give small performances at unconventional places like farms, factories and on military bases. She looked for male dancers in orphanages and gave free tuition to those with potential.\n\nThe company landed touring gigs in South and Central America and throughout Europe. Over the years, several of the company\u2019s dancers have defected during international tours, but a few of its brightest stars have been granted permission to leave Cuba to perform with other troupes, most notably Jose Manuel Carre\u00f1o of American Ballet Theatre, Lorena Feijoo of San Francisco Ballet and Carlos Acosta, who has performed with the Royal Ballet.\n\nThroughout her tenure with the National Ballet of Cuba, Ms. Alonso guest performed internationally with other troupes but was rarely seen in the United States during some of the prime years of her career because the Eisenhower administration cut off diplomatic ties to Cuba. However, she was to appear in the country again, performing in New York with ABT in 1975 and 1977. She brought her full company for its U.S. debut in 1978.\n\nLong after her final curtain call, dance remained Ms. Alonso\u2019s passion. \u201cI\u2019m breathing life into other people,\u201d she told an interviewer in 2007. \u201cI make choreography for others to dance. It\u2019s like dancing through their spirit. You see I\u2019m still dancing, even if my feet never move.\u201d", "description": "The ballet company became one of the country\u2019s premiere cultural institutions, and she maintained a steel-like grip on power over the troupe well into her 90s.", "authors": ["Sarah Halzack"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/NVsF-6TIAvdWncpW_8nhUcT89j8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HJKOGWHRAMI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
