For every problem facing our nation, her slogan says she \u201chas a plan for that.\u201d Warren is running on a myriad of big government programs including Medicare for all, student loan debt cancellation, and free college tuition. Her plan to pay for these promises includes a wealth tax of 2 percent on fortunes above $50 million and 3 percent on fortunes above $1 billion.\n\nTo many voters, her plans sound attractive, and her years in academia lend to her pitch. She is articulate and crafty enough to crib off Sanders, while arguing that she just wants capitalism with a human face. In reality, however, the former Harvard professor is hoping you will not do the math yourself when it comes to her grandiose pitch. Almost every element of her plans would drive discourse to the left, while weakening our political and economic systems to make it susceptible to crony capitalism.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEven the centerpiece of the Warren campaign platform is obviously unworkable. A wealth tax on fortunes above $50 million is touted as the key funding mechanism for a plethora of new programs. But European nations have attempted numerous such wealth taxes, and none have been successful. Since 1990, the number of European states with such a levy has fallen from a dozen to three, including otherwise low tax Switzerland. Between 2000 and 2012, the burdensome wealth tax in France caused 42,000 millionaires to flee the country. The nation ultimately scrapped the impost in 2018.\n\nWhile a wealth tax in the United States is likely unconstitutional to begin with, it is certainly unenforceable in the way that Warren desires. Look no further than what happened in 1990, when President Bush caved to Democrats in Congress to raise taxes on luxury goods. Commonly referred to as the yacht tax, it implemented excise taxes on items associated with the wealthy such as cars, jewelry, and private jets.\n\nWhen the levy was passed, Congress predicted it would bring in $31 million during the first year, but the actual haul was half of that. As a result, consumption of such high end goods fell and prices soared. The most tangible results of the tax were most devastating for middle class workers, as nearly 10,000 jobs were destroyed in the luxury goods industry\u2014and the $17.6 million in new tax revenue was offset by over $24 million in lost income tax and unemployment benefits for the newly out-of-work industrial employees. The taxes were slowly (and quietly) repealed during the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest problem with Warren\u2019s wealth tax plan is that it would bring in an average of just $2.75 trillion over the following decade\u2014which would provide less than 10 percent of the total cost of just one of Warren\u2019s major policy planks, Medicare for All. Warren won\u2019t state the obvious: to pay for any of her policy proposals, they would require a massive middle class tax hike.\n\nEven worse, Warren actually proposes a frightening Office of United States Corporations through her \u201cAccountable Capitalism Act.\u201d According to the Act, workers must represent 40 percent of corporate boards of companies worth more than $1 billion. It also institutes strict controls on political spending and requires a corporate charter approved by the federal government. As CNBC warns, Warren\u2019s proposal is a \u201crecipe for crony capitalism.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA federal corporate charter administered by an appointee of the president is Orwellian. After all, the idea of government control of private industry is among the textbook definitions of fascism and its concept of \u201ccorporatism.\u201d Corporation\u2019s charters\u2014and their legal right to do business\u2014could be revoked by Washington. If you are a Democrat and want President Warren to have this power over private business, then President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump criticizes supposed second whistleblower North Korea missile test raises fears of new capabilities Window narrows for Trump trade deals MORE 2.0 would have that power, as well.\n\nEven though Warren\u2019s policies won\u2019t actually work for you and me, we know it will work for Washington. An exploding federal bureaucracy and tax service to collect revenue will be a fat bottom dollar for DC bureaucrats. And similar to the wealth taxes in European nations before repeal, wealthy Americans will lobby Congress for exemptions to the tax.\n\nReplacing institutions with leviathan government labyrinths will only serve to aid those wealthy enough to either manipulate the system or sidestep it altogether. When Warren tries to give the wealthy 40 whacks and comes up dry, don\u2019t be surprised when you are paying the taxes she promised you Bezos and Gates would.\n\nKristin Tate is a libertarian writer and an analyst for Young Americans for Liberty.
