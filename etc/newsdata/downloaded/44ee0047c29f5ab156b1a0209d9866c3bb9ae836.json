The move was rejected.\n\nThe charity was funded with a $10 million gift in 2015 from financier Leon Black. The gift was made through a limited-liability company controlled by Mr. Black but didn\u2019t bear his name. Gratitude America reported more than $1.8 million in charitable contributions in 2016 and 2017 combined, but some of the recipients listed in the charity\u2019s filings said they never received any money. A spokeswoman for Mr. Black didn\u2019t provide a comment.\n\nGratitude America banked through an account at Deutsche Bank AG , where Mr. Epstein was a customer in Deutsche Bank\u2019s Key Client Partners group, which is reserved for the bank\u2019s wealthiest and often most profitable customers, according to people who were close to the relationship. Members of the elite group have access to services including loans, trading desks and investment opportunities, people close to the bank say.\n\nMr. Epstein died by suicide last month in a Manhattan jail cell while facing federal sex-trafficking charges. Mr. Epstein\u2019s finances, including his relationship with Deutsche Bank, have come under scrutiny amid the federal investigation, which is ongoing.\n\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s connection to Gratitude America and Mr. Epstein\u2019s status at the bank haven\u2019t been previously reported. The bank has said it is closely examining any business relationship with Mr. Epstein and is cooperating with all relevant authorities.\n\nA lawyer for Mr. Epstein declined to comment.\n\nMr. Epstein amassed a fortune of more than $500 million over three decades through close relationships with several billionaire clients, including Mr. Black, who has said he hired Mr. Epstein for personal tax and estate advice. Mr. Black, the chief executive of Apollo Global Management Inc., was one of Mr. Epstein\u2019s most prominent Wall Street clients and was one of a small number who had connections with Mr. Epstein after the guilty plea that were documented in public records.\n\nJeffrey Epstein, left, and Leon Black, right in 2005.

Some of the reported donations never materialized, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal and people familiar with the matter.\n\nGratitude America\u2019s activity could be of particular interest to federal investigators because transactions took place within the past five years\u2014within the statute of limitations for fraud charges\u2014and because they involved some of his closest associates. Two of his personal lawyers were on the foundation\u2019s board, and his longtime accountant served as president. One of those lawyers, Darren Indyke, was named co-executor of Mr. Epstein\u2019s estate in Virgin Islands court.\n\nTax records for Gratitude America show Mr. Indyke served as treasurer or vice president of the foundation since its 2012 founding.\n\nMr. Epstein was listed as Gratitude America\u2019s president in the foundation\u2019s 2012 incorporation records and in tax filings in several subsequent years. Although his name wasn\u2019t listed on records in later years, he maintained control, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nDespite Gratitude America\u2019s stated purpose, Mr. Epstein tried to use it to make a contribution to a nonprofit organization in St. Thomas, one of the U.S. Virgin Islands, in the hopes it would resolve a fine he faced from the Virgin Islands government, according to records and people familiar with the matter. If the payments were considered charitable donations, Mr. Epstein could have enjoyed a tax benefit.\n\nMr. Epstein had been cited in 2016 for violations tied to construction on Great St. James, one of his two private islands in the Virgin Islands. Instead of Mr. Epstein sending checks to the Virgin Islands government, Gratitude America and another Epstein foundation each wrote a $160,000 check to a Virgin Islands nonprofit, the St. Thomas Historical Trust, according to records. The Gratitude America check came from a Deutsche Bank account, and both checks were signed by Mr. Indyke, the records show.\n\nRepresentatives of the St. Thomas Historical Trust said they never received the checks and weren\u2019t aware of the checks\u2019 existence until media reports this past summer.\n\nMr. Epstein had been cited in 2016 for violations tied to construction on Great St. James, one of his two private islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The settlement had to be paid to the department.\u201d\n\nMr. Indyke later signed a check to the department, from the other Epstein foundation, to cover the fine, the records show.\n\nA person familiar with the transactions said the checks to the trust, which were issued at the orders of Mr. Epstein, stemmed from a misunderstanding: The department had called for some of the settlement to go toward a local preservation project, which Mr. Epstein thought was handled by the historical trust.\n\nSome organizations listed as recipients of donations from Gratitude America said they didn\u2019t receive money from the charity.\n\nGratitude America\u2019s 2017 tax return says it made a $15,000 contribution to an Elton John charity with the same address as the Elton John AIDS Foundation. In a 2014 press release from a different Epstein foundation, Mr. Epstein is described as providing funding for the Elton John AIDS Foundation.\n\nThe Elton John AIDS Foundation has no record of a contribution from Mr. Epstein, Gratitude America or any organization affiliated with him, a spokesman for the Elton John nonprofit said. The spokesman couldn\u2019t explain the 2014 press release, but said the Epstein foundation retracted it within days.\n\nGratitude America said it made a $75,000 donation to the Cancer Research Wellness Institute in California, according to the foundation\u2019s 2017 tax return. A representative at the California nonprofit said it never received money from Gratitude America or any Epstein-connected entities.\n\nOn its 2016 and 2017 tax returns, Gratitude America listed donations to 27 entities, though some of them, including the Icahn School of Medicine, said they received donations from Mr. Epstein, but not from Gratitude America. A person close to the Bruce and Marsha Moskowitz Foundation confirmed it had received three $50,000 transfers from Mr. Epstein from 2015 to 2017. But the contributions are cited in the foundation\u2019s tax returns as coming from Jeffrey Epstein/HBRK Assoc., a business in New York, not Gratitude America.\n\nDeutsche Bank played a key role in Mr. Epstein\u2019s financial dealings in recent years, helping him move millions of dollars in cash and securities through dozens of accounts, the Journal previously reported. The Gratitude America account, held with the German bank\u2019s New York-based U.S. subsidiary, was among those the bank cut off in recent months, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nDeutsche Bank played a key role in Mr. Epstein\u2019s financial dealings in recent years.

Deutsche Bank managers knew Gratitude America was affiliated with Mr. Epstein, and the bank\u2019s policy would have been to monitor the foundation\u2019s cash flows closely, one of the people familiar with the matter said.\n\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s day-to-day relationship with Mr. Epstein was overseen by New York banker Stewart Oldfield, who joined Deutsche Bank in 2014 from Credit Suisse Group AG , according to people close to the bank. He advises wealthy and institutional clients, and inherited the Epstein relationship from another banker roughly three years ago, one of the people said. That banker, Paul Morris, left Deutsche Bank and is now with Bank of America\u2019s Merrill Private Wealth Management in Manhattan, the person said.\n\nMr. Oldfield was closely involved in the decision late last year to sever Deutsche Bank\u2019s relationship with Mr. Epstein, one of the people said. Mr. Oldfield declined to comment through a bank spokesman.\n\n\u2014Miriam Gottfried contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Rebecca Davis O\u2019Brien at Rebecca.OBrien@wsj.com and Jenny Strasburg at jenny.strasburg@wsj.com", "description": "The money that flowed through Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s nonprofit, Gratitude America, followed an opaque path that appears to be designed to generate tax benefits.", "authors": ["Rebecca Davis O Brien", "Jenny Strasburg", "Rebecca.Obrien Wsj.Com", "Jenny.Strasburg Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105944/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
