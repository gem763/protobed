Apollo, founded in 1990, already has $319 billion in committed capital. Some $77 billion of that is in private equity funds, including $24.7 billion for its latest portfolio, Fund IX, which was closed in 2017.", "description": "Private equity can still find 'diamonds in the rough': Apollo exec", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8I23B_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
