In June, the NBA signed a five-year partnership with Tencent worth about $1.5 billion, the state-run CGTN news reported.\n\nThe Toyota Center in Houston, home of the Rockets.

He added, however, that it was \"not the role of the NBA to adjudicate\" people's differences in opinion.\n\n\"One of the enduring strengths of the NBA is our diversity,\" he said. \"It is inevitable that people around the world - including from America and China - will have different viewpoints over different issues. It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences.\"\n\nHe added: \"However, the NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way.\"\n\nThe pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong continue to rage into their 18th week, with demonstrations becoming increasingly violent. Last week the police shot an 18-year-old in the chest in their first use of live ammunition since June, and demonstrators threw acid at officers.\n\nRead more: Barricades, human chains, and battling tear gas: We followed Hong Kong activists through the city's most turbulent protests yet\n\nCarrie Lam, the city's leader, said on Tuesday that while she still wanted demonstrations to end peacefully, the Chinese military could step in if the uprising \"becomes so bad.\"\n\nNOW WATCH: Popular Videos from Insider Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a968542aae60519008b45ea-1136-852.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
