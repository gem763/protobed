But it refused to rule on the merits of that order, instead saying new evidence in the case required that the process be restarted in a lower court.\n\nThe case is the first major test of a new federal law that bolsters the ability of journalists to protect confidential sources.\n\nDenis spoke with As it Happens host Carol Off about the ruling. Here is part of their conversation.\n\nWhat was the reaction at Enqu\u00eate, your place of work, when you got the news today?\n\nOur lawyers came down, and we were all in the conference room, and we just cheered and applauded. It was a very great, great, great moment.\n\nIt represents that the highest court in the country says that the protection of the sources is important. And it has to be in the highest public interest to force a journalist to reveal their sources.\n\nAnd the main thing is that it says that ... the new law that was adopted by Parliament two years ago, it's the first interpretation, and it goes in the direction of giving an increased protection. And that's very important.\n\nAnd the language used by it, by the judges, is very strong to describe the paramount importance of investigative journalism, and the protection of the sources.\n\nDenis argues that sources need to be able to trust journalists, and police surveillance undermines that confidence. (CBC)\n\nYou're talking about the Journalistic Sources Protection Act that was passed two years ago, and not yet tested until [this] 8-1 ruling from the Supreme Court. What did they say about why this is important?\n\nIt's clearly wanted by our government to go in the direction of giving additional protection [to confidential sources]. And that was [what] was so bad about the decision of the Superior Court of Quebec, because the judge of the Superior Court said no, the new law doesn't change anything.\n\nAnd the Supreme Court says it changes everything because the burden of proving you don't have to reveal a source is not anymore on the journalist's shoulder. It's on the party that wants to force the journalist to testify on their sources.\n\nAnd and it's a big burden \u2014 because it has to be in the case of complete necessity, and in the highest public interest. And that said that the judges of the Supreme Court say that protecting the sources [is] also of a great public interest for our country.\n\nSo that's what's new and so important \u2014 and historic, I would say \u2014 about this decision.\n\nSo basically the onus is on the law \u2014 the police or the courts \u2014 to prove that they have to have material from a journalist, and not the journalist who has to defend the reason why they don't turn over the information about their sources. Is that what's changed?\n\nExactly. And in this case, we have Marc-Yvan C\u00f4t\u00e9, who is accused of corruption, fraud. And he wants a stay of the proceedings. And he alleges that there was some kind of a plot to move from the justice system to leak confidential documents to me in order to deprive him of a fair trial.\n\nAnd in this case, my story was presented even four years before he was even arrested. So the judge, [Rosalie] Abella, she goes even further. In her view, there's no way that I should have to testify to reveal my sources in such a case.\n\nMarc-Yvan C\u00f4t\u00e9, former Quebec transport minister is seen in a frame grab from the video feed in 2014 in Montreal, at the Charbonneau inquiry into corruption in the Quebec construction industry. (Canadian Press/Charbonneau Commission)\n\nBut it's not over yet, is it? I mean, the court is now sending you back to trial to consider what the prosecution says is new evidence. So what does that tell you about how police and prosecutors are regarding this ruling?\n\nThe Public Ministry says they have new evidence in an investigation about leaks in the media of various police documents. And they said very little, but they said that if we wait to see what's the outcome of this investigation, there will be little or no need to have me testify.\n\nNobody knows what's the new evidence for now.\n\nBut I'm not very worried because there's going be a steep hill with that decision of the Supreme Court today to prove that it's in the higher public interest to have me testify about my sources than not.\n\nWith files from The Canadian Press.
