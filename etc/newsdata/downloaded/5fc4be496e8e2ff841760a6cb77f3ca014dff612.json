Such a system would allow financial firms to borrow cash from the Fed as needed at a fixed rate.", "description": "Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida gave little away on Thursday about the U.S. central bank's next steps on monetary policy, saying the U.S. consumer and economy are in a \"good place,\" the labor market is \"very healthy,\" and interest rates will be decided one policy meeting at a time.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
