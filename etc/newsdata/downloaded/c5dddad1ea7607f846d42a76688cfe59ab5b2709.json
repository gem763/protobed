Retina-X is just one of a slew of companies that sell such services, marketing them to everyday users\u2014as opposed to law enforcement or intelligence agencies. Some critics call these apps \u201cStalkerware.\u201d\n\nAs Motherboard showed last year, some of these companies specifically market themselves as tools to catch cheating spouses without them knowing, or consenting. And even those who don\u2019t, such as Retina-X, still have users who employ their apps for that illegal purpose\u2014when a hacker first breached the company in 2017, data provided to Motherboard contained intercepted text messages indicating the malware was being used to spy non-consensually on some victims.\n\nIn its announcement, the company admitted that a hacker accessed and exposed \u201csome photographic material\u201d of two of its apps, TeenShield and PhoneSheriff. But added that \u201cNo personal data was accessed.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a result, and to protect our valued customers, Retina-X Studios is immediately and indefinitely halting its PhoneSheriff, TeenShield, SniperSpy and Mobile Spy products. We will be offering pro-rated refunds to any customers who currently have a contract with Retina-X Studios for these services,\u201d the message continued.\n\nA screenshot of Retina-X\u2019s homepage, as of March 6, 2018.\n\nOn February 16, Motherboard reported that the same vigilante hacker who had hacked into Retina-X last year had done it again. The hacker proved to Motherboard that he was able to see all customer\u2019s photos from a poorly protected cloud storage server. He said he then wiped the server, just like he had done the year before, when he broke into the company and gained access to pretty much everything, including gigabytes of customer data.\n\nAt the time, Retina-X denied there had been a data breach. Now, the company not only admitted the breach but also lashed out at the hacker.\n\n\u201cThe perpetrators of these illegal acts have been motivated by their unfounded opposition to the private activities of parents and employers on devices they own and with the consent of users of the devices. The perpetrators, who will likely never be identified or brought to justice, have shared their actions with online publications to gain attention. They are cowards who work in the dark and use the media to promote their agenda.\u201d\n\nRead more: When Spies Come Home, Motherboard\u2019s ongoing investigation into \u201cStalkerware\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why Retina-X decided to take such a dramatic decision this year and not last year, when the hacker accessed much more than just their cloud storage servers. A spokesperson for Retina-X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nLast year, the hacker shared some hacked data with Motherboard, showing that he had access to Retina-X\u2019s customer email addresses and some plaintext and hashed passwords; the alleged GPS locations of thousands of surveillance targets; and data taken from target\u2019s phones and computers, such as photos, text messages, emails, and contacts.\n\nThe hacker said he was \u201cpleased\u201d that the company is taking down services \u201cthat violate privacy and enable abuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they genuinely improve their security and come back, that's still an improvement over the previous situation where sensitive data was up on the internet for any attacker to grab. If they go down permanently, that's even better,\u201d the hacker told Motherboard in an encrypted chat. \u201cOr maybe they'll just resurface under another name, in which case I'll be watching.\u201d\n\nGet six of our favorite Motherboard stories every day by signing up for our newsletter.\n\n", "description": "A company that sells spyware or \u201cstalkerware\u201d for everyday users has ceased operations of its handful of apps that monitor computers and cellphones.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5a9ed935273ac500064bdd78/lede/1520360884043-IMG_4152.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.7489xh;0xw,0.033xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2018-03-06"}
