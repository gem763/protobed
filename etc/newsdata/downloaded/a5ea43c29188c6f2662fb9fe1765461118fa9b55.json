Coach Joe Schmidt decided not to risk it.\n\nMeanwhile, Japan brought back fit-again regular No. 8 Amanaki Lelei Mafi, and gave the captaincy to flanker Pieter Labuschagne while regular skipper Michael Leitch was dropped into the reserves.\n\nSexton, the 2018 world player of the year, received a bang to his quad against Scotland last Sunday and ceded goalkicking to scrumhalf Conor Murray. He was replaced with victory secured, didn\u2019t train fully this week, and missed out on selection on Thursday for the Japan game on Saturday.\n\nIreland gave a second start at 10 to Jack Carty in his first international season, and backed him with Joey Carbery, who has recovered from an ankle ligament injury sustained more than two months ago against Italy.\n\n\u201cJohnny\u2019s never happy about being left out, he\u2019s always looking to play, but he had a good hit-out against Scotland, played through 55 minutes and got a bit of mileage under his belt there,\u201d Schmidt said.\n\n\u201cWe thought about his security off the bench but we also have a lot of time for Jack and wanted to get him involved as well. It just means we take the pressure off Johnny this week.\u201d\n\nCarty helped Ireland finish off Scotland 27-3 in Yokohama, and was impressive.\n\n\u201cJack\u2019s very calm, he doesn\u2019t get ruffled easily, he doesn\u2019t get distracted by an error he might make, or people trying to put pressure on him,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cSo he stays in the zone very well.\u201d\n\nCarty was one of four changes to the starting lineup, all of them in the backline.\n\nFullback Rob Kearney and wing Keith Earls shook off calf and thigh issues which prevented their availability against Scotland, and Chris Farrell was at inside center for Bundee Aki, who completed head injury assessments and was training fully, but not worth risking.\n\nFlanker Peter O\u2019Mahony failed a head injury assessment during the Scotland match but passed the concussion protocols afterwards and was picked in an unchanged forward pack. O\u2019Mahony was to have sat out the match until Jack Conan hurt his foot in training when a teammate stood on it and he couldn\u2019t train fully.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no elevated risk, we don\u2019t believe, in selecting Pete,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve got a super medical staff.\u201d\n\nJapan made six changes, two of them positional, to the starting side that beat Russia 30-10 on opening night.\n\nLeitch, prop Asaeli Ai Valu, lock Wimpie van der Walt, and wing Lomano Lava Lemeki were dropped to the reserves.\n\nMafi was back after recovering from a shoulder injury against South Africa in the last World Cup warmup three weeks ago.\n\nProp Jiwon Koo, lock Luke Thompson - the oldest player in this World Cup at 38 - and fullback Ryohei Yamanaka come up from the reserves.\n\nWilliam Tupou was switched from fullback to wing for the first time in his test career, in place of Lemeki, and Kazuki Himeno was switched from No. 8 to flanker in place of Leitch.\n\nLabuschagne, of South African heritage, becomes the third foreign-born player to captain Japan in a World Cup match.\n\n___\n\nLineups:\n\nJapan: Ryohei Yamanaka, Kotaro Matsushima, Timothy Lafaele, Ryoto Nakamura, William Tupou, Yu Tamura, Yutaka Nagare; Amanaki Lelei Mafi, Pieter Labuschagne (captain), Kazuki Himeno, James Moore, Luke Thompson, Jiwon Koo, Shota Horie, Keita Inagaki. Reserves: Atsushi Sakate, Isileli Nakajima, Asaeli Ai Valu, Wimpie van der Walt, Michael Leitch, Fumiaki Tanaka, Rikiya Matsuda, Lomano Lava Lemeki.\n\nIreland: Rob Kearney, Keith Earls, Garry Ringrose, Chris Farrell, Jacob Stockdale, Jack Carty, Conor Murray; CJ Stander, Josh van der Flier, Peter O\u2019Mahony, James Ryan, Iain Henderson, Tadhg Furlong, Rory Best (captain), Cian Healy. Reserves: Sean Cronin, Dave Kilcoyne, Andrew Porter, Tadhg Beirne, Rhys Ruddock, Luke McGrath, Joey Carbery, Jordan Larmour.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ireland flyhalf Jonathan Sexton was available to play against Japan in the Rugby World Cup.
