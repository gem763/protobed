There are now at least 80 XR Youth groups internationally, 55 of which are in the UK. All are made up of climate activists born after 1990, with an average member age of 16, although some are as young as 10.\n\nXR\u2019s second wave of protests in the past two weeks have led to thousands of arrests and a police crackdown, which has banned them from congregating anywhere in London. XR Youth has organised its own action as part of this, including the YouTube protest and another outside the Department for Education to campaign for better teaching about the climate crisis in schools.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Young climate activists on the roof of the entrance to the Youtube offices in London.

Growing up, her parents were engaged in Green party politics and her father, Mike Woodin, was the party\u2019s principal speaker for six years until his death from lung cancer in 2004, when she was five.\n\nAs he was a non-smoker and lived a healthy lifestyle, Woodin believes he was affected by the high levels of air pollution in Oxford where they lived. She said: \u201cHaving that exposed to me at such a young age made me reassess my priorities.\u201d\n\nShe finds that older people often compare the current climate crisis movement with the protests over nuclear weapons in the 1950s and 60s. But for her, they are not the same: \u201cWe are the first generation which has been completely united by such an existential universal threat.\u201d\n\nThat is why XR Youth is not afraid to stand its ground in the broader XR movement. Back in July, the group democratically voted against any involvement in the Heathrow disruption plans, and members have placed a greater emphasis on climate justice by working closely with the Internationalist Solidarity Network to provide support to indigenous groups and those in the global south who are the frontline of the climate crisis.\n\nHollie Andrews, 21, helped set up XR Youth earlier this year, as part of a group who felt they were not getting the support they needed as young people within the rebellion.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re challenging the main XR a lot, we\u2019re seeing what we don\u2019t like and trying to fix that with XR Youth,\u201d she said. \u201cXR isn\u2019t perfect but give us a better alternative. There isn\u2019t one, I don\u2019t think.\u201d\n\nCoverage of XR\u2019s rebellion has been dominated by the number of arrests, but the XR Youth team are keen not to glorify this. While some members perceive the threat of arrest as \u201cmeaningless\u201d in the face of such an uncertain future, others think the arrest burden should fall on older people.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Savannah Lovelock of XR Youth.\n\nXR Youth coordinator Savannah Lovelock, 20, said: \u201cAdults need to be accountable to the young people, and if that means going on the streets and getting arrested in the thousands so we can have a chance of getting to the government and saying what we think should happen, then I think that should be the strategy.\u201d\n\nFor them, the fight is not just about the climate crisis but also the system they have grown up in and the impact this has had on their mental health.\n\nDaniel Walsh, 17, is part of XR Youth London and has been arrested five times for his part in the protests. He said: \u201cYoung people already have to face the problems of social media and body image issues \u2026 and now you\u2019ve got the climate crisis to deal with as well. For some people, it has tipped them to breaking point. Certainly for me, XR has kept me alive. I was depressed before I was part of XR.\u201d\n\nReflecting back on their time in XR Youth, the members seem most proud of the communities that have been built and the friendships they\u2019ve forged through the movement.\n\n\u201cRebellion isn\u2019t just going on the street and getting arrested, it\u2019s also rebelling against a system that makes us lonely and have no purpose,\u201d said Lovelock. \u201cIt\u2019s about creating those communities where people are held in their grief and their terror of what\u2019s going on.\u201d", "description": "For young Extinction Rebellion members, there is an urgency they say others struggle to fully grasp", "authors": ["Jessica Murray"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2eb8896c121765092e224b16cca38b69ae673a42/0_277_4898_2939/master/4898.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=59ae6ef9ac00102b71bfa697e746984a", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
