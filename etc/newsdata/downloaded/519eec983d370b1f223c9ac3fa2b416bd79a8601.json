The typical store is about 300,000 square feet spread out over multiple floors, and the world\u2019s largest IKEA is a whopping 700,000 square feet.\n\nAnd massive IKEA warehouse stores, overflowing with nooks and crannies in acres of faux bedrooms, closets, kitchens, and storage areas have proven all too tempting over the years for people eager to play absolutely epic games of hide-and-seek.\n\nThe plague of IKEA hide-and-seek surfaced over the weekend at its huge store in Glasgow, Scotland. Police were called after being alerted that some 3,000 people on Facebook said they planned to mob the store for hide-and-seek. Five police officers remained at the IKEA store in Glasgow for most of the day on Saturday, trying to gauge whether suspicious-looking customers were browsing for the perfect spot to hide or genuinely pondering if a rug matched their living room.\n\n\u201cPeople are stopping everyone who looks like they are here for a game of hide and seek,\u201d someone who said they\u2019d visited the Glasgow IKEA store posted online, The Scotsman reported.\n\nIKEA says its stores cannot host hide-and-seek games because of health and safety issues. \u201cWe need to make sure people are safe, and that\u2019s hard if we don\u2019t know where they are,\u201d an IKEA spokesperson has said.\n\nIKEA officially banned hide-and-seek in 2015. During the months before the ban was instituted, tens of thousands of people had signed up online to play hide-and-seek at IKEA stores in Europe, including retail warehouses in Amsterdam, Utrecht, and Prague. IKEA had to officially ban hide-and-seek at stores in Australia too.\n\nIt seems like the IKEA hide-and-seek phenomenon hasn\u2019t hit the U.S., or at least people haven\u2019t been busted for playing in stores. Maybe that\u2019s just because the hiders are so good and the seekers are so subtle that their games haven\u2019t been detected.\n\nHonestly, we can\u2019t blame people for wanting to play hide and seek at IKEA. The place seems made for it. Heck, IKEA has even designed a \u201chide and seek playground\u201d-theme bedroom for girls. \u201cThis little girl loves hide and seek, and her bedroom is filled with flexible furniture that also conceals and reveals,\u201d IKEA\u2019s ad copy for the bedroom says. \u201cCan you guess her favorite hiding spot?\u201d", "description": "Dang.", "authors": ["Brad Tuttle"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RDLXqZ30HLY42HbjYJo4gA--~B/aD0yNTMzO3c9MzgwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/money_403/b43d77a2f93e1de2ae2e5757c6fa5d02"}
