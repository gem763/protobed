I did nothing wrong,\u201d Biden said.\n\n\u201cMy son\u2019s statement speaks for itself,\u201d Biden said, before pivoting back to Trump. \u201cWhat we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. I\u2019m proud of the judgment (Hunter) he made.\u201d\n\nThe question had been guaranteed to come up early in this debate, the first since House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry and the Trump campaign began firing back with television ads highlighting Hunter Biden\u2019s former business dealings in the Ukraine and China.\n\nWHERE IS MARIANNE?: Marianne Williamson isn't on the debate stage but reminded people she's still running\n\nHunter Biden hours earlier acknowledged he made a \"mistake\" and showed \u201cpoor judgement\u201d in not calculating the political ramifications of joining the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while his father had official business in the country as vice president. Speaking to ABC News, Hunter Biden denied doing anything \"improper\" in Ukraine.\n\nSome Democrats saw the flap as a chance for Joe Biden to hit back at Trump, including by noting that Trump\u2019s children also have overseas business tied to Donald Trump\u2019s real estate empire. The former vice president didn't raise the issue.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/15/democratic-debate-joe-biden-dodges-question-sons-ukraine-interest/3992266002/", "description": "democratic-debate-joe-biden-hunter-biden-question", "authors": ["John Fritze", "Published P.M.
