The plan involves selling illiquid and unlisted shares, which are hard to sell quickly at a good price because there are fewer potential buyers.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.\n\nIn the three-minute clip Mr Woodford said he was \u201cextremely sorry that we\u2019ve had to take this decision\u201d, and added: \u201cWhen it is appropriate we will open the fund so that you can buy and sell as normal.\n\n\u201cAs difficult a decision as this is, and clearly frustrating for you, our investors, we felt that this was necessary to protect your interests.\n\n\u201cThe situation that we confronted was that we were seeing a lot of outflow in the portfolio. As a result of that increased level of redemptions, what we were seeing was the stock market in a way anticipating the fact that we would have to be sellers of stocks to meet those redemptions.\n\n\u201cWe felt that the prices that we would have to achieve in order to meet those redemptions would be disadvantageous for our investors.\u201d\n\nMajor investors in the fund were reportedly given no prior warning that they would be prevented from withdrawing their cash.\n\nWoodford Investment Management put the suspension in place hours after Kent County Council attempted to withdraw \u00a3263m on Monday.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The episode marks a new nadir for a man feted in the City as someone who could consistently deliver big returns for large numbers of retail investors.\n\nMr Woodford has commanded multimillion-pound pay packages over the years, including the \u00a337m he shared with his firm\u2019s chief executive Craig Newman in January despite a dismal year.\n\nShares in Mr Woodford\u2019s listed investment trust plunged on Tuesday after it emerged the flagship portfolio had been frozen.\n\nWoodford Patient Capital Trust\u2019s shares are down 9 per cent this week, having fallen as much as 21 per cent at one stage on Tuesday.\n\nShares of other stocks that count Mr Woodford\u2019s fund among their biggest investors also fell heavily after the move, with construction giant Kier Group down 6 per cent on the FTSE 250.\n\nAnd fund supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown saw shares drop 5 per cent on the FTSE 100 after it said it could no longer include the Woodford Equity Income Fund or Woodford Income Focus Fund on its \u201cWealth 50\u201d list, which is used by thousands of customers to decide where to invest.\n\nIn the video Mr Woodford said the Focus Fund remained \u201copen as normal\u201d to buying and selling, and it had no exposure to the same illiquid and unquoted securities.\n\nHow has a star fund manager ended up in this position?\n\nLong considered one of the UK\u2019s best and most consistent stock pickers, Neil Woodford has had a bad run over the past couple of years. His strategy is a simple one and has remained the same over a three-decade career: investing for the long term in companies which he considers to be undervalued.\n\nIn the past he has been very good at this. But he has recently backed a number of firms whose shares have tanked, including construction and outsourcing firm Kier, which said last week that it would perform significantly worse than they told investors at the start of the year. Shares crashed 41 per cent.\n\nMr Woodford has also been criticised for investing in some illiquid and unlisted shares despite the fact investors in his fund can withdraw their cash at any time. As performance has soured and big clients like Kent County Council have sought to pull out their money, the fund has had to sell assets to meet payout requests.\n\nIlliquid assets must be heavily discounted in order to sell them quickly, deepening the losses for Mr Woodford\u2019s fund. He is now going to unwind those positions and focus exclusively on listed shares which are easy to buy and sell quickly.\n\nThe suspension buys him some time to do that but confidence in a man considered a City superstar has been severely dented. It remains to be seen how many more investors will want to pull out their cash when they have the chance to do so again.\n\nWill they still put much stock in his previous history or will they seek to cut their recent losses and run? Even a reputation as stellar as Mr Woodford\u2019s may not be enough to prevent a further exodus.", "description": "Star fund manager Neil Woodford told investors he was \u201cextremely sorry\u201d after he stopped them withdrawing their cash from his \u00a33.7bn fund.
