According to a Pew survey conducted last year, 82 percent of Europeans had no confidence in Trump\u2019s handling of international issues. Seventy-five percent of Canadians and 91 percent of Mexicans don\u2019t trust the president to do the right thing regarding world affairs. His numbers are bad even in Russia.\n\nAfter Trump promised to send \u201can armada, very powerful\u201d to deter North Korea in 2017, South Korean presidential candidate Hong Joon-pyo said, \u201cIf that was a lie, then during Trump\u2019s term, South Korea will not trust whatever Trump says.\u201d It was a lie. The U.S. Navy posted a photograph six days later of the fleet heading in the opposite direction.\n\nLesson: So long as Trump is president, the United States cannot be trusted.\n\nTrump\u2019s foreign policy mirrors his personal behavior. It is erratic, unreliable, duplicitous, greedy, shortsighted, self-destructive, easily manipulated, unprincipled, and callous. The key to understanding it is understanding him. Lacking a coherent worldview, Trump mines his own insecurities for material and projects them onto the United States, which he casts as a perennial victim of other countries\u2019 cunning and conniving.", "description": "", "authors": ["Windsor Mann", "Theweek.Com Articles Note-Republicans-Trump-Betray-Just-Like-Betrayed-Kurds"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
