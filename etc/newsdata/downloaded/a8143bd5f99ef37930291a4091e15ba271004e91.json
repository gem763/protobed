Namibia is the lowest-ranked team at the tournament and is up against the two-time champions.\n\nThe Springboks are looking to rebound from an opening loss to New Zealand in Pool B. Namibia was brave before going down to Italy. Japan\u2019s biggest previous biggest win at the Rugby World Cup was an upset over the Springboks in England four years ago.\n\nSchalk Brits captains South Africa against Namibia. Normally a hooker, Brits will play at No. 8 as South Africa made 13 changes to its team following the New Zealand game, resting most of its front-line players against the minnow of the World Cup.\n\nNamibia, the Springboks\u2019 southern African neighbor, has never won a Rugby World Cup game in 20 attempts.\n\n___\n\n6:15 p.m.\n\nJapan has produced another Rugby World Cup shocker to beat an Ireland team that was ranked No. 1 coming into the tournament.\n\nJapan beat South Africa in the 2015 World Cup in what was considered the biggest upset in the tournament\u2019s history. The 19-12 win over Ireland on Saturday is another massive result, particularly for the first Rugby World Cup held in Asia.\n\nJapan leads Pool A with wins over Russia and Ireland. The Irish had opened with an emphatic 27-3 win over Scotland and had been a heavy favorite to win at Shizuoka.\n\n___\n\n5:30 p.m.\n\nCaptain Jack Lam will return at No. 8 among four changes Samoa coach Vaeluaga Steve Jackson made to his starting XV to play Scotland amid a series of injuries and suspensions.\n\nHooker Ray Niuia, scrumhalf Melani Matavao and winger Belgium Tuatagaloa all come into the starting XV in changes from Samoa\u2019s opening win over Russia.\n\nLam will make his World Cup captaincy debut against Scotland 28 years after his cousin, Pat Lam, led Samoa at the 1991 World Cup.\n\nBackrower Afaesetiti Amosa has been ruled out after rupturing a right knee ligament, and center Rey Lee-Lo and hooker Motu Matu\u2019u each received three-match bans for dangerous tackles against Russia to rule them out of the rest of the group stage.\n\nSamoa: Tim Nanai-Williams, Belgium Tuatagaloa, Alapati Leiua, Henry Taefu, Ed Fidow, Tusi Pisi, Melani Matavao; Jack Lam (captain), . TJ Ioane, Chris Vui, Kane Le\u2019aupepe, Teofilo Paulo, Michael Alaalatoa, Ray Niuia, Logovii Mulipola. Reserves: Seilala Lam, Paul Alo-Emile, Jordan Lay, Piula Faasalele, Josh Tyrell, Pele Cowley, Ulupano Seuteni, Kieron Fonotia.\n\n___\n\n5:05 p.m.\n\nIreland leads Japan 12-9, two tries to three penalties, at halftime of their Pool A match in Shizuoka.\n\nFlyhalf Jack Carty, in place for the injured Jonathan Sexton, was directing Ireland with veteran confidence as he set up both of their tries.\n\nHis crosskick to center Garry Ringrose was pinpoint to the center to catch and score, and his chip was tapped back by Ringrose over shorter opposite Ryoto Nakamura for fullback Rob Kearney to catch and dive to the tryline.\n\nThe Irish led 12-3 after 21 minutes, and spent the rest of the half on defense as Japan probed the outside and pushed Ireland off its scrum ball for the reward of two more Yu Tamura penalty kicks.\n\n___\n\n3:45 p.m.\n\nJamie Joseph has been forced to make last-minute changes to his Japan squad to face Ireland at the Rugby World Cup.\n\nLomano Lemeki was moved from the bench to the left wing to replace William Tupou, who usually plays center or fullback but was named on the wing in the original squad for Saturday\u2019s Pool A game at Shizuoka.\n\nKenki Fukuoka was drafted onto the reserves bench as cover. Japan won the tournament opener against Russia. Ireland opened its campaign with a lopsided win over Scotland.\n\nRevised Japan lineup: Ryohei Yamanaka, Kotaro Matsushima, Timothy Lafaele, Ryoto Nakamura, Lomano Lemeki, Yu Tamura, Yutaka Nagare; Amanaki Lelei Mafi, Pieter Labuschagne (captain), Kazuki Himeno, James Moore, Luke Thompson, Jiwon Koo, Shota Horie, Keita Inagaki. Reserves: Atsushi Sakate, Isileli Nakajima, Asaeli Ai Valu, Wimpie van der Walt, Michael Leitch, Fumiaki Tanaka, Rikiya Matsuda, Kenki Fukuoka.\n\n___\n\n3:40 p.m.\n\nThree tries from hooker Julian Montoya helped Argentina to a bonus-point 28-12 win over Tonga in their must-win Rugby World Cup Pool C game.\n\nArgentina led 28-0, with left winger Santiago Carreras getting the other try and flyhalf Benjamin Urdapilleta converting them all as a rout looked on the cards.\n\nBut Tonga hit back with two fine tries from fullback Telusa Veainu, who looked sharp on his return from a nagging foot injury.\n\nArgentina lost its opening game to France and plays group leader England next Saturday, while Tonga faces France the following day.\n\nThis was a comfortable win for the Pumas, but the way Tonga got back into the game and pushed hard for a third try late on might concern Argentina coach Mario Ledesma.\n\n___\n\n3:10 p.m.\n\nScotland coach Gregor Townsend has made five changes to his starting lineup to play Samoa in a Rugby World Cup Pool A match on Monday.\n\nThe Scots are coming off a 27-3 opening loss to Ireland and need a victory to push for a place in the quarterfinals.\n\nA new backrow trio will start, with Jamie Ritchie replacing injured Hamish Watson on the openside, Magnus Bradbury coming onto the blindside of the scrum and Blade Thomson at No. 8.\n\nThe two other changes were in the backs, where Darcy Graham will start on the wing and Chris Harris in the centers at the expense of Tommy Seymour and Duncan Taylor.\n\n\u201cWe were well below (our best) level against Ireland,\u201d Townsend said. \u201cThe players know what is required of them and are hungry to deliver the kind of performance that keeps us in the World Cup.\n\n\u201cThe reality is we now have to win our next three games to make it out of our pool, so the knockout stages for us begin this Monday night.\u201d\n\nGreig Laidlaw and Finn Russell will start a test in the halves together for the 35th time, equaling the Scotland record held by Roy Laidlaw (Greig\u2019s uncle) and John Rutherford.\n\nScotland: Stuart Hogg, Darcy Graham, Chris Harris, Sam Johnson, Sean Maitland, Finn Russell, Greig Laidlaw; Blade Thomson, Jamie Ritchie, Magnus Bradbury, Jonny Gray, Grant Gilchrist, Willem Nel, Stuart McInally (captain), Allan Dell. Reserves: Fraser Brown, Gordon Reid, Zander Fagerson, Scott Cummings, Ryan Wilson, George Horne, Adam Hastings, Duncan Taylor.\n\n___\n\n2:35 p.m.\n\nHooker Julian Montoya scored a hat trick of tries to help Argentina lead Tonga 28-7 at halftime in their must-win Rugby World Cup Pool C game.\n\nSelected ahead of former captain Agustin Creevy, Montoya opened the scoring with a try in the right corner.\n\nApproaching the midway point he had his second of the game, when Tonga\u2019s pack was easily pushed back and he went over for another converted score.\n\nCoach Mario Ledesma\u2019s selection changes worked, with left winger Santiago Carreras intercepting a sloppy Tonga pass and running clear for the third try for 21-0 after 21 minutes.\n\nPoor Tonga defending enabled Montoya enough space to push his hulking frame over the line for the bonus-point fourth try - and with not even 30 minutes played.\n\nThe Tongans rallied late in the half with their first try of the tournament and went within inches of scoring again in the last seconds before the break.\n\n___\n\n2 p.m.\n\nGeorgia coach Milton Haig says the decision to make 12 changes to his starting lineup between Rugby World Cup games between Wales and Uruguay was four years in the making.\n\nGeorgia is coming off an opening loss to Six Nations champion Wales, and Uruguay opened with a 30-27 upset win over Fiji.\n\nThe Fijians also had made a dozen changes to the starting lineup between their first and second games, and were caught off guard by Uruguay.\n\n\u201cWhen we planned this four years ago, firstly we planned that we needed to make sure we had a strong 31 coming to this tournament,\u201d Haig said. \u201cIt was important that there was competition for places and that there wasn\u2019t a big difference between the starting team for game one and the starting team for game two.\n\n\u201cWe knew we were going to have short turnarounds and \u2026 we don\u2019t really see a lot of significance between what team went out against Wales and what team goes out here.\u201d\n\nHaving said that, all bets are off after game two.\n\n\u201cWe were committed as a coaching group to give everyone a chance, and from now on it will be best players on the field,\u201d Haig said. \u201cIt just means that this team that is selected tomorrow need to go out and do a job for us.\u201d\n\n___\n\n12:00 p.m.\n\nJapan is back in the spotlight at the Rugby World Cup after kicking off with a win over Russia in the tournament\u2019s opening game.\n\nThe mission in Shizuoka on Saturday goes up a level, though, with Jamie Joseph\u2019s Japan lineup facing an Ireland squad that entered the World Cup with the No. 1 ranking and beat Six Nations rival Scotland 27-3.\n\nJapan\u2019s target at the first Rugby World Cup in Asia is to advance to the quarterfinals for the first time. That ambition will be tested fully against a strong Irish team that is favored to top Pool A.\n\nAlso, Argentina meets Tonga in Osaka in its first game since an opening loss to France in Pool C, and South Africa is aiming to rebound from its opening loss to the defending champion All Blacks when it takes on Namibia at Toyota.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Latest on Day 9 of the Rugby World Cup in Japan (all times local):", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/aptopix_japan_rugby_wcup_ireland_scotland_72711_c0-83-2000-1249_s1770x1032.jpg?dc2de1c8909ff8deb251977349395aa0414518db", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
