This also makes this octa-core processor one of the most power-efficient. The array is split into two ultra-large cores, two large and four small cores that split multitasking efficiently and responsibly to have the best performance without compromising on battery life\n\nPowerful GPU to game all-day\n\nThe processor comes paired with a massive 16-core Mali-G76 GPU to take down power-hungry gaming titles with ease. It works in tandem with Kirin Gaming+ 2.0 that delivers a non-obstructing gaming experience while optimising battery life.\n\nIt supports 5G!\n\nKirin 990's chipset comes with a blazing fast 5G modem built-in that not just occupies a smaller space but also helps in saving battery, thanks to the architecture (since 5G is known to drain a ton of battery, under immense loads). Kirin 990 delivers a peak downlink rate of 2.3 Gigabits per second and peak uplink rate of 1.25 Gigabits per second.\n\nDon't Miss 1.6 K SHARES 1.8 K SHARES 898 SHARES\n\nNeural Processing Unit for AI prowess\n\nKirin 990 comes equipped with a dual-core NPU or Neural Processing Unit based on the Da Vinci Architecture. Here too it utilises one large core and one smaller core to split the multitasking depending on the performance requirement, to deliver optimal battery performance.\n\nHuawei\n\nUpgraded ISP\n\nISP or Image Signalling Processor converts the image captured by the phone's camera in a digital form by enhancing and fixing blemishes and lighting. Huawei has upgraded the ISP on the Kirin 990 to bring in 3D filtering, professional level noise reduction, to enhance the overall image quality, especially in low light. It also supports real-time video rendering and post-processing.", "description": "Chinese smartphone maker Huawei is known to create some really powerful processors that have powered its smartphones in the past, and now it has unveiled its latest and greatest processor line-up till date -- Kirin 990 Series which is equipped on the newly unveiled Huawei Mate 30 and the Mate 30 Pro.
