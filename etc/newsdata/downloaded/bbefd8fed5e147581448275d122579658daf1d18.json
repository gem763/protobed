His daughter didn\u2019t get into USC.\n\nProsecutors had sought an even longer sentence of 15 months in addition to a $95,000 fine, according to the report.\n\nIn court, Huneeus said he was \u201cdeeply ashamed\u201d of participating in the scheme and apologized, ABC 7 News reported.\n\n\u201cThe consequences of my actions to those closest to me have been devastating,\u201d he said, reading a statement. \u201cThe public shame and notoriety I have thrust upon them has impacted them all. I have damaged and humiliated my family. My friends and the amazing people I had the privilege to work with in our business are all victims of my actions. I have harmed and disappointed everyone who loved me or cared about me. I am sorry, and I will do better.\u201d\n\nAnother parent who participated in the scheme, Connecticut lawyer Gordon Caplan, was sentenced to one month in prison and fined $50,000 earlier this week. Last month, parent Devin Sloane was sentenced to four months. Stephen Semprevivo also received a four-month sentence.
