Property losses in the Bahamas could hit $7 billion.\n\n\"We expect (the death toll) to rise,\" Health Minister Duane Sands said late Friday in a text message to The Associated Press.\n\nSecurity Minister Marvin Dames said authorities are striving to reach everyone, but the crews can't just bulldoze their way through fallen trees and other rubble because there might be bodies not yet recovered.\n\n\"We have been through this before, but not at this level of devastation,\" Dames said. \"These are very serious times and very sensitive times.\"\n\nThe storm also left its mark in the record books in other ways:\n\nAs of Friday, with its landfall in North Carolina, Dorian has been a hurricane for a total of nine days. This is longer than most Atlantic storms: Klotzbach said that only about 10% of all Atlantic hurricanes last longer than eight days.\n\nWhile this may seem like a lot, it's still a long way from the record of 19.5 days, which was set by Hurricane Ginger in 1971, according to Klotzbach. Ginger took a long and loopy path around the Atlantic before finally making landfall in North Carolina in late September 1971.\n\nIn addition, Dorian has been a named storm for 13 days, which includes its first few days as a tropical storm. That places it in a tie for 5th place for most storm days by an Atlantic hurricane that formed in August, Klotzbach said.\n\nWhat's in name? Here's how naming hurricanes works\n\nBecause of the death and destruction caused by Dorian, the storm's name will almost certainly be retired by the World Meteorological Organization, the United Nations' group that determines which hurricane names will be used in upcoming years.\n\nA nation hardest hit by a storm can request its name be removed because the storm was so deadly or costly that future use of the name would be insensitive. The names of two of last year's most destructive storms \u2013 Florence and Michael \u2013 were retired by the WMO earlier this year.\n\nContributing: Associated Press\n\nReach Doyle Rice at @USATODAYWeather.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Hurricane Dorian facts: Storm is strongest hurricane to hit Bahamas", "description": "It's now certain that Hurricane Dorian's lasting legacy will be its slow, torturous rampage as a Category 5 monster across the Bahamas.", "authors": ["Doyle Rice", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SByd0XgfHRDh5jh9Ro7FDg--~B/aD00NDgwO3c9NjcyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/7b5a90a59ee4f2b51ce38a39ab0f2aba", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
