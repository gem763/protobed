Behar, meanwhile, wanted to know why the administration decided to make this move now.\n\n\u201cHe ran on isolationism, which again, I think is bad for a whole variety of reasons,\" McCain replied, before suggesting it could \u201cbe a wag the dog situation\u201d in order to distract the public from the Ukraine scandal.\n\nLater on, with the panel noting that Trump\u2019s defenders seem far more upset about the Syria pullout than Trump asking a foreign leader to interfere in our elections, McCain pointed out that she feels the same way.\n\n\u201cI am more upset than the Ukraine call about this,\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cI don\u2019t care what that makes me.\u201d\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
