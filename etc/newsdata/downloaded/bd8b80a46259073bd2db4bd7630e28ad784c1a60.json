The company has scheduled an earnings call for 8 a.m. Eastern time.\n\n...", "description": "Wall Street analysts expect Biogen to report quarterly earnings of $8.28 per share, and sales of $3.5 billion, according to FactSet.", "authors": ["Josh Nathan-Kazis"], "top_image": "https://asset.barrons.com/public/resources/images/ON-DG891_Biogen_OR_20191018120417.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
