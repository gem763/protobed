The deal would then be voted on by Parliament on Saturday, the first time Parliament will have been in session on a Saturday since the Falklands War.\n\nAn unnamed insider told The Sunday Times: \u201cHe\u2019ll be talking to Merkel, Macron and Juncker by the end of Monday to see if there\u2019s agreement on a \u2018landing zone\u2019 for Northern Ireland and customs. The message is: \u2018Let\u2019s finish this off.\u2019 The alternative is to agree a friendly version of no deal and finish it that way.\u201d\n\nAfter negotiations had stalled, a sense of optimism was restored when a meeting was held last week between Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar, at a wedding venue in the Wirral that once hosted Coleen Rooney\u2019s 21st birthday party.\n\nPM @BorisJohnson\u2019s joint statement with Taoiseach Varadkar. pic.twitter.com/pvvXiyPXj8 \u2014 UK Prime Minister (@10DowningStreet) October 10, 2019\n\nThe two leaders emerged from the working lunch proclaiming in a joint statement on Twitter: \u201cThey agreed that they could see a pathway to a possible deal.\u201d\n\nSpecific details on Johnson\u2019s proposed deal remain secret, and it remains to be seen whether the deal will be accepted or not. Johnson still faces hurdles from EU negotiators as well as MPs from Northern Ireland.\n\nNigel Dodds, the leader of the DUP in the House of Commons, told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica: \u201cThere is a lot of stuff coming from Brussels, pushed by the Europeans in the last hours, but one thing is sure: Northern Ireland must remain fully part of the UK customs union. And Boris Johnson knows it very well.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson is set to propose a final effort Brexit deal to EU leaders this week, or accept a \u201cno-deal\u201d exit on the October 31st.", "authors": ["Kurt Zindulka"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Boris-Johnson-1-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
