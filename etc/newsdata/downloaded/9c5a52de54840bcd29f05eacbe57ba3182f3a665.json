Or, put in raw numbers, Atlanta is +28 when Young has been on the court this season and -24 when he has sat.\n\nIf you need more proof of just how critical Young is to Atlanta, just watch what happened against Miami, where it was basically an even game when Young was in, but not too long after he went down the Heat went on an 11-0 run and never looked back, winning 112-97.\n\nMiami got Jimmy Butler back and he had 21 points on 5-of-11 shooting, attacking the rim and getting to the line 15 times.
