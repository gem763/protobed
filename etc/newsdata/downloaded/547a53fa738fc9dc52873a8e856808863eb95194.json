Following years of childhood sexual abuse, I was convinced that I was incapable of feeling real love.\n\nMy abuser manipulated me into loving him and this twisted love forged my understanding of romance.\n\nTo protect myself, I maintained a facade of happiness (Picture: George Douglas)\n\nAs I grew up, I associated love with pain. I did not think that I deserved genuine love. This was exaggerated by the intense PTSD symptoms I wrestled with, including extreme emotional detachment and paranoia.\n\nTo protect myself, I maintained a facade of happiness to keep everyone around me at arm\u2019s length and trusted no one \u2013 including myself.\n\nThe abuse also broke down any self-esteem I had built up. As I grew into my teenage body, I treated myself as a sexual object by ignoring my needs and desires and focusing entirely on my partner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was convinced that the only worth my body had was in the pleasure it gave other people. The concept of love never even crossed my mind.\n\nWith my first boyfriend, I grew to love him as a person but I never touched upon the depths of \u2018true love\u2019 that he expressed to me.\n\nInstead, because I thought love meant immersing yourself in another person, I let his life swallow me up. I prioritised his interests, adopted his style and built my life around his needs.\n\nWhen I ended the relationship I was done with romance. Love, I thought, was for those brave enough to share their soul with another \u2013 I couldn\u2019t fathom ever gathering the courage to do that.\n\nI rebuilt my walls and settled into a pattern of casual, emotionless sex. I found a thrill in no-strings relationships but the process was starting to do more damage than good, thanks to my utter lack of self-respect.\n\nThings finally started to change when I met my current partner four years ago. I had joined a dating app and he was the first person I swiped right on.\n\nI wanted to feel love for him, but I knew I had to love me first (Picture: George Douglas)\n\nWe had immediate chemistry and I thought he was the perfect fit for a friend with benefits.\n\nAs I had just moved away from the city he lived in, we started with texting all day, every day, for two months before we finally met. On our first date, we clicked instantly but I kept my guard up and went in expecting nothing more than a one night stand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, from that first night together, the instant connection was unlike anything I had experienced before and his knack for making me giggle like a maniac put me at ease.\n\nBefore long, we were in a relationship. I was utterly enthralled by him but I maintained my walls because I expected my heart to be broken sooner or later.\n\nOpening up to him was far from easy. Even though I could talk about anything, I had no trust or respect for myself. I wanted to feel love for him but I knew I had to love me first.\n\nI started by writing down everything I was feeling, whether it was in a journal or mashed together in terrible poetry. Expelling the dark emotions I felt helped me clear my vision.\n\nI read every self-help book I could get my hands on and identified the unhealthy thinking patterns I had developed.\n\nBreaking down those barriers felt like coming up for air after a lifetime of being buried beneath waves of grief and sadness.\n\nI began the process of tearing my walls down to their deepest foundation (Photo: George Douglas)\n\nI will be working on this for the rest of my life but examining my own psyche has been a powerful experience. I no longer feel trapped by my emotions or terrified of what I am feeling. I have built something beautiful \u2013 unreserved self-love.\n\nMy partner has played a huge role by constantly reminding me that our relationship was a safe space to be vulnerable. In time, I learned to trust and let him in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was still wary of his love but I did allow myself to reciprocate, even if I made him tell me he loved me three times before I trusted it.\n\nWe moved a lot slower than the average couple but the years we spent building a foundation gave us everything we needed to find true love in one another.\n\nFor the first time I feel hopeful in a relationship. I no longer bury my emotions to protect myself \u2013 I see strength in the intimate vulnerability we have curated together. Instead of fearing the future, I imagine one full of love.\n\nFor too long I denied myself even the slightest whisper of love. The abuse I\u2019d endured as a child had cocooned the idea of love in fear and distrust.\n\nBut I\u2019ve unearthed a part of me I never knew existed, one that finds courage in expressing emotions honestly and openly.\n\nNowadays I see the love shining out of every photo my partner takes of me \u2013 even the ones where he tries to capture the inside of my nostrils \u2013 and I surrender to it completely.\n\nTrue love is not a fairy-tale. It is equal parts vulnerability and strength.\n\nIt\u2019s not a sacrifice of one person for another \u2013 it\u2019s the enhancement of two lives through a connection built on mutual trust, respect, and honesty. It\u2019s not meant to be painful or tragic, it\u2019s meant to be restorative, beautiful and full of hope for the future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it\u2019s certainly not the nightmare love my abuser bestowed on me.\n\nFinding a love like the one I have feels unreal. Sometimes I catch myself staring at my partner in disbelief, not because I am shocked that someone chose to love me, but because I am proud of learning to choose love, and to know that I deserve it.\n\nI opened my heart and love flowed in and planted deep roots. I have no regrets because, despite living with the lifelong impact of childhood abuse, I know I\u2019m capable of true, uninhibited love.\n\nFinding it was painful but I did it.\n\nLast week in Love, Or Something Like It: My Italian wife taught me how to show love\n\nWrite for Love, Or Something Like It Love, Or Something Like It is a new series for Metro.co.uk, covering everything from mating and dating to lust and loss, to find out what love is and how to find it in the present day.
