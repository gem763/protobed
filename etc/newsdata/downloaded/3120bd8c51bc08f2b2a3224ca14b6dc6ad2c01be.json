(Rick Scuteri/AP)\n\nA former college classmate accused New England Patriots wide receiver Antonio Brown of rape and sexual assault in a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday.\n\nIn the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Miami, where Brown lives, the woman accused the star wide receiver of exposing himself and secretly masturbating behind her and ejaculating on her back in two separate incidents in 2017, and she also accused Brown of raping her in 2018.\n\nBrown denied the allegations through his attorney, who said that Brown had a \u201cconsensual personal relationship\u201d with the woman and previously declined her request for a $1.6 million business investment.\n\n\u201cMr. Brown \u2026 refuses to be the victim of what he believes to be a money grab,\u201d wrote Brown\u2019s attorney, Darren Heitner.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the civil lawsuit that was filed earlier today against Antonio Brown, as well as the response by Antonio\u2019s representatives,\u201d the Patriots said in a statement late Tuesday night. \u201cWe take these allegations very seriously. . . . The league has informed us that they will be investigating. We will have no further comment while that investigation takes place.\u201d\n\nThe woman \u2014 Britney Taylor, a 28-year-old gymnast \u2014 met Brown in 2010 at Central Michigan University, according to the lawsuit, when he was a senior and she was a freshman. They were in the same Christian students group, the lawsuit states, and were paired together as Bible study partners.\n\nThey reconnected in 2017, according to the lawsuit, when Brown reached out via social media, requesting Taylor work with him as a personal trainer.\n\n[Antonio Brown agrees to deal with Patriots hours after release from Raiders]\n\nAfter they met at Central Michigan, Brown left for the NFL, and Taylor transferred to LSU. In 2013, according to the lawsuit, Brown \u2014 then a wide receiver for the Pittsburgh Steelers \u2014 contacted her via social media and tried to solicit a \u201crevealing\u201d photo. She refused, and they didn\u2019t communicate again until 2017, when Brown contacted Taylor via Facebook, according to the complaint, and asked her if she would help train him. She agreed and began periodically flying to Pittsburgh or Miami to work with Brown, according to the lawsuit.\n\nDuring one of these trips to Pittsburgh in 2017, according to Taylor\u2019s lawsuit, Brown exposed his penis, then grabbed Taylor and kissed her against her will. She pushed him away, the lawsuit states, and fled the room.\n\nA few weeks later, according to the complaint, another assault occurred at the wide receiver\u2019s home in Miami. Taylor was watching a church service on her iPad, the complaint states, when Brown stood behind her, masturbated and ejaculated on her. The lawsuit attached a vulgar text message, purportedly from Brown, in which the sender of the text message makes reference to an act matching what Taylor described.\n\nTaylor ceased communicating with Brown after this incident, according to the lawsuit, until he reached back out to her in 2018, apologized and requested they resume working together. Taylor agreed, according to the suit, after getting Brown to agree in writing to \u201cstop flirting with her anymore.\u201d\n\nOn the night of May 20, 2018, according to the suit, Taylor joined Brown, another unidentified football player and a few friends for a night at a club in Miami. At the end of the night, she drove Brown back to his home and, according to the suit, he pulled her into his bedroom as she was attempting to leave and return to her hotel. Brown forced her onto the bed, the suit states, and raped her, despite her cries of \u201cno\u201d and \u201cstop.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit makes no reference to Taylor contacting police to file complaints against Brown for any of the three alleged incidents.\n\nThe Washington Post does not typically name alleged victims of sex crimes, but Taylor publicly circulated her name in the lawsuit and in a statement released Tuesday by her attorney, David Haas.\n\n\u201cDeciding to speak out has been an incredibly difficult decision,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI have found strength in my faith, my family and from the accounts of other survivors of sexual assault.\u201d\n\nIn Brown\u2019s statement, he said Taylor approached him in 2017, shortly after he signed a new contract with the Steelers paying him $17 million per year, at the time making him the highest-paid wide receiver in the NFL. Taylor requested a $1.6 million investment in a \u201cbusiness project\u201d according to Brown, and he declined.\n\nIn 2018, according to Brown, Taylor reached back out to him and offered to help him train, and they began a consensual sexual relationship.\n\n\u201cAny sexual interaction with Mr. Brown was entirely consensual,\u201d wrote Heitner, his attorney.\n\nBrown could be subject to disciplinary action by the league under its personal conduct policy. The NFL generally waits until a legal case has been resolved in court before deciding whether to impose a suspension without pay under that policy. A player does not have to be charged with or convicted of a crime to be punished under the policy if the league believes after an investigation that discipline is warranted. The league also can place a player on paid leave on the commissioner\u2019s exempt list during the legal proceedings.\n\nThe Patriots officially announced their signing of Brown on Tuesday. He agreed to a one-year contract, worth as much as $15 million, on Saturday, hours after being released by the Oakland Raiders after a short but tumultuous stay with the team that ended when he requested his release via social media.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nRaiders\u2019 Gareon Conley expected to recover after suffering a scary injury in an odd collision\n\nSome Dolphins players reportedly aren\u2019t all that fond of the team\u2019s tanking plans\n\n\u2018Not bad for a running back\u2019: Lamar Jackson answers critics with dominant Week 1", "description": "The New England Patriots wide receiver denied the allegations through his attorney.", "authors": ["Will Hobson", "National Sports Reporter With A Focus On Accountability", "Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl", "September At Pm", "Will Hobson Is A National Sports Reporter For The Washington Post.
