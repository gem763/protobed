One, Sam Gyimah, has since defected to the Liberal Democrats.\n\nThe deciding factor appeared not to have been recent loyalty, given that Harrington was among MPs who had voted against the government\u2019s compressed Commons timetable for its Brexit bill, which stalled the process.\n\nIn contrast, the former justice secretary David Gauke, who supported the programme motion, remains exiled. The Conservative spokesman declined to explain this, saying the decision came after a procedure led by whips.\n\nIt did not mean those still outside the party system could not be readmitted, \u201cbut there is clearly a process\u201d for them to go through, he added.\n\nAsked if the restoration of the whip was conditional on future loyalty on Brexit, the spokesman said: \u201cThe expectation of all Tory MPs and candidates who are standing for election is that when we come back we will get this deal passed.\u201d\n\nThe expulsion of the 21 Tory rebels not only lost Johnson his working majority but caused significant disquiet among many other MPs, who feared it meant the Conservatives were being reshaped as a less centrist force.\n\nSpeaking earlier on Tuesday, the former chancellor Philip Hammond \u2013 among those still without the whip \u2013 said he feared Johnson wanted to use an election to remove MPs such as him from the Commons.\n\nMichel Barnier tells UK: ignore EU regulatory standards at your peril Read more\n\nHe told the BBC: \u201cI fear that the real narrative here is that the Vote Leave activists \u2013 the cohort that has seized control in Downing Street and to some extent in the headquarters of the Conservative party \u2013 want this general election to change the shape of the Conservative party in parliament. To get rid of a cohort of MPs it regards as not robust enough on this issue and then replace them with hardliners.\n\n\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t matter how many times my party kicks me, abuses me, reviles me, they are not going to stop me feeling like a Conservative. And I am not ready yet to give up fighting for the soul of the Conservative party.\u201d\n\nThe Conservative spokesman said Johnson had sought to reassure those restored to the whip: \u201cThe PM made it very clear to them that he is a one-nation Conservative and it is important the party moves forward.\u201d\n\nThe MPs still without the whip are Gauke, Hammond, Guto Bebb, Kenneth Clarke, Justine Greening, Dominic Grieve, Oliver Letwin, Anne Milton, Antoinette Sandbach and Rory Stewart.\n\nSeparately, the former work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, resigned from both the government and Tory party in protest at Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plans. She has not had the whip restored even though she, like Gauke, supported the withdrawal bill timetable.\n\nSeveral of the still-whipless MPs say they do not plan to stand again in the election, including Clarke, who will step down after just short of 50 years in the Commons, and Stewart, who has launched a bid to become mayor of London as an independent.\n\nThe future of others is less certain. Sandbach faces deselection after Tory party members in her Eddisbury constituency in Cheshire passed a vote of no confidence in her earlier this month.\n\nIt is not clear whether Gauke will be able to stand again as a Tory, while Philip Hammond has said he could stand as an independent in his Runnymede and Weybridge constituency.", "description": "Rebels now free to seek re-election as Conservatives \u2013 but four of those reinstated set to stand down", "authors": ["Peter Walker", "Polly Toynbee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/116d99dd239854eb7ab0b8a44db4e560dda8bb1e/2028_1060_2076_1246/master/2076.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3b471398bb6b0a5b59150264ba9027ee", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
