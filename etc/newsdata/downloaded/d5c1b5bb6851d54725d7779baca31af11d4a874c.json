Then the model is introduced to never-before-seen samples in order to translate an input image from the training set into one that resembles images in this new class.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that NVIDIA has previously made use of GANs to generate hyper-realistic human faces, turn cats to tigers, and even transform MS Paint-style doodles into photorealistic pieces of art.\n\nThe silicon giant plans to report the results of the work at the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) in Seoul this week.\n\nRead next: Moonday Morning: China goes crazy over blockchain", "description": "NVIDIA has created a new AI model \u2014 dubbed \"FUNIT\" \u2014 that can take in a picture of an animal and recreate its facial expression and pose on the face of any other creature.", "authors": ["Ravie Lakshmanan"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fnvidia-gan-hed.png&signature=674fe3f80c93251e5edf75a05463fbab", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
