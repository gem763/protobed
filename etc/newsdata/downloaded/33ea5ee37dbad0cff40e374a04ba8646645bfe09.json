Even the establishment media are getting fed up with her evasive answers.\n\nWarren wants you to think she will only raise taxes on \u201cthe wealthy.\u201d But her \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d plan would impose massive tax increases on the middle class.\n\nWhen questioned by the press as to whether her plan will involve higher middle-class taxes, Warren continues to bob and weave and dodge the question.\n\nSTUDY: EXORBITANT TAXES ON RICH AND CORPORATIONS WOULD COVER LESS THAN HALF OF 'MEDICARE FOR ALL'S' COSTS\n\nIn advance of the last debate by Democratic presidential candidates, Americans for Tax Reform released a video compilation of Warren\u2019s middle-class tax dodges. It shows Warren dodging the question on at least 17 different occasions, all around the country. During the after the debate, she dodged the question another eight times.\n\nBig media names on the left are growing exasperated as Warren refuses to level with them.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you want to answer the question?\u201d said MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews after trying to get an answer out of her on seven times in a row. Finally, he threw in the towel and said: \u201cI\u2019m not getting anywhere.\u201d\n\nDuring an interview with Stephen Colbert, Warren was asked: \u201cHow are you going to pay for it? Are you going to raise the middle-class taxes?\"\n\nAs Warren ramped up her usual long-winded dodge, Colbert cut her off and said: \u201cI've listened to these answers a few times before, and I just want to make a parallel suggestion for you about how you might defend the taxes that perhaps you're not mentioning.\"\n\nEven Warren\u2019s Democratic primary opponents are finally calling her out. The day after the last debate, former Vice President Joe Biden said her evasiveness is raising questions about \u201cwhether or not she\u2019s going to be candid and honest with the American people.\u201d\n\nWarren fashions herself a serious policy person who will level with the American people. But she\u2019s just another tax-and-spend liberal who has a problem telling the truth.\n\nAs it turns out, Americans know they already pay enough in taxes. They also know the games Democrats play with tax rhetoric: A promise during the campaign to only raise taxes on a tiny part of the very wealthiest Scrooge McDucks.\n\nBut once in office, the Democratic politicians \u201cdiscover\u201d by golly that they, in fact, will be imposing tax increases on nearly everyone.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWarren has extraordinarily expensive big plans, funded courtesy of your wallet. Her plans will intrude into every aspect of American life.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder Warren has already endorsed a long list of tax increases including a carbon dioxide tax \u2013 a new national energy tax that will drastically increase costs for Americans.\n\nA carbon tax is so toxic with voters that even the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign purposefully steered clear of it. Her campaign wrote an internal memo noting that a carbon tax would \u201cdisproportionately impact low-income households.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWarren has also endorsed a 30 percent national gun tax, making it more expensive for households to protect themselves. Her gun tax plan has a deliberate goal of reducing gun ownership in the United States \u2013 an attempt to tax the Second Amendment out of existence.\n\nWarren seems to have a problem telling the truth about her policies. But if she gets the Democratic nomination, there will be a historic contrast on taxes. Warren wants to raise your taxes. President Trump wants to cut taxes. Voters won\u2019t be fooled.", "description": "Elizabeth Warren fashions herself a serious policy person who will level with the American people.
