By contrast, 57 per cent said no. That is a 20-point gap.\n\nYes, the polling was done a few days before Ms Pelosi, the Democratic House Speaker, pulled the trigger on impeachment proceedings on Tuesday. But it is consistent with most past polls.\n\nUp until this week the country, despite everything Mr Trump has been through \u2013 most notably the Russian election meddling investigation \u2013 has been against impeachment.\n\nIt is something of which Ms Pelosi has been all too aware. Throughout this year she has repeatedly cautioned against the move, saying public support is not there and it could inadvertently help Mr Trump, letting him play the victim.\n\nSo what changed? Firstly, the Ukrainian scandal arrived. Democrats believe that Mr Trump\u2019s attempt to get a foreign leader to investigate his main political rival at the next election \u2013 Joe Biden \u2013 is clear and simple enough to have cut-through with voters.\n\nSecondly, Ms Pelosi\u2019s caucus shifted. For months now the majority of the 235 Democrats in the House have backed impeachment. But this week the figure started shooting up. By Tuesday around 160 of the 235 backed the move, including many moderates. Ms Pelosi risked a backlash if she did not act.\n\nAnd yet the reasons why Ms Pelosi has been so hesitant to push for impeachment in the first place remain.\n\nShe has repeatedly argued that the Democrats will defeat Mr Trump next year by focusing on policies like healthcare, widely credited with winning the party the House majority in 2018.\n\nYet she has now set Washington on a path that will ensure Mr Trump\u2019s behaviour in office \u2013 and whether it is worthy of a president \u2013 remains front and centre for much of the run-up to the November 2020 vote.\n\nIn the past, Ms Pelosi has insisted that impeachment must be done on a bipartisan basis to succeed. After all not just the House, which the Democrats hold, but the US Senate, which is controlled by the Republicans, need to vote for impeachment for it to be binding.\n\nThere has been no President in the history of our Country who has been treated so badly as I have. The Democrats are frozen with hatred and fear. They get nothing done. This should never be allowed to happen to another President. Witch Hunt! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 25, 2019\n\nBut there is little evidence of that so far. On Wednesday Republican congressmen \u2013 or at least those who did not evade the cameras \u2013 defended Mr Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president. They will have known their voters remain full square behind the president.\n\nMs Pelosi\u2019s great gamble is that this time it is different, that the Ukraine scandal will finally convince Americans impeachment is necessary. Given the president\u2019s success at playing the \u201cwitchhunt\" card to date, however, that is no sure thing.", "description": "If you wanted evidence of just how huge a political gamble Nancy Pelosi has taken by launching impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump it could be found on Wednesday.
