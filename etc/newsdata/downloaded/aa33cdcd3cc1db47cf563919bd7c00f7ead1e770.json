On Sept. 5, they received an email response from an on-site wedding coordinator that said the winery\u2019s owners, Larry and Teri Lawrence, had never hosted a same-sex wedding on their property before.\n\nThe Lawrences \u201chave very strong personal religious beliefs regarding marriage, which is for marriage to be between heterosexual couples only,\u201d the email added. As such, Biddle and Reyes would be permitted to hire the venue for their reception, but not their ceremony.\n\n\u201cI understand and am not opposed to people having their own personal religious beliefs [but] I just fell shunned by people who do not know me,\u201d Reyes wrote on Facebook, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. \u201cI will still have a beautiful wedding when my time comes. I just want others to be aware of this venue ... so our LGBTQ community knows about this venue so when they do start looking [for wedding venues], they can be aware.\u201d\n\nThe news soon caught the eye of Nikki Levy, a Los Angeles film executive best known for the live comedy series and podcast \u201cDon\u2019t Tell My Mother!\u201d\n\nLevy, who identifies as a lesbian and recently got married herself, reached out to Viaggio Estate & Winery \u2015 and got a very similar response.\n\nOn Tuesday, she shared screenshots of the exchange on Facebook.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that this would happen in California, and I couldn\u2019t believe that someone would be so openly homophobic,\u201d Levy told local NBC affiliate KCRA. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like gay people, and you don\u2019t believe because of your religious beliefs that they should be married, don\u2019t go and have a place that holds weddings.\u201d\n\nBy Wednesday, Teri Lawrence announced that the winery would no longer object to same-sex weddings, and said she was \u201csincerely sorry to have caused anyone pain at a time that should be joyous.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn recent communications with potential visitors, I tried to explore options for celebrations that would accommodate both my religious beliefs and the expectations of our community,\u201d she said in a prepared statement. \u201cI realize now that contrary to my intent, this was hurtful to the people involved.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur staff, our customers and our community have helped me see that I was wrong,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cOur policy has been changed, effective immediately.\u201d\n\nThough Reyes plans to host her wedding elsewhere, she nonetheless said she wishes \u201cthe best\u201d for Viaggio, and is hopeful the debacle \u201copens their eyes that they should be open to other people.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, love is love,\u201d she told KCRA.", "description": "Viaggio Estate & Winery\u2019s owners said their policy has changed after receiving backlash.
