Thirty years later, it is still 81% \u2014 despite the incredible increase in wind and solar energy, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nFossil fuels\u2019 staying power\n\nGlobal fossil-fuel companies have built powerful political operations to lobby governments to maintain subsidies and oppose big climate policy.\n\nThis is starting to change among some oil companies, but it\u2019s an uneven shift, and it's not (yet) fundamentally changing the system they helped build.\n\nBut a lot more is driving fossil fuels\u2019 dominance than just corporate influence on government. Oil, natural gas and coal provide immense benefits to society \u2014 even though they also have immense environmental costs.\n\nThe chemical makeup of the fuels make them especially good at a lot of things, including industrial processes like making plastics. Renewables or other resources cannot easily replace that (even though big brands, like Legos, are trying).\n\n\"Some sectors, such as transportation and petrochemicals [plastics], almost completely rely on one single fuel, in this case oil,\u201d said Fatih Birol, IEA executive director. Nonetheless, Birol said fossil-fuel consumption subsidies that totaled $400 billion in 2018 are providing an \u201cunfair advantage\u201d to those fuels.\n\nOur dependence on fossil fuels is often likened to that of cigarette smoking, but the analogy doesn\u2019t hold up.\n\nSmoking is an unhealthy habit some people choose to engage in, and if they choose, they can try to kick that addiction without changing their life.\n\nFossil fuels are the foundation of our global economy, and it\u2019s nearly impossible to go about our lives without using them in some form.\n\nMore addition, less transition\n\nIn the world of energy and climate change, people talk about the \u201cenergy transition,\u201d the concept that we are moving from fossil fuels to renewable energy. But for now and the next few decades, it\u2019s more of an energy addition.\n\nRenewable electricity (which is the primary use for wind and solar) is often being added on top of instead of in lieu of fossil fuels, particularly in Asia\u2019s rapidly growing economies.\n\nOur energy system, particularly electricity, is built on multi-billion dollar infrastructure investments designed to last decades. Replacing them is like changing direction on a jetliner, not a jet ski.\n\nBecause of this dynamic and because our global energy demand keeps rising, our emissions keep growing despite the skyrocketing use of wind and solar energy.\n\nFlashback: History shows that energy transitions take many decades and overlap, as Reuters analyst John Kemp wrote in a must-read column late last year.\n\n\u201cThe United States was still using more fuel wood in the 1910s than it had in the 1840s \u2014 even though wood had been clearly overtaken by coal and to a lesser extent petroleum as an energy source.\u201d\n\nConsumer demand vs. expectation\n\nMore people around the world say they\u2019re worried about climate change \u2014 but that concern is not translating into a willingness to pay more for energy or vote for candidates who support aggressive action.\n\nWe saw that happen in this spring\u2019s Australian national elections, French protests over gasoline taxes and a Washington state carbon tax ballot initiative failure in 2018, as I detailed in this story from May.\n\nOne notable exception: Europe\u2019s parliamentary elections this spring saw elections of pro-environmental candidates.\n\nA common theme in these examples is how passively we consume energy. That sets this sector apart from others and makes change more elusive because the connection with consumers is less acute.\n\nUnlike, say, Apple and Coca Cola, most energy companies are selling products we engage with passively. We expect the pumps at the gas station to pump gasoline and the lights to come on when we flip the switch, but we don\u2019t actually think about it (unless the lights don\u2019t come on or if there\u2019s no gas pumping).\n\nand the lights to come on when we flip the switch, but we don\u2019t actually think about it (unless the lights don\u2019t come on or if there\u2019s no gas pumping). On the other hand, we think a lot about how we engage with our phones and whether to drink a Diet Coke or sparkling water.\n\nWhat\u2019s (maybe) next: If a Democrat wins the White House in 2020, America will likely be a political and technical test case for policies drastically and swiftly reducing our deep fossil-fuel dependence. That's because most of the Democratic candidates are calling for such a move, with Sen. Bernie Sanders proposing the most aggressive plan just last week.\n\nGo deeper: Why climate change is so hard to tackle: the global problem", "description": "Our dependence on fossil fuels has remained about the same for 30 years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/MkXJtCZj3C0zTug-jqg0TrcYYNM=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/08/23/1566577019678.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-26"}
