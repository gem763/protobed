Beto O\u2019Rourke is releasing a blueprint for criminal justice reform that focuses on eliminating mass incarceration and providing rehabilitation of inmates to prevent recidivism, according to a copy of the plan provided to Yahoo News.\n\n\u201cWe must connect the dots between mass incarceration and the racism in this country that fueled its rise,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said in a statement to Yahoo News. \u201cWe may never be able to undo the damage of this tragic era \u2014 in which millions of our fellow Americans have been locked up in the system and locked out of opportunity in our country \u2014 but we must do everything we can to begin to make it right. That means ending mass incarceration, investing in rehabilitation, and ensuring the formerly incarcerated have the support, protections and opportunities they need to thrive when they re-enter our communities.\"\n\nIn O\u2019Rourke\u2019s plan, which is set to be publicly released Monday morning, he pledges to invest $500 million to developing a \u201cpilot program\u201d focused on coming up with \u201calternatives to incarceration,\u201d though it does not specify what some of those alternatives might be.\n\nFor those inside the federal prison system, a shortened sentence could become a reality under an O\u2019Rourke administration. According to the document, he hopes to grant clemency to 25,000 inmates in his first term, which would reportedly save the federal government \u201chundreds of millions of dollars.\u201d\n\nThe yearly cost to confine an inmate in 2016 was $36,299.25, according to the federal bureau of prisons, and if those figures remained constant through 2021, the potential annual savings would come to more than $900 million.\n\nStill, such sweeping ambitions for overhauling the criminal justice system would need to be carried out at the state levels as well. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s plan banks on cooperation from governors to \u201cadopt aggressive goals\u201d to provide clemency to individuals in their home states. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s administration would also triple the budget for re-entry grants to states \u2014 designed to help individuals once released from prison \u2014 to $3 billion over ten years.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s plan targets treatment of inmates during their imprisonment as well. The Texas legislator promises to totally eliminate fees for phone calls of incarcerated individuals \u2014 which can amount to $20 for a 15-minute conversation.\n\nHe would also establish a new office within the Department of Justice called the \u201cOffice of Disability,\u201d which would be focused on treating mental health. Law enforcement, first responders and civilian staff would receive mental health treatment, too, through expanded peer-to-peer support groups.\n\nThe broad strokes of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s plans are largely popular across Democratic party contenders; in fact, many candidates have pushed for the overhaul of the criminal justice system. Nearly every candidate \u2014 even the more centrist ones \u2014 share similar views on abolishing capital punishment, ending cash bail and eliminating mandatory minimum sentencing, according to a Politico tracker.\n\nWhat distinguishes O\u2019Rourke\u2019s vision is his plan to \u201cguarantee full enfranchisement\u201d to four and a half million formerly incarcerated individuals by ensuring that they have the right to vote and access to post-incarceration housing and employment.\n\nThe campaign\u2019s rollout of its criminal justice policies comes on the footsteps of Second Step Presidential Justice Forum, held Friday in Columbia, S.C., where President Trump received the Bipartisan Justice Award for his work in passing the First Step Act, legislation supported by both parties. Among other goals, the act works toward the reintroduction of former inmates into society. Such legislation was advocated by untraditional surrogates like reality star Kim Kardashian West, who is married to rapper Kanye West, an outspoken Trump supporter.\n\nThough several Democratic candidates were present at the forum, O\u2019Rourke was campaigning in Iowa.\n\nWhile this is the campaign\u2019s first official blueprint for criminal justice reform, O\u2019Rourke has voiced concerns about the country\u2019s prison system and policing over the past several years. He was one of many authors on a bipartisan Brennan Center memo pushing for changes in America\u2019s incarceration system.\n\nIn his section of the report, he called for ending the \u201cfailing war on drugs\u201d and advocated for many of the reforms now included in his campaign plan, such as scrapping mandatory minimum sentencing for non-violent drug offenders and eradicating for-profit prisons, which he described as one practice that \u201cprofits off human suffering.\u201d", "description": "Former Texas Rep.
