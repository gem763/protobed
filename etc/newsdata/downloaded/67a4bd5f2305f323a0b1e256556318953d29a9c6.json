It is the first year this has happened and it will not happen again.\u2019\n\nThis seemed reasonable, as Jacklin was right that a number of qualified players had not turned up for the event, including seeds Nick Kenny and Wayne Warren.\n\nHowever, the non-registered players didn\u2019t equal the non-arrivals so it wasn\u2019t as simple as the original plan, then came the mystery of the fake players in the draw.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor reasons this observer does not fully understand, non-existent players were put in the draw, apparently so they could be replaced with real players if too many turned up.\n\nWhat would have happened if someone would have had to take on a man who doesn\u2019t exist is not clear.\n\nThis never came to pass, though, because the draw, which was made on Tuesday was scrapped and a redraw commenced at the venue.\n\nDue to several internationally-based players having travelled without correctly entering this year's World Masters, there has been a redraw.

I can barely hear. Also\u2026there are no chalkers allocated for any boards so I suspect a further delay incoming. #WorldMasters pic.twitter.com/krbUyjP69f \u2014 The Darting Nerd (@thedartingnerd) October 23, 2019\n\nThere was further mystery earlier in the day when a contract was produced for players to sign, which materialised on Twitter from Live Darts\u2019 content machine Phill Barrs.\n\nIf signed, the contract stated that playing in the World Masters or BDO World Championship qualifiers would mean players could not play in the PDC World Championship or qualifiers in December.\n\nIf players went on to play in the PDC event, their prize money from the World Masters would not be paid, or if it had been paid, would be owed back to the BDO.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t apply to many players, but some it would very much impact, with American Danny Baggish and Slovenia\u2019s Benjamin Pratnemer who have already qualified for the PDC World Championship and were also in the World Masters, in Grays, ready to play.\n\nBaggish did not sign the contract and played anyway, losing to Gary Stone in the last 64. It is unconfirmed whether the Slovenian signed the contract, but he is into the last 32 and playing Carl Hamilton at the Circus Tavern on Friday.\n\nThe contract handed to players at the World Masters (Picture: Twitter/Phill Barrs)\n\nAnother major issue is that the prize fund for the tournament was still not confirmed on the morning the event got underway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is now believed to have stayed at the same level as last season (\u00a360,000) but that has not been officially announced, and players were understandably unsettled to be arriving at a competition without knowing what they were playing for.\n\nA competitor was told on Wednesday: \u2018We\u2019ll tell you if you get to the last 32, if you don\u2019t make that, you don\u2019t need to know.\u2019\n\nThere were also minor bones of contention, which would have seemed minimal on other days, but surrounded by other bizarre events, they just added to the chaos.\n\nBrian Cathcart, a player from Northern Ireland, was named on the draw sheet at the end of the day, apparently coming through three rounds to book his spot in the last 32.\n\nCathcart had never been at the venue. This was a simple error on the sheet, and it was Pratnemer who had come through that section of the draw, but with the confusion swirling, it would have been almost no surprise to see the no-show still succeed.\n\nWhen the darts actually started and the tournament was played down to 32 players, it largely went without much fuss and we have our last 32, who will compete at the legendary Circus Tavern on Eurosport on Friday.\n\nThat 32 will not include the likes of Wesley Harms, Jim Williams, Martin Adams and Andy Hamilton, though, who all fell early on Wednesday. The top 16 seeds all had to begin at the very first stage, which was another kick in the teeth for them, and does hurt the star power of the televised stages.\n\nAll fans, players and organisers alike will be hoping the rest of the tournament goes much more smoothly and the chaos of Grays will be forgotten, but it all just seemed a great shame for those who had worked so hard to qualify, and some who had travelled so far to be there.\n\nThe Weekly Dartscast\u2019s Matthew Kiernan said: \u2018It\u2019s a big deal \u2013 21 people were there from Northern Ireland, three or four of them got to the last 32 which is great, but it\u2019s the pinnacle of their season. They were all really sad and furious at the redraw, they are the ones shouting in the video.\n\n\u2018There was a big group from America, one of them, Timmy Nicoll, had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer four months ago, because of the diagnosis he decided to go to the event and took his son who qualified for the youth as well, and they\u2019re treated like that. It was tough and heartbreaking.\u2019\n\nMORE: BDO confirm 2019 Grand Slam of Darts representatives as Mikuru Suzuki and Lisa Ashton make debuts\n\nMORE: Bobby George questions BDO World Championship leaving Lakeside: \u2018It could be a washout\u2019", "description": "The British Darts Organisation (BDO) is going through a turbulent time and the opening day of the World Masters seemed to optimise the chaos and confusion that is damaging the...", "authors": ["Phil Haigh"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-51905414_1571935255.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
