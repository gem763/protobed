On Monday, Hampton tweeted a request for political candidates who would be interested in testing the rules. \u201cDon\u2019t make me run for governor or something,\u201d he said. \u201cMy wife will not be thrilled.\u201d\n\nTwo hours later, he announced he would be running as an independent candidate in the 2022 California gubernatorial race on a platform of social media regulation.\n\nHampton has been clear about his intention to run adverts, tweeting a call for volunteers to \u201cignore Facebook\u2019s fact-checking rules and just do viral ad-driven dunks all day\u201d.\n\nHe has run for office once before, in California\u2019s 10th congressional district, and he said observers should not count him out of the race in three years\u2019 time.\n\nFacebook had previously told reporters, including Buzzfeed\u2019s Ryan Broderick, that the only reason it would block a candidate from running false ads would be if the person had already been banned from the platform when they registered.\n\nRyan Broderick (@broderick) Absolutely. I asked FB about this exact thing happening \u2014 someone registering as a candidate to run ads \u2014 and they said the only thing that would block it is if the person had previously been banned, like Alex Jones running for mayor or something.\n\nMark Zuckerberg has defended his company\u2019s decision to exempt politicians from fact-checking, saying it is not the place of technology companies to become arbiters of truth.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think most people want to live in a world where you can only post things that tech companies judge to be 100% true,\u201d Zuckerberg said this month.", "description": "Adriel Hampton registered as candidate for California governor in attempt to avoid checks", "authors": ["Alex Hern"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bac1160a6b4a0dee30095183a60aae1ea1f0dd1d/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0075f137e634e787e83dbe94027fcc10", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
