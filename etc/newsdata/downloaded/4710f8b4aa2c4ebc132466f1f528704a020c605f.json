Everyone agreed with the judges in their criticism of the \u201ccrime scene\u201d tiling at the bottom of the stairs, and Jesse and Mel take the piss out of the under-the-stairs wine cellar.\n\nTess, meanwhile, can\u2019t work out why Mark and Mitch\u2019s bedroom styling was described as suitable for Kate Moss.\n\n\u201cAre her shoes filthy Grey Street hooker shoes?\u201d she asks. Not nice, Tess.\n\nAnd absolutely everyone agrees Jesse and Mel should have won, most of all, Jesse and Mel.\n\nAs the teams decide on which of their rooms to redo, Keith and Dan are out and about with those blue stickers, noting defects for the teams to fix. They find 50 on Mark and Mitch\u2019s ground floor alone. It\u2019s stressful just looking at them.\n\nTess and Luke have decided to redo their kitchen and dining room. They\u2019re removing that fixed dining table jutting off the island bench, and are turning their formal lounge into a dining room instead, with a 250kg concrete table.\n\nMatt and El\u2019ise are also redoing their kitchen. After being disgusted with the judges\u2019 criticism of her layout, she\u2019s now come around to their way of thinking and after having lived with the kitchen agrees there\u2019s nowhere near enough benchspace.\n\nThey\u2019re getting rid of the obtrusive rangehood that sits like a monolith from 2001 A Space Odyssey in the middle of the kitchen and dining room, and moving the oven and coffee machine to free up some benchspace.\n\nElsewhere, Deb has reported her Block car stolen. She\u2019s barefoot \u2014 can we pause for a moment and ask ourselves who goes shopping without shoes? \u2014 and wandering around Port Melbourne looking for it. When the local cops take time out of their busy schedules to investigate, promptly finding it around the corner, she sticks to her story that a thief took it, only to move it around the corner, citing as evidence the fact the driver\u2019s seat was pushed way back.\n\nThe footage shows the seat was pushed back by Deb, who parked it around the corner and not where she swore blind she parked it.\n\n\u201cI have Block brain,\u201d she says. Either that or concussion.\n\nBut really, the big news on this episode isn\u2019t an unstolen car, it\u2019s the fact that Block budgeting goodie-two shoes Mark and Mitch have run out of money. And not only run out, are in the red.\n\nThey get two big bills that are much higher than expected, and Mitch is soon muttering about Mark not being a good negotiator. It begins to dawn on the pair that they might be the only team on The Block paying full whack to their tradies. That added to fact they\u2019ve employed a cast of thousands on their jobs means they have to send them all home.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been happy to pay the going rate\u2026 but these couple of bills came in big so we can\u2019t have working because we can\u2019t pay you,\u201d Mark tells them.\n\nAsked what the other teams will make of the development and Mark is spot on.\n\n\u201cI think people will be surprised, shocked, and excited and happy.\u201d\n\nCue footage of the other contestants laughing uproariously.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve definitely isolated themselves in the last month. Do we not help them or do we show that we\u2019re good people and help them,\u201d El\u2019ise muses.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear what Luke and Tess\u2019 attitude will be.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to celebrate tonight because we are no longer the poor ones,\u201d he says.\n\nMISSED AN EPISODE?\n\n\n\nEP 49 recap: Block room \u2018looks like a public toilet\u2019\n\nEP 47/48 recap: Tess and Luke\u2019s marriage fears\n\n\n\nEP 46: Mitch and Jesse go head to head\n\n\n\nEP 45 recap: Judges slam pathetic balcony\n\n\n\n\n\nEP 43/44 recap: Has Mel had enough of her \u2018worst boyfriend\u2019\n\nEP 42 recap: Scott Cam blows his stack at contestant\n\n\n\nEP 41 recap: Room brings Shaynna Blaze to tears\n\n\n\nEP 39/40 recap: Tess and Luke finally run out of cash\n\n\n\nEP 38 recap: Mark and Mitch blow their stacks\n\nEP 37 recap: Will Tess and Luke walk out?\n\n\n\nEP 35 and 36 recap: Reason for Tess and Luke\u2019s devastation\n\nEP 34 recap: Mitch puts his foot through the ceiling\n\nEP 32 recap: producer dragged into cheating scandal\n\n\n\nEP 30 recap: \u2018Dog\u2019s breakfast\u2019: kitchen savagely mocked\n\nEP 29 recap: Scott Cam gives contestants a serve\n\nEP 27/28 recap: Gloves are off as teams threaten to quit\n\nEP 26 recap: Tess and Luke flush another tradie\n\nEP 25 recap: Is this the best bathroom on the Block ever?\n\nEP 24 recap: Is this the best Block bathroom ever?\n\nEP 23 recap: \u2018I\u2019m so sorry\u201d \u2014 Mark and Mitch patch things up with Scott\n\n\n\nEP 22 recap: What made Scott Cam storm off?\n\nEP 21 recap: Homophobia row rocks The Block\n\n\n\nEP 19/ 20 recap: \u2018you just told me my baby is ugly\u2019\n\nEP 18 recap: Tess\u2019 expletive-filled tirade after tradie sacking\n\nEP 17 recap: Loo controversy sinks two teams\n\nEP 15/16 recap: What made Mitch snap?\n\nEP 14 recap: Jesse and Keith\u2019s blow up\n\nEP 13 recap: Judges slam Mark and Mitch\n\nEP 11/12: Big move may blow up friendship\n\nEP 10 recap: Why Scott Cam locked a contestant in car\n\nEP 9 recap: How Jesse insulted Shaynna\n\nEP 7/8: \u2018Don\u2019t be nice to them\u2019.
