Instead, the filing only uses the initials for their full names, S.L.P. and T.M.P., according to the Anchorage Daily News.\n\nBut the filing reportedly includes the date that the couple got married and the birth date of their 11-year-old son Trig. It asks for joint custody of the boy. The other Palin children \u2014 Bristol, Piper, Track and Willow \u2014 are all adults.\n\nThe news was first reported by Craig Medred, an independent journalist in Alaska. Representatives for Palin and an attorney representing her husband did not immediately return messages from CBS News.\n\nTodd Palin called himself the \"first dude\" of Alaska when his wife served as governor from 2006 until she resigned in 2009. She shot to national fame in 2008 after Republican presidential candidate John McCain chose her as his running mate.\n\nThe couple had been together for 31 years.", "description": "Court documents say the couple's \"incompatibility\" makes it \"impossible to live together as husband and wife\"", "authors": ["Jason Silverstein"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/03/15/a0af6630-cf70-4218-bb22-6117edecd229/thumbnail/1200x630/4b63537b4cc85764e6bb36d74dafbd5d/sarah-palin-todd-palin.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
