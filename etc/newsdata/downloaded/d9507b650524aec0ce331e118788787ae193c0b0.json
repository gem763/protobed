Afternoon temperatures mainly reached the 80s, which is still well above normal for the date. A weak cold front passes tonight, but it\u2019ll stay warm and humid into Sunday.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough Tonight: We run the risk of a few showers or storms into the evening and through about midnight, but most spots should stay dry. Otherwise, partly cloudy conditions rule. Lows are mainly in the upper 60s to lower 70s. Winds turn to come from the north around 5 mph late.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Sunday): Behind a weak front, we\u2019re looking at a more pleasant day than today. That said, humidity is still on the moderate to high side so it won\u2019t exactly be comfortable. Highs range from near 80 to the mid-80s. Winds are out of the northeast around 5 mph.\n\nSee my forecast through the beginning of next week. And if you haven\u2019t already, join us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter and Instagram.
