Myers has already served over a decade of his 65-year prison sentence.\n\nIn 2006, Myers was convicted in state court in the murder of Indiana University freshman Jill Behrman, who went missing before she was scheduled to arrive at work. While the bike she was riding was found days later, her remains were not discovered until 2003 after hunters found them in a wooded area in a nearby county.\n\nAccording to the Indianapolis Star, investigators believed that Myers killed Behrman, a stranger to him, because he was upset his girlfriend at the time had broken up with him.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

He then went to federal court and sought a writ of habeas corpus\u2014arguing that his lawyers provided ineffective defense during the trial, and that prosecutors presented false evidence and withheld exculpatory evidence.\n\nIn a 147-page order released on Monday, Sweeney determined that Myers\u2019 counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness violated his Sixth Amendment right, which guarantees all accused the right \u201cto a speedy and public trial\u2026and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.\u201d\n\nMyers had been represented at trial by lead attorney Patrick V. Baker, as well as Hugh Baker.\n\nAccording to Sweeney, Myers\u2019 lawyers made two false statements to the jury in their opening statements, failed to object to inadmissible bloodhound evidence and failed to object to evidence Behrman was raped before she was murdered.\n\n\u201cMr. Myers\u2019s counsel made false statements to the jury during opening arguments,\u201d Sweeney wrote, \u201cwhich the counsel admitted to the Indiana Supreme Court in a subsequent attorney disciplinary proceeding. (They) also failed to object to two significant categories of evidence that should not have been presented to the jury.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the end, these serious errors all but destroyed the defense that trial counsel presented to the jury and tainted the entire trial,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to the Indiana Supreme Court, the false statements included the claim that search dogs were sent out shortly after the victim\u2019s disappearance, and while one dog was \u201calerted\u201d at the home of Behrman\u2019s married co-worker, Mr. Hollars, the dog was called off. \u201cThese statements were false and Respondent should have known that no evidence would be admitted at trial to support them,\u201d the Indiana Supreme Court said.\n\nThe lawyers also falsely claimed that Hollars and Behrman were seen arguing days before she disappeared. According to Sweeney, one of Myers\u2019 attorneys\u2019 theories presented to the jury was that Behrman was having an affair with Hollars, got pregnant and Hollars killed her to \u201ccover it up.\u201d\n\nAccording to Sweeney, \u201cthe cumulative prejudice flowing from these errors is sufficient to entitle Mr. Myers to relief.\u201d\n\nDespite being suspended for practicing law for at least six months in 2011 for his false statements in his opening arguments in the Myers\u2019 case, lead trial attorney Patrick Baker tells TIME in a statement that he is \u201cvery pleased\u201d with the ruling.\n\n\u201cOur legal team initially took on Mr. Myers\u2019 murder case in April of 2006 pro bono because we believed in his innocence, as we still do,\u201d Baker said. \u201cWe fight for the Constitutional rights of our clients, and when necessary, take on difficult and unpopular causes in the interest of justice. We are very pleased the Court\u2019s Order has given John Myers and his family renewed hope. We express our heartfelt sympathies to the Behrman family and will continue to pray for all involved.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to TIME, Jill\u2019s mother, Marilyn Behrman, says she is \u201cdisappointed in this ruling, especially after so many years.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do trust the justice system and the process, so I will take this one day and one moment at a time and will deal with it,\u201d she added. \u201cI am more concerned with the emotional toll this may take on family and friends. I believe I am stronger now than I was the first time around and I know Jill would be proud of me for that.\u201d\n\nHugh Baker and a third lawyer, Mike Keifer, who only entered an appearance in order to read the grand jury transcripts, did not immediately respond to TIME\u2019s request for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, the Office of the Indiana Attorney General says in a statement obtained by TIME that \u201cwe respectfully disagree with the federal court\u2019s decision. We believe the Indiana courts handled this case appropriately. We continue to carefully review this ruling and will vigorously pursue justice.\u201d\n\nThe office also said that it will review the case to determine whether or not they will retry Myers.\n\nWhile wrongful convictions are frequently overturned, Molly J. Walker-Wilson, a law professor at Saint Louis University School of Law, tells TIME that it is \u201cvery rare\u201d for murder convictions to be vacated due to ineffective counsel.\n\n\u201cThe burden for defendants seeking to overturn a conviction on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel is substantial,\u201d she says. \u201cStatistically speaking, the vast majority of such attempts fail.\u201d\n\nAnne Geraghty-Rathert, a professor of legal studies at Webster University in St. Louis, tells TIME that she is \u201cvery surprised,\u201d at Sweeney\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the judge granted a writ of habeas corpus based on an ineffective counsel that is almost a non-starter in the United States,\u201d she says. \u201cThe standard for the ineffectiveness of counsel are almost impossible to meet, so even for cases where we have lawyers falling asleep at the counsel table and all these things people challenge that as ineffectiveness of counsel and they never win-so for this decision it must be really egregious.\u201d\n\nAccording to Geraghty-Rathert, most murder convictions are overturned by exculpatory DNA evidence, so Myers\u2019 case is unique.\n\n\u201cThe Sixth Amendment guarantees you an attorney in all criminal matters. However, up to this moment it\u2019s been basically if there is a counsel, an attorney, sitting next to you\u2014that\u2019s almost good enough to count no matter what that person is doing,\u201d she tells TIME. \u201cSo there have been a lot of wrongful conviction cases that have been brought to life by DNA exoneration in the last 10 years, but it\u2019s highly unusual to have an ineffective assistance of counsel case.\u201d\n\nBehrman\u2019s murder was one of the most high-profile murder cases Indiana had seen in years, but the case against Myers was not that straightforward.\n\nAccording to court documents, the case initially had many false leads, including a woman named Wendy Owings who confessed to police in 2002 that she was in a car that struck Behrman. Owing told police that the driver of the car, Uriah Clouse, stabbed Behrman in the chest then wrapped her body in plastic and dumped her in a creek. She later recanted her statement.\n\nWhen Behrman\u2019s body was found, authorities determined her cause of death was a shotgun wound to the back of her head.\n\nMyers drew the attention of investigators in 2001 when he contacted authorities to report finding a bone and women\u2019s underwear near where he had gone fishing.\n\nWhile serving jail time in 2002 for unrelated charges, Myers also told a correctional officer that he found letters in a food tray that contained information regarding Behrman\u2019s disappearance, and then provided authorities with a list of locations where Behrman could be found.\n\nAdditionally, witnesses placed Myers near the area where Behrman went missing, and Myers repeatedly alluded to Behrman\u2019s disappearance to friends, family members, and co-workers, raising their suspicions, investigators said.\n\nMyers is currently incarcerated in Indiana State Prison.\n\nIn his order, Sweeney acknowledged that a possible retrial would be difficult for Behrman\u2019s family.\n\n\u201cA new trial will likely come only at considerable cost \u2014 to the State, yes, but, more important, to the victim\u2019s family and community still wounded by their tragic loss,\u201d the judgment read. \u201cSuch cost do not enter into the constitutional analysis; and yet, the Court cannot help but express its empathy for those who must bear them for the sake of our Constitutions and its protections.\u201d\n\nWrite to Gina Martinez at gina.martinez@time.com.", "description": "A judge ordered John Myers II, who was convicted of murdering Indiana University freshman Jill Behrman in 2000, to be released from prison.", "authors": ["Gina Martinez"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/jill-behrman-murder.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C0px%2C2400px%2C1256px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
