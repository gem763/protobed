He faces the hulking Swiss, against whom he played in the French Open semi-final of that year, the last big match before his serious hip problems became apparent.\n\n'I feel good,' insisted Murray, who has complained of a sore elbow this week. 'It has been a long road to get back to this point. I didn't expect it to come so soon, it has been a big surprise to me. Stan is a brilliant player, we've played against each other in some big matches, he has had his share of injury problems as well.'\n\nThe Scot overcame Hembert in three sets after initially struggling to impose his game\n\nWawrinka has suffered with his knees, but is sure to be the fresher of the two men after dismissing the startling teenage Italian talent Jannik Sinner in straight sets earlier in the day.\n\nWhatever happens, just getting to the final has been a remarkable effort, having arrived in Belgium after three weeks in China, aware all the while that wife Kim is soon to give birth to their third child back home in Surrey.\n\nThis will be his last match before taking a break and preparing for the Davis Cup finals in late November.\n\nHumbert, 21 and regarded as a serious prospect, had dominated the first half of the match with his penetrating lefthanded strokes. The 32 year-old Scot was too passive at times and appeared to be feeling the strain of his recent workload.\n\nMurray emotionally suggested nine months ago that his career might be coming to an end\n\nMurray, sarcastically engaging with his support box, got a break for 3-1 in the second but it was no great surprise when he was immediately broken back. Everything pointed towards the Frenchman claiming a straight sets victory as he continued to punish the twice Wimbledon champion's second serve.\n\nThen out of the blue at 5-6 Humbert began to miss badly, and thanks to a double fault Murray converted the third of his three break points to take it into another decider between two players who had been in action well into the previous evening.\n\nA run of five straight games put him decisively ahead as the younger man's consistency deserted him, and he closed it out comfortably at the end. Wawrinka may be less forgiving, but merely being back in a final is an incredible testament to the resolve of the twice Wimbledon champion.", "description": "Nine months and one hip surgery after those emotional farewells in Australia Andy Murray is back in a final on the ATP Tour.
