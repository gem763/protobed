If you value battery life, you\u2019ll do better with the WQHD or FHD screen options.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nLenovo laptops should certainly rank high up on any laptop shopper\u2019s list, but there\u2019s one line of Lenovo laptops that a lot of people likely overlook, just because they\u2019re \u201cbusiness\u201d laptops.\n\nLenovo ThinkPads are often associated with business uses, and they\u2019re often issued by companies to their employees for that reason: work. But you\u2019d be missing out if you dismissed Lenovo\u2019s ThinkPad X1 Carbon laptops while shopping around for a new laptop.\n\nIndeed, there are some things about the X1 Carbon that are really only useful for businesses, like Intel\u2019s \u201cvPro\u201d technology designed to make life easier for corporate IT teams. That vPro stuff is expensive, but it\u2019s only an option.\n\nYou, me, and anyone else who wants an awesome laptop can get an X1 Carbon that doesn\u2019t come with the business stuff. And they\u2019re priced and spec\u2019d competitively against regular, non-business laptops.\n\nRead more: Samsung and Microsoft are teaming up to take on Apple\u2019s iMessage dominance\n\nLenovo\u2019s X1 Carbon starts at $1,253 for a four-core Intel Core i5, 8 GB of RAM, 256 GB of storage, and a 14-inch FHD 1080p display.\n\nIf you want a Core i7 and 16 GB of RAM, it\u2019ll cost $1,453, which is an incredible price tag for those specs.\n\nEveryone looking for a new laptop should be looking at Lenovo\u2019s seventh-gen ThinkPad X1 Carbon.\n\nCheck out what makes it such an awesome laptop:\n\nWithin seconds of picking up the ThinkPad X1 Carbon, I could tell its stock had already risen beyond other laptops I\u2019d tried.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nThis thing is exceptionally light, at 2.4 pounds \u2013 lighter than a 2.75-pound MacBook Air.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s thinner, at 0.58 inches, than the MacBook Air\u2019s thickest point of 0.61 inches, but it doesn\u2019t taper down as the MacBook Air does, so it\u2019s still thicker overall.\n\nLightness and portability weren\u2019t always priorities for me. But once you try something as light as the X1 Carbon, it can easily flip your priorities.\n\nThe other thing that immediately gave bonus points to the X1 Carbon was the ports.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nYou get one HDMI port, two USB 3.1 ports, two USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports for docks and charging, an odd-looking Ethernet expansion port, and a headphone jack.\n\nIf you still use, or want to use, your USB-A accessories without depending on a USB-C docking station or adapter, the X1 Carbon will make it easier for you than laptops that come with only USB-C ports, like Apple\u2019s laptops and the Dell XPS 13.\n\nWith things like cloud storage and wireless accessories, it\u2019s actually pretty easy to come to terms with a USB-C-only laptop. You might not often need an old-fashioned USB-A port. But for those few times you might need one, the X1 Carbon has your back.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple\u2019s laptops and other Windows 10 laptops that are USB-C-only leave you stranded unless you have an adapter with you.\n\nThe X1 Carbon has a classic, stealth look that leans toward the utilitarian rather than the beautiful \u2014 and I love it.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nThe rubbery plastic exterior and interior feels premium and somewhat unique in a sea of metal-laden laptops. It\u2019s an updated classic IBM/Lenovo design that\u2019s aged extremely well.\n\nOpen the X1 Carbon, and you\u2019re greeted with the signature IBM/Lenovo red-nubbin mouse nestled in the keyboard. I\u2019m sure some people out there still use the nubbin, but for me it\u2019s more of a nostalgic detail. It\u2019s like the BlackBerry keyboard of laptops \u2013 a throwback feature made redundant with newer, better technology. For BlackBerry phones, that tech was the touchscreen; for the IBM/Lenovo nubbin, it\u2019s the touchpad.\n\nThe nubbin never posed any issues, but I wish the three buttons below the keyboard/above the touchpad weren\u2019t there to give more space for the touchpad itself.\n\nLenovo laptops have the best keyboards in the business.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever used an IBM/Lenovo keyboard, you\u2019ll be glad to see the signature keyboard too.\n\nI\u2019m not going to pretend I\u2019ve tried every laptop keyboard in the world, but I\u2019m convinced this is the absolute best keyboard on any laptop. The keys have deep, comfortable travel and supreme responsiveness, and typing is a truly satisfying joy on this thing.\n\nThe Carbon X1 works as well as other laptops with similar specs, and it\u2019s incredibly quiet too.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nI\u2019ve been using the X1 Carbon mostly for work, which largely involves using a web browser with lots and lots of open tabs, writing emails, researching, and the occasional Photoshopping. When I\u2019m off the clock, I used the X1 Carbon to stream videos and browse the web.\n\nI get great performance from the Intel eighth-generation Core i7 8665U coupled with 16 GB of RAM. For my workflow and expectations from a laptop, these are the specs I\u2019d go for. You can also get less powerful configurations of the X1 Carbon, with Intel\u2019s Core i5 and 8 GB of RAM, which should suit users looking for performance on more of a budget.\n\nAt the end of the day, both the Core i5 and the Core i7 offer four cores, which is key for multitasking \u2013 it\u2019s just that the Core i7 might do things a little faster.\n\nThe X1 Carbon review unit I\u2019m using has Intel\u2019s vPro technology I mentioned earlier, which adds a few hundred dollars to the price tag, but that\u2019s only for business uses. The X1 Carbon is available with Intel chips that don\u2019t come with vPro and cost hundreds less than those with vPro.\n\nThe Carbon X1 is also extremely quiet; I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever heard the fans spinning. That said, it can get a little hot on your right thigh \u2013 under where the chip resides inside \u2013 if you have the X1 Carbon on your lap, at least when you\u2019re doing more intensive tasks.\n\nNothing comes close to Apple\u2019s touchpads, but the X1 Carbon\u2019s gets the job done.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nThe X1 Carbon\u2019s touchpad has a similar rubbery, plastic texture as its body, but smoother. It works pretty well, but a glass touchpad, like what you\u2019d find on an Apple laptop, would have been better for smoother and more accurate finger motions.\n\nMy only major complaint with the touchpad is that I wish it were bigger \u2013 and there\u2019s plenty of space where it could be expanded. Right above the touchpad are the three mouse buttons designed to be used with the red IBM/Lenovo nubbin, and I wish they\u2019d made way for a larger touchpad.\n\nIf 13-inch screens are too small and 15-inch screens are too large, the X1 Carbon\u2019s 14-inch screen is just right.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nFor a while, it was 15-inch or nothing for me. But that often meant larger, less portable laptops. The X1 Carbon\u2019s 14-inch screen is the perfect compromise, especially as the X1 Carbon feels as compact and portable as a 13-inch laptop.\n\nThe bezels aren\u2019t as thin as those on the Dell XPS 13 and XPS 15, but they\u2019re not overwhelming, and the X1 Carbon still looks sleek and modern.\n\nThe model I\u2019m using now has a 4K UHD display, and it\u2019s sharp and bright. Colors are great too. Windows 10 and apps look great on this thing.\n\nThe 4K UHD screen option does a number on the X1 Carbon\u2019s battery life.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nLenovo claims the X1 Carbon has an 18-hour battery life, and I\u2019m certainly not getting that on the model with the 4K UHD screen.\n\nBattery life on the X1 Carbon configured with the 4K UHD screen isn\u2019t superb \u2013 it gives you just over six hours when doing something simple like writing up a document.\n\nIf you prize battery life, you\u2019ll likely do better with the WQHD 1440p or FHD 1080p screen options.\n\nOther bits and pieces.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nThe webcam has a physical switch that covers up the lens, which should appeal to anyone concerned about privacy.\n\nThe X1 Carbon with the FHD multitouch, WQHD, or 4K UHD screen options can be fitted with an IR camera that\u2019s compatible with Microsoft\u2019s Windows Hello facial recognition. All support fingerprint recognition. The fingerprint scanner is just to the right of the touchpad, which hasn\u2019t posed a problem.\n\nThe speakers on the X1 Carbon are surprisingly pretty good, but Apple\u2019s laptop speakers still have yet to be beaten.\n\nShould you buy this thing?\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nIt took under a minute for the X1 Carbon to make an impression on me. And it became apparent after about a day with the Lenovo X1 Carbon that it would likely become the next laptop I\u2019ll buy.\n\nIt has shifted my priorities to lightness and portability. It has strengthened my belief that laptops shouldn\u2019t be USB-C or nothing. It has convinced me that I can work on a laptop with a screen smaller than 15 inches. This thing has made an impact.\n\nThe only compromise is the battery life, which is affected by the 4K UHD screen. Had I configured the Lenovo X1 Carbon myself, I would have replaced the 4K UHD screen with a WQHD 1440p display for a little extra battery life. And that\u2019s something you can do when buying an X1 Carbon: It\u2019s highly customizable.\n\nApart from a larger, smoother touchpad, I wouldn\u2019t change a thing. It\u2019s a nearly perfect, well-priced, premium laptop.", "description": "Business Insider - Lenovo's ThinkPad laptops are often associated with \"business,\" but you'd be missing out if you dismissed the X1 Carbon..
