(AP) - Jan Bennett endured food poisoning, hail and near misses with tornado weather on her solo bicycle ride across the entire 2,220-mile (3,572-kilometer) Pony Express Trail from St. Joseph, Missouri, to Sacramento, California.\n\nThe former cycling road racer from Dallas, who made the trip as part of her effort to map out a bike-packing route along the historic trail knew it wouldn\u2019t be easy.\n\nBut she wasn\u2019t fully prepared for her toughest challenge yet in a remote piece of terrain in northern Nevada, where the climb was too steep and rough to ride and water was scarce.\n\nMore than 1,700 miles (2,735 kilometers) into the ride out of Missouri last year, she realized just how alone she was in a canyon north of Eureka.\n\n\u201cIt was a little bit of a gut check,\u201d Bennett told the Reno Gazette Journal in a recent interview.\n\n\u201cIt is in the middle of a really remote section of route,\u201d she said. \u201cI had the moment of, \u2018If something happens out here, I am kind of screwed\u2019.\u201d\n\nAs she slowly pushed her bike up the steep incline, she remembered an old piece of advice about endurance riding.\n\n\u201cIf you have to cry, cry while you are moving,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cIf you cry on the side of the road you still have to get up and cover that area.\u201d\n\nEleven days later, she pedaled into Sacramento.\n\nToday, Bennett hopes her work will help make the trail experience easier for future riders. And by highlighting a bicycle route that traces the Pony Express, she\u2019s tapping into a rich vein of American history that still enchants people today, nearly 160 years after the last rider hung up his satchel.\n\n\u201cThe thing about the Pony Express is it touches so many things in American history,\u201d said Jim DeFelice, author of \u201cWest Like Lightning: The Brief, Legendary Run of the Pony Express.\u201d\n\nThe express ran as the Civil War was unfolding and European settlers fueled by an expansionist government raced to stake claims to the vast natural resources and territory of the western U.S. The idea of riders traversing the territory by relay in 10 days captivated the nation.\n\n\u201cGod bless anybody who can bike that route. That is intense, man,\u201d DeFelice said. \u201cIn a way you are kind of replicating the experience.\u201d\n\nBike-packing is a combination of backpacking and cycling that\u2019s been around more than a century and in recent years gained popularity in the bicycling industry. In the U.S., bike-packing, unlike European-style touring on paved roads, is typically a backcountry sport in which riders follow single-track, two-track and remote dirt roads generally removed from cities and towns.\n\nBennett got her start in the sport in 2016 when she entered the Tour Divide, a race from Banff, Alberta, Canada to Antelope Wells, New Mexico on the Great Divide Route - one of the toughest races in North America.\n\nBennett made it about 400 miles (643 kilometers) before she threw in the towel when she suffered full body edema, which causes extremities to feel numb due to cold temperatures or stress.\n\nTwo months after dropping out of the race she embarked on another trip while she and her husband, Monte, were making their annual trip to Burning Man, where they help operate a bicycle-themed camp.\n\nHe dropped her off in Green River, Utah, more than 320 miles (515 kilometers) from the event near Gerlach, Nevada, so she could ride the rest of the way. It was her annual pilgrimages to Burning Man by car and bike that started her thinking about the Pony Express.\n\n\u201cThe reason I was drawn to it was how remote a lot of the route is,\u201d Bennett said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Reno Gazette-Journal, http://www.rgj.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jan Bennett endured food poisoning, hail and near misses with tornado weather on her solo bicycle ride across the entire 2,220-mile (3,572-kilometer) Pony Express Trail from St. Joseph, Missouri, to Sacramento, California.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
