Efforts have so far been in vain, as Telegram still remains accessible, while efforts could soon shift to the release of the company\u2019s own digital currency.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible to block it by blacklisting IP-addresses. That way, the battle will go on endlessly, even if you consider that Telegram\u2019s client part is open-source software whose inner workings can be analysed and comprehended,\u201d he said in an interview in May last year.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, competition in Bitcoin mining has heated up once again in 2019. Despite the mixed performance of Bitcoin itself, hash rate - or the combined computing power dedicated to mining - continues to hit all-time highs.\n\nBitmain, one of the industry\u2019s major mining participants, last week announced it would look to make its new facility in Texas the most powerful worldwide in the coming years.\n\nCompetitor Canaan Creative meanwhile filed for a $400 million initial public offering, or IPO, this week.", "description": "Dmitry Marinichev, Russia\u2019s internet ombudsman who criticized the state\u2019s attempt to block Telegram, plans to take over a closed metal factory to mine Bitcoin", "authors": ["William Suberg"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvOWM3NzgwMTZmMTAxM2VkNzk0MTJkYTc4MzVlZTUxZjAuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
