2018\n\nThe US invaded Afghanistan in October 2001, accusing the Taliban of harbouring Osama bin Laden and senior al-Qaeda figures linked to the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThey removed the Taliban from power, after which the militant group started a long-running insurgency across the country.\n\nUS troop numbers in Afghanistan grew as Washington poured in billions of dollars to fight the Taliban and fund reconstruction.\n\nBetween 2010 to 2012, when the US for a time had more than 100,000 soldiers in the country, the cost of the war grew to almost $100bn a year, according to figures provided by the US government.\n\nAs the US military shifted its focus away from offensive operations and concentrated more on training Afghan forces, costs fell sharply and between 2016 and 2018 annual expenditure was around $40bn.\n\nThe estimated spend for the year to March 2019 is $18bn.\n\nUS cost of war in Afghanistan 2001 - 2019\n\nSo, according to the US Department of Defense, the total military expenditure in Afghanistan (from October 2001 until March 2019) was $760bn.\n\nThat's significantly more than the figure given by the Afghan president.\n\nBut it doesn't include spending in Pakistan, which the US uses as a base for Afghan-related operations.\n\nAn independent study carried out by Brown University's Cost of War Project argues that the official US figures for the Afghan war are a substantial underestimate.\n\nIt says that Congress has approved funds amounting to about one trillion dollars for Afghanistan as well as for Pakistan.\n\nNeta Crawford, co-director of the Cost of the War Project, also says this \"does not include any of the other costs for war veterans' care, money spent on other government departments for war-related activities and the cost of interest on debt incurred to pay for the conflict,\"\n\nIf you factor this in, the cost is closer to two trillion dollars, she adds.\n\nWhere has the money gone?\n\nThe bulk of the money has been spent on counter-insurgency operations, and on the needs of US troops, such as food, clothing, medical care, special pay and benefits.\n\nOfficial data shows the US has also contributed approximately $133bn -16% of all money spent in the last 17 years - to reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan.\n\nAnd more than half of that ($83bn) has gone on building up Afghan security forces, including the Afghan National Army and police force.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Afghan security forces have suffered heavy casualties\n\nThe rest has been mainly spent on improving governance and infrastructure, as well as on economic and humanitarian aid and anti-drug initiatives.\n\nThe US has spent on average $1.5m day - or nearly $9bn since 2002 until June this year - on anti-narcotics efforts, yet the area devoted to growing opium poppy has actually increased, according to UN figures.\n\nIn 2017, the US watchdog responsible for the oversight of reconstruction efforts said that as much as $15.5bn had been lost on \"waste, fraud and abuse\" over the past 11 years.\n\nThat figure is probably \"only a portion\" of the total waste, according to the watchdog, which added that US money \"often exacerbated conflicts, enabled corruption, and bolstered support for insurgents\".\n\nWhat about the human cost?\n\nSince the war against the Taliban began in 2001, US forces have suffered 2,300 deaths and around 20,500 soldiers injured in action.\n\nAccording to official figures, approximately 14,000 US military personnel were in Afghanistan as of June 2018, but there were also nearly 11,000 US civilians who were working as contractors.\n\nBut US casualty figures are dwarfed by the loss of life among Afghan security forces and civilians.\n\nPresident Ghani said this year that more than 45,000 members of the Afghan security forces had been killed since he became president in 2014.\n\nTotal civilian casualties in Afghanistan 2009 - 2019*\n\nMr Ghani's decision to reveal casualty figures was unusual, as the US and Afghan governments don't normally publish Afghan death tolls.\n\nHowever, some reports say that Afghan security force fatalities have been very high in recent years, sometimes averaging 30-40 deaths a day.\n\nAnd according to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (Unama), more than 32,000 civilians have been killed and about 60,000 injured since it began systematically recording civilian casualties in 2009.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter", "description": "The US military has been in Afghanistan since 2001 -
