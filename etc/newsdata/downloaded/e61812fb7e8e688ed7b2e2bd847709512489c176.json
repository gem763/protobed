But the past months of political protests in Hong Kong have increasingly impacted the film business.\n\nBack in April, fees and conditions attached to mainland-Hong Kong co-productions were waived, as part of a five-point plan to treat the Special Administrative Area\u2019s once mighty film industry as welcome in the mainland, where the local industry has grown big and arrogant, but not yet mature.\n\nDropping the rules that required all mainland-Hong Kong co-productions to have mainland stories, and other regulations that put ceilings on the number of Hong Kong crew on each production, seemed set to help Hong Kong filmmakers tell their own stories and yet still to be able to attract mainland Chinese backing.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nOnly two days earlier, \u201cProject Gutenberg,\u201d a Hong Kong thriller starring local icon Chow Yun-fat, dominated the HK Film Awards had pointed to exactly that model. The film appeared to be right kind of co-production: intelligent and audience-pleasing, obviously steeped in Hong Kong crime thriller traditions, but without compromise. And it had attracted significant cross-border finance from Bona Film Group that was then amply repaid by a $183 million box office outcome in mainland theaters.\n\nIn the past year there have been other triumphs for Hong Kong movies, including \u201cStill Human,\u201d a Hong Kong parallel to \u201cThe Intouchables,\u201d and \u201cTracey,\u201d a promising first feature by Jun Li in which a man makes a full female transition.\n\nAt the commercial level, \u201cLine Walker 2\u201d \u201cP Storm\u201d and \u201cWhite Storm 2\u201d have delivered \u2014 and arguably improved on \u2014 successful franchise extensions with good box office at home and in the mainland.\n\nTop Hong Kong directors have been at work on both sides of the border. After \u201cOperation Red Sea,\u201d Dante Lam is preparing to dominate the 2020 Chinese New Year with \u201cThe Rescue.\u201d Andrew Lau produced the $220 million-grossing hit \u201cThe Bravest,\u201d and directed upcoming action drama \u201cThe Chinese Pilot.\u201d Tsui Hark earned $89 million last year with \u201cDetective Dee: The Four Heavenly Kings\u201d while Peter Chan is directing and producing a biopic of iconic mainland tennis star Li Na.\n\nThey appear to have benefited from the ability to produce their movies at one remove from the increasingly oppressive mainland censorship regime, and also have completed films that fill the releasing gap created by the abrupt mainland production slowdown that followed last year\u2019s Fan Bingbing tax scandal.\n\nOther industry insiders suggest that Chinese audiences have also rediscovered \u201cold school\u201d on-screen dynamism, of the kind that made Hong Kong a film export powerhouse from the 1970s to 1990s.\n\nBut the past three months of political infighting \u2014 where millions of people have taken to the street of Hong Kong to protest the reckless inertia of Lam\u2019s government and push back against mainland interference in their way of life \u2014 have now encroached on every aspect of Hong Kong society.\n\nIncreasingly, members of the film industry are being forced to choose whether they are in the pro-Beijing camp or on a more independent course, which carries the risk of being ostracized by mainland producers, distributors and regulators.\n\nTaking any stance is fraught with danger. By simply endorsing a Beijing-loyal message about the Hong Kong Police, Crystal Liu Yifei, star of the upcoming \u201cMulan,\u201d has caused an outcry in Hong Kong. The loss of Hong Kong box office is unlikely to significantly diminish the film\u2019s prospects, but in one tweet Liu has turned Disney\u2019s most expensive movie of all time into a poisonous political football.\n\nAnthony Wong, the award-winning star of \u201cStill Human,\u201d has said that job offers are scarce since he expressed pro-democracy sentiments. Singer-actress Denise Ho has surely torpedoed her movie career by becoming a prominent spokesman for the pro-democracy movement.\n\nWith tear gas now in almost daily use on Hong Kong streets, and the Chinese army massed in Shenzhen (ironically, part of the Greater Bay Area, with which politicians would have Hong Kong economically unite) other folk have visibly moved to the sidelines.", "description": "After a busy FilMart in March, at which Hong Kong\u2019s film industry leaders promised to lobby for greater access to mainland audiences, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam was able, only a month later, to announce that the lobbying had succeeded.
